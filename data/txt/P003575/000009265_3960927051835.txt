HUBEI PHOSPHATE PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:           The People's Republic of China
Beneficiaries:     Jinxiang Phosphate Chemical Company (JPCC, Hubei Province);
Huangmailing Phosphate Chemical Company (HPCC, Hubei Prov-
ince); Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI)
Loan Amount:       US$137.0 million equivalent
Terms of Loan:      20-year repayment, including 5 years of grace, at the stan-
dard variable interest rate
On-lending Terms:  The Government will on-lend the loan proceeds, through the
Hubei provincial government, to the two Project companies
at an on-lending rate equal to 105% of the IBRD variable
rate, with a repayment period of 20 years, including 5
years of grace. The commitment charge and foreign exchange
risks will be passed on to the companies.
Project
Objectives:      The Project will assist China in achieving its priority for
the fertilizer sector under the Seventh and Eighth Five-
Year Plans (1986-95), which is to reduce the nutrient
imbalance in fertilizer use by expanding the production
capacity for phosphate fertilizers, particularly high-grade
products such as monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and triple
superphosphate (TSP), based on domestic phosphate
resources. More specifically, the Project will help GOC
to: (a) implement the integrated development of two major
phosphate mines and their downstream high-grade fertilizer
complexes, the first such operations in China in terms of
size and configuration; and (b) strengthen MCI's project
management capabilities and the capacity cf Chinese design
institutes to identify and analyze potential safety hazards
and plant operability in chemical plant design and opera-
tions. The major investments to be implemrnted under the
Project are consistent with the overall dLvelopment strate-
gies worked out through the Phosphate Subsector Study (the
Study), which was carried out during project preparation
jointly by the Bank and MCI and which resulted in a phos-
phate subsector investment program to the year 2000. The
project investments which comprise the integrated develop-
ment of domestic phosphate deposits and fertilizers using
modern mining, beneficiation and fertilizer production
technologies, are also expected to serve as models for the
future development of the fertilizer sector. The Project



- ii -
will increase China's local supply of phosphate fertilizers
by about 25Z.
Project
Descriptiont      The Project has three componentst  (a) Dayukou mine and
fertilizer developmernt - initiation of a new open-pit mine
of 1.5 Mtpy ROM rock capacity, construiction of a bereficia-
tion plant, and establishment of a 560,000 t-py TSP ferti-
lizer complex; (b) Huang&ailin& mine and fertilizer devel-
opment - expansion of the capacity of an existing opern-pit
mine from 0.3 Mtpy ROM rock to J.0 Mtpy, constrlictiozn of a
beneficiation plant, rehabilita:ion of a small low-grade
nitrogenous fertilizer plant to supply ammoinla as feedstock
for MAP production, and establishment of a l0,O000 tpy MAP
plant near the mine site; and (c) technical assistance -
consulting services for project implementation, technology
selection, production start-up and mine workshop mainte-
nance and for training on modern methodologies for Hazard
and Operability (HAZOP) analysis.
Project Benefits   The Project will generate indirectly significant economic
and Risks:        benefits in agriculture by reducing the nutrient imbalance
and increasing the synergism of fertilizer application. No
extraordinary commercial risk are foreseen, given the
general shortage of phosphate fertilizers and the
apparently buoyant Chinese fertilizer market. The main
technical risks relate to the need for coordinated imple-
mentation and commissioning of high-grade phosphate ferti-
lizer plants and associated mines. In the past, the lack
of proper coordination has been a persistent problem in
implementing integrated mine and fertilizer investments,
executed by separate entities under separate budgets. This
risk will be mitigated by implementing both mine develop-
ment and fertilizer plant construction under the same
project management team and from the same budget, as well
as by assurances of diligent monitoring and coordination
from the Government. The risk will be further mitigated by
involving internationally experienced consultants under the
technical assistance component; they will assist MCI's
project coordination team and the project companies with
project implementation and production start-up. In addi-
tion, the project coripanies will undertake comprehensive
staff recruitment and training .rograms for core opera-
tional and maintenance personnel during Project implementa-
tion.

CHINA
HUBEI PHOSPHATE PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      The Government of the People's Republic of China (the Government,
GOC) has requested a Bank loan of US$137.0 million equivalent to finance a
Hubei Phosphate Project for (the ProJect). The Project embodies an evolution
of the Bank's fertilizer operations in China, geared toward broadening the
impact of Bank support for developing and improving the efficiency of the
entire fertilizer sector.  The Fertilizer Rehabilitation and Energy Saving
Project (Loan 2541-CHA, FY85), the first Ba fertilizer operation, supports
the rehabilitation of four large and one medium-sized nitrogenous fertilizer
plants. The subsequent Fertilizer Rationalization Project (Loan 2838-CHA,
FY87) aims to demonstrate alternatives for improving production efficiency at
medium-size nitrogenous fertilizer plants, which currently produce low-grade
fertilizers, by converting products from five such plants into high-grade
fertilizers. It also aims to strengthen sector-wide institutional efficiency
by introducing improved management systems at the enterprise level. The
Phosphate Development Project (Loan 2958-CHA, FY88), the third Bank-supported
operation in the fertilizer sector in China (which was prepared and appraised
concurrently with the Project), broadens the Bank's involvement beyond the
nitrogenous fertilizer subsector. It supports the development of a large-
scale, modern phosphate mine in Guizhou Province which would provide high-
quality phosphate concentrates to several downstream fertilizer plants.
Through the Phosphate Sector Study carried out during the preparation of the
third project and this project (prepared concurrently), a subsectoral approach
to Bank assistance was initiated, with the Bank providing financial and tech-
nical support to the Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI) for the design of
subsector-wide strategies. That effort resulted in the preparation of an
optimal investment program that would allow China to meet its rapidly growing
demand for phosphate fertilizers in the least-cost manner.
1.2      Consistent with the overall development strategies and investment
program worked out under the above Study, the Project will support: (a) inte-
grated development of two pnosphate mines in Hubei Province and their down-
stream high-grade phosphate fertilizer (MAP and TSP) plants at the mine sites;
and (b) provision of consultant services to MCI's project coordination team
and the project companies for project implementation, technology selection,
production start-up, and mine workshop maintenance.
1.3      The Project investments were initially identified in 1985, and were
prepared and appraised by the Bank's project team as part of the Phosphate
Development Project in December 1987. However, GOC wished to delay the loan
processing for these investments and prepare a separate project on a different
schedule as its own internal review of them was getting delayed. Considering
the urgency of developing the Guizhou mine in time for the commissioning of
downstream fertilizer plants currently under construction, the remaining por-
tion of the Phosphate Development Project was processed according to the ori-



- 2
ginal schedule, and presented to the Board in June 1988. Key parameters of
the Project were updated during postappraisal in February 1989. The earlier
Phosphate Subsector Study was carried out during 1986-88.
1.4      This report recommends a Bank loan of US$137.0 million equivalent,
which would cover 26.82 of the total financing required and 84.5Z of the total
foreign exchange financing tequired (equivalent to 98.3% of the foreign com-
ponent of the installed cost).
II. AN OVERVIEW OF THE CHINESE INDUSTRY
A. General Industry Background
2.1      Industry is China's largest productive sector, accounting for nearly
47X of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employing 18% of the total labor
force. About 97,600 state enterprises generate 62X of total industrial out-
put, the remainder being produced by more than a million non-state
enterprises, mainly urban and rural collectives. While state enterprises
produce mainly important raw materials, capital goods and strategic
commodities such as fertilizers, and light industrial and consumer goods, most
non-state enterprises are involved in the production of downstream consumer
products. Gross industrial output amouinted to Y 1,381 billion (US$371
billion) in 1987. The chemical industry, which produces mainly fertilizers,
petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals, accounted for 10% of the total industrial
output.
2.2      The grois value of industrial production has grown rapidly !etween
1978 and 1987, at a rate of over 10.8X in real terms per year. This growth
reflects in large part the high rate of capital accumulation in industry.
Until the late 1970s, when the Government began to view external trade as an
important element of economic development, Chinese industry was oriented
mainly toward the domestic market. Since then, Chinese manufactured exports
have grown rapidly from around US$9 billion equivalent in 1980 to about US$26
billion equivalent in 1987. The share of exports in industrial output was
7.4Z in 1987.
2.3      China's industrial development has been constrained by several struc-
tural deficiencies which stemmed mainly from rigid economic planning and the
past industrial strategies oriented towards self-sufficiency at the national
and regional levels. Major deficiencies include outdated technologies,
institutional rigidities stemming in part from quota and price controls, a
distorted structure of prices, inadequate infrastructure, and an under-
developed financial sector. Reflecting these problems, labor productivity and
the efficiency of resource use for Chinese plants are low. Nearly 80% of the
current capital stock is obsolete and needs replacement or technical renova-
tion. The industry structure is biased toward basic, heavy industry. An
over-emphasis on self-sufficiency at the regional level has also led to a
fragmented national market, reduced domestic competition, and the suboptimal
use of scarce skills and resources. Consequently, potential gains from econ-
omies of scale are often missed. Institutional inflexibility, compounded by
inadequate market integration, has provided little incentives for industrial



enterprises to improve managerial efficiency and product quality. The low
prices of energy and basic intermediates for industrial production also con-
tribute to the inefficient use of inputu. nvestments in infrastructure,
particularly for transportation and telecomriunication, have lagged behind
those in industry. This in turn has posed a major constraint to industrial
development. The financial markets, which are in their infancy, have until
recently only provided limited intermediation services for enterprises.
B. Government Objectives and Strategy for Industrial Development
2.4      Since 1979, the Chinese Government has shifted the focus of indus-
trial development towards light industry and introduced incentives and market
forces as a means of improving economic efficiency under ongoing economic
reforms. The development strategy has emphasized modernization of existing
equipment, development of manufactured exports and more efficient light
industry, and material and energy conservation in industry. Price reforms,
which the Government views as one of the most important elements of the on-
going economic reforms, are designed to gradually reduce distortions to
enhance allocative economic efficiency, particularly by allowing market forces
to play a greater role in price determination. Since the start of economic
reforms, the prices of major industrial inputs, including energy, have been
raised significantly qo that effect. Recently the worries relating to the
inflationary implications of these reforms have resulted in a cautious
approach, and the reform process has been temporarily slowed at present.
However, price reforms remain a critical item on the Government's reform
agenda. Reforms adopted in 1984 aim to decentralize economic decision-making
toward the provinces and enterprises, and make greater use of market signals
to provide production incentives. State enterprise reforms, which include
irT'roduction of the contract management responsibility system and, uniform
profit tax rates (55Z) and wage incentives, have provided greater autonomy and
more appropriate incentives for enterprise management. However, significant
distortions in relative prices still remain, and the objective of replacing
the traditionally "soft" enterprise budget constraint has yet to be achieved.
Reforms in the financial sector have focused on reducing the role of central
planning in the economy by increasing competition among existing and new
financial institutions and the introduction of new types of financial instru-
ments. The reforms are being implemented at different paces among the regions
and subsectors. Because of the nature and structure of the fertilizer sector,
the process of decentralization has already progressed to a greater degree
than in some other industrial sectors.
C. Bank Support for Industry
2.5      The Bank Group's industrial lending operations in China began in
December 1982 with the approval of a loan of US$70.6 million to finance the
First China Investment Bank Project (Loan/Credit 2226/1313-CHA, FY83). Three
additional loans/credits of US$575 million to the China Investment Bank (CIB)
(Loan/Credit 2434/1491-CHA in FY84; Loan/Credit 2659/1594-CHA in FY86; and
Loan/Credit 2783/1763-CHA in FY87) have been approved subsequently. The main
purpose of the CIB operations has been to develop CIB as the premier financial
intermediary providing term financing for small- and medium-sized enterprises.
CIB operations to date have supported a wide range of subsectors, including:
textile, light industry, electronics, food processing, pharmaceuticals, pack-



- 4 -
aging materials, machinery and spare parts, building materials, chemicals and
metallurgical, and other, in a number of provinces. Disbursementl of the CIB
loans and cred..~s have, apart from some delays in the first operation, pro-
ceeded satisfactorily. Altiuough CIB's manoower and system require further
strengthening, the basis of a sound development bank in China has been estab-
lished.
2.6      Besides the four CIB operations, Bank involvement in the industrial
sector comprisess (a) three fertilizer loans, totaling US$257.3 million (para.
1.1); (b) a loan of US$100 million for the Shanghai Machine Tool Project (Loan
2784-CHA, FY87), involving rehabilitation and modernization of the machine
tool sector in Shanghai; (c) a loan of US$128 million for the Pharmaceuticals
Project (Loan 2943-CHA, FY88), to expand pharmaceutical production using
modern technologies and improve manufacturing practices; (d) a regional
development project for Gansu Province (Loan 2812-CHA, and Credit 1793-CHA,
FY87), including an industrial development component of US$20 million, to be
used for diversification and modernization of the predominantly rural indus-
trial base in the province; and (e) a loan of US$154 million for the Tianjin
Light Industry Project (Loan 3022-CHA, FY89) to support the restructuring of
three important subsectors (textile dyeing and finishing, pulp and paper, and
packaging) of the light industry in Tianjin Municipality. Physical implemen-
tation of the three fertilizer projects is proceeding generally on schedule.
A Planning Support and Special Studies Project, which includes components for
supporting long-term planning activities in selected subsectors including
petrochemicals, was approved in June 1987. No Project Completion Reports
(PCRs) have been prepared on any of the above projects. The International
Financial Corporation (IFC) has provided support of US$44.3 million equivalent
(equity participation of US$4.3 million and loans of US$40.0 million) since
its first operation in 1985, through the following five investments:
Guangzhou and Peugeot Automobile Co., Ltd. (Investment No. 813, FY85), China
Investment Co., Ltd. (Investment No. 974, FY87), Shenzhen China Bicycles Co.,
Ltd. (Investment No. 1020, PY87), Shenzhen Crown Electronics Co., Ltd.
(Investment No. 1066, FY88), and Shenzhen Chronar Solar Energy Co., Ltd.
(Investment No. 1119, FY89).
2.7      The Bank's overall objectives in support of China's industrial
development are to assist the Government in: (a) improving the policy frame-
work for the industrial sector as a whole; (b) building sound institutions and
practices for financial intermediation, subsector planning, project approval
and implementation; (c) promoting and implementing technology upgrading, plant
restructuring and rehabilitation, and energy and material conservation in
selected sectors at the national and provincial levels; and (d) carrying out
the reforms needed in the financial system.
2.8      Specific plans include further support for both CIB and other finan-
cial intermediaries and industrial enterprises in the overall sector reform
now under way, assistance to selected major subsectors at the national and
provincial levels: fertilizers, pharmaceuticals and machine tools, and the
development of broad-based industrial lending operations at the provincial
level, involving restructuring of major subsectors. The increasing devolution
of planning and implementation responsibility to the provinces has the poten-
tial to have a significant impact on industrial development provided that the
provincial authorities can effectively formulate and carry out their new role.
The anticipated series of provincial operations is designed to help selected



- 5 -
provinces articulate and implement their new responsibilities. The Bank's
program for economic and sectcr work in industry and finance has prov,ded the
basis for an active dialogue with the Government.  Major studies completed so
far include those on the state enterprise management system, finance and
investment, external trade and capital, and phosphate subsector planning.
Further work is being carried out and is planned in such areas as tax reform,
enterprise and financial reforms, and several subsector studies at the
national and provincial levels. This work is increasingly being carried out
jointly with Chinese agencies.
2.9      The various reform measures introduced in recent years have expanded
significantly the scope for non-state enterprises, mainly urban and rural
collectives. The environment for foreign investment in China has also
improved significantly since the promulgation of the joint venture law in
1979. Bank operations designed to assist the rapidly growing non-state sector
are contemplated. For example, assistance to the rural industrial sector is
expected through support for the Government's SPARK program, and CIB, hitherto
the major beneficiary of Bank support for financial intermediation, is
expected to gradually expand its financing of non-state enterprises and joint
ventures. IFC support for the Chinese industrial sector has hitherto been
limited to export-oriented joint ventures. With minor exceptions only, joint
ventures are required to earn their own foreign exchange to service foreign
obligations, which in turn has tended to make it difficult for IFC to support
import substituting joint ventures; most potential joint venture partners in
China are interested in the domestic market. As part of the ongoing economic
and sector dialogue, both the Bank and IFC have proposed major changes in the
foreigni exchange allocation and management system designed to alleviate these
difficulties. The growing importance and role of the foreign exchange cen-
ters, which were established recently in important trading cities and prov-
inces, have the potential for alleviating this constraint.
III. THE FERTILIZER SECTOR
A. Agricultural Background
3.1      The agriculture sector in China employs some 190 million farm
families and accounts for about 34X of the country's GDP. Although it has a
shortage of cultivatable land--only 102 of China's 960 million hectares (ha)
is cultivated, compared with 75Z in India--China has achieved self-sufficiency
in its basic food requirements. That accomplishment is all the more remark-
able given that China has 22% of the world's population but only 8% of its
cultivated area. The reasor. for this success is intensive cultivation prac-
tices, with relatively heavy inputs of labor, chemical and organic ferti-
lizers, and water per unit of land. Foodgrains occupy about 70Z of the total
cultivated area. Cotton is the most important industrial crop.
3.2      The agricultural sector has performed exceptionally well since 1979,
when the Government introduced a new agricultural incentive program, the
"production responisibility system (PRS).n Reflecting these initiatives, the
gross value of agricultural production increased by 10% p.a. over the period
1980-86, compared to an average of 3% p.a. in the preceding 20 years. Major
changes that have taken Dlace under the PRS include: (a) a larger role for



-6-
farm households, which now function as the fundamental units of agricultural
production and management; (b) replacement of the mandatory procurement quota
with voluntary contracts, which gives farmers more flexibility in determining
what to grow and where to sell; (c) price increases for major farm products;
and (d) the introduction of some flexibility in prices for deliveries of cer-
tain products by collectives and individual producers in excess of contracted
targets.
B. Fertilizer Use in Agriculture
3.3      While China is the third largest user of chemical fertilizers and the
largest consumer of nitrogen in the world, the level of fertilizer use in
1985--167 kg of nutrients per hectare of culti"zated land--was still only about
a third of that in neighboring countries such as Japan and Korea (see Annex
3.1 for a comparison with other countries). The implication is that the
potential for increased fertilizer use is large. Since expansion of the cul-
tivated area is not feasible, increasing and more balanced fertilizer use will
remain central to China's strategy for increased agricultural output.
3.4      At present, there is an imbalance in the use of nitrogen (N), phos-
phate (P205) and potash (K20) fertilizers. China's low application of phos-
phate and potash (para. 3.6) reduces the synergistic benefits that could
derive from the relatively high level of nitrogen application. This imbalance
is a major constraint to increasing the application of nitrogenous
fertilizers. Compared with the application rates in the other countries given
in Annex 3.1, China's level of application of phosphate and potash fertilizers
is quite low. According to results from surveys by the Ministry of Agricul-
ture, Animal Husbandry and Fishery (MAAF) during 1981-83, the soil throughout
73.4X of the cultivated area was deficient in phosphate, and 39.8X of it was
seriously deficient.
C.  Fertilizer Demand and Supply
3.5      Table 3.A summarize the consumption, producti(n and importation of
chemical fertilizers from 1974 to 1986 and presents projections of these acti-
vities for 1990 and 1995 (greater detail can be found in Annex 3.2).

Custom and FAD.
3.6             Fertilizer Demand.  The consumption of all fertilizers increased from
4.2 million tons per year of nutrients (tpyn) in 1975 to 19.3 million tpyn in
1986, representing an average annual growth rate of 14.1Z. Growth in nitrogen
consumption, which increased at an average annual rate of 14.1Z during
1972-81, has slowed in recent years, mainly because the level of nitrogen
application is relatively high, especially compared to the use of phosphate
and potash fertilizers, whose supplies are limited. The consumption of
phosphate and potash showed average growth rates of 11.0? and 37.91
respectively,l/ during 1972-86; this coincides with the Government's
continued emphasis on increasing their application to improve the overall
nutrient balance.
1/ Potash consumption has grown very quickiy from its low base in the
early 1970s, but it is still very low.



3.7      China also has a long history of using organic fertilizer.  This will
continue to be a valuable source of nutrients and will complement further
increases in the use of chemical fertilizer. Total nutrients supplied by
organic fertilizers in 1986 are estimated at about 15 million tons.
3.8      Based on its agricultural targets, the Government has projected that
the demand for chemical fertilizer will reach 27.9 million tpyn in 1995, with
implied average annual growth rates of about 2.0X for nitrogen (N) 6.9% for
phosphorous (P205) and 13.2X for potassium (K20). These projections appear to
be somewhat conservative, based on the limited supplies of phosphate and
potash fertilizers. According to MAAF, ths desirable long-term target for the
ratio of these nutrients is 100:50:20, compared with a current ratio of
100:33:8. GOC plans to achieve the target by 1995 by rapidly expanding the
consumption of phosphate and potash fertilizers. However, it may be difficult
to satisfy these requirements owing to domestic raw material constraints for
potash and limited financial resources for investments and imports.
3.9      Fertilizer Supply.  China has about 1,900 operating fertilizer plants
of varying types and sizes and is the world's third largest producer of chem-
ical fertilizers after the USSR and the US. Chemical fertilizer production
increased from 3.7 million tpyn in 1972 to 14.6 million tpyn in 1984, and then
fell to 13.2 million tpyn in 1985. In 1986, production reached 14.0 million
tpyn. Juring 1972-86, phosphate fertilizer production increased at a modest
rate of 4.6%, while nitrogenous fertilizer production increased at the much
faster rate of 11.82 p.a. For potash the figure was 8.5Z.
3.10     The decline in domestic production of both nitrogenous and phosphate
fertilizers in 1985 was mainly due to the Government's decision to close some
200 of the small, inefficient plants. These plants produced low quality, low
nutrient fertilizers such as ammonium bicarbonate (ABC), single superphosphate
(SSP), and calcium magnesium phosphate (CMP). The Government took this step
in response to diminishing demand for these fertilizers. Despite the aggres-
sive buildup of capacity for high-grade fertilizers in recent years, a signi-
ficant portion of the fertilizer production in China still is low grade: in
1985, only 30% of nitrogen production and 2X of phosphate production involved
high-grade products such as urea (46% N), MAP (522 P205) and TSP (46% P205).
3.11     China plans to continue expanding its production capacity for chem-
ical fertilizer, particularly high-grade phosphate fertilizer, during the
Seventh and Eighth Five-Year Plan periods (1986-95). It also intends to
rationalize existing low-grade fertilizer production facilities, by converting
their products to high-grade fertilizers. New large- ard medium-scale
fertilizer plants to be completed during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period 2/
are expected to increase China's high-grade fertilizer production capacity by
approximately 1.2 Mtpy of N, 0.6 Mtpy of P205, and 0.1 Mtpy of K20. Projects
under the Eighth Five-Year Plan, which is currently being formulated, are
expected to include further expansion in capacity for chemical fertilizers of
2/ Two 1,740 tpd urea plants, three 800 tpd DAP plants, a 400 tpd DAP
plant, a 2,970 tpd nitrophosphate plant, a 500 tpd nitrophosphate
plant, an 1,800 tpd NPK plant, a 500 tpd NPK plant, and 200,000 tpy
potassium-chloride plant.



2.0 Mtpy of N and 1.9 Mtpy of P205.3/   During 1986-95, all medium-size plants
currently producing low-grade fertilizer will be converted to high-grade pro-
duction.
3.12     Fertilizer Demand and Supply Balance.  Despite the impressive build-
up in production capacity during the last decade, and continued expeditious
expansion of capacity planned under the Seventh and Eighth Five-Year Plans,
China will need to continue importing fertilizers to meet expected domestic
demand. In 1986, about 16% of China's apparent total consumption (domestic
production plus net imports) of chemical fertilizers was met by imports (122
for nitrogen, 24% for phosphate and 96Z for potash), at a value of over US$1.1
billion p.a., making China the world's largest net importer of fertilizers.
As Table 3.A shows, the overall fertilizer deficit is projected to increase
from 2.9 million tons of nutrients in 1986 to 8.0 million tons in 1990 and 9.9
million tons in 1995. If the foreign exchange situation permics, this deficit
will be met by imports.
D. Structure of the Fertilizer Industry
3.13     Production.  Except for 16 large-size urea plants (about 280,000 tpy
of ammonia each), most of China's approximately 1,900 fertilizer plants (about
1,200 producing nitrogenous and 700 phosphate nutrients) are using outdated
technology and do not conform to current irternational production norms. This
is because most of China's fertilizer plants were built using indigenous
design, technology and equipment reflecting the industry's early policy of
relying on local technology and available raw materials as much as possible.
Because of the outdated technology at the majority of these plants, the level
of energy consumption of fertilizer production has been high.
3.14     The reliance on local technology was modifiec, in the early 1970s.
During that decade and the early 1980s, China built 15 large nitrogenous fer-
tilizer plants using imported technology and equipment. Almost all plants
currently under construction are based on internationally proven imported
technologies.
3.15     Feedstock.  China uses a variety of locally available feedstocks for
fertilizer production. The large-size nitrogenous fertilizer plants use
natural gas, naphtha and fuel oil as feedstocks for ammonia production, while
the small- and medium-size plants mainly use coal. The small-size phosphatic
fertilizer plants use low-grade phosphate rock to produce SSP and CMP. The
large- and medium-size high-grade phosphatic fertilizer plants under construc-
tion or consideration will be based on both domestic phosphate rock and
imported phosphoric acid.
E. Fertilizer Marketing and Distribution
3.16     Fertilizer Allocation.  In May 1985, the Government changed its
approach to fertilizer allocation by introducing a new contract system for the
procurement of farm output (see para. 3.2). In the past, it allocated ferti-
lizer according to a state allocation plan in exchange for agricultural
3/ Ten high-grade phosphate fertilizer plants with a capacity of
240,000-480,000 tpy DAP or 400,000-800,000 tpy TSP, and five large-size
urea plants.



- 10 -
products acquired through the state procurement system. The current contract
system gives both farmers and the Government more flexibility in allocating
fertilizer by reducing the quantities covered by the state allocation plan.
Fertilizer producers thus are able to sell an increasing portion of their
production outside the state plan, sometimes directly to farmers and across
provincial boundaries. However, the state procurement system still accounts
for about 60? of total fertilizer consumption and about 85Z of the high-grade
fertilizers, including urea and DAP.
3.17     Fertilizer Marketing.  About 90? of chemical fertilizer is marketed
through the Agricultural Means of Production Corporation (AMPC), a state-owned
company under the Ministry of Commerce (MOC). AMPC handles all fertilizer
under the state allocation quota and a significant portion of the above-quota
production. Producers sell the balance directly to farmers. AMPC procures
fertilizer from the domestic plants and China Chemical Export and Import Cor-
poration (SINOCHEM)--the agency responsible for all imports of chemical ferti-
lizers under the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. AMPC has
some 2,500 offices at the national (accounting for about 202 of AKPC's total
purchases), provincial (282), and county (52Z) levels. The county-level
offices sell fertilizers to farmers through: (a) about 64,000 retail coopera-
tive shops (about 50? of AMPC's total sales); (b) some 110,000 retail shops
(32Z); and (c) direct sales (18Z).
3.18     Fertilizer Transportation.  So far, the transportation system has
been able to move the large and growing quantity of fertilizer, about 94
million product tons in 1986. The transport of fertilizer has been given
priority to ensure its availability for farmers. Fertilizer is moved, mainly
in bagged form, from plants and ports directly to a network of county-level
AMPC warehouses located close to the consuming areas. While high-grade ferti-
lizers such as urea and DAP are hauled long distances by rail, low-grade fer-
tilizer such as ABC and SSP from small plants generally located near the con-
suming areas is transported mainly by road. Ab6ut one-third of the total
fertilizer distributed in China moves by rail. River transportation also
plays an important role.
3.19     Fertilizer Storage.  Fertilizer storage capacity has not been ade-
quate in recent years to meet the peak storage requirements. given the rise in
consumption.  The AMPC operates storage facilities for fertilizers at various
levels.  Total capacity at these facilities is equivalent to three months of
national fertilizer consumption.  AMPC warehouses at the national, provincial
and county levels account for half the total storage capacity; the rest of the
warehouses are located in the countryside at AMPC's retail shops.  To reduce
the storage burden and its carrying costs, AMPC is encouraging farmers to buy
fertilizers during the off-season by offering rebates. The shortage of ware-
housing capacity at periods of peak storage demand will be alleviated grad-
ually as high-grade fertilizers replace low-grade ones, since the former have
a lower volume.
F. Fertilizer Pricing
3.20     Trends under the Price Reforms.  GOC has embarked on a major effort
to reform the prevailing system of prices in the country (para. 2.4). Given
the Government's concern for macroeconomic management and the obvious sensiti-



- 11 -
vities involved, the pace of reform inevitably will vary from sector to sector
and over time. Recently the Government has taken a cautious approach to over-
all price reforms due to concerns about their inflationary implications (para.
2.4). However, the overall direction of reform has been clearly set. The
ongoing economic reforms involve expansion of the role of market forces in
fertilizer production and allocation. In the past, the Government
administered fertilizer prices strictly, as it did those of other essential
commodities. The current strategy assigns a greater role to market forces in
fertilizer pricing and allocation so as to improve the efficiency of produc-
tion and application. As a result, a two-tier pricing system has emerged.
The State Pricing Bureau (SPB) and local (province, city and county) bureaus
set the prices for the production subject to the state plan quotas at both the
ex-factory and farm-gate levels. Market-influenced prices negotiated within
the limits of guideline retail prices set by local pricing authorities prevail
for production outside the state plan quota.4/   Fertilizer producers market
these products directly.
3.21     At present, about 402 of total consumption is sold at negotiated
prices, although the percentage varies significantly across products and
localities and with the financial situation of individual manufacturers. In
general, high-grade fertilizers are subject to stricter state allocation.
About S5% of these products, including urea and DAP, are being sold at con-
trolled prices under the state allocation plan.
3.22     The Government views the two-tier pricing system as an intermediate
step in the evolution of sectoral pricing policy, given its well-recognized
limitations, including: (a) discrimination across producers and consumers;
(b) administrative complexity; and (c) distortions and time lags in the
adjustment of the prices of inputs and outputs. Despite these limitations,
the Government expects to use this transitional system until it introduces a
broader price reform package. The reason is partly the close inter-
relationship between fertilizer and the agricultural sector and the potential
for disruption if the allocation and pricing arrangements for fertilizers were
to be liberalized in isolation.
3.23     The Government's strategy is to continue gradually reducing its
administrative control of fertilizer pricing in parallel with the gradual
dismantling of annual production planning and allocation, so that the economy
can "grow out of the plan." Guidelines for future policy reforms are being
developed by an inter-agency working group that is carrying out a compre-
hensive review of the fertilizer pricing and allocation policies according to
a program discussed with the Bank. Through these reforms, GOC is committed to
removing the irrationalities in the price relationships between inputs, ferti-
lizers and agricultural products. The working group is headed by the Director
of the Department for Heavy Industry and Communication and comprises repre-
sentatives from related Government agencies, including the Ministry of Finance
(MOF), MCI, MOC, MAAF and China Petrochemical Corporation (SINOPEC). However,
4/ At present, there is a ceiling on the negotiated prices of all high-
grade fertilizers, such as urea and MAP, at the retail level. This
ceiling currently is set by the SPB, but in the future it will be set
by provincial authorities following guidelines to be given by the SPB.



- 12 -
specific guidelines are expected to emerge only after the agenda for further
overall price reforms is firmly in place (para. 2.4).
3.24     Fertilizer Prices.  The ex-factory prices of major high-grade fert-
ilizers and ABC, the delivered prices of the main inputs, and farmers' prices
for major grains, together with comparable international border prices in
1988, are shown in Annex 3.3. Presently, the controlled ex-factory prices of
urea and DAP are below the border prices, while their negotiated prices are
close to the economic prices. In December 1988, the controlled bagged urea
price--Y 428 (US$115)/ton--represented about 62% of the CIF import price of
US$185/ton, while the ceiling for the nei iated price quota, which differs
among provinces and is set by respective provincial pricing authorities, was
95-102Z of the economic value. For DAP, the figures are, for plan quota,
Y 570 (US$153)/ton, equivalent to 67% of the current import parity price of
US$229, and for the negotiated price, Y 700-860 (US$188-231), or 82-101Z. At
present, there is no local production of TSP and MAP, and controlled ex-
factory prices therefore have not been established. The ceilings for nego-
tiated prices for future TSP and MAP production are expected to be set in line
with those for DAP. The Government provides subsidies to make up the differ-
ence between the import and sale prices for imported fertilizers. Actual
negotiated ex-factory prices have usually been equal or close to the ceiling;
reflecting market conditions, these prices have frequently exceeded the ceil-
ing, with approval from the pricing authorities, at least during the peak
season.
3.25     An average distribution margin of about Y 140 (US$38/ton of product)
is added to the ex-factory price of high-grade fertilizer at the farm-gate
level to cover AMPC's transport and storage costs.
3.26     During negotiations, an assurance was obtained from the Government
that the Project companies would be allowed to market their entire output (TSP
and MAP) outside the state allocation plan at negotiated prices.
3.27     Prices of Fertilizer Inputs Relative to Fertilizers.  The price
structure of major inputs is also similar to that of fertilizers. However,
there are no country-wide uniform prices for these inputs, and the controlled
prices applied to individual suppliers are set by each supplier's respective
supervisory pricing authority at the central, provincial and county levels.
Although these prices vary to a large extent depending on the quality of
product and the location and geological condition of supply sources, on the
whole they are far below their border prices. The controlled price of natural
gas under the state allocation quota is around 55-65% of its fuel oil equiva-
lent value, based on border prices. The controlled price of coal is 65-75Z of
its export value. The average ex-mine controlled price of domestic phosphate
rock, the quality of which is usually too low to be tradeable in the inter-
national market, is about 45% of the import parity price based on nutrient
contents. Negotiated prices above the quota are generally 15-25% higher than
the controlled prices; although in some cases they have, subject to approval
by pricing authorities, approached border prices. The entire production of
phosphate concentrate from Wengfu mine, to be developed under the Bank-
supported Phosphate Development Project (Loan 2958-CHA, FY88), will be allowed
to be sold outside the state allocation plan at market influenced negotiated
prices.



- 13 -
3.28     Prices of Fertilizers Relative to Agricultural Products.  The price
structure of agcicultural products is similar to that of fertilizers. Agri-
cultural products traded by the state procurement system are subject to con-
trolledI prices. While some exceptions exist, the prices of these products
generally are below border prices, while the market-influenced negotiated
prices more closely approximate the border prices. For example, as of January
1988, thR controlled price ef rice was Y 632 (UTS$167)/ton, about 65Z of its
export value of US$258/ton, whereas its negotiated price was Y 840 (US$226)/
ton (Annex 3.2). The controlled price of wheat was Y 328 (US$119)/ton, about
682 of the CIF in.port price of US$1.75, the negotiated price, Y 500 (US$161)/
ton.
G. Government SLrategy in the Fertilizer Sector
3.29     In view of its importance to agriculture, the fertilizer sector has
been, and will continue to be, a sector of high priority for the allocation of
investment resources.  In recent years, the Government rei.erated this
priority on several occasions, including statements published by the State
Council, respectively, in September 1987 and September 1988.
3.30     The Government's main objectives in the fertilizer sector are tc:
(a) achieve the desirable nutrient balance of 100(N): 5U (P205): 20 (K20) by
the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-95) by rapidly expanding the pro-
duction capacity for phosphate fertilizers based on domestic phosplhate rock
and the development of domestic potash resources; and (b) move toward self-
sufficiency in fertilizer production during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000). Other priorities include the rationalization of low-grade
fertilizer facilities through technical renovation, energy-saving measures and
improvement in product quality, and greater efficiency in enterprise
operations through improvements in management efficiency.
3.31     The Government's strategy for sectoral investment during the Seventh
Five-Year Plan envisages: (a) bringing on-line the newi fertilizer production
capacity currently under constraction (see para. 3.11); (b) converting medium-
size low-grade fertilizer plants to high-grade fertilizer proluction;
(c) intensifying the exploitation and development of d3mestic phosphate
resources, including seven large new phosphate mines and the expansion of
pyrite mining capacity; and (d) rationalization of many small-size low-grade
fertilizer plants, including their conversion to high-grade operations using
adaptive technologies.  At present, the Government does not contemplate any
investments in new small-size SSP or ABC plants.
3.32     During the Eigh-n and Ninth Five-Year Plans (1991-2000), Government
strategy will focus on further expanding phosphate fertilizer production capa-
city.  With the recent decentralization of project implementation responsi-
bilities, State resources will be used mainly for phosphate fertilizer; the
central Government will ntot initiate ary new nitrogenous fertilizer projects
and these will be implemented by the provincial authorities as necessary.
This strategy is considered appropriate, given the nutrient imbalance in fert-
ilizer use and China's endowment of phosphate rock.

IV. THE PHOSPHATE SUBSECTOR
A. World Phosphate Market
4.1      Consumption.  World phosphate fertilizer consumption grew steadily in
the 1970s and 1980s except in 1985/86, when a decline of 2.62 from Zhe pre-
vious year's consumption was registered. According to statistics published bv
FAO, world consumption of phosphate fertilizers rose from 19.8 million tons of
P205 to 34.3 million tons during 1969/70 to 1984/85, at an annual average rate
of 3.5Z. The decline in 1985/86 reflects the reduced application of ferti-
lizers in several countries exporting agricultural products due to the record-
low prices of grains and agricultural products in the international market.
In 1986/87, world phosphate consumption rsbounded to 34.4 million tons of
P205, largely due to a rapid increase in consumption in the developing coun-
tries.  The 1987/88 consumption is estimated at 36.4 million tons of P205, or
an increase of 5.82 from the previous year's consumption. World phosphate
consumption is projected by the Bank's International Economics Department to
increase at anL annual average rate of 2.7Z between 1987/88 and the year
2000/2001.  In 1986/87, the major consumers of phosphate fertilizers were the
USSR (24.3X of the world consumption), US (10.6Z), China (8.OZ), India (5.7z),
Brazil (4.9Z), and France (3.9%).
4.2      Production.  World production of phosphate fertilizers also grew
steadily, from 20.6 million tons of P205 in 1969/70 to 37.2 million tons in
1984/85. In response to the trends in demand for phosphate fertilizers, world
phosphate production fell to 34.6 million tons in 1985/86, and rebounded to
37.0 million toDs in 1986/87. In 1987/88, the world production level reached
an estimated peak of 38.3 million tons of P205. In 1986/87, the major
producers of phosphate fertilizers were the USSR (22.9% of world production),
US (22.0%), China (5.8%), India (4.62), Brazil (4.12), France (2.7Z), Tunisia
(1.92) and Morocco (1.3Z). According to supply projections by the
FAO/UNIDO/World Bank Fertilizer Working Group in May 1987, world phosphate
fertilizer supply potential, which is derived from world nominal capacity in
operation and under constrution and country-specific operation rates, was
estimated at 36.8 million tons of P205 in 1986/87, and was expected to reach
41.8 million tons by 1991/92, representing an annual average growth rate of
2.4Z. A major increase in capacity is expected to ,take place in developing
countries, particularly in Morocco, Tunisia, Jordan, China and Egypt where
major raw materials are abundant. The recent worldwide trend is to locate new
production facilities near phosphate rock mine sites.
4.3      International Trade and Market Prices.  The international phosphate
market is competitive; the two main exporting regions are North America and
Northern Africa and all other regions import. Phosphate fertilizer prices in
the world market, which fell sharply during the 1980-83 worldwide recession
and reached a record low in 1986, have increased steadily in recent years as
world demand particularly in developing countries recovered. While the world
market prices of phosphate fertilizers are not expected to increase
significantly in the short run given the forecast movement in the agricultural
market and the industry's investment behavior, the recovery of these prices is
expected to continue gradually and steadily throughout the 19909. Fertilizer



- 15 -
production facilities to be established under the Project are expected to come
on stream in early 1994.
B. The Chinese Phosphate Industry
4.4      Although the domestic production and use of phosphate fertilizers has
increased steadily over the last two decades, development of the phosphate
industry in China has been less spectacular than that of the nitrogen
industry. The main constraint has been technical difficulties in processing
Chinese rock, which has a high magnesium content, into concentrates suitable
for the production of high-grade fertilizers. Production of phosphate ferti-
lizer therefore has been limited to low-grade products such as SSP and CMP at
small provincial phosphate fertilizer plants. Accordingly, there was little
planning or coordination of the development of the phosphate fertilizer indus-
try at the state level. However, several years ago the Government shifted the
priority in the fertilizer .ector from nitrogenous to phosphate fertilizers,
in order to correct the large imbalance in fertilizer use.
4.5      Domestic Phosphate Fertilizer Production.  Recent trends in the pro-
duction of phosphate fertilizers are summarized in Table 4.A below (further
details are given in Annex 4.1). As of the end of 1987, almost all phosphate
fertilizer production was low-grade, with SSP comprising more than 70Z and CMP
most of the balance. Domestic production of other phosphate fertilizers has
been insignificant--in 1985, ammonium phosphate production was only 7,000 tons
of P205, while the total capacity of the phosphoric acid plants was only about
50,000 tpy of P205. About 400,000 tons of ground phosphate rock were also
being applied directly.

Source: MCI
4.6      There are about 700 phosphate fertilizer plants in China, scattered
among almost all the provinces (see Annex 4.2). The average output capacity



- 16 -
is 15,000-30,000 tpy, except for a few SSP plants that have capacities of more
than 100,000 tpy. Most of the production in each province is consumed within
its boundaries (Annex 4.3).
C. Supply of Raw Materials
4.7      The two main materials required for producing high-grade phosphate
fertilizers are phosphate rock and sulfuric acid.
4.8      Phosphate Rock.  China is well endowed with more than 3 billion tons
of phosphate rock (see Annex 4.4). The physical nature of the rock is similar
across deposits-- usually hard and with a high magnesium oxide (MgO) content
varying from about 2.5-6.0Z. Until recently, when a new process for benefici-
ating these rocks was developed in China, domestic rocks were not suitable for
producing high-grade phosphate fertilizers. Now, however, the Government is
planning several large new undertakings to exploit the major deposits of rock,
particularly in Hubei, Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces. The Project will support
several such efforts. Recent exploration also indicates large rock resources
in Sichuan Province.
4.9      Relative to the large size of the phosphate rock reserves, the cur-
rent level of production is low, for the reasons given above. Annual
production of phosphate rock in 1986 amounted to only 15 million tons of run
of mine (ROM) rock, mainly in five provinces, as shown in Table 4.B.  In 1986,
most of this rock was used as ROM rock; only about 5X was beneficiated before
use.

Source: MCI.
4.10     Because the phosphate fertilizer plants are small and scattered
throughout the country, phosphate rock is transported widely o-er China.
Yunnan Province, for example, sends rock to 24 provinces, Guizhou to 18, and
Hubei to 19. The major importing provinces are Hubei, Liaoning, Jiangsu,
Shandong and Guangxi. China imports a small quantity of rock (varying between
0.2 to 0.3 Mtpy from year to year) for some plants near the coast. It also
exports a small amount of phosphate rock under counter-trading arrangements
with other developing countries.
4.11     Sulfuric Acid.  China's sulfuric acid consumption in 1986 was about
7.6 million tons, of which about 5.0 million tons went for phosphate fertili-



- 17 -
zer production. China meets almost the entire demand for sulfuric acid domes-
tically. About 1.5 million tons of acid comes from smelter gas, and almost
all the remainder from pyrites; only a small amount comes from elemental
sulfur.
4.12     The major deposits and mines of pyrites are located in Guangdong,
Shanxi, Anhui, Liaoning, Hunan and Sichuan Provinces (Annex 4.5). The major
producers of smelter acid are in Liaoning, Gansu and Hunan. China has
discovered sulfur deposits in Shandong Province, but attempts to exploit them
have not been successful. Little sulfur is recovered from the oil and gas
industry as most gas deposits are sweet.
4.13     The shortage of sulfur could inhibit development of the phosphate
industry unless new deposits of pyrites or sources of by-product sulfuric acid
(e.g. phosphogypsum' are developed. GOC is avare of this possibility ancd. is
establishing a pilot plant in Yunnan to develop a process to recover sulfur
from phosphogypsum.
D. Th? Phosphate Subsector Study
4.14     As mentioned earlier (para. 1.1 and 1.4), during Project preparation
MCl and the World Bank carried out a joint Phosphate Subsector Study (the
Study) to help the Government identify appropriate strategies for developing
an efficient domestic phosphate fertilizer industry. The main objective of
the Study was to prepare an optimal investment program up to the year 2000
that would allow China to meet its rapidly growing demand for phosphate fer-
tilizers in the most economic wanner, given specified market requirements and
transport constraints.
4.15     The Phosphate Model.  As part of the Study, the Bank designed a
computer-based mathematical programming model to facilitate review of the
options, using data provided by MCI (see Annex 4.6 for the details). The
model covers optimization of investment at the national level as well as at
each plant in terms of location, scale of operations, and level of production
in the context of the constraints associated with the transport of raw mate-
rials, intermediates and final products. The selection of optimal strategies
was based on a comparison of different options and scenarios. The model
enabled the Government to review in a consistent and integrated manner the
major issues involved in developing the fertilizer industry, such as: (a)
domestic fertilizer production versus importation; (b) optimal mode of trans-
porting raw materials and finished products; (c) the location of new fert-
ilizer production facilities; (d) the relative economics of producing dif-
ferent types of phosphate fertilizers; and (e) priorities in developing the
different phosphate rock deposits. This model is being installed at MCI's
Chemical Planning Institute (CPI) with technical and financial assistance from
the Bank under the Phosphate Development Project (Loan 2958-CHA, FY88). It
will be continuously updated to provide advice to planning and project imple-
menting authorities on relevant subsector strategies.
4.16     The results of work with the model provided strong economic justifi-
cation for development of China's domestic phosphate fertilizer industry,
based on domestic raw materials. The analysis suggested that producing high-
grade phosphate fertilizers such as TSP, DAP and MAP near the rock sources in



- 18 -
Yunnan, Guizhou and Hubei Provinces can be more economic than relying on
imports. Construction of small DAP plants that use adaptive technology and
local raw materials also will help China meet its phosphate requirements.
E. Investment Program for the Phosphate Subsector
4.17     To meet its agricultural production targets by the year 2000 with
balanced use of the three main fertilizer nutrients, China will have to
increase its phosphate consumption to about 9.1 million tons of P205 from its
current level of 4.5 million tons. 'f most of the presently known economic
deposits are fully developed by that time, China could increase domestic pro-
duction from the 1986 level of 2.3 million tons of P205 to 9.0 million tons.
This development would necessitate an increase in phosphate rock production
from about 11 to 35 million tpy of rock and in sulfuric acid from about 8 to
more than 20 million tons. Total related investment costs for the production
facilities are estimated at about US$8-10 billion in 1988 prices, excluding
the large Investment required to upgrade the infrastructure to transport raw
materials to the processing units and to distribute the final products to the
marketplace.
4.18     During the Seventh Five-Year Plan, five large new phosphate rock
mines and many small local mines are to be developed (the Wengfu mine in
Guizhou, one mine in Yunnan, and three mines in Hubei). Output at the large
pyrites mines in Guangdong, Meimonggol, Hunan and Anhui will be greatly
increased to meet the demand for sulfuric acid. These local raw materials
will feed the new high-grade phosphate fertilizer plants to be implemented
during the Seventh and Eighth Five-Year Plan periods. Three DAP plants will
be implemented based on imported phosphoric acid. About 50 small SSP plants
will be revamped to produce DAP using adaptive technology, a move that will
allow them to utilize relatively low-grade phosphate rock. During the Eighth
and Ninth Five-Year Plans (1991-2000), the Government intends to fully expioit
the domestic phosphate resources to produce a total of 35 Mtpy of phosphate
rock (30Z P205 basis) and 9.0 Mtpy of phosphate fertilizers (10O P205) by the
year 2000. Details of specific investments in the phosphate subsector up to
the year 2000, estimated on the above basis, are given in Annex 4.7.
F. Bank Role and Project Justification
4.19     In support of the Government's efforts to implement its stracegies in
the fertilizer sector (paras. 3.28-3.31), the Bank's main role is to provide
technical and financial assistance in: (a) strengthening GOC's capability for
investment planning based on modern planning techniques, in order to optimize
investments in the sector, especially those for phosphate and potash fertili-
zer; (b) assessing specific projects using suitable methodologies, including
the selection of appropriate technologies; (c) building new fertilizer produc-
tion capacity, as well as renovating existing facilities, particularly for
phosphate and potash fertilizers; (d) enterprise-level restructuring and
upgrading the efficiency of fertilizer distribution so as to reduce fertilizer
losses during distribution; and (e) improving the managerial efficiency of
sector companies through the introduction of modern enterprise-level manage-
ment systems.



- 19 -
4.20     The two previous Bank-assisted nitrogenous fertilizer projects
supported China's priority objective during the early part of the Seventh
Five-Year Plan (1986-90), which has been given to improving the technical and
managerial efficiency of existing fertilizer plants. Most of the existing
large- and medium-size fertilizer plants, including the large ones built with
internationally proven technologies in the 1970s, do not use up-to-date tech-
nologies and require major investments to improve energy and production effi-
ciencies. The first project (Fertilizer Rehabilitation and Energy Saving
Project, Loan 2541-CHA, FY85), which was physically completed on schedule by
the end of 1988, provided financial assistance for improvements in efficiency
at one medium-size and four large nitrogenous fertilizer plants. The second
project (Fertilizer Rationalizaton Project, Loan 2838-CHA, FY87) provides
financial assistance both to upgrade the operations of five medium-size nitro-
genous fertilizer plants, including conversion of their products to high-grade
ones, and to introduce modern enterprise-level management systems in the fer-
tilizer industry overall. Implementation of th.a project is proceeding well
and on schedule. An IDA-financed technical credit also was provided to
support project preparation, including tests of the phosphate rock and feasi-
bility studies for the Project.
4.21     The Project, together with the third fertilizer project (the Phos-
phate Development Project, Loan 2958-CHA, FY88), supports China's priority in
the fertilizer sector during tine Seventh and Eighth Five-Year Plans (1986-95),
which is to reduce the nutrient imbalance in fertilizer use by rapidly expand-
ing the production capacity for high-grade phosphate products. At the same
time, the process of project preparation has provided an opportunity to intro-
duce modern subsector planning techniques and methodologies to the phosphate
industry and to help GOC articulate an optimal strategy for developing the
subsector. MCI's involvement in the joint phosphate subsector study has
strengthened its subsector planning capability. The experience and metho-
dologies learned from the Study also can be applied to other subsectors, a
process in which the Chinese Government has already expressed an interest. A
further innovation of this Project is the integrated development of phosphate
mines and high-grade fertilizer complexes, the largest and most complex of
such operations in China to date. This effort will provide China with the
experience needed to implement similar other investments, which already have
been identified in the Study. The technical assistance component is designed
to ensure successful Project implementation.
V. PROJECT INSTITUTIONS
5.1      The Hubei Phosphate Project involves:  (a) Jinxiang Phosphate Chemi-
cal Company (JPCC), Hubei Province, which will carry out the Dayukou mine and
fertilizer development component (paras. 6.3-6.4, 6.6); (b) Huangmailing Phos-
phate Chemical Company (HPCC), Hubei Province, which will carry out the Huang-
mailing mine and fertilizer development component (paras. 6.5-6.6); and (c)
MCI, which will coordinate Project execution by the Project companies and
implement the technical assistance component (paras. 6.7-6.10). The opera-
tional, managerial and organizational aspects of these institutions are
reviewed in this chapter, while the financial aspects are reviewed in Chapter
IX.



- 20 -
A. Background
5.2      Chinese chemical fertilizer companies and phosphate mines are state-
onmed but operate as financially and administratively independent entities.
In the past, the administrative, production, ma:ketiDg and financial opera-
tions of these companies were under the direct supervision of the provincial
governments. However, their autonomy in th'eir business decisions has been
expanding, and is expected to continue doiag so, under the ongoing economic
reforms. Large-size companies already enjoy wide autonomy in almost all
aspects of their operations. The project companies have been registered with
their respective provincial authorities to provide them with the status of
legal entities. Charters of the project companies describe the scope of their
activities, responsibilities and authority in the conduct of business.
5.3      Organization and Management.  The organization and management prac-
tices of Chinese state-owned industrial enterprises reveal strong similar-
ities. Their organization is basically flat--there are numerous unit work-
shops and departments with their own management layers, all at the same organ-
izational level. A general manager, appointed by the supervisory government,
heads each company. Under the general manager are the second-layer managers,
twho share functional responsibilities related to procurement and sales,
administration, production, maintenance and construction. A chief engineer,
also second-layer, is charged with all technical matters, including develop-
ment and renovation. A chief accountant has a similar position in the area of
financial matters.
5.4      This structure has not promoted contemporary standards of organiza-
tional and managerial efficiency, such as adequate scope of control,
functional distribution of responsibilities among line managers, and adequate
managerial and financial autonomy. The Government (SPC, MCI and the local
Governments) has been setting annual production targets, allocating inputs,
distributing output, and allocating funds from budgets. Some managers, parti-
cularly those responsible for production, have been overloaded with super-
visory responsibilities. Horizontal coordination among various departments
and workshops is not satisfactory. Because of insufficient autonomy, good
management information and cost management systems do not exist.
5.5      Recent Management Reforms.  Under the recent economic reforms,
Chinese fertilizer companies have received increasing management autonomy.
One result, however, is that there is now a two-tier planning and management
system. The state plan mandates a basic minimum level of activity, but beyond
that level each company is free to operate in response to market forces under
its own flexible plan. Companies can make their own decisions regarding pro-
duction levels, procurement of raw materials, sales of products above the
quota, and utilization of funds generated by those sales, within the context
of the flexible plan. Although state planning for the fertilizer sector is
expected to continue in the near future, the scope for flexible planning and
management is to expand further, providing greater autonomy to management.
5.6      MCI recognizes the strong need to restructure the organization and
management of the chemical fertilizer companies so that they can effectively
carry out their mandates for organizational change. This reatructuring can be



- 21 -
done tiirough the introduction of modern enterprise-level management systems
for infomnation and costs, as well as investment and financial planning. MCI,
with Bank assistance under the Fertilizer Rationalization Project (Loan
2838-CHA, FY87), is sponsoring a management efficiency study, using
internationally experienced consultants. The aim of the study is to raise
managerial efficiency in fertilizer companies in the context of the changing
business environment. The study is expected to be completed by the end of
1989. It also will provide practical recommendations for introducing suitable
modern systems. MCI plans to introduce these systems gradually in the entire
chemical industry, including the project companies, following successful
introduction of them at several companies on a pilot basis. The Beijing
Institute of Chemical Engineering and Management (BICEM), MCI's management
training arm for engineers and managers of chemical enterprises as well as
MCI's own staff, is currently implementing a comprehensive program to upgrade
its management training capabilities with Bank assistance under the same
project.
B.  The Jinxiang Phosphate Chemic'l Company (JPCC)
5.7      Background.  JPCC is the new name of the JinxiRng Mining Bureau
(JMB), which has been operating since 1958 at Huji City, about 400 km north-
west of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province. Presently, JPCC operates three
phosphate rock mines: (a) the Dayukou open-pit mine, with a capacity of 0.4
million tpy; (b) the Liuchong underground mine, with a capacity of 0.6 million
tpy; and (c) the Wangji underground mine, the first phase of which was com-
pleted in 1985 and which is currently being expanded to its final capacity of
1.5 million tpy. The rock of Dayukou and Liuchong is currently being sold as
feedstock without beneficiation to low-grade phosphate fertilizer plants,
mainly in Hubei Province. The total output of the Wangji mine will be bene-
ficiated at the company's Wangji beneficiation plant, which was completed in
1986. Phosphate rock concentrate from Wangji will be sold to the Lucheng
nitrophosphate plant in Shanxi Province.
5.8      Production Performance.  Except in 1987, when they were faced with
difficulties in marketing low-grade rock, Dayukou and Liuchong mines have
operated at relatively high levels of capacity utilizaton (around 92-99%) (see
Annex 5.1 for details). The new Wangji mine and beneficiation plant, the
physical construction of which was completed in mid-1987, started up only in
mid-1988 because of delays in completing the downstream Lucheng fertilizer
plant. The existing Dayukou mine has suffered from defective design, mainly
in terms of undersized and poorly adapted main mining equipment. Expansion of
the Dayukou mine under the Project is intended to eliminate the above defects
through the selection of well-adapted equipment.
5.9      Organization and Management.  JPCC is headed by a general manager who
is appointed by the Hubei provincial government. The general manager is
assisted by six second-layer managers: (a) the chief engineer; (b) the
director for production; (c) the director for administration: (d) the chief
economist; (e) the chief accountant; and (f) the legal advisor. No major
changes in JPCC's organizational structure are currently envisaged after
project completion, except as a result of the expansion of the Dayukou mine
and fertilizer complex (see Annex 5.2). Management already has gained valu-
able experience in constructing a large-scale mine and a beneficiation plant
from the new and complex Wangji iacility. However, the addition of the new



- 22 -
large mine and a modern complex fertilizer production operation will require
managerial strengthening, including the recruitment of qualified second- and
third-layer managers.
5.10     Staffing and Training.  JPCC's staff presently number 10,170, of whom
3,220 have higher educations and 690 are engineers and managers. After
completion of the Project, JPCC will have 12,670 staff, including 1,100 engi-
neers. In addition to strengthening managerial capability, recruiting addi-
tional experienced technical staff also is required. During loan negotia-
tions, an assurance was obtained that JPCC would prepare, and furnish to the
Bank for comment by December 31, 1990, a comprehensive program to strengthen
management, recruit qualified staff, and provide training, and thereafter will
carry out the agreed program. JPCC will obtain assistance from internation-
ally experienced consultants and local design institutes in preparing the
program.
C. The Huangmailing Phosphate Chemical Company (HPCC)
5.11     Background.  HPCC will be created by merging two companies-
-Huangmailing Mining Company (HMC) located at Huangmailing, about 160 km north
of Wluhan, the capital of Hubei Province, and the Dawu ABC plant, located 15 km
from the Huangmailing mine. This merger is intended to facilitate the con-
struction and operation of the TSP complex to be established under the Project
by putting the core facilities of the complex under one management. HMC,
founded in 1973, currently operates an open-pit mine with a design capacity of
300,000 tpy of ROM ore, an adjacent rock beneficiation plant of the same capa-
city, and an SSP plant of 40,000 tpy capacity, together with a small pyrites-
based sulfuric acid plant of 15,000 tpy capacity and a recently added small
(10,000 tpy) bulk blending facility that produces N-P-K fertilizers. The Dawu
ABC plant, with a capacity of 15,000 tpy of ammonia and 51,000 tpy of ABC, was
established in the early 1970s.
5.12     Production Performance.  HMC's output of beneficiated rock has been
substantially below design capacity in recent years (see Annex 5.1), mainly
because of a delay in the construction of downstream high-grade fetilizer
plants. The small scale low-grade phosphate fertilizer plants have been
operating at relatively high capacities because of the general shortage of
phosphate fertilizers in the locality despite the gradual shift toward high-
grade phosphate fertilizers. Integration of the new mine and the proposed
Huangmailing MAP plant will help HPCC solve the problem of timing mismatch of
upstream and downstream facilities, since all the rock concentrate produced by
the existing beneficiation plant will be consumed by the MAP plant.
5.13     Organization and Management.  HPCC will be headed by a general
manager, assisted by four directors responsible for: (a) operations; (b)
production; (c) personnel; and (d) administraticn. Some streamlining of
HPCC's organizational structure after project completion is being considered
to accommodate the major expansion of operations under the Project (see Annex
5.3 for details). As HPCC's existing operations are of simple design, its
managers have not been exposed to the requirements of modern, complex facili-
ties. Significant reinforcement of HPCC's management will be required to
ensure successful implementation and completion of the Project.



- 23 -
5.14     Staffing and Training.  HPCC staff presently number 905, of whom 60
are engineers and managers. After completion of the Project, total staff are
expected to increase to 1,750 and engineers to 120. Considering the inexper-
ience of management and the low level of technical skills within the company,
considerable external recruitment and intensive training will be required.
During loan negotiations, HPCC provided the same commitment as that obtained
from JPCC with respect to management strengthening, and staff recruitment and
training (para. 5.10).
D. The Ministry of Chemical Industry (MCI)
5.15     Background.  The Ministry of Chemical Induetry (MCI) has national
supervisory responsibility for the chemical fertilizer sector, including phos-
phate mining, and a number of refineries, rubber plants and several other
chemical industries. MCI prepares the five-year plans for these subsectors,
works out annual production targets, coordinates the supply of raw materials
and sales of output, and monitors the activities of the chemical industry at
the provincial and county levels in coordination with the Chemical Industry
Bureaus of local governments. MCI also coordinates the implementation of
large-scale investment projects in the chemical sector which are supported
financially and managed by the national government agencies under the national
investment plans.
5.16     Organization and Management.  MCI is headed by a minister, who is
assisted by four deputy ministers responsible for respectivelys (a) finance
and foreign affairs; (b) production; (c) construction projects; and (d) educa-
tion and research. MCI maintains a task force known as the "World Bank
Project Implementation Coordination Group" to coordinate with the Bank. It is
headed by the deputy minister for finance and foreign affairs. The World Bank
Loan Office, an executive arrr of the group headed by a director-level
official, maintains project coordination groups for Bank-supported projects,
including this Project.
VI. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
6.1      The specific objectives of the Project are to:  (a) provide financial
and technical assistance in implementing some of the first major projects of
the investment program developed from the Phosphate Subsector Study undertaken
during Project preparation (paras. 1.1, 1.4 and 4.14)--these projects would
provide models for integrated development of phosphate mines and fertilizer
plants; and (b) strengthen MCI's project management capabilities, particularly
with respect to reducing technical risks associated with the integrated devel-
opment of large-scale phosphate mines and high-grade fertilizer complexes.
6.2      To achieve the objectives, the Project comprises three major com-
ponents: (a) Dayukou phosphate mine and fertilizer pruduction development
component; (b) Huangmailing phosphate mine and fertilizer production develop-
ment component; and (c) technical assistance component.



- 24 -
B. Dayukou Phosphate Mine and Fertilizer Development Component
6.3      This component, which will be carried out by JPCC, involves estab-
lishment of: (a) a new open-pit mine of 1.5 million tpy ROM rock capacity, to
replace the existing ineffLcient Dayukou mine; (b) a beneficiation plant, to
produce 0.65 million tp, of phosphate rock concentrate (33Z P205); (c) a
560,000 tpy TSP plant, together with a pyrites-based sulfuric acid plant of
560,000 tpy capacity and a phosphoric acid plant of 200,000 tpy P205 capacity;
(d) a 12,000 tpy aluminum fluoride plant; and (e) related infrastructure (see
Annex 6.1 for details). After commissioning the new Dayukou mine and benefi-
ciation plant, the existing Dayukou and Liuchong mines will be phased out.
The mine and beneficiation plant have been designed by the China Chemical
Mines Research and Design Institute (CMRDI), with assistance from Jacobs
Engineering, a US company, and the fertilizer plant by Nanjing Chemical Design
Institute (NUDI), with guidance from Chemsystems, also a US company.
6.4      Because Dayukou rock alone is not suitable for the production of TSP,
mainly due to its high magnesium content, about 220,000 tpy of phosphate con-
centrate with good reactivity will be supplied from Yunnan Province by rail.
During loan negotiations, an assurance was obtained from JPCC that it would
prepare supply and transport arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the
required quantity of this concentrate by December 31, 1991.
C. Huangmailing Phosphate Mine and Fertilizer Development Component
6.5      This component, which will be carried out by HPCC, involves the
establishment of: (a) a new open-pit mine of 1.0 million tpy ROM rock capa-
city, to replace the existing mine; fb) a beneficiation plant to produce
240,000 tpy of phosphate rock concentrate (332 P205); (c) an MAP plant of
180,000 tpy capacity, together with a pyrites-based sulfuric acid plant of
280,000 tpy capacity and a phosphoric acid plant of 93,000 tpy P205 capacity;
and (d) rehabilitation of a small coal-based ABC plant at Dawu, about 15 km
from the project site, to produce 30,000 tpy of ammonia as feedstock for MAP
production (see Annex 6.2 for details). After commissioning the new complex,
HPCC's existing small SSP and NPK facilities will be phased out, and the
existing beneficiation plant will be operated to complement the new benefici-
ation plant. Raw materials and products will be transported by truck between
Huangmailing and a new railway siding to be built at Guangshui, about 40 km
from the Project site. The mine and the beneficiation plant were designed by
the China Chemical Mines Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI), the fertilizer
plant by lWuhan Chemical Engineering Design Institute (WCEDI).
6.6      When the above two components are completed, the production of phos-
phate fertilizer in Hubei Province will reach 450,000 tpy of P205, of which
350,000 tpy, or about 782, are expected to be consumed within Hubei. The
balance will be marketed in adjoining provinces, which are generally short of
phosphate fertilizers, particularly high-grade products.
D. Technical Assistance Component
6.7      The technical assistance component, to be carried out by MCI, has two
components: (a) the services of internationally experienced consultants for
MCI's project coordination team to support project implementation, process and



- 25 -
technology selection, production start-up, and the maintenance of mine equip-
ment; and (b) the services of internationally experienced consultants for
local training in hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis with respect to
chemical plant design and operations.
6.8      Consultant Services for Project Implementation.  The Project involves
risks associated with the coordinated implementation and commissioning of
high-grade phosphate fertilizer plants and associated mines. As mentioned in
paras. 5.8 and 5.12, JPCC's new Wangji mine and I)eneficiation plant remained
idle for one year after their physical completion, and HPCC's mines have been
underutilized mai-:ly due to delays in the completion of downstream fertilizer
plants.
6.9      To mitigate these technical risks, this technical assistance compo-
nent will provide internationally experienced consultants for MCI's project
coordination team, who will help the team and the project companies withs (a)
selection and procurement of appropriate technologies and equipment; (b)
timely identification and resolution of problems with project implementation;
(c) training of project management team staff; (d) preparation of staff
recruitment and training programs; and (e) implementation of a preventive mine
workshop maintenance system. The scope of their work was discussed during
project preparation, and the terms of reference (see Annex 6.3 for summary)
will be finalized during loan negotiations.
6.10     Training in Hazard and OperabilitZ Analysis.  To strengthen the capa-
city of Chinese design institutes to identify and analyze potential safety
hazards in chemical plant design and operations and plant operability, MCI
will sponsor a workshop on modern methodologies for Hazard and Operability
(HAZOP) analysis, with assistance from internationally experienced consultants
(see Annex 6.4 for details).
VII. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
A. Engineering Arrangements
7.1      Local design institutes will handle most of the basic and detailed
engineering for the Project. The two local design institutes that prepared
the feasibility studies, CMRDI for Dayukou and CMPDI for Huangmailing, will
carry out the detailed engineering for the mines, beneficiation plants, and
infrastructure. These two design institutes have extensive experience in the
design, engineeLing, construction and start-up of comparable mines and benefi-
ciation plants. Overall responsibility for the basic and detailed engineering
for the fertilizer plants also will lie with local design institutes--NCDI for
the TSP complex at Dayukou, and WCEDI for the MAP complex at Huangmailing.
7.2      However, these institutes will not handle any facilities for which
they do not have sufficient experience and capability, namely, the sulfuric
acid, phosphoric acid, and granulation plants. Internationally experienced
engineering firms will be invited to provide the design and know-how for those
plants. Although NCDI has had considerable experience in designing of Sul-
furic acid, phosphoric acid and DAP plants, including a DAP plant in Yunnan



- 26 -
supported under the ongoing Bank-financed Fertilizer Rationalization Project
(Loan 2838-CRA, FY87), it has not been involved with plants of a size compar-
able to the Dayukou project. The services to be obtained from the interna-
tionally experienced engineering firms will include assistance in the procure-
ment of critical equipment to ensure efficient selection and adequate quality
control during manufacturing and prior to shipment. These firms will use
technologies that are commercially proven and acceptable in terms of invest-
ment, operating costs, efficiency, safety and environmental aspects, and will
provide process guarantees. They will involve local design institutes as much
as possible feasible for technology transfer.
7.3      Local input in the design of the fertilizer plant at Huangmailing is
expected to be larger than that for Dayukou, as the scope of the former is
compatible with locally available and commercially proven experience. The
local design institutes will conduct hazard and operability studies on all
critical processes, in collaboration with specialists. The respective local
design institutes will also provide guarantees on processes designed locally.
B. Project Management
7.4      The arrangements for overall Project coordination are similar to
those under the three ongoing Bank-financed fertilizer projects, where they
have proven satisfactory. MCI will have primary responsibility for supervis-
ing implementation of all Project components and for coordinating the con-
struction work with raw materials supply and downstream plants. The project
coordination group set up within MCI (Annex 7.1) will regularly review prog-
ress on project implementation and procurement and coordinate efforts to
remove any constraints. The coordination group also will maintain liaison
with the companies and the Bank, submitting to the latter quarterly financial
and technical progress reports. During negotiations, an assurance was
obtained from the Government that the group would be maintained during project
implementation.
7.5      Each of the two project companies has already set up its own project
management team (Annex 7.2) charged with implementing its respective compo-
nent. The key staff responsible for specific aspects of project implementa-
tion have been appointed. JPCC, which has just completed the major Wangji
mine and infrastructure project, is well prepared to carry out the Dayukou
component. Because HPCC has limited experience in managing projects of com-
parable magnitude, its project management team will receive substantial
support from CMRDI, which has experience in large mine and chemical projects
in China. Internationally experienced consultants to be hired by MCI under
the technical assistance component will also provide assistance (see para
6.9). During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the companies that
they would maintain their project management teams during project implementa-
tion.
C. Implementation Schedule
7.6      Implementation of the Project is expected to take 54 months from the
start of the selection process, which is scheduled to take place in the fourth
quarter of 1989. Construction under the two development components is
expected to be complete by March 1994. The mines and the beneficiation plants



- 27 -
will be finished before the fertilizer plants so that they can build up the
necessary intermediate stocks. The overall project is scheduled for comple-
tion by September 30, 1994. The project implementation schedule, along with
key milestones for project implementation, is shown in Annex 7.3. In light of
experience with previous Bank-financed fertilizer projects, the project sche-
dule is reasonable.
D. Trainina
7.7      Substantial training is required for the companies to ensure success-
ful project implementation. JPCC has some experience in implementing and
running large mine operations, as noted. HPCC has experience with smaller
mines and fertilizer plants. However, their skills and experience still do
not conform to what is required to ensure smooth start-up and operations.
7.8      MCI and the project companies are well aware of the need for
training. Each company will prepare a comprehensive recruitment and training
program, with assistance from internationally experienced consultants and
local design institutes, and will implement it (paras. 5.10 and 5.14). The
training program will include early assignment of managers and key technical
staff to their positions during project implementation but prior to start-up
so that they can learn from the consultants, licensors and engineering firms.
The program also allows for overseas training in new technologies for open-pit
mining, beneficiation, medium/large capacity sulfuric acid production, and
phosphoric acid/MAP/TSP manufacture. On-the-job training in the operation of
high-grade fertilizer plants will be provided at existing Chinese sulfuric
acid plants and new phosphoric acid and DAP plants under construction. Over
the next two years, the design institutes will focus on training for key tech-
nical staff and company trainers. MCI plans to make arrangements for inten-
sive training of key managers of both companies at BICEM (see para. 5.6)
before the production start-up.
E. Environmental Aspects
7.9      All the mines and chemical plants under the Project will be designed
and constructed to meet locally and internationally acceptable environmental
standards. The internationally experienced consultants involved in Project
preparation have paid particular attention to appropriate emission levels at
the two phosphate fertilizer plants to ensure satisfactory process controls.
The s4tes and configurations of the open-pit mines, beneficiation plants and
fertilizer plants were selected to ensure the least environmental impact. For
example, all mining operations are concentrated in one large open pit at each
Project site; beneficiation tailing ponds and phosphogypsum storage areas will
be designed to avoid any groundwater pollution; and water treatment plants
will be installed to process all liquid effluent from the beneficiation and
fertilizer plants prior to discharge into public waters (the majority of
liquid effluents and process water from the processing units will be treated
and recirculated into the processes). Air pollution will be kept within
international standards. The expected emission levels from each plant are
compared to local and international standards in Annex 7.4.
7.10     Assurances have been obtained from the two companies that they will
build and operate the Project mines and plants with due regard to safety and



- 28 -
ecological and environmental factors and will comply with environmental stan-
dards satisfactory to the Bank.
VIII. CAPITAL COSTS, FINANCING PLAN, PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT
A. Capital Cost Estimates
8.1       The total financing required for the Project, including interest
during construction (IDC) and incremental working capital, ic estimated at
US$510.6 million equivalent, of which US$162.3 million, or 31.8%, is in
foreign exchange. The estimate includes all off-site facilities necessary for
the Project, such as water and power supply, facilities for transport, storage
and handling of raw materials, intermediates and products, and social infra-
structure. The capital cost estimates (detailed in Annex 8.1) are summarized
in Table 8.A.

8.2      The base cost estimates, expressed in January 1989 prices, were
derived from estimates prepared by the Project authorities and MCI in collab-
oration with the domestic design institutes, after checking with internation-
ally experienced engineering firms. Physical contingencies are calculated at
1OZ of the base cost estimates. In calculating the base cost and physical
contingencies, the prevailing exchange rate of Y 3.72 to US$1 was used. The
price escalation for foreign costs was calculated on the basis of anticipated
annual international price movements of 5.32 for 1989-90 and 4.1 thereafter.
Price escalation for costs expressed in local currency was calculated based on
projected annual local inflation rates of 15.OZ for 1989, 10.0% for 1990-91
and 8.0% thereafter. Equipment and materials imported for the Project are
exempt from import duties. The local companies will pay sales tax on locally
procured equipment and materials.
B. Financing Plan
8.3      The proposed Bank loan of US$137.0 million will meet 84.5% of the
total foreign exchange and 26.8% of the total financing required. The remain-
ing financing will be met mainly by loans arranged by GOC (47.2%), loans
arranged by the Hubei provincial -.overnment (HPG) (20.7Z), internal funds of
the companies (3.7?), loans from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC) (1.6%), and bilateral aid (0.1%). The proposed financing plan for the
Project is summarized in Table 8.B.

8.4      IBRD Loan Financing.  The proposed Bank loan will be made available
to GOC at the Bank's standard rate of interest for 20 years, including 5 years
of grace, with a commitment charge of 0.75Z. The total amount of the loan
will be on-lent by GOC, through HPG, to the two companies at an on-lending
rate equal to 1052 of the Bank variable loan rate, with a commitment charge of
0.752 and a repayment period of 20 years, including 5 years of grace as
follows: (a) JPCC, US$94.15 million; and (b) HPCC, US$42.85 million. An
amount of US$300,000 to cover consultant services for project implementation
to be provided under the technical assistance component will be equally shared
by the two companies, and the loan amount for each company includes one half
of this amount. The foreign exchange risk will be passed on to the companies.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that subsi-
diary loan agreements would be signed by GOC and HPG, and HPG and the
companies on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank as a condition of
loan effectiveness. HPG will provide a foreign exchange denominated loan of
US$2.3 million to cover some minor imported items, and the terms of the loan
will be the same as the on-lending terms of the Bank loan. An additional
foreign exchange requirement of US$22.9 million equivalent to cover interest
during construction (IDC) on the Bank loan will be covered by a local currency
loan to be arranged by HPG, and the required foreign exchange will be made
available from GOC's and HPG's own foreign exchange reserves.
8.5      Local Financing.  GOC, through the People's Construction Bank of
China (PCBC), will provide construction loans to cover 69Z of the local
financing requirements for fixed assets at its prevailing rate for similar
investments (currently 3.6Z p.a.), with a maturity of 15 years, including a
grace period equal to the construction period as follows: (a) JPCC, Y 710.1
million (US$159.6 million); and (b) HPCC, Y 359.9 million (US$81.1 million).
HPG, through the provincial branch of PCBC, will provide the balance of the
local financing requirements for fixed assets on the same terms; (a) JPCC,
Y 322.2 million (US$72.7 million) and (b) HPCC, Y 128.1 million (US$30.6 mil-
lion). Portions of the loans arranged by HPG will be used to cover IDC on the
proposed Bank loan (para 8.4). Interest payments on these loans w'.ll be
deferred during the construction period and repaid in installments after
completion of the Project. The remaining local financing needs, including
incremental working capital, will be met either by internal funds or short
term loans from local banks. Financial projections indicate that both project
companies will need short-term loans from local banks to cover a portion of
their incremental working capital requirements. During negotiations, confir-
mation was obtained from the Government on all necessary arrangements for
providing local funds to finance the local costs of the Project.

8.7      A major portion of the equipment and materials (752 of those financed
by the Bank loan) will be procured through international competitive bidding
(ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines. Standard bidding documents to be
applied to all Chinese projects are currently being prepared to improve pro-
curement efficiency in ICB. In ICB, domestic manufacturers will be given a
margin of 152 or the prevailing customs duty, whichever is lower, for purposes
of bid evaluation. International engineering and technical assistance
services will be selected according to Bank guidelines for the use of consult-
ants.
8.8      Specialized items with only a limited number of suppliers, such as
agitators for the phosphoric acid reactor and gypsum filters, will be procured
through limited international bidding (LIB). Items for LIB are expected not
to exceed US$22.0 million in aggregate. All qualified bidders would be
invited under LIB.
8.9      Orders for small or miscellaneous items with an estimated value of up
to US$200,000 each will be procured through international shopping from at
least three qualified and eligible suppliers, up to an aggregate amount of
US$5.7 million. No procurement through direct contracting is envisaged.



- 33 -
8.10     Packages with an estimated value of US$1.0 million or more, expected
to number about 20, would be subject to prior Bank review; packages below
US$1.0 million each would be subject to post-review by the Bank. Contracts
with consultants will be subject to Bank approval prior to signature. Inter-
national procurement will be executed by the China National Chemical Con-
struction Corporation (CNCCC),5/ in cooperation with MCI's Project
coordination group. To avoid delays in Project execution, the Bank loan will
retroactively finance up to US$2.0 million of eligible expenditures for
downpayments for engineering contracts and technical services and
international travel, incurred between February 5, 1989 and the date of loan
signing.
8.11     Procurewent Arrangements for Local Financing.  Local procurement will
be carried out by the respective operating companies with assistance from the
design institutes. Since SPC identifies the Project as a key national
project, the supply of major local construction materials, plant and equipment
(about 90% of the total items required) is regulated by an allocation system
administered by central and provincial government agencies. Applications for
annual requirements have to be made in advance to SPC and the State Materials
Supply Bureau. However, under recent provisions, buyers and suppliers of
equipment have seme scope for negotiation as to the type of equipment,
delivery and price.
8.12     Most of the civil works, construction, a major part of the
engineering work, and some equipment and materials will be procured locally.
Contracts for civil works and ccnstruction will be awarded through assignment
to specialized construction bureaus or companies under negotiated contracts
that specify unit costs, terms of payment and incentives/penalties for
early/late completion or delivery. The capabilities of local contractors
proposed for the Project are satisfactory for timely and efficient execution
of the proposed work.
D. Allocation and Disbursement of the Bank Loan
8.13     The proposed allocation of the Bank loan is summarized in Table 8.D.

ally manufactured goods, and 75? of local expenditures for items procured
locally; (b) 100? of the expenditures for licenses, engineering and technical
services for Project management; and (c) 100? of the cost for overseas travel
b7 local staff for engineering, procurement and tzaining. To facilitate the
disbursement of funds, a special account will be established in US dollars at
a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank, with an authorized allocation of
US$10.0 million. Disbursement will be against full documentation except for
training, overseas travel and contracts valued at less than US$200,000 equiva-
lent each, which would be against statements of expenditure. Documentation of
statements of expenditure will be maintained by MCI's project coordination
group, to be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank,
and to be made available for review by the Bank during Project supervision.
8.14     The Project completion date would be September 30, 1994; the closing
date is expected to be March 31, 1995. An estimated disbursement schedule for
the Project has been prepared based on Bank experience with previous com-
parable projects in China; it is generally in line with the Bank's recommended
standard disbursement profile for industrial projects in Asia Region. It is
given in Annex 8.2.

IX. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Financial Management Practices in China
9.1      Financial Autonomy.  In the past, the Government made all major fin-
ancial decisions, including approval of new investments.  Enterprises remitted
almost all internally generated funds to the Government, and funds for new
investments were, in turn, provided as grants through budget allocations.
Recent reforms have resulted in greater financial autonomy and accountability
for the managers of individual enterprises. Major changes include: (a)
enterprises can retain 100Z of their depreciation allowances; (b) enterprises
can retain an increasing portion of their profits (this provision varies
across companies and provinces); (c) new funding requirements, including those
for investments, are to be met out of a company's internally retained funds or
interest-bearing loans (long-term capital construction loans for fixed invest-
ments and short-term borrowing for working capital); and (d) enterprises may
utilize an increasing portion of internally retained funds without prior gov-
eranent approval. Given the increasing financial autonomy and accountability
of companies, there is a growing need and opportunity for these enterprises to
engage in longer term financial planning and to improve on the traditional
concentration on one-year financial targets.
9.2      Financing of New Projects.  The recent economic reforms have also
changed dramatically the Government's policy on financing new investments. In
the past, all new investments were, as noted, financed through budget alloca-
tions in the form of grants. Recently, the Government introduced the concept
of interest-bearing loans as an incentive for industrial enterprises to econo-
mize on the use of funds. While this was, in principle, a positive step, it
has been carried to the point that new government-financed investments for
state-owned enterprises must now be financed entirely through debt. As a
result, newly formed companies are entirely debt-based, a financial structure
that conflicts with the basic norm for prudent financial management and
accountability. In particular, many companies have been facing cash flow
difficulties during the initial years of operations because of their excessive
debt service burden, and they have had to enter into negotiations with respect
to financing and bail-outs on a case-by-case basis. While the companies'
existence has not been threatened because of the country's structure of state
ownership, this situation undermines the autonomy of the enterprises and con-
flicts with the basic thrust of China's economic reform, which is designed to
place greater responsibility on enterprise management.
9.3      The Government recognizes the need to allow for equity-type funding
and is currently moving toward the creation of instruments for such financing.
However, it will take time for the new instruments of financing to develop
sufficiently to allow for large-scale equity financing, particularly in light
of the current ambiguities relating to enterprise ownership.
9.4      Financial Accounting and Audits.  The Chinese accounting system is
governed by several regulations issued by central and local governments.
Special features of the system include: (a) maintenance of two separate
accounts--one for production operations, the other for construction projects--
that are not consolidated; (b) the inclusion of interest charges in the
production costs, so that operating income reflects the company's financial



- 36 -
structure; and (c) the matching of funding sources with specific types of
assets--fixed assets with fixed funds, current assets with current funds, and
special assets with special funds.6/ The financial statements of Chinese
enterpr'ses are subject to external audits by the State Audit Administration
(SAM), which was established in 1983 to ensure efficient and prudent financial
management bv enterprises. The Bank has been supporting the Government's
efforts t3 improve its audit capability through training under a Technical
Cooperation Credit (Cr. 1412-CHA).
B. Financial Performance and Prolections
9.5      The financial projections for Project entities were carried out using
current yuan. It was conservatively assumed (the key assumptions are detailed
in Annex 9.1) that their output prices would be lower by 10-20Z than their
projected CIF import prices. Their actual prices are expected to be deter-
mined at levels close to import parity, since GOC would allow the entire out-
put of the project companies to be sold at negotiated prices (para. 3.26); the
current ceiling for negotiated prices of high-grade phosphate fertilizers
(DAP) is 98Z of its import parity price (para. 3.24). The real prices of
inputs and outputs (i.e., after allowing for inflation) were assumed to remain
unchanged at their January 1988 levels over the life of the Project. Detailed
historical and projected financial data, prepared in accordance with conven-
tional accounting concepts adjusted for the Chinese accounting system, are
given in Anrexes 9.2-9.3. The salient features of financial performan ' and
the projected future finances of the companies are shown in Table 9.A.
6/ Strict application of earmarking, or non-fungibility, is gradually
being relaxed, as enterprises retain greater portions of their
internally generated funds as special funds.

9.6             Financial Performance.  JPCC and HPCC have virtually no debt as a
result of the Government's earlier policy of financing state-owned enterprises
by providing investment and working capital as grants through budget alloca-
tions. Both companies remained relatively stable in terms of production and
finances over the past five years, despite the general decline in demand in
China for low-grade phosphate rocks and fertilizers, because their local
markets were less affected by imported high-grade fertilizers. While JPCC's
sales revenue and net profits dropped significantly in 1987, this was mainly
because of the low utilization of the new Wangji mine and the delayed start-up
of the Wangji beneficiation plant. Since the commissioning of the Wangji
plant in mid 1988, JPCC's financial performance improved in 1988, and is
expected to improve further as the plant achieves its full capacity from 1989
onwards. HPCC, which operates outdated, inefficient facilities, has



- 38 -
experienced low and declining profit margins, again mainly because of the
declining demand and prices for low-grade fertilizer (paras. 5.8 and 5.12).
9.7      Financial Projections.  Both companies are expected to achieve satis-
factory profits, and their net profit margins on sales revenue will remain
relatively high at over 252--once their operations reach full capacity. In
1994, the first year of operations, JPCC and HPCC are expected to achieve only
marginal net profits because of low capacity utilization, a normal experience
for new mines and fertilizer plants. With the build-up of capacity, the
combined net profits of the two companies are expected to increase from Y 89.5
million in 1994, to Y 227.0 million in 1995, and Y 388.1 million in 1996.
9.8      The two companies nre not expected to have any serious cash flow
difficulties, and will generate sufficient cash internally to cover cash
expenditures. However, HPCC will not show a comfortable debt service ratio in
its first year of operations. Because of the Government's current funding
policy (para. 9.2), HPCC, which does not have a significant capital base, will
also have high financial leverage until it accumulates retained earnings from
operations. Given this background, the Government intends to take action to
allow the companies to achieve sound financial positions rapidly in the event
that it changes the funding policy, and a specific financial covenant has been
designed to ensure that the companies will be able to cope with potential
cashflow difficulties during their start-up years (para. 9.10).
C. Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
9.9      The cost and revenue streams for the incremental financial rate of
return (FRR), expressed in January 1989 yuan, are presented in Annex 9.4. The
estimated base case FRRs (before taxes) for the companies are: 14.2Z for the
Dayukou component, and 13.1Z for the Huangmailing component. The FRRs for the
companies are lower than their respective economic rates of return (ERRs),
mainly because the assumed financial prices for fertilizers are below their
economic value. The results of the sensitivity tests are shown in Table 9.B.

The FRRs for the Project are sensitive to changes in, in descending order,
sales revenue, capital cost, and variable costs (input prices). Given that
adverse changes in the variables by a margin of 202 are not likely, satisfac-
tory levels of FRR are likely to be realized.
D. Financial Covenants
9.10     During negotiations, agreement was reached that the companies would:
(a) maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 and not incur any
long-term debt unless their projected internal cash retention for each fiscal
year during the term of the debt exceeds 1.2 times their projected debt ser-
vice requirements in that year; (b) maintain a long-term debt/equity ratio of
75:25 or better; and (c) maintain a current ratio of 1.2 or better, once such
covenanted ratios are reached. Because of the current government financing
practice with respect to new investments (para. 9.2), HPCC will not be able to
achieve these covenanted ratios in the initial years of operations, particu-
larly the debt/equity ratio, until it builds up capacity utilization and
retained earnings. The timeframe for achieving these ratios is as follows:
debt service coverage ratio--1994 for JPCC and HPCC; long-term debt to equity
ratio--1994 for JPCC, and 1996 for HPCC; current ratio--1994 for JPCC, and
1995 for HPCC. Therefore, an additional assurance has been obtained from the
Government that it will cover any cash flow deficits, provided such deficits
are not the result of inefficient management and operation of the project
companies, during the initial three years of operations. Efficiency criteria
were agreed at negotiations. Moreover, if the Government adopts an alterna-
tive funding policy to allow for equity-type funding (para. 9.3), it plans to
allow the companies to convert a portion of local loans to the companies' own
funds so that they can achieve a long-term debt/equxity ratio of 75:25 or
better. An assurance has been obtained from the companies that they will pre-
pare and furnish to the Bank for review. by October 31 of each year from 1990
to 1998, their rolling five-year financial plans, including production, mar-
keting and investment plans, in the form of projected financial statements.
Such plans will be supported by: (a) a detailed analysis of production cost
trends; (b) analysis of operational and financial budget variances for the
current fiscal year; and (c) financing arrangements for the investments
proposed over the five-year period.
E. Auditing and Reporting Requirements
9.11     An assurance has been obtained that the companies will have their
annual financial statements and project accounts audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. They will also submit the audit report for
both the production and capital construction accounts to the Bank within six
months after the close of each fiscal year. Based on project progress and the
financial reports submitted by the project companies, MCI will provide the
Bank a quarterly summary of the project progress and procurement status, and a
semi-annual summary of the companies' financial statements, within 45 days
after the end of each period. An assurance was obtained that the Government
will have MCI's Project accounts for the technical assistance component, and
the accounts for the Special Account, audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. It will submit the audit report to the Bank within
six months after the end of each fiscal year. Within six months after the
closing date for the project, the companies and MCI will prepare and provide



- 40 -
te the Bank a completion report for their respective components of the
project, to cover project implementation, initial operation, actual project
costs and projected costs and benefits.
X. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
10.1     Calculations of the economic rates of return (ERR) for the investment
components were made on an incremental basis. The key assumptions in the
economic analysis of the Project are detailed in Annex 10.1.
A. Economic Costs and Benefits
10.2     Economic Benefits.  The quantifiable economic benefits of the
Project, expressed in 1989 US dollars, come from two major sources: (a) phos-
phate fertilizer (TSP and MAP) production utilizing phosphate rock from the
mines to be developed under the Project and other local raw materials such as
pyrites, ammonia and high-quality rocks from Yunnan Province (Dayukou and
Huangmailing); and (b) improved economic efficiency of production through the
restructuring of existing inefficient operations, including the conversion of
production from low economic value fertilizers (ABC) into high economic value
fertilizers (MAP) (Huangmailing).
10.3     The economic prices of fertilizer products were derived from their
projected international prices. The economic ex-factory prices of MAP and TSP
were derived from their CIF import prices by adding unloading, port handling,
bagging and mixing charges, and inland freight from ports to the plant sites.
10.4     Economic Costs.  The economic value of tradeable inputs was based on
their estimated FOB export prices. The economic value of pyrites at each
plant was derived from their estimated long-term marginal production cost.
Non-tradeable inputs were converted to their economic value by applying their
respective specific conversion factors.
B. Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
10.5     The base-case ERRs in constant terms are 17.9% for the Dayukou com-
ponent (JPCC) and 14.02 for the Huangmailing component (HPCC). The ERR for
the entire Project is 16.72. The streams of economic costs and benefits for
the ERR calculations are given in Annex 10.2.
10.6     The results of the sensitivity and switching-value analyses are sum-
marized in Table 10.A.

/a A 102 discount rate is used.
The results of sensitivity tests indicate that the ERRs for the Project are
sensitive to changes in, in descending order, sales benefits (which are
closely related to the international border prices of phosphate fertilizers
and production volume), project capital costs, and variable costs. Even
assuming a 202 reduction in sales benefits, the Project would obtain a satis-
factory ERR of 11.5Z. The switching-value analysis of the major variables
indicates that the Project would remain economically viable under various
conceivable adverse conditions, and confirms that the price of fertilizers is
the most critical variable determining the economic viability of the Project.
C. Other Benefits
10.7     Once full operating capacity is reached, the Project will lead to net
import substitution of high-grade phosphate fertilizers of 320,000 tpy of P205
that will result in gross foreign exchange savings of about US$196 million
equivalent p.a. in 1989 prices. After netting out the annual service of the
foreign debt (both principal repayment and interest payments), the net annual
foreign exchange savings, as of 1996, are estimated at about US$180 million
equivalent (see Annex 10.3 for details).



- 42 -
D. Project Risks
10.8     No extraordinary commercial risks are foreseen, given the general
shortage of phosphate fertilizers, particularly high-grade products, and the
apparently buoyant Chinese fertilizer market. The main technical risks lie in
coordinating the implementation and commissioning of the high-grade fertilizer
plants and associated mines. As observed in the cases of JPCC's new Wangji
mine and HPCC's mines (paras. 5.8 and 5.12), poor coordination in implementing
integrated mine and fertilizer plant investments, executed by separate
entities under separate budgets, has been a common cause of underutilization
of new mines in China, resulting in a significant loss of economic benefits.
In order to reduce this risk, both mine development and fertilizer plant con-
struction of the Dayukou and Huangmailing components will be implemented under
the same project management and budget. This risk will be further mitigated
by involving internationally experienced consultants in the technical
assistaace component. They will help MCI and the project companies with
project implementation and staff training.
AI. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING LOAN NEGOTIATIONS AND RECOMMENDATION
11.1     During negotiations, confirmation was obtained from the Government
that:
(a) all necessary Arrangements for the provision of local funds will be
made to finance the local costs of the Project (para. 8.5); and
(b) if the Government adopts an alternative policy to allow for equity-
type funding i'jr new investments of state-owned enterprises, it plans
to allow the two project companies to convert a portion of local
loans to the companies' own funds so that they can achieve a long-
term debt/equity ratio of 75:25 or better (para. 9.10).
11.2     During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Government
would:
(a) allow the project companies to market their entire output outside the
state allocation plan at negotiated prices (para. 3.26);
(b) maintain MCI's project coordination team during project implementa-
tion (para. 7.4);
(c) on-lend the proceeds of the Bank loan to JPCC (US$94.15 million) and
HPCC (US$42.85 million) under subsidiary loan agreements that will
specify terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, including an on-
lending rate equal to 105% of the Bank variable loan rate, with a
commitment charge of 0.75Z p.a. and repayment over 20 years, includ-
ing 5 years of grace (para. 8.4);



- 43 -
(d) cover any cash flow deficits of the project companies during the
initial three years of operations, provided such deficits are not the
result of inefficient management and operation of the companies
(para. 9.10); and
(e) meet the auditing and reporting requirements (para. 9.11).
11.3     During negotiations, assurances were obtained from JPCC and HPCC that
each would:
(a) prepare and furnish to the Bank for comments by December 30, 1990, a
comprehensive program to strengthen management, recruit qualified
staff and provide training, and thereafter carry out the agreed pro-
gram (paras. 5.10 and 5.14);
(b) maintain their respective project management teams during pro4ect
implementation (para. 7.5);
(c) build and operate the project mines and plants with due regard to
safety, ecological and environmental factors and in accordance with
environmental standards satisfactory to the Bank (para. 7.10);
(d)  maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 once that
ratio is reached, but no later than December 31, 1994. The companies
will not incur any long-term debt unless their projected internal
cash retention for each fiscal year during the term of the debt to be
incurred will exceed 1.2 times their pxojected debt service require-
ments in that year (para. 9.10);
(e) maintain a long-term debt to equity ratio of 75:25 or better once
that ratio is achieved, but no later than December 31, 1994 for JPCC,
and December 31, 1996 for HPCC (para. 9.10);
(f) maintain a current ratio of at least 1.2 once such a ratio is
achieved, but no later than December 31, 1994 for JPCC, and December
31, 1995 for HPCC (para. 9.30);
(g) prepare and furnish to the Bank for review, by October 31 of each
year from 1990 to 1998, their rolling five-year financial plans, to
cover production, marketing and investment plans, to be presented in
the form of projected financial statements (para. 9.10); and
(h) comply with the auditing and reporting requirements (para. 9.11).
11.4     During negotiations, an assurance was obtained from JPCC that it
would prepare supply and transport arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for
the required quantity of Yunnan phosphate concentrate adequate for TSP produc-
tion by December 31, 1991 (para. 6.4).
11.5     Conditions for loan effectiveness are:



- 44 -
(a) signing of subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and HPG,
and HPG and JPCC and HPCC under terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank (para. 8.4); and
(b) approval of the loan agreement by China's State Council.
11.6     With the above assurances and arrangements, the Project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$137.0 million equivalent to the People's Republic of
China at the Bank's standard variable rate for 20 years, including 5 years of
grace.

HUBEI PHOSPHATE PROJECT
An Outline of the Phosphate Subsector
Investment Optimization Model
A. The Transport Model
1.       Objective.  The objective is to optimize the transport of raw materi-
als, intermediates and final products in meeting the demand for phosphate
fertilizers.
2.       A Mathematical Programming Formulation.  To find the "cheapest" route
between sets of origins and sets of destinations, a linear-programming model
was developed, with four major networks--rail, river, ocean and road--repre-
senting the transport system.
3.       Results.  The cheapest mode of transportation is derived from simul-
taneous determination of the location size, timing and process of future fer-
tilizer plants and importing ports, and distribution patterns.
B. The Industry Model
4.       Objective. The objective is to assess alternative locations, sizes,
products and distribution patterns associated with investment projects in the
st.bsector.
5.       A Mathematical Programming Model Formulation.  A mixed-integer pro-
gramminig model was designed to minimize the total costs of investments, pro-
duction, transportation, and imports such that:
(a) demand for P205 is satisfied in each province through small-scale
production (for SSP, DAP and CMP), production in the modern sector or
imports;
(b) mine and plant production at each location is limited by existing
capacity but can be expanded by new investments;
(c) phosphate rock and pyrites production in each region is limited by
available domestic reserves;
(d) policies limit the percentage of P205 demand in each province that
can be satisfied by certain products; and
(e) transport out of certain regions is severely constrained.
6.       Results.  The desired result is a national optimization giving at
each location:

(a)  the production levels of raw materials, intermediates and final fer-
tilizer products and the processes employed;
(b) the scale of the mines and production plants;
(c) the investments in the sector under economies of scale;
(d) the shipment patterns of raw materials to plants, of intermediate
materials between plants, and of final products to markets;
(e) the domestic purchase of raw materials, intermediates, labor and
miscellaneous inputs;
(f) the export of products to export regions; and
(g) the import of intermediates to plants and final products to markets.

G. Dawu Ammonia Plant
Capacity:                 The capacity of the existing coal-based ammonia/ABC
plant at Dawu will be expanded from 15,000 tpy of
gaseous to 30,000 tpy of anhydrous liquid NH3
Process:                  The Wuhan Chemical Design Institute (WCDI) has been
involved in similar revamps and will employ its expe-
rience with local technology to expand the ammonia
plant
Supply of NH3:            Ammonia from the Dawu plant will be transferred to
MAP plant by pipeline or road, whichever proves more
feasible; it is anticipated that ammonia plant will
be achieving design output rates soon after recommis-
sioning; to facilitate full utilization of output,
the design of the MAP plant will also allow
production of DAP
H. Infrastructure
Mine site:                Workshop, store, equipment service facilities
Plant site:               Workshops, stores, effluent treatment plant, labora-
tories, offices
Social infrastructure:   Housing and welfare facilities at Dawu.

Outline for Training on Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) AnalXsis
Objectives
1.       Main objectives of the training on hazard and operability analysis
(HAZOP/HAZAN), to be carried out by the Ministry of Chemical Industry as part
of the technical assistance component, are tot (i) stimulate and improve
awareness for safety and operability aspects among related Chinese government
agencies, research and design institutes, and enterprises involved in the
chemical processing industry; and (ii) strengthen the capabilities of Chinese
design institutes for identifying and analyzing potential sources of safety
hazards and major production losses in chemical plant design and operation.
tlork Scope
2.       A consultant will be appointed tos  (i) present in China a seminar on
HAZOP/HAZAN techniques; and (ii) conduct workshops to practice the application
of those techniques in sector-specific case studies.
3.       Presentation of HAZOP/HAZAN Seminar.  The seminar will cover all
major areas of basic and advanced HAZOP/HAZAN techniques and highlight general
aspects of other methodologies for technical risk analysis (e.g. hazard sur-
veys and inventories; systems reliability/fault tree analysis; event tree
analysis; risk assessment and safety audits). Major topics to be covered by
the seminar are: (a) basic principles; (b) planning and timing; (c) selection
of study teams; (d) study procedures; (e) evaluation of potential problems;
(f) recording of the study; and (g) processing of actions.
4.       Presentation of Workshops with Sector-Specific Case Studies.  Follow-
ing the seminar, 2-3 workshops will be conducted to promote the practical
understanding and application of the HAZOP techniques explained. The number
of participants in each workshop will be about 20. Appropriate industry-
specific case studies including typical Chinese conditions should be presen-
ted. Each of the workshops will last about 5 days.
Work Plan
5.       The consultant will prepare a work plan for the assignment which will
be reviewed by MCI and the World Bank. MCI will, in consultation with design
institutes, prepare case studies for presentation during the workshops.

HUBEI PHOSPHATE PROJECT
Assumptions Underlying the Financial Analysis
A. General
1.       The financial projections were carried out in current yuan using
projected domestic inflation rates for local inputs and outputs and interna-
tional inflation rates for imported inputs as followss annual domestic infla-
tion rates--15.0 for 1989, 10.02 for 1990, and 8.0% thereafter; and annual
international inflation rates--5.3% for 1989/90, and 4.1% thereafter. The key
assumptions for financial projections were based on the actual annual perfor-
mance of companies under Chinese regulations. To provide an overall view of
the companies' financial performance in accordance with conventional account-
ing concepts based on international accounting standards, the following
adjustments were made to the Chinese accounting systems (a) the two sets of
financial statements--production operations and capital construction were
consolidated; (b) the accounts in the income statements and balance sheets
were reclassified as necessary in accordance with conventional concepts; and
(c) the sources and applications of funds statements that do aot exist under
the current Chinese accounting system were prepared. For financial rate of
return (FRR) calculations, cost and benefit streams in constant yuan were
used. The assumed capacity utilization and production levels with and without
the Project are given in Table 1 of this Annex.
B. Income Statements
2.       Sales Revenue.  Sales prices are assumed to be maintained at levels
indicated by MCI and SPB as the expected sales prices for project output as
the following: Y 750/ton for TSP and Y 900/ton for MAP. Net sales revenue
were calculated after deducting the product tax. During Project implementa-
tion, Project companies will not pay the product taxes under special arrange-
ments. The rates of the product tax are as follows: 3% for TSP and MAP, and
102 for aluminum fluoride.
3.       Variable Production Costs.  Annual consumption of inputs was obtained
from the material balance and estimated production levels with and without the
Project. Materials balances for each company with and without the Project are
given in Project File Ref. No. 2.
4.       Depreciation.  Fixed assets were depreciated using the straight-line
method at rates agreed on between the companies and their respective supervis-
ory authorities as followss (a) Dayukou--over 15 years; and (b) Huangmailing
--over 12 years. In addition, a mining maintevence fee of Y 7/t of ore
charged by all the companies was included.
5.       Maintenance Costs.  In the Chinese accounting system, maintenance
costs are divided into two categories--annual overhaul and other. Provisions
for annual overhaul are provided as a percentage of the original acquisition

value of the fixed assets and are managed separately within the special fund
account. Other maintenance costs were covered as operating expenses. The
rate of provision for annual overhaul for the companies is 62.
6.       Interest Expenses.  Interest on foreign exchange-denominated loans
were converted into local currency using projected foreign exchange rates,
assumed to be adjusted to preserve the relative currency values between the
two currencies.
7.       Taxes.  Taxable income is derived from net profits after deducting
the amortization of long-term loans, and is taxed at a uniform rate of 55?.
The companies will not pay income and adjustment taxes on profits during Proj-
ect implementation and the repayment period of the Bank loan.
C. Balance Sheets
8.       Fixed Assets.  Fixed assets are shown at their historical costs.
9.       Equity.  The following four items are considered as "equity,' given
their equity "nature': (a) state fixed funds; (b) state circulating funds;
*c) enterprise fixed funds allocated from internally generated funds; and
(d) net special funds (special fund assets minus special loans) retained by
enterprises.
D. Funds Flow Statements
10.      Depreciation Fund.  The current Government policy allows companies to
retain 1002 of the fund.
11.      ExDenditures from Special Funds.  Provisions for annual overhaul were
used to cover annual overhaul expenses. Annually, 15? of the retained depre-
ciation fund and profits are paid to the Energy Conservation Fund. The compa-
nies will be exempt from this contribution during Project implementation. A
portion of internally generated funds (in the special fund account) is used
for: (a) production technology development; (b) improvement of workers' liv-
ing condition; (c) cash bonuses; and (d) new product test fund. The balance
is accumulated within the company as reserve funds.

CHINA
HUBEI PHOSPHATE PROJECT
Assumptions Underlying the Economic Analysis
A. General
1.       The economic rates of return (ERRs) were calculated on an incremental
basis for the three fertilizer plants. Prices were expressed in constant
January 1989 US dollars. The economic life of phosphate mines was assumed to
be 20 years based on the size of their proven exploitable phosphate reserves.
The economic life of downstream fertilizer plants was also assumed to be 20
years. The assumptions for the production levels of the plants with and
without the Project are presented in Table 1 of Annex 8.1. The following
conversion factors, which were provided by Bank economic work, were applied to
the financial prices of nontradeable goods and services to derive their
economic prices:
Nontradeable items                   Conversion factor
Unskilled labor                             0.6
Technical labor                             2.0
Electricity                                 3.4
Local machinery                             1.4
Construction                                1.3
Rail transport                              1.5
Other                                       0.7
B. Capital Cost
2.       The economic capital cost of each project element expressed in
January 1989 prices was obtained from the financial base capital cost after:
(a) deducting the duties and taxes on equipment and other items; (b) deducting
the costs of those spare parts that are to be included in the operating costs;
and (c) applying conversion factors to nontradeable goods and services for
economic valuation.
C. Working Capital
3.       Incremental economic working capital requirements for each project
element were derived by comparing goods and services employed in production
with and without the Project.
D. Economic Benefits
4.       Economic benefits of the Project come mainly from two major sources:
(a) phosphate fertilizer (MAP and TSP) production utilizing locally available
phosphate rock, pyrites and ammonia; and (b) improved economic efficiency of
production through the conversion of low economic-value fertilizers (SSP and
ABC) to high economic-value fertilizers (MAP and TSP). The economic prices of

- 89 -                          Page 2 of 3
internationally traded products were derived from their latest projected
international prices, taking into accounit marine freight from the origin of
export to China ports, unloading and port handling charges, and inland rail
freight to plant sites. Marine freight, estimated from the latest statistics,
were assumed to change in line with international energy costs.
5.       The projections of the economic prices for each product are given in
Table 1 of this Annex. The kev assumptions were:
(a) Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP). Since MAP is not actively traded in
the international market, its economic value was derived from the
economic value of DAP, TSP and urea, taking into account their rela-
tive nutrient contents (MAP 122 N; 52? P205; DAP 18% N: 462 P205; TSP
46% P205; urea 462 N).
(b) Triple Superphosphate (TSP). The import rarity price of triple
superphosphate (TSP) is derived from the price of imported TSP from
the US Gulf coast, plus freight and bagging costs.
6.       Savings in transportation costs are attributed mainly to the
reduction of transportation volume because of the higher nutrient content of
MAP and TSP. Potential savings in terms of transportation distances were not
considered because nf difficulties in measuring them.
E. Operating Costs
7.       Tradeable Raw Materials.  The economic cost of exportable inputs was
derived by adding to the netback prLces, from exports at the production sites,
the inland transportation costs between the production and the plant sites.
The netback value of inputs at the production sites was calculated by deduct-
ing inland freight between the sites and exporting ports from the FOB export
prices. The economic cost of importable inputs was based on their projected
internationa' Drices plus marine freight from the origin of export to ports in
China, plus inland i:reight to the plant sites. The economic values of the
major tradeable inputs are given in Table 2 of this Annex. The key assump-
tions were:
(a) Coal. Coal is currently exported from China. The economic cost of
the coal delivered at the plant sites was derived from the netback
from export prices.
(b) Fuel Oil. The economic value if fuel oil was based on the netback
prices of fuel oil exports to Singapore. The international price of
fuel oil was expected to move in line with international crude oil
prices, as currently projected by the Bank.
(c) Diesel Oil. Since China is an importer of diesel oil, the economic
value of diesel oil was derived from the import price from Singapore
plus transportation costs to the plant sites after adjusting for
ocean losses and insurance.

8.       Other Nontradeable Items.  The economic value of nontradeable inputs
was based on their long-term marginal production costs plus inland tranuporta-
tion costs adjusted by specific conversion factors. The following assumptions
were made for major nontradeable inputs:
(a) Pyr'tes. Pyrites are not actively traded in the international mar-
ket. The pyrites used for the Project cannot be exported economic-
ally because of their grade and unfavorable location.
(b) Utilities, Chemicals and Bagging Materials. The economic costs of
other nontradeable items such as utilities and locally purchased
chemicals were derived from their financial costs by applying spe-
cific conversion factors.
9.       Fixed Costs.  The economic coRts of various fixed cost items,
including labor, general selling and administrative costs, were based on
financial costs adjusted by specific conversion factors. Maintenance costs
were conservatively assumed at over 8Z of the original acquisition costs
throughout the life of the project.
