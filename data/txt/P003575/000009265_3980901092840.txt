IMPLEMENTAll[ON COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
HUBEI PH[OSPHATE PROJECT
(LOAN 3066-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Hubei Phosphate
Project in China, for which Loan 3066-CHA in the amount of $137 million was approved
on May 23, 1989, and made effective on January 12, 1990.
The loan was closed on March 31, 1997, following one eighteen month and one
six month extensions to the original loan closing date. of March 31, 1995.  Final
disbursement took place on July 7, 1997, following provision of a four-month grace
period.
The ICR was prepared by Roger Heath, Industry and Mining Division, Industry
and Energy Department, Finance and Private Sector Development and reviewed by Zafar
Khan, Private Sector Development Unit, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office. The
Borrower provided inputs to the ICR that are included as Annexes.
Preparation of this report began during the Bank's ICR mission in April 1997. It is
based on material in the project file. The Borrower contributed to the preparation of the
ICR by exchanging views on the project preparation, procurement, implementation and
initial operations' experience and related issues; by preparing its own set of evaluations on
the project's preparation and execution; and by commenting on the draft ICR.

CHINA
HUBEI PHOSPHATE PROJECT
(LOAN 3066-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Hubei Phosphate Project was one of four fertilizer projects financed by the
Bank in China to assist in implementing the three top priorities that the Government had
set for the sector, which the Bank agrezd with, namely: (a) expansion, rehabilitation and
energy saving in nitrogen production; (b) rapid expansion of phosphate fertilizer capacity
using locally available phosphate rock; and (c) development of domestic potash
resources. The first project-the Fertilizer Rehabilitation and Energy Saving Project
(Loan 2541-CHA) dealt with five large- and medium-size ammonia/urea plants. The
second project was the Fertilizer Rationalization Project (Loan 2838-CHA), which was to
improve efficiencies at five plants, expand phosphate production at one of them, and
improve institutional capacities through the introduction of modem financial and
operational management. The third and fourth projects were the Phosphate Development
Project (Loan 2958-CHA) and the Hubei Phosphate Project (Loan 3066-CHA)--the
subject of this ICR-both of which were to expand phosphate fertilizer supplies and serve
as demonstration projects for further development of the country's phosphate resources.
Project Objectives
2.    The project was to assist China in achieving its priority goals for the fertilizer
sector, especially in reducing the nutrient imbalance in fertilizer use by rapidly expanding
cost-effective and economic production of high-grade phosphate fertilizers from domestic
phosphate resources. Specifically the project was to finance one large- and one medium-
scale integrated phosphate mine amd phosphate fertilizer production projects,
implemented, respectively, by JingxiarLg Phosphate Chemical Company (JPCC) located
at Dayukou, and Huangmailing Phosphate Chemical Company (HPCC) located at
Huangmailing. These projects had been identified as a result of a Phosphate Subsector
Study carried out jointly by the Ministry of Chemical Industries (MCI) and the Bank
during project preparation, which developed a computer-based model to define an
optimal investment program to develop local phosphate deposits. Consultancy services
were also included to strengthen the project management capabilities of MCI.
Implementation Experience and Resuilts
3.    Project implementation was initially delayed due to counterpart funding problems
and then suffered serious implementation delays and local currency cost overruns. Trial



- vi -
production commenced at Huangmailing in June 1996 and June 1997 at Dayukou-
respectively, 26 and 38 months later than appraisal estimates-but neither of the projects
attained projected capacity utilization rates in the first year of operation and both are
experiencing excessive mechanical problems. Due to the implementation delays, cost
overruns and poor initial production performance, the financial and economic prospects
for the projects fall far short of appraisal estimates. Financial rates of return are 3.0
percent for Dayukou and 2.5 percent for Huangmailing compared to respective appraisal
values of 14.2 and 13.1; the economic rate of return (ERR) is acceptable for Dayukou at
11.4 percent but unacceptable for Huangmailing at 4.2 percent; respective appraisal
values were 17.9 and 14.0 percent. The combined economic net present value for the
project is negative at -US$28 million for a discount rate of 10 percent compared with the
appraisal estimate of US$119 million. However, both projects are likely to generate a
flow of benefits large enough to exceed the expected marginal costs of operation and be
able in time to produce the design quantities of high-grade phosphate fertilizers. On this
basis, the project is considered sustainable. Financial restructuring to relieve debt and
maintain adequate liquidity levels is required for both projects.
4.    The technical assistance component focused mainly on strengthening the project
entities as the role of MCI had changed to setting sector policy rather than direct
participation at the project level. The training in hazard and operability studies (HAZOP)
that MCI was to have carried out did not take place due to lack of bilateral funding. This
had no impact on other project components.
5.    The project was completed at a cost of US$649.1 million, compared to the
appraisal estimate of US$5 10.2 million (Part II, Table 8a). Financing arrangements were
essentially as planned (Part II, Table 8b) with central and provincial governments
covering the part of the financing not covered by the Bank loan. The project construction
was completed at Dayukou in April 1997, Huangmailing was completed one year earlier,
and the commissioning of the Dayukou facilities was finished in June 1997. This
compares to the planned construction completion date for both Dayukou and
Huangmailing of September 1993, a delay of 44 months.
6.    Project commencement was delayed due to constraints on funding availability.
Throughout the periods of major project construction there was very high local inflation
and delays arose as the annual funding allocations would be found to be insufficient due
to rising costs. Construction activities would be delayed until additional funds could be
allocated. During the initial procurement phases there were delays in finalizing the
engineering design arrangements and subsequent delays in finalizing technical
specifications for equipment and plant items to be procured by international competitive
bidding (ICB). Adequate project monitoring and control systems for cost and schedule
were lacking. Efforts midway in the project to remedy the situation were not effective and
this lack was a contributing factor to project delays and cost overruns. Procurement was
generally handled well, but coordination for ICB was complex and there were instances
of delays in Bank approval of procurement actions that contributed to project delays.

Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
7.    The estimated financial and economic benefits for the project are much lower than
the appraisal estimates and, with exception of the estimated ERR for Dayukou, are
unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, it is likely that with debt relief, Dayukou and Huangmailing
can become successful fertilizer producers. Considerable training for all levels was
successfully carried out during the project and both companies are well placed to
overcome the present teething problems and become viable commercial entities.
8.    The technical issues of project preparation were handled well by all parties and no
changes in project scope were found to be necessary during implementation. Issues of
project organization and management, however, were not adequately dealt with during
project preparation and there was no consensus on the scope of specialized project
management assistance required. The technical assistance provided was useful and
appreciated by the implementing agencies but was insufficient to deal with the problems
that arose. Efforts to improve project monitoring and control once implementation is
underway are likely to be only effective where there is already a basically sound system
in place and the necessary improvements are only incremental.
9.    Key lessons learned include:
*  The efficient implementation of such fertilizer projects requires special skills and
management systems that are quite different from those needed for efficient
production operation. At the time of project preparation, arrangements should be
agreed for the necessary specialist assistance during the construction period so that
the operating company is not burdened with these responsibilities, which then detract
from the efforts that the companies should be making to ensure good design and
construction quality control, and to prepare for the startup and operating phase. In the
case of the project, where the companies had no prior experience of operating such
complex facilities, it is even more important that management energies are free to
concentrate on the operating phase and that adequate technical assistance resources
are provided within the project for these purposes. Measures during implementation
to improve project management monitoring and controls are likely to succeed only
where these are incremental to an already familiar and well established project
management system.
*  Project components, such as the HAZOP training, should have a direct relevance to
the project and external funding should either be assured at appraisal or provisions
made for funding from the loan proceeds.



CHINA
PHOSPHATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(LOAN 3066-CHA)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION
1.    The project, together with the P:hosphate Development Project, Loan 2958-CHA
(see ICR No. 16244, January 14, 1997), was to assist China in achieving one of the
priority goals set for the fertilizer sector under the Seventh and Eighth Five-Year Plans:
reduction of the nutrient imbalance in fertilizer use by rapidly expanding the production
capacity for high-grade phosphate fertilizer products through cost-effective economic
utilization of domestic phosphate resources. An important part of this assistance was the
Phosphate Subsector Study carried out jointly by the Ministry of Chemical Industries
(MCI) and the Bank during project preparation to define an investment program to the
year 2000 to develop local phosphate deposits.
2.    Specifically, the objectives of the project were to:
•  provide financial and technical assistance in implementing some of the first major
projects of the investment program developed from the Phosphate Subsector Study;
and
*  strengthen the project management capabilities of MCI to reduce the technical risks
with the development of large-scale integrated fertilizer complexes.
3.    Dayukou and Huangmailing were selected to provide models for the integration of
phosphate mines and fertilizer plants using modem mining, beneficiation, and
manufacturing technologies for the production of high-nutrient phosphate fertilizers.
4.    The project had three major components:
*  Dayukou Phosphate Mine and Fertilizer Production Development--establishing:
(a) a new open-pit mine of 1.5 million tons per year (tpy) phosphate rock capacity, to
replace the existing mine; (b) a moclem beneficiation plant to produce 0.65 million
tpy of concentrate; and (c) fertilizer production facilities and related infrastructure for
560,000 tpy of triple superphosphate (TSP), 200,000 tpy of phosphoric acid, and
12,000 tpy of by-product aluminum fluoride.
*  Huangmailing Phosphate Mine and Fertilizer Production Development-
establishing: (a) a new open-pit mine of 1.0 million tpy phosphate rock capacity, to
replace the existing mine; (b) a modern beneficiation plant to produce 0.24 million



- 2 -
tpy of concentrate; (c) fertilizer production facilities and related infrastructure for
180,000 tpy mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP), 93,000 tpy of phosphoric acid; and
(d) the rehabilitation of a small coal-based ammonia plant to produce 30,000 tpy of
ammonia as feedstock for the MAP production. The then existing small-scale Single
Super Phosphate (SSP) and Nitrogen Phosphorous Potassium Complex Fertilizer
(NPK) facilities would be shut down after commissioning of the new facilities.
I'echnical Assistance, carried out by MCI consisting of:
* consultancy services to MCI's project coordination team for project
management, technology selection, production startup, and mine equipment
maintenance; and,
* consultancy services for training in hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis
for chemical plant design and operation.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
5.    Sector Policy Improvements. During project preparation for both the Phosphate
Development Project (Loan 2958-CHA) and the Hubei Phosphate Project, the important
sector policy issue of correcting the imbalance in fertilizer nutrient use as regards
phosphates was examined in detail by the Bank and MCI in concert. Methodologies for
identifying the most cost-effective solutions were developed, and specific investment
recommendations were made that have formed the basis for the two projects supported by
the Bank and other projects in the sector.
6.    Physical Objectives. The project was designed to produce 2.5 million tpy of
phosphate ore for processing by beneficiation to yield 0.89 million tpy of phosphate
concentrates starting in April 1994. The concentrates were to be further processed at the
two project sites to give, after reaching stable capacity utilization rates of 90 percent in
the third year of operation, 509,000 tpy of TSP (Dayukou), and 164,000 tpy of NIAP
(Huangmailing); these are high-grade phosphate fertilizers with a total phosphate nutrient
content of 320,000 tpy Phosphorous Pentoxide (P205). Project construction commenced
in January 1990 (Dayukou) and March 1992 (Huangmailing), approximately 12 months
behind the original plan of January 1989 for Dayukou and 26 months behind the plan of
January 1990 for Huangmailing. These initial delays were due to delays in government
approval of the project design, technology selection, and mobilization of local funds.
Construction was then completed in 89 months in April 1997 for Dayukou, 35 months in
excess of the original forecast of 54 months; and, 49 months in April 1996 for
Huangmailing, 5 months in excess of the original forecast of 44 months. Construction
delays were due to procurement problems, delays in finalizing detailed engineering,
delays in allocating local financing, and late delivery of some equipment.
7.    Final performance tests for Dayukou were carried out in May 1997 and
commercial operation commenced thereafter. Huangmailing completed final performance
tests in December 1996, and commercial operation commenced in January 1997. The



-3 -
performance tests have been successful, with the exception of the production of
concentrate at Dayukou where the ball mills for grinding the phosphate rock can only
reach 80 percent of design output. Other sources of concentrate are available to Dayukou
so that the production of finished fertilizer will not be affected. Nevertheless, during 1997
production performance for both projects has been much lower than the expected 60
percent, with capacity utilizations of 12 percent for Dayukou, and 21 percent for
Huangmailing: rates for the first two months of 1998 were 13 percent for Dayukou and
42 percent for Huangmailing. The annual production plans of fertilizers and their sales in
the domestic market are presented in the Operations Plan attached to the ICR mission
Aide Memoire (annexed to this report). This indicated that capacity utilization rates of at
least 90 percent should be met no later than year 2000, three years after completion of
final performance tests. However, on the basis of the 1997 results it is likely that stable
capacity utilization rates of at least 90 percent will not be reached until year 2001, and
only at that time will all the physical objectives have been met.
8.    Technical Assistance Objectives. The technical assistance for technology
selection was satisfactorily completed early on in project implementation. It included
visits by international specialists to China and visits of Chinese managers and engineers
to selected sites to view particular teclmologies in operation. Technical assistance for
project management, operation, and maintenance was successful in providing advice on a
number of technical issues impacting on operation and maintenance and in ensuring that
these areas received early attention. The assistance was less successful in improving
project management, and the introduction of computer based scheduling and management
information systems for the construction phase was ineffective.
9.    The technical assistance for HAZOP training was intended to be financed from
bilateral sources and no allocation had been made from the loan funds. MCI was
unsuccessful in securing bilateral financing and, in consequence, this component was not
implemented. Failure to implement the component had no direct effect on the Dayukou
and Huangmailing Projects as the necessary studies were included in the project
engineering.
10.   Institutional Development. The implementing agency for the Dayukou is the
Jinxiang Phosphate Chemical Company (JPCC) which, prior to the project, operated three
phosphate mines with a total output of 2.5 million tpy, and a large beneficiation plant.
JPCC had no prior experience in finished fertilizer production and sales. An agreed
program of recruitment, training, and management strengthening was carried out by
JPCC to prepare for these new responsibilities. Considerable effort has been put into
strengthening JPCC, and much has been achieved. The company is fully aware, however,
that the strengthening and training efforts must continue to receive high priority for the
next several years until successful sustainable commercial operation is achieved.
Implementation of the Huangmailing Project is by the Huangmailing Phosphate Chemical
Company (HPCC) formed by the merger, during project preparation, of two fertilizer
companies with phosphate mining and fertilizer production and sales operations. An
agreed program of recruitment, training, and management strengthening was carried out



-4 -
by HPCC. Considerable attention was given early on to recruiting and training new
operations staff, and retraining existing staff and the company is well placed to
successfully operate the facilities. As with Dayukou, it is recognized that training at all
levels needs to bo continued as a high priority during the early years of operation. Both
companies have benefited considerably from staff attending training courses coordinated
by MCI at other fertilizer sites, including training carried out under the Phosphate
Development Project (Loan 2958-CHA).
11.   Environmental Protection. The major environmental concerns were the safety of
the mine tailings dams, minimization of ground and surface water pollution from the
phosphogypsum disposal system, and achievement of international standards for
emissions from the sulfiric acid and fluorine recovery plants, and the safety of ammonia
transport to the Huangmailing MAP plant. All of these potential problem areas were
subject to detailed studies. Measures to ensure safe operation and minimize
environrnental impact have been carefully designed and implemented. In the case of the
phosphogypsum disposal systems, for which there is limited design experience in China,
visits to facilities abroad were organized by the management consultant before designs
were finalized for the two projects. The mine tailing dams were put into operation early
on and are operating satisfactorily: the measures to control surface water drainage into the
tailings pond at Huangmailing have been very effective in minimizing solids discharge
into the Huanshi River, a minor watercourse that is, nevertheless, important for farming
in the area. Effective monitoring systems are in place to record and control effluent
discharges at both project sites.
12.   Economic and Financial Objectives. Moderate economic and financial benefits
were estimated at project appraisal. Based on results for 1997 and projections for future
performiance, these benefits are considerably lower than originally forecast, and while
they are still positive (Part II, Tables 8a, 8c and gd) they are unsatisfactorv with the
exception of the economic rate of return (ERR) for Dayukou. The estimated ERR for this
ICR of 11.4 percent for Dayukou and 4.2 percent for Huangmailing, compared with
estimated rates at appraisal of 17.9 and 14.0 percent, respectively, demonstrate the extent
to which the project has failed to meet economic objectives. For both combined, the ERR
would be 9.1 percent, giving a net present value (NPV) of -US$28 million for a discount
rate of 10 percent . Financial rates of return (FRRs) are now forecast at 3.0 percent for
Dayukou and 2.5 percent for Huangmailing compared with the appraisal estimates of 14.2
and 13.1 percent, respectively. The table below shows, as percentages, the increase over
Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) estimates in project costs when expressed in terms of US
dollars and Yuan, and also the increase in the local financing requirements in Yuan terms:



-5 -
COST INCREASES (PERCENT) OVER SAR ESTIMATES
Project       Cost              US$ total         Yuan total    Yuan local financing
Dayukou       Installed Cost        4.4             113.5             127.9
Total Financing     19.2             136.1             155.7
Huangmailing   Installed Cost      37.3             156.0             194.1
Total Financing     44.7             168.0             203.7
Both projects experienced much higher lacal currency costs and attendant local financing
increases (156 percent for Dayukou, and 204 percent for Huangmailing) and longer
implementation periods than considered at appraisal (including the periods for achieving
stable commercial production levels). These have been major factors in depressing the
financial and economic rates of returns for the projects. In the case of Huangmailing, the
project has experienced, in addition, considerably higher (37.3 percent ) installed costs in
US dollar terms than at appraisal so that local financing increases have proportionaily
been much higher than Dayukou. The project cost increases have been partially offset by
increased product prices that the enterprises are able to achieve; MAP sales price has
increased by 150 percent in yuan terms over prices at appraisal, and TSP prices have
similarly increased by 100 percent. The FPRRs are very sensitive to sales price decreases:
a 10 percent price decrease would give negative FRRs of -0.3 percent for Dayukou, and
-0.4 percent for Huangmailing. Such a decrease is, however, unlikely as sales prices
remain below import parity prices by around 40 percent for TSP (Dayukou), and 13
percent for MAP (Huangmailing) and China will remain a major importer of phosphate
fertilizers for the foreseeable future. The more likely problem facing the enterprises is in
reaching stable commercial capacity utilization rates (60 percent in 1998, 75 percent in
1999, and 90 percent in 2000 and onward): a 10 percent reduction in such rates would
reduce the FRR for Dayukou to 1.8 percent and that for Huangmailing to 1.1 percent,
similarly ERRs would be reduced to 9.0 percent for Dayukou and 4.2 percent for
Huangmailing.
13.   Public Sector Management. The project was the first in a planned series of
phosphate fertilizer investments to be implemented by MCI to improve domestic supplies
and provide high-grade inputs. MCI has been closely involved in all phases of project
preparation, planning and implemental:ion. However, the role of MCI in project
implementation has changed appreciably over the period of Bank support for the China
fertilizer sector and especially during the project period: MCI now plays a much less
active role in direct project management, while still retaining a role as facilitator and
coordinator. As a result the consultant services for implementation have focused, almost
exclusively, on the needs of the two operating companies, rather than the building of
skills within MCI.

C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
14.   The project has not yet met its primary development objective-the provision of
additional high-grade phosphate fertilizers through the cost-effective economic utilization
of domestic raw materials. In the case of Huangmailing it is most unlikely that these
goals can be met. Compared with the estimates made at appraisal, project implementation
and construction periods have been considerably extended, project costs are much higher,
and the buildup of production much slower. The factors that have contributed to this poor
performance are: counterpart funds were not available to allow the projects to proceed on
the original schedule, the project construction period was one of high local inflation and
credit squeezes, engineering arrangements and critical procurement activities were
delayed, project management was deficient in establishing effective schedule and cost
control, and preparations for the operating phase have not been effective.
15.   Factors not Subject to the Borrower's Control. China experienced considerable
local inflation of domestic construction inputs (steel, cement, equipment, labor, etc.)
during the major period of project implementation. Cement, for example, increased in
price from Y 105 to Y 338 per ton from 1989 to 1993. This not only increased project
costs, but contributed to delays as although the annual allocation of credit to the projects
was niade on time, the allocation would be found later on to be insufficient to cover price
rises and construction activities would be constrained until provision of additional funds
would be made. At the project level this situation was exacerbated by the national credit
squeezes that the Government was obliged to impose for macroeconomic reasons,
resulting in considerable increases to interest rates on project funds.
16.   International prices for high-grade phosphate fertilizers have not changed
appreciably from projections made at appraisal. However, the international price of
sulfur, an important raw material input for the manufacture of such fertilizers, has
decreased considerably from a price at appraisal of around US$110 to US$35 per ton (all
FOB Vancouver). Had such existing sulfur price levels been foreseen, it would have been
much more cost-effective to have designed the projects to use imported sulfur instead of
local pyrites as not only is the cost of imported sulfur equivalent to that of local pyrites
(on a sulfur content basis), but the capital cost of sulfur-based sulfuric acid plants is
around 40 percent of a pyrites-based plant, and the cost of operation and maintenance of
the sulfur-based plant is considerably less than the pyrites-based plant.
17.   Factors Subject to the Borrower's Control. The project was part of an
ambitious program to develop local phosphate resources, but the full extent of the
domestic financing resources required had not been assured so that it was found necessary
to stagger projects that had been planned for parallel implementation: both Dayukou and
Huangmailing suffered such delays. There was also delay in finalizing engineering
arrangements for the process plants. Financing required for the HAZOP training was not
secured.

18.   Factors Subject to the Implementing Agencies' Control. The implementing
agencies were the two companies JPCC and HPCC. Both companies were unable to
establish effective monitoring and cont-ol over project cost and schedule. As a result,
there were delays-in initial procurement due to excessive time taken to finalize technical
specifications for international competitive bidding (ICB); there was poor
synchronization of activities so that some components and infrastructure were completed
well in advance of need while progress in other critical areas was delayed; and updating
project costs to completion was too slow and infrequent to allow timely remedial
measures to be considered for controlling costs-this was a particular problem in the case
of Huangmailing where civil structure and installation costs were over six times the
amount in yuan estimated at appraisal. Quality control during construction and
commissioning was not effective and both companies have, as a result, experienced
severe delays in reaching reasonable operating levels due to many mechanical problems.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
19.   It is likely that the project will reach and maintain the physical objective of
producing high-grade phosphate fertilizers with a total nutrient content of 320,000 tpy
(P,05). However, although both of the projects can cover current costs, provided they
attain commercial capacity utilization rates, neither of them is able to service the major
part of the debt incurred. It is possible for Dayukou to generate adequate economic
benefits, but due to high investment costs the economic benefits from Huangmailing will
be unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, each project is likely to generate a flow of benefits large
enough to exceed the expected marginal costs of operation, in both financial and
economic terms. On this basis, the project is considered sustainable.
E. BANK: PERFORMANCE
20.   Project preparation and appraisal dealt well with the major technical issues of
project design and implementation and, indeed, there were no changes found to be
necessary in project scope during implementation. The treatment of institutional
development issues was less thorough. No specific measures or action plans were agreed
with the two project entities to upgrade management controls, implement specific training
programs, and improve the performance of their existing operations. Also, the problems
of technology transfer, particularly difficult for JPCC with no prior experience in
fertilizer manufacture, were not specifically addressed. The technical assistance
component was effective and considered successful by the implementing agencies but
was modest in the resources allocated, and focused mainly on technical issues of design
and implementation.
21.   Supervision missions, especially in the early implementation stage were timely
and effective in clarifying the causes of early implementation delays and forming a
consensus between the various parties on actions required to move the project forward.
Supervision missions also identified deficiencies in monitoring and control of costs and



-8 -
schedules, but the remedies proposed-adoption of foreign computer-based scheduling
systems-were too late in the project cycle and were not effective.
22.   Procurement for the two projects was complex as coordination was necessary
among the foreign and local engineering design consultants, MCI, the foreign
procurement agency China National Chemical Corporation (CNCC), and the
implementing agencies JPCC and HPCC. Also, most of the process critical items were
procured together for both projects, requiring very close coordination. Although most of
the procurement was handled well, there were instances where Bank approval on
procurement documentation for time and process critical equipment was delayed and
contributed to overall project delays.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
23.   Availability of counterpart funds was a problem throughout most of the project
implementation period due, in large part, to the necessary introduction of economic
reforms. The funding problems were thus not unique to the project and considerable
efforts were made to make funds available during a difficult regime of much higher local
inflation than expected. While there was strong support for dealing with the technical
aspects of project design and implementation, there was a lack of recognition by the
borrower on the need for strong technical assistance support for project management.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
24.   While the physical objective is considered attainable, the financial benefits are
unsatisfactory. Although the ERR of Dayukou is satisfactory the combined economic
benefits of the two projects generate a negative NPV of -US$28 million at a discount rate
of 10 percent compared with a value of US$119 million projected at appraisal. The
problems in project implementation and in quickly achieving commercial levels of
capacity utilization indicate that the institutional objectives have not been fully met and
that there is a risk that financial and economic benefits will be even lower than now
estim;nated. Thus, the project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
25.   It is taking longer than expected for both projects to overcome the mechanical
problems that have caused the extended commissioning periods. The occurrence of such
problems is not unusual in such complex chemical facilities and none of the problems
experienced are of a severity that would prevent commercial operation. The major task
for both companies is to expeditiously solve the mechanical problems that are preventing
full operation and bring the plants to stable commercial operating levels. Once this is
achieved, they will then concentrate on improving plant efficiencies and cutting costs.
Both companies are pursuing discussions with the central and provincial governments for
financial restructuring that will relieve the companies from liquidity problems.



26.   Indicators for monitoring and evaluating the future operation of the project were
that they should reach stated capacity utilization factors of 60 and 75 percent in the first
and second years of operation, respectively, and then maintain a capacity utilization rate
of 90 percent from the third year onwrard. These indicators have not been met.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
27.   The efficient implementation of such fertilizer projects requires special skills and
management systems that are quite different from those needed for efficient production
operation. At the time of project preparation, arrangements should be agreed for the
necessary specialist assistance during the construction period so that the operating
company is not burdened with these responsibilities, which then detract from the efforts
that the companies should be making to ensure good design and construction quality
control, and to prepare for the startap and operating phase. In the case of the project,
where the companies had no prior experience of operating such complex facilities, it is
even more important that management energies are free to concentrate on the operating
phase and that adequate technical assistance resources.are provided within the project for
these purposes. Measures during implementation to improve project management
monitoring and controls are likely to succeed only where these are incremental to an
already farniliar and well established project management system.
28.   Project components, such as ithe HAZOP training, should have a direct relevance
to the project and external funding should either be assured at appraisal or provisions
made for funding from the loan proceeds.

TABLE 9c: ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS-UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
1.    Economic capital costs are considered as the same as the financial costs as the
project was exempt from duties.
2.    The real prices of inputs and outputs in economic terms were assumed to remain
unchanged at the end-1997 levels over the life of the project. Actual production levels
were used for 1997, projected capacity utilization rates were assumed as follows:
1998       1999        2000 and Onward
Capacity Utilization %    60.0        75                90
3.    The economic prices of TSP and MAP were derived from Bank commodity price
data for FOB US Gulf export price, delivered to a Chinese port. Import parity prices were
calculated as follows:
US$/ton
MAP    TSP
FOB US Gulf             221    172
Bagging                  20     20
Shipping                 25     25
Port and Inland Transport    25  25
Total            291    242
4.    The economic price of aluminum fluoride was taken as US$1,000 per ton based
on international prices.
5.    The economic price of the major raw material input, pyrites (35 percent sulfur), is
very sensitive to the rail tariff as the pyrites is transported from Yunnan, a distance of
1,665 kilometers. The financial rail tariff is Y 0.06 per ton-kilometer comprising Y 100
per ton of the delivered price of Y 265 per ton of pyrites. This gives an equivalent cost
per ton of sulfur of US$90 per ton against a price for imported sulfur of US$80 per ton.
(US$55 CIF + US$25 for inland Iransportation.), so that substitution of pyrites with
imported sulfur is already marginally attractive. With the economic rail tariff set at the
estimated value of US$0.03 ton-km, the equivalent sulfur price would be US$118 per ton,
making the use of pyrites totally unattractive compared with imported sulfur. This would,
as an example, depress the ERR for Dayukou from 11.4 to 7.4 percent. For these reasons
the cost of sulfur (pyrites) has not been increased from the financial value for calculation
of the ERR.
6.    No shadow wage rates were used for labor, since wages plus nonoperational
expenses already reflect the cost to the company of the social services provided to its
labor force, including housing, education, hospitals, social security (pensions and
unemployment, accident and health insurance), food services and fuel and retail outlets.

ANNEX 1: ICR MISSION AIDE MEMOIRE
April 23, 1996
1.    A World Bank mission consisting of Mr. Roger Heath and Dr. Wang Xiang (Consultant)
visited China during the period April 13 to 23, 1997 to carry out the implementation completion
review for the above project. Together with representatives of the Ministry of Chemical
Industries (MCI) and Hubei Provincial Chemical Bureau the mission visited the project sites of
the Jingxiang Phosphorous Chemical Company (JPCC) and the Huangmailing Phosphate
Chemical Company (HPCC), and met in Wuhan with officials of the Hubei Provincial
Government. The mission discussed, in detail, all aspects of project implementation and related
issues, the projects' future operations, and focused on review of the Implementation Completion
Report (ICR). The mission wishes to thank all project entities, Hubei Provincial Government
(HPG), and MCI for the excellent cooperation extended to the mission. The views expressed in
this Aide Memoir are subject to confirrnation on the mission's return to Washington.
2.     Each of the project entities provided drafts of its contribution to the ICR including
comments on the project implementation and performance. Also provided were the five year
financial plans and indicators for the Operations Plans for both JPC and HPCC. Specific
objectives of the entities that under-pin these plans were reviewed. The mission will further
review the operations plans on return to Washington and send its comments to MCI and the
project entities. These revised plans will then be included in the ICR.
3.     There was no major divergence of opinion between the mission, MCI and the project
entities in terms of the project implementation record and related issues or future operation of the
project. Project construction and commissioning have been completed successfully for all units
at HPCC and the plants are now in the full commercial operation stage. For JPC, commissioning
and performance tests of the mining and beneficiation, and sulfuric acid plants have been
completed. Commissioning of the phosphoric acid plant is underway, the GTS]' plant has been
completed and operated extensively on SSP production, and the Aluminum F luoride Plant is
expected to be mechanically completed in May 1997 and commissioned by end June 1997. The
goal of commencing commercial production by end June 1997 is realistic.
4.     The major problems faced by both projects are the adverse financial impacts of the large
local currency cost over-runs and the delays in project completion. Agreement was reached that
the two problems were linked and thet the very considerable price escalation for local supplies
over the project period, and the resulting difficulties and delays in marshaling the extra
unplanned investment sources required were the major reasons for completion delays.
5.     As a result of the delays and cost over-runs the projects will not be able to service all
their debts in the initial years of operation. The mission pointed out that in accordance with
Section 4.03 of the Loan Agreement, the Borrower has undertaken to cover any cash flow
deficits of the company during its first three years of operation. The mission also expressed
concern that JPC and I-PCC both show debt/equity positions inferior to the 75:25 debt/equity
structure covenanted in the Project Agreement, in the case of JPC the position is very



- 24 -                        ANNEX I
considerably inferior at around 91:9. HPG assured the mission that this issue is under active
review and that State Council has set a 75:25 debt equity positions as the minimum equity
holding to be achieved by all fertilizer projects. Conversion of debt to equity has already
occuired for JPC to move it closer to the covenanted value further conversions for JPC and
similar conversions for HPCC are planned.
6.     MCI and HPG confirmed that all project outputs were being marketed outside the state
allocation system at freely negotiated prices.

ANNEX 2: OPERATION PLANS FOR THE JPCC AND HPCC
JPCC--Dayukou
1.    Mining and beneficiation was completed in September 1996. Performance tests
for the sulfuric acid plants are under way, and those for the phosphoric acid, aluminum
fluoride and TSP plants are planned for June 19997.
2.    The major task for JPCC in the short and medium  term  is to attain high
production rates from the process plants as early as possible. In order to achieve this the
problerns that have been encountered during commissioning activities need to be solved.
These problems include:
*  The capacity of the Ball Mill can only reach 80 percent of design;
*  Incorrect material has been installed in the pyrites roaster section of the sulfuric acid
plants leading to mechanical failure and low reliability;
*  Mining equipment bucket excavators have excessive wear and control systems are
unreliable; and,
*  The hot gas generator in the TSP Plant for granulation gives problems with coal as
fuLel.
3.    JPCC 1-las set its goals for capacity utilizationi as 39 percent in 1997. 71 percent in
1998, 80 percent in 1999, and 100 percent in 2000 and onwards. Sales will initially be
through large distribution companies. Later JPCC will develop its own marketing, as is
the case for sales of aluminum fluoride.
4.    The company is organized under two main cost center units: Dayukou Mining and
Beneficiation, and Dayukou Chemical Complex. The later unit is quite new and will need
continuing strengthening. With the help of the World Bank the financial management of
JPCC is improved; but this will continue to gradually improve.
5.    JPCC  Practices "three wastes" treatment and has paid muchi attention to
environmental aspects in design and construction. Regular monitoring is carried out for
all waste discharges to insure that the required standards are met.
6.    We hope to take advantage of the State policy to convert debt to equity so that
JPCC equity will be at least 25 percent and thereby improve the financial situation. TIhe
rolling fiFve-year financial plans are presented in the following tables.

HPCC-Huangmailing
1.    HPCC commissioned the mining and beneficiation in June 1994, the ammonia
renovation was completed in April 1995, and qualified product MAP/DAP was produced
in December 1996.
2.    HPCC is working hard to attain reasonable production rates from the plants as
early as possible. Some problems that have been found during commissioning are to be
solved:
*  Mining excavation equipment has lower productivity than design and operating hours
have to be extended to compensate;
* Problems with the rubber lining of the phosphoric acid concentration section need to
be solved;
* The double flap valves of the roaster section of the sulfuric acid plant are showing
high wear and are not sealing correctly;
* Speed of the MAP elevator is incorrect-design fault; and,
* The storage for slurry is not sufficient (2-3 days) and needs to be increased for
operational flexibility.
3.   'HPCC plans for production levels of 70 percent in 1997, 90 percent in 1998, and
1 00 percent in 2000 and onward. Most of the output will be marketed through negotiated
contracts with large distribution companies, about 10 percent will be sold locally.
4.    The existing facilities for Single Super Phosphate (SSI'), Amonium Bicarbonate
(ABC), and Nitrogen Phosphorous Potassium Complex Fertilizer (NPK) will be kept in
operation as sales of these products are good. HPCC will also examine recovery of
products from the calcined pyrites and waste gypsum. It has already been successful in
recovering carbon dioxide from the ammonia plant for sale to carbonated beverage
producers.
5.    HPCC is experimenting with substituting some of the pyrites to the sulfuric acid
plant with sulfur to improve operation and decrease costs.
6.    H-IPCC has made great efforts to digest and absorb the advanced international
process technology and basically master the perfomiance of equipment. Thlese efforts will
continue and the training center will continue in operation.
7.    Environmental management of the "three wastes" has highi priority so that the
I-Iuanshui River is not polluted.

8.    The Provincial Government has already converted some of HPCC loan into
equity, Y 518 million up to end 1996 and further amounts are expected in 1997. The
rolling five year financial plans for H[PCC are shown in the following tables.

ANNEX 3: BORROWE'R'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
A. REVIEW BY MCI
Background
1.    Hubei Phosphate Project (Loan No. 3066-CHA) focused on the development of an
efficient domestic phosphate fertilizer industry by using local indigenous phosphate rock
resources and was the fourth operation in a series of the World Bank interventions that
aimed at assisting GOC's program for improving overall fertilizer sector performances.
The GOC was going to establish two high-grade phosphate fertilizer production bases by
using local phosphate rock resources in the Jinxiang and Huangmailing mine areas in
Hubei province to increase domestic phosphate rock and phosphate fertilizer production
and help reduce the imbalanced application of the three nutrients, namely nitrogen,
phosphate and potash. The Project consists of the following three components:
(a) The Dayukou Phosphate Mine and Fertilizer Development Component,
involving construction of: (i) a new open-pit mine of 1.5 million tpy ROM rock
capacity; (ii) a 1.5 Mtpy ore feed beneficiation plant, to produce 0.65 million tpy
of phosphate rock concentrate; (iii) a 560,000 tpy pyrites-based sultfuric acid
plant; (iv) a 200,000 tpy phosphoric acid plant (100% P205); (v) a 560,000 tpy
TSP plant; (vi) a 10,000 tpy aluminum fluoride plant, (vii) infrastructure.
(b) The l-luanigmailing Phosphate Mline and Fertilizer Development Component,
involving construction of: (i) an open-pit minc of 1.0 Mtpy ROM rock capacity;
(ii) a 1.0 Mtpy ore feed beneficiation plant, to produce 0.30 million tpy of
phosphate rock concentrate (33% P2Oj); (iii) a 280,000 tpy pyrites-based sulfuric
acid plant; (iv) a 93,000 tpy phosphoric acid plant (100% P205); (v) a I 80,000 tpy
DAP/MAP plant; (vi) a 6,00(0 tpy sodium fluorosilicate plant; (vii) expansion of
the existing coal-based ammonia/ABC plant from 15,000 tpy of gaseous to 30,000
tpy of anhydrous liquid NH3; (viii) infrastructure.
(c) The Technical Assistance Component:
(i) Consultant Services for Project Implementation. This technical
assistance will provide internationally experienced consultants for MCI's
project coordination team, who will help the team  and the project
companies with: (a) selection and procurement of appropriate technologies
and equipment; (b) tirnely identification and resolution of problems with
project implementation; (c) training of project management team staff; (d)
preparation of staff recruitment and training programs; (e) implementation

(ii) Training in Hazard and Operability Analysis. In order to stimulate and
improve awareness for safety and operability aspects among related
Chinese government agencies, research and design institutes and
enterprises involved in the chemical processing industry, and to strengthen
the capabilities of Chinese design institutes for identifying and analyzing
potential sources of safety hazards and major production losses in
chemical plant design and operations, MCI will sponsor a workshop on
modern methodologies for hazard and operability analysis, with assistance
from internationally experienced consultants.
Implementation Review
2.    Overall, the implementation and performance of the Project are considered very
satisfactory together with project scope optimization and compliance with project
objectives. The completion of the two project components has increased China's high-
grade phosphate fertilizer production even further after the operation of the Guizhou
(Wengfu) Phosphate Development Project, thus improving the balance of the three
nutrients.
3.    Final performance tests have verified that the imported technologies and
equipment were advanced, reliable and up to the design standards (excluding the
hydraulic excavators of the mine and ball mills of Dayukou component, which can not
reach full capacity due to technical problems). The professional skills of staff at virtually
all levels and enterprise management standards have been significantly enhanced by
adoptive of imported technology and equipment and by intensive internal and external
training and consulting services. The performances of the production facilities for the two
project companies have attained internationally advanced levels not only in temis of
efficiency, reliability and product quality but also in human resources development.
4.    One component of the technical assistance component-Consultant Services for
Project Implementation was completed and achieved the expected objectives.
5.    The processes, technologies and equipment were selected with assistance from the
Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. of the United States, Mr. F. Sheldrick (a senior fertilizer
specialist engaged by the Bank, also the Bank's former employce), the CHEM Systems
International LTD and the BETE Inc. of the States. Thc performance tests veriFied the
international competitiveniess of the technology and the equipment in terms of efficiency
and reliability.
6.    The consultant Services for Project Implementation were provided by Mr. Dahan,
a senior consultancy specialist recommended by the Bank. Mr. Dahan visited the project
sites for three times, identifying and resolving various issues with project implementation
with respect to technical (beneficiation processes; piping and filtration of concentrate



-37 -                        ANNEX3
slurry; transportation, storage and disposal of pyrites cinder and phosphogypsum;
environmental protection; erosion prevention and the safe transport of anhydrous liquid
ammonia) and managerial problems (development of PMIS, MIS and FMIS). Mr.
Dahan's suggestions in addressing  those problems were basically  accepted  and
implemented and contributed a lot to the smooth implementation of the Project.
7.    The other component of the technical assistance-Training on Hazard and
Operability Analysis has not been carried out due to lack of funds (During project
appraisal, an understanding was reached that the financing for this project component
would be covered by the bilateral aid and IDA's technical cooperation credit, but till now
the funds has not been available yet.).
MCI's Role in Project Implementation
S.    Through its Foreign Funds Utilization Office (FFUO), MCI's role in the
execution of the Project was to supervise implementation of all project components,
regularly review progress on project implementation and coordinate the efforts of all the
related government agencies to remove implementation constraints.
Cooperation with the World Bank
9.    During the whole course of the project implementation, the cooperation between
the Foreign Funds Utilization Office (FFIJO) on behalf of MCI and the Bank has beenl
very satisfactory. Whenever difficulties or problems arose, they were promptly identified
and resolved through bilateral friendly discussions and consultations. Thc guidelines antd
procedures adopted by the Bank in appraising and implementing the project were concise,
scientific and efficient. Bank requirements and suggestions to the exeCutin(g agencies
were rational and accepted. Generally, Bank officials in charge of appraisal and
implementation supervision as well as the technical specialists engaged for the Project
were skillful, competent and responsible. They have played an important role in the
implementation of the Project.
Lessons Learned and Prospects
10.   As an agriculture-oriented country with a population of over 1.2 billion, China
needs to continue to import large quantities of fertilizer to respond to the ever-increasing
demand of its agriculture sector. But in the long run, Chiina will have to set Up a sound
and  competitive domestic  fertilizer industry  to support a sustainied  agricultural
development in an environment that calls for substantial increases in yield and variety.
Particularly, priority should be given to the development of its phosphate fertilizer sector
due to the imbalanced production of the three nutrients (oversupply of nitrogell,
insufficient supply of plhosphate and lack of potash). China's relatively rich phosphate
rock resources provides good opportunities for the development of its phosplhate feirtilizer
industry. In this context, Bank-financed projects aimed to increasing China's phosphate
fertilizer production with local indigenous phosphate rock resources complies with the



- 38 -                      ANNEX3
GOC's fertilizer industry development strategy. We hope the Bank will continue its
assistance in this respect.
11.   Out of various reasons, the completion dates for the two project components were
delayed for 2-3 years, which affected their respective economic benefits significantly. On
the other hand, since demands for high-grade phosphate fertilizer in the domestic market
remain high, the social and economic benefits of the two project components will
dernonstrate after the commercial operation of the production facilities.
12.   The Technical Assistance Component stipulated during project negotiations is
considered very helpful. The performance of the selected process technologies and
equipment witlh assistance from internationally experienced consultants has attained
international level, which ensured the successful implementation of the Project. The other
TA component-Training in Hazards and Operability Analysis was not completed due to
unavailability of the financing. We sincerely hope the Bank would provide further
assistance so that we could complete this work in the near future.
B. THIE DAYUKOU AND HUANGNIAILING COMPONENTS
Section 1. Project Implementation and Assessment
Project Background
13.   As an agriculture-based country that accounts for 22% of the world's population
but only 85 of its cultivated area, The Chinese Government's major concern is how to
produce maximum  foodgrains on its limited cultivated land bv means of scientific
application of fertilizers so that China can achieve self-sufficienicy in its basic food
requirements. The soil fertility in a majority of the land is not good, and about 70% of
which is lack of phosphate nutrient caused by low-application of phosplhate fertilizer.
Therefore, the Chinese Government is striving to increase the production of its phosphate
fertilizer, especially high-grade phosphate fertilizers such as TSP and MAP/DAP. As one
of the provinces in China which are endowed with large size phosphate rock deposits,
Hubei province is located in central China and has good access transportation and
sufficient power supply. Both Jinxiang and Huangmailing are existing state-owned mine
areas, where phosphate rock reserves are large. In each of the two mine areas, there are
production facilities for mine, beneficiation plant, some small existing SSP, NPK
compound fertilizer, ammonia and ABC plants as well as related infrastructure. Based on
the above considerations, the GOC decided to construct a 560,000 TSP plant and a
180,000 tpy MAP/DAP plant in each of the two mine areas.
Project Content
14.   The l-lubei Phosphate P'roject comprises the Dayukou I'hosphate Mine and
Fertilizer Development Component and the l-luangmailing P'hosphate Mine & Fertilizer
Development Component. The Project's financing was jointly met by the World Bank
loan, domestic loans arranged by GOC and the Hubei Provincial Government (FIPG) and



- 39 -                     ANNEX3
internal funds of the project companies. The Dayukou component, which would be
carried out by JPCC, involves establishment of: (a) a new open-pit mine of 1.5 Mtpy
ROM rock capacity; (b) a 1.5 Mtpy beneficiation plant, to produce 0.65 million tpy of
phosphate rock concentrate (P205 33%, MgO<1.5%); (c) a 560,000 tpy TSP plant,
together with a pyrites-based sulfuric acid plant of 560,000 tpy capacity and a phosphoric
acid plant of 200,000 tpy P205 capacity; (d) a 10,000 tpy aluminum fluoride plant; and (e)
related infrastructure. The Huangmailing component, which would be carried out by
HPCC, involves establishment of: (a) a new open-pit mine of 1.0 Mtpy ROM rock
capacity; (b) a 1.0 Mtpy beneficiation plant, to produce 0.30 million tpy of phosphate
rock concenitrate (P205 33%, MgO<1.5%); (c) an MAP/DAP plant of 180,000 tpy
capacity, together with a pyrites-based sulfuric acid plant of 280,000 tpy capacity and a
phosphoric acid plant of 93,000 tpy P205 capacity; (d) a 6,000 tpy sodium fluorosilicate
plant; (e) rehabilitation of a small coal-based ABC plant to produce 30,000 tpy of
ammonia as feedstock for MAP/DAP production; and (f) related infrastructure.
Project Identification and Organization
15.   In October 1985, the State Planning Commission (SPC) listed the two projects
(the Dayukou and Huangmailing components) as standby World Bank loan projects; In
December 1987, the Bank appraised the feasibility studies of the two projects; In
September 1989, the Loan Agreement was signed jointly by the Chinese Government and
the Bank and became effective in January 1990. The construction of the two project
components was officially commenced in July 1990 and in June 1991 respectively. Ihe
two project components were rated as State key construction projects and enjoyed
prioritized treatment in the provision of capital, electricity, fuiels and raw mlaterials.
16.   MCI and I-IPG jointly established a Plroject Coordination Unit (PCU), unlder
wlhich are MCI's Foreign Funds Utilization Office (FFUO) and the Project Liaison Olffice
of the Hubei Provincial Petrochemical Bureau (I-IPPB). The PCU will regularly review
progress on project implementationi and procurement and coordinate efforts to remove
any constraints. Each of the two project companies established its own project
management team  charged with implementing its respective component (including
planning of implementation schedule, financial management and expenditure control,
procurement of equipment and materials, construction quality supervisioll, staff
recruitment and training, and start-up and production preparation. The engineering
contractor for the Fluangrmailing component was the China Wuhan Chemllical Engineering
Corporation (CWCEC). The construction quality supervisioni was done by the Chall-sha
Chemical Design Institute. TFle procurement agency was the China National Chemical
Constructioni Corporation (CNCCC) and the FlIubei Provincial Finance Bureau was
responsible for disbursement of the loan proceeds.
Project Implementation
17.   In accordance with the stipulations of the Loan Agreement, the two project
components would commence construction in September and be completed in September



-40 -                                      ANNEX3
1994. Actually, construction for the Huangmailing component began in July 1990 and
was completed in June 1996, a delay of I and 2 years respectively relative to the forecast
implementation dates; The Dayukou component construction began in June 1991 and was
comamissioned in June 1997, with delays of 2 and 3 years respectively compared to the
original dates. The delays were caused by the following factors:
(a) As the total investment for Wengfu, Huangmailing and Dayukou projects was
huge, the Chinese Government decided to carry out the three projects one by one
so as to make full use of the limited construction funds and ensure the smooth
implementation of the three projects;
(b) During project implementation, the total costs for the two project components
increased by 3.5 times due to higher-than-expected inflation rate, increase of
domestic loan interest rates and the fluctuation of foreign exchange rate. The
Governrnent had difficulties in raising the additional funds to meet the
requirements of the project construction;
(c) The procedures adopted by certain domestic government agencies and the
Bank in reviewing and approving the procurement packages were lengthy and
troublesome, which affected procurement schedules for imported goods.

The Achievement of Project Objectives
18.   Physical Objectives. (a) The mine for the Dayukou component was completed in
October 1995, and the 72-hour load run and performance tests were carried out in



- 41 -                      ANNEX 3
December of the year; The sulfuric acid plant was commissioned in June 1996, and the
load run and performance tests were carried out in September last year; The phosphoric
acid plant was commissioned in February, and load run and performance tests were
carried out in April this year; The TSP plant was commissioned in September 1996 and
produced up-to-standard granular SSP fe:rtilizer temporally. The 72-hour load run and
performance tests were conducted in May this year. (b) The mine for the Huangmailing
component was completed in April 1994, and the 72-hour load run and performance tests
were carried out in June of that year; The sulfuric acid plant was commissioned in
October 1995, and the load run and performance tests were carried out in December last
year; The phosphoric acid and MAP/DAP plant was commissioned in June last year, and
load run and performance tests were carried out at the year end; The ammonia plant was
commissioned in October 1994 and the '72-hour load run and performance tests were
conducted in December of that year.
19.   Managerial Objectives The two project components have adopted internationally
advanced technologies and management practices imported from abroad. The whole
production facilities have achieved autcmatic control and computerized operational
management, thus improving production efficiency significantly. Each of the two project
companies, namely JPCC and HPCC, has already established its own project
management team charged with implementing its respective component. Each of the two
project companies comprises its own mine, beneficiation plant and individual chemical
plants, and each plant is divided into production sections or workshops. With assistance
from the Bank, the financial management in the two companies has been strengthened.
The two project companies regularly submitted to the Bank the audited Financial
statements and other reports in line witlh thz Bank's requirements.
20.   Economic Objectives (a) In terms of 1987 price, the forecast econIomllic belnefits
for the Dayukou component were as followvs: The component would generate 460 million
Yuan of annual sales revenue and 190 million Yuan of profits and tax p.a.; Thle r;IRR
would be 13.08%, and the investment repayment period 10.94 ycars. Thc total cost for the
component jumped to 3.67 billion Yuan compared to the forecast of 1.466 billion Yuan in
project appraisal, which was caused by higher-than-expected inflation rate, increase in
local currency loan interest rate, fluctuation in foreign exchange rate and imposition of a
new investment regulatory tax on capital construction projects. Based on the present price
levels for raw materials, fuels and electricity, the selling prices of TSP and aluLmiinunm
fluoride are 1,500 Yuan/ton and 5,000 'Yuan/ton respectively. When full capacity is
reached, the project component will bring about 900 million Yuanl in sales revenue and
126 million Yuan in profits and tax annually, and the investment repayment period will
be 13.21 years. (b) In terms of 1987 price, the forecast economic benefits for the
Huangmailing component were as follows: The component would generate 150 million
Yuan of annual sales revenue and 80 million Yuan of profits and tax p.a.; The investment
rate would be 28.5%, and the investment repayment period 13 years. The total cost for the
component jumped to 3.67 billion Yuan compared to the forecast of 1.466 billion Yuan in
project appraisal, which was caused by higher-than-expected inflation rate, increase in
local currency loan interest rate, fluctuation in foreign exchange rate and imposition of a



- 42 -                      ANNEX3
new investment regulatory tax on capital construction projects. Based on the present price
levels for raw materials, fuels and electricity, and the selling price of DAP as 2,250
Yuan/ton, when full capacity is reached, the project component will bring about 430
million Yuan in sales revenue and 81 million Yuan in profits and tax annually, and the
investment repayment period will be 19.07 years (including construction period).
Project Outcome
21.   Social Benefits of the Project. The two project components were rated as the
State's key agriculture-supporting projects that would bring about significant social
benefits. When the Project is put into commercial production, it will produce 560,000
tons of TSP and 180,000 tons of MAP/DAP fertilizer annually for China's agricultural
sector, accounting for 21.5% of total production of China's high-grade phosphate
fertilizer. According to the estimate by agricultural departments, the newly-added
fertilizer from the Project will increase foodgrains production by 2.5 million tons
annually, or bring about an annual income of 430 million Yuan to Chinese farmers. In
addition, the completion of the Project will save more than $140 million worth of foreign
exchange annually, which otherwise would have to be used to import the same amount of
fertilizer.
Performance of the Bank
22.   Throughout the implementation period of the two project components, the Bank
sent several supervision missions to the project sites, w*hichi assisted MCI and the two
project companies to review project implementation statues and address project
implementation difficulties in an orderly manner. The Bank's assistance proved very
helpful in project identification, process and product line selection and procuremenict of
equipment and materials, as well as in project management. implenmentation schedule
supervision, expenditure control, financial management and staff training. The Bank
officials in charge of the Project specialists and consultants engaged lhave givenI manly
valuable recommendations and contributed a lot to the completion and commissiolning of
the project facilities. On the other hand, the procedures adopted by the Bank in reviewing
and approving procurement packages of technology and equipment were lengthy,
sometimes the officials in charge were not available at all, thus affecting procurement
efficiency. We hope the Bank will make some changes in this respect.
PerfDrmance of the Borrower
23.   MCI and HPG jointly established a Project Coordination Unit (PCU). under
which are MCI's Foreign Funds Utilization Office (FFUO) and the Project Liaison Office
of the HIubei Provincial Petrochemical Bureau (H-IPPB) to consolidate the project
implementation work. The PCU will regularly review progress on1 project implementatioll
and procurement and coordinate efforts to remove any constraints. Each of thc two
project companies established its own project management team comprising experienced
technical and managerial personnel (They have been given intensive external and internal
training.) that was charged with implementing its respective component. The major tasks



- 43 -                    ANNEX3
for the team included planning of implementation schedule, financial management and
expenditure control, procurement of equipment and materials, construction quality
supervision, staff recruitment and training, working-out work schemes and various
regulations, and -start-up and production preparation. With assistance from Bank's
specialists and international consultants, a computerized management system was
adopted in planning and accounting management. The capabilities of domestic research
and design institutes in chemical plant design and construction project management have
been strengthened by implementing the Project. The knowledge on the imported
processes and technologies with internationally advanced levels was digested, and the
operational features of the imported equipment mastered. The completion of the Project
marks the establishment of China's first large-scale phosphate mine and fertilizer
development projects. In addition, a large number of technical and managerial
professionals emerged and a managemernt mechanism in line with modern corporate
system was established within the two project companies. Now that the two project
components are completed and put into commercial production, they will give full play to
their economic and social benefits continuously.
24.   The Start-up of the project construction was delayed due to sharp increase in the
total cost. The implementation period was further delayed in part caused by delays in
mobilization of the local currency funds needed for construction and in reviewing and
approving procurement packages, thus reducing its financial and economic benefits.
Consultant Services Assessment
25.   With assistance from the Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. of the United States, the
two local design institutes, namely CMRDI and CMPDI, prepared the feasibility studies
for the mines and beneficiation plants of the Dayukou and Huangmailing components
respectively.
26.   With assistance from the CHEM Systems International LTD and the BETE Inc. of
the United States, the two local design institutes (NCEDI & WCEDI) prepared the
feasibility studies for the chemical plants of the two project components.
27.   Mr. F. Sheldrick (a senior fertilizer specialist engaged by the Bank, also the
Bank's former employee) was engaged to help the project companies with: (a) selection
and procurement of appropriate technologies and equipment; (b) engagement of
engineering contractors; and (c) preparation of bidding documents.
28.   The consultant Services for Project Implementation were provided by Mr. Dahan,
a senior consultancy specialist recommended by the Bank. Mr. Dahan put forward many
useful recommendations in project construction management, production and accounting
management, commissioning preparation, staff training, equipment maintenance and
institutional capacity building. Mr. Dahan also helped identify and resolve various
technical problems with the chemical plants facilities ( piping and filtration of concentrate
slurry; transportation, storage and disposal of phosphogypsum; environmnental protection;
and safe transport of anhydrous liquid ammionia).



- 44 -                     ANNEX3
29.   A few experienced domestic consultants were also engaged to provide needed
consultancy services in technical and managerial aspects of the project implementation.
For example, Mr. Han Qingchun, former chief engineer of the Design Institute under the
Nanjing Chemical Industry Corporation, was engaged for the Dayukou component;
Professor Wang Cunxin, a senior specialist on sulfuric acid production from the Wuhan
University was employed for the Huangmailing component.
30.   A commissioning assistance team composed of experts and technicians from the
Yunnan Yunfeng Chemical Industry Company and the Nanjing Chemical Industry
Company provided all-round services for the commissioning of the two project
components.
Operation Status
31.   The facilities for the mines, beneficiation plants and related infrastructure of the
two project components have been commissioned and put into commercial operation.
Due to quality problems of the hydraulic excavators (manufactured with technology
imported from Germany), the mines did not reach full production capacities. The ball
mills procured from the MPSI Company of the United States for the Dayukliou component
achieved only 80% of its nominal capacity. At present, the two project companies are
asking the suppliers to take effective measures to improve the performances of the
equipment, at the same time, the two companies are making their owIn efforts so that the
equipment can achieve full capacities as soon as possible. The FLIuangmailiing component
wvill reach a production capacity of 1.0 Mtpy of ore and 300,000 tpy of phlosphate rock
concentrates by 1997; And the Dayukou component will produce 1.1 Mtpy of phosphate
ore and 340,000 tpy of phosphate rock concentrate.
32.   All the chemical plants of the two project componlents have been commissioned
and put into commercial production. The projected productioni for the Dayuklou
component in 1997 is as follows: 400, 000 tpy of sulfuric acid, 170,000 tpy of phosphoric
acid (100%  P205), 220,000 tpy of TSP and 4,000 tpy of aluminumnl fluoride. The
estimated production for tlle Fluangmailing component in 1997 is as follows: 230, 000
tpy of sulfuric acid, 76,000 tpy of phosphoric acid (100% P,O5), 148,000 tpy of DAP
fluoride. It is expected each of the two project components will reach its respective
production capacity in 2-3 years.
Project Sustainability
33.   As an agriculture-based country with a population of over 1.2 billion, the
agriculture sector has always been the foundation and development priority of China's
national economy. The demand for fertilizer from agricultural sector has been increasing
steadily. China has always held that the supply of fertilizer relies mainly on its domestic
production and fertilizer imports should only be used as a supplement to domestic
production in variety and quantity. In the long run, there will be no difficulties in thc
selling of the fertilizer products from the two project components. Significant economic
and financial benefits were estimated at project appraisal. However, these benefits are



-45 -                       ANNEX3
lower than originally forecast that were caused by a few certain factors: First the Project's
total cost was 3.5 times larger than appraisal estimate; Secondly, the two project
component were commissioned only a few month ago; Thirdly, the reform on the pricing
policy is only at an early stage and the priDrity policies in provision of funds for fertilizer
project construction have not been in place. With the deepening of China's economic
reform, adopting of various priority policies for state-owned fertilizer enterprises and
effective control over fertilizer imports quantity, the pricing policy for domestic fertilizer
products will gradually become rationalized. In addition, with the commercial operation
of the production facilities and strengthening of management levels of the project
companies, the Project is considered likely to be financially and economically viable and
fully sustainable.
Project Financial Cost
34.   The total Financing required for the Dayukou component was estimated at 1.06
billion Yuan in the feasibility study, of which US$ 94.15 million was from the IBRD
loan; The cost estimate was adjusted to 1.46 billion' Yuan when the component
commenced construction; The total cost jumped to 3.67 billion Yuan as a result of higher-
than-expected inflation, increase in local currency loan interest rate and fluctuation in
foreign exchange rate, 3.5 times larger than appraisal forecast.
35.   The total financing required for the Dayukou component was estimated at 516
million Yuan in the feasibility study, of which US$ 42.85 million was from the IBRD
loan; The cost estimate was adjusted to 680 million Yuan when the component
commenced construction; The total cost jumped to 1.92 billion Yuan as a result of higher-
than-expected inflation, increase in local currency loan interest rate and fluctuationl in
forcign exchange rate, 3.7 times larger than appraisal forecast.
Conclusions
36.   Generally, the identification of the project components and achievement in project
objectives is satisfactory. As the first-batch mine and fertilizer development projects in
China, both the Dayukou and Huangmailing component focused on the development of
high-grade phosphate fertilizer (TSP  and DAP/MAP) witlh domestic indigenous
phosphate rock resources. The geographic locations of the two project components were
considered ideal in terms of transport of inputs and outputs. The load run tests for the two
project components were successful. At present the trial production is well underway in
the project companies, with product quality Up to design standard and emission levels
within the national permission standards.
37.   The  imported  technologies and  equipment are advanced  and  meet the
requirements of the production processes and local real situations. With the
implementation of the project, introduction of internationally advanced technologies and
high-performance equipment and intensivc internal and external training for thle staff, the
technical and equipment levels in the two project components have been improved



-46 -                        ANNEX3
significantly. The successful experiences in the implementation of the Project can be
copied to similar projects in the future.
38.   The economic and social benefits of the Project are considered satisfactory.
39.   Throughout the course of the project implementation, the World Bank assigned
several supervision missions to the project sites to help resolve various implementation
issues and provide all-round assistance in project components identification, selection of
processes and equipment and construction supervision; The Chinese government agencies
at all levels and related domestic financial institutions also made efforts in supervising
project implementation and providing various assistance; The China National Clhemical
Construction Corporation (CNCCC) did a very good job in the procurement of
technologies and equipment with the Bank loan proceeds. The efforts of all these parties
contributed to the smooth implementation of the Project.
