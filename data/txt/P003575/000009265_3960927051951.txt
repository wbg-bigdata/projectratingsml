MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR A HUBEI PHOSPHATE PROJECT
1.       I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the People's Republic of China for US$137.0 million equivalent to help
finance a Hubei Phosphate Project. The proposed loan would have a repayment
term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable inter-
est rate. The Government would on-lend the loan proceeds, throagh the Hubei
provincial government, to the two project companies at an interest rate equal
to 1052 of the Bank variable loan rate, with a repayment period of 20 years,
including 5 years of grace. The commitment charges and foreign exchange risk
on all on-lent proceeds would be borne by the project companies.
2.       Background.  China is the world's third largest producer and consumer
of chemical fertilizers. Despite the impressive build-up of production capa-
city during the last decade, China remains a large importer of chemical ferti-
lizer due to the rapid growth of fertilizer consumption. With limited arable
land available for agricultural production, China's priority in agriculture
has been placed on maximizing crop production per unit of land by increasing
fertilizer use for agriculture. Apart from the general shortage of fertili-
zer, a major constraint to increasing agricultural productivity is the short-
age of phosphate (P205) and potash (K20) fertilizers which causes an imbalance
in fertilizer nutrient use. The current nutrient ratio of 100 (N)s33 (P205):8
(K20) in China compares unfavorably with the agronomically desirable ratio of
100:50:20. This nutrient imbalance reduces the benefits of the current rela-
tively high level of nitrogen application. Over 70X of the cultivated area is
deficient in phosphate, about 40Z seriously so.
3.       The production of phosphate fertilizers in China has been low com-
pared to the large potential demand. Production has been limited to low-grade
products such as single superphosphate (SSP) produced by small phosphate fer-
tilizer plants located in almost every province. The low production was due
to technical difficulties in processing the Chinese phosphate rock, which is
available in abundant supply, into concentrate that is suitable for production
of high-grade fertilizers. In recent years, however, a new process for bene-
ficiating domestic rocks to produce high-grade fertilizers has enabled China
to look toward establishing an efficient local phosphate industry.
4.       In the past, the allocation and pricing of fertilizer was strictly
administered by the Government. In recent years, a two-tier market system has
emerged as a result of the ongoing reforms which call for expanding the role
of market forces in fertilizer production and allocation. Under the two-tier
system, all fertilizer plants sell their output at controlled prices for pro-
duction under the state plan quota and negotiated (market-influenced) prices
for that above quota. At present, about 402 of the country's total consump-
tion of all fertilizers, and about 152 of high-grade fertilizers, are sold
outside the state allocation plan at negotiated prices. The Government's



-2-
current strategy is to continue gradually reducing its administrative control
of '^.;llizer pricing, in parallel with gradually dismantling annual produc-
tion planning and allocation. Guidelines for future policy reforms are being
developed by an interagency working group formed within the Government. This
group is reviewing fertilizer pricing and allocation policies according to a
work plan discussed with the Bank.  However, given that the process of overall
price reform has temporarily slowed somewhat owing to government concerns that
such adjustments will further exacerbate current inflationary pressures, the
agenda for further changes in the fertilizer pricing and allocation system is
likely to be more protracted than originally anticipated.
5.       Ratiorvle for Bank Involvement.  The Project would help China realize
its priority in the fertilizer sector during the Seventh and Eighth Five-Year
Plans (1986-95). This priority is to reduce the nutrient imbalance by rapidly
expanding production capacity of high-grade phosphate fertilizers, based on
economically exploitable domestic phosphate resources. The focus of Bank
operations in the fertilizer sector initially was placed on rehabilitating and
rationalizing ex4.sting nitrogenous fertilizer plants which had low efficencies
and outdated technologies. The Phosphate Development Project (Loan 2958-C8A,
FY88) which was prepared and appraised concurrently with the proposed project,
expands Bank operations beyond the nitrogenous fertilizer subsector. During
Project preparation, the Bank helped to articulate the Government's phosphate
subsector development strategy and strengthen MCI's subsector planning capa-
bility by carrying out a joint Phosphate Subsector Study. This study has
helped the Government to identify priority investments, including optimal
location and product mix, to the year 2000. The Chinese authorities have
expressed interest in further Bank assistance in coaiducting follow-up work
emanating from the study and in carrying out similar Ftudies in other subsec-
tors.
6.       The integrated development of phosphate mines and high-grade fertili-
zer plants to be implemented under the Project would be the first of this kind
in China in terms of their size and configuration. They would help China to
gain the experience needed to implement further investments already identified
by the study. Bank involvement during project preparation already has helped
to optimize the configuration of mine and fertilizer plants, and the technical
assistance to be provided under the Project would strengthen China's project
management capabilities, particularly in establishing large-scale, multiple-
component chemical fertilizer complexes. Consultant services also will be
provided to strengthen the capacity of Chinese design institutes to identify
and analyze potential safety hazards and plant operability in chemical plant
design and operations.
7.       Project Obiectives.  Specific objectives of the Project are:  (a) to
support the implementation of the first phase of the Investment program devel-
oped as a result of the Phosphate Subsector Study undertaken during Project
preparation, and therebj provide a model for future investments in integrated
developuent of phosphate mines and fertilizer plants; and (b) to strengthen
MCI's project capabilities, particularly with respect to reducing technical
risks associated with the integrated development of phosphate mines and ferti-
lizer plants.



-3-
8.       Proiect Description.  The Project would consist of three components:
(a) the Dayukou mine and fertilizer development component--establishing a
560,000 tpy TSP plant and a 12,000 tpy aluminum fluoride plant at Dayukou in
Hubei, based on expansion of an existing mine to produce 3.5 Mtpy ROM ore, and
construction of a beneficiation plant at the mine site; (b) the Huangmailing
mine and fertilizer development component--establishing a 180,000 tpy MAP
plant at Huangmailing in Hubei, based on expansion of an existing snine to
produce 1.0 Mtpy ROM ore, construction of a modern beneficiation plant at the
mine site, and rationalization of an existing low-grade nitrogenous fertilizer
plant to supply ammonia for MAP production; and (c) the technical assistance
component--provision of consultant services in support of project implementa-
tion and mine workshop maintenance, and consultant services for training on
hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis in chemical plant design and opera-
tions. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank group
operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
aluo attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7417-CHA dated April 25, 1989,
is being distributed separately.
9.       Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed on the following major
actions: (a) to allow the two project companies (JPCC and HPCC) to market
their entire output outside the state allocation plan at negotiated prices;
and (b) to cover any cash flow deficits of the two project companies during
the initial three years of start-up, provided such deficits are not the result
of inefficient managemenw and operation.  In addition, if th'  wvernment
adopts a new funding policy to allow for equity-type fundink ..cr new invest-
ments of state-owned enterprises, it plans to allow the two project companies
to convert a portion of local loans to the companies' own funds so that they
can achieve a long-term debt/equity ratio of 75:25 or better. The two compa-
nies will: (a) prepare and furnish to the Bank for comments by December 31,
1990 comprehensive programs for management strengthening, and staff recruit-
ment and training, and thereafter carry out the agreed programst (b) maintain
respective project management teams during Project implementation; (c) build
and operate the project mines and plants with due regard to safety, ecological
and environmental factors and in accordance with environmental standards
satisfactory to the Bank; (d) maintain debt service coverage ratios of at
least 1.2 once that ratio is reached; (e) maintain long-term debt to equity
ratios of 75:25 or better once that ratio is achieved; (f) maintain current
ratios of at least 1.2 once that ratio is achieved; and (g) prepare and submit
five-year rolling financial plans for each year from 1990 to 1998. JPCC will
prepare the supply and transport arrangements satisfactory to the Bank for the
amount of outside phosphate concentrate required for TSP production by Decem-
ber 31, 1991. Conditions of loan effectiveness ares (a) signing of subsidi-
ary loan agreements between the Government and HPG, and HPG and each of the
companies on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank; and (b) approval
of the loan agreement by China's State Council.
10.      Benefits.  The quantifiable benefits of the Project derive from:  (a)
phosphate fertilizer (TSP and MAP) production utilizing phosphate rock from
the mines to be developed under the Project and other local raw materials such
as pyrites; and (b) improved economic efficiency of production through the
restructuring of existing inefficient operations, including the conversion of



-4-
production from low to high economic value fertilizers.  The ERR for the Proj-
ect is estimated at 172. Although the economic benefits from the Phosphate
Subsector Study undertaken during F.-rject preparation are unquantifiable, they
will be lazge and affect the entire sector. Indirectly, the Project will
generate significant economic benefits in agriculture by reducing the nutrient
imbalance and increasing the synergism of fertilizer application.
11.      Risk.  The main technical risks relate to the need for coordinated
implementation and commissioning of high-grade fertilizer plants and associa-
ted mines. In the past, the lack of proper coordination has been a persistent
problem in implementing integrated mine and fertilizer investments, which have
been executed by separate entities under separate budgets. This risk will be
mitigated by implementing both mine development and fertilizer plant construc-
tion under the same project management team and from the same budget, as well
as by assurances from the Government on diligent monitoring and coordination.
It will be further mitigated by the technical assistance subcomponent, which
will involve internationally experienced consultants in project implementation
and production start-up. Rigorous development and implementation of detailed
staff recruitment and training programs, with assistance from internationally
experienced consultants and local design institutes, would also help reduce
the risk.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

*   As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the
SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater
than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
Notes: 1) The status of the projects listed in Part A is described in a separate report on al
Bank/IDA financed projects in execution, which is updated twice yearly and circulat
to the Executive Directors on April 30 and October 31.
