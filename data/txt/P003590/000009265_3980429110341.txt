1. Preface
1.1 Project Background
The total amount of investment of Sichuan Project of The China Qinba Mountains Area
*           Poverty Reduction Project Supported  by the World Bank (Sichuan QBPRP) is 1,494,000,000
RMB. Yuan, of which, the loan of the World Bank is 747,000,1000 RMI yuan (or 90,000,000 USD).
The aim of the project is to reduce the poverty. It will support 12 poor counties and district,
covering the land of 73,501 7 ha with the population of 1,117,664. The Wet group are poorest
farmer households living in the poorest area of the poor counties. The implemetion of this project
*            will benefit to solve the food and clothing problem of poor famers. The project will take an
agretigative approch with multi nput The basic executive ut of the project are special poor
villages of the project area.The 7 comnponents of the project are "Land and FErmer Development",
-Rural Infrastructure", "Rural Entrprises Development", "Labor Mobility", "Rural Micro Credit7,
"Institution Building" '"Project & Poverty Monitoin". The implemenitation of the project plays
a citical role in fufilling "The Province 7-118 Poverty Reduction Plan". It will have remrkable
economic and social benefit.
In accordance with the Enviromnental Protection Law of the people's Republic of China and
Regulations relating to environmental management of construcion projects, enrusted by The Project
*           Management Office of Sichuan Provnce(Province PMO), Sichuan  nstitute of Environmental
Protection (SIEP) undertakes the task of Environmental Inpact Assernment (ETA) of the Sichuan
QBPRP. In the light of the regulations relating to environmental protection of our country, and
requirement of environmnental protection fron the World Bank , Sichuan Ihstitute of Environmertal
protection studies a great number of the basic material concernig this project and combines the
*            original material of the pioject area. We also make the on-the -spot survey, consulted with the
provincial experts and identified the ELA types of the subproject . After doing a great amount of work,
SIEP draws up "The Program of Environmental Impact Assessmnent for ihe Sichuan QBPRP". It has
gone through the exammation of Environmental Protection Bureau of Province and the evaluation of
Envirormental Engieering Center underThe State Environmental Protection Agency.
Apil, 1996, the technical mission for the QBPRP, headed by Mr. Alen Piazza, came to
Sichuan to check the work. Mr. Zhang Chong-hua, the official in charge of the envroment
protection orgaized the examinton and discussion upon "The Prognun of Environmental Impact
*           Assessment for the Sichuan QBPRP". He also gave a demand on making EIA Statenent of the 10
Pilot EIA subprojects selected from 68 subprojects of the component of " Rural Enterprises" and
"Land and Farmer Development" and on overall report
This report is drawn up basing upon "The Program of vironmental Impact Assessment for



.
China QBPRP-Environmental Impact Statment
the Sichuan QBPRP", the opwnons of the State Environmental Plrotectoni Aency and Memorandum
of the World Bank Technology Mission. The Statement of Pilot EIA sub project shows more detailed
envionmental impact of the project and mitigton measures.
After taking survey on-the-spot, studying materials, analysis of data,, public interiew and
consultation with exprs, and hard work of SIEP, the lilA report of this project are shiow you here.
*           We are heartily hankful to the Provincial Environmental Protection Bueau and PMO at Provincial
and county levels as well as relevant Administrative Departmen: and loxal resource persons for their
support and help in the course of drawig up the report.

*           given to the townships having market-fair function.
2.3 Development Strategy and Planning
(1)    Development Strtegy:
The basic strategy are comprehensive approaches and  investment  through various
x           channels and sustainable development . Priority are given to the sub-project of gsin-production and
cash earning oriented activities . Then giving the priority to solvre the problems which is blamed by
most poor, such as the well and water pond construction for drinring water.
To solve food shortage problems in mountain area3, techniques for food production
*           increasing will be usedc there such as terrace making, irrigation levelopLng, improved strains of seed
introducing, plastic covering for corn cultivation and multiple crop index. To increasing short-tern
benefits to local people, livestock and cash trees and surplus labor earn money off farm will be
effective in the area. At the same time, To develop resources of tlhe long term incomes, non fresh fruit
trees and medical tree are recommended.
*                   To the hill areas, key efforts should be highlighted t) improfv the low & middle yields
paddy for solving food problem.
At the same time raising more pigs and domestic fowls and more fruits. Enlarge labor
mobility and strengthen the towm-ship and village enterpnses(TVEs).
*=                  To have a stable and long term benefits for local people there are tow ways could be taken
too, in there as labor migration and rural enterprise developments. To solLve the problem of drinking
water shortage in the project vilLages, number of wells, water ponds and irrigation projects will be
made in there. To enhance abilities of people for against drought and flood, water channels, dams and
_           -lvwater ponds will be built in there. To make better condition on communication and energy supply in
the project area  through rural roads electronic wire constructions.  The land and farner
development should pay attention to the balance of land, water resource, soil fertilizer and the
balance of labor forces.
*                   (2)    Principles of Projects Selection
(a) The selection of sub-projects should be closely connected with the 4 objectives
and  having resource advantages and market demand and able to help solve the feeding and
clothing problems of the local poor and focus on increasing the income of the farmers get
them free from poverty or to become well off.
(b) Projects should based on local conditions.
The poorest farmers must be involved in the project. To encourage poor famers choose
project for themselves. The projects should help local farrrmers increasing production capacity
sustainablely. Pay attention to the activities which especially suitable to the women. Encourage rural
women to carry out small scale animal or poulty raising, mulberry growing and silkworm
breeding ,manual knitting or weaving and others.
HIillside fields should be pay back to develop forestry, pomiculture ard husbandry, when
slope more an 25 degree.
Design two kinds of project: one is for earning of shorlt term incomes ( diversified economy
*           and husbandry ) and another is for earning of long-term sources of incomes ( fruit trees and
13



China QBPRP--Environmental Impact Statement
pomiculture), so that poor farmer can be lift out of poverty stable.
Design two kinds of household model for gett  rid of poverty, according to  the
different characteristics of mountain areas and hilly areas.
To reduce the risks of the poor farners, encouraging households take diversified activities.
v           At the same time, help the farmers with training of practice technologies, extension support.
The projects selected should have active effects on the ecologica[ enviroument. Especially to
the TVEs, deleted all projects which will cause serious pollution.

(7) lMicro Rural Credit:
The direct cost of the micro rural credit component is 1,258,052 yuan, accounts for
1. I 1% of direct cost of total project. The target group is organized in farmer groups by free
*           willing of the farmers. Each group will be composed of five farmer-households. And each 6
groups will form a central group which will be responsible for the delivery and repaving of the
loans. Micro credit takes the poorest farmers who have business ability but lack necessary
starting funds for its cash earning. The activities supported by micro credit could be in forms
of crop-growing and animal-raising or small transport, small trade, small restaurants, In a
*           word the activities of low cost and quickly benefit. The experience of loan operation of rural
micro credit may be extended to the management of poverty reduction loan in China.

on the average. The annual rainfall of the project area is 1,1 00 -  1,252 mm. The inversion
layer of temperature are often appears, which is of special significance for the local crops and
economic woods. Ihe crops are focused mainly on the places 800m below sea level. In the
zones l:Ot:.no  above the sea level, the low temperature. rain2ng days in autusmn and flood affect
greati the growing of crops. The zones 1 .000nm above the sea level are suitable for the growth
of tea- forest and grass.

big or small with an annual volume of 15.9 billion cubic meters of which 4.16 billion cubic
meters can be utilized. However, the water-volume is unevenly distributed in the vear with the
rainfall concentrated in June - September (accounting for 60-70C%  of the whole year).In
March--lav which is the seaso n when much water is needed, the ,rainfall only accounts for
I 5-2i3% 01' that of the whole year ( See table 3-2 I.The capacity of water conservancies is weak;
the seasonal drau,ht affects greatlv the electricity-generation as well a's the agricultural
productinn.

33.3 Noise
Because ol industries are not developed in project areas, the main sources of noise is
*            the vehicles on the road. But because of shortage of road, the environment noise can meet 0
class standards of "The National Noise Standards of Urban Environment" (GB3096-93), that
is under 50 dB dur:wng daytime and under 40 dB at night. Noise of the towsn3 with high density
population can meet the second level. Noise of the center cities, such as Nanchon, Dachuan
and Guangyuan, etc.., can meet the 2-3 class standards( see Table 3-5).

46 65% respectively.
*                  (4) The natural population growth rate of the project area is 0.62%.
3.4.2 Infrastructures
(1) The project villages linked by rural road are 643, 53% of the total project villages.
However, the highways are very poor and often blockecl by rains. The; villages without
highways are mostly located in the mountains and the living necessities are transported only
by manual means. The backwardness in communications and transportation has suffered local
farmers.

*                   (4)    By 1995, there were still 276,395 people and 267,368 livestock whose
drinking water problem was unsolved in the project area.
3.4.3 Education. Healthand Extension Services
(1) Education: the primary education network has formed in the project counties. The
*           schools were primarily equipped with necessary tools or instruments. Thus having created
basic schooling facilities for the children. In 1994 teachers in the project area numbered 7,192,
of which  1,897 serves at junior middle schools, 5,292 serves at lover primary school. The
children of schooling age in the area are 150,102 of which 133,509 are enrolled, the, rate being
0           82.32%. the rate of primary school graduates are 77.22%. Primary education has laid a fairly
good foundation for the future education and cultivation of tCle childxen.
(2) Hlealth:
Medical networks are not well established at both the village and the township level.
Village doctors are seriously lacking and their outflow is heavy. There are 2.5 medical
a           personnel per 1,000 people on the average. The hospital beds per 1,000 people is 1.25 on the
average at county level, but only 0.55 in the project townships. Medical funds are seriously
lacking; medical centers and treatment rooms are badly equipped. Health education is weak
and the people's masses lack health-care consciousness. In 1994  the death rate of pregnant
women was 3.05 9o4; the infant mortality was 64.32 %o ;, The rate of new method baby delivering
was 58.47%; the incidence of high fluorine 15.23 94c; and incidence of iodine deficiency
87.09%-
(3)  Scientsftc Services: Of the 821,000 people at the age of 16-50, and 144,341 are
illiterate, the rate being 16.27%. Of the illiterates women illiterates account for 62% and their
own illiteracy rate is 37.2%. The technical personnel of the project area are 1,159 of which
80% are working at the county level; The technical service units are 379 cctnsisting of  141
agricultural technology stations, 129 livestock stations, 7 crop protection stations, 57
mulberry and silkworn stations, 13 tea and fruit stations, 32 mating/ breeding stations.
e            3.4.4 Azricultural Products
(1) Grain Production: In 1993--1995 the sown area of tle agriculitural crops of the
project area was averagely 10,197.34 ha, of which the sown area of grain was 105,332.71 ha.
The total grain output was 341,057.53 tons with the -unit output being 3.24 T/lia.
(2) The Production of Economic Crops and Other Crops: Thie economic crops of the
project area mainly are oil crops, vegetables, tea, tobacco, medicinal materials and fruits,
whose sown area is 18,624 hectares.
(3) The forest land area is 160,259.6 hectares; the forest coverage is 27.9%; and the
per-capita orchard is 0.002 hectares.
*                   (4)  Animal Husbandry: By the end of 1995 the per-capita livestock in the project
area was 0.12 big animal, 0.55 pig, 0.07 sheep and 1.18 chickens on the average. The
grassland which can be utilized is 87,904 hectares.
(5) The machine cultivated land of the project area is 145.41 hectares, being 0.02% of
the total cultivated land. The annual electricity-consumption per hectare of land is 384.76

3. 4.5 Rural Enterprise
The gross output of the township enterprises of the project counties 132.97 million
yuan with the per-capita output valuing 114.7 yuan, of which the value of rural industry
. *          output is 31.612 million yuan, the per-capita value being 27.27 yuan..
3.5 The Quality of living
(1) The local faner live in the backward mountain area and suffered with food and cloth
problem, drinking water problem, poor traffic and communication, frequent natul catastrophe such
as drought, floodirg, low temperature. Another problem is the lack of educational and health
facilities, and they have no money for their preliminary social senices.
4. Environmental Impact and the Mitigating Measures.
4.1 Identilication of influential factors and Assessment Category
According to the experts consultation, the possibie influence factors and influence intensity
of the individual subproject were identified. Then, the categories of EIA was deltrmined after
*i           discussed with provLnce environmental protection bureau. Table 4-1 list the maim environmental
influence intensity and ELA categories identified.
From table we can see, all subprojects of component "labor mobility", "institution Building7,
aproject and poverty monitoring", "rural m'cro credit" have no adverse inpact on environtment. Most
subprojects of "Land and farmer development", "rural infrastructure" have only few or no adverse
G           impact. They are profitable to local ecological environment or they are soil ani water consevation
subproject themselves. They belonge to category "A' of EL\, that means they don't need ELA
Statement or EIA Form. Part subprojects of the components of "rura enterprises development" have
disadvantageous impact on environment, but they are in a small scale and locate in remote area which
are far away from the center cities with high density population. Therefore, the disadvantageous
impact on environment is not great. They belong to category "C" of EJ0A. They need detailed EIA
analysis and draft EUA Statements. More han half of subprojects of comniponent of "rural enteiprises
develepnent5' and some of "land and farmer development", 'rural infrastructure" have relatively
environment impact, they need to fill ETA Forms.

4.2 EIA Anadysis of Rural Enterprises
4.2.1  The Determination of The Pilot EIA Suproecs
Th e rural enterprlses can be devised into II groups. The possible environmental impact
-             identified by the experts consultation are listed in Table 4-2. For detai ed ETA analysis, we choose
*            the relatively representative 8 pilot enterprises to make detailed environmitetal impact assessment (see
Table 4--2 and appendix 4-12).
Table 4-2 shows that the enterpnses group include  minimg and construction matenal
processing, agricultural products and by-products processig fodder processing, livestock products
*            processing  and forest products processing, etc. But all of them ar irn a small scale. The possible
large disadvantageous impact are livestock products processing and forest produets processin& the
next ones are agiculural products and by-products processing, fruit processig, fodder processing
mining and constuction materials. In order to evaluate and analysis the impact on environment, to
study the mitigation measnures for disadvantageous irmpact and plan of envircmmental control and
monitoring and management durng operation, we choose the relatively representative 8 rural
enterprises(pilot subprojects) to make detailed environmental impact ascssment. The nral
enterprises are Cingxi Fruit-tea Processing Plant, ialing District Jirfto Veumiceei Mill, Yilong
Yellow Wine factory, CarigK Shale Bnrck Processing, Wangcang County Meat Processing Mill,
*            Xuanhan County Furfural Factory, Jialing Carburetant Factory  and Toniang Forest Products
Processing Factory.

The evalu&tion result can, be seen in Table 4-3 and Appendix 4-12.Tongjiang Forestry
Chemicals Factory and Xuanhan Furfiral Factory have great impact on environment among these
nural enterprises. These two subprojects have been chosen to make detailed aialysis of the typical
cases study in this Statemenit (see chapter 5).
4.2.3 Conclusion of Environmental impact Assessment of Rur] Entprise
Some results are got from the environmental assessment on pilst subproedts and analysis of
cases, the results are as follows:
The subproject will have some negative impacts on the environment in the period of
*            construction and operatiorn, but it doesn't affect enviironment heavily and can be reduced to the
permissible the environment throug 'three wastes" utilization and disposal aS well as environmental
monitoring supervision and management. So the construction of the project is feasible in term of
environmental protection; Meanwhile, it is noted that the negtive im,rpact of the subproject of the
national sandards or provincial ones if no control measures are taken. At that time, environmental
pollution will occur in the local area. Some urban pollution sources will transfer to the rual area,
spreading a large area.
We announce some notes as follows: These small-sized poverty reduction subprojects
*            supported the World Bank must obey the State environmental management procedure for

*            construction and it3 relevant laws and regulations, implement the systern of "the three at the same
time", that is, pollution control facilities and the mnain project will bte clesigned, consltucted and put
into operation at the same time; Carrv out environ-mental monitoring plan. carefl2ily during the period
of the subproject construction and production, accept the enviwronental supervision and management
of environmental protection authorities at different levels and neet te requirements of total quatity
*            control of pollutant discharge. Eliminate potential pollution in the roduction process as far as
possible, select gractually the relevant technologies and norms of cleaner production, raise the
utilization ration of resource and energy, and reduce the load of finml treatient. The subprojects
construction shouli meet the requireme-nts of environmental protection from betinning to end, and
thus coordirating deveiopment between local economic development and environmental protection
will be achieved.
4._ .4 Important Measures for Pollution
Total Control Pollutant Discharge for Rural Enterprises.
*                    It is proved by practice that implementing total quantity control of pcllutant discharge is a
general trend of achieving enviromnental objective as well as guaranteeing and improving
enivironmental quality, and it is one of the effective ways to reduce is-vestment and utilize
environmental capacity reasonably. The project area is located in the poverty area with undeveloped
local industry, so thie impact of individual subproject an local air environMnent ari water environment
is small for their small polluta.t quantity and scattering location. In order to prevert the potential
pollution the total q-antity will be adopted control as the important nmcasure in the environmental
management of the subproject implementation. According to the concrete conditions of rural
enterprses, the determination of total quality control measures is as follows:
_                  (] )Based on analysis and comprehensive consideration of local environmental objective,
economic development, finncial capacity , treatnent technology etu., each county will set up
gradually a permit system of pollutant discharged which takes the tota quantity control as a core.
(2)Rural enterprises must obey and implement the national or local pollutant dischage
stdards and the `tle three at the samne time" system of capital conmstrutiorn. ensure and increase
*             ilnvestment for environmental protection. Pollutant discharge muist cop`y with the relevant
(3)Newly-builo and extension projects must control the existing pollution source of the old
factory to meet the demands that the total quantity of pollutant discharged will not exceed the
existing one.
40,               (4)The factories locWation should be selected carefully and disisIlbuted reeasnably to make the
pollutant discharge to be in the permissible limit total quantity control without pollution to the local
environment.
(5)Cany out the cleaner production, use foreig'  advanced process technology and pollution
control technology to reduce the pollutant discharge quantity t, the lowest level.
*                 (6)Firmly implemrent "Stipulations of the States Council on Somie Problems of Environmental
Protection" and the local evnvironmental protection bureau's stipulatiors on concelliri& closing and
stopping production to the "five-small" enterprises. Adjust industrial structure, regulate pollutant
discharge quantity in the project area. Develop the industries, with less pollution or without pollution
so as to control the total quantity of pollutant discharged in the project area to be in the permissible
*             limit of the total quantity control on the basis of the local conditions.

*           4.3  Environmental l pad  Analysis of Land  and  farmer IDevelopment and Rural
Infrastrucure Conslruction
The objective of the subproject is in the following: Resolve the problems of the destroyed
ecological balancet .in the mountainous and hilly &reas, severe soil erosion and low output of gain
which were caused by the means of the local people's triditional productive method, such as
destroying forest and reclaiming wasteland etc.. In order to imjprove litdn con(itions and settle the
basic requirements of the mountain area people, soil and war conservation and the balance of water,
soil and fertilizer are all considered in the design of the subproject.
4.3.1 Determination of the Environmental Assssment for Pilot ViMUPS
The subproject of land and farmer development ard raral fifstrutue constrmtion is
mostly a comprehensive poverty reduction subproject implemented in a yillage in the meantime. Each
project village's objective and content for poverty reduction will be drawn uli oDn the basis of its
natural conditions and resource, so each project village has its different objective an(d content, and
has different technical level of scale and requirement. In order to find out Lhe impact of the
subprojects on the enviromnent, plannig of poverty reduction sind development for two pilot villaes,
which can represert rural mountainous area and hilly area respectively, were selected to cary out
envirormental analysis according to the difference of topography. A pilot village, Luopo Village,
Nongquanr Township, Xiuanhan County was selected to be the representtive of mountaius for
people (such. as, shortages of water and cultivated land, low culture or education, big difference of
altitue, large slope, inconvenient trafric and communication Otc..), poor environmental quality for
living. So the first step for poverty reduction is to solve th; problerms of drnking water, gran
3            enducation and health, fundamental traffic and communication etc., and to improve basic living
conditions gradually; then increase the mvestment for sciencx and technoloMr and constrict some
ecological subprojects in mountain area. Farmers living in the area urge to get rid of poverty and
doesn't want to move to other places, so it is imperative to develop economy, raise, living quality and
educational level based on local conditions. The poor famers sire willing to participate the activities
to protect forest vegetation and won't do harmfil to the environment if educating them some
knowledge about environmental science. Seeing that the sublroject irmplemertation is urgent and
feasible. During the penod of subproject implementation, some 5ihinS shlould be considered and paid
attention to: Pay attention to environmental monitoring and mmagemnent, mitigate soil erosion as far
*            as possible, increase vegetation area and protect local forest; Iromote grdually the development of
ecological agriculture in mountainous area with a diversified economy, of which forestry is a key part
and while Chinese traditional herbal medicine and economic forest, are important backbones.
Another pilot village, Shen Maoya Village. Shiyarg Township, Jiling District is the
*            representative of the poverty reduction villages in hilly area. where the population is dense and
multriplanting rate is high (>184%.). Although its trffic, communication and infornmation conditions
are better than those in mountainous area, it is still under the poverty line of our coxntry with its
shortages of water and cultivated land, low owing grain and low net income per persn. The poverty
reduction plannmg doesn't only resolve the problem of the basic living conditions of poverty
reduction villages, but increases scientific and technological contairnment, that is to say we should
34



.
China QBPRP--Environmental Impact Statement
solve the problem of water shortage, and also raise labor value, go through the way of saving water,
*               saving energy and being rich by science and technology, rise the grade and level of development for
poverty reduction gradually. It is necessary to cooperate with the relevant research institutes and
universities still further to develop efficient rural enterprises and planting raising professional
households; Popularize fine species, advanced technology and installations for planting, raising and
cultivation, set up an integrated management and advanced agricultural system, strive for building
*               demonstration villages of sustainable development agricultural ecology (Table 4-4).
4.3.2 Environmental  pact Analysis of the Component of Land and Farmer oqviepmnent
Impact analysis of the construction of pilot villages of poverty reduction on the environment
is show in Table 4-5, 4-6 and Appendix 4-9, 4-10.
According to the analysis of environmental assessment, it is clear that these subproject's
objective is to stable resolve the problems of adequate food and clothing for poor farmers as well as
income sources in the project area with an aim of poverty reduction. Create conditions for the
sustainable development of social and economic environment in the project area improve ecological
e               environment of agriculture and perfect infrastructure, raise the local people's consciousness and
capability of exchanging or communication to the outside world.
The key point of the subproject of land and farmer development is as follows:
Comprehensively utilize the resource unexploited waste slopes which can be used for developing
forest, fruit tree planting and animal grazing; develop economic crops and fruit-forestry, raise the
peasants' income and in the meantime increase vegetation covering rate so as to, mitigate soil erosion
and achieve balance of water; and promote the output of median and low farmlands through the
applying practical technologies such as seed preparation fine species popularization and scientifical
*              fertilizer application etc. to increase gain yield and enhance the capability of self-sufficient im gain.
Develop animal husbandry to ensure a stable income of farmer households, provide sufficient and
good quality organic fertilizer or manure, improve soil quality and increase gain output, build
irrigation systems to resolve the problems of shortage of drinking water and irrigation water, and
create a good cycle of agricultural ecological system in the subproject area. So, the implementation of
*              the subprojects is very beneficial to environment.
The negative impact brought by the subproject on the environment is much weaker than its
positive impact. The details can be seen in the follows:
4.3.2.1 Impact on Soil Erosion
The subproject construction will cause soil erosion mainly in the period of land betterment
and infrastructure construction. But ,the situation is only in some area and in a short time, it will
soon end along with the completion of the subproject. The subproject is beneficial to soil and water
*             conservation.
Control measures
(l)In order to avoid the soil erosion caused by subproject construction, the construction
period should be in dry season to reduce the soil erosion caused by rainfall.

4.3.2.2 Imnpact of C.henical Pesticide Aplication on Environment
In order to ensure crop and fruit- forestry's stable and high yield, prevent and cure plant
diseases and insect pests, and control the negative impact of other harnftil organisms to crop, some
quantity of pesticide is needed, such as insecticide, acadiide and weed killer etc.. Pesticides have
some toxicity so it may contaminate the environment in var    degrees if its usage exceeds
environmental self-purification capacity. When spraying pesticides, some inme drop of practical of
*            pesticide will suspend in the air, being harmnful to the human and animals. Pesticides will deteriorate
water qualitv and contatninate aquatic organisms and sediment when aocumulatiig the water body.
Soil will be contamnmatd if applyi  exceedi  pesticides on (specially high toxic or high residue).
Crops will be poisoned because of biological enrichment. Pesticides may come int) human body by
food-chain through the.r enrichment in aquatic organisms and crops, then they are enriched again in
*             1human body resulting in chromic poisoning,
C ontrol measures
(1) Care must be taken to labor protection. Making prescfiptiorn and spraying of pesticide
must strictly comply with the relevant regulations. Great care mLst be taken to higl toxic pesticides
when applying.
(C2)Use pesticides with proper amount and time, take care of lie safe period of applying
pesticides to crops. Don't apply them in harvest time, pesticides with hi 'i toxicity and high residue
must be used with great care.
(3)Monitor dr.nking water quaity, pool water quality and pesticide content in agricultural
products and their by-products. Never exceed the standard of peslicide dosage
(4)Popuiarize microbial pesticides, and take the measure of `"isects kiing insects", and
thus reduce the usage of pesticide.
(5)The usage of pesticide must comply with the national standard, "Safe Usage Standard of
*            Pesticide" ( (334285-89) Spray pesticides are used in a day witIout wine or rain. The appliances for
applying pesticides should not be cleaned in natual waters to prevent water polluion. The polluted
water caused by applances cleaning should be created in a safe place. Never use those appliances to
hold agriculual produicts cr other foodstuff. Strerngthn safe education on pesticides to farmers,
popularize relative scientific and technological knowledge. In a word, pesticides should be used
safely, reasonably, econiomically and efficiently.
4.3.2.3  Impact of ahemical. Fertilizer Application on Environenant
Applyig cherical fertilizer reasonably can ensure meet the demands of crop to nutTition
*            elements. but it can make soil harden, pollute surface water or groundwater if it isn't used properly.
Especially, a large quantity of N/P in soil will n off into water body and other enviromnent to caus
vanous kinds of environmental protblems when N..1P fiterlizers are exceedingly used.
Control mreasures

China QBPRP-Environmental Impact Statement
*            the basis of soil quality and the demands of crop to nutrition elements. It is sirmctly prohibited to
abuse chemical fertilizer.
(2)Strongly develop green manure, increase the usage of farm manure to decrease the usage
of cherical fertili7zr gradually.
3)Pod-beaning plants have a function of nitrogen fixation, wfich ccan raise the accumlation
of nitrogen in soil and increase fertility of soil. It is suggested to intermrop bean ciltures such as been,
pea, mung bean and soybean, etc. or superior been feed (such as, Lucerne, Chin,-s milk vetch, etc.)
while growing corn and potato with high yield in order to reach the goal of using and maintaining
fields, reducing the usage of chemical fertilizer and ensuring high yield of grain crop.
*                    (4)Monitor the water quality of drinking water and tlhe water quality of farmland runoff
which is from fields down to water body at regular intervals.
4.3.2.4  The IMDact of Plastic Much for   iulte on Environment
Plastic mulch can rise temperature, promote crop's metabolism and move up mature period
*            of crop. Meanwhile, using the membrane, the evaporation of soil moisture will be dereased and the
utilization rate of moisture is over 80%. So it has a function of maintaining soil moistre. The
membrane is favorable to the organic matter's solution in soil, and can inca.eE= active nutrients of
soil, improve the physicochemical properties of soil, reduce hardlened soil and voiume weight of soil
and control weed growth in ihe fields.
The negative Uimpact of plastic mulch is: Its long time after, thLe membrane residue will do
harmful to the growth of root system, decrease grain yield, affect permeation of rain water into soil,
which may make water flow together to cause soil erosion. It is disdvantageDus to improving
e            physical and chemical properties of soil. The membrane remaining in the fields will affect the
ventilation and permeation properties of soil, hamper the growth of root system and its absorption of
nutrients and moisture, and result in yield reduction and white pollution tu the environment.
Control measures
(l)Popularize the mneans of scavenging the memnbrane residue by hand. 3ut Lhe method can
not eliminate the contamination of the membrane to soil and water body totally, so it is not the best
way for the membrane scavenging.
(2)Gradually extend the membrane of photochemical degradation and orginism degadation
*             to decrease of eliminate the contamination of the memtrane to soil. It is an advanced and prctical
technology which spreads home and abroad in recent years. It must be publicized. and aJopted in the
subproject.
*             4.4 Risk Analysis
Tne subprojects belong to the World Bank's soft loan project of poverty reduction with long
term and low mterest. Tney were determninate on the basis of discussiore between the people in the
poverty area and village and township govements, as well as the conditions of tfe local resources
and environment, the poverty households' willing and requiremenms, and the demonstration of

(I)The subproject of land and farmer development can improve and increase the quality and
quantity of cultivated and, raise the yield of grain, economic crop, frit forest and raising and
increase farmers' net income and grain ration;
*                   (2)The subproject or rural enterprises development can greatly rise the value of agricultural
products, and increase farmers' gain ration and income;
(3)The subproject of labor mobility may create employment oppo:rtunties for surplus labor
force, enhance infomnation change and increase the poverty farmer househoolds' income;
(4)The subproject of social service and rural infrastructure construction will improve the
*           basic living conditions and living quality of the farmers in the subproject. arleas;
(5)The subproject of rural small amnount of loan can provide the niecessan, circulating funds
for the poverty farmer households to develop production;
(6)The subproject of poverty monitoring and project monitoring will increase the
containment of science and technology in poverty reduction work, and they are the key or factors for
the normal operation of the project under the conditions of that not to do harmful to the environment,
not to destroy resource and not to reduce technical level;
(7'IThe subproject of istitution construction is the important guartee for the normal
implementation of the project.
These subprojects will be carried out under the leadership of the project offices of the State,
province and county etc., and directly produce econonmic benefit, social benefit and environmental
benefit to the poverty villages and the poverty farmer households. Seeing that, thie subprojects will
not have major risk- and accidents as a whole. Individual subproject or rome subprojects may have
*            some problems or can rot achieve the expected objectives in a period of tune, but those problems can
be solved through the coordinating management of project offices at diffierent levels and our efforts
during a relative long time. People from all directions of the project area have a strong confidence to
the project.
According to the motioned content of 4.2 and 4.3, the negative envirorurental impact of the
project is weaker than the positive one . The negative impact can be reduced or eliminated by men to
meet the local environmental requirements. In addition. each subprojects has its environmental
monitoring and management plan, So, the project has not major ri.sk in environment.
5. Case Study
5.1 Case One:
*                    3,4,5-trimethoxy benzaldehyde production in The Tongjiang Chemical Plant
5. 1.  Technical Processing
The proposed sub-project is one of the sub-projects of the China Qinba Mountainous
Poverty Reduction Project supported by the World Bank. Tongjiang Chemical Plant of Forest
Products is planned to locate in Tongjiang Township, Tongriang County. The plant will utilize
41



.
China QBPRP--EnvironmentaI !mpact Statement
gallnut. which are abundant in the locality, to produce 3,4,5-trimethoxy benzaldehyde (TMBA) for
pharmaceutical industry as a raw material.
The subproject is built on the basis of existing Tongjiang Chemical Plant of Forest Products.
The products include tannic acid, trimethoxv benzene formhydrozide(TBF) and TMBA
The production capacity for TMBA is I OOT/yr- The major engineering is to built a new TBF
*             workshop and a new TMBA workshop.
The sub-project uses gallnut as raw material to produce TMBA, i.e.,use gallnut to produce
tannic acid, and then use tannic acid to produce TBF, and fmnally use TBF to produce TMBA The
flow sheet of the technological process is methyl etherification -  hydrozation -  electrolytic
oxidation.
(1). Process of Methylation,Hydrotysis and Esterification
After pulverizing, gallnuts are soakled in water. after the solution with tannic acid is
evaporated, concentrated and dried, the finished product is powdery tannic acid which is one of the
subproducts of the subproject. If the final product is TBF, the solution with tannic acid goes directly
into the next process --* the process of methyl etherification to produce trimethoxy benzoate
(ester).The flow sheet is shown in Figure 4-1.
(2). Process of Hydrazation
Under certain conditions ,ester reacts chemically with hydrazine hydrate to become TBF.
e             The flow sheet is shown in Figure 5-1.
(3). Process of Oxidation
Using methylbenzene as solvent and yellow prussiate of potash as oxidizer ,TBF
electrolytically oxidates to become the final product, TMiBA The flowsheet is shown in Figure 5-2.
*             5.1.2  Pollutant Discharge and Its Control
(1). Wastewater
The most sensitive problem the sub-project brings about is water pollution. Through
material balance, we can find out that the production doesn't need much water. Although the total
effluent from the production is 50 T/T(product)(including production waste water and water in the
raw material), the components of the effluent are very complicated, such as demethyl sulfuric ester,
hydrazine hydrate, suspended solids, and some acidic or alkaline materials. The remained ester and
added subsidiary materials which are drained into the water body are harmful to aquatic organisms.
0* aHydrazine hydrate is stable in groundwater and reducing agent is harmful to human beings. Therefore
the effluent must be treated before discharge.
There are some treatment measures available for the effluent. First,the wastewater from
esterification goes into recovering tank and add acid in it to recover 3,4,5-trimethoxy benzoate. After
recovering, the wastewater flows into an integrated wastewater treatment system. Secondly, the
wastewater from acylhydrazination is treated by adding acid to recover hydrazine sulfate and by
adding alkali to recover hydrazine hydrate. After that,the pretreated wastewater flows into the
integrated treatment system.

Thirdly, the wastewater from oxidation is treated to recover yellow prussiate of potash which
then is incinerated, the pretreated wastewater flows into the integrated treatment system. Secondary
biological oxidation process is used in the integrated wastewater treatment system. After being
treated, the effluent, which can meet the Integrated Discharge Standard of Sichuan Province, is
drained into Xiaotongjiang River. The flowsheet of the treatment process is shown in Figure 5-3.
(2). Waste Gas
Some methanol vapor during the production process and some dust in the crushing process
of gallnut are generated .To solve the problem, a suction cap is used to collect the methanol vapor,
which can be used for adding the wind of the boiler. Methanol becomes water and carbon dioxide by
oxidizing in the boiler. Both of them are not hanrful to the environment. The dust produced by
crushing gallnut can be collected by bag-type dust collector. The collected dust can be soaked for
extracting tannic acid, so the dust emission concentration of the process is cut down to =< 0.3 mg/m3.

Smoke dust emitted from 6 t boiler has a great influence upoxi the atmosphere.The boiler
will bum local coal which has low sulfur content, usually under 1B and the highest 1.5%, but its ash
content is relative high, us.ally 35%. If the steam rate is 4.5 tt, a ton of coal will be burmed every
*               hour. The emission rates of smoke dust and SO2 are 135 mg/rn3 and 16 kjVh respectively.
45



.
China QBPRP-Envronmental Impact Statement_
A 30m stack and a dust collector with dust collection efficiei cy over 95% are used. The
smoke dust concentration and emission rate can meet the Emission Stanlard of Siciuan Province.
(3). Waste Residue
Waste residues generated by the project are mainly organic resiidue from gallnut and coal
X            cinder. Organic residue can be mixed with coal as fuel. Coal cinder an be used as bicknaking
material for some brick-field nearby, Such waste can be easily treated in local place owing to small
amounlt
(4). Noise
Noise mostly comes from machinery,such as air compressor, pwup acusher, boilerblower and
*             so on- The sound intensity of sources is between 80-90 dB(A) After sound deadening, the noise in
the workshop can meet The National Noise Standard For Industrial Enterprises. The factotr must
carry out The Nationai Labor Hygienic Standard at the wvorking posts where noise source exists. The
noise at factory's boundary can meet The Environmental Noise Standard of Mixed Area. As the
factory covers a wide area, noise sources can't influence the environment through rational layout of
strong sources.
To sum up%,there are some wastewater, waste gas, waste residue and noise during the
production process. After treatment, the discharge or emission of wastewater,waste gas and noise can
meet the national or local standards. The discharge or emissionl amount. of the pollutants has been
taken into consideration in the plan of total amount control of pollutants. Since the amount of waste
residue is relative small, it can be easily treated or disposed. So all the Fctors which can impact the
environment can be controlled. Moreover, some pollution control measures have been considered in
the designs of the sulb-proj ect- Those measures are reasonable, feasible anid practical.
5.1.3  Prediction of the nimpat on Ecoical Environent
(1). Prediction of the Impact on Forest:
The sub-project is to produce chemicals by processing gallnut. gallnut is a gall fonned by a
d             parasitic aphid on the leaves of gailtree. The tree is the fist host of p&naase,while moss is the second
host of paratise. The aphid and the two hosts form a special ecological balance system. These aphids
don't have negative impact on other species of tree and they are hamfW to human beings and crops.
The sub-project will surely promote the planting of galltrees and increase the variety of forest
structure. The implementation of the sub-project has a good influence upon forest ecology.
(2). Prediction of the Impact on Water Environment
The subproject has both positive and negative impacts on water evironment. Firstit
promotes gall tree planting and thus can conserve water and mitigate soil erosion. Secondly, the
implementation of the sub-project will produce some pollutant which is drained into water body. It is
hanrmful to the q'uality of water body. The design of the sub-project has taken this problem into
consideration. The pollutant will be recovered. The integrated effluent m-ust be treated by primary and
secondary biological oxidation processes. The treated wastewater can mieet the relevant dischrge
standard of Sichuan province- Before the construction of the subproject, the existing  primary
*             utilization of gallnut. also has water pollution problems. Being short of finds, the pollution wasn't
brought under control. After the in mplementation of the subproject, all the pollution problems, old and
46



China QBPRP--Environmental Impact Statement
new, can be solved with special fund. Puting the sub-project into effect is good for water
environment protection and promotes the prevention and control of water pollution in the sub-project
area. The water quality of the water body can meet the national requirements of category m of
standard.
(3). Prediction of the Impact on Atmospheric Environment
The main air pollutants produced by the sub-project are methanol , hydrazine hydrate, dust,
S02 and so on. A number of measures of treating and controlling the pollutants are considered.
Methanol vapor can be oxidized by burming, while hydrzine hydrate vapor which has strong
*            reducibility can be oxidized in the air .Their fmal products after oxidation are both harmless. The
dust can be collected by dust collector and comprehensively utilized. The residual dust and SO2 go
into the air through a 30m stack, meeting the emission standard of atmospheric pollutants of
Sichuan Province. All of the measures are reasonable and feasible. The local air quality is relative
good,so some emission of TSP and SO2 has little impact on the air quality.
5.1.4 Accident Analysis
The subproject dose not have the possibility of explosion. The possible accidents are the
failure of methanol vapor treatment facility, dust collector,or hydrozine hydrte recoverer. When the
failure of metianol vapor treatment happe  ,the factory must stop the production at once. When the
dust collector fails, two measures can be taken: If the weather condition is good, decrease the
production and repair the collector inmmediately; If the weather condition is bad,stop the operation of
boiler right away. After repairing the collector, then start the operatatio of boiler again. When the
recoverer of hydrazine hydrate fails, the wastewater must be stored temporarily, direct discharge or
3            flowing into the treatment system of integrated wastewater is not absolutely allowed. So hydrazine
hydrate recovery system must have certam store capacity.
In general, all the accidents can be controlled and they don't have any negative impact on
the environment.
*            5.1.5  Conclusion and Suggestions
In the view of environmental protection, the sub-project is feasible. We suggest that during
the implementation of the sub-project, environmental monitoring and management must be
strengthened, cleaner product audit should he done, and the environmental monitoring plan and
*            environmental impact assessment plan must be camied out so as to put all the pollution control
facilities into effect.
5.2 Case Two: Xuanhan Furfural Plant
*             5.2.1  Technical Procesig
The proposed sub-project is to build a new factory, in the 1.5knm away, northwest of the
Town of Xuanhan County. It uses husks of rice and cotton seed and comcob as raw material to
produce firfural. The process of production includes crushing, hydrolyzing in reaction tank,
firactionating, dewatering, etc. The following Flowsheet 5-4 gives it in detail.

5.2.2  Ana lsis of Pollutant Discharge
(1).Wastewater
The wastewater of the sub-project consists of two parts. The first part is the acidic
wastewater coming out from the dewatering tower. Among it, the contents of BOD5,COD. and SS are
*4           low ( Because the product, furfural, is the oil layer of the surface). After neutralizing with line, the
pH is 6.6-7.5. After precipitating and filtrating, the water quality can meet the relevant discharge
standard. Their standard values are BOD5 <= 60mg/I, COD<- 15Omg/l and SS<=- 150mg/l
respectively. If this part of wastewater can be comprehensively utilized, it canlt be drained away on
the whole. The second part of wastewater is the cooling water of facilities and the ash-washing water
of the boiler, containing acids and suspended solids .The water can be used as recycled cooling water
after treatment. If producing a ton of furfural discharges 5 ton of wastewater, the wastewater amount
of the sub-project is 2500 tons per year. In addition, there are some domestic water and other water
for planting and clearing in the factory, totally 50n3/d or so.
48



China QBPRP--Environmental Impact Statement
*                    (2). Waste Gas
The wast gas mainly comes fom a 4t/h coal-fired boiler. Undler the condition of full-scale
operation, the coal/gas ratio is 1 4.5, so the coal consum-rption is O.8Sth. The main pollutants in the
flue gas and their emission rates are as follows:
SO0Q : 28 kg/b ( S content calculated by 2%)
Smoke dust: 4.0 kg/h (dust and dust collection efficiency caculated by 23% and 90%,
respectively)
(3). Waste Residue
*                    There are a lot of waste residue generated in the production of furfural. WVhen I ton of
furfural is produced, 8-14 tons residue (accounting for 60-75%/6 of raw material)  will be discharged.
Accordi-ng to the calculation, the discharged residues of the  sab-project is about 4,000 t to 7,000 t
per year. The lini in the residue is about 60-70%. Besides ligrin, there are litle potassium sulfate,
nitrogen, phosphorus and etc. According to the flowsheet of Figure 5-15, The discharged residue is
- mainly tei pressed residue coming from the hydrolyzing pot . Small part of it is coal-fired boiler
cinder. The total residute is estimated at 1,400 ton per year.
(4). Noise
*>                   The noise generates from boiler blower and so on. The sound lev'el is up to 100 dB(A).
5.2.3  Prediction of the Impact of Pollutant Discharge
(1). Waste Gas
*                    The emission rate of atmospheric pollutant of the sub-project canrt meet the relevant
standard. The standard values are: S02 is 14 kg/h and smoke dust is 2.57 kgih. In order to comply
with the standard, the sulfur content of the coal used must be under 0. 9%. The water dust scrubber
must be selected.
The plant is on the northwest of the town of Xuanhan county, about 1-2 km far from the
town center. The surrounding environment is simple There are farmland and wasteland as well as few
famn houses around the plamt. Only Dongxiang grain depot arLd Xuanhan Cournty Town are in the
direction of the prevailing wind, but upwind. So there is no special sensitive spot around the plant.
Therefore the emissioI of dust and S32 can not affect the protected places notably.
(2). Wastewater
The drained wastewater is about 55 Vid. It is drained into Zhouhe River through a 5 kn
long sewer. Calculated by dilution-degradation model, the predicted result is shown in Table 5-1.

China QBPRP--Enfironnentat Impact Statement
According to the table, we can fmd out that the wastewatr of the sub-proect has little effect
on the water quality of Zhouhe River.
(3). Noise
*                    The noise of the sub-project mainly comes from the boile1r blower. According to the equation
of distance attenuation:
L2 = LI - 20 Lg( r I r2)
where:
L2 -- sound level from source r2
*                 L--- sound level fom source  rI
The relation between distance and nioise attenuation is slhown in Table 5-2 on the basis of
calculation.

After the protection of sound deadening and sound insulation, the maximum sourd intensity
at source is 85 dB(A). 1Here 40 m of attenuation distance is adopted to evaluate the noise level
accordng to the standard values: 65 dB(A) im the daytime and 55 dB(A) at night. The industrial noise
can not disturb the environment out of the plant.
(4). Impact of the Subproject on Vegetation
T7he impact of the sub-proj.ct on vegetation and crops includes two respects.
*                     (a). Impact on vegetation and crops during the sub-prqject conrtruction
Because the site of the plant has altitude difference ( the lowest elevation 325 m, and the
highest 330 m ), the earthwork is hard. Since there is much fannland around dhe plant, crops and
vegetation must be destroyed to a certain extent during the constructiom. After thie constuction. is
completed, such stuation will end.
(b). Impact of Waste Residues on Environrment
The discharged residue of the sub-project is 6,000-8,000 t. There is some cinder (1,400 t/yr)
among it. After being treated, the cinder can be used for bick-making, road paivement, compound
fertilizer and fael. There must be a place to store the cinder, or else it will pollute the w-ater and the
*fi           farmland when it is windy or rainy. Pay attention to the impact of the cinder on the environment
during transportation. Ihere must be fence and shelter for the cinder, meanwhile preparations against
flood and the leakage of the cinder are necessary. Strictly forbid fhe overflow of thte residue to pollute
the environment.

*             5.2.4  Control Measures For Pollutant Discha
(1 ).Waste Residue
The residue generated the subproject is the main polutant. Tlae conventional treatment
imethods to the pollutant are as folloNws:
(a) Uised as a fuel
Being dried 7 the residue can be used as a fuel, and the heat value of one ton equals 0.5-1
ton coal. But it contaills acid and may corrode the equipment.
(b) Producing activated carbon
*                     Activated carbon can be attained by dry distillation, meanwhile l .% acid will be recovered.
(c) Mak-ing compound fertilizer
The residue of abouit 30 tons can produce I ton compound ftSsilizer.The water solution
contains nitrogem phosphorus and potassium etc., which takes foTm of crystal.
(2). Wastewater
The waste liouor containing acid, which comes from the dewaterig tower, is neutralized by
soda ash to produce aqueoiw solution of sodium acetate. The solution is; heated to concentrate by
*             evaporation, then ad-ust its PH  to 6.5-7.0  Then add activated carbon to decolourize the
solutionFinally trikydrous sodium acetate (purity 96%) is formed by filtrating to remove impurities
and cooling to fonrm crvstal. The current price of the product is 1280 yuan!t. The cooling water can be
recycled through neutralization and settling. The recycle rate is 50%la. TIhe dowestic sewage from
donnitonres rising wat er from workshops flow septic tanks, then drains to the sewer.
(3)- Waste Gas
The smok-e dust from  boiler is conventionally dedusted by dust collector. Electric
precipitator has high efflciently in dust collecting (over 99%), but it doesn't suited to the factory for
its high cost Dedusting by granulite water dust scrubbeT is recommended in the project. Generally
speaking, it can get an ideal result (over 95%o) with reasonable design and installation. It can meet the
requirement specified 1b class C of local emission standard of Sichiun Province (DB 51/186-
93).According to the stEndard the peTrmissible emission rate of SC2 is l 4kg/h for 30m stack , Here the
emission rate of smoke dust is 250mg3 equivalent to SO2: 2.5kg/h less than standard.
Coal selecte zas fuel should meet the following requirements:
(a) The sulfur content must be less than 0.9%, uniless the S02 emission rate can not meet the
standard of 14kg/h.
(b) The efficiency of dust collection should be 95%0 in order to the relevant emission
*              standard of 2.S7kgh
(4>A Noise
The  loud no se from blower in boiler room can be controlled by noise abatement and
sound insulation etc. .then its sound level can be lower than 8Sdb(A) specified by Noise Hygienic
Standard of Industrial Enterprises.

China QBPRP--Environmental Impact Statement
*            5-2.5  Conclusion And Suggestions
The construction of the subproject is feasible in term of environmental protection. It is
suggested that the environmental monitoring and assessment should be carried out carefully during
the construction period of the subproject, and the audit for cleaner production will be conducted.
6. Analysis of Environmental Cost and Benefit
The project is the project for poverty reduction and environmental protection which its
positive impact is far more powerful than the negative on in term of environment. Its total benefit is
poverty reduction, environmental protection and sustainable development of local society and
economy. Naturally, its implementation and operation should be monitored and managed. A few
subprojects which may deteriorate the ecological environment or generate "three wastes" will have
*            control measures for 'three wastes" or other mitigating measures for the negative impact. Fixed funds
are needed for the said work. The specific amount of funds will be fixed in the environmental

7.  Environmental Management Plan And Environmental Monitoring And Control Plan
7.1 Environmental Management Plan
7_I ObIective
The proposed project involves 12 counties of Sichuan Province, the number of its sub-
_             projects is large and they have a scattered distribution. The objective of drawing up the environmental
management plan is to bring the environmental management of the whole project into the procedure
of the environmental management of construction projects in Sichuan Province during its
construction and operation so as to be supervised and managed. Thus, in the project area, the
environment will be well protected while the economy develops.
7.1.2 Contents
According to laws, regulations, environment quality standards, pollutant discharge standards
and the stipulation of "the three at the same time" concerning with the environmental management of
construction project both at the national level and the provincial level, the construction and operation
of a project must be supervised and managed. When the project is under implementation, the laws
and regulations of environmental protection and the environmental monitoring plan will be forced to
carry on at the same time, the contradiction between economic comstruction and environmental
protection will be coordinated at the same time so as to improve the coordinated development of
*             those two.
7 1.3 Institutions

vegetation coverage, etc. For example: Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Sichuan Research
Institution of Soil and Fertilizer, Science Research Institution of Forestry and so on.
A development organiztion of subproject should submit one copy of working" report of
environmental protection to its county project office every half a year. Either of the prefecture project
office or the county project office should submit one copy of workinlg report of environmrental
3             protection to the Provincial Project office and the Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau every
half a year. The Provincial Project office should submit one copy of working report of environmrental
protection to the World Bank, the National Project office and the Nationa. Environmnental Protection
Agency each year. Either of the Prefecture Environmental Protection Bureau or the County
Environmental Protection Bureau should submit one copy of working report of environment
supervision to the Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau every half a year. The Provincial
Environmental Protection Bureau should submit one copy of working report of envirorinent
supervision and monitoring to the -National Environmental Protection Agency and the World Bank.

For the environmental assessment of typical subprojects local people will be asked to fill in
*           the format of investigation. The practical methods can be found in the environmental assessment of
each subproject.
Through the public investigation, it is known that the majority of people support
implementation the action of the project, hope to construct it as quick as possible and hope the poor
*           people can get rid of poverty and become better off as soon as possible. Moreover, they put forward
some measures and suggestions for mitigating the negative impact caused by the project. They have
confidence to mitigate the negative impact of the project on the environment and meet the
requirements specified by the national or provincial standards. The public hope that the
*           implementation of project can promote the sustainable development of local economy.
9.0 Conclusion
(1). The key objective of the design of the whole project is to aid the poor farmers. The
*            project is mainly to provide basic living conditions for the people living in the poverty area, introduce
advanced technologies, exploit local resources, speed up the local people to get rid of poverty and
become better off. Because the majority of the subprojects are environrmental protection projects
themselves, belonging to category C projects, which need no environmental assessment. The minority
of the subprojects ( for example: the subproject of rural enterprise ) can promote local economy, but
they have some negative impact on local environment, belonging to category B projects of
environment assessment. After the analysis of preliminary assessment, the negative impact can be
mitigated through taking some counter measures, and "three wastes" discharge can meet the relevant
standards and requests of environmental protection of the country. So, seeing from the angle of
environmental protection, it is feasible that the objective,.trai of thought and basic contents of the
overall design of the project.
In order to protect the environment and achieve sustainable development of the project, it is
suggested that the environmental assessment of the project should be carried out through the its
*,           construction from  beginning to end, that means the whole process, from the beginning of
implementation of the project to its checking and acceptance of operation. This report is the
suggestion and conclusion of environmental assessment only in the feasibility stage. For the future
design and construction of the project, the on-going environmental monitoring and assessment will be
conducted in its implementation process so as to judge the previous suggestions and find new
environmental problems. In order to carry o-ut the environmental assessment of the project throughout
the construction of project from start to finish, it is better to entrust the environmental monitoring
and assessment in the implementation process of the construction project to Sichuan Research and
Monitoring Institute of Environmental Protection which has capability to the task of environmental
*            assessment of the project.

China QBPRP-Environmental Impact Statement
*                   (2). The project is constructed in the poor area. Because the level of productive management
as well as science and technology are low, in order to promote the stable development of the project
and get sustainable benefits from the project, it is necessary to increase the containment of science
and technology. So, during the implementation and operation of the project, it is requested to
conduct the plans of environmental management and environmental monitoring, and introduce
*            advanced technologies and scientific management methods so as to improve the sci-tec level and
levels of production, operation and management of the construction and operation of the project.
(3). Because cleaner production audit and environmental monitoring are important
components of environmental management and monitoring, each subproject, especially rural
enterprise subproject and land and farmer development component are requested to conduct the plans
of cleaner production audit and environmental monitonng, introduce advanced management methods
and reliable practical technologies so as to increase the utilization ratio of resources and energy,
eliminate the pollution in the process so as to reduce the final load of treatment, the investment and
*            the operation cost of pollution control.
(4). Standard-compliance discharge is the basic requirement for the constuction project,
which may cause pollution, raised by the environmental protection authorities. Durting the
engineering design of pollution control it should be adopted that practical technologies and facilities
0,           recommended by the National Environmental Protection Agency, and elaborate the design. It is
suggested that the development organization organizes environmental experts to investigate the
engineering scheme and preliminary plan of pollution control facilities, then submit the modified
documents of design to the Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau for approval. Thus ,the
reliability and operation rate of pollution control technologies and facilities can be increased.

Opinions and Suggestions on "The Outline of Environmental
Impact Assessment for the Sichuan_QPRP
The Supervision and Management Devision of the
*            National Environmental Protection Agency:
On the basis of Document HJJGWH (1996) NO.69 issued by NEPA, our center has
conducted technical assessment for "The Outline of Environmental Impact Assessment for the Sichuan
QBPRP", after discusion, put forward the following suggestions to your division.
*                   (1).  The guiding idealogy of the outline is clear, assessment catagery is proper, the
assessment factors are screened carefully, the topics are basically reasonable, the content of the
assessment is overall and lay stress on the key points. So, the outline can be submitted for approval
after replenishment and perfection.
(2). The following problems should be paid attention during the modification of the outline
and drawing up the environmental impact assessment statement(EIA):

China QBPRP--Environmental Impact Statement
(a) Because the project includes large contents and covers a wide, the ELA should be
*             conducted by adopting a combined method of macroscopic assessment and major project assessment
and analyse according to direct impacts and indirect impacts. Macroscopic assessment is to assess the
social, economic and environmental benefits from the area scope; for major project assessment, EIA
format and EIA statement can be drawm up separately on the basis of assessment catagery, the main
economic content is cleaner production, ecologic protection and effective measurement of
*             environmental protection.
(b). The discharge amount of main pollutants increased by the project is suggested to
calculate into the index of the total pollutant discharge control of Sichuan and coordinate by Sichuan
Environmental Protection Bureau.
(3). Some forecasting means should be in detail. It is suggested that detailed list method or
matrix method can be adopted in the assessment for the integrated agricultural development, education
and health and infrastructure.
(4).  For public participation, it is suggested that expert consultation and social
investigation should be combined.
(5). The project monitoring and environmental management should be put into effect as
careful as possible.
