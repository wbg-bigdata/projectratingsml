1.4 Alignmen2t of The Assesserent
*Alignment of the assessment includes ten counties, covering totally 13,943km2.
Environmental sensitive areas and the "types B" components will be focus.
- 1.5 Methods And Targets of The Assessmuent
*             t: .5.I Methods
"he enviror-mental audit is employed to examine influence of all the components on
eco-environment, especially rural industrial components. For some components which
belong to the assessment type "B", the special EIA reports will be completed              4
*             respectively. in which cleaning production in the design will be underlined instead of the
end pollutant control.
1.5.2 Targets
1'argets of the assessment is to coordinate interrelations between environmental
protection and poverty alleviation.
1.6 Contents of The EIA
Isecause the project consists ef 354 componerts 'which vary from component to
component. It difficult to evaluate it from one to one in detail. Here qualitative analysis
it applied to assess the sub-project. For some pollution components, EIA and cleaning
production design as a case study have be completed separately. The major contents
axe:
1) Survey on natural and social surroundings of the alignment;
(2) Assessment of the ambient environment;
13) Environmental audit of components of the agricultural sub-project, the focus will be
*            put at the "three techniques" of maize and livestock raising;
(4) Environmental audit of the rural industry sub-project, innluence of the mining and
processing components on the water environment will be underlined;
(5) Environrmental audit of the -nral infrastructure sub-project, influence of unbalance
between earth excavation and fill on soil erosion  will be emphasized;

2.1 @rigliTntaton
China's government has been paying a special attention to  reduction cf the pcor
population, which will be reduced to 80 million people according to the poverty standard  4
irn 1990's. But most of themn. distribute in the areas where the natural, social, ec¢nomic
and education-conditions are very poor. Which makes it troublesome.
From 1992, China's governmnent have been carrying out ((  eight seven" plan for
o   poverty alleviation )) in the future seven years. At the same time, a plan, i.e. i' lLve
seven' plan for poverty alleviation  , which wil1 make 5 million people get ride out of
poverty has been practicing by Shaarxi government.
The plan made by China's government has attracted highly attention from the WB. The
*VB is cooperating with China's government to carry out "southwest China poverty
-;!Ieviation project loaned by the WB " in Guang,xi, Yunan and Guizhuo provinces.
IWhich will wipe absolute poverty in the areas out.
The delegation was very interest in that China's government had put the project into
national 'eight seven' plan for poverty alleviation   When the WB inspection
delegation visited China second time in October 1995. While inspecting progress of the
project, the delegation also identified the plan for poverty alleviation in the Qinba
*             mrountainous area proposed by MTanagement Center of China's Foreign Investment
Project, and thought that the Qinba project area is an extension of the southwest project.
.'herefor, an agreement to continue cooperating with China's governmnent to alleviate
poverty in the Qinba mountai-nous area was reached. The both sides agreed that: the
*            NrWB preparation delegation would visit China in March 1996, and the assessment
delegation arrive in July and hold negotiation in October 1996.
2.2 Objectives
The basic objectives of the project are to increase the grain yield and solve the problem
of income sources for the poor farmers by utilizing the local natural resoutrces rationally;
a.nd better the present social, economic conditions and living standard of the household.
From 6th year of the project operation, the following objectives will be achieved.
*            (1) Grain production per capita reaches to 400kg in the project area;
(2) Net income per capita will be over 500 Yuan RMB;
(.3) The farmland or cash tree for each person reaches to 0.067ha or 0.133ha;

southern parts rurns thCorgh the area. Alverage hcight in the sautherrn part, i.e. Bashan
raountainours area. varies from 1,03Ori to 2.000m. Average height in the northern part,
*               i.e. Qinling Tncurntainous area, is between 1,500-3,00Qrn. Generally speaking, the height
above 600m is hill area, the 600-900r is low mountain area and the height above
1,0oOrn is mnedium or high monuntain area. Agricultural activities in the area are mainly
distributed between the height of 1,500-2,000m.

l'he project area generally belongs to north sub-tropical zone. But, the height above
1,000m, the climate types vary from temperate, sub-temperate and even to frigid
temperate. It depends mostly on the height. The annual mean temperature in hilly area      I
*               of the project is between 14 - 16 C, and the highest temperature is 41 C, the lowest is
-13 'C. The annual precipitation varies between 700-1,200mm. The non-frost period is
between 200-260 days. And the sunshine tine is 1,301-1,947 hours; In the mountainous
area, the annual mean temperature is 5-13.8 C. The lowest is -25 C. The non-frost period    4
*              is 149-242 days. The sunshine ti me is 1,301-1,947 ho-urs. And the annual precipitation

*              'There are 8 types of soil in the Qinba mountain area. Yellowish-brown and brown soiLs are
dominaant in Zhiashui, Zhenan and Ningshan counties, east part of the project area. Drab
soil and yellowish-brown soil are dominatedly distributed in the other 7 counties of the
project. Most soils are low fertility with little acid and alkaline. pH value is between 5.7  4
and 7.5. Organic matter content is 0.6-1.09%; nitrogen: 0.85-0.073%; potassium:
1.69-2.%,; phosphorous: 0.213-0.232%. Irrational nitrogen, phosphorous  and
potassium in the soils makes the middle and low production farmland reach to 73,000 ha.
Wv-hich restricted agricultural development in the area.
*             3. 1.  Hydrology
Water resources in the project area is plentiful. The drainage area of the most important
10 rivers are more than 1,000 km2. Of which, Hanjiang and Jialingjiang rivers are the
largest two rivers of them. Annual average value of runoff in the area is 11 billion cubic
*             meter. But the gap between the low and high flow year is tremendously large because
X -pply of the water depends primarily on precipitation. Monitoring results of the river
water reveals that the water quality is over grade 2 of the "National Surface Water Quality
Standard". Apart from rivers, reservoirs are another source. There are 30 reservoirs with
total storage capacity of 9,000,000 cubic meter, and 1,170 dams with the total storage

1Favorable influence; Rational a-splication of the fertilizer is in favor of increasing of
*                 lcrop yield.
Unfavorable influence: Overuse of chemrical fertilizer possibly contraminates ground and
surface water. Iicwever, aplicatica amount of chiemnical fertilizer in the project area
turing the oeneration period is much less than other develcped agricultural area in
rnhaanr c rovince. Where the contamiration: has not been found based on survey of

Intensive use of the pesticides wvill possibly contamrinates soils, water and edible part of
the crops because they con'tain many troxic substances such as organic nitrogen. and
phosphorus, arsenic, mercury, cadmium.
.
Mitigation Measures: A plan to use low residual toxicity pesticides have been made.
Besides, biological techhniques have been used by the local to control the crop pests and
diseases will be encouraged. Simultaneously, the pesticide contamination will be
maonitored every year (see page 62-63, monitoring).

poor management of the excrement and urine.
Mitigation Measures: Prior to deli-vry of the livestock, a examination of the grassland
resources must be done; The livestock scale should be regulated in Line with the burden
capacity of the grassland based on the monitoring results; Methane-generating pits are
very popular in the project area, WhI-nich wvill be ennployed by the project to treat the
E.xcremnent and urine from livestock raising.
4.1.2.3 Terrace BuildiSng
(1) Introduction to The Component
Totally 112,215,600 ynuan will be invested to build 14,174 ha stone terrace irn the 10
project counties. Which means that 0.016ha capital farmaland per capita will be added
and the total grain yield wvill increased by 212,61 1,000 kg.
*                 (2) Techniical Standard
.rcording to the comrponent design, the terrace will be in the shape of irregular oblong
and distributed along the contour line. Width of the terrace is about 2 meter and the
langth depends on the terrain. Plough sole of the terrace is more than 0.5m. There is a
ensbankment and drainage ditch aroGund the terrace to protect it from being burst by
flood. Height of the embankment is 1-3m with outside slope of 1:0.2. which tallies with
the local weather and agricultural production. All the terrace fields will be built in WVhere
the slope is less than 25 degree in order to mitigate the soil erosion. which accord with
the national policy that agricultural activities inl slope more than 25 degree are
*                 fsorbidden.
(3) Environmental influence

The earth used for terracing will be balanced by the rural infrastructure subproiect.
V7hich has been considered in the project design. Aftcr balance, the other needed earth
used for terracing will be taken nearby as possible as it can. The sites where the soil has
been removed will shortly be leveled and afforestrated.

1..2. 32 ACTudit c/Rural Industries
There arc big differences among the rural industrial components. It is necessary to
examine it from rone to one in detail. Table 4-3 gives an detail EI audIt of the industries.
By enviro-nmental influence auditing of the rural industries, it is clear that the rural
industries, in the terms Of environmental influence, can be classified into three types.
i.e., processing of agricultural and forest products, mrining and processing, processin-g of
*                the wild bio-resoureces.
'I) Processing industries of agricultural and forest products
Pollutants from this kind of industries are mainly SS, BOD and COD in the wastewater
aed solid organic wastes. which will reduce dissolved oxygen in the rivers. Consequently,
aquatic living things in the rivers will be affected. There is giant salamsander Lives ill
nost rivers of the Shaanxi project area. Water quality of the rivers should be stringently
controled.

I-fluences of miining and processorig in!duastr;ies cGL en..-' '----.e-t are rnainly in f-i7e
aspects: First, Plant destroy in the quarry and         colsapLe and lmanud-reac- flo--.
ca-used by change of original slope stability in old quarry;: Seco:nd, rolutirn of
s7astewater frorn the ore dressing process, which u7su5ally co1nten't high susPended solid,
somne content toxic and detrimental substances. For exarmple, man.ganese and chrom-liuom
in nanganese refining process. Additionally, the tailinggs reservoirs will potentially
affect the safety of the low-reach in flood season; Third, the waste residues fromri the
mrininrg mray jam the rivers for unproperly discard; Fourth, dust and smoky from the
nowder processing and the boiler coal combustion.; fifth, noise from ueoplosion and the
pullve:rizes.
*                (3) Processing industries of wild bio-resources
The wild bio-resources may be overused and even exhausted for the profit incentive.
4.2.4 lUeasuxres
e                Cleaning production is a worldwide tendency in pollution control. It is different from entd
pollutant treatment in that which can m inimize pollutants in the design. Therefor, all
. ie industrial components must design and constructed accord.ineg to the cleaning
production principle. Besides, the following ,measures sho-ald be taken into consider.
{(1) Agricultural processing com-ponents
The processing of fruits, meats, Chinese noodle, starch and the reeihng which great
amount of TSS, BOD, COD are contented in the efiluent must comnplete EIA. And some
bio-treatment facilities for wastewater must be built based on the assessment resul'ts.
For solid organic wastes, which can be used for feed, should be comprehensively
cdesigned with livestock raising components.
(2) Mining and processing com-ponents
EllA must be completed for all ruining and processing components. The proposed
location, technological processes, ecological destroy in the quarries, "three wastes"
treatment facilities, noise control, design of the tailing dams should be proved to be
acceptable.
*                (3) Processing industries of the wild bio-resourees
The washing wvastewater must be settled and recycled and the final effluent must be
under the effluent standard. The production scale must be controlled to some extent. At
the same time, a plail to cultivate and protect the wild bio-resouces should be made.

2.1 Locat tion An d Layso . Za't
2.1.1 Location-
Location of the plant in middle reach of VWuyiu valey is better than location in outlet of
the valley because there are less residents living the-re. However, there a elevated plant
base and a flood presex-vation ermb.an-m1unent to keepirg the plant from being destroyed by
tLhe biggest flood in a century are necessary
*                  2. 1.2 Lr,2,amt.-L
The uroduction area and living, area should be distributed in the direction of north-west
directi;on because the valley runs the direction of east-west direction. In that way, the
przoduct quality and the Lving environment will be little affected.
2.2 D'isposal of the slag
The stone in Zhenan cou-nty is m-iore than earth and rnost building materials are bricks.
B-at earth used for brick making is net encugh. The particle of slag fromn the plant is very
&._mall- Wvhich carn be used for brick maraiing. Therefor, we recommerd that four brick
r ack ing machines are boTght and all the slag is used for brick making. In the case Q0,000
bric:ks can be produced by the plant daily and the annual profit is 300,000 yuan RMB.
Certainly the slag is no more a pollution source.
*                  2.3 Chimney
The chimney should 'e heighten to 55mrr. WThich will enpand the difflusion area and
mitigate emission concentration.

acere are two schemnes f£or the loscation Hof thAe p5tslant. Onxe is located inl the Xiaedul village
and another is in Cheneia village. The betl, have convenient traffic and post conditions.
owaever, Thle former is frunner toc the county town than Lthe later and ta: water is not
reachable. For tne later, electricity and tap water are reachable. There is a cannory plant
close to it. Vhich can not run around year because the raw material is out of season in
the wvinter. Its equipmnent can be used bv the new nplarnt. And the new bu ilt cold-storage
can be used bW the old one. Therefrb, it is bettor to locate the plant in Chenjia village.
*                 2.1.2 L-sy<out
There is no designL for layout of tLe plant. Here it is e nvr-ronmentally recomm.,ended that
all worshilps and the boiler house stand collectively niear ILujia river side. The produ-ct
storehouse, office and living areas stand at thie west side of the pdelnt, Which can mnitigate
influence of the pnollutants on the residents Eving in the west slope to the planj2t.
