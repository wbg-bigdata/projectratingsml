Chapter 1 Introduction
1.1 Significance of the Poverty Reduction Project
The Daba Mountain Area of Qin Mountain (Qinba Mountain Area) is one of the rural areas where
0                   having large amount of poverty people in China. Disadvantages of this area include over 10
million of poverty population, many high and steep hills, more sloping lands and less arable lands,
heavy erosion of surface and loss of soil with 700-1600 mm annual precipitation, and low
agricultural output. Xihaigu Area in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is a region where mainly
populated with Hui people and locates in the West of Yellow Plateau. There are frequent natural
X                   disasters there and nine years of drought out of ten. In both areas, residents earn less than 320
RMB yuan per year with little infrastructure and poor education. The poverty peasants could not
stop the vicious cycle of "low income-light development-heavy damage to resources" in the
production pattern. There is no positive push or influence on the areas no matter how rapid the
national economy develops. This is because: Firstly, the peasants have no surplus traditional farm
*                   products (grain and livestock products) for low output and worse relationship between human
being and land. When their price rise with development of the national economy, they have to pay
more money to buy necessary products instead of selling them. Secondly, when new farm products
demanded the peasants have no money to develop them and thus to increase their income. And
0                  finally, the local second and third industries development are so slow that the peasants have few
opportunities of employment, while such opportunities in other places cannot be shared by them
for lacking information and fearing risk.
Facing to the absolute poverty population with shortage of natural resources, Chinese government
*                  has formulated the Eighth Seven-Year National Plan of Poverty Reduction aiming at making the
poverty population get warm and well fed. During the seven years from 1994 to 2000, labors,
funds, and materials from both the governments and society will be centralized to implement in
poverty areas projects of land integrative development and utilization orientated by ecological
principles and the market economy to improve agricultural production efficiency. Town industries
will be developed and rural infrastructure will be improved. At the same time, surplus labor will
be organized for labor mobility. By these measures the self-closed pattern of poverty areas should
be broken and they could join in the development cycle of the national economy step by step.
*                 According to our actual demands and based on successful implementation of the Southwest China
Poverty Reduction Project loaned by the World Bank, the Leading Group of Poverty Reduction
under the State Council applied for listing the Qinba Mountain Area Poverty Reduction Project in
the loaning plan from the World Bank (National Development Document [1995] No.15) in March
1995. After consultations of the State Planning Committee and the Ministry of Financial with the
*                 World Bank, the project was approved to list in the Three Years Loan Plan of Chinese
Government from the World Bank.

Among 6 categories of projects EIA emphasis, there are two categories that are the land and
farmer development and rural enterprises development should pay special attention.
For land and farmer development, EIA emphasis is on agricultural ecological environment,
fertilizer and chemical, plastic film, capacity of water resource.
For rural enterprises development, EIA emphasis is on cleaner production (CP) technologies and
*                   end-treatment of town enterprises, and on the explore of local resource potentials and economic
benefit of the projects. Typical examples are chosen from sub-projects. Please refer to Chapter 5
for detail information on stress EIA standards relating directly to CP technologies and end-
treatment standards.

2.1 Overall Planning of the Loan Project
2.1.1 Strategy of the Qinba Poverty Reduction Project
*
Considering the causes and characteristics of poverty in the Qinba Mountains Area, the project do
not adopt single project to reduce poverty. Instead, it focuses on strengthening investment and
development. The land output and peasant income will be increased through land and farmer
development, land infrastructure, water and soil reservation, crop and farning renewal, and
*                   livestock breeding. Drinking water, transportation, and electric power will be enhanced by adding
infrastructure. Labor quality will be improved through fundamental education and training.
Structures of local industries and employment will be adjusted by developing town enterprises and
country fairs. Labor mobility will be encouraged to improve their abilities of management and
adaptation. By all above measures the living and production environments of poverty population
and the peasant quality should be improved in the project areas. By administration and
development in a comprehensive way, the optimum combination and output of within the project
system can be realized with full considerations of the link and integrity among projects relating to
economic benefit, infrastructure, and social service. All of these aim at helping the poverty

planting. In order to solve the herbage problem of breeding, each home must plant one half mu
herbage per capita besides protection and use the natural grazing land. Selecting the fine herbage
such as violet flower lucerne to plant.
E. Land Transform
*                    Land transform should base on the overall plan of land usage, according to the principle of
complicated arrange of mountains, water, fields, forests and roads, carrying on overall
arrangement, reinforce rationally to improve the use value of the farm land.
a. Paddy Field Transform
Transformning water paddy field, low paddy field and land transformed field to achieve the aim of
discharging three water ( soil water, ground water or rock layer water, surface water ), kill the four
hazards (cold, rotten, toxin, bunch ) , can discharge and irrigate, can water and dry, turn one
mature to two or three matures, the irrigation ditches typically 80-100cm, the inner three ditches
40-50 cm, the blocks of field is smooth square, showing water without mud. The channel system
in plain dam area are typically arranged with irrigation channels, creeks and rivers, line channels
and irrigation channels are paralleled, with a shape of Chinese letter, the main escape canal should
be in the low area, the ditch and valley fields in hills area and escape and irrigating canal are
*                    arranged according to the mountain, and ditch and valley, big round according around, small
round adopted straight or straight in parts, the main escape canal should be arranged at the side
which has a large area of accumulating water. The canals should along the mountains taking up
little or no fine field and lands to reduce the engineering and material.
Concentrated transform are of several thousand mu, using the original plow road and walk road to
stabilize and widen, depending on the principle of short distant and small area to plan the roads,
the improved area which is relatively smooth and no big vertical gradient must be rearranged the
field shape, the slot must be paralleled as possible, the most suitable size of the slots is typically
0.2 ha.
b. Drought Land Transform
Slope surface soil has the problems of sharp, surface, drought, thin and erosion, etc. So it must be
*                   transformed. Turning the three losing soil of water losing, soil losing, fertilizer losing to three
keeping soil of keeping water, soil and fertilizer, controlling the erosion of soil, thicken the soil
layer, reform the method of cultivating, improving the multiple seed indicators and yield per unit
area, turn two mature to three, four mature one year. The standard are: land smooth, the slope
degree reduced to less than 5 degree, soil layer 60-70cm thick. Mature soil layer is 20cm, no
particles and sands, the quality of soil are generally sandy loam to clay, the ridges is stable, the
low banks is not very high, usually about I00cm, keeping two horse band, the width of the top of
the band is 20-30cm, the outer slope of the low bank planting grass or bush to protect itself.
Having complete water system in the surface of the slope and complete ancillary equipment, three
*                   ditch(escape canal, back canal and along mountain canal) and three ponds (water store pond, sand

sink pond , manure pond),forest, road(plowing row) complete, fertilized soil keeping surface soil,
apply organic fertilizer and chemical fertilizer to improve the structure, fertilize the soil. Generally,
the production of crops can be increased more than 2,250 kg per ha by transforming the slope
surface soil, the income can be increased over 4,500 yuan. If using in developing economic forests,
and economic crops, the income can be doubled. The technical standards, technical methods of
slope field transform are the same as non-field on the whole. The non-cultivate develop has a
*                   higher benefit.
For the slope land has a slope degree between 7-15, can be transformed into terraced field. The
soil cubic equilibrium must be calculated in engineering. The lower layer must be stabilized after
clean the base and then build ridges, ridges and low banks are required to equal slope, the top of
*                   low banks is horizontal and stable. Applying fertilizer to improve soil, using organic and inorganic
fertilizer. Reclaim the soil, plowing more than 0.3m. Using the plow in time, and carry on
preserving the moisture of the autumn soil. Outside the low banks and ridges, the economic bush,
such as yellow flower, Ningtiao, mountain peach and mountain apricots can be planted to protect
the field low banks and ridges.
5. Investment in 171 projects of rural enterprises are summarized in Table 2-2.
6. There are 37 projects on institution building and poverty monitoring facilities. These projects
*:                  take "hardware construction" as the basis and "software construction" as the center. The
"hardware" includes offices, transportation tools, and monitoring facilities for the three provinces
project offices. The "software" is to form a effective administrative system by enforcing function
and clarifying duty, to train project administrators and establish service and support system. By
organically combination of the hardware and software, a nearly perfect operation system can be
formed and thus all functions can be transferred and realized smoothly and rapidly.

2.2 Feasibility of the Project Implementation
2.2.1 Basic conditions of the projects are ready in the areas and it is possible to implement the
projects.
I.  The State policy on rural economic development and on poverty reduction are stable for a
*                       long time, which gives the project a strong support.
2.  The project areas locate in the special poverty region of China and have become priorities in
poverty reduction policy on province level, which means the Project can get supports from
the local governments.
3.  Rich experiences of the local people and leaders have been accumulated during long-term
poverty reduction practices. In addition, The implementation of the Southwest China Poverty
Reduction Project Loaned by the World Bank can serve as a useful example for the Qinba
Mountains Poverty Reduction Project.
4.  Much potential exists in the efficiency and degree of resources utilization. The products of
the projects are necessary goods for life and production, so they have good economic and
social benefits.
2.2.2 The implementation of the Project is reasonable. The reasons include two following aspects:
*                   I.  The developing strategy is used in the poverty reduction. With the advanced system of
project management introduced by the World Bank, the Project can be carried out in a
standard and scientific routine way. Therefore, it can be a demonstration project with
significance on exploring poverty reduction path, resolving problems in poverty reduction,
and quickening its reformation.
2.  The project construction plays a critical role in economic development because it is
advantageous to making the peasants warm and well-fed, increasing overall strength and
economic development in the project areas, and alleviating the funds shortage.
*                  To summarize, the overall planning frame and technical strategy of the project is reasonable and
its contents are appropriate. So it is exactly a poverty reduction project.

Chapter 3  Environmental Situation of the Project Area
3.1 Geography
The Project area is located in southwest and northwest parts of China, with latitude of
*                 30°18'N-37°13'N and longitude of 105°17'E-109036'E. It includes two geographical regions:
the Qinba Mountains Area and the Loess Plateau Area.
The Sichuan projects cover the Qinba Mountains Area with latitude of 3001 S'N-3 1031.3'N and
longitude of 105°35.6'E-108°32'E. The area includes mountains and hills. 5 counties, Chaotian,
Wangeang, Nanjiang, Tongjiang, and Xuanhan, are in mountain area while 7 counties, Cangxi,
Yilong, Langzhong, Nanbu, Jianling, Quxian, and Guangan, are in hilly area.
Shannxi projects cover ten counties in south of the Qin Mountain and north of the Daba Mountain
v                 with latitude of 32007'N-33055'N and longitude of 105°29'E-109°36'E. 8 counties, Xixiang,
Zhcnba, Ziyang, Hanyin, Ankang, Ningshann, Zhenan, and Zuoshui, are in the upper reaches of
Hanjiang River. Most of the Lueyang (71%) and Ningqiang (69%) are in the upper reaches of the
Jianlingjiang River.
*                 Ningxia projects cover 4 counties, Xiji, Haiyuan, Tongxin, and Jingyuan, with latitude of
35°14'N- 37'13'N  and longitude of 105°17'E-106°39'E. In this region, Lupan Mountain
(2,93 1m) stretches from the south to the north joining with Yueliang Mountain (2,632m), Nanhua
Mountain (2,954m) and Xihua Mountain (2,703m).
3.2 Environment
The project area includes large mountains, deep village, and steep slopes; small arable land with
thin soil layer, old pieces, little fertility (little nitrogen and phosphorus), much potassium, and poor
*                 ability to conserve water and soil. However, there are many uncultivated lands with potential of
full utilization.
The climates are of diversity in the area with uneven distribution of participation, which is hardly
utilized in agricultural activities. It is hard for people and livestock to find water during drought
0                 seasons because of few water conservancy facilities available. The major calamity includes
drought, waterlogging, hail, windstorm, and frost, which can bring great damage to agricultural
production.
*                 In project area there are varieties of animals and plants and highly exploitable mineral resources.
However, the agricultural ecosystem in the project area has been seriously damaged by forest
combustion, wastelands cultivation, and overgrazing. Average income per capita in this area is
less than 320 RMB yuan, which is lower than the margin line of 434 RMB yuan set by the State in
1994. It results from narrow production way, simple economic structure, low productivity, less
*                 social service, and backward technology.

Thereafter, it is necessary to apply the World Bank loans for exploring and utilizing resources,
establishing and maintaining ecological agriculture in the mountain area, and developing
commodity economy in the poverty zone.
3.3 Conditions of Environmental Quality
Most of the project area possesses good environmental quality with capacity of receiving
pollutants from the projects. Only a few regions with high density population have local industrial
pollution.

Chapter 4  Environmental Impact Prediction and Assessment
This chapter will analysis the impact of several kinds of sub-project in the China Qinba Mountains
Poverty Reduction Project on the social economy, ecosystem and natural environment of the
project region. This chapter will give the quantitative or qualitative prediction and assessment to
*                   some ecosystem targets, such as the situation of soil erosion, the rate of plant cover, the impact on
soil of the applying of fertilizer, insecticide and plastic films, the ability of fighting natural
calamities of agricultural region. The prediction and assessment of the impact of the rural
enterprises development projects of township enterprises on environment will be explained detail
in the next chapter.
4.1 Environmental Impact Assessment of the Project of Exploiting Lands and Developing
Agriculture
This kind of project has an important impact on social economy ecosystem  and natural
environment. It represents thal the character of the China Qinba Mountains Poverty Reduction
Project is attaching a great importance to ecological agriculture. It is one of the major kinds of this
Environmental Impact Assessment.
*                   4.1.1 Analysis of Major Impact
4.1. 1.1 Impact on Natural Ecosystem
1. Planting trees to conserve water and prevent soil erosion, planting fruit trees on barren hills,
planting forage grasses and building terraced fields on the slopes will improve the situation of soil
erosion, increase the rate of plant cover, adjust the temperature and humidity of the air, purify the
air and protect wild animals.
*                   2. The impact on product forces of soil is produced comprehensively by a lot of technical methods,
such as returning straws to the fields, planting green manure crops, spreading barnyard manure,
applying fertilizer, increasing the rate of forest cover and cultivating barren lands. The direct
effects are the increase of crop yields and the conservation and balance of soil fertility. Applying
excessive fertilizer or only one kind of fertilizer will cause the imbalance of nutrition and the
*                   reduction of crop yields.
3. Applying of insecticide has little impact on atmosphere, water, soil and living creatures. The
main harm and hazard is the acute poisoning caused by neglecting operating rules and regulations
when spraying insecticide or the acute poisoning caused by eating fruits and food polluted by
insecticide or drinking polluted water. Insecticide has big effect to prevent plant diseases and
insect pests and increase the crop yields.
4. The structure of the using of agricultural fields, such as the partition of constitution of
*                   cultivated lands, orchards, forests and grasslands, is becoming more reasonable. The area under
27



.
EIS FOR THE CHINA QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT                  CRAES 1996
irrigation is increasing. All these are profitable to the virtuous cycle of the ecosystem in this
region.
5. Applying of plastic films shortens the mature period of crops and increases the utilization ratio
of water. The plastic films can preserve soil fertility, help decompose the organic substances in
soil and increase the content of quick-acting nutrients. It can also improve the physicochemical
*                   properties of soil and reduce the hardness and unit weight of soil. It can inhibit the growth of
weeds in the fields. When applying plastic films for a long period of time, the remnant will impact
the growth of crop roots, then reduce the crop yields. At the same time, plastic films can impact
the sink of rainwater, then it will cause soil erosion.
6. The development of livestock farming supplies a lot of organic manure to farming. Straw will
be forage grasses. It will reduce the waste of resources. If we cannot adjust the balance of
grasslands and livestock and over graze, we will destroy the vegetation. On the other hand,
because fuel, feed and manure are inadequate in this region. If we expand the scope of agriculture,
e                   the contradiction will aggravate. Then it will cause to improperly plant, dig and graze, then will
accelerate the destroy of vegetation and soil erosion. If the folds and excrement and urine of
livestock can't be disposed properly, it will cause some hygiene problems and environmental
pollution.
*                   7. Burning reclaim wasteland causes the waste of resources and air pollution. Terracing the scopes
and taking soil from other lands destroyed the vegetation of these lands. At the same time, the
structure of artificial topsoil becomes very loose, the fertility gets lower and it can cause soil
erosion easily.
4.1.1.2 Impact on Social Environment
1. Per capita area of cultivated farmland, economic forest, livestock and income increase
*                   2. With the increasing of the area of cultivated lands and forests, the multiple crop index increases.
Some spare labors can obtain employment.
3. The spreading and training of advanced technology can increase the level of production
technology of farmers in this region, enhance the quality of the people. Then it brings about the
0                   reasonable use of natural resources, the increasing of the ability to resist drought and flood of
agriculture. Then the economy and natural ecosystem of this region can be developed sustained.
4. With the developing of agriculture, the number of barren hills is decreasing. The landscapes
will become more beautiful
5. The transform of low and medium yield lands can increase the productivity per unit area. Then
the economic returns in this region can increase.
*                   6. With the increasing of per capita income, the educational hygiene undertakings will be
28



EIS FOR THE CHINA QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT                         CRAES 1996
improved. It can benefit the stability of society.
4.1.2 Environmental Impact Assessment of Soil Erosion
4.1.2.1 Cause of Soil Erosion
*                     The soil erosion in Qinba Mountains Area has natural and anthropogenic causes.
The proportion of the area of mountains to the total area of lands in this region is very high.
Topography rises and falls sharply. There are cracks everywhere. The lands break up. Ridges
crisscross. There are ditches and gullies everywhere. Raining in a large scale in a short time can
cause the erosion of the earth surface and soil erosion. There are very few cultivated lands, so the
0                      crop yield in this region is very low. Exploiting the hills, destroying the forests and cutting down
too many trees can make some hills and dunes barren and destroy the balance of ecosystem and
the soil erosion will be aggravated.
The harm of soil erosion is to reduce the soil fertility. The fertile topsoil ( layer A) is washed away
completely, subsoil ( layer B) or base-soil ( layer C) are corroded. The temperature of the surface
earth is very high, so trees and grasses survive with difficulty. Soil erosion can enhance the
riverbed but will make some negative influence the shipping. Rivers will be silted. The frequent
flood will endanger the life and property of people. At the same time, the life of reservoir could be
shortened. That will cost us a lot.
4.1.2.2 Impact Prediction and Assessment of Soil Erosion in Operating Period
The development of ecological agriculture will greatly reduce the area of soil erosion in this
region. For example, the area of soil erosion in county Liangzhong will decrease from 2,355.7
ha.(before developing) to 636.04 ha.(after developing). The area of soil erosion in Quxian will
decrease from 16,116 ha.(before developing) to 2,950 ha.(after developing). See Table 4-1 for
detail.

FIS FOR THE CHINA QINBA MOUNTAINS POVEIRTY REDUCTION PROJECT                   CRAES 1996
The Bureau of Soil and Water Conservation in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region supplies the
criteria that planting one ha. trees can reduce 60 ton of eroded soil each year, reclaiming one ha.
barren slopes can reduce about 50 ton of eroded soil each year. We can predict that forestry and
reclaiming can reduce about 450xl04 ton eroded soil each year.
4.1.2.3 Assessment of Soil Erosion in the Operating Period
The operating period is the essential period of inhibiting soil erosion. The program will adopt
three kinds of reclaiming method.
*                    1. Terraced fields of equal height
Loosen the topsoil and form the cultivated layer. This kind of method is applied to barren slopes
where the rate of vegetation cover is less than 5%. Because of soil erosion, the weathered topsoil
will wash away with water, bed rocks are exposing. People make artificial layer for ventilating and
*                    storing water, then build terraced fields of equal height, plant trees and grasses to protect the
slopes.
2. Grass fence
Field plant long-life fruit trees. In the operating period, people get rid of nonobjective plants and
plant green manure crops. This method gives no chance for the topsoil to expose. It has best effect
to prevent soil erosion in the operating period.
3. Reclamation along the slopes
This method is applied to gentle scopes. It can develop artificial planting system without
destroying pro-vegetation. Because there is no embankment and grass fences may be effect the
slopes, we can not control the soil erosion.
Planting a large area of forests in the hill top can not destroy topsoil and original vegetation. We
*                    replant forest and form mixed forest, field plant objective trees and trees suitable to the local
conditions in slopes that has a single kind of trees. Table 4-2 shows the testing result of the other
World Bank loan project of 1992.

4.1.2.4 Prevention and Treatment of Soil Erosion
The factors causing soil erosion involve terraced field by changing slopes, rural roads and water
loss conservancy facilities, irrigation and overgrazing are involved .
The mitigation measures and alternative programs include:
l.Cultivation following the slow slope, not destroying the wild vegetables, the construction stage
should be chosen out of the raining season. Grow some kinds of grass at first, and then plant more
aged fruit trees. Clear the unexpected plants by yeas in the construction stage, plant the green
manure at the mean time . Fore the slope lands, should be back the cultivation to the forest.
.
2.The construction of water reservation facilities (irrigation canals and ditches, mountain
embankment etc.) should be proceeded in the dry season. Planting shelter forest at the moment.
3.When the orchards get dense, the distance between tree should be widen, plant the green manure
or leguminous plant. When the large scale forest has been set up, replanting as soon as possible.
Cutting should be done in dry season and it should be a plot cutting (best to refer Chinese
checkers style, and keep the distance between trees ).
3                   4.Grazing strictly according to the capacity of the grazing land, and the grazing land should be
rotated periodically.
5.Design quantity of firewood forest, develop rural biogas project, spread economical stove. In
some better conditional region having some advantage. Other every source such as coal and
electric can be used popularly.
6. Adopt the measures of irrigation saving water. In some well conditional areas, spring irrigation
system can be designed, assuring the rate of seeping higher than that of spraying.
.
7. On the seriously lost and eroded by water waster slope lands and mountain lands. Take the
measures both of engineering and biology to prevent from ditch eroding, slope sliding and hill
collapsing.
*                  8. Do the best to avoid the cultivation following the slope, adopt the technology processes which
soil and water loss is small, in the mountain land full of rocks, accelerating the constructions of
reservation soil by building wall.

4.1.3.2 Environmental Impact Analysis After Changing the Condition of Landing Utilization
1.   Impact on local climate
The structure change of land using will cause some influence on local climate, such as a
simulate area bring barren hills under cultivation and planting wetland pine and masson pine,
planting fruit trees surround the farmers houses will cause the temperature decreasing. It is
*                             clear that the local climate was getting much better and the ability of defending windstorm
will strengthen.
2.  Soil erosion can be controlled.
*                            The contour wasteland reclaiming method will be used in the project area. Planting straw
hedge and water and soil conservation forest and forming grade vegetation structure of high forest,
bush and grass. The surface runoff resisting ability will be increased in a large scale. As the result,
the soil erosion will be avoided effectively.
3. The ability of adjusting and storing water will strengthen.
The area of barren lands in this region will decrease a lot. The area of forests will increase
sharply. The area of recently planted vegetation is 206,300 ha. If one ha forest can conserve 400
tons of water. then it can conserve 82,520,000  tons of water. This is of great use to the natural
adjusting and storing of water resources in this region. In one hand, vegetation can alleviate the
erosion of topsoil caused by storms. In the other hand, root system can fix soil, improve the
structure and increase the content of water in soil, then increase the ability of conserving water.
We also design some small ponds and small reservoirs to conserve water.

4. Ecosystem gets more stable.
After developing, farming, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery have developed. Now, there are
few barren hills and lands remaining. Agriculture will develop fully. The ecosystems become
more stable.
5.Locat economy will be more prosperous.
*                    The crops in this region are mainly grains before developing. After developing, we plant
economic fruit trees, develop livestock raising. Every year we can supply a lot of agriculture side
line products to the society and play an important role in developing local economy.
*                    4.1.4 Prediction ahd Environmental Impact Assessment of Soil Fertility
4.1.4.1 Analysis of the Current Condition of Soil Fertility
*                    There are eight types of soil in Qinba Mountains Areas. Most of them are yellowish-brown soil
and brown soil developed from sandstone, Mudstone and limestone, violet soil developed from
violet stone. The quality of the soil is very poor. The soil is sticky and not suitable for cultivating.
The Soil is of low fertility. The content of organic substance is very low. The soil in this region is
generally lack of N and P. Though it contains enough K, the proportion is not reasonable. See
Table
4-5.
4.1.4.2 Prediction of Soil Fertility
0
Soil fertility is a comprehensive concept which shows that the property, statement of soil. In the
other word, it is the ability which converts and adjusts the physiological materials by soil. And the
level of the physiological materials which offered by soil in a certain time. Thus soil fertility is not
*                   only the function of soil property, but also the function of time.
The prediction of soil fertility in this report is the increasing and decreasing of the soil fertility
amount which were based on the hypothesis which the basic properties of soil fertility were steady
relatively depends on the input and output balance of energy and materials, and the adjustment of
*                   soil water and heat conditions.
I . Prediction of soil organic content
The organic mass content of soil will influence the soil structure and other physical and
chemical properties. It is soil conversion, adjustment ability of water, fertility, gases and heat
*                        which are soil needed. In the supplying of soil fertility, it is reported that 30-40% of N,60-
70% of P and 90% of K are offered by organic content. Thus, the organic fertility applying is
not only important to in the soil nutrient balance, but also important to soil transformation,
especially in the situation of unbalance of N,P and K in China.

The sources of organic mass are the amount of organic roots of crop. It is about 20-25% of
the plant'organic body. In order to keep the balance of organic mass of soil, it is necessary to
use different ways which are urinate applying, green manure planting, livestock fertility and
compost made of stalks applying. Those are the most important way to avoid the soil fertility
failing.

fertilizers used in the project region of Shaanxi province.
*                     2. The soil fertility prediction is much complicated to soil organic mass prediction. The research
reports point out that one third of fertilizer of absorbed fertilizer. is coming from soil, the soil
contributing rate is about 66.1-77.5%. The increasing values of fertility of soil after using N,P and
K can be represented by the amount of fertilizer. See Table 4-6 and Table 4-7.

4.1.4.3 Impact Analysis of Soil Structure
*                   In order to improve thc soil condition, we apply some organic manure, such as green manure. In
this way, the soil structure will change and some bad characters, such as sticky, hard and barren,
are improved. When we apply a lot of organic manure, the soil becomes more porous and can
ventilate and soak water better. The granular structure is forming gradually.
The condition of the content of N is similar to that of organic substances. In this program, the
supply of N fertilizer is abundant, so the soil will not be insufficient of N. This can be helpful to
increase the accumulation of organic substances. The content of P in Qinba Mountains Areas is
very low. If we neglect to apply more P, the cultivating of soil and soil structure will be affected.
4.1.4.4 Impact Analysis of the Sustenance of Agriculture
1. Impact on soil acidity and exchange capacity
*                   Applying green manure can have impact on hydrolysis acidity of soil, cation exchange capacity
and saturation of salt. After applying green manure, pH and cation exchange capacity in soil will
change a lot. Soil will change from acid to neutral. Cation exchange capacity and saturation of salt
are increasing gradually.
*                   2. Impact on soil unit weight and porosity
Organic substances will accumulate in the soil after applying green manure, then the soil unit
weight and porosity will change. Generally, soil unit weight will decrease and porosity will
increase.

3. Impact on content of N, P, K in soil
In this program, we apply a large amount of N, P, K fertilizer. It will increase the content of N, P,
K in soil and raise the soil fertility. Then the crop yield will increase accordingly.

4.1.4.5 Potential Negative Impact Analysis
The impact of spreading fertilizer on the environment is mainly caused by spreading
improperly ,especially spreading more N and P fertilizer than the requirement of the normal
growth of plants. All these make N, P fertilizer in the soil lose into water-body and other
*                   environment and cause many environmental problems.
]. Potential environmental problems of the project design
Qingba program mainly develop the fertilizer plan of plants, but it only develop the balance of
*                   spreading fertilizer. Because different organic fertilizers have different content of N and P, the
balance of fertilizer amount cannot represent the balance nutrient. For example, the pond mud and
excrement and urine of pigs, though they have the same amount, the content of N, P fertilizers and
the effect of fertilizers is different from each other greatly. So the organic fertilizer amount
balance only cannot explain the need and supply between plants and fertilizers, they cannot reflect
the true fertilizer amount. So it is not reasonable to instruct the fertilizer spreading according to
this balance. It will lead to the scarcity of N and P fertilizer in the soil and consequently decrease
the yield and quality of agriculture product, or there are more N and P fertilizers in the soil which
can easily lose into environment and cause eutrophication in lakes and rivers. At the same time, N
*                   fertilizer in the soil can transfer into a large amount NO3- in the good condition that can cause the
pollution of vegetable and feeding plants and ground water . The great amount of N03- will do
harm to human and livestock.
Therefore about the fertilizer amount, whether in a new rice field which comes from barren field
or in a low-yield field once planting rice or in other fields once growing other plants, the period of
construction and running should be suitable for the fertilizer of soil especially plan the spreading
amount according to the change of nutrient. But we can't always keep the same amount. Ordinarily
it is very reasonable that the amount of spreading fertilizers is very small in the early period and
the spreading amount is very large in the final period. If we spread fertilizers many times aimlessly,
it can cause the lost of fertilizers and pollute the environment.
2. Potential environment problems of construction period
*                   Ordinarily in the period item construction, we need to build the production base of economic trees
such as fruit trees in the barren fields, but the nutrient of soil is extremely scare in some item areas
especially non-forest areas in which water and soil lose greatly. The barren areas are mostly hills
and mountain areas. Though new production base is constructed as horizontal terraced fields, the
organic materials are very scare .In the early period there are no root-twisting and the structure of
soil is very bad and the root can't glue soil easily and ability of anti-erode is very weak, so the lose
of water and soil is very serious in the early period of reclaiming and culturing wasteland which
has very few surface plants. Nutrient is difficult to accumulate, so a large amount of fertilizers
should be spread to gather the fertilizers in the soils in the early periods. Even in some low-
*                  production field which located in low an horizontal areas, a large amount fertilizers should be

spread. We must plan the amount carefully and keep balance between spreading amount and
requiring amount.
4.1.4.6 Prevention of Fertilizer Pollution
Abusing fertilizer would result in soil harden, surface water and ground water pollution, the
*                     prevention measure has follow:
1. Develop breeding , apply much more organic green manure, reduce the chemical fertilizer
using.
2. Apply fertilizer relational, reduce the loss of chemical fertilizer.
3. Set up the water quality monitoring point on the enclosed water body, such as the entrance of a
*                     lake. Control the total amount of N and P.
4. Monitor the quality of drinking source periodically.
4.1.5 Environmental Impact Assessment of Pesticide Applying
To keep on guard the plants and fruit trees high and steady production and preventing
insect ,weeds and bad effect of other living things ,we must spread some farm chemical including
insecticide, miticide, herbicide, pesticide, raticide, fungusicide, microbicide, etc. Table 4-1 1 shows
the Amount of pesticide use in Tongjiang county in Sichuan province. Different kind of pesticides
*                     will be used for different crops and the using amount will be quite different.

X                    4.1.5.1 Environmental Impact Analysis of Pesticide Applying
The pesticide spreading in the item areas has some toxic effect, when the spreading amount
surpasses the ability that environment can clean itself in this areas, it will cause some pesticide
pollution to many degrees, generally will cause surface pollution in a large areas.
I. Pollution of pesticide to the atmosphere
During the process of spreading pesticide, some tiny pesticide drops and granary will float in the
e                    air. At the same time in the sunny weather, water-soluble pesticide may evaporate as water vapor.
The vapor of pesticide farm spreads everywhere in the spreading places that make men and
livestock in danger directly. In the windy condition, human health and livestock in the downwind
area will be impaired.
*                    2. Pollution of pesticide to the waterbody
There are two ways that pesticide farm gets into waterbody, one is to get into waterbody directly,
another is to get into waterbody by precipitation. When pesticide gets into open waterbody(live
*                   water)such as river, irrigation canal after diluting, spreading and bio-decompose, the concentration
of pesticide will go down quickly. No serious problems will take place when the amount of farm
chemical is not very large and the toxicity is very low. When insecticide gets into close
waterbody(dead water)such as lake, hill pond, after evaporating, spreading and biocompose, the
concentration will also go down. Because the diluting process is very low and some will get into
*                   marine living things and underground mud, so it can make human and livestock in danger
indirectly.
3. Pollution of pesticide to the soil
When excessive pesticide is spread into soil, especially insecticide containing high toxicity and
deserving a long time, it will pollute the soil to some degrees. But the concentration of biology
41



ElS FOR THE CHINA QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT               CRAES 1996
will poison the plants. In item areas there are mainly barren hills and we do not find out the trace
of farm chemical in the control of soil.
4. The effect of pesticide to the mankind
During the process of spreading pesticide, human can be poisoned easily by breath and skin
touching. It is calculated that death events of pesticide farm acute poisoning take place several
*                   hundred. When men drink the water which contains pesticide, they can also be poisoned easily but
the death events are very few.
After the pesticide is accumulated by marine living things and plants, it can pass through the food
chain into the human body, it is accumulated again in the human body and causes human chronic
poison(see Figure 4-1).

4.1.5.2 Prevention of Pesticide Pollution
Spraying pesticide rise to the poisoning and death of person or animal, cause the poison
accumulative in the body. The prevention measure has follow:
1. Pay attention to labor protection , rigidly according to the operator rules to make up a
prescription and spray the medicine , to be cautious to use the pesticide with high toxicity such as
carbofuran, tamaron, etc.
*                  2.The dosage should be just the right amount, select and cultivate the .spices with disease
resistance and spread them. Be cautious to the security period of medicine application, especially
for the fruit kinds, the medicine application should be forbidden in the harvest period ( especially
for the high-persistent pesticides such as tamaron, chlordimeform etc.).
3. Monitor the quality of drinking and mountain embankment water and the rural by-product in
*                  regular time. Ensure that the contain of the pesticide under the standard. Apply more organic

fertilizer, less chemical one, that will reduce the occurrence of pest and disease, and reduce the
amount of using pesticide.
4. Select the phyto-pesticide without toxic develop biological prevention and treatment. Select
new type of pesticides which are low-toxic, low-persistent but high efficacious.
5. Utilization of pesticide must perform strictly" the national standard of pesticide utilizing
safely " ( GB 134285-89 ). Applying pesticide should carry on just as well in the windless, rainless
climate. After using, the appliance of pesticide can not be washed in the natural water, preventing
from the water resource being polluted. The wastewater after washing can not be splashed around.
Please choose the safety place and properly dealing with the appliance which has loaded pesticide
can not be used to contain rural products and other food absolutely. Enhance the education and
publicity about using pesticides secretly among the peasants, popularize some technology, so that
*                   the pesticide would be used secretly, properly, economically and efficiently.
4.1.6 Analysis of Using Plastic Film to Environment
Since China first introduce the technology of plastic cover cultivation, it has been widely used on
cotton, maize, rice, sweet potato, watermelon, potato plants and horticulture and becomes the most
important technical methods of developing high-yield ,high-quality, high-effect agriculture. But
there are also some problems needing to be solved.
*                   4.1.6.1 Beneficial Impacts
First, we can increase the temperature, after covering the plants, in the place of 0-20cm, there have
the effect of increasing temperature which makes plants premature. Second we can keep the water,
so we can increase the water utilized rate to above 80%, to the plastic film maize, keeping water
*                   has the same effect as increasing 300mm  precipitation in the period of growth. Another
advantageous effect of plastic film is to keep the fertilizers and decompose the organic materials
in the soil and to increase the contains of quick-effecting fertilizer. At the same time, it can also
improve the physicochemical character of soil and decrease the hardened and impervious of soil
and unit weight of soil and it can inhibit the weeds in the fields. In the project areas, the yield of
maize in the open air is 200-300 kg per mu and it increases to 400-500 kg after covering the
plastic film.
4.1.6.2 Disadvantageous Impact
After covering the plastic film for a long time, the remain left may affect the growth of plants root
system and will cause the low-yield. At the same time the plastic films affect rain water to seep
into ground, it also easily form the stream and will cause the lose of soil and water .AIl these do
not benefit the improvement of physicochemical character of soil. After being investigated by the
bureau of Government, some kinds of livestock eat plastic film wrongly and death number is
increasing except that the plant yield will decrease. If we do not'take some steps to solve this
problem, not only the grain yield will decrease but it also cause the "white disaster " nationally. To
reduce or control the pollution problem of plastic materials, it is necessary and imminent to use
*                   double-decompose environment-protection plastic to take the place of nowadays plastics.

4.1.6.3 Mitigation Strategy
First, the plastic films can be retrieved by using the old ones in lace of new ones, but we can't burn
them in the retrieved place. Second we can use decomposing plastic films and they can decompose
in a very short time.
0
The photo decompose experiments of Hubby province agriculture technology spreading institute
show: if covering the plastic films from the end period of March to the early period of April and
we see the result in the first ten days of July, first some leaks which appear the same size as green
bean, irregularly small holes and its size is 2-3cm, very few decompose into pieces. The main
*                      character: first leaks often appear when touching and having a very clear sound, the ordinary
plastic films is not easily broken into pieces. Second relatively fast decomposing takes place in
some edge of plastic film when they are in heavy sunlight and the plants grow badly. When plastic
films appear pieces and stick to the surface soil, they can become granary forms if pinching them.
*                      According to some research by Sichuan institution, when the amount of plastic films in the soil go
up to 1/1000, the films less than 6cmx6cm have no effect on the plant yield and the contain weight
of soil and elements. Table4-13 to 4-15 are analysis results of "small soil granule" of test field in

4.1.7 Impact Assessment for Grassland Ecosystem
.
4.1.7.1 Increasing Production Ability of Grassland
Water is imperative for growth of livestock and grass. Many water conservancy installations will
C                   be built to solve drinking and irrigation problem in this project, The investment of which is
135,693,477 RMB yuan. The types and yields of grassland will improve after irrigation. The yield
of irrigation grassland is four or five times more than that of non-irrigation grassland and ten times
more than that of sandy grassland. The grass yield each mu increases to 250-300 kg from less
50kg. The yield of reed and fern can reach more than 500 kg/mu. Therefore, more sheep can be
*                   raised at each hectare grassland.
In order to supply enough food for livestock even if in the winter, Forage grass should be planted
at a large area.
.
Planting shelter-forest can be improve the ability of fixing sand and preventing wind of grassland
and prevents desert eroding grassland. Moreover, reasonable using pesticide and chemical
fertilizer be able to reduce plant diseases and insect pests, enhance soil ability and increase the
production of grassland.
4.1.7.2 Improvement of Livestock Construction
At Ningxia Hui Autonomous, this project supports breeding beech sheep which grows well only
in this area. At west Sichuan province it supports breeding fur sheep, mutton sheep and cattle. The
construction of livestock according to grassland ecological type can make natural ecology
advantage to change economical advantage.
Economical benefit can increase about one time with equal quantity of livestock
by increasing the value of forage and improvement soil type of target region. The growth rate of
livestock will be increase as proportion of sheep, rabbit and cattle is reasonable and the proportion
of basic cow is gained suitably in this project. The case that grassland is injured because of baby
livestock eating low grass will be reduced as the structure of livestock is improved. Desertification
and salinization of grassland is prevented effectively.
.
4.1.7.3 Breeding Livestock Capacity of Grassland
This project aim at extending the area of grassland and planting high-quality grass, meanwhile,
herding is forbidden in the area where ecological system of grassland is weak. With  the
extending of planting area of corps, trees and fruit trees, the supplies of forage are increased.
Nutritious value of forage is improved by the use of combined forage. All above can be reduced
the breeding loan of grassland. For example, at Luopo village of Longquan town of Xuanhan
county of Sichuan province when the breeding sheep project is finished, the actual load of
*                  grassland is 13% of the theoretical livestock load capacity.

4.1.8 Analysis on Impact of Natural Calamities on Agricultural Production
4.1.8.1 Impact of Natural Calamities
l. Drought. Drought can occur in any time of a year but more in spring and summer, which is
*                   more dangerous to crop. There is 823mm precipitation in the project area, which seems to show
that it is enough for grain growing. In fact, the distribution of the precipitation is extremely uneven
temporally. The spring, when grains need water critically, is often dry and even worse the drought
continues to summer. This causes dramatic reduction of grain yield and even no product. It is also
difficult for man and stocks to find water. Therefore, drought is a restricting factor for agricultural
*                   development. Overcoming drought will give the successful start to the project.
2. Flood. Flood results mainly from precipitation with big intensity, large scale and long time.
Affecting factors also include season, location, vegetation, and river etc. Serious flood disaster
occurs every three years average in the project area with, however, no obvious pattern. Its
temporal and spatial distribution variation is largely due to uneven distribution of precipitation. In
summer, flood is formed and rash out farmlands.
3. Frost. Northern or northwestern cold waves come frequently to the project area in winter,
*                   during which the lowest temperature is far below the point that such fruit as orange can survive.
Early frost can make leaves fall and some branches die, which affect booming time.
4. Windstorm. Serious convection of the atmosphere causes thunderstorm, strong wind, hailstone,
and spout phenomena, which come swift and violent and last a very short time.
5. High temperature. Heat, as one of major factor in crop growth, must accumulate to certain
temperature and intensity before crop harvesting. But over high temperature is not adequate.
When temperature is over 35°C, thermophile crops will be inhibited or even harmful. Three-day
*                   hot dry wind with relative humidity less than 60% can be very dangerous to crops.
Season rice can be damaged if daily average temperature is higher than 30°C during its blooming.
Blighted grain increases when temperature is over 35°C and plump grain cannot form when over
38°C. Two-day high temperature (235°C) can reduce 5% of rice yield. In addition, high
temperature can also cause damage to flower of orange and even make flowers and fruits fall.
4.1.8.2 Anti-disaster measures
To many nature disasters, there are many methods to solve them(see Table 4-16).

2. Potential disadvantages
(I)During the construction, excavation of earth and stone can destroy local surface vegetation.
*                   Because it can not be restored promptly, it will cause soil erosion, surface water and ground water
pollution.
(2)Utilization of ground water will have impact on the utilization ratio of water resources.
4.3.2.2 Mitigation and Preventing Measures
We should take countermeasures to remove the disadvantageous impact.
1. Avoid to construct in rainy season. That can avoid the disaster caused by washing of rainstorms.
*                   2. Promptly fill up the gaps produced during the construction, plant grasses and recover vegetation
without delay, avoid soil erosion.
3. Dredge the river timely to assure that the river keeps well-pass.
4. Intensify monitoring of the environment, guarantee the quality of the source of drinking water
4.3.3 Project of Rural Energy Resources and Electricity Supply
Rural energy resources are the material bases of sustained development of rural economy.
Nowadays, most developing countries are facing the shortage of energy resources. In China, the
*                  main rural energy resource is the energy of living beings. So the shortage of rural energy resources
can often cause the destroy of green vegetation. Rural energy resources have close contacts with
natural resource environment. With the increasing need of living being energy, ecological
environment is deteriorating every day. These will check the development of rural economy. The
exploit and consumption of rural energy resources have great impact on environmental quality.
*                   The improper exploitation and utilization of natural resources will cause a series of environmental
problems in country side, such as soil erosion, soil degradation, destroy of vegetation, grassland
degradation and water area silt up. All these are connected with improper exploitation of rural
energy resources.
This program wants to use methane instead of traditional firewood and straws. There will be more
than 1,800 newly built methane tanks.
Most of the environmental impacts of this program are positive effects.
*                   (l()Reduce the pressures on local ecosystem, increases the rates of plant cover, impel natural
ecology to the virtuous cycle, improve the soil fertility.
(2)Reduce the consumption of household fuel and labor intensity of household chores, then reduce
air pollution.
(3)Guarantee the electricity supply of life and production, change the mode of life and production,
raise the living standard and life quality.
(4)Electricity supply will bring about the development of rural trade and service, then alleviate the
poverty of this region.

4.4.1 Major Environmental Impact Analysis of This Program
The impact of this program is mainly on social economical environment.
4.4.1.1. Advantageous Impact
I. Raise family income. It is predicted that 100 yuan of input can produce 500 yuan of output.
*                  2. Impel the development of local post offices.
3. The increase of family income can cause the development of local trade, education, service and
building industry.
4. Impact on local social thoughts, introduce new way of life, get rid of traditional superstitions or
blind faith, increase the status of women.
*   -              4.4.1.2 Potential Disadvantageous Impact
1. The quality of export labor services is comparatively low. They can only do the work of low
income and obtain employment with low stability. They can easily lose their jobs and have to take
another occupation. These will cause some problems of exporting money to cover the cost of
retrieve.
2. The labor export services and the environment of physical labor with high labor intensity will
cause healthy problems and industrial accidents. The economical condition of the labors will make
them not able to afford the cost of healthy problems and serious industrial accidents.
3. The increase of per capita income and rate of employment will make the region more stable.
*                  But it will have negative effects on exporting regions. For example, women have low adaptability,
and they do not have the conscious to protect themselves. They can be exploited, bullied and they
will lose their job easily in unfamiliar environment. Some of them can be forced or induced to
become prostitutes. Some men labors can commit crimes under suffering setbacks.
4.4.2 Mitigation and Preventing Countermeasures
I. Organize the export labor services and train them with plan. Then each of them can master one
or two skills in production.
2. Establish information networks of labor services. Make sure that each labor can do well after
taking an occupation.
3. Enforce the law education, make the labors know how to be self-esteem and self-respect.

5.1.1  Farm and Animal Products Processing
The main impact on environment caused by these enterprises is waste water and organic solid
waste. The main pollutants in waste water are ss, BOD and COD. The exceed waste water
emission will possibly decrease the content of solution oxygen in the water, which will affect the
lives of aquatic animals and hydrophytes.
5.1.2 Mineral Mining and Processing
There are five aspects of impact on environment caused by mineral mining and processing. First,
*                  direct destroy of the ecology of the mining area and the environmental disasters including landslip,
landfall and mud-rock flow caused indirectly by the change of the original form of obsolete
mining area. Secondly, waste water pollution of ore dressing will be a problem. The suspended
matter in the waste water is generally higher than others. Some even develop toxic and harmful
contaminant. For example the systematic development of Ziyang manganese ore, manganese and
*                  chromium pollution the harm done to the aquatic environment by the sulfate and sulfide in the
waste in the productive process of killed barium sulfate and the hidden threat of the solidity of
caudal field dam to the downstream. Thirdly , improper pile of obsolete which will silt water
course. Fourth, dust pollution in the process of mineral power fabrication. dust pollution produced
by the boilers used by enterprises. Finally, explosion and pulverization noise.
5.1.3 Wild Resources Processing
Wild resources can be run out of because of over-utilization in order to make profit from them.
-                 5.2  Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment on Rural Enterprises
Rural enterprises within the project region are mostly farm and forest products processing ones.
Besides, there are some ore processing, construction material and small chemical industrial
*                  enterprises. These processing enterprises are in a small scale and distributed in  a relatively large
area. In the preparatory stage of each sub-project, auditing the environmental impact made by
classified items, identifying those items which have hidden impact on the environment and taking
corresponding reformation measures in general will help to evaluate the feasibility of the project
in the respective of environmental impact. The evaluation results can be seen in Table 5-2.

5.3 Mitigation Measures for the Environmental Impact by Rural Enterprises
.
Sanitary production is a new worldwide trend of pollution control in recent years. It is different
fmm' prevlmo, leratimal co-itro'l im tht stw-y pT'icnkm can, vamiize ThA  mirnmumj pottfioun in
design period in the process of production. Therefore all the rural enterprises included in the
project must introduce sanitary production into the program. Besides, the following measures must
be taken in the project construction.
5.3.1 Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Products Processing
*                   Environmental impact assessment on the project construction must be made by the processing
enterprises of fruits, meat processing, weet-silk, vermicelli and starch whose waste water emission
contains a large amount of suspended matter and BOD. Waste water handling equipment must be
built, which will make it sure that it is capability can make waste water reach emission standards
before it is emitted. For other processing projects like yam, soap material processing, waste water
settling basin must be built. The waste water can only be emitted when it settles and reaches
standards. For solid waste it can be used as feeding stuff for developing animal husbandry or
designed synthetically together with animal husbandry project.
5.3.2 Mining and Minerals Processing
Environment impact assessment on it must be made or environmental impact table must be filled
out for all those mineral mining and processing project which may cause great pollution. The
assessment must include the synthetically argumentation of choosing a site for the project,
*                  whether or not the production program satisfy clean production, the ecological damage of mining
spot, whether or not wastes handling project is feasible, noise pollution problem, tailings site
choosing and the construction scheme and specific feasible measures for environment pollution
prevention. For general mineral mining and processing enterprises, we can brace the angle of
gradient of obsolescent mining field, precipitate waste water, use those field for stone-crater
terrace land or plant trees and grass in obsolete mining field.
5.3.3 Wild Living Things Resources Processing
Cleaning water produced in the resources processing project must be precipitated and emitted
when compliance standards. Production scale must be strictly controlled to prevent the wild
resources from damaging excessively. And at the same time, cultivation and protection plan for
wild resources must be made.
5.4   The Analysis of Typical Cases of Environment Impact Assessment on Rural
Enterprises
Although there are many items of rural enterprises, we can find that their technological processes
are similar based on the preliminary analysis and assessment. So the way of being produced and

(4) Wastewater from the technological flow will be reused and domestic sewage will be treated by
digestion tank.
(5) The solid wastes will be used for road building.
1.9 Environmental Problems
1.9.1 Air Pollution
There are four heating equipment in the plant. Which will emit great amount of smoke dust.
Which will possibly contaminate the local environment because height of the chimney is only
40m and diffusion condition is not good.
1.9.2 Solid Waste
The solid wastes are designed to be used for road building. Which is not concrete. It is
*                 necessary to make a long-term disposal plan to treat it.
61
.



ELS FOR THE CHINA QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY REDUCrION PROJECI          CRAES 1996
1.9.3 Wastewater
*                 Designed utilization of the water is reasonable. But accidentally discharged wastewater has not
been considered.
1.9.4 Utilization of Heat Energy
There are four heating equipment in the plant. But heat energy from the emission has not been
reused.
1.9.5 Flood Block Engineering
There is no any flood block engineering.
*                2 Cleaning Production Design
2.1 Location And Layout
2.1.1 Location
Location of the plant in middle reach of Wuyu valley is better than location in outlet of the valley
because there are less residents living there. However, there a elevated plant base and a flood
preservation embankment to keeping the plant from being destroyed by the biggest flood in a
century are necessary
2.1.2 Layout
*                The production area and living area should be distributed in the direction of north-west
direction because the valley runs the direction of east-west direction. In that way, the product
quality and the living environment will be little affected.
_               2.2 Disposal of the slag
The stone in Zhenan county is more than earth and most building materials are bricks. But
earth used for brick ma.king is not enough. The particle of slag from the plant is very small.
Which can be used for brick making. Therefor, we recommend that four brick making machines
are bought and all the slag is used for brick making. In the case 10,000 bricks can be produced
by the plant daily and the annual profit is 300,000 yuan RMB. Certainly the slag is no more a
pollution source.
2.3 Chimney
*               The chimney should be heighten to 55m. Which will expand the diffusion area and mitigate
emission concentration.
2.4 Resources use
2.4.1 Dust Removal
The are lots of dusts from raw material pulverizing and processed material grinding. Which
should be removed by shower or water screen and the raw and processed materials can be
recovered by wastewater settling. Simultaneously, the water after settling can be recycled. From
this process the raw materials and processed materials which are worth about 300,000 yuan
*              RMB will be recovered.
62
.



EIS FOR THE CHINA QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT            CRAES 1996
2.4.2 Wastewater
*                  Wastewater from boiler cycling will be used for the dust removal and bricks making. The
domestic sewage will be treated by digestion tank and discharged.
2.4.3 Reuse of Heat Energy
(1) Double-efficiency evaporator will replace boiling cauldrons in sodium recovery process. By
which one third of energy will be saved.
(2) 36m reverse stove will be applied and high temperature smoke (500 oC) will be recovered by
installing recovery boiler at chimney. By which 10% of the fuel consumption can be saved.
2.4.4 Change of Fuel Structure
Designed heavy oil as a fuel in the roasting and drying process can mitigate emission of sulfur
dioxides and dust. However. installation of a dry coal gas generating station will solve all fuel
*                  problems of the plant and mitigate air pollution.
2.5 Design of The Technological Flow
(1) Taking the place of phosphoric acid with sulfuric acid in the acid washing process, by which
the acid consumption will be reduced to lkg/l from the original 10kg/l. Simultaneously,
emission amount of hydrogen sulfide will be reduced greatly.
(2) A extra wastewater pool should be built in order to store wastewater discharged accidentally.

The table above suggests that the first alternative has many advantages over the others,
especially the influence on environment. Therefor, the first alternative is recommended here.
Influences of which on the environment are mainly plant destroy and soil erosion. Landslide,
collapse and mud-rock flow are possibly caused by storms accidentally.
*                  2.2 Disposal of Solid Wastes
The solid wastes of the plant are waste ore and stripped ores. The amount of which are showed
in table 2-2.
From the table 2-2 we learn that opening conditions of the nine is at a higher level.
For disposal of the waste ores, there is a valley named Chenjiagou in west side of the stope.
Where the waste ores can be collectively piled. Which will be covered with soil and planted
When the piled waste ores reach to a designed height. However, There are still some influence of
the waste ores on environment because 50,000 ton of the waste ore is a huge amount and the
*                  service-life is about 20 years.

Major influences of the mine are:
(1) Destroying plants and changing the original landscapes;
(2) Occupying land and changing the original landschaft;
*                 (3) Intensifying soil erosion;
(4) Increasing potential chance of collapses, landslide and mud-rock flow.
3 Design of Cleaning Production
3.1 Restoration of The Eco-environment
Principles of the cleaning production design is that the mining scale should be rational; plant
destroy and soil erosion should be minimum and both environment and economy develop in a
favorable way. Based on the principles, design of cleaning production during the service-life is
listed in table 3-1.

3.2 Restoration of The Eco-environment after Service
Principle of cleaning production design beyond the service-life is to restore eco-environment like
the original as possible as it can.
*                 The cleaning production design is showed in table 3-2.
3.3 Investment
From the table 3-1 and 3-2 we learn that the investment is yearly 150,000 yuan RMB during
the mining period.

5.5 Prevention Measures of Pollution of Rural Enterprises
The main factors causing pollution by the rural enterprises are the discharge of waste gas, water
and solid, and noise etc. The waste treatments of each enterprise should be comprehensively
considered based on the amount and the way of emission and the surroundings of its site, and
*                   select the best efficient plan. About this part there has been detailed recount in the chart of the
environmental impact analysis of rural enterprises, here is a summary.
5.5.1 Countermeasures of Water Pollution Control
*                   1. Adopt pollution free production, do best to save the water resource improve the utilization
efficiency of the industrial recycling water, reduce the discharge of wastewater to the lowest
degree.
2. Adopt advanced treatment technology, control the discharge amount of the wastewater strictly,
perform the standards to abate the environmental pollution caused by industrial wastewater.
5.5.2 Countermeasures of Air Pollution Control
*                   1. Do best to select the type of coal which contains less sulfur in order to abate the emission of
sulfur dioxides.
2. Control strictly the gas pollutants emission, using all kinds of desulfurization and dust removing
facilities, abate the sulfur dioxide and the dust emission amount of industrial boiler.
J
5.5.3 Countermeasures of Solid Wastes Pollution Control
The solid wastes in the project mainly come from the coal cinder of the boiler. The cinder can be
*                   used as crude building materials such as making brick, also can be used for surfacing a road,
filling the puddle and so on, to reduce the cinders pilling in open air. Moreover, in the processing
of making rural by-products, the waste should be comprehensively utilized.
5.5.4 Counterrneasures of Noise Control
.
Noises mainly come from all kinds of mechanical equipment, reduce the harmful effects of noises
on human health by building separated workplaces, the sound-proof wall insulation. Using the
sound absorption facilities, afforest the factory area etc.

5.6 Develop the Total Quantity Control of Pollutants Discharge from Rural Enterprises
To implement the total quantity control of pollutant is needed for assuring the achievement of "the
ninth five years" objective in environmental protection. It is the inevitable tendency in ensuring
and improving environmental quality.
.
The China Qinba Mountains Poverty Reduction Project has total 171 rural enterprises, they are
distributed in 26 national focal point county assisting poverty. Because no environmental pollution
had been regarded as key standard of project selection in the distinguishing stage of the project, it
has been concerned about adopting the production process pollution-free or providing the
treatment measures necessary the discharge amount of rural enterprises. In addition to that the
rural enterprises are scattered, single project's environmental effect to water and air in the area
where they site is light is all very small.
*                   According to the particular conditions of rural enterprises, the following measures would be sure
to be adopted in the total amount control of pollutant discharge.
1. Require every rural enterprises implementing strictly the discharge standards of the nation or
the region and the regulation about "three works in the same time" of capital construction, every
*                   kind of pollutant must emit under the standard.
2. Require the new project construction on the old factories base treating the old pollution source,
assure that the total amount of discharge do not increase after the new construction.
3. Be carefully select the factories site distributed rationally, control the discharge of the factory
under the total quantity control plans of every county, not causing local pollution.
4. Develop the pollution-free production, adopt the advanced production process and treatment
*                   technology worldwide, reduce the discharge to the lowest extent.
5. Adjust the total quantity of emission in the region, do not surpass the regional total quantity
controlling objective.
In Shaanxi province, there are 181 enterprises called "five small" being forced to close according
to the State Council's document number 31 (1996). The "three wastes" discharge amounts of those
enterprises in the follow Table 5-5, that of the new enterprise in the Table 5-6. From the tables, we
can see that the amount discharged by new enterprises is far below that of the closed enterprises .

6.2.4 Analysis of the newly increased productivity of the project
1. 171 processing factories are built or rebuilt when the project is carried out. Among these, there
*                   are 8 mining and processing factories, 8 building material processing ones, 53 processing ones for
agriculture produces and their by-products, I forage processing one, 16 tea processing ones, 12
processing ones for fresh fruits, 15 for livestock products, 9 manual enterprises, 14 for woods
products, I reeling mill, 13 for others. Besides, 21 markets for agricultural trade are built. The
processing and manufacturing capability within the project region will be greatly increased.
.
2. 6,375 ha. dry farm land are supported to be reformed and so are 8,309 ha. paddy fields,
23,741hectare stone-banked terrace fields. 9,476 ha. sloping fields are transformed into terrace
fields.
3. During the period of carrying out the project for forest fruits and cultivating, 12,010 ha area for
cultivating economic plants is increased. 1,882 ha. low productive tee plantation is reformed.
mulberry field will be 4,915 ha. Other forest fruits fields will be 28,655 ha. .

broods of hares, 344,548 domestic animal supported to be raised by the project . Livestock
products of many kinds will be greatly increased.
5. 774 km village roads will be built and 119 km of old road will be reformed, which increases
road-towns from 411 to 450. When the project is finished, these are roads across all towns with
79
.



EIS FOR THE CHINA QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY REDUJCTION PROJECT               CRAES 1996
road villages increasing from 1,805 to 2,228, which can improve the transportation condition of
villages within the project region.
6. 12,061 drinking water projects for men and livestock will be built, including 6,290 man-made
wells and 965 water-storing pods, 1,237 drinking water cellar. 20,483 water conservancy projects
of small kinds are built, including 8 irrigation projects, I reservoir, 21,566 tiny irrigation cellars,
*                   2,000 tiny irrigation wells, 15 machine wells. All of those basically solve the drinking problems of
52,360 people and 396,000 livestock within the project region.
7. The productivity of small power plants is increased by 2,175 kilovolts. 669 km of 10 kilovolts
transmission and transferring lines are built or reformed and so are 75 km of those of 35 kilovolts
*                   One transforming substation and 1,828 marsh gas pools are built.
By carrying out the project, the resource advantage is made fully use of within the project region.
And so is the labor force. The infrastructure and basic productive conditions will be much better.
The productivity and economic benefit is greatly improved, which makes the production and
living standards apparently rise.
When the project is put into production, both the nation and the people within the region can have
more income. Tax can be increased and within 20 years it can totally amount to 2,993,791,790
-                   yuan. In the 6th year when the project is being carried out, according to the fixed prices of 1990.
income per person in the region is increased from less than 320 yuan in 1995 to more than 500
yuan, with food per person increased from 266.6 kg in 1995 to 397 kg and the area of basic farm
land per person from 0.2 ha. in 1995 to 0.3 ha.
0                   6.2.5  Assessment of Social Benefit
Carrying out the project betters the productive conditions with cultivated land, forest land, grass
land, mulberry field and tea plantation greatly increased, the commodity economy quickly
*                   developed, the steps of the peasants from poverty to rich quickened, which produces good benefit
of helping poor people and obvious social benefit.
1. At the end of the 6th year, the net income per person per year within the region will be
increased to 509 if calculated on the fixed prices in 1990, which is increased by 210.6 yuan. Food
*                   production per person is increased to 397 kg, almost 50% higher than before. Meat production per
person will be increased from 33 kg in 1995 to 42.1 kg. in 2001. The production of other
agricultural products will be increased to different extents. Carrying out the project will make the
income increase greatly and people have enough food. which is good for the social security and
unity.
2. It will make a base for the social economic continued development to carry out the employment
project. Developing the productive project will guide the people into the construction actively and
lessen the social pressure caused by the reduction of land because of population growth and low
*                   agricultural comparative benefit. The exploitation of land and farmers, town-village enterprises,
80



EIS FOR THE CHINA QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT                CRAES 1996
markets for agricultural trade and the exportation of labor create jobs for surplus labor of the
project region. For example in Shaanxi Province, 49,300 jobs can be increased in agriculture. The
second and third estates will have 33,300 jobs for people. The development of the project and the
exportation of labor in the region can basically solve the employment problem of 118,000 surplus
labors within the region in the province. And it can also make people better informed and
knowledged. The good settlement of the rural surplus labor is good for social security.
3. The infrastructure project supports the construction of farm land irrigation facilitates, drinking
water project for men and livestock, power project and village roads etc. The irrigation facilitates
mainly refers to reservoirs of small kinds, ponds, irrigation ditches and pumping stations etc.
which do good to changing from dry farm land to paddy fields and to increasing the insurance rate
*                   of irrigating the original cultivated land to improve the food production. The drinking problem of
men and livestock can be solved by building diversion channels, setting up diversion pipelines,
reservoirs and pumping stations, Erecting transmission lines, and building water power station etc.
can serve the production and lives in the region, and improve the development of the 2nd and 3rd
estates. Building roads across villages and joining them with built roads of county  class is
good for the project region to have a relationship with outside and to improve the transportation.
When the project is finished, the road line will be increased from 8,670 km to 9,444 kin, and the
administrative villages where roads are across will amount to 2,228, more than 70% of all in the
region. 404 tycoons can use electricity, increased by 10.98%.
*                   Water conservancy facilities can solve the irrigation problems of 7,680 ha. farm land and also
mitigate the difficulty of drinking water for people. The growing completion of the infrastructure
can basically satisfy the needs of people's life which a substantial base for further social
development.
4. When the project is carried out, a village system of science and technology, circulation service
is basically formed. It can be realized that each town has its own comprehensive service station,
each village has agriculture technical station and each natural village has its own model. The rural
supplying and selling system and other economic service bodies are formed into a very good
c                   Network. This corresponding service system is most important for scientific cultivating and
breeding, popularizing advanced and proper technology, technology education and improving
peasants scientific and technological knowledge and the quality of people. And 21 markets for
agricultural trade are built will also do good to improving the commodity ratio of agricultural
products, speeding up the development of rural commodity economy, making the rural market
*                   brisk and enrich the material life of people in the region, which means it is very important.
6.2.6 Ecological Benefit Assessment
This project is one of the project which goes both over-regional and sectional engineering. It is
based on the model of suiting measures to local conditions, overall planning and diversified
undertakings, When it is carried out, the development of cultivating breading will promote
agricultural products processing business, make full use of the advantages of light and heat
resources, promote better use of land and improve the probability of fighting natural calamities, all
*                   of which will help to change the ecological economy into a fine circle.

EIS FOR THE CHINA QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT                CRAES 1996
The project is programmed and designed according to both of principle that in the develop rural
social economy and poverty reduction in the region become rich and that pollution must be
decreased and the environment must be protected to promote to promote the benign circle of
agricultural productive system and ecology to have a good ecological benefit.
*                   1. It is reviewed by the Environmental Protection Bureau that the economic technological design
of the project is reasonable.
It can not only promote the economic development in the region, but also pays attention to
promoting the continued coordinate development of the agricultural productive system and
*                  ecological protection system. The project regions are mainly distributed in poor villages in
faraway mountain area. They are scattered. The construction is disperse and the constructors only
have a fluidity which will not pollute the environment. They pay attention to smooth land, land
and water preservation. They will not destroy original florae. These measures will also help
e                  protect and control soil erosion.
2. The measures of agriculture and the synthetic development project of cultivated field can
improve local ecological environment. The increase of amount of chemical fertilizer and farm
chemical used in the cultivated land has little negative effect on the environment because of the
*                  powerful service system which guide farmers to carry out the provisions and operating program.
Measures are taken to change the used agricultural membrane into the new to be sure that the old
is retrieved, or to popularize the use of degradable agricultural membrane as wide as possible to
decrease " white pollution". The reformation of coordinating the water, gas, manure and heat to
create a benign can circle of soil ecological environment and to enrich synthetically the land, The
-                  project of changing sloping field into terrace fields and of woods, fruits mulberry, tea and
Medicare Herb's plantation can both promote the development of the commodity economy in the
regions and also protect water and soil, reserve the source of water to improve the coverage rate of
forest, adjust the climate, purify the environment, change the situation of soil erosion and promote
the benigin circulation of environment.
3. a great amount of organic manure will be produced for agriculture in the regions with the
development of breeding which will decrease environmental pollution if retrievcd to the cultivated
field. And it can also better the soil and increase the amount of organic matter in it to improve
good circulation of the 12 natural ecological system in the regions.
4. Pay full attention to the estates with no pollution or low pollution when town village enterprises
choose what they will manufacture or process. Choose the kind of estate which is also small and
scattered. For the projects which could possibly produce waste gas, water and dregs etc., the
principle of clean program, construction and production to protect the environment must be
strictly obeyed. Waste water, waste gas pollution and dross must be strictly controlled to
compliance the national standards and to avoid the creation of new pollution source.
*                  5. For the construction of infrastructure, it must be prevented from  destroying the natural
82

EIS FOR THE CHINA QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT               CRAES 1996
protection area when dealing with the land and making pits. Protecting slants and drain ditches
must be taken enough care of and be carried out to construct during the period with less rain.
Construction should be made along with the level line as possible as you can and surface runoff
should be prevented from washing out new earth. All kinds of measures taken make it sure that
the natural environment will not be destroyed and that the coordination of construction and
environment and a benign circulation will be promoted.

6.2.7 Comprehensive Benefit Assessment
The project produces apparent comprehensive benefit when carried. The project region covers
vast area of Sichuan Province, Shaanxi Province and Ningxia Autonomous District. There are 26
x                  counties, 361 towns and 2,941 administrative villages. It makes the income per person and the
elementary farm land per person of 2,330,000 poor people apparently increase, which is an
obvious benefit of helping poor people. The newly increased amount of agricultural products
including its specialties and processed products will have great effect on the further development
of the social economy. The projects mainly with biographical measures can promote the water and
soil conservancy and improve the ecological environment to make production and environment
develop coordinately, and circulate properly. The synthetically construction will better the living
conditions and productive conditions of 350,000 poor people in the project region and its
surroundings which will make it a great model of helping poor people.
6.3 Environmental Protection Investment of the Project
6.3.1 Investment
Following related items of environmlental protection investmenit of  4( The Provisions of
Environmental Protection Program of Construction Projects )) (87) National Environment No.002
of the People's Republic of China. Associated with the environmental protection measures and
plan put up in this report. The environmental protection investment of the project in this respect
*                  will tentatively be 4%-6% of the total. It is mainly used in the items followed.
(1) (Ground film) Plastic reprocessing;
(2) The afforesting of the area of infrastructure construction (including the infrastructure of
cultivated land, roads and diversion channel etc.);
(3) The environmental administering project of rural enterprise;
*                  (4) Environment surveillance:
(5) Environment protection training;
(6) The environmental management.
6.3.2  Economic loss and benefit
The effect of the development of natural resources on the environment can be recognized as the
cost of developing resources within permitted range. Therefore, the cost of reducing, avoiding and
tackling the environmental effect, known as environmental protection investment, in a certain kind
v                  of condition, can be recognized as development lost which will be counted into the project
83

EIS FOR THE CHINA QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT               CRAES 1996
investment and be analyzed economically.
*                   The environmental protection investment of the project is 4%-6% of the total investment, lower
than the standard of 10% of increasing and decreasing investment of financial sensitive analysis of
the project. So the investment will not affect the economic benefit of the whole project.
*                   6.3.3  Comprehensive Analysis of the Loss and Benefit of the Investment
Generally, environmental protection investment can produce relatively greater environmental,
economic and social benefit. It can be explained by the example of Jinbao Vermicelli Mill of
Jialing District of Nanchong City, Sichuan Province.
6.3.3.1  Investment
Jinbao Vermicelli Mill produces 1,500 tons of vermicelli per year. The total investment is
3,400,000 yuan. About 162.7t/d waste wvater is emitted after the productive process of cleaning,
separation, fining and decolorization. This emission is made after the waste water reaches required
standards after aerobic and anaerobic biochemical processing. The waste gas of coal-fired boiler is
emitted out of a 20-meter chimney after dust removal made by dust removers. Dross of pieces of
yam after the process of pressing and baking is changed  into feeding stuff to be sold. The
*                  investment in the waste handling equipment is about 170,000 yuan, which will be 5% of the total
amount.
6.3.3.2 Benefit
In utilizitg the three kinds of industrial waste, waste water produced biochemically is emitted after
reaching the standards, which means that the water resources can be utilized with no need to pay
for the emission. A profit of 7,322 yuan can be made from this .Waste gas after the process of dust
removal is emitted out of the 20 m shaft, which decrease the pollution of atmospheric environment.
This can reduce the diseases of local people caused by pollution. Which means the medical cost
of 2.000 yuan will be saved. 1,470 tons of yam dross is produced every year. The change from the
dross to feeding stuff can decrease environmental pollution and have some economic value.
Calculated at the price of 0.20/kg, the yearly benefit is 294,000 yuan. Totally we can make the
economic beneftt of 303,322 yuan per year from the environmental protection investment. If the
*                  cost of the maintenance of environmental protection facilities energy and transportation is
excluded out, the net benefit of the environmental protection is 151,661 yuan. Then we can
retrieve the cost of environmental protection environment within 1.12 years.
6.3.3.3  Comprehensive Assessment
303,322 yuan can be earned from the environmental protection facilities if they work properly and
the net income is 151,661. The effect on the environment and human bodies mode by wastewater,
waster gas and dross is decreased. After the environmental protection investment is compensated,
the left yearly income can be used either in expanded reproduction or in helping the poor people to
*                  unify the benefit of society, environment and economy.

Chapter 8  Public Participation
Public participation is a necessary part of EIA on the projects loaned by the World Bank, which
requires full considerations for demands and suggestions of the organizations, community, and
local non-governmental organizations (NGO). During EIA, public participation and expertise
*                  consultation should be helpful to understanding of the nature and scale of social, environmental
and economic influences of the project. These works can make the project planning and designing
more reasonable and perfect and thus bringing more environmental and economic benefits.
8.1 Ways and Contents of the Public Participation
Three ways of public participation are adopted in the EIA, i.e. expert consultation, symposium,
and questionnaire. Participants of questionnaire are listed in Table 8-1.
Table 8-1 Participants of question aire

8.2 Working Procedure of Public Participation
Public participation have been lasting throughout whole EIA process (see Figure 8- 1).
8.3 Conclusions of Public Participation
1.  The investigation of public participation got extensive support from personalities of various
circles and all participants showed great enthusiasm. 3,0282 articles of questionnaires out of
3,500 were returned, accounting for 88%. The number of participants in questionnaire,
symposium, and consultation is near 5,000, of which, 58% are male and 42% female. Results
of thc investigation can primarily embody opinions and suggestions of community and NGO.
See Table 8-2 for detail.
2.  In the investigation, 92%  of participants support and understand the poverty reduction
projects, and 90% of them thought the projects are advantageous to the local economy. Those
who are opposite and indifferent worried about weather or not the loan allocation follows the
designed projects and the loan is really used for poverty reduction.
*                  3.  When asked for suggestions to the overall planning of the project, 93% of participants
90

EIS FOR THE CHINA QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT               CRAES 1996
opponents wanted to increase the portion of rural enterprises for it is the fastest way getting
profits. The experts suggested that the weak ecosystem in the Qinba Mountain Area can only
*                       be improved by preventing water and soil loss, increasing area of plantation and forestry, and
thus enhancing resources for the rural enterprises. And then the social economy, ecosystem,
and natural environment can develop in a sustainable way.
*                  4.  Large difference was found in answers to the question of "how about existing environmental
protection facilities?". Only 70% of answers are '"Good", which showed deep concern of the
public to the present treatment of pollution in project units.
5.  In places with most minority population in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, over 80% of
minority people thought their benefits and religious believes are considered and respected in
the projects, and the projects can also take advantages of the local handicraft industry and
*                       livestock. There are 4% wanted more investment in the rural enterprises of Ningxia.
6.  Most of the public expressed deep concern in negative impacts of the projects construction
on environment and production.
0
7.  Some of the public wanted the project implementation to bring improvement of
environmental quality with high hopes. They also hoped the rebuilding or extension projects
can pay their debts in environmental protection.
8.  During visiting investigation in typical project zonie, most of villagers have realized that one
of the reasons of poverty is water shortage and another one is over cultivation of lands. So
*                      they wanted to transfer paddy fields into fish pools and slope lands into orchards. We did not
support any ideas reducing farmlands, but we did approve crop rotation, fishing in paddies,
and fruit growing in wastelands and courtyards. Most of the villagers paid great attention to
how much money they can get after the approval of the loan project. They wanted more cash
at first year in order to buy necessary farm implements.
9.  Some experts put forward some good suggestions on conserving water and biology resources,
*                      improving utilization of resources, adopting latest technologies, planning overall locations of
the projects, and building roads, etc. Constructive suggestions have been considered in the
measures of environmental protection.

In one word, experts, community, and representatives of social organizations reached unanimity at
*                 that the project can change the backward situation of the Qinba Mountains Area. They hoped that
the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty alleviation should put the project into affect as
soon as possible. Possible problems in the project can be resolved gradually in its implementation.

EIS FOR THE CHINA QINBA MOUNTAINS POVERTY REDUCTION PROJECT               CRAES 1996
Chapter 9    Conclusion and Suggestion
9.1 Natural and ecological environment is very poor in the project region. Per capita income is
less 320 RMB yuan. Aid is imperative.
*                  9.2 Land and farmer development project will make positive contribution to the regional
ecological and environmental qualities. The control strategies for soil erosion and improvement
targets of soil fertility, raising the load livestock capacity of the grassland, and environmental
protection countermeasures of prevention and control pesticide and ground film are feasible and
practicable.
9.3 The suitable development of rural enterprises will be benefit to local resources developing.
The cleaning production techniques and compliance discharge techniques will keep the minimum
negative environment effects.
9.4 The living condition of 3.5 million poor people who living in the project areas and surround
areas will be improved thoroughly. The social, economic and environmental benefits are
significant.
*                  9.5 Experts, delegate of mass organization and public of the project areas believe generally that
this project will be helpful to improve the ecological environment of Qinba mountains area and
will increase the income and make people lifted out of poverty and backwardness.
To sum up, this project is clear in objectives, benefits significant, feasible to the environment and
supported by public. It is suggested that the implement will be started earlier.
