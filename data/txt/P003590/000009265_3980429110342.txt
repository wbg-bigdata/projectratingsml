1. Preface
1.1 The Project Backgrournd
Xiji, Haiyuan, Tongxin, Jingyuan, Guyuan, Pengyang, Longde and Yanchi counties in Ningxia southern mountainous area
are located at the transitional zone of arid and semi-arid zones of northwest of Chinma. The average annual rainfall in most
part of the area is less than 400 mm. However, over 70% falls during July to September, the natural rainfall could not
meet the basic demand of the crops growing. The drought fiequency is over 70% and the area is suffering from little
precipitation and intensive evaporationi. The natural conditions are bad and the economic basis is weak. People are living in
dire poverty. Now the population density had already been 54%/sq. krn, which was 2.7 timnes of the international critical
umdicator used in the arid and semi-arid areas. The land is overloaded with population and the contradiction between people
and natural environment is very big. The area is one of the poorest areas in our country.
*                In 1983, the Central Government began to calTy out a special agricultural program and the.strategy of poverty ahleviation
in the " Three West" area. Through over the ten years' development and execution of poverty alleviation, the passive
situation of the agricultural production has been turned round initially and also the poverty situation has been eased up. The
Government action has laid a foundation for the farmers in Southern Ningxia to alleviate poverty and bring about prosperity.
However, as the production condition has not been improved completely in most parts of 8 counties, in addition, the natural
calamities there are frequent and there are still about 700,000 people with income below 320 yuan. The proportion of the
area and population in poverty are 5 8% and 44% of the Regional total. This is the only case in China.
The economic development in Ningxia is slow and the local financial income is low. It is difficult for Ningxia to support
e                those farmers to alleviate the poverty as fast as possible. In order to change the situation of these poor areas in southern
Ningxia quickly and achieve the goals of the "National 87 poverty alleviation program" as scheduled, the State Council
Poverty Alleviation Office, National Planning Commission and the Mimistry of Finance exchanged views with the World
Bank and agreed to list Qinba Poverty Reduction project into the World Bank loan plan, and decided to select Xiji, Haiyuan,
Tongxin, Jingyuan counties which are the poverty-striken area with more Hui nationality needed to be supported greatly in
*                southem Ningxia as the project area.

(2). Grain crops:
During six years' construction, the project would develop 18,226 ha. of crops area, in which, wheat, mulch corn, virus-
*               free potato and legume would be planted.
(3). Cash crops:
About 292S ha. of cash crops including linsced, mulch watermelon and Chinese onion would be grown in Xiji and
Tongxin counties.
B. Livestock raising:
About 17,797 heads of cows, 95,445 heads of sheep and 7,730 heads of pigs would be  raised in four project counties and
*              Also 2,782 ha. of grassland would be planted.
By making full use of resources of forage provided by planting, the straw of crops would be converted into animal
products. It can not only meet the increasing demands of society, but also increase meat supply and provide sufficient raw
material for animal products proessing. It can also create a permanent income source for farmers and increase capital
accumulation, extend investment intensity in planting. Meanwhile, it can provide sufficient organic fertilizer for food
crops cultivation but also reduce the pollution to the environment. It will generate organic content of soils and soil fertility,
and also keep balance of soil and manure, bring the production superiority into full play.
C. Forestry:
About 716 ha. of timber forest and fruit trees, i.e. apricot, apple and date trees and other trees would be planted in Haiyuan
and Tongxin counties and 986 ha. of forest for water and soil conservation would be planted in Xiji, Haiyuan and Tongxm
counties, also 3 00 ha. of conifer forest would be planted in Jingyuan couity.
D. Scientific and Teclulical Service:
The scientific and technical service includes technical extension and training, also the support service.
2.4.2 The Rural Enterprises Development Component

2.5. The project technical design 
The selection of the project technical designi would be based oni the priniciples as follows: The first one is the technical
designi of the agriculture development, according to the capability of the farmiers, the advanced practic-al production
technology would be adopted by every means and at the sam-e time, the fine varieties anid better pla-ntinig methiods would be
extenided greatly. The second onie is that the advanced technology and equipmtent both from domnestic and abroad would be
folly used in tie rnaral enter-prises so that the production efficiency and the comprehiensive betnefits could be enhaniced. The
third one is that the teclimical designi of the nioni-productive projects would be carried out in accordanice with the realizationi
of the project objectives and the actual demands of the povesty-stricken farmner househiolds. The last one is that the emnphasis
instist be.placed oii the work of th-e techniical personniel and the farmiiers training in the technical design of all sub-projects.
Based oni the capability of the farmners, all technical designi would be easy to operate and usefulI for thAeir productioni
activities.
The characteristics of the farmers' low quality anid th-e skill in product ioni isave beeni considered fully in the selection of the
project technical design. The arrangemic t of agriculture would be carried out according to the demeands of low productionA
techinology aid miore plting experiences of the fainers and extensive sub-projects in ianagesnent. As the special
deininids of the processing g industries, some processing industries would be areraneud in rIe tovaiships and suburbs witli

*                 The investmeslt for the fu-st year accounts for 15.63% of the total;  for the second year accotunts for 20.27%; for the third
year 19.74% ;the fousrth year 19.76%; the fifth year 14.77% and the sixth year accoumts for 9.83%.
2.8. The Project Organization and Management
The project organization and management will play a decisive role for the implementation of such a special, complicated,
comprehensive and long-term project. To certain extent, the realization of the project objectives relys on the project
inistitutional construction and management capability. Adhering to the principles of rationalization, coordination and high
efficiency, the organization setting up and the determination of their functions of responsibilities must be able to satisfy the
0                 requirements of project planning, fmancial management, material management, technical training, monitoring, etc. The
well-established organizations and qualified staff together with effective regulations can make tip a project management
mechanism. Ningxia project organization and management is given in chart 2-3

3. The General Situationi of the Environuient in the Project Area.
*               3.1. Natuiral Environmlent
The location of 4 project coiuties is within 105°17' -- 106039' east longitude, and 35°14'-- 37013'' north latitude with the
total area 7,107.28 Km2. The Liupan Mountain ( an elevation of 2,931 m) stretches from south to noith and is joined with
the Yeliang Mountain ( an elevation of 2,632 m), Nanhua Moumtain ( an elevation  of 2,954 m ) and Xihua Mountain (an
elevation of 2,703 m ). The area is almost of mountains with steep slopes, valleys and undulating ground everywhere and
the topographical features there is quite bad. Geographical location of Ningxia project area is given in attached map 1.
The greater part of the project areas is situated in the loess plateau and in the region of continental monsoon climate. It is
*               located at the transitional zone of arid and semi-arid zones of northwest of China with its topography raising from the north
to the south. The rainfall decrease gradually from south to north while the evaporation and sun-shine time increase from
south to north. The soil is primarily soft loess, mixed with darlk and brown ealth, loaml and sierozem.  Average
temperature in 40 years is 7 'C, the highest temperature is 38 'C and  the lowest one is -23'C. The accumulated
temperature cover 10 'C is 2,485 'C and the fiost-free period is 150 days. The rainfall is 434 nuni but the evaporation is
*                  1,884 nunl. the highest height is 2,955 m and the lowest one is 1,260 m and thne average one is 1.888 m. With the isophet of
400 mm rainfall having a slant pass across Ningxia from the northeast to southwest, the project area is clearly divided into
two different natural areas.
,*              (1). The high, cold, shady and moist area: It is located in earthen and stony hilly area which is at the eastern foot of Liupan
Moumtain, with 5 towns of Jingyuan Cotmty included. The elevation level reaches to 2,275m with its relative height ranging
between 800--1500m. The annual rainfall is 650 mm with its guarantee rate of above 500 mun reaching S5%, and its arid
degree is around 1 . The accumulated temperature over 10 C is  1900 to 2000 with the average daily temperature in the
warmest month reaching 17.4C, and -7°C in the coldest month. The annual sumshine time is about 2,237 hours and the
*               frost-free period is 132 days. The area is suitable for meat cattle and sheep raising.
(2) Semi-arid Project Area, under which two types are further divided:
a). Warm and Cool Semi-arid Area
The project area is located between mountainous and loess hilly areas which covers 9 townships of Xiji County and 4
townships of Haiyuan County. Within the territory, Yelling Mountain is 2,632m above sea level, with the elevation of other
mountains ranging 1900--2300m and their relative height between 100--300m. The topographical conditions varies sharply
*                with the ditches, gullies and ridges crisscrossed all over. The ridges are very steep and the depth of the gullies varies
between 80--300m. 'the guarantee rate for the annual rainfall over 400 mm is only 60%, the arid degree is around 1.4--2.0.
The accumulated temperature over 10 C is between 1700-- 2500VC, with the average daily temperature in the warmest
month reaching 17.8 C, and -9.2'C in the coldest month. The annual sunshine time is about 2,300 hours and the frost-free
period is 150 days. -This area is suitable for raising cattle, pig and sheep.
B). Windy and Sandy Semi-arid Area
The project area is on a chain of undulating loess hills which covers altogether 13 townships, 5 townships of Haiyuan
*                County, such as Shuanghe, Xutao, Songehuan, Zhengqi and Luochuan and 8 townships of Tongxin County. The general
elevation is ranging 1500--1800m with the relative height between 30--lOOm. The landformn is crisscrossed with ditches,
15
.



gullies and dunes, with its slope of 10--20 degrees. The annual rainfall ranges between 200--300 mm . The annual stunshine
timne is about 3,000 hours and the frost-free period is 165 days.
The differences of geographical location and topography of some regions in the project area result in veoy differences in
climate. The major climate conditions in the project area is givcn in table 3-1.

The average annual temperature in the project area increase from south to north and the change is between 5 'C           0
and 9 'C. The differences between warm and cold, years and days are great. The Tainfall decrease from north to
south and the change is between 650 mm and 200 mm. The change ofthe rainfall between time , season and year is
quite big and the guarantee of the rainfall is low. the arid degree increases from south to north gradually and the
change is between 1 and 3.4. The annual sunshine time increase from south to north and the change is between 1900
and 3000 hours. The difference is quite obvious. The evaporation is very strong and the winter time is long and cold
but the surmmer time is short and hot with less snow and rain. this is the characteristics of the area.
3.2 Natural Disasters
The natural environment in the project areas is bad and the water and soil loss is serious. The development of production is
hindered greatly. The disasters of drought, hail, storn, flood and freezing are the main factors limiting the agricultural
development. The drought, in particular, create the grcat disaster for the agriculture production because it is frequent there
in Spring -- the sowing season and it effects the crops growing greatly. Though the rainfall in the project areas is over 400
mnn, but it concentrates in the Autwun. So the flood in Autumn occurs frequently and the water and soil loss is serious, the
grain production, naturally, reduces greatly . The heads of gulleies is stretching rapidly. The arable land is eroded and the
fertility of soil becomes sharply weak and natural environment is gradually deteriorating.
3.3 The Social and Economic Situation
.
The social economy in this project area used to take agriculture as its priority, with the nrual management sticking to the
traditional farming methods and animals raising. The grain production is low and smstable as the limitation of the natural
16
.



conditions and also the low miput. The tovwinslhip enterprises developed slowly, and characterized as narrow scope of
industries, inadequate employment, sirnple economic structure and low level of production.

3.4 The Development Condition and Resources Evaluation
3.4.1 The Development Condition:
(1). The project area is rich in land, sunshine and heat resources. In the project area, there are various types of soil which
has widely adaptability and great potentiality to  develop. The cultivated land amounts to 131,232.87 ha. The shares of
cultivated land of 0.91 mu per rural resident and 4.89 mu. per farmer are above both the national and Ningxia average.
24,604,4haof basic farmland have been constructed.These lay a great potential for the development of crop cultivation.
(2). Crop cultivation in the project area has a long history. The multiple crops such as potatoes, peas, broad beans, hyacinth  9
beans, buckwheat etc. are well merchandised and can serve as raw materials for processing industries. The sowing area is
98,797 ha with the grain production of 59,801 tons. Average production per ha is 6053 kg and average grain share per capita
is 150 kg and average grain share per capita of over 80.3% of farmers is less than 160 kg.
(3).The-project area is one ofthe main production bases of oil-bearing crops in Ningxia. The cultivation of oil-bearing crops
has already reached a remarkable scale.
(4).Vast grasslanid and rich resources can provide a big quantity of forage. Some local livestock are of good varieties. The
draught livestock can meet the need for fanning. Now there are bout 96,681 big animals and 253,830 sheep in the project
areas and average meat share per capita is 13 kg.
(5)-The area of forestry is about 32,645.28 ha in the project area, in xwlich the area of orchards is about 573.6 ha . The
output of dry and fresh fi-uits is 390.8 tons.
(6).The project area is rich in plant resources. There grow quite some medicinal herbs, nectariferous plants and fabric plants.
For example,, liquorice and ferns have become important products for export.
(7).The project area is poor in mineral resources. Except clay and pebble wvhich can be used as the raw  materials for
production and processing of brick ,tiler and lime products, other mineral resources have no exploitable value due to their
small reserves asis low quality.

3.4.2. Resources Evaluation
The natural resources, especially the rich resources of land, lay a solid foundation for the development of agriculture. In line
with the natural conditions. the economic activities are regionalized as follows:
Picture 3-2 Pasture
(1). Cold-humid highland area
In the cold-huunid highland zone, all the cultivated lands are scattered on the rocky-soily slopes. The steep slopes are thin in
soil layer, poor in water retaining and low in soil fertility. The share of cult;vated land per capita is only 3.3 mu. There is no
much potential for further more cultivated land. The climatic feature of this area is characterized by hligh elevation, low
temperature, much rainfall, less sunshine and short period of frost-free period. The insufficiency of heat is the maui
restrictive factor for the development of agriculture in this district. However, because of favorable rainfall, it is suitable to
cultivate winter wheat, spring wheat, naked oats, buckwheat, broad beans, maize, potatoes etc. and also to develop the
forest production. Since the surface water and under ground water are richl in resource, the area has the better conditions to
develop irrigation. As the vast grassland with abundant grass, the animuals, especially the cattle, could be raised and
developed in large scale. Also the resources of wild plants are very rich, there are more than 300 Chinese herbs and other
famous plants in the project areas; so the processing industries could be developed greatly. Since the construction of
Three west" agricultural developimnt in poverty alleviation,  in addition to the livestock raising ,a certain part of farmers
have get off the poverty and the economic development in those areas have been inproved greatly.
(2).Semi-arid area
Tn the semi-arid zone, the small amount of precipitation is concentrated in July, August and September, wvhich results mi
frequent floods and serious soil erosion. The precipitation varies greatly between years and between seasons. Tlherefore, the
precipitation availability to agricultural production is limiited. The small amount of susface run-off is mostly of blackish
water, undrinkable and ahnost no utilizable for irrigationi. The tunderground water is buried 20 --- 30 m deep (hi some places
100 im or deeper). Water shortage, diy hi Spring, drought in Summer, more rain in Autumn aiid cold and dry in Winter are
the main restrictive factors to the development of local econiomy. However, because of a bigger share of cultivated land per
capita, varied soil types, thick soil layer and rich sunshinie resources, it is a suitable place to cultivate wheat, maize, millets,
peas, potatoes, flax etc. In recent years, the area develops the construction of water cellars for solving the problem of the
drinLking water and also for micro-irrigation according the local actual conditions and at the same time, develops the wvater-
1 9



.
saving irrigation greatly. Such activities solve the main problems of inadequate water demand for crops in their growing
season. The model of making the investment in the construction and getting the obvious benefit at the same year and also
alleviating the poverty after three years' construction has been accepted by more and more farmers.

4. Analysis of Erivirousneiital Influence and the Counitermiieastures
*                 An separate evaluation was made focusing on the identification and selection of the influential factors in each of the project
component, so as to (I) determine the evaluation periods, scopes, direct influence and the generated indirect influence, as
well as their types, characteristics and degrees; (2) select evaluation factors; (3) recommend countermeasures and the
scheme of enviromnuent management, supervision and monitoring; and (4) further expound the feasibility of the project. The
said activities xvill support project for a sustainable status social progress, economic development and environment
rehabilitation.
4.1. Anialysis of the Project Influence on Natural Conuditions, SociaLlEcotonmic Development and Euiviromillent
System as well as the Countcrmeasures
4.1 1. Analysis of the Project influence on Natural Conditionsj Social/Economic Development and Environment System
The project influence on natural conditions, social/economic development and environment system is illustrated in table 4-
1.
(1) Influence on the natural conditions
Tn accordance with the identification and selection of the irnfluential factors, the influence of the construction of the project
awill be recognized in the following:
(a). Influence on the natural environment: Because of the earthwork in the improvement of the farmland, the construction
of rural roads and the construction of drinking water facilities in the implementation period, some negative influence on the
natural landscapc and the original topography will take place with rclativcly a low degre.
(b).In the operational period, the development of farmland improvement, forestry and animal husbandry will be beneficial
for the improvement of soil quality, air quality, surface water quality, and geology/topography, vwhile the activities in the
processing of rural product and the construction of drinking water facilities generate a slight negative influences, such as
land occupation and noise.
Therefore, the project construction has both advantages and disadvantages in terms of environment protection, especially in
the implementation period Generally speaking, the advantages are heavier than the disadvantages.
(2) Influence on ecological environment:
In accordance with the identification and selection of the influential factors, the project will make a temporary damage to
the vegetation coverage in the project implementation; but the influence on geology/topography, soil erosion and soil
fertility is slight. In the operation period, the project will generate overall positive influence on the ecological environment
except a slight contamination of drinking water and compacting farmland by livestock from some careless household.
Generally, the positive influences after the completion of the project will be on a significant improvement of the key
indicators of ecological quality, which will take the leading position.

(3) ifluences on social/economic development
Through the identification and selection of the influential factors, the positive influences of the project are very significant
both in the implementation period and the operation period. They can be expressed as (1) the increase in per capita income,
22
.



land utilization rate, grain production, output of agricultural products, (2) more employment, (3) much improvement in
rural production structure, (4) improvement of infrastructures, (5) better educational and teclmical status in the villages.
*             The ploject is aimiing at solving the problems of food shortage and  cloths deficiency in the poverty-stricken project area.
The poverty alleviation is of a great importance in the social progress. The local farmers can get some income through the
participation of the project. Iu particular, the project will help to improve the fundamental conditions for both production
and daily life. For example, processing of the local rural products wvill make a better tutilization of the local resources,
improve the production structure and generate more income sources. In this way, a solid foundation is laid for a sustainable
development. Tluough the construction of drinking water facilities, rural roads and other infiastructures, the envirosument of
daily life will be improved. Some of the surplus laborers will be provided with employment opportunities and the
population pressure to the local environmelnt will be alleviated. These are also in favor of the environment rehabilitation.
The construction of this project will alleviate the population pressure on the local sources, improve the ecological
environmnent, upgrade the environmenit quality, accelerate the cooperation and product exchange between the project area
and the outside. As a result, the progress of the local economy will accelerated.
4.1.2. Countenreasures

(7) Imp-rove the status of merchandization and infrastructure so as to coordinate the progress of both production and product
flow;
(8) Solve the problem betweetn the supply and demands of rural ener gy, and include this item into the development progrtam
of the project so as to prevent the farmers from negative influence to vegetation and forests due to firewood sholtage.
4.2. Analysis and Coisitertneasures of the Influence from  Agricultural Development Component on the
Envi onument
The investigation of the influence of agricultural development component on the environmnent is illustrated in table 4-
3.
*            In the project area, the crops with high yield, high economic return and high quality will be given priority of development.
Thle principles of the overall program are the coordination among crop cultivation, forestry and animal husbandry; the
coordinationi between production and processing; and the combination between quintessence of the traditional fannming and
23
.



the advanced technology of modem agriculture. On the basis of the construction of high & stable yielding farmland, much
attention wvill be focusing on vegetation protection and the control of soil erosion. Therefore, a harmonized development of
ecological rehabilitation, economic improvement anid social progress will be realized after the implementation of the
project.
However, there will probably be some negative influence on the environment. In this case, rational countermeasures
should be applied to solve the problem in favor of a sustainable system of agriculture and ecology.
4.2.1. Crop Cultivation Subproject
(1) Technical Scheme of Crop Cultivation Subproject
The crop cultivation subproject of 21,154 ha will be composed of two categories --- grain crops and economic crops. The
teclhical scheine for the main items are as follows:
a)   Plastic-mulch Com: The suitable farmland is the rain-fed land at valley flat and table plateau as well as the land
access to supplementary irrigation. The recomrnended hybrids are var. Zhongdan-2, Yedan-42, 1825, Jindan-2,
Jiudan-3, Pingdan-1. Wide rows (70 -- 90 cm) and narrow rows (40 cm) arranged altemnatively. 1 seedling 1 hill.
Plastic film mulching applied. At leaf spreading stage, film punctured. Attention to controlling com borer, armyworms
and aphids.    ~       2     ~

(2) Analysis of the xIfluence of Crop Cultivation Subproject on Environment and Countermeasures
(a ) Cultivation with plastic mulching
* Positive Influence: As a new and advanced technology, the advantages of plastic mulching can be summarized as
28 



follows: (1) increase soil temperature -- uider mulchinlg the soil temperature in the 0 -- 20 cm top-soil is iicreased in
favor of early maturing; (2) the utilization rate of the soil moisture is increased by over 80 %. For example, the
protected soil moisture in mulched maize can be converted as an addition of 300 mm rainfall in the whole growing
period; (3) mulching can accelerate the decomposing of the organic matters in the soil in favor of a higher contents of
fast-available niutrients in the soil. hn the same process, the physical/chemical features of the soil is improved; and
(4) mulching can hold back the growth of weeds. In the project area, the yield of mulched maize averages around 6000
-- 7500 kg/ha, while that at the open field being 3000 -- 4500 kg/ha.
.D Negative Influence:  (1) If the mulching period is longer than enough, the residues can give negative influence to the
development of the crop root system reducing the yield. (2) Mulching can hold the rainwater from penetration and
cause water erosion and soil loss.
*            ® Countenneasures:  (1) Fanners can exchange the waste plastic film for the new at a favorable price. The waste
plastic will be unwieldy collected back and treated. On-the-spot burning is forbidden. (2) The application of
degradation plastic film is encouraged. In accordance with the research reports from Sichuan Province, small pieces of
plastic film (less than 6 x 6 cm) had basically no negative effect on crop yield and the bulk weight of the soils, when
the contents of the plastic film in the soil was at 1/1000. (3) For the sake of soil conservation, the ridges in/around the
farmland should been constructed at parallel of contour in order to prevent soil erosion.
(b) Application of Chemical Fertilizers
30   Positive Influence:  Rational application of chemical fertilizers is one of the effective measures in favor of crop
growth.
3k Negative Influence:  Too much or mono- application of chemical fertilizers can pollute soil environment. Normally,
the main componenits of nitrogenous and phosphorous fertilizers are of nitrates and phosphates, respectively. Too
*                much application of chemical fertilizers is hamiful for the crops. For example, the application of calcium phosphate or
iron-aluminum phosphate over 1125 kg/ha will result in Fe-deficiency, Zn-defficiency and P loss as well as yield
reduction.
a Countermeasures:  (1) Take the application of organic manure as the main, and the rational application of chemical
fertilizers/trace element fertilizers as the supplementary. (3) Supervise fertilizer application and introduce applied
technology.
(c) Application of Pesticides:
*3 Negative influence:  The application of pesticides will possibly pollute soils and crops. In the controlling of plant
diseases, pests and weeds, about 40 to 60 % of the pesticides is mixed in the soils, including some vcry poisonous
components such as organic nitrogen, organic phosphate, arsenide and mercury compounds. Despite of natural
degradation, there is still some residues remaining in the crops.
*3> Countermeasures:  Pesticides with high eficient aid low poisonous residues will be applied. Research and extension
of the effective methods for pest control will be conducted.
*           (d) Fanrland Leveling
o Negative Influence: In the process of fannland leveling, the fertile surface soil is moved away. As a result, soil fertility
29
.



is lowered and the land will be susceptive to deseitification. In addition, the problem of soil erosion is worsened.
.; Countermeasures:  Application of organic manure, growing green manure, itnprove soil structure, promote soil
fertility, control desertificatiorn and soil erosion-
(e). Influence of Irrigation
0, Negative Influence:  In a long process of irrigation, it is possible to cause soil salinity in some area, while lowering
the underground water table in other areas.
p> Countermeasures:  To level land suiface; To strengthen soil supervision; To construct necessary drainage system; To
strengthen the protection of underground water resources.
(f) Crop Monoculture
.  Negative nifluence:  Deficiency of somUe of the soil elements; lowering the physical/chemical features of the soil;
mnore plant diseases, pests and weeds.
Countermeasues:  To establish a system of crop rotation- In areas in short of manure/feitilizers, a simple rotation of
field-to-field is recommnended.
4.2.2. Forestry Subproject
(I) Tecnlical Scheme of Forestry Subproject
fg Fruit trees:   The species to be planted will be ah-lond apricots, apples and Chinese red dates. 'ille trees will be
planted on leeward sutny gentle slopes, around villages and access to water and transportation. Soils will be prepared
with overall pattern or partial pattern. It will be better to prepare the soils in the 1st year anLd plant tree in the niext year.
The seedlings will be of grafted 1st grade. Replant will be conducted to replace the dead trees to reach the keeping rate
of 100 %. Attention to pest control and protection of young trees for over-wintering.

Soil conservation forests and conifer timber forests:  The afforestation will be conducted in the cold-hutmid areas in
Jingyuan County. The main species to be selected for conifer timber forests will be Pious tabaleafomTnis. P. armandi, P.
sylvestris. The shrubs for soil conservation forests are Caragana spp., Prunus davidiana, sea buckthom, Tamarix
chinensis, and these species will be planted at the margin of the valleys. Wild apricots, Robinia spp., Ailanthus
altemata will be planted at valley slopes. Poplars, willows and some spicy plants will be arranged at the bottom of the
valleys. Trees and shrubs will also be planted along farmland ridges. The planting site will be prepared into "V'
narrow furrows or "U" wide furrows in accordance with the actuial situation.
* S

(2). Analysis of the hnfluence of Forestry Project on Environment
3    Positive nfluencc:   A part from the remarkable economic benefit, the forcstry project will play an important role in
environment rehabilitation. Forest network can filter dust, absorb poisonous matters and carbon dioxide, disinfect air
*                      germs, reduce noise, produce oxygen, justify air temperature and humidity, protect crops from wind damage, conserve
water and soil, protect wild animals. For example, one hectare of forest can reduce soil loss by 60 tons annually.
r Negative Iflssence:  Pesticides are applied in pest control to cassse some pollution to air and soil.
D Countermeasures:  Pesticides with high efficient and low poisonous residues will be applied. Pesticides with acute
poison and high residues should be forbidden. At same time, research and extension of the effective methods for pest control
will be conducted.
*                 4.2.3. Livestock Subproject
(1) Technical Scheme of Livestock Subproject
3 Cattle raising:   The local cows will be improved through frozen semen from improved varieties such as var.
"sinmentar' or Short-homed so as to provide merchandised cattle and manure in favor of agriculture..
03 Sheep/goats raising:   Local ewes will be improved with var. "Chinese Mirono" or other mutton/wool-purposed fine
wool varieties. Local goats will be improved with improved varieties introduced from Lianoning Province for higher
production of cashmere.
.3 Pig raising:   Local pigs will be improved through introducing improved varieties such as var. "durok" and
31
01



"neijiang". After a raising period of 8 -- 10 months, the pig can be merclandised.
3 Grass Growing Project:  For the development of livestock, artificial growing of grass will be condLucted, in addition
to the protection and the utilization of the natural grassland. It is planned that the growing acreage will amount to
0.033 ha. The recommended species is alfafa.
(2). Anialysis of the Influence of Livestock Subproject on Environment
.    Positive Influence:  Larger acreage of giass,growing in favor of ecological rehabilitation; Better titilization of crop
residues for forage; Providing niore manure in favor of crop cultivation.
o2 Negative Influence:  Damage to vegetation due to over grazing; Worsening the problems of fuel shortage and forage
deficiency in the project area , so that there is a destructive utilization of the grassland resoturces and the situation of
water erosion and soil loss is worsened; Causing sanitation and environnient pollution due to a careless management
of the manure.
.C  Countermeasures:  Rationally regulating the scale of livestock development in line with the stocking capacity of the
grassland; Justifying grazing time and districts; Increasing the acreage of grassland and firewood forests; And
promoting grass production.
4.2.4. Soil Improvement Subproject

a. Analysis of the Influeince of terraced Farnland Construction on Environment
.C   Positive Influence:  To improve the capacity of retaining water, fertility and soil for a more stable and higher yield.
In accordance with the calculation from Ningxia Bureau of Soil Conservation, the Construction of ternaced farmland
can reduice soil loss by 0.4991 million tons/year and increase water retaining capacity by 1.87 million cubic meters
annually.
.3 Negative Influence: Earthwork can damage vegetation coverage. The newly filled section is loose in soil texture, low
in fertility and susceptive to soil erosion.
*3 Countermeasures:  (1) Apply of organic manure after the construction of terraced fannland and cultivate the land at
the earliest possible time. According to the stuvey reports in the project area, planting shrubs (such as Caragana spp)
on the ridge of the terraced farmland is very effective to control soil erosion. Caragana spp. are vesy adaptable shrubs
and can be high quality forage. The annual production of the eatable section (3 year old Caragana spp) can amount to
1599 kg/ha. (2) Some channels for rainwater drainage are constructed and lined-up at the necessary sections to
prevent farmland damage fi om heavy rains.
b.. Analysis of the Influence of the Improvement of Mid/Low-yielding Farmland on Environment
*0   Land leveling is possible to cause problems of water erosion and soil loss. The application of organic manure and the
cultivation of green manure can increase the soil fertility and improve the soil texture. The recently leveled land
should be cultivated at possible earliest tinie.
The application of chemicals with high efficient, low poisonous residues is recosnunended for pest control and weeding.
Biological control of the pests should be extended. Monoculture and too much application of chemical fertilizers
should be discarded. Fertilizer application should be conducted on the basis of soil analysis. Analysis and
countermeasures of influence of agricultural development component on enviromnent is given in table 4-4.

(4). Subproject Construction Conditions
A. Location of factories
Based on the resources distribution, exploitable potentiality and cuwrent conditions in the project cotuities, the factories
should be located in the suburbs of county town or townships with access to transportation, electricity ans water supply.
They will be better to make use of the exisiting facilities ,idle sites and places where raw materials and products can be
purchased ,transported and sold conveniently.
B.Construction conditions
a.Electric power
Ningxia is one of the northwest provinces of China whlich have superiority in electric power resources. At present,
35



electricity is available for evesy village. llhe total electricity supply capacity is 9.73 blllion kwvh, electricity consumption is
8.333 billion kwh and exported electricity is 1.397 kwh annually. The electricity supply for the project area are be from
inside Ningxia asid the electricity supply is sufficient for the project.
b.Fuel
The main fuel to be used for the processing industry of the project is coal. Coal consumption totals 3048 tons annually and
*             8.47 tons daily. Coal reserves in Ningxia is very rich and occupies the fourth place in China. The yearly output is 10 million
tons. There are four coal mines in the project counties with total annual output of 12,000 tons . In addition, there are some
other coal mines near the project area such as AnkIou, Huating, Jmiyuan etc. In Gansu province. Coal supply for the project
is sufficient.
C.Water supply
In this project, water is snainly provided to fine starch processing factory, flax processing factory and sheep fur flasinelette
processing factoiy. A good amount of high quality water is needed in processing of fuse starch, but Xiji Fine Starch
*             Processing Factory has its ready-made water supply and treatment facilities, together with running water supply in the
project county, water for the production can be completely supplied. Although small amount of water is used for sheep fur
flannelette processing factory, there is a rich reserves in underground water within the factory. The average depth is 10-15m.
Water quality is good and the factory has a pumping well. However, a water tower will be built to satisfy 300-400cu.m.of
daily water consumption for production. Due to small amount of water required for flax processing, on the basis of previous
*             water supply facilities, another newly-built water tower can satisty the neen of water supply.
4.3.2. Analyzis of lnfluaccc of Rural Enterprises Development Component on Environmcnt
TIntvestigation of influence of rural enterprises development component on environment is given in table 4-5.
ALialysis of major influence of rural enterprises development component on envirounment is given in table 4-6.
(1). Xiji Fine Starch Processing Factory
Emission of Pollutant and the Analysis of Treatment Measures are as follows:
(A) Emission of Waste Water:  The main pollutant in the processing is the waste water (700 tons/day). The waste water
mainly comes from: (1) water conveying step and tuber wvashing step, (2) separating and concenitrating steps, (3)
hydroextractinig and drying steps. The waste water contains mud and protein.
As requested in the design for pollutant emission, the waste water with high concentration of organic matters is drabied into
the deposition pools. After depositing and soak dissipation, the waste water is drained into earth pool beside the plant for
natural oxidation. Tiesi the treated waste water will be drained into the Hulu River. The other waste water with a slight
concentration of organic matters will be drained out directly from the plant. Therefore, thc production will not make much
influence on the surface water.
Generally speakinig, the treatment measures in the design is feasible and the productiojn will not make snuch influence on
the envirounment. However, the following items should be considered:
(a) The inability of extracting protein in the waste water is wasting resources and also causing some pollution to the
environment,
(b) When the water quantity of the target river is limiited, the organic miaters will deposit on the river bed. As a result, a
large proportion of the ddissolving oxygen in the river water is depleted, the decayed river water will release some polluting
37



gas such as hydrothion and mercaptan.

concentration in the national regulation (400 mg per cubic meter).
C) Waste Residues
The waste residues are coal residue from the boiler and the tuber residue of potato. 'The coal residue will amount to 600
tons/year. Although it is a raw material for cement, it cannot be utilized due to the actual conditions. Since the area of the
plant is limited, a permanent ground for the residue has not yet been considered. In the recent years, it can be used as filling
materials for leveling the plant ground. A integrated utilization of the coal reside will- been considered in the future. The
potato residue will amount to 6,000 tons annually. It can be directly sold out as forage and manure.

flax retting step in production. The waste water is mainly fiom flax retting tank. The daily water consumption is 84cu.m.
And daily effluen ts amount to 49cu.m. The waste water contains organic matters. Based on the data from similar plants,
water quality of discharged waste water is given in table 4-7
Concentration of Major Pollutions
Table 4-7

We can see friom the data provided by the similar plants that although disclharge amount of waste water from flax rett:ing is
not so much, it still produced some pollution to environment because of large amount of organic matters contained in it. It
results in waste of resources. The waste.water is warm, so it should be treated and comprehensively used with the viewv of
aiming at clean production and environmental protection.
According to our field investigation on the subproject and reconmendation from the World Bank officials, it is suggested
that waste water fiom flax rettinig should be treated adopting land purificationi system.  hlie waste water is purified and
absorbed by soil and then residual overflow is discharged illto dry sand ditches or retumned to flax retting system for reuse.
A.Purification Prbcess
The waste water with ceitain tempcrature and rich content of organic matters discharged fromn flax retting workshop is sent
through a holy pipe wlich is buried beneath the ground of  a stunshine warmhouse. Waste water is infiltrated soil through
the pipe. Because tunder the soil, good-quality water -proof materials such as plastic mulch to prevent water from seepage.
After being filtered through land treatment, organic matters in waste water are absorbed and disintegrated by soil and
microbes in the soil in favor of purification of water quality. However, the temperature is veiy low in this area in winter,the
waste water from flax retting will increase temperature oftthe soil and is helpful for crops growth.
Lanid purification treatment system for waste water from flax retting is given in chart 5-4

B.Main advantages of Land Purification treatment System
Accordinig to the introduction of related experts and available information, there is successful experience in the operation of
the land purification treatment system in foreign countries. Its main advantages are as follows:
a)The investment and operation cost needed for the systemn are low. The operation of the system is stable and effect of
purification is good.
b)Soil can fully absorb the organic matters in the waste water and it is in favour of crops growth and redue pollution to
enviromunent.
c)In winter,surplus heat of waste water from flax retting can be used completely to keep warm in warmbhouse all year round.
It not only makes full use of resources but also promote economic benefit of enterprises.
d)The system fully shows the principle of clean production teclhnology. The lost resources such as organic matters ,surplus
heat and water resource are not only made full use of but also pollution to the envirorunent is reduced.
in addition, the main pollutant from flax production workshopis dust- In accordance with the design, the dusty air will be
filtered before being expelled. The ssnoke from the small boiler will be desulphated before being expelled. After the above-
mentioned treatment, the pollution degree is within the national regulations.
(3) Xiji Sheep Fur Flasmelettf Processing Factory
The dyeing and ironinlg for sheep fur are mainly to adopt chemical tanning for sheep fr.The whole production procedure
cani be divided in dsy step atnd wet step. The major waste water from produLction has the characteristics of large discharge
amounit, high alkalinity, deep chrominance, high oxygetn consuinption and rich suspensioni matters. It can be divided into
four types according tolits characteristics.
a)Harmful waste water: It accounts for about 15-20% of total waste water and mainly clhromisun-cositainring waste water
from tanniing. This kind of waste water produced serious pollutioss to environument and is mainly treated.                    0
b)Waste water containing useful matters: It accounts for 10-15% of the total waste water. The composition in it is 0.2-0.4%
nitrogen,0.01-0.03% phosphate which are good organic fertilizer.
c)Washing waste water: The waste water from  washing at various steps accounts for 55-65%  of total waste water. It
contains ssnall amount of organic matters such as fat, fatty oil and fur residue and salt. This kin-d of water produces slight
pollution,but is rich in suspensioni matters and should be treated with deposit.
d)Dyeing wastewater: It accounts for 10% of the total waste water. It needs treatment before being disclarged, otherwise, it
will mnake the surface water in abnormal colors-.
Of which, the chrome waste water from  sheep fur flanuelette production is the maini pollution source. According to the
practical production process, retting step is made in chrome tanning tank. The cLrome tannuing solution is made in one timne
and 5 tons of solution is put in each tank,among Niuich ,200mg/litre of Cr3' 3000mg/litre of Cl- ,PH value is 4"4.5. This
part of chronse solution is only discharged for twice a year. According to the discharge method for waste water, the complex
comnpositioss of waste water, intermnittent discharge and large variation, the chromne wastewater will be treated by adopting
alkaline method. Because Cr? in waste water from retanning tends to transfonn into CY(OH)3 deposit, the quantity of
Cr(OH)3  and its

complete sovation are related to PH value in water and water temperature when PH value in solubility equals 8-9(Ksp
equals 6.3 *10-3). When PH value equals 7-9.8, the most deposit of Cr(OH)3 is formed. When the water temperature is at
18 to 20 , the speed of deposit is maximum and the effect is best. So the following treatment scheme for waste chrome liquid
*               will be adopted.

The raw materials are mainly wool thread and wool yarn. 'Ihe production is of pure hand weaving. There is almost no
pollution to the environment. However, Since most of the employees are women workers. At the consideration of the
physiological features of the women workers, heavy things (such as raw materials and packed products) will be carried by
*               men workers. Working conditions will be improved in favor of the women workers.

social progress and economic development.
cl)  The conistruction of the micro-irrigation facilities will improve the ecological environunent of rain-fed fanning for a
higiher grain yield.
e)  In the implementation period of the project, the temporary damage to vegetationj is possible to result in water erosion
and soil loss.
f)  In the implementation period, the drinkinLg water is possible not upto the sanitatioln standards due to the lower level of
management.
(2) Counterneasures
Trhe following countermeasures will be taken to overcome the disadvantage of the project.
a)  If it is possible, the engineering activities should avoid raining seasons under the consideration of water erosion and
soil loss.
.
b)  In the implementation of the project, the management of drinkinig water and the supervision of the water quality
should be strengthened.
c)   The constructioni sites should be timely mended thlrough artificial planting of trees and grasses to prevent water
erosion and soil loss.

(1) The opinions of specialists and scholars
The project is a comprehensive agricultural development one with its major objectives to alleviate poverty of the farners in
the mountainous areas. The inplementation of the project would not only improve its natural ecological environment, raise
liying standards of people and alleviate poverty; but also have the resources of the project areas exploited rationally,
*         -       promote the coordinating development of fanning, forestry, animal husbandry and sideline industry; make a great progress
in education, medical care, science and technoloey, services; transform the povelty and backward conditions and benefirts
both the country and people, so it should be put into operation as soon as possible.
(2) Opinions of local administrative officials
The implementation of the project would promote the production development in the project areas, increase income of
farner households, improve living standards and basically solve thc poverty problems. Meanwhile, in the project
implementation, mountains, rivers, fields, forests and roads would be put in order. The ecological environment would
become better gradually. The vicious circle of poverty and environment would be escaped. After the completion of the
project, medical care and education levels would be upgraded considerably in the project sites. The improvement of
drinking water facility for fanners and ainimals and traffic facilities can promote the overall development of economy,
enhance quality of population in the project sites. We are glad to make constributions to the project construction.

6. The Analysis of the Profit and Loss of Envir onlmental Economlly
6.1 The Pr-inciples of the Analysis
Qiniba Project is the comprehensive deve]opmenit one of apgiculture and also the one of the environmnental system. The
development of the project not only improve the natural biological conditions but also prevenit the water and soil fioim
losing and prevent the farmland from becominig sandy one. It woould lay a solid fotndation for the sustainable developmemit
of ag-iculture. So the analysis shoutld be follow the following principles according to the produce characteristics:
(1). Take the natural environminent as a kind of resource, adopt the methods of system engineer ing to appraise the tlutl value
of the enviromnental economy of the project and also to evaluate the actual cost
(2). The investment made in the project environmental protect is for obtaining the greater benefit, not for covering the
unfavourable influence of the environment created by the pr oject development

6.4.2 According to the feasibility report, the financial internal rate of retum in the whole project area is 23.80 % and the
financial intemal rate of return ofthe productive items is 29.44 %. The saidfinancial internal rate of retum areboth higher
than the basic rate of return (12 %). In the project period of 20 years, the accumulative net income would be positive in the
8th year. The net income in the 20 years would be 1652.90964 million yuan. By the 10th year, the accumulative net present  0
value would be positive and the total net present value of the project would be 262.98582 million yuan.
The analysis of the uncertainties shown that the intemal rate of return are both higher than the discount rate(12%). These
indicate that this project is financially resistant to risks.
6.4.3 In accordance with the parameter of the shadow price and the port price of some goods stipulated in the Economic
Evaluation Methods and Index of Project Construction issued by the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of
Construction, the price adjustment of the main substantial input and output has been adjusted and then the economric price
could be calculated.
After the completion of the project, an additional 12664.8 ha of basic farmland would be constructed, including 4062.8 ha
irrigated with water-saving techniques, 146 ha irrigated by wells, 7916 ha of terraced farmland, 540 ha of new land from
small rivers control, 9770 ha of low and middle yielding land improved and 716 ha of fruit trees.
The project would help to feed an additional 2088812 livestock and to plant an additional 2782 ha. of perennial forage grass.
The project would help promote the productivity of the farmland and enhance the load-bearing capacity of the land in the
project area.
According to the feasible analysis, in the production period, 4.99815 million yuan will be annually submitted to the State in
terms of tax. The 44,814 ruxal households will have an annual average net income of 268143 yuan.

6.4.4 The Biological benefit of Environment
The project is the comprehensive agricultural developmeent one. According to the local conditions, the implementation of
the project would be carried out in line with the overall plan and diversified economy . The development of the crops
cultivation and the livestock raising could inprove the processing industrie.s of agricultural products and sideline products.
The resources of sunshine and heat could be used fully and the efficiency of the land use could be enhanced greatly. The
biological economy could be tum to the better circulation.
*                   (1). The construction of ten-aced fannland and water cellar for micro-irrigation would not only improve the basic conditionls
for agricultural development, but also effectively control the soil-water erosion by intercepting and collectimg surface
runoff.
(2). LI the implementation of the project, scientific fanning will be encouraged. Extension service will help to minimize any
l                   possibilities to the adverse impact to the enviroiunenit due to an increased application of chemnical fertilizers and pesticides.
The availability of new plastic fihn would be on the basis of returninig the old one to prevent its injury to soils.
(3). In the construction activities, much attention would be paid to the protection of the existing vegetation. As the project
areas are all in the remote poverty-striken villages and the imnplemientation of the project could be carried out in the
decentralized way, the environunenit could not be polluted.
(4). In the selection of the items of the rural industrial development, a serious consideration was made to construct only
those without or with very little pollution to the environmenit.
.
(5). Tlhe development of livestock industries will provide agricultujre with a big quantity of bamyard manure in favor of soil
fertility, on the other hand, avoid the pollution and enhance the organic contents of the soil.
6.4.5 Social benefit
(1). The project area is a region of Muslin compact community, whlere concentrate the high percentage of the povesty
haunted people, and it is the most difficult area in the poveity alleviation action. So the inplementation of the project serves
not only to solve the food shortage problems for the area, promnote the comprehensive economic and social development of
the mninority, but also to open a way, quite unusual from the traditional ones, for poverty alleviation, and search for a new
type of relief mode so as to provide a model for other minorities troubled with poverty.
(2). By the 6th year of the projcct, the income per capita would increase from 267 yuan (by the constant price in 1990)  Di
1995 to 550 yuan, and the farmland share per capita would increase over 2 mu. Both the targets of economic improvement
0                   and resources exploitation would be reached. The application of fanming techniques would be encouraged. The social
benefits and result of poverty alleviation would be significant.
(3) The implemlenitation of the project would lay a fotuldation for continuous development of social economy in the
project areas. The productive progress of the project would encourage tde farmers to be more active in farming. The
imiplemiienitationi of the project would generate lots of employment opportunities to the surplus labor forces and especially to
women. The training scheme vwould amount to 451410 person-time, including 45000 person-timne of farmers in applied
teclhiques and 1410 person-time of management staff and teclusicians at Regional-, coumty- and township-leveled
organizations short-term or long-tenn both abroad and at home.
.
(4). hle project wvould lhelp solve the problemn of drinikinig water shortage for 9128 people, 2277 big livestock  and 2387
sheep/goats.

6.5 Tbe Investmenit of the Environimental Protection
According to the investment aiticles of the environimental protection stipulated in the Design Regulationis of the
Environmenet Protection issued by State CoLuncil and the Envu-onmental Protection Burcau, the estimate would follow the
followving investment estimate of environmental protectioni.
(1). The forests plantitg. the grass pgowinig, the development of the rural enterprises, the environmental contirol and the
drinking water works etc. would be inchlded in the investment of environrental protection.
(2). 'The cost of old plastic mulch recover'v and disposing of should be included in the investment of the environmllental
protection.
(3). The monitoring of enivirorunenit and the maintenance cost of the environDment should be incluided in the investmlent of
the environmental protection.
According to what said above, the investment made in the environmental protection would be 4%--6°o. of the total
investment of the project . This proportion is lower than the standard of 10% of the project sensility analysis and could not
eflect thle implementation of the project.
6.6. Concilusioni
(1). After the implementation of the project, the net revenues from the products produced by the project would reach
146.7609 niillion Yuan and the financiaL intemal rate of return in the wvhole project area is 23.80 % and the financial
internial rate of return of the productive items is 29.44 %. The said financial intemal rate of return are both highet than the
basic rate of return (12 %).
(2). Analysis of UJnceitainties slhowved that the said intenmal rate of returpn are both higher than the basic discount(12%).
These indicate that this project is financially resistant to risks.
(3). The project could make great contributions to the coLutry and about 4.99815 million yuan will be annually submitted
to the State in terms of tax. The 44,814 rural households will have an annual average net income of 2681.43 yuan.
So the project could combine the social, economic and environmental benefits efficieently through the effective execution of
all sub-projects and make the project develop coordinately and provide the guarantee for the sustained development of the
project operation.

7. Analysis of Environmental Risks
As a comprehensive project for both poverty alleviation and sustainable development, this Qinba project for poverty
alleviation is covering multiple disciplinaries, tradeslindustries and districts. The project is composed of crop cultivation,
animal husbandry, rural enterprise development and other productive components. The construction of the project is subject
to both the influences of socialleconomic conditions and natural features. Since the construction period is long, there are
many uncertainties. Therefore, much attention should be paid to economic development, social progress and environment
*            rehabilitation in the implementation of the project.
7.1. Environmental Risks
T he environmental risks are mainly related with agricultural development project, which is more susceptible to climatic
conditions. Located in the mountainous areas of southem Ningxia, the project area lies in the transition between arid and
semi-arid areas. The natural conditions are poor and the ecological environment is harsh. Natural calamities happen
frequently. In particular, the rain-fed farming area suffers from frequent drought, flooding, low temperature and hails. In
recent years, the project area suffered from a biggest drought in 100 years: The development of crop cultivation, animal
*            husbandry and fruit trees has been seriously slowed dowA.
In order to reduce the environmental risks, the principle of suitable species at suitable places was followed in the selection
of the crops. The selected crops are adapted to the local conditions in the long time of traditional farming and there is a
ready experience in the cultivation, the crops such as flax, potato, beans, Chinese onion, apples, Chinese red dates and
*            almond apricots. Necessary technology will be applied in the cultivation of maize and rapeseed, since they are susceptive to
climatic conditions. Therefore, the production loss from climatic calamities can be reduced.
7.1.1. Climatic Influence on Crop Cultivation
The worst climatic influence on crop cultivation in the project area is drought, which can reduce the yield and sometimes
can even destroy the crops completely. Wind-blowing can be listed as the 2nd worst, which causes crop lodging. Therefore,
the selected varieties should be characterized by drought tolerance and lodging resistance. The application of mulching
technology will not only solve the problem of heat deficiency in the cold-humid highland zone, but also the problem of
*            water shortage in the and and semi-arid areas.
7.1.2. Climatic Influence on Fruit Trees
Drought, sand-blowing and late frost are very injurious to fruit trees. Therefore, varieties with drought resistance and cold
tolerance should be selected. Micro-irrigation facilities (e.g. water cellars) will help solve the problem of water shortage.
7.1.3. Climatic Influence on Animal Husbandry
Drought and coldness are 2 of the importance restrictive factors to the development of animal husbandry. In particular,
when there is a big drought, the production of grassland is sharply reduced and cause problem of forage deficiency.
Livestock are susceptive to suffer from cold winter.
7.1.4. Influence of Pests
*            Ihe development of crop cultivation, fruit trees and animal husbandry can all be restricted more or less by pests and
diseases. Therefore, in the growing period of crops and fruit trees, pests and disease should be closely monitoring and
59



forecasting. In animal husbandry, much work should be done in vaccination and epidemic prevention as well as sanitation
of animal houses.
7.1.5. Climatic Influence on Soils
The influences on soils are land desertification, water erosion and soil loss, Wvhich are reducing the accumulation of organic
matters in soils. In particular, the construction activities should avoid raining seasons. In addition, much effort should be
made in afforestation.
7.1.6. In the implementation period, it is required that the reclaimed land should be timely utilized to prevent land
desertification.
7.2. Countermeasures
Under the actual natural conditions, the capacity against environmental risks mainly depends on the countermeasures
against drought and coldness. The selection of the project activities is focusing on overcoming the restrictive factors in the
project area. Foe example, the construction of terraced farmland and the application of mulching technology are to
overcome the negative influence of drought and coldness by means of the improvement of water retaining capacity of the
soils. Micro-irrigation with water cellar is to make a better utilization of the rainfall resources in dry farming. All these will
effectively help build up the project capacity against environmental risks.

8. Substitutte Schemle
This project is aiming at poverty alleviation through steady measures to solve the problems of food sholtage and cloths
insutficiency and to create steady income sources for the farmers in the project covering area. With the help of the project
investmeint, the overall objective will be reached by (1) through increasing soil improvement, technical extension and the
increase of the acreage of higli yielding crops to increase grain production; and (2) through increasing the acreage of
econoinic fruit trees and the development of livestock to generate steady sources of income for the farmers. As a result, the
overaU social and economic progress in the project counties will be accelerated. Thcrefore. it is difficult to fine a veiy
optimiun overall scheme to reduce the negative environmenital influence in the determination of project site, construction
scale and the exact activities. However, under the analysis of the design of the project components, the following substitute
scheme can be found out:
(1) Agricultural Developiiment Project
Upon a careful review, it was fowsd out that the intetnsity of the utilization of the forage resources iu the livestock project in
Xiji County was too strong, and there would be a contradiction between the supply and demands of the rural energy. It is
*                   recoiiunenided that the production scale should be timely justified in the annual imnplementation plan, while a strengthened
effort is made in the construction of artificial grassland.
There is no doubt that the application of mulchinmg technology in inaize cultivation is very necessary. However, in a big-
scaled cultivation of tnulched maize, the following consideration should be made: (1) whether the improved air temperature
and soil temperature can reach the necessary elongation of the frost-free period? (2) If the soil moisture cannot be recharge
by rainl, whdether the soil moisture can meet the water requirement of the crops? (3) In a big-scaled application of mulching
tecr1onkigy, much attention should be made to prevent the "'white pollution of the plastic filn.
(2) Rural Enterprises Development
-    Upon a careful review, it was fotuid out that the proposed production capacity of the fine starch powder plant in Xiji
Cotimty would amosuit to 5,000 tons/year, which would not reach the economic justified poinit. It is recommended that
the production capacity should be increased upto 12,000 tons/year. In this way, more farmers will be benefited by the
project.
O It is a waste of the resoiurces for the fine starchI powder plant to drain directly the waste water that contains much
protein. From the point of view ctean production, it is recommeended that the protein in the waste water can be
extracted by air-float technology. In this way, the resource is saved and the pollution is reduced.
 The construction of the sheep wool flannelette plant in Xiji County is a project compotlent with less inlvestment and
quick economic return. It is recommended that this component should be included in the implementation plan of the
project.
 Tne construction and extension of some carpet making plant will generate more employment opportunities for womeln.
Therefore, it is recommended.
e In the lineni processing plant in Xiji County, the wastc watcr ffoiom retting step contains miudcs organic matters amid it is
warm, It is recommcnded that the water can be purified by fartnland treatment system, it is also recommended that
some gr-cenhouse can be constructed near the plant to utilize the water temperattu-e.
61



a    Upon a carefuil review, it is found out that theie were some mniustified items in the procedu-e designs of both the fine
starch powder plant and linen processing plant in Xiji County. It is recommended that a furtherl checking -,ill be
needed before the implementation of the pr oject firom the point of view of clean produiction.
0 It is recomlmended that the construction of degradationi plastic film plant will be added into the riural enterprise
developmnenit project.
(3) IufrastrctuLre Constiiction
The construction of micro-irrigation wells is one of the important measures to solve the problem of drinking water shortage.
In some of the water-deficient areas, the monitoring ofthe dynamic status of the underground water should be strengthened.

9. Environment Policies and Monitoring
9.1. Environment Management
9.1.1. Regional Management of Environment
All levels of the local govenmnent is responsible for the quality of the regional environment at the corresponding
*            administrative district. Ningxia Environment Bureau is responsible for a unified supervision and management of the
environment in Ningxia territory. The key issues to be dealt with are:
*   To establish a system of responsibility in the regional protection of the environment for a sustainable development in
the project area:-
* To prepare a comprehensive program against desertification and to strengthen the construction of protection forests:
* To coordinate the environment management organizations in the project area, to promote the progress of environment
rehabilitation and protection and to improve the utilization and protection of the biological resources such as liquorice
and Chinese ephedra;
* At the coordination with the environment management organizations in the project area to prepare management*
regulations on the utilization of the mineral resources.
9.1.2. Enviromnent Management in the Project Area
Under the principle that those who exploit the resources are those who are responsible to protect the resources, the
environment in the project area will be managed through the cooperation between Ningxia Environment Bureau and the
environment management organizations in the project area. The key issues to be dealt with are:
*   Carry out the enviroument management policies issued by the Chinese Central Government and Ningxia Government
*              * To establish a responsibility system of environment protection in the utilization of the land resources. The activities of
abandoning farmland and over-grazing are forbidden;
* To establish a responsibility system of rural energy supply and prepare practical plan of coal distribution and an

10. Conclusioni and Recoinimetndatiota
10.1. Feasibility Analysis of the Project Constrtiction
*   Because of the actual natural conditions and the economic features in the project area, the local environunent is in a
status of vicious cycle for a long time. Aiming at poverty alleviation, China Qinba Mountains Poverty Reduction
World Banik Loan Project is to help solve the problems of food shortage anid cloths deficiency and generate income
sources for the fanners in the project covering areas.
* Through ans intensive development in multiple trades/industries, this project is to help the project area alleviate
poverty or get rid of absolute poverty.
a Tluhough the inprovement of the production conditions, the leading industries are selected for a higher production and
better economic return. Through the development of crop cultivation and rural enterprises, not only the problems of
food shortage and cloths deficieiicy will the solved, and the overall living standards of the local fanners will be
upgraded. As a result, a sustainable capacity of development will be built up for the economic development and social
progress of the proiect counties.
Generally speaking, the construction of the project is feasible.
10.2 Coinclusion
.
(t) This project of poverty alleviation will help to rehabilitate the natural environment and to push the ecological
construction iisto a benigi  cycle. In the implemtentation of the project, the influence of the project development on the
environmenit can be alleviated througlh practical countermeasures. The project will be in favor of the improvement of the
environ-mental quality and the establishment of a sustailable development.
.
(2) The overall arrangement of the project fully reflects the inlterrelation of the project components, which will be of a
guiding importance for a comprehensive and justified development of the project.
(3) Tihe project will encourage an affective utilization of the local resources. In the improvement of the productivity of the
land resources, a careful consideration is made on controlling water erosion and soil loss.
(4) Tnhe technical schleme of the project is justified. The selected components will result in little pollution. 'lierefore, it is
feasible.
.
(5) The cvaluation of the project influence on the environment showed that the construction of the project will push the
environmenit rlehabilitation and economic developmenit into a benign circle. Therefore, the implementation scheme of
Ningxia Project is feasible frosn the point of view of envi-omnent.
*                   10.3. Recoiniiemidatiunis
(1) The agricultural developmenit project should draw on the local experience of a successful regulation of small water
catclmients and should be coordinated with soil conservationi. Mucl effost should be made on the inprovement of the
productivity of the land resources. In the application of mulclhing teclnology for an effective utilization of water and fertility
resources, much attention should be paid to collect back the waste plastic fihn. If it is possible, an extenisioni of degradation
plastic film is recomunended to prevent ",isite pollutioni. Soil fertility slhould be improved for a sustainable development.
