                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
     The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank Group for two
purposes: first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is
producing the expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through
the dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
World Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to
those that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those
for which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to
generate important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to
development policy operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing agency
or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements,
toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government performance and
implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly Satisfactory,
Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is a Performance Assessment of two Bank-supported activities to assist the urban
sanitation and drainage sectors in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

The first was an investment project, the Three Cities Sanitation Project (Cr 3211) for
which the World Bank approved a Credit of SDR 59.4 million on May 18, 1999—
US$80.5 million equivalent at the time. The Credit was 87.3 percent disbursed after the
equivalent of US$11.9 million was cancelled in two tranches, the first on January 16,
2007 and the second when the Credit was closed on June 30, 2008, three years later than
planned.

The second was a piece of analytical and advisory work, entitled Sanitation Management
for Urban Areas (P116054). It constituted Bank-supported economic and sector work on
Vietnam‘s sanitation sector. Work on this study, contracted by and supervised throughout
by the World Bank, began in January 2009. It was 100 percent financed by an Australian
Agency for International Development (AusAID) grant of US$210,000 in January 2009,
which was fully spent within the original budget by the time the Bank presented the final
report to the government of Vietnam in June 2011. The review of this study is part of a
pilot effort by IEG that seeks to enhance the accountability and learning from analytic
work of this kind.

This report is based on a review of project documents, including the Implementation
Completion and Results Report, the Project Appraisal Document, legal documents and
project files, and on discussions held with Bank staff involved in the project in
Washington DC and Hanoi. An IEG mission visited Vietnam during November-
December 2010 to review results and met with more than 35 interlocutors, including
government officials and representatives of Haiphong City, Halong City, and Danang
City. The mission conducted field visits to project sites in these three project cities, where
it met with many project beneficiaries too. IEG gratefully acknowledges the courtesies
and attention of all these participants, and their keen interest in the project evaluation
process.

IEG selected this particular project and study for a field assessment in order to verify
their results as the important dialogue on the urban sanitation sector in Vietnam reaches a
crossroads of deciding where and how to make the massive investments needed. This
evaluation will also serve as an input into IEG‘s ongoing review of infrastructure
sustainability worldwide.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft report were sent to government
officials and agencies for their review and comments, however no comments were
received.

Summary
Vietnam‘s high growth in gross domestic product—7.1 percent per annum over the past
decade—is driven by the country‘s rapid industrialization and accelerated urbanization.
This means an ever-larger population is living in Vietnam‘s low-lying coastal and
riverine cities that are flood-prone, short on urban services, and vulnerable to natural
disasters. With higher incomes and an urban population growing at 3.1 percent per
annum, the demand for urban water consumption in these cities doubles every 20 years—
and so does the production of wastewater. There is thus an urgent need for sanitation,
understood here as a means of promoting public health by preventing human contact with
solid and liquid waste by their safe collection, disposal, and treatment.
Many cities in Vietnam have developed systems of storm drains for flood protection. In
the absence of dedicated sewerage networks, these drains also convey untreated sewage,
polluting watercourses and posing a public health hazard. Because investment costs of
completely new sewerage systems for large densely populated cities are huge and
operational costs very high, hardly any have been built. Thus, most urban households rely
upon on-site septic tanks, rarely cleaned and emptied. While poverty has been reduced in
recent years in Vietnam, low incomes among most urban households preclude their
contributing to the investment costs of new citywide systems that are still typically
subsidized by the central government. But Vietnam‘s market-oriented reforms have given
cost recovery a higher profile, at least to cover operations and maintenance (O&M) costs.
Vietnam‘s five-year national development plans have given priority to solving the
sanitation and drainage problems in the country‘s cities. Meanwhile, which technical
solutions work best remains hotly contested by sector experts. One option is for
completely new sewerage networks connecting residences and businesses to new
treatment plants—less polluting, but very costly. A second is the more extensive use of
the already widespread on-site septic tank—a more polluting but familiar lower-cost
approach. Currently, Vietnam is deciding which way to go. How the Bank has helped
Vietnam make its decisions underlies the present evaluation.
Bank assistance reviewed here came in two forms: (i) a US$119 million investment
project, the 1999-2008 Three Cities Sanitation Project; and (ii) a US$210,000 study
(economic and sector work, ESW), entitled Sanitation Management for Urban Areas.
Three Cities Sanitation Project
This was the first Bank-financed urban sanitation project in Vietnam, although it
complemented the 1997-2004 Vietnam Water Supply Project (Cr N0260) that had the
same client cities, namely Haiphong City, Danang City, and Halong/Cam Pha City.
Project objectives were to achieve: (i) better urban sanitation services; (ii) reduced
pollution; (iii) reduced flooding; (iv) better solid waste management; and (v) financially
viable local sanitation utilities. They were moderately relevant to the 2007-2011 Country
Partnership Strategy and Vietnam‘s own Eleventh Socio-Economic Development Plan
for 2011-2015. Both focus explicitly upon reducing cities‘ exposure to environmental and
flood risks.
Project design was substantially relevant for incorporating physical investments in
sewage treatment, septic tanks, drainage channels, and the collection and disposal of solid
                                            viii


waste, as well as strengthening the institutions responsible for them. The outputs of these
components, through an implicit results chain, could lead to the achievement of the stated
objectives. The scale and financing of the original design was realistic and relevant.
Project startup was slow. It had to allow for the re-design of some components that
needed to be scaled up and for protracted approval processes to take their course.
Procurement processing was particularly drawn out, but there were no reported cases of
mis-procurement under this project. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) is rated modest,
overall. The lack of baseline data, the absence of targets, and the loose relationship of
some performance indicators to the project‘s objectives weakened its design. M&E was
barely implemented and little utilized.
Substantial results were achieved in two areas – improved sanitation infrastructure and
services and better solid waste management. In the case of sanitation infrastructure,
however, the lack of exact baselines and target figures of service provision means that we
do not know precisely by how much infrastructure and service levels improved. We do
know, however, that sewage interceptors and treatment plants were practically non-
existent in the participating cities in 1998. Better solid waste management had substantial
results, especially in Danang City, where the project introduced system-wide
improvements to collection, disposal and treatment for the first time.
Results for the remaining three objectives were modest at best. Reduced pollution of
drains, rivers, and the sea cannot be established definitively because there is no
systematic evidence that allows a comparison of today‘s pollution levels with those
before the project. Reduction in flooding was reported anecdotally by local officials and
residents, thanks to project investments in new drainage channels and pumping stations,
as well as the rehabilitation of existing ones. But the limited availability of comparable
(and inevitably complex) baseline and target data that include precipitation, tides and
other exogenous factors, preclude a systematic assessment of the degree of achievement
in this regard. Financially viable sanitation utilities are still a long way off and
constraints to adjusting tariffs persist. However, utilities gained greater autonomy and
experience through the project, building up their own cadres of young engineers in the
process.
With respect to the project‘s efficiency, cost savings allowed the project to expand the
scale of investments. The cost-benefit analysis conducted at appraisal and project closing
reported an economic rate of return of around 15 percent, but it inappropriately depended
upon tourism expenditures for half the project benefits. More appropriate indicators
would have looked for evidence of higher real estate values representing a stronger
demand for an improved urban environment.
The overall outcome of the project is rated moderately satisfactory. There were
moderate shortcomings in the project‘s efficient achievement of its objectives. Stronger
results came through the introduction of primary and secondary sewage treatment on a
significant scale for the first time in half a century and proper solid waste management.
The lack of systematic and convincing evidence of the reduced pollution and flooding
and of the financial viability of sanitation and drainage companies were the main
weaknesses. The risk to development outcome is rated significant owing to shortcomings
in cost recovery and the continued reluctance of households to maintain septic tanks.
Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory with a design focused upon
                                              ix


appropriate activities, active supervision, but weak M&E. Borrower performance was
moderately satisfactory with strong government ownership of the project set against the
protracted processing of approvals at all levels that made a three-year extension of project
closing necessary.
The Lessons of the investment project include:
•   While good project design makes the links between project interventions and
    outcomes explicit through a results-chain, the rationale for attribution needs to have a
    sound theoretical foundation and appropriate performance indicators. Urban
    infrastructure investments in sanitation and drainage can produce outputs that
    contribute to generalized project objectives, such as reduced environmental pollution
    and flooding, but the links can be complex and difficult to monitor. Achievements
    can only be accurately measured when baselines are clear and data are current on all
    relevant performance indicators.
•   The project showed that urban households were satisfied with the septic tanks
    provided, regarding them as adequate final solutions to their sanitation needs, making
    connections to local sewer networks appear unnecessary to these households. As
    Vietnam continues to urbanize rapidly, sector specialists will need to monitor how
    well the household septic tank solution continues to perform with increasing urban
    densities. At the same time, the specialists would need to identify the incentives that
    households might need to eventually move to systemic solutions for urban sanitation.
•   In low-lying coastal and riverine cities vulnerable to floods, natural disasters and
    environmental pollution, as are most of Vietnam‘s, investment and O&M of urban
    infrastructure can be very expensive. Financing must be assured, usually government
    funding for investment and cost recovery from users for part of O&M.
Sanitation Management for Urban Areas (Economic and Sector Work)
Preparation of this study, reviewed on a pilot basis here, started as the Three Cities
Sanitation Project was winding down in 2008. The study, supported by the Bank and the
Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), addressed sector issues at
the national level, beyond the scope of the prior project, as the government was renewing
its policy, strategy, and operations in the sanitation sector.
The clients of the study in Vietnam included the Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of
Planning and Investment, and the local ―community of practice‖ of sanitary and hydraulic
engineers, supported by international contractors and consultants. The explicit objective
of the study was to provide policy makers with: (a) a baseline assessment of sanitation
services in urban centers, including technical, financial and institutional issues; and (b)
suggestions on best practices for on-site sanitation (then and now the solution applied to
Vietnam‘s cities) that would not pose a risk to human health and protect the environment.
An accurate baseline is a necessary input to sector policymaking and strategy
formulation, and can help a government poised to make major decisions in these areas.
Best practice technical solutions, too, will be needed, with special regard to their cost
effectiveness given their high cost. At startup, the study focused principally upon the
technical side of sanitation, to produce a handbook of recommended solutions for local
authorities. Its attention shifted to the bigger policy picture of sanitation and drainage for
Vietnam‘s cities as a whole, as both the government and the Bank wanted.
                                              x


The work was fully funded by AusAID and contracted and managed by the World Bank.
The concept note was approved in February 2009, eight months after the closing of the
Three Cities Sanitation Project. A well-attended workshop on the draft final report was
held in Hanoi in August 2010. The final version of the report for government was
delivered in May 2011.
The results for this piece of economic and sector work were satisfactory. The study
provided a baseline assessment of urban sanitation services, and also provided some
suggestions on best practices for on-site sanitation. Particularly at the national level, it
helped raise sector stakeholders‘ awareness of the challenges posed by the precarious
baseline of urban sanitation infrastructure and services in the country. The sector
dialogue in Vietnam was considerably enhanced through the August 2010 workshop to
discuss the preliminary findings. In hindsight, it appears that a workshop of this kind has
been more effective in eliciting government responses than the formal delivery of the
final version of a report, with which officials were familiar in its earlier draft forms. The
study helped bring the sanitation sector to the forefront of a public expenditure review for
Vietnam that the Bank is currently preparing.
The study was also satisfactory in terms of its strategic relevance and ownership. It was
consistent with and relevant to Country Partnership Strategy priorities of improving
access of the poor to sanitation, and improving the quality of urban services themselves
for stronger environmental protection and public health improvements. The report was
very timely in that it was prepared as the government was designing a major investment
program in the sanitation sector, helping to document the baseline constraints facing the
sector. The delivery of the study coincided with the acceleration of program
implementation scheduled to run to 2025. IEG noted that ownership of the study was
strong at the level of the central government in Hanoi. A large number of government
officials attended the August 2010 workshop, providing feedback to help update an
earlier draft of the report.
The quality of the product was satisfactory. The Bank has had a half-century of
worldwide experience of supporting sanitation improvement in cities and was thus be
well positioned to provide the high quality professional and technical advice that
Vietnam‘s sought and continues to seek for this sector. Several senior Bank experts from
the sanitation sector worked on the report. The study launched its own survey to collect
primary data from 105 households in Ho Chi Minh City, Can Tho, and Quang Ngai to
find out what kind of sanitation services they had and what kind they wanted. The reports
made very few explicit references to the drainage and sanitation experiences of other
countries, but this should not be seen as a shortcoming of the work. Vietnam‘s urban
sanitation challenges are very specific to the conditions of the country‘s cities and may be
unique in at least two respects: their low-lying coastal sites make sanitation and drainage
operations costly, and no major city has purpose-built sewerage collection network. The
specific approach to Vietnam was well served by the study, which carried out a thorough
analysis of the institutional arrangements for the sector. The report included 14 specific
recommendations on the technical, financing, and institutional aspects of sanitation in
Vietnam.
The study was also satisfactory in terms of dissemination and sustained dialogue. The
final report was formally sent in June 2011 to the Ministry of Construction, Vietnam‘s
principal government authority for sanitation, but the effective dissemination of the work

1. Context of Vietnam’s Urban Sanitation Challenge
GROWTH ON THE ECONOMIC AND URBAN FRONTS

1.1      Vietnam‘s high GDP growth—7.1 percent per annum over the past decade1—is
driven by rapid industrialization and accelerated urbanization. This means an ever-larger
population living in cities. Most of these cities in Vietnam are low-lying, flood-prone coastal
or riverine settlements, and have to face harsh environmental constraints posed by their
challenging physical locations. By hosting new market driven economic activities, these
rapidly expanding cities are a direct product of Vietnam‘s market-friendly reforms. They are
also a target for sector-specific reforms, such as in urban sanitation2 and drainage reviewed
here, as greater public service responsibilities are decentralized to them. This report reviews
Bank support for these reforms through an investment project and analytical and advisory
activities (AAA) that consisted of economic and sector work (ESW) in Vietnam‘s urban
sanitation sector.

1.2     With higher incomes and an urban population growing at 3.1 percent per annum, the
demand for urban water consumption doubles every 20 years—so does the production of
wastewater. These trends still have a long way to go. Only 28 percent of Vietnam‘s people
live in urban areas, well behind China‘s 44 percent and Indonesia‘s 53 percent. Although
Vietnam hosts none of the world‘s 10 million-people-plus megacities yet, the country already
has major urban centers: Ho Chi Minh City (pop 5.7 million); Hanoi (pop. 2.5 million);
Haiphong City (pop 1.8 million); and Danang City (pop 0.5 million). Sanitation and drainage
services for the 25.2 million people that live in these and other cities are inadequate. Less
than 10 percent of wastewater is treated, and flooding is common. Haiphong City and
Danang City, along with Halong City (pop. 203,000); and Cam Pha City (pop. 166,000)
participated in the project reviewed here.

GEOGRAPHICAL, SOCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CONSTRAINTS UPON VIETNAM’S CITIES

1.3     Located at, or even below mean sea level in zones with annual precipitation in the
1,500-2,200 mm range, Vietnam‘s cities suffer repeated flooding. They are also vulnerable to
typhoons and other natural disasters that can make the flooding worse, especially with
climate change bringing rising sea levels. Many cities have developed systems of storm
drains, dykes, drainage channels and retention ponds for flood protection. Storm drains and
channels also convey sewage, since the cities do not have separate sewerage systems—
raising major environmental and health risks. They convey untreated sewage directly into
rivers and the sea, polluting beaches and waterfronts. High tides and flooding back up
sewage into the city, where it can propagate water-borne diseases to which children
especially are prone. The situation is made worse by inadequate solid waste management


1
  With a GDP per capita to US$1,052 in 2009 (compared with just US$356 in 1998), Vietnam is now classified
as a low-middle income country. Ever-higher incomes look assured. On the otherwise bright macroeconomic
front, inflation, reaching 23.1 percent per annum, is considered a significant risk.
2
 In this report, sanitation is understood as a means of promoting public health by preventing human contact
with solid and liquid waste by their safe collection, disposal and treatment
                                               2


where discarded trash blocks what little flow drains might otherwise have. As coastal
settlements, the project cities faced all these challenges.

1.4     In such topography, conveying storm drainage and sewerage cannot rely on gravity
alone. It requires large-scale and continual pumping that can be very expensive, something
that the cities can ill afford. For sewerage investment, the Bank‘s recent ESW estimated that
investments of US$10.3 billion would be needed over the 2011-2025 period, ten times the
spending over the previous decade (World Bank and AusAID 2011 p. 2), and far more than
thought necessary at the time of the appraisal of the investment project reviewed here (PAD
p. 2). Other estimates put the costs even higher; US$13.1 billion according to the government
and US$16.2 billion by the University of Hanoi (Ahn 2010). The investment project
reviewed later in this PAR, the Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project (Cr. 3211) made
modest inroads into upgrading the sewerage systems of its client cities




Figure 1.1 Haiphong City: Sewerage and drainage to be improved
1.5     Without sewerage networks, 76 percent of urban households use on-site septic tanks
for their sanitation. Most of the remainder use pit latrines. Septic tanks are usually built as
sealed concrete containers dug beneath the bathroom of the house, into which black water
from the toilet is directly discharged. They may or may not overflow into storm drainage or
seep into the subsoil. Either way, they pollute watercourses since no specific sewage
treatment is involved. Septic tanks in Vietnam‘s cities were the focus of the Bank‘s ESW
entitled Sanitation Management for Urban Areas, reviewed later in this report. A crucial
question for the future of the sector in Vietnam is how far cities should continue to rely upon
septic tank solutions and how far they should implement complete sewerage collection and
treatment networks for the first time. The experience of the investment project reviewed in
                                                 3


the first part of this report illustrated how these alternatives worked in practice in the selected
cities. On the other hand, the experience of the ESW reviewed in the second part helped
throw light upon the policy and strategic implications of these alternatives at the national
level.

1.6     Social and institutional constraints in addressing urban sanitation can be significant in
Vietnam. While less than 10 percent of the urban population is reported as currently being
below the poverty line, low incomes prevail among urban households who cannot contribute
to financing the very costly investments that are necessary. Even households able to pay may
be unwilling to do so. This is particularly true of many users of septic tanks who feel that
they owe nothing for sanitation services, which they provide themselves. Furthermore, within
Vietnam‘s socialist system, water and sanitation services have traditionally been provided
without charge, or at most, only a nominal fee.

THE REFORM BACKGROUND

1.7     Potential cost recovery is but one small part of Vietnam‘s pro-market renovation Doi
Moi program begun in 1987. Doi moi foresaw much productive economic business shifting to
the hands of the private sector. While the provision of public services, such as urban
sanitation, would remain firmly in public sector hands, the services would have to operate on
a more commercial basis—including cost recovery, even if not to the point of profitability.
Market reform on this basis has taken hold in Vietnam despite occasional setbacks of price
controls to tackle rising inflation. As recently as January 2011, the 11th National Congress of
Vietnam‘s Communist Party, the highest-level national assembly that meets only once every
five years, reaffirmed the country‘s commitment to doi moi.

1.8     On another front, reform has led to decentralization of local development
responsibilities to provincial and municipal governments – significant for Vietnam, but
modest by international standards. Local authorities at these levels have acquired more
responsibility for planning, implementing and operating urban services and infrastructure.
Most have their own sanitation and drainage utilities, that carry the URENCO (Urban
Environmental Companies) acronym in English (except in Haiphong City where its
denomination is SADCO) and are responsible for the collection of storm water and
wastewater and the treatment of the latter. Water supply is in the hands of separate water
supply companies in each city. This separation has two important consequences. It constrains
the possibilities of subsidizing expensive sewerage services by the returns from more
profitable water supply services, a financing feature widely used in many countries. It also
blurs the dividing line between both the responsibilities and infrastructure for wastewater and
storm water collection, that are typically separate in higher income countries‘ cities better
endowed with urban infrastructure. These utilities have become more responsible for their
own administration, but autonomy is still a long way off as many important approvals still
have to be referred to government ministries in Hanoi. Wastewater tariff ceilings of no more
than 15 percent of the water tariff are set by a central government anxious to hold them down
to help cool inflation.

VIETNAM’S CURRENT SECTOR RESPONSES

1.9      Vietnam‘s five-year socio-economic development plan for 2006-2010 called for:
      ―Focus on the construction of provincial-level projects for drainage systems and
      environmental sanitation. In big cities and industrial parks, gradually apply modern
      technology to sewage and solid waste treatment, and support rural people to construct
      hygiene latrines and sanitation works. Invest in the development of drainage systems in
      cities, stop frequent inundation during rainy seasons; increase treatment of waste and
      sewage in cities, industrial parks, tourist centers and hospitals. (MPI – Ministry of
      Planning and Investment 2006 p. 124)

The current 2011-2015 Five Year Plan focuses on protecting cities against flooding as an
effective response to natural disasters and to strengthen their climate change resilience
(NASRV 2011). National planning and policy point in the direction to go, but not the
technical solutions to apply. There seem to be two of these.

1.10 The first, in line with the 2006-2010 Plan is to completely ―modernize‖ wastewater
management through developing complete sewage networks connecting individual
residences and businesses with main interceptors taking the effluent to modern treatment
plants. This approach could discharge only treated sewage that would not pollute
watercourses, leaving the storm drainage system to be just that. But the main disadvantage
would be the high cost.

1.11 The second would be to rely more extensively upon the common on-site septic tanks.
The main advantages of this approach are its low cost, and the use of technology familiar to
local authorities and the users themselves. Disadvantages include the environmental and
public health costs of pollution from septic tanks that cannot be cleaned or periodically
emptied as needed. Moreover, there is uncertainty as to whether they work or not as sewage
treatment facilities (World Bank AusAID 2011 p. 8).

1.12 On these two technical aspects alone, urban sanitation in Vietnam finds itself at a
crossroads. The direction taken will tie up Vietnam‘s huge urban environmental sanitation
sector for years to come. It will also determine how many resources need to be mobilized to
find and implement the necessary solutions. This report alone will not recommend the course
to take, but its review of the Bank support through an investment project and ESW can point
to how effective Bank involvement in the sector dialogue can be.

EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE

1.13 Investment operation: Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project. This was the first
Bank-financed investment operation in Vietnam‘s sanitation and drainage sectors. It provided
investment and technical assistance in these sectors in the following selected cities: Haiphong
City, Danang City, and two cities in Quang Nanh Province.3 The Three Cities operation used

3
  It was not the first Bank investment in these cities, however, that had been served by the earlier 1997-2004
Vietnam Water Supply Project (Cr N0036), that was financed by an International Development Association
(IDA) Credit of US$98.6 million that was 61.1 percent disbursed.
                                                         5


a standard investment project design with the aim of helping selected cities improve their
public health and economic development by investing more in better drainage works,
sewerage and sewage treatment, solid waste, and institutional development. By completion,
97.5 percent of US$123.8 million project spending was for physical investments. An IDA
Credit of US$94.3 led to actual disbursements of US$82.3 million financing 66.5 percent of
final costs. Prepared and implemented during 1998-2008, the operation closed three years
later than planned to allow the completion of all project works.

1.14 Economic and sector work: Vietnam Sanitation Management for Urban Areas:
This was the first piece of Bank economic and sector work (ESW) on sanitation in Vietnam.
As the Three Cities Sanitation Project was closing, it started out as a technical review of
alternative low-cost solutions for basic sanitation in Vietnam‘s cities and rural areas, inspired
by the technical debate noted above. It led into the broader policy agenda, identifying the
(precarious) baseline of sanitation services today and mapping a strategy for improvement
over a reasonable time frame and within a realistic budget envelope. The study‘s
US$210,000 cost was financed 100 percent by the Australian Agency for International
Development (AUSAID). Its fieldwork was mostly in the south of the country,
complementing the investment project‘s focus upon the north.

1.15 Other assistance: The World Bank was not the only player in Vietnam‘s sanitation
sector among donors. In 2010, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a US$45
million loan for a new water supply and sanitation project for the central region of the
country. UN Habitat has been working with government partners on the WATSAN initiative
of improving water supply and sanitation in the Mekong Delta region of southern Vietnam.
Project cities of the Bank operation received technical assistance in sanitation came from
bilateral donors, FINNIDA in Haiphong City, DANIDA in Quang Ninh and AUSAID in
Danang City.

2. Investment Project: Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation
Background
2.1      In the mid-1990s, the government requested Bank assistance to help prevent already
grave urban sanitation and drainage problems in selected cities from worsening4. Although it
was the first time in the sanitation sector per se, donors had previously provided assistance to
Vietnam‘s water sector, notably through the Vietnam Water Supply Project (Cr N0260)
partly financed by the Bank. Thus, in common with the historical experience of most
countries—developed and developing—Vietnam first gave attention to water supply and then
later to sanitation. As water supply deficits declined, increased supply itself gave rise to the
discharge of wastewater at levels not seen before.


4
 Participating cities were: (i) Haiphong City (pop. 1.8 million); (ii) Danang City (pop. 0.5 million); (iii) Halong
City (pop. 203,000); and (iv) Cam Pha City (pop. 166,000). The last two cities are both located in the province
of Quang Ninh that is treated as if it were the third city of the project‘s title. The operation‘s Project Agreement
was with four city drainage and environmental utilities. This report refers to the four client cities as Haiphong
City, Danang City, Halong City and Cam Pha City throughout the text.

The Objectives, Design, and Their Relevance
2.2     Rating of relevance of objectives – Substantial: Although guidelines call for
identical reporting of project objectives in the legal and technical documents, the project
objective formulations in this case are quite disparate between the two sources. For this
evaluation, however, the report assesses the achievement of the project objectives as they are
formulated in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA), where they are more directly
linked to measurable outcomes than the objectives formulated in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD) that are focused upon higher-order achievements of better public health
and increased economic development.5 Thus, project investments in sewage interceptors,
septic tanks, and solid waste collection for example, could lead directly to the better
sanitation and reduced pollution promised by the DCA project objectives. Likewise, project
investments in drainage could help achieve the aim of reduced flooding. Also, project
technical assistance and training to sanitation and drainage companies, if properly focused,
could lead through the results framework, to the financially viability sought. (Box 1).

2.3     The (DCA-formulated) objectives of the project remain substantially relevant to
Vietnam‘s most recent country partnership strategy (CPS) for 2007-2011 that prioritizes
better access by the poor to urban water and sanitation services (World Bank 2007 p. 7).
Given the general lack of urban sanitation services in Vietnam‘s cities, however, some higher
income households, too, can be expected to benefit from public service improvements. The
project objectives were particularly relevant to the call of the 2002 country assistance
strategy (CAS) to strengthen cities‘ resilience to natural disasters, particularly from flooding,
while recognizing the huge investments in sanitation and drainage infrastructure that would
be necessary to achieve that (World Bank 2002 p. 27).

2.4     Project objectives also supported the government‘s market-friendly and
decentralizing reform agenda by seeking to introduce commercial practices, particularly cost
recovery, to state-owned local sanitation and drainage companies, and by transferring greater
sector responsibilities to them. The aims of the project were also substantially relevant to the
goals of successive Five-Year Development Plans, particularly to the 2006-2010 Plan that
proposed to tackle the country‘s urban sanitation crisis head-on. They remain relevant to the
current 2011-2015 Plan that emphasizes protecting the environment and adapting to climate
change—both requiring sanitation and drainage improvements that the project sought.

2.5     The relevance of this environmental Category ―A‖6 project‘s objectives might have
been even higher had they given explicit attention to enhancing natural disaster resilience
that drainage improvements might bring by increasing project cities‘ preparedness for them.



5
 During implementation, the Bank project team wanted consistent objective statements in both documents, but
deferred on re-aligning the PAD and DCA versions. Such a change, as well as requiring Bank Board approval,
would have reopened negotiations with all involved ministries in Vietnam and seeking their formal approval
along with that of the prime minister‘s office—all with no guarantee of success.

 As per Bank operational policy OP 4.01, a Category ―A‖ project is one that ―is likely to have significant
adverse environmental impacts that are sensitive, diverse, or unprecedented‖ and whose environmental
assessment(s) prepared by the Borrower must ―recommend any measures needed to prevent, minimize, mitigate,

2.6     Rating of relevance of design – Substantial : While it did not do so explicitly, the
project design included some elements of a results chain that help make clear how project
interventions would lead, through intermediate outputs, to outcomes intended by the
objectives.

2.7     The design thus included components for generating the intended effects through the
project‘s implicit results chain. Thus drainage canal rehabilitation and new drainage systems
should help reduce flooding. Sewage collection and treatment, and solid waste management
should reduce pollution. The project design also included a small revolving fund to help
finance this. Solid waste management, also involving collection, disposal and treatment,

or compensate for adverse impacts and improve environmental performance.‖ (Op 4.01 section 8 revised Feb
2011)
                                               8


should upgrade the urban environment (as well as generate the health benefits just
mentioned). Project institutional development could help local utilities assume their
increased responsibility with stronger institutional and financial performance.

2.8     Pragmatically, the project chose to make incremental improvements to sewerage and
drainage infrastructure already in place—extending and refurbishing existing canals and
interceptors—most likely to lead to a short run impact. For a country that had had no
significant investment in urban sanitation since the French colonial period ended in 1954, this
was a major step in itself. A more radical and expensive solution, such as laying completely
new sewage interceptors and collection network for the first time in large densely occupied
cities was not pursued. It was not affordable, and maybe technically impossible to
implement in the densely populated larger cities especially. Solid waste management
introduced by the project included all elements—collection, disposal and treatment
systems—would contribute to the better sanitation services intended by the project.

2.9     IEG learned that several officials in Hanoi and in the provinces felt that the project
had been too small, financially, to make an impression upon the extensive sanitation needs of
the project cities—too small, in other words, to have a significant impact through a results
chain. These people were familiar with much larger resource mobilization in this sector, such
as the government‘s target of investing of US$10.8 billion over the 2010-2025 period. While
there can be no doubt that very much more than the US$99.7 million spent by the project
would be needed to fix all the sanitation and drainage problems of these cities, there is
evidence that more resources could not have been disbursed through an operation like this.
At completion, US$11.9 million of the IDA Credit was cancelled. One reason for this may
have been the devaluation of the Vietnamese dong during project implementation that
reduced the US dollar amount needed to reimburse the local currency costs of the project. A
second reason is that the cities had access to alternative grant funding by the government, ten
times more than available through the project in the case of Haiphong, for example. A third
reason is the limited capacity to invest more, even with a three year extension of the closing
date, in new components of sanitation that are lumpy and have to be designed from the
ground up. Taken together, these factors suggest that the scale of the operation as designed
was pragmatic and just about right. Furthermore, they show that the strategic sectoral goal of
replacing government grants as the main source for sanitation investment remains a long way
off.

Implementation Experience
2.10 Project start up was slow. A first (small) disbursement was made nearly one year after
the project‘s on-time credit effectiveness. Local officials told IEG of protracted reviews and
approvals of the earliest disbursement requests especially. They also spoke of last minute re-
designing of components as another cause of delay. With actual contract costs lower than
appraisal estimates, project resources were freed up for further investments. Proposals for
additional and redesigned sub-projects had to go through lengthy high-level re-review and
approval processes in Hanoi as if they were part of a new second project. These helped the
project close three years later than planned. Re-design happened, for instance, when the
capacity of the Halong City sewage treatment plant was doubled from 3,500 m3/day to 7,000
m3/day, after differences of opinion about whether sewage treatment should be on-site
                                                       9


through septic tanks or off-site through treatment plants had been settled. This debate goes to
the heart of the strategic choices for urban sanitation facing Vietnam to which the ESW
reviewed in this report contributed (chapter 3).

2.11 Implementing the project was a challenge for local authorities unused to its scale—
that they still believed to be inadequate. They had to take on much more responsibility for
execution than for previous centrally driven projects, for instance. Beforehand, larger
investments like these had been implemented directly by central government. The capability
of the contractors was also less than expected. Actual construction supervision under the
project was 575 person-months (125 international plus 450 national), more than double the
194 person-months planned (69 international plus 125 national).

2.12 Procurement, especially through international competitive bidding (ICB), proved
particularly challenging for local agencies and the government to manage. It took time to
prepare bidding documents that met Bank requirements. Local officials told IEG of long
delays in getting government approval of the documents themselves, the pre-qualifications,
and the selected winning bid, required in every case. Local officials believed that most
winning ICB bids went to foreign firms. They reckoned that Vietnamese firms could compete
but did not do so for two reasons. Either they were not ready to do so, or did not realize they
were entitled to. When a foreign firm won, the result was not exactly as it appeared. In one
case, the winning bid came from a Chinese firm that sub-contracted all the work to its
Vietnamese partners7. Local officials felt that ICB brought little additional benefit than
would have been achieved through local bidding. But lower prices are to be expected from
greater competition, even when subcontracting back to local firms occurs. The experiences of
this project nevertheless suggest that Vietnamese firms need to be better informed and
encouraged to participate in all types of competitive bidding, abroad as well as at home.

SAFEGUARDS

2.13 Involuntary resettlement: The appraisal estimated that 1,505 households would be
permanently affected by the project, somewhat higher than the 1,189 counted by the project‘s
three detailed resettlement action plans (479 in Haiphong City, 531 in Danang City, and 179
in Halong City and Cam Pha City) (PAD p. 17). The three action plans were prepared
thoroughly by local consultants in accordance with the Bank‘s operational directive 4.30 on
involuntary resettlement, with special attention given to ensuring full compensation to
project-affected households, after surveying their needs, assuring their participation together
with a grievance process for those who did not agree with the terms. Larger project works
resulting from re-designs led to more affected households, detailed in three more action plans
(362 in Haiphong City; 187 in Danang, and 142 in Halong City an Cam Pha City). The six
action plans were very thorough and detailed (covering more than 500 pages altogether).
Local sanitation utilities played front-line roles in implementing the resettlement. In Danang,
IEG learned that the negotiations with some affected households were protracted as they held
out for more compensation. After the utility raised the initial offer, agreement was reached
through a process that appeared to follow Bank safeguard guidelines.

7
 According to the Region, these factors applied only to bids for goods contracts, most of which went to foreign
contractors.
                                              10


2.14 Environmental: Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and environmental
management plans (EMPs) were prepared for the major investment components of this
environmental category ―A‖ project. Local consultants meticulously prepared twelve
volumes of environmental assessment reports, totaling nearly 1,900 pages of text, data and
plans, covering all aspects of the investments in question. While local authorities exercised
due diligence through this work, its implications for project execution were not fully
understood by all contractors. Some were not always aware that they should not start work
before EIA/EMP approval and ―no-objection‖ from the Bank. In some cases, this meant that
contractors had to redo work prematurely done in order to make it compliant with the
environmental safeguards upheld by the reports.

FIDUCIARY

2.15 Delays in managing project procurement affected this project as they did in other
operations in Vietnam. The day-to-day administration of procurement was delegated to the
local utilities, but the decision-making authority over the approval of shortlisting and
awarding bids remained with the central government. These processes led to delays and
contributed to the three-year extension of the project closing date, but no case of misprocure-
ment was reported, as had been the case in Danang under the earlier Water Supply Project.
Compliance with Bank requirements of financial management was assured most of the time.
There were a few exceptions especially in the earlier stages of implementation when
Haiphong City, for example, submitted its audited financial accounts late. But performance
improved as cities developed their financial reporting skills for the project.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION

2.16 Overall rating of M&E – Modest. Project M&E design would have been stronger
with clear baselines and a more consistent choice of performance indicators to measure the
achievement of project objectives. The cities did not have strong M&E systems before the
project. The project itself did little to establish them to help trace clear baselines and keep
cities focused upon progress toward achieving final outcomes—not just delivering project
components. This could have been done, for example, by the use of good indicators such as
the incidence of waterborne diseases as evidence of the impact of project sanitation
improvements upon public health (with appropriate caveats recognizing other contributory
factors). But using tourism arrivals and spending was a poor choice by the project‘s
cost:benefit analysis of indicators of project impact upon city economic development for
several reasons: (i) there are many drivers of tourism other than better urban sanitation; (ii)
only net tourist spending should be considered, after other costs (transport, accommodation
and meals) have been deducted; (iii) it presumes that a city without a major tourism function,
such as Haiphong, would have no economic benefit from the project; (iv) it goes beyond the
expected results of the more specific DCA formulation of the project‘s objectives.. M&E
design was stronger in the choice of intermediate outcome indicators, such as the volume of
solid waste removed, reduced incidence of flooding, funds lent for household sanitation, cost
recovery, but rarely were project target values of these indicators made clear up-front. The
project task team was aware of the weaknesses of M&E design early in project
implementation, even considering revising the PDOs and monitoring indicators to bring them
                                                11


more into line with each other. But the proposed amendment was rejected on the grounds of
avoiding the heavy and protracted bureaucratic attention it would have to receive in Hanoi.

2.17 M&E implementation: Each city‘s project management unit was responsible for
M&E, contracting some collection activities and assembling the data, but actual results were
few, leaving the project without systematic evidence of its impact upon the environment, for
instance. The Bank and local project teams mostly focused upon stimulating the faltering
implementation of the project itself.

2.18 M&E utilization: Given the partial implementation of an M&E system built around
less than fully relevant indicators, IEG could find no evidence of monitoring results being
used to guide the planning and implementation of this particular project or other programs of
environmental improvement in these cities.

Achievement of the Objectives
BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES IN CITIES

2.19 Efficacy rating: Substantial. There is some evidence of better environmental and
sanitation services through the project‘s sewage treatment plants with associated interceptors
and on-site septic tanks. During site visits, IEG saw an upgraded urban environment in the
areas directly affected by the operation‘s investments in project cities. We do know that
baseline sanitation infrastructure and services in these areas were very poor. This is still the
case today in many other areas of the cities (Figure 1). Sewerage interceptors were
practically non-existent in these cities in 1998, for instance. At the national level, however, it
is clear that there is still a long way to go to reach the government‘s target of treating 50
percent of all wastewater collected by 2020. The present level is still only 10 percent (World
Bank and AusAID 2011), not much above the 9 percent (national) baseline figure reported at
appraisal. The study reviewed in the next chapter estimated that in 2010 Vietnam‘s urban
wastewater treatment capacity was 0.36 million m3/day, just 7.8 percent of the daily water
supply (World Bank/AusAID 2010 p. 37). We have no definitive findings of the technical
efficiency achievements of the project‘s sewage treatment. IEG gathered sporadic evidence
of the quality of the water discharged from treatment plants (discussed in more detail below)
but this cannot be set against baseline measures prior to the project, nor targets set, neither of
which was available for this project.

2.20 Sewage interceptors and treatment plants: While actual project investments in
these components were made much as planned, the results they achieved were mixed. The
project financed nine treatment plants (five for sewage and four for septic tank sludge), 46
kms of sewage interceptors and 37 pumping stations in cities that did not have services on
this scale prior to the project. The ICR reported (p. 10) that more people benefited than
planned from these investments; against an appraisal expectation of 1.3 million, 1.7 million
actually benefited. But the greater number is more due to population increase in the areas
served than a wider coverage of the services. Even more beneficiaries—1.8 million—would
be likely had the urban population growth of the project areas matched the 3.1 percent annual
average growth reported for Vietnam‘s cities. Whatever the exact figure, about two-thirds of
                                               12


the total population of the project cities benefitted. From field visits and discussions with
local officials, IEG noted project performance across the cities.

2.21 Haiphong City was unable to find a site for a sewage treatment plant, so that none
was included in the project, leaving the country‘s third largest city still without such
treatment. New sewage interceptors were laid, but with some difficulties, according to local
officials. The contractors were barely able to locate drainage system bottlenecks owing to a
lack of proper maps and records and the system‘s dual function of carrying both storm water
and sewage. A sludge treatment plant at Wang Hai/Trang Cat was implemented but not fully
operational at the time of IEG‘s visit. The plant‘s weighbridge (for arriving trucks) was not
working, and plant records showed that there had been no deliveries in the previous three
months. Meantime, the project fleet of six collection trucks was stationary in the patio,
looking like they had barely been used (Figure 2). The Bank‘s study reviewed later in this
assessment reported similar non-use in other cities (World Bank and AusAID 2011). In this
case, a lack of demand by householders for septic tank cleaning meant that there was no
agreement between the local community committee and the plant to carry out the work. In
addition, the trucks were too large to access many septic tanks in houses located in narrow
streets and alleyways—a probable design error of the component. Without emptying and
cleaning, effluent accumulating in the septic means that in the short run, black water will leak
into the surrounding soil or run off into nearby storm drains. In the longer run, septage will
fill the tank.




Figure 2.1 Haiphong City: parked sludge collection trucks
2.22 Danang City made more investment in sewage treatment than other project cities.
IEG visited two of the four treatment plants financed by the project. IEG did not see readings
                                              13


of the wastewater collected by the treatment plans, but as indicated by the 13 mg/liter
biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of their discharges, well below the national ceiling of 25
mg/liter, their simple low-cost anaerobic treatment of relying just upon sedimentation and
filtering seemed effective. Such a value is usually only achieved by more expensive aerobic,
sometimes called tertiary, treatment that requires pumping and circulating air through the
treatment tanks and the high electricity bills to do so. The actual capacity and throughput of
the project plants is not well recorded and thus, not fully understood. IEG learned that the
anaerobic treatment was taking longer than expected, thereby reducing the plant‘s throughput
and capacity. The earliest operations provoked complaints by nearby residents about the foul
odors emanating from the plant, later controlled by laying tarpaulins, called ―floating
covers‖, across the anaerobic ponds. As well as containing the smell, they also captured
methane gas for easy burn off (Figure 3).




Figure 2.2 Danang City: Sewage treatment plant with tarpaulin
2.23 The septic sludge treatment plant visited by IEG in Halong City was fully operational.
Gravity-driven effluent underwent anaerobic treatment. The outflow was clean enough to use
for filling fish tanks at the end of the line. The subsequent discharge of efficiently treated
sewage into Halong Bay no doubt contributed to the environmental sustainability of
Vietnam‘s number one tourist attraction.

2.24 Septic tanks: Through the revolving fund it helped establish, the project financed
more than 36,000 septic tanks in individual homes in the project cities, some 6.7 percent of
all their households. The fund enjoyed government support and was managed effectively by
the Vietnam Women‘s Union, whose representatives told IEG of a strong demand for micro-
                                                       14


loans and a 100 percent payback record. Local representatives reported to IEG that the
revolving fund continues to operate.8

2.25 Shortcoming of this component was its failure to address operational and technical
issues surrounding the use of on-site septic tanks in Vietnam‘s cities, in particular the lack of
servicing and even whether the ―treatment‖ of sewage in these tanks is effective. IEG saw
new septic tanks installed through the project underneath bathrooms located at the back of
lots that cannot be accessed for servicing. They thus re-create the old problem conditions
highlighted at appraisal where: ―most existing septic tanks have been constructed inside
users‘ houses, usually under the living room or toilet floor making difficult the access for
emptying‖ (PAD p. 70). This experience concurs with the lack of activity, already noted in
this report, in servicing septic tanks that IEG observed in Haiphong. Also, the lack of
monitoring of the new septic tanks leaves us to learn little about their technical performance
in treating sewage, or about the impact of their outflows or seepage on the environment.
Hence the ESW‘s call, reviewed in chapter 3, to verify the effectiveness of these septic tanks.

REDUCED POLLUTION OF DRAINS, RIVERS, AND THE SEA

2.26 Efficacy rating: Modest. Systematic and convincing evidence of the project‘s impact
upon reducing the pollution of drainage channels, rivers and the sea is not readily available.
The kind of data needed to make a convincing case would include: (i) before–project baseline
measures of water quality—such as the incidence of fecal coliforms—at strategic points in
drains, rivers and coastal waters around the urban area; (ii) time series measurements of these
indicators during project implementation and beyond; and (iii) arguments attributing changes
observed to project interventions, taking into account or excluding other possible causes.
Project M&E did not systematically assemble this kind of evidence, leaving the question of
the environmental impact of this project open.

2.27 On the other hand, IEG found evidence of environmental improvements to specific
areas, even if this only meant shifting a vector of pollution from one place to another. The
project thus helped reduce trash disposal and untreated sewage discharge into the Halong
Bay tourist hotspot, thanks to project solid waste and sanitation investments in Halong City
and Cam Pha City. Also thanks to the project, Danang City’s Thanh Binh beach may now
be used again for swimming for the first time in 15 years—a very visible improvement.
Diverting pollution away from this one area may not make much difference to overall levels
of coastal pollution around Danang, but it can have a positive effect in demonstrating
concrete results achieved in the relatively short term. This did not work for the project‘s
public toilets, however, only one fifth of the total intended were built, usually over the
objections of nearby residents who feared that they would become poorly maintained
odorous facilities unwanted in their neighborhoods.


8
  Although the project exceeded its target of 31,000 septic tanks, there was potential to finance even more
through the revolving fund: typically the fund provided micro-loans of no more than US$150 directly to
households to cover their costs of installing a septic tank, to be repaid in 2 years‘ time at most. Based on that
information, the $3.1 million fund should have been able to finance at least 20,667 septic tanks per two years of
operation.
                                                        15


REDUCED FLOODING

2.28 Efficacy rating: Modest. The project cities, flood-prone and vulnerable to natural
disasters, gained some relief from flooding as a result of this project according to local
officials and residents. But the limited availability of comparable (and inevitably complex)
baseline and target data preclude a systematic assessment of the degree of achievement in
this regard. Without costly and large-scale pumping, the complete elimination of flooding
may not be possible in cities, large areas of which are at or below sea level. Project M&E did
not describe the flooding baseline conditions in these cities or the targets to be achieved, so
we cannot tell if the results reported at completion represent an improvement upon the pre-
project conditions. Among the M&E data needed for the flood prone areas would be: (i) the
frequency of flooding (per year, or storm return intervals); (ii) the intensity of flooding
(depth in meters and area affected in square meters); (iii) duration (hours/days of floodwaters
above a certain depth); and (iv) the relevant precipitation. Even without this data, the
continued vulnerability of a city like Haiphong, for instance, is evident from project-built
drainage channels almost overflowing even during the dry season occasion of IEG‘s visit
(Figure 4). Local anecdotal accounts of flooding were many and sometimes




Figure 2.3 Haiphong City: Drainage channels full in dry season
inconsistent. They all showed, however, that flooding remains in the forefront of the minds
of residents in these low-lying coastal cities. 9 The project nevertheless made its planned

 Haiphong is particularly vulnerable, sharing the fate of Venice, Italy. Both cities are sinking and presently no
part of their urban areas is more than five meters above sea level, with a mean ―altitude‖ of just 2.8 meters
above sea level.
                                               16


investments in clearing and widening drainage channels, building new ones, and constructing
dams and holding ponds to delay flash floods. The largest holding pond in Haiphong has
become the Phuong Luy Lake, now used by local people for recreation. Some of these
beneficiaries, interviewed informally by IEG, spoke of city‘s past severe flooding in 1997
and1999 that has not been repeated since. The IEG mission heard similar stories in Danang
City, where the local People‘s Committee reported that there had been no repetition of the
Hue Xuan flood of 1995 that had left some city streets under three meters of water. The
better conditions today do not tell us whether they are the result of the project investments or
whether it is because the 1995 storm has not returned. Urban flooding as a natural disaster
risk remains very much on the national agenda in the 11th 2011-2015 Five Year Plan.
Government officials also made it clear to IEG in the mission‘s wrap-up meeting in Hanoi,
that they wanted more Bank assistance to help deal with this threat.

IMPROVED COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID WASTE

2.29 Efficacy rating: Substantial. The project improved solid waste management through
introducing complete collection, disposal, and treatment systems in Danang City, as well as
providing the sanitary landfills in Halong City (2) and Can Pha City, those cities‘ first. The
project did not include such a disposal and treatment system for Haiphong City, as Finland‘s
donor, FINNIDA, provided this through separate bilateral assistance. By implementation
completion Halong City was collecting 125,000 tons of solid waste per annum, and Cam Pha
City 66,000 tons, multiples of their respective project targets of 50,000 tons and 24,000 tons
respectively. The project target of 170,000 tons per annum was fully met in Danang City too,
which is currently collecting more than 180,000 tons.

2.30 Through the project, Danang City completely retooled its solid waste collection and
disposal system. Thanks to the provision of standardized trashcans, routinely maintained and
repaired as needed in backyard workshops, and regular collection schedules, trash was picked
up for the first time in low-income areas and continues to be. This helps prevent the disposal
of trash into the city‘s drainage canals, thereby reducing flooding. Garbage collection into
formerly inaccessible areas had been made possible by the widespread use of pedi-carts, as
well as motorized collection vehicles of different sizes. The smallest vehicles take the trash
to one of 12 small transfer stations established by the project, where the solid waste is
compacted into larger containers and taken to the disposal site in 20-ton trucks. Smaller 11-
ton compactor trucks financed by the project collect solid waste from larger residences and
businesses along the main city thoroughfares, taking it directly to these sites. Although never
popular among nearby residents, as in most cities worldwide, the transfer stations visited by
IEG were clean and well organized (Figures 5 and 6).

2.31 The project-financed disposal site was both Danang City‘s first sanitary landfill and
the first landfill in Vietnam that included properly designed cells for treating hazardous
waste. It replaced three dumpsites, now closed, where trash was discarded without any order
or treatment, posing public health and leachate pollution risks. During IEG‘s visit to the new
landfill, a continuous stream of trucks was delivering waste, and waste-pickers quickly
searched for items to salvage or recyclable. That done, machines compacted the waste and
covered it with soil. Leachate was drained by gravity from the site to a lower-level treatment
plant, whose outflow was clear and inodorous. Methane gas was collected and burnt off as
                                           17


required. The only facet of modern solid waste management missing was separation and
recycling—but this was done in an ad hoc fashion by the waste pickers.

FINANCIALLY VIABLE SANITATION/DRAINAGE COMPANIES

2.32 Efficacy rating: Modest. Through conferring greater responsibilities upon them in
executing the project, there is some evidence that the project helped local sanitation and
drainage utilities (URENCOs/SADCO) take the first steps toward the autonomous and more
financially viable operations intended by the government. Profitability, the immediate project
goal, is still a long way off, though. The project‘s main path toward it, via direct cost
recovery through user charges, still cannot be followed, with the government capping the
maximum charge allowable at very low levels.10 The project provided technical assistance to
encourage change at the national level, but without much progress. On the other hand, project
technical assistance helped the utilities assume their autonomous juridical personality.
Furthermore, hands-on project experience enabled the utilities in all cities to build up
relatively autonomous operations, managing their own operating budgets. Although short of
the original project aim of financial viability, this was an important step in itself. Prior to the
project they had been merely dependent departments of central government ministries. They
have built up their own staff of young engineers bringing technical expertise not available to
them before, and of great use to Vietnam as it seeks solutions to the challenging sanitation
and drainage problems of its cities. In Halong City, for instance, IEG learned that some ten
city engineers had visited sanitation utilities of other cities providing them with advice and
technical assistance. MPI officials in Hanoi confirmed that the receiving utilities had
benefited from this support. Indeed, building up these cadres was one of the most significant
institutional results of the project.

2.33 Despite their increased autonomy, sanitation utilities are still dependent upon
government subsidies to finance their investments and even some of their operations without
the independent source of funding through user fees that was hoped for. The funding for this
project itself was a subsidy, being transferred to the utilities as a grant, with government
servicing the IDA Credit. The sanitation utilities set their own wastewater tariffs, but
currently within a very low ceiling set by government of 15 percent of the water tariff.
Central government, concerned about containing inflation, is reluctant to allow increases in
the short-run. Because of these structural constraints, direct cost recovery accounted for
about half of operating costs, therefore falling short of its target of fully meeting these costs.

2.34 Project appraisal had an ingenious idea of ―twinning‖ a project city‘s sanitation utility
with a more established counterpart agency in another country, one with whom its
Vietnamese ―twin‖ could share experiences and receive technical advice as needed. Lack of
interest by external partner utilities meant that the scheme did not take off, leaving the project
utilities to rely upon more traditional forms of technical assistance through consulting
services and training11.

2.35 Although it may not have helped the sanitation utilities themselves directly, IEG
learned that their greater involvement in the sector involving different government ministries

  At appraisal, only Danang City was forecast to be in profit by project closing (PAD p. 50), something that it
has yet to achieve.

     The Region notes that language barriers also limited the effectiveness of twinning.

might have contributed to improving inter-ministerial coordination in Hanoi—an unintended
but worthwhile result.

EVIDENCE OF HIGHER-ORDER RESULTS?

2.36 Although not explicitly taken into accounted in the project performance ratings, IEG
did look for evidence of project impacts upon public health and economic development—the
higher-order objectives of this operation, according to the PAD.

2.37 Public health improvements: Provincial level data provided to IEG by the Ministry
of Health show sharper falls in water-borne diseases over the 1999-2009 project period
where the project cities are located than in Vietnam as a whole. (Table 2-1). Dysentery, a
bacterial infection of the intestine transmitted by untreated urban sewage stagnating in public
spaces where children play, was practically eliminated from the three project provinces,
although trace cases do remain that do not show up in the per-10,000 people indicator. More
common diarrhea, often but not exclusively caused by viral infections of the small intestine
derived, again, from poor sanitation, fell more rapidly in all three provinces than the national
average.12 Danang‘s performance is particularly notable; having recovered from being 20
percent worse than the national average before the project, to becoming 14 percent better
after the project. This was bolstered perhaps by its greater investments than the other cities in
solid waste collection and disposal that contributes to the same public health dynamic by
helping to prevent blocked drains that cause polluted wastewater to back up creating a health
hazard. Thus the project‘s contribution came principally from curbing some of the standing
and free flow of untreated sewage through the urban areas. At the same time, however, it
must be recognized that other non-project factors are at play in obtaining the results reported.
In particular, the (provincial) results include rural areas over which the project had no
influence. Also local community health campaigns, that were not included in this project, can
contribute to these results.




12
   The provinces‘ falls in the 38-45 percent range were significantly higher than the 10-20 percent fall targeted
at appraisal (PAD p. 37). The figures cited here refer the provinces as a whole, so that some of the
improvements, the lower incidence of diarrhea, for example, may accrue to rural areas too. With that in mind,
IEG inquired of significant health programs in the rural areas of these three provinces during 1998-2009, but
learned of none likely to have a significant impact upon the results reported in Table 2-1.

2.38 Increased economic development: As already noted, the project choice of tourism
indicators for its cost benefit analysis was not a good measure of the operation‘s contribution
to cities‘ economic development. It is unlikely that greater tourist numbers and spending
would result from urban sanitation and environmental improvements alone, especially so in a
city without a tourism vocation, such as Haiphong. It is possible that improved sanitation and
drainage, as part of a city‘s economic infrastructure, could make an urban area a more
attractive and less costly location for new productive enterprises and for their workers to find
a more livable urban environment. But IEG did not find convincing evidence that the
economic development performance of the project‘s participating cities had been
significantly better than others. Such evidence would need to demonstrate two things: that the
economic performance of one or more of these cities was significantly better than other
cities, and that the gain was not zero-sum, in other words being simply at the expense of
another losing city.

2.39 Without acknowledging that it is a performance indicator with weak linkages to the
project, the implementation completion report (ICR) does inform about tourism growth in the
project areas during project implementation. It reports 113 percent growth in tourist arrivals
in Quang Ninh (home to Halong Bay, Vietnam‘s top tourist destination receiving 3.6 million
visitor per annum), and 69 percent in Danang City over the 2002-2006 period (ICR p. 10).
During project implementation Vietnam‘s tourism, measured by foreign visitor arrivals
nationwide indeed grew rapidly (Figure 7).

2.40 Likely causes of these increases are unrelated to the project, however. They might
include: (i) a devalued local currency since 2004; (ii) tourism campaigns on behalf of
Vietnam, especially in Europe; (iii) better tourist infrastructure (hotels, resorts, cruise boats);
and (iv) more direct flights from Europe. Tourism can also be hit negatively by factors
exogenous to the sector, such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
in 2003 and avian flu in 2009. None has anything to do with sanitation improvements of the
type brought by the project under review, of course. Indeed, there are many cases worldwide
where enclave tourist resorts with first rate services of their own thrive when isolated from
the degraded parts of poorly served local cities that the tourists never see.

Efficiency
2.41 Efficiency rating: Substantial. Cost savings from competitive bidding using local
contractors (in addition to appreciation of the SDR in relation to the dollar) allowed the
project to expand the scale of investments, improving the cost-effectiveness of the results
relative to appraisal estimates. The project extensions were primarily due to the need to
complete these additional investments. Minor shortcomings were that actual operating and
maintenance costs were much higher than those estimated at appraisal – maybe due to
inaccurate initial estimates rather than actual over-runs for what are high-cost operations that
depend a lot on pumping.

2.42 The cost-benefit analyses at appraisal and project closing estimated economic rates of
return of around 15 percent, but these depended on the assumption that tourism would
increase as a result of the project investments – accounting for half of the project benefits. It
is doubtful that improved sanitation by itself would be sufficient to bring in more tourists and
tourist spending. More appropriate measures would have tried to capture higher real estate
                                              22


values representing a stronger demand for an improved urban environment and increased
business activity due to project investments.

Ratings
OUTCOME

Overall rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

2.43 There were moderate shortcomings in the project‘s efficient achievement of its
objectives. Sanitation infrastructure was substantially improved through the introduction of
primary and secondary sewage treatment and solid waste management on a significant scale
for the first time in more than half a century. Introducing proper solid waste management for
the first time in Danang was one of the strongest results of the operation. Moderate
shortcomings arise, however, from the lack of systematic and convincing evidence that
pollution and flooding were reduced. Anecdotal commentaries in this regard were mixed.
The financial viability of sanitation and drainage companies sought by the project remains to
be achieved with user charges still capped at very low levels. Lack of M&E and systematic
performance data prevented a clearer perception of all project results. Without baseline data,
we cannot affirm with confidence by exactly how much today‘s conditions are different
from those encountered before the project. M&E capacity can be expected to develop in the
future, however, aided by the new cadres of qualified young engineers that the project helped
form.

RISK TO DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME

Rating: Significant.

2.44 The government, the cities and the Bank have all demonstrated ongoing commitments
to Vietnam‘s sanitation and drainage sector and its reform. The country now has stronger
local teams to deal with the many sector issues that will, no doubt, continue to arise in the
future. On the other hand, shortcomings in cost recovery, observed in all project cities, do
raise the risk to development outcome. Local sanitation utilities still have limited scope in
setting tariffs that an inflation tackling central government is reluctant to increase. Another
risk comes from households‘ demonstrated reluctance to connect their septic tanks to nearby
sewage lines (where these exist), when they perceive their septic tank solution to be adequate
enough. Also, continuing difficulties of access to on-site septic tanks for cleaning and
emptying may put project benefits at risk in the future. Finally, the challenging sea level,
flood-prone sites of these cities means that bigger sanitation and drainage solutions will
require more and more expensive pumping solutions, only sustainable if increasing resources
are available for the open-ended funding needed.

BANK PERFORMANCE

Overall rating: Moderately Satisfactory

2.45 Quality at Entry is rated moderately satisfactory: The project design, combining
incremental priority investments in urban sanitation and drainage infrastructure with
                                              23


institutional strengthening of local agencies, was appropriate for the urban and sector policy
conditions prevailing at the time of appraisal in 1999. The financial analysis of the sector and
its agencies in the cities was thorough and pointed to the need for sectoral reforms—now
actively under discussion through the ESW reviewed in the next chapter. Basing the project
on the same cities that participated in the earlier Water Supply Project (Cr N0260), took good
advantage of engaging the few urban authorities with this kind of experience in Vietnam. The
project design was well targeted in its focus upon public health, always at risk with poor
sanitation. The same cannot be said for the project design‘s link to urban economic
development through tourism. Poor design of M&E undermined quality at entry by pursuing
results that had little to do with the project—tourism, for instance—or for requiring the use of
strong local monitoring frameworks that did not exist—such as for flooding and pollution.
This was a surprising failure given that the Bank had worked with these cities before through
the water project and should therefore have known the cities‘ strengths and weaknesses in
this regard.

2.46 Quality of Supervision rated moderately satisfactory: Continuity within the IDA
team and co-financiers, mostly based in Hanoi, benefited project execution. Continuity
ensured timely attention to implementation challenges as they arose. Supervision missions
raised issues of concern with counterparts, notably the lack of attention to cost recovery and
the slow processing of procurement. At the same time, however, supervision could have paid
more attention to retrofitting project M&E. Missions considered revising and better aligning
projects objective to more measureable outcomes, but pragmatically stayed with the original
imperfect set to avoid the inevitable protracted government processing that a revision of
project objectives would have required. This allowed supervision to focus upon
implementation, resulting in a generally satisfactory delivery of the engineering output.

BORROWER PERFORMANCE

Overall rating: Moderately Satisfactory.

2.47 Government Performance rated moderately satisfactory. The government‘s strong
commitment to the project is demonstrated by the timely provision of counterpart funds that,
by completion, were 40 percent more in Vietnamese dong than promised at appraisal, or 25
percent more than expected in US dollar terms. On the other hand, processing of approvals of
cities‘ procurement, disbursement, and revised component designs, could have been more
agile to lessen the implementation delays that arose. The government did not adjust
wastewater tariff ceilings enough to allow the direct cost recovery intended by the project.

2.48 Implementing Agency Performance rated moderately satisfactory. The performance
of Danang City's URENCO and Haiphong City's SADCO was fully satisfactory during
implementation. They adapted to the requirements of Bank project implementation. In Quang
Ninh, the project experienced greater delays due to poor capacity of some contractors, and
delays in site clearance by the local agencies whose performance was moderately
satisfactory. Delays were compounded by slow and repetitive reviews by local agencies—
even before they were sent for central government‘s own protracted approvals—contributing
to the project closing three years behind schedule.

Lessons of the Investment Project
•   While good project design makes the links between project interventions and outcomes
    explicit through a results-chain, the rationale for attribution should have a sound
    theoretical foundation and appropriate performance indicators should be identified. Urban
    infrastructure investments in sanitation and drainage such as this project‘s can produce
    outputs that contribute to generalized project objectives such as reduced environmental
    pollution and flooding, but the links can be complex and difficult to monitor.
    Achievements can only be accurately measured when baselines are clear and data is
    current on all relevant performance indicators.
•   The project showed that urban households were satisfied with the septic tanks provided,
    regarding them as adequate final solutions to their sanitation needs, making connections
    to local sewer networks appear unnecessary to these households. As Vietnam continues
    to urbanize rapidly, sector specialists will need to monitor how well the household septic
    tank solution continues to perform with increasing urban densities. At the same time, the
    specialists would need to identify the incentives that households might need to eventually
    move to systemic solutions for urban sanitation.
•   In low-lying coastal and riverine cities vulnerable to floods, natural disasters and
    environmental pollution, as are most of Vietnam‘s, investment and O&M of urban
    infrastructure can be very expensive. Financing must be assured, usually government
    funding for investment and cost recovery from users for part of O&M.


3. Economic and Sector Work: Sanitation Management
for Urban Areas
Background and Summary
IEG’S PILOT ASSESSMENTS OF ANALYTIC WORK

3.1    IEG‘s review here of the economic and sector work (ESW) entitled Sanitation
Management for Urban Areas is a pilot effort that aims to help establish methods and
approaches to the evaluation of examples of the important body of Bank analytic work.

3.2     Evaluating analytic work is a challenging task for five reasons. Firstly, the Bank still
has no generally agreed results framework for analytic and advisory activities (AAA), which
include ESW and non-lending technical assistance. Secondly, the intended results of
particular analytic and advisory products are rarely clearly articulated. Thirdly, the Bank has
no process, thus far, of self-evaluation of analytic and advisory work, equivalent to
completion reports for projects (ICRs) and for country assistance strategies (CAS completion
reports). Fourthly, analytic and advisory products can take many different forms—ESW (as
in the example reviewed here), technical assistance, donor and aid coordination, research
services, and the World Development Report—each with disparate reporting needs and
requirements. Fifthly, even though each piece of analytic and advisory work will have
particular clients in mind—central government, municipalities, professional associations,
                                                   25


civil society—these are rarely articulated, making the identification of the client a major
evaluation task.

3.3    At this pilot stage of its evaluation of analytic and advisory activities, IEG assesses
four dimensions of performance of the particular work under review:

     1. Results – the extent to which there is: (i) impact on government programs and/or the
        broader development dialogue in the country; and (ii) impact on the design of the
        Bank‘s program and/or the subsequent CAS.
     2. Strategic relevance and ownership – the extent to which: (i) the activity addresses a
        key development constraint and is coherent with the country assistance program; (ii)
        it is delivered at the right time in relation to key decisions; and (iii) there is evidence
        of strong interest by government, development partners, or civil society and/or
        evidence of active engagement of government agencies or local institutions in
        conducting the work.
     3. Quality – the extent to which there is: (i) use of appropriate knowledge and analytic
        techniques; (ii) analysis of existing and/or new local data; (iii) effective use of cross-
        country comparisons and global experiences; (iv) evidence of clear understanding of
        local institutions and context; (v) a set of clear and actionable recommendations; and
        (vi) adequate peer review and client feedback.
     4. Dissemination and sustained dialogue – the extent to which there is: (i) evidence of
        appropriate dissemination; (ii) evidence that the report reaches effectively the right
        audiences through appropriate targeted distribution and events; and (iii) evidence of
        sustained engagement.
IEG‘s assessment of each dimension is presented in turn in this chapter and summarized in
the form of a template in Annex B of this report.

ORIGINS OF THIS STUDY

3.4      As part of the Bank‘s analytical and advisory work13 in Vietnam, the study reviewed
here is a direct product of questions raised by earlier World Bank investment project
assistance to Vietnam‘s water and sanitation sectors (Box 2). The 1997-2004 Vietnam Water
Supply Project and the 1999-2008 Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project highlighted the
enormous scale of the sanitation and drainage challenges facing the cities that participated in
both operations, namely Haiphong City, Danang City, Halong City and Cam Pha City. These
cities‘ problems seemed common to those of other urban centers throughout the country.
Confined to their selected locations, the projects were not designed to determine challenges
at the national scale, or even at the citywide level of each municipal client. They also did not
review the technical performance of existing solutions or propose experimenting with
different ones. The project experience did raise questions, however, about the technical,

  According to the Bank‘s OPCS, Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) or ―Triple A‖ is an umbrella
category of work that embraces several product lines designed for the Bank‘s external clients. Examples of
AAA include Economic and Sector Work (ESW), Technical Assistance (Non-Lending), (TA), Donor and Aid
Coordination (DA), Research Services (RF), and the World Development Report (WD).

financial and institutional feasibility of tackling the overall problems of urban sanitation and
drainage in Vietnam. The economic and sector work (ESW) entitled Sanitation Management
for Urban Areas reviewed here was designed to answer such questions.

3.5     The early stages of designing and preparing the ESW started as the Three Cities
project was winding down in 2008. At that time, the ESW was to focus mostly upon the
technical challenges of sanitation infrastructure in Vietnam‘s cities, with a view to offering
specific technical solutions for local authorities to consider using. An initial idea was to
prepare a technical handbook to guide municipal engineers on good practice standards for
on-site septic tanks in particular. Discussions among Bank staff and management about the
                                               27


sector-wide issues behind such practices, however, led to the decision to broaden the scope of
the ESW beyond technical matters alone. The ESW was then to embrace the policy and
strategic questions confronting Vietnam so that it could help address the urban sanitation and
drainage mega-challenges of all the country‘s cities. In the words of one Bank staffer, the
ESW would provide a bird‘s eye view of this major issue and a strategic vision for tackling
it. Technical solutions would still be addressed by the work, but given a more supporting role
to help draw more attention to developing the broader sector strategy first.

3.6     On the government side, MPI and MOC were the initial stakeholders of the ESW.
Their officials told the IEG mission how they had conveyed to the Bank interests expressed
by local city authorities for more advisory work, of the ESW kind to help them plan and
design their own responses to the sanitation and drainage challenges. The Vietnamese
Association of Sanitation Utilities—mostly city-level agencies—was behind the formal
request to launch this work.

OBJECTIVES AND CONTENT

3.7    The design of this work included the explicit formulation of an objective in two parts:

       ―To provide policy makers with: (a) a baseline assessment of sanitation services in
       urban centers, including technical, financial and institutional issues; and (b)
       suggestions on best practices for on-site sanitation that would not pose a risk to
       human health and protect the environment.‖ (ESW Concept Note para 9).

3.8      Both parts of the objective were highly relevant to central government and to Bank
priorities for the sector in Vietnam. The Bank‘s ESW team told IEG that, in pursuing these
objectives, the work should raise ESW clients‘ awareness of the need to develop a more
complete understanding of where the urban sanitation sector in Vietnam stands today, and of
the environmentally and public health friendly solutions available to help solves its problems.

3.9     The first part of the formal objective, the provision of a baseline of sanitation and
drainage infrastructure and services in Vietnam‘s cities is a necessary input into sector
policymaking and strategy formulation. IEG‘s own review of the associated Vietnam: Three
Cities Sanitation Project found a weak baseline to be a major shortcoming of that operation.

3.10 The second part, providing suggestions for best practice for on-site sanitation
appropriately, had septic tanks in mind. These are the most common sanitation solution in
Vietnam‘s cities, used by 76 percent of all urban households. Although the objective does not
explicitly affirm this, by calling for (new) suggestions, it is implying that these best practice
solutions will be different from those currently in use. IEG saw septic tank solutions financed
by the Three Cities Sanitation Project reproduce shortcomings that had been criticized at its
appraisal, particularly through being inaccessible and impossible to clean and service. With
technical uncertainties like these, the ESW objective could well have been extended to cover
an assessment of the technical efficiency of present and proposed solutions, even guiding
further research to develop solutions not yet on the table. It could even have led to clear
advice about whether to proceed with building sewerage networks or not.

IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS

3.11 The ESW was fully funded by AusAID, and directly contracted by the Bank. These
parties, together with the government, had considered delegating full responsibility for the
work to government departments, given the strong support it had in Hanoi. But, doing so
would have required lengthy reviews and formal approvals by the Prime Minister‘s office
and others, as if it were a completely new stand-alone investment project. So this approach
was dropped.

3.12 The Bank approved the concept note for the ESW in February 2009. Following the
objectives, it divided the work into two areas: (i) measuring Vietnam‘s urban sanitation
baseline, and (ii) proposing best practice technical solutions for on-site sanitation. After an
international call for proposals, pre-qualification and short-listing, one French and one
Danish firm were selected to do the work. They began the study in April 2009, aiming to
complete it thirteen months later in May 2010. Actual delivery is about one year behind
schedule mainly because it took longer to obtain a precise picture of the financial resources
needed for such a large and sensitive reform.

3.13 With a draft report prepared and distributed among the 41 high level participants, the
Bank and the ESW team launched a workshop in Hanoi in August 2010 to discuss the
findings of the preliminary draft. The participants were from the client groups mentioned
above (para. 3.4). With their feedback, the ESW team updated the draft and refined some
baseline data, producing a full draft in December 2010, the summary of which will be
presented to the government in May 2011.

COSTS AND FINANCING

3.14 The initial budget for this job was US$210,000, fully funded by AusAID. This
covered all costs except for Bank staff time, estimated to be about US$25,000. At this
writing, actual spending has been US$210,000. There were no direct government
contributions to fund this work. Clearly the government did incur costs in participating in this
work, notably the August 2010 Workshop, but IEG found these costs absorbed into the
general budget and not been separately accounted for.

CLIENTS

3.15 The formal client for this work is Vietnam‘s Ministry of Construction that will
receive the final report on behalf of the government. In addition, there are four other clients
that need to be considered by this evaluation. Since each client‘s expectations of the ESW
were different, each client may have also different views about its effectiveness and success.
For this assessment, IEG identified the following four clients:

       Ministry of Planning and Investment, the central government department responsible
       for proposing the budget needed for investment in Vietnam‘s sanitation sector
       recommended by the ESW.

      Vietnam‘s ―community of practice‖ in the urban sanitation and drainage sector made
       up of sanitary and hydraulic engineers, from national and city government, private
                                                29


       firms and academia, who will help design, review, approve, build and operate the
       huge sanitation and drainage improvements needed in the coming years.

      International parties to the ongoing sector dialogue in Vietnam, consisting mainly
       engineers from global contractors and consultants who work on Vietnam.

      Finally, the sponsors of the ESW itself, namely AusAID and the World Bank.



Results
3.16 Achieving objective (a): providing a baseline assessment of urban sanitation
services: The ESW provided a baseline, as intended, whose value was in assembling data in
one place for the first time, and modeling future development scenarios from it, even if most
of the data was already known. The ESW made clear that Vietnam‘s urban sanitation
baseline included rapid urban growth, 75 percent of the urban population depending upon
septic tank solutions for there sanitation, while treatment of wastewater is still only a fraction
of the total produced. The government has already programmed investments of US$10.8
billion in sanitation during 2010-2025, while the wastewater tariffs at their present levels
would raise US$400 million per year to cover operation and maintenance.

3.17 Achieving objective (a): providing suggestions on best practices for on-site
sanitation: ESW work to support this objective produced less substantial results than in
achieving the study‘s baseline objective. There were two main reasons for this. Firstly, the
uncertainty about the technical effectiveness of on-site septic tanks. Secondly, close ESW
attention to technical solutions intended at the outset gave way to increased focus upon the
baseline and broad national strategies for moving ahead from it. At completion, therefore, it
provided little guidance on which technical solutions to apply and how best to use them.

3.18 The impact upon government programs and sector dialogue: Particularly at the
national level, the study helped raise sector stakeholders‘ awareness of the challenges posed
by the precarious baseline or urban sanitation infrastructure and services in the country. In
the same way, the donor community active in this sector in Vietnam has been made more
aware of the scale of the sector needs, something that has yet to be manifested in their
assistance programs, however. The study, even though completed very recently, has had
some influence in changing institutions, particularly in the merger of local water and
sanitation in three provinces, as proposed. IEG found no evidence of new legislation or
regulations in place as a result of the study. They are not needed, as Vietnam already has the
necessary legal framework. A sector strategy and programmatic investment have still to be
finalized. It is still too early to tell whether the study has built a coalition for change. That
will depend upon the stakeholders‘ reactions, some of which are yet to be manifested, to the
study‘s recommendation. The final report was delivered to the government (MOC) in mid-
2011, but there has been no official response to it as of this writing.

3.19 The sector dialogue in Vietnam was considerably enhanced through the August 2010
workshop to discuss the preliminary findings (details in dissemination and sustained dialogue
                                              30


section of this chapter). In hindsight, it appears that workshop of this kind has been more
effective in eliciting government responses than the formal delivery of the final version of a
report with which officials were familiar in its earlier draft forms.

3.20 AAA results in the Bank: While it is still early to note the effects of this study on
Bank assistance through its country programs in Vietnam or elsewhere, IEG learned that it
brought the sanitation sector to the forefront of a public expenditure review for Vietnam that
the Bank is currently preparing. On the other hand, IEG found no evidence yet of the use of
its findings in the design of new lending products, or developing Bank strategies or future
knowledge products. But some time will to elapse before such products incorporating these
findings can be prepared. Finally, for a borrower like Vietnam, which has a strong preference
for investment lending, IEG could detect no effect of the study on policy lending in the
country.

3.21 Results rating: Satisfactory. The study had a substantial impact on the sector
dialogue in the country particularly through August 2010. It can be expected to have impacts
on government programs too, but these effects still need more time to work themselves
through. The study also had a substantial impact upon Bank assistance to the sanitation
sectors in Vietnam, both through additional investment lending and through a follow-on
study that will focus more upon the technical issues facing the sector and technical
recommendations about the kind of solutions to be adopted. Achieving its own objectives—
unusually explicit for this particular product—is not factored into the results rating of this
assessment, but they deserve comment here. The study was successful in providing the
promised baseline, although it fell somewhat short in providing best practice solutions for on-
site sanitation, not least vis à vis the expectations of stakeholders interviewed by IEG. The
follow-on study is expected to make up for this shortcoming.


Strategic Relevance and Ownership
3.22 Addressing a key development constraint, consistent with the CAS: The study was
consistent with relevant to country partnership strategy (CPS) priorities in two important
respects: (i) improving access of the poor to sanitation as a top priority (World Bank 2007 p.
33), and (ii) improving the quality of the services themselves, such as sewage collection and
treatment, for stronger environmental protection and public health improvements. The
current 2007-2011 CPS for Vietnam, for instance, not only recognizes the importance of
using AAA as a tool for helping improve urban sanitation as a whole. It goes further, linking
better access to sanitation to poverty reduction:

    ―The remaining poor groups are disproportionately affected by pollution, notably water
   pollution. The poor have substantially less access to clean water and sanitation. Over the
   last 10 years, service delivery of clean water and sanitation to the poorest groups has
   grown at a much lower rate compared to non-poor groups‖ (World Bank 2007 p. 7).

3.23 Later, the CPS highlighted the importance of curtailing the environmental
externalities from poor sanitation:
                                               31


   ―improved environmental policies and a more systematic use of enforceable
   environmental standards are called for. The standards need to focus on reducing
   environmental degradation through better waste management and reduced air and water
   pollution within each sector‖ (World Bank 2007 p. 10).

3.24 Timely delivery: The report was very timely in that it was prepared as the government
was designing a major investment program in the sanitation, thereby helping better inform
the government of the baseline constraints facing the sector. The delivery of the study
coincided with the acceleration of program implementation scheduled to run to 2025.

3.25 Evidence of strong local interest and engagement in the study: With its shift from
seeking specific technical solutions to addressing broader sectoral issues, the study became,
and remains, substantially relevant to the debate about how best to help lift the country‘s
cities above their deficient sanitation baselines. Both government and the Bank now accept
that the scope and scale of inadequate sanitation and drainage in Vietnam‘s cities poses one
of the country‘s greatest development and public health challenges. The ESW played a role
in raising that awareness. From its contacts with clients of the study in Vietnam, the IEG
mission found that those at the national level recognized its relevance most clearly,
appropriately so, as it is from this level that the solutions must be strategized. At the local
level, where clients were fully engaged in the day-to-day sanitation challenges of their cities,
there was less interest in the national strategic relevance of the work.

3.26 IEG noted that ownership of the study was strong at the level of central government
in Hanoi, even though it was not initially requested or commissioned by the government. A
large number of government officials attended the August 2010 workshop and continue to
monitoring progress with this work. During its visit to Vietnam, IEG did not detect active
local champions of the work, however. Past experience has shown that strong country
ownership of development initiatives, preferably through high-level interlocutors to
champion them, will produce best results. As already noted, ownership at local levels was
weaker among officials and experts with pressing day-to-day concerns, some of whom were
not even aware that the work existed. This points to the need for more intense dissemination
at these levels.

3.27 During the August 2010 workshop, clients provided feedback to help the consultants
update an earlier draft of the report. The minutes of the workshop, published as an annex of
the final report, documents the ensuing discussions very well.

3.28 Strategic relevance and ownership rating: Satisfactory. The study focused upon one
of the country‘s principal development constraints, widely recognized as such in Vietnam
and by the Bank. It was very timely, prepared as the government was designing a major
investment program in the sector, and delivered as that program gathered speed.
Furthermore, there is evidence of strong local ownership and engagement that peaked at the
time of the August 201 workshop in Hanoi.

Quality
3.29 Use of appropriate knowledge and analytic techniques: The Bank has had a half-
century of worldwide experience of supporting sanitation improvement in cities and was thus
be well positioned to provide the high quality professional and technical advice that
Vietnam‘s sought and continues to seek for this sector. Several senior Bank experts from the
sanitation sector worked on the report. The final April 2011 report was sent to the
government on May 18, 2011 in two versions, the complete report with 60 pages of text and
46 pages of annexes, and a synthesis report of 23 pages. Overall, the reporting is well-
balanced and succinct across the technical, financial and institutional issues affecting the
sector in Vietnam. It clearly presents the key features of the sanitation baseline. About half
the main text of the complete report was devoted to the technical aspects of the country‘s
baseline, while the other half concentrated on the financial and institutional sides. The 46
pages of annexes, that include the consultant‘s presentation to the August 2010 workshop in
Hanoi, document well how the work was done, but are short on empirical data pertaining to
the baseline conditions.

3.30 Analysis of existing and/or new local data: The study launched its own survey to
collect primary data from 105 households in Ho Chi Minh City, Can Tho, and Quang Ngai to
find out what kind of sanitation services they had and what they wanted. It is not clear how
this seemingly very small sample was selected, or how the survey itself was conducted. The
study nevertheless reports various percentages of the total households with this or that
service or problem from the survey, as if these findings had general validity for the
population as a whole. This could only be the case if the sample had been randomly selected
from the general population—something that the report does not claim. For detailed national
and provincial level sanitation data, the ESW chose to model its own statistics, a sensible
approach given the limited availability of empirical data on this sector in Vietnam.

3.31 Effective use of cross-country comparisons and global experience: The reports
made very few explicit references to the drainage and sanitation experiences of other
countries. But this should not be seen as a shortcoming of the work. Vietnam‘s urban
sanitation (and drainage) challenges are very specific to the conditions of the country‘s cities,
maybe unique in at least two respects, their low-lying coastal sites make sanitation and
drainage operations costly, and no major city has purpose-built sewerage collection network.

3.32 Evidence of clear understanding of local institutions and context: The specific
approach to Vietnam was well served by this study, which carried out a thorough analysis of
the institutional arrangements for the sector in the country. Local insights were facilitated by
the strong representation of Vietnamese experts on the study team—a requirement for
interested firms to be shortlisted.

3.33 Clear and actionable recommendations: The report included 14 quite specific
recommendations on the technical, financing and institutional aspects of sanitation in
Vietnam (Box 2). To adopt most of these recommendations, a set of actions clearly follow,
such as the recommendation requiring that all septic tanks be connected to a sewer. Thus far,
however, there has not been a formal acceptance (or rejection) of the report‘s
recommendations by the authorities in Vietnam.
                                               33


3.34 Subjected to adequate peer review and client feedback: According the Bank‘s task
team supervising this work, peer review of successive drafts of the report was conducted by
high level sector experts. Bank management, too, gave it close attention and feedback to
improve its quality. In fact, it was the management review of a near-final draft report that led
to the idea of preparing a special summary version tailored specifically to the needs of the
government.

3.35 Quality rating: Satisfactory. The report successfully deployed existing sector
knowledge that was well-founded in the Bank, it dealt pragmatically with constraints upon
good empirical sector data in Vietnam, it had a good understanding of local conditions thanks
to Vietnamese and Vietnam-experienced team members, and with peer review led to
practical recommendations to guide the sector.



Dissemination and Sustained Dialogue
3.36 Evidence of appropriate dissemination: The final report was formally sent on May
18, 2011 to the Vice-Minister of MOC, Vietnam‘s principal government authority for
sanitation, and the Bank ‗s main partner in this sector. Effective dissemination of the work
occurred earlier, however, through the August 2010 workshop in Hanoi launched to discuss
the then preliminary findings. Thus far, the report has only been produced in English in two
versions both dated April 2011: (i) the complete report with 60 pages of text and 46 pages of
annexes that include the presentation made by the consultants at the August 2010 workshop;
and (ii) a synthesis report of 23 pages. Consideration was given to preparing a Vietnamese
language version of the report and summary brochures, but budget constraints have thus far
prevented this.

3.37 Report reaches effectively the right audiences through appropriate targeted
distribution and events: The August 2010 workshop was well attended by 47 high-level
participants representing central and local government and technical institutes, as well as
international experts. The government delegation was led by the Vice Minister of MOC. The
Workshop brought important feedback to the study. This feedback was well documented
over six pages in an annex of the final report. On the technical side, the dissemination of the
study‘s initial findings stimulated much discussion among participants about the technical
performance of septic tanks and sowed the seed for looking more closely at alternative
solutions in the future. Participants urged that the study should clarify whether septic tanks
are a good or bad option – an issue addressed in the final version of the report. The fact that
such questions could arise in a meeting of sanitation experts in Vietnam indicates that the
report was dealing with topics of considerable interest (and concern) to the audience

3.38 Evidence of sustained engagement: At this writing, the report has been with
government for a relatively short period and thus far, it has not generated an explicit response
from the government to its findings and its recommendations.

3.39 Dissemination and sustained dialogue rating: Satisfactory. Particularly through the
August 2010 workshop in Hanoi, the report was successfully disseminated among key sector
                                              34


stakeholders, stimulating important discussions among them. Several workshop participants
provided feedback on the report‘s findings and recommendations, helping their final
formulations.



Lessons
      Dissemination and dialogue among stakeholders can be more intense and effective
       during discussions of preliminary findings and recommendations than after the
       submission of a report in its final version at the completion of the task, as the 2010
       workshop in Hanoi demonstrated in this case.

      A focus upon a baseline is a good and timely start for analytic work of this kind,
       when government is about to make major decisions affecting a particular sector. As
       far as possible the analysis of a baseline should be founded upon existing empirical
       data. Where such data is not available, modeling some aspects of the baseline may
       become unavoidable. When this happens, government and local authorities need to be
       alerted about the lack of data, and offered recommendations about how to remedy it.

      To help government sectoral policymaking and strategizing for sanitation when views
       differ on how to proceed, ESW should provide definitive conclusions and clear
       recommendations—that could be in the form of different scenarios—and not raise
       further doubts and more questions as this study did regarding the technical
       performance of septic tanks.

      The ―polluter pays‖ principle points to the need to energize cost recovery from
       residential, commercial and industrial producers of wastewater in cities, to pay at
       least some sanitation operation and maintenance. Recovering costs from existing
       beneficiaries to pay for expensive urban sanitation investments for the future are
       unlikely to succeed, especially when government has traditionally paid the bill in
       Vietnam as in most developing and developed countries.

                                                            Background
As part of the Bank’s analytical and advisory work (AAA) in Vietnam, the ESW reviewed here is a direct product of questions raised by
earlier World Bank investment project assistance to Vietnam’s water and sanitation sectors (Box 2). The 1997-2004 Vietnam Water
Supply Project and the 1999-2008 Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project highlighted the enormous scale of the sanitation and
drainage challenges facing the cities that participated in both operations, namely Haiphong City, Danang City, Halong City and Cam
Pha City. These cities’ problems seemed common to those of other urban centers throughout the country. Confined to their selected
locations, the projects were not designed to determine challenges at the national scale, or even at the citywide level of each municipal
client. They also did not review the technical performance of existing solutions or propose experimenting with different ones. The
project experience did raise questions, however, about the technical, financial and institutional feasibility of tackling the overall problems
of urban sanitation and drainage in Vietnam. The economic and sector work (ESW) entitled Sanitation Management for Urban Areas
reviewed here was designed to answer such questions

                                                      Overall Assessment
The ESW report focuses upon a top priority issue for Vietnam’s sustained development, namely addressing urban sanitation and
environmental issues in cities that lack the necessary infrastructure and services and which are vulnerable to natural disasters and the
effects of climate change. It was very timely for addressing these issues as Vietnam embarks on a massive investment program to
introduce these services to its burgeoning cities. It disseminated its preliminary findings and recommendations effectively through a
successful workshop in Hanoi attended by key stakeholders. Overall, the ESW was satisfactory across all four dimensions of IEG’s
assessment, namely Results, Strategic Relevance and Ownership, Quality and Dissemination/Sustained Dialogue (details below)


                                                                Lessons
    Dissemination and dialogue among stakeholders can be more intense and effective during discussions of preliminary findings and
     recommendations than after the submission of a report in its final version at the completion of the ESW task, as the 2010
     workshop in Hanoi demonstrated in this case.

    A focus upon a baseline is a good and timely start for ESW work of this kind, when government is about to make major decisions
     affecting a particular sector. As far as possible the analysis of a baseline should be founded upon existing empirical data. Where
     such data is not available, modeling some aspects of the baseline may become unavoidable. When this happens, government
     and local authorities need to be alerted about the lack of data, and offered recommendations about how to remedy it.

    To help government sectoral policymaking and strategizing for sanitation when views differ on how to proceed, ESW should
     provide definitive conclusions and clear recommendations—that could be in the form of different scenarios—and not raise further
     doubts and more questions as this ESW did regarding the technical performance of septic tanks.

    The ―polluter pays‖ principle points to the need to energize cost recovery from residential, commercial and industrial producers of
     wastewater in cities, to pay at least some sanitation O&M. Recovering costs from existing beneficiaries to pay for expensive urban
     sanitation investments for the future are unlikely to succeed, especially when government has traditionally paid the bill in Vietnam
     as in most developing and developed countries.


                                                      Summary of Results
Did the product have…
 …clearly defined results objectives defined at       Yes: Two objectives: (i) to provide a baseline assessment of urban sanitation
inception?                                            services in Vietnam (i.e. a starting point for new policy and approach); (ii) to provide
                                                      suggestions for best practice technical solutions.
 …clearly defined indicators defined at               Partially: The ESW specified that the baseline would be quantified in terms of the
inception?                                            technical, financial and institutional aspects. For the suggestions of best practice,
                                                      however, there were no target indicators of the number of suggestions expected or
                                                      of their technical scope.
 …a clear strategy to achieve results (log-           Yes: The TOR for the ESW made clear how the consultants were to estimate the
frame)?                                               baseline through research of representative samples of households and how the
                                                      consultants were to identify existing solutions that worked well.
Results achieved
In the client country/countries, were the findings
of the product used…
 …in government policy law or regulation?             Not yet: The legislation is already in place. What is needed is to apply it rigorously
                                                      to the sanitation sector. IEG did not learn of new legislation in the pipeline relevant
                                                                    42


                                                      to the sanitation sector.
 …in design of spending or investment                 Not yet: Agreement and implementation of a mega-investment program of urban
 programs?                                            sanitation and drainage is precisely what Vietnam’s cities need, but it is too much
                                                      to expect just two projects and one piece of AAA to finalize such a program. The
                                                      scale and financing constraints of such a program meant that it requires extensive
                                                      consideration by the ESW clients. These only began following the August 2010
                                                      Workshop. A final agreement on the investment program will only be possible after
                                                      the technical uncertainty of the sewage treatment and environmental effectiveness
                                                      of on-site septic tanks is verified—a question that the ESW left pending. On the
                                                      other hand, the ESW team argued that the ESW had increased the Bank’s own
                                                      awareness of the sanitation and drainage sector’s challenges in Vietnam, thereby
                                                      proposing more Bank assistance in this area.
 …to raise stakeholder awareness?                     Yes: The IEG mission met with or contacted all ESW clients. All were aware of the
                                                      issues raised by the ESW and its findings regarding the urban sanitation baseline
                                                      and suggestions for best practice solutions.
 …to build a coalition for change?                    Not yet: It is too early to be sure. A community of practice has formed, but only
                                                      when the change has been realized can we consider whether that community really
                                                      qualified as a coalition of change.
 …to build in-country capacity?                       Yes: Certainly, in-country capacity has increased significantly, but this probably
                                                      owes more to the Three Cities Sanitation Project and its opportunities for on-the-job
                                                      learning than to this ESW.
 …to influence the donor community?                   Yes: Bilateral multilateral donors have been made more aware of the challenges
                                                      and priorities of the urban sanitation and drainage sector. This has yet to translate
                                                      into change within their programs of assistance to Vietnam, however.
 …to change institutions?                             Yes: Merging sanitation/drainage and the water utilities, has been done in three
                                                      provinces, as the ESW proposed. The first of the two main changes on the agenda,
                                                      namely putting the sanitation utilities on to a more commercial footing has yet to be
                                                      fully implemented.
In the Bank, were findings of product used in …
 …the design of development policy lending?           No: Vietnam, has expressed a preference for investment lending over DPLs.
 …the design of Bank lending products?                Not yet: It is too early to say. Thus far the designs of newer Bank lending products
                                                      in Vietnam were completed before the final version of the report.
 …Bank strategy formulation?                          No: Thus far, there has been no new strategy formulated for the sanitation and
                                                      drainage sector in Vietnam.
 …future knowledge products?                          No: The ESW itself was not a typical knowledge product and it did not aim to
                                                      influence other knowledge products.
   …informing the strategic approach to the           Yes: Through a new Bank public expenditure review of Vietnam, currently under
     country (notably CAS/PRSP)?                      preparation.
If there were recorded results, is there evidence     No: The principal result was the provision of baseline data on different aspects of
     that they are likely to be sustainable?          Vietnam’s sanitation sector. Baselines are constantly shifting and, in a year or two,
                                                      the 2009-2010 baseline will be of less interest than it is today.
Monitoring of impact
Did the Bank or the client undertake an               No: As with most ESW, the Bank has no plans to conduct a self-evaluation of what
assessment of the product’s impact?                   was achieved.

The ESW achieved its intended results of providing a baseline assessment of urban sanitation services, and also provided some
suggestions on best practices for on-site sanitation. Particularly at the national level, the ESW helped raise sector stakeholders’
awareness of the challenges posed by the precarious baseline or urban sanitation infrastructure and services in the country. The sector
dialogue in Vietnam was considerably enhanced through the August 2010 workshop to discuss the ESW preliminary findings In
hindsight, it appears that a workshop of this kind has been more effective in eliciting government responses than the formal delivery of
the final version of a report with which officials were familiar in its earlier draft forms. The ESW helped bring the sanitation sector to the
forefront of a public expenditure review for Vietnam that the Bank is currently preparing. Results rating: Satisfactory.




                               Summary of Strategic Relevance and Ownership
Did the delivery of the product come in time to       Yes: The government is, at this writing, conducting a review of it policy and
affect relevant policy decisions by the               strategy toward addressing the sanitation and drainage challenges of Vietnam’s
government (―just-in-time‖)?                          cities. It is not clear at this time, however, how long this process will last and when
                                                      it will reach a definitive conclusion. The 2010 Workshop dissemination of the ESW
                                                                   43


                                                      was in time to draw the attention of the January 2011 Vietnam Communist Party’s
                                                      11th National Congress and also to serve as a potential input into the Vietnam’s
                                                      2011-2015 Five Year Plan. IEG was not able to identify any evidence of a specific
                                                      ESW impact in either of these two areas.
Was the topic or issue identified as a
development constraint or opportunity in (note
all that apply)…
 …the relevant CAS?                                   Yes: The current 2007-2011 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) prioritizes
                                                      increasing the access by the poor to urban water and sanitation services (World
                                                      Bank 2007 p.7).
 …previous sector work?                               No: The ESW presently under review is the first Bank-supported sector work for
                                                      sanitation in Vietnam
 …particular projects (specify)?                      Yes: Both in its design and throughout its implementation, the 1999-2008 Vietnam
                                                      Three Cities Sanitation Project (Cr. 3211), also reviewed by this PAR, identified
                                                      urban sanitation as an urgent topic to address. Although focused upon the project
                                                      cities of Haiphong, Danang, Halong and Cam Pha, IEG found evidence of the
                                                      exchange of this project experience (especially in Danang) with other cities
                                                      throughout Vietnam.
 …particular evaluations (specify)?                   No: IEG evaluated the 1997-2004 Vietnam Water Supply Project through a PPAR
                                                      in 2009, rating its outcome Satisfactory. But IEG could find no reference to the
                                                      PPAR in the ESW report.
 …policy dialogue with clients?                       Yes: The primary modality of disseminating the ESW findings and
                                                      recommendations was through dialogue with the ESW clients, particularly MOC. At
                                                      this writing, a summary final report will be presented to MOC in Hanoi in May 2011,
                                                      and thereafter more widely disseminated.
 …donor coordination forums?                          na.
     If applicable: In countries where dialogue       na. The Bank:Borrower dialogue in Vietnam about the sanitation sector has not
     is difficult, did the product…                   been a difficult one. The Government of Vietnam, provincial and city governments
                                                      are all concerned about sanitation and drainage challenges of Vietnam’s cities,
                                                      their adverse impacts upon the environment, and the cities’ vulnerability to natural
                                                      disaster. At all levels, Vietnamese interlocutors have been willing to engage with
                                                      the Bank, whose sectoral specialists share these concerns. It may take time to
                                                      reach a consensus on sectoral policy and strategy, but, if so, this would be more
                                                      due to the protracted process of the formulating and changing policy on the
                                                      Vietnamese side, involving high level reviews and approvals by, among other
                                                      things, an over-stretched prime minister’s office.

Ownership
Is the product part of an overall program of AAA      No:
to which the authorities have contributed or
agreed?
Did the client request or commission the specific     No:
product?
Did the client cover some or all of the costs?        No: All costs, apart from Bank staff costs, were borne by AusAID.
Did key decision makers (as distinct from             Yes: Altogether 47 officials and experts attended the August workshop in Hanoi,
technical specialists) collaborate with, discuss or   including 13 delegates from government ministries led by the vice minister of MOC,
provide feedback on the product?                      and 8 high levels representatives from subnational government concerned with
                                                      sanitation.
Did a local institute, academy, consulting firm or
government agency help to (note all that apply):
 …define the scope of the work?                       Yes: The Vietnamese Association of Sanitation Utilities lobbied hard for the Bank
                                                      to carry out this ESW, proposing that the work focus upon low-cost technical
                                                      sanitation solutions that could easily be applied locally. This corresponded to the
                                                                     44


                                                    initial focus of the ESW, and while reflected in the ESW’s second objective, it
                                                    began to take second place during the execution of the work.
 …plan and design the work?                         No: The work was planned and designed primarily by the Bank in consultation with
                                                    AusAID.
 …carry out the work?                               No: The ESW was carried out exclusively by the consultants contracted for the job
                                                    (Hydroconseil of France and PEMConsult of Denmark).
 …analyze the results and write the report?         Yes: Government agencies analyzed the preliminary ESW results in detail at the
                                                    Hanoi workshop, and are currently reviewing the content of the final report. They
                                                    were not involved in the writing the report.
  …formulate conclusions and                        No: The ESW task manager was primarily responsible for formulating the ESW
recommendations?                                    conclusions and recommendations.
  …provide peer review or comments on the           No:
draft report?
  …organize workshops or discussions about the      No: A August 2011 workshop in Hanoi was organized, but by the Bank TTL, not by
findings?                                           the clients.
The ESW was consistent with relevant to country partnership strategy (CPS) priorities of improving access of the poor to sanitation as a
top priority (World Bank 2007 p. 33), and improving the quality of urban services themselves for stronger environmental protection and
public health improvements. The report was very timely in that it was prepared as the government was designing a major investment
program in the sanitation, thereby helping better inform government of the baseline constraints facing the sector. The delivery of the
ESW coincided with the acceleration of program implementation scheduled to run to 2025. IEG noted that ownership of the ESW was
strong at the level of central government in Hanoi. A large number of government officials attended the August 2010 workshop,
providing feedback to help the consultants update an earlier draft of the report. Strategic relevance and ownership rating: Satisfactory.




                                                    Summary of Quality
Did the product…
 …include appropriate knowledge (i.e. make
    use of current and relevant knowledge from
    both inside and outside of the Bank)?
 …cite relevant examples of practice or             Yes: The report referred to the considerable investment being made in China in
    research from other countries in the region?    sewage treatment plants. (ESW limited attention to examples in other countries should not be
                                                    interpreted as a shortcoming of advisory work geared to the specific of the sanitation sector in Vietnam,

  research from other regions?                      areas of cities in the USA and Europe. (ESW limited attention to examples in other countries
                                                    should not be interpreted as a shortcoming of advisory work geared to the specific of the sanitation sector
                                                    in Vietnam, some of which are peculiar to the country itself)
 …discuss the specific institutional and policy     Yes: The report does this thoroughly, demonstrating a clear understanding of the
  context for the issue in this country?            specific institutional and policy context into which its findings and recommendations
                                                    must be inserted. Including financing, fully one third of the final ESW report is
                                                    devoted to the baseline institutional and policy context of the sector.
 …collect and analyze existing local data?          Yes and No: At the micro level, the ESW did conduct a small survey of
                                                    households in two locations. At the macro level—city-wide, provincial and
                                                    national—there was no new data collection. Existing data at the macro level is only
                                                    sporadically available in Vietnam. For this reason, the ESW consultants decided
                                                    pragmatically to model key variables (see below) such as the likely production of
                                                    wastewater, rather than spending considerable resources in trying to locate local
                                                    sources of such that may or may not be accessible. Perhaps more attention could
                                                    have been given to data on environmental and public health conditions. These are
                                                    fundamental variables that characterize the baseline, but which are given only
                                                    cursory treatment by the ESW.
 …generate new evidence?                            Yes: The most important new evidence assembled by the ESW was of the 2009
                                                    baseline of Vietnam’s urban sanitation itself. The ESW laid out clearly the
                                                    shortcomings of urban sanitation in the baseline conditions, notably refining the
                                                    estimates of the (very low) proportion of all wastewater treated. It also assembled
                                                    an estimate of the investment needed to overcome the deficits identified. All these
                                                    data were produced via modeling the production, collection and treatment of urban
                                                               45


                                                 wastewater, for which a consistent data set is not readily available in Vietnam.
                                                 Also, through its survey of 105 households in three cities in Vietnam, the ESW did
                                                 collect new information about the their use of sanitation services, but it is not clear
                                                 to what extent the findings had general validity, since the respondents were not
                                                 randomly selected.
 …include recommendations?                       Yes: The summary final report contained seven recommendations, summarized
                                                 here:
                                                 1. Systematic analysis of treatment efficiency of septic tanks needed to confirm
                                                       their effectiveness.
                                                 2. Design and apply institutional arrangements, incentives and sanctions to
                                                       ensure regular cleaning of septic tanks and safe disposal of sludge.
                                                 3. Verify the economic efficiency of proposed technical solutions, given their
                                                       high costs.
                                                 4. The government of Vietnam to confirm that financing plans for sanitation is
                                                       feasible.
                                                 5. Review wastewater tariff policies to reduce reliance on subsidies.
                                                 6. The government of Vietnam to apply governance models that are effective in
                                                       addressing health, environmental, service quality and financing issues related
                                                       to sanitation.
                                                 7. The government of Vietnam to actively promote mergers water supply and
                                                       sewerage/drainage utilities, with options to introduce the private sector.
Do the recommendations include specified         Yes: Recommendations 4-7 are directly explicitly at The government of Vietnam,
actions to be taken by specified actors (incl.   particularly the principal ESW client ministry MOC, but also MPI and MOF who
non-Bank)?                                       have responsibilities for budgeting government investment in sanitation, and setting
                                                 the rules for tariffs. It is less clear who are responsible for carrying through
                                                 recommendations 1-3.
Was the product team staffed with the            Yes: For the most part the ESW was well staffed with qualified Vietnamese and
appropriate expertise (incl. consultants)?       international staff and consultants. Together, they proved to be very knowledgeable
                                                 about the baseline conditions of urban sanitation in Vietnam and the institutional
                                                 context overlaying it. One area of insufficient expertise, evidenced by
                                                 recommendation 1 above, is on the technical performance of the septic tank
                                                 solution universally adopted in all cities in Vietnam. Instead of recommending an
                                                 analysis of their treatment efficiency, it would have been better if the ESW had
                                                 provided the answers itself as part of the baseline.
Did product receive appropriate managerial       Yes: Management even made specific proposals about how to present the report
attention?                                       to government
Did the product receive sufficient budget?       Yes: Actual spending perfectly matched the initial budget.
Review of content
Was the draft peer-reviewed by appropriate       Yes: The TTL mobilized a former Bank staff with considerable worldwide
experts?                                         experience in Bank assistance to urban sanitation, as well as the World Bank
                                                 country office to review the various drafts of the report.
Were the peer-review comments taken into         Yes: High-level sector experts and former Bank staff were hired for peer review,
account as appropriate?                          and the TTL ensured that relevant inputs from them were included in the report.
Was the feedback from the client about the       Yes: Feedback given at the August 2010 Workshop, particularly about the need to
product incorporated into the final version?     focus more upon policy and finance of sanitation was incorporated into the final
                                                 version of the ESW report that provided fewer suggestions of best practice
                                                 technical solutions than expected at the outset.

The Bank has had a half-century of worldwide experience of supporting sanitation improvement in cities and was thus be well
positioned to provide the high quality professional and technical advice that Vietnam’s sought and continues to seek for this sector.
Several senior Bank experts from the sanitation sector worked on the report. The ESW launched its own survey to collect primary data
from 105 households in Ho Chi Minh City, Can Tho and Quang Ngai to find out what kind of sanitation services they had and what they
wanted. The ESW reports made very few explicit references to the drainage and sanitation experiences of other countries. But this
should not be seen as a shortcoming of the work. Vietnam’s urban sanitation (and drainage) challenges are very specific to the
conditions of the country’s cities, maybe unique in at least two respects, their low-lying coastal sites make sanitation and drainage
operations costly, and no major city has purpose-built sewerage collection network. The specific approach to Vietnam was well served
by ESW, which carried out a thorough analysis of the institutional arrangements for the sector in the country. The report included 14
quite specific recommendations on the technical, financing and institutional aspects of sanitation in Vietnam. Quality rating:
Satisfactory.




                           Summary of Dissemination and Sustained Dialogue
Initial Dissemination
Was the product…
 …made available in the local language?            No: The study team would like to, but budget constraints are likely to prevent
                                                   translation.
 …made available on a website?                     Not yet: The plan is to disseminate the study on the web after the government had
                                                   made its position clear on each of the ESW recommendations.
 …discussed with senior policy-makers?             Yes: The Vice-Minister of MOC participated in the August 2010 Workshop, as did
                                                   high-ranking officials of city sanitation utilities.
 …presented at a workshop, conference,             Yes: A one-day Workshop, based upon a preliminary draft of the ESW report, was
  seminar or on-line discussion?                   held in Hanoi in August 2010, attended by 47 participants. Currently, there are no
                                                   plans for similar events in the near future.
 …covered in the general or specialized media?     No:
Sustained dialogue
Did the product serve as an input to a sustained
engagement with the client through…
 …policy dialogue?                                 Yes: Thus far, there have been three milestones in the policy dialogue with the
                                                   government of Vietnam : (i) over the preparation and design of the study; (ii) during
                                                   the August 2010 Workshop; and (iii) in the run-up to the presentation of the final
                                                   report summary to MOC. Given the important sector issues raised by this dialogue
                                                   thus far, there is every reason to suppose it will continue.
 …sustained workshops/discussions with             na. Too early to say
   stakeholders beyond initial dissemination?
 …lending products (Bank and non-Bank)?            At the present time, two urban sanitation projects are under preparation by Bank
                                                   staff and TTLs who were involved in the ESW and the earlier Three Cities
                                                   Sanitation Project. They are:(i) the US$200 million Urban Water Supply and
                                                   Wastewater Project; and (ii) the US$65.3 million additional financing for Vietnam:
                                                   Coastal Cities Environmental Sanitation Project
 …technical assistance (formal or informal)?       No:
 …programmatic instruments?                        No:
 …other means (please discuss below)?              No:
                                                                           47


 The final ESW report was formally sent in June 2011 to MOC, Vietnam’s principal government authority for sanitation, but the effective
 dissemination of the work occurred earlier through the August 2010 workshop in Hanoi launched to discuss the then preliminary
 findings. The report reached effectively the right audiences through the August 2010 workshop in Hanoi that was well attended by 47
 high-level participants representing central and local government and technical institutes. Their feedback was well documented over six
 pages in an annex of the ESW final report. On the technical side, several participants raised questions and doubts about the septic
 tanks, whether they are a good option, work efficiently, or leak. They urged that the study should clarify whether septic tanks are a good
 or bad option. That such questions could arise in a meeting of sanitation experts in Vietnam indicates that the report was dealing with
 topics of considerable interest (and concern) to audience. Dissemination and sustained dialogue rating: Satisfactory.




                                                           Summary of Ratings
 Strategic relevance and ownership                          Satisfactory. The ESW focused upon one of the country’s principal development
                                                            constraints, widely recognized as such in Vietnam and by the Bank. It was very
                                                            timely, prepared as the government was designing a major investment program in
                                                            the sector, and delivered as that program gathered speed. Furthermore, there is
                                                            evidence of strong local ownership and engagement that peaked at the time of the
                                                            August 201 workshop in Hanoi.
 Quality                                                    Satisfactory. The report successfully deploying existing sector knowledge that was
                                                            well-founded in the Bank, it dealt pragmatically with constraints upon good
                                                            empirical sector data in Vietnam, it had a good understanding of local conditions
                                                            thanks to Vietnamese and Vietnam-experienced team members, and with peer
                                                            review led to practical recommendations to guide the sector
 Dialogue and Dissemination                                 Satisfactory. Particularly through the August 2010 workshop in Hanoi, the report
                                                            was successfully disseminated among key sector stakeholders, stimulating
                                                            important discussions among them. Several workshop participants provided
                                                            feedback on the report’s findings and recommendations, helping their final
                                                            formulations.

 Results                                                    Satisfactory. The ESW had a substantial impact on the sector dialogue in the
                                                            country particularly through the August 2010. It can be expected to have impacts
                                                            on government programs too, but these effects still need more time to work
                                                            themselves through. The ESW also had a substantial impact upon Bank assistance
                                                            to the sanitation sectors in Vietnam, both through additional investment lending and
                                                            through a follow-on ESW that will focus more upon the technical issues facing the
                                                            sector and technical recommendations about the kind of solutions to be adopted.
                                                            Achieving its own objectives—unusually explicit for this particular ESW—is not
                                                            factored into the results rating of this assessment, but they deserve comment here.
                                                            The ESW was successful in providing the promised baseline, although it fell
