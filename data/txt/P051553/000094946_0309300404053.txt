Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project                   Additional Works Project - EMP
Danang Sub-project                                                         August 2003
1. Introduction
1.1    Background
Phase I of Danang- Sanitation Project xvas approved by Governmileit of Vietnam in Decision No
414/QD-TTg dated April 20, 1999 with total investment of about USD 41 million. Pliase I wvill
support improved sanitation services to 33 phuongs in Danang's five ulbanl districts. Kev drainage
and wastewatcr works supported by tile Phase I include:
*   installation of gravity interception drains (GlDs), connections and rising mains;
*  construction1 of drv weathier tiow diversion strUctUres within major existing drains;
* installation of submersible purnp stations;
*   installation of primary treatment plants (F1oa Cuong, Phlu Loc, NguL Haanil Son, and Son Tra)
with capacities ranging from 3.7 to 45 M'IL/day;
*  construction of major drains in critical areas in Danang;
* construction of public toilets, some of whiich are incorporated into solid waste transfer
stations; and
*   implementation of comnmunitv based sanitation improveinenit programs involving community
educationi programs.
The construction of Pliase I works is currently underway and is expected to bring substantial net
benefits to Danang city. Due to savings generated through Phase l's bidding process, about 11 USD
million of additional drainagre and wastewater works (hereafter known as the Additional Works
Project) have been approved both bv World Bank (in Aide M\e[emoire of April 2, 2002) and Danang
Peoples' Committee (in Decision No 1450/VP of April 11, 2002). A feasibility study for the
additional works was prepared in the second half of 2002. The final version was completed in
November 2002. CivMC was assigned to prepare detailed designs for all additional works. A start with
design activities was made in Februa-y 2003 and this EIA report is part of the output of the
engineering studv.
1.2    Preposed Drainage and Wastewater Improvement
The majority of Project funds will be tised to support drainage works (USD 7.6 million). Wastewater
works are the Project's second budgetary prioritv (USD 1.6 million), and beach cleaning is a tertiary
priority (USD 0. 1 million). The remaining funlds are allocated to consulting fees, contingencies, and
taxes (USD 1.7 million).
1.3    Proposed Drainage Works
Thle Project wvill construct drainage: I) in Binil lThliain ward fiom Le Dinii Tham to LDuy Tan Roacl; 2)
fiom Dien Bien Phu Steet to Danang Bay thlloLlgl Le Do Street; 3) fiom Dien Bien PIhu Steet (Xuan
H-oa pond) to Trani Cao Van Street (PlItI Loc River); 4) fi-om An KhCe pond to Phu Loc River; and 5)
ftroim i9v Khe to Bac tle AAn. A sumIml-arv of drainLage works supportecd by the Project is found in

2. Potential Environmental Impacts of the Project
2.1     Summary of Impacts
The EIA evaluated a range of potential impacts that could occur as a result of the Project. The
selection of potential impacts for evaluation was based on site visits, discussions with Phase I project
staff, URENCO, DoSTE and others; and through review of relevant documents such as World Bank's
Environmental Assessment Sourcebook, Phase I environmental assessment reports, the Project's
Feasibility Study and others. Table I provides a summary impact evaluation of potential impacts that
could be created by the Project. These impacts are further detailed in the EIA Report.

Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project                    Additional Works Project - EMP
Danang Sub-project                                                          August 2003
2.1     Pre-Construction Phase Impacts
Pre-construction phase activities include resettleinent, land allocation, and land clearing. The impact
of these activities on affected persons (resettlers, land owners) is loni term and permanent. Tlle
Project is developin(g a detailed Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). Thle RAPs objectives include:
1) providing recommendations to minimise resettlement and land acquisition; and 2) provide fair
compensation schemes for those whose land, hoQLues, cultural property, and graves must be purchased
or relocated by the Project. The RAP is a stand-alone document that can be used as a reference for
further details on impacts identified in this section.
2.2    Construction Phase Impacts
Construction phase impacts are generally short term, localised, and reversible. As with most urban
civil works projects, constrLction phase impacts usually have negative human health, safetv, and
environmental consequences. This section identities the most likely impacts that will arise durinig
construction, and provides both mitigation objectives and measures to achieve those objectives. As
described below, many of these measures can be directly inserted into Contractor Specifications. This
will help ensure that the measures are woven into the norrnal scope of Project works, that the
measures can be monitored, and that if the measures are not achieved, then there is a means to apply
negative consequences to the delinquent partv (in most cases, the Contractor).
2.3    Operation Phase Impacts
Operation phase impacts will be long term and cumulative. As the Project is essentially a set of urban
environmental mitigation measures, the operation phase impacts are almost entirely positive.

3. Environmental Mitigation Plan
3.1    Approach to Developing Mitigation Measures
When constructing the mitigation measure tables of Section 3, the following points were considered:
*  Mitigation measures for negative impacts identified in Section 2 (regardless of their
magnitude) are considered in Section 3 tables.
* Construction mitigation measures are, whenever possible, woven into the construction
specifications. This enables the Engineer to have significant authoritv over the
implementation of mitigation measures.
* "Environmental Best Practices" will not be made explicit within the Contractor
Specifications. This in line with the general approach to seamlessly integrating environment
into contract management and civil works projects in general.
* If a measure was considered to be ineffective during Phase I (e.g. spraying roads with water
to reduce dust) alternate mitigation measures were considered.
*  Costs that WLould be borne by the Contractor are not identified in this table -these costs will
become part of ihe competitive bid of contractors. Costs of resettlement and land acquisition
will be identified in the Resettlement Action Plan.

4. Environmental Monitoring
The Project's performance and environmental effects will be monitored throughoult pre-construction,
construction, and operation.
Performance monitoring is conducted to evaluate compliance with standard operating procedures
(SOP), national standards, and/or contractor specifications. In most cases performance monitoring
results are evaluated against established performance criteria. For example: I) a Contractor
specification may be to place a tarp over all vehicles that carry soil. The performance monitoring
activity could be to count the number of soil-carrying vehicles that use tarps, and compare the result
against the Contractor Specification; 2) Wastewater effluent may be monitored and compared witi
national standards for xvastevater quality.
Environmental effects monitoring is conducted to estimate the impacts of project activities on
ambient environmental conditions. For example, total suspended particulate matter (i.e., dust) may be
measured to estimate the degree to which project activities are affecting ambient air qualitv; 2) Fecal
coliform levels in the river may be measured to estimate the impact of wastewater effluent on the
river water quality.
In both cases, it is recommended that URENCO's Environmental Mvfonitoring Team play the primary
role in managing and implementing Project monitoring activities. This team has received substantial
training and experience on environmental monitoring through Phase I project and they should be able
to conduct most of the tasks identified in the below table with some occasional guidance from an
international environmental specialist.
Detailed monitoring programmes should be developed during Pre-construction. The tables in this
section can be used as a guide to develop the detailed monitoring programmes

Due to a recent restructuring of URENCO and Phase I PLvIU, URENCO's current capacity to manage
ENIP activities during pre-constrUction and construction of the Additional Works Project is relatively
low. Selected URENCO staff wyould benefit from a qualified international environmental specialist
who can provide appropriate capacity development assistance. The international environmental
specialist's assistance should focus on providing "learning by doing" guidance on design,
management, and reporting of the EivlP's pre-constriction/construction monitoring and mitigation,
activities. The estimated level of effort for an international environmental specialist durinig pre-
construction and construction is three months.
6.2    Operations Phase
Capacity Building Requirements of URENCO
As with pre-construction and construction, URENCO's currenlt capacity to manage EMvP activities
during operation is relatively low. Selected URENCO staff would benefit from  a qualified
international environmental specialist to provide "learning by doing" guidance on the management
and reporting of operations phase monitoring and mitigation activities identified in the EIP. The
estimated level of effort for an international environmental specialist during operation is one montlh.

Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project                         Additional Works Project - EMP
Danang Sub-project                                                                August 2003
7. Costs of Implementing the EMP
This section estimates the marginal costs for condUCting the EMP's main SLub-components:
mitigation, monitoring, and capacity building. Costs that are inCLirred by other project components
but satisfy some aspect of thie EMP are not inciluded in this section. Thle division of costs between
URENCO and IDA funids was developed in conisultation with URE-NCO PMU Director.
Thie total marginal cost of the EMP from Pre-Construction throughl to the end of the first year of
operation is 117,700 USD (not inCiLuding continigencies, taxes, or inflation). This amouint is abouIt
1.07 % of the project's estimated USD I1I million buidget. EMP costs can be broken down as
follows: Pre-Construction ('31,800 USD);- ConistruICtion: (64,200 USD); and Operation 21,700 USD
(Year 1); and 3,1 00 USD (Year 2 onwards). More detailed estimates are fouind in Table 5.
