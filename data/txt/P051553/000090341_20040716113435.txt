2.    Overview of implemenllec RAP Reports
2.1. Initial RAP Report
The first RAP was prepared in February 1999 by Soil and Water Consultant, approved by the
relevant authorities and has been carrying out by the PMU.
It described the procedures required for the preparation of RAP for the sanitation project. It
contained the objcctives and principles of RAP, a general compensation and entitlements
policy and matrix, a legal framewvork, institutional arrangements, the contents of public
participation and consultationi programs, grievance procedures and an internal and external
I   monitor-ing programl.
It conitained the scope of the components requiring land acquisition and resettlement, socio -
economic characteristics of the project affected persons, results of the detailed measurement
surveys, detailed specified entitlement policies and compensation matrix, estimiated costs and
budget, and the iniiplementation schedule for the components i.c. (a) rehabilitation of the
drainage canals, and (b) construction of sludge disposal and septage treatmenit facilities at
Tran,g Cat landfill.

It also provided an assessment of the potential of the additional resettlement that may arise
duriing the implementation of the project components.
2.2. Overview of RAP 3
It is already foreseen in the initial RAP Report that the project contents components for
which resettlemaent can only be determined after the detailed designs have been completed
and during the projcct implementation.
The potential for resettlement arising from the implementation are:
Ticin Nga. 1io Sen, Du Hang and Lam Tuong lakes
Clearanice aroulld the lakes (which was not included in the lakes rehabilitation on the
initial RAP) with 6m width.
The periodic desILidging of the lakes used for rainwater retention is unavoidable. This
requires resettlemenlt of houses built on the lakeshores to reclaim sufficient land along side
the lakes to provide the necessary access.
The PMU has decidcd that the resettlemenm,t magnitude is of great significanlce, therefore, a
full RAP 3 is rcquired, keeping in line witlh the policies/principles of the initial RAP Report
with updated socio  economic paraLmeters.

arc carnie(d out as l'bllowing:
*    Cat Bi and Pihuong Luu lakes
Protectioni cor-ridor- of 6m wide arounld the lakcs will be c;cared off. Cat Bi lake is in Cat Bi
ward, Ngo QuyenI district with prescnt area of 3S,000 m2. it locates close to Lach Tray river.
The lake manau,errent area is from the above edge of the lake at the height of 3.8m to 6m
towards the population area. Phuong Luu lakc is presently a agricultural field in Dong Hai
ward, Hai An district which will bc constructed as a regulation lake of 24 hectares of area.
Thc lake will be cemibanked, with manageement road of 6m of width. A new canal of over
2()()m of length and 15 m of width will be constructed to connect the lake to the Northeast
Ca;nal. Managemncit roads along canal sides of Om will be build and a consultant's workoffice
of 500m2 will be set by the lake.
The periodic desluidging of the lakes used for rainwater retention is unavoidable. This
lreCLuires resettlernem-nt of houses built on1 the lakeshores to reclaim sufficient land along side
the lakes to provide the necessary access.
I'hc PMU has decided that the resettlemenm,t magnitude is of great significance, therefore, a
full RAP 4 is rtequiled, keeping in line with the policies/principles of the initial RAP Report
,A itll updated socio  economnic paramiieters.
3.1   Compensation and Entitlenient Porcy
Project Affected Pcr-sons (PAPs) are people who will have their: (a) stanidard of living
ad\vcrsely affected; or (b) right, title or intcrcst on all or part of any house, lanid or any other
fixed or movable asset acquired or possessed temporarily or permanently; or (c) business,
occLupationi, placc of work or residenice or habitat adversely affected temiiporarily or
perm-lanenitly.
The general principles of compensatioin and entitlement are summarized as follows:

Every severely affected PAP would also be entitlied to subsistence allowance duLring transition
period, anid inicome reilabilitationi allowance.
The Provincial People's Committee (PPC) will establish unit rates for compensation for land
and structures. During the implementation, rates of compensation for land and structures will
be updated to reflect current market rates.
3.2    Legal Franiework
The resettlement an(d rehabilitation plan described has been designed in accordance with the
laws of the GOV aned the provisions of the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.30. The
basis guiding principle of the World Bank's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement is that the
affected people should be "assisted in their effrorts to improve their former living standards,
income earninig capacity, and production le, els, or at least to restore them".
3.3    Institutional Arrangements
The roles and  responsibilities of' institutes involved in the implementation of the land
acC lnisition and resettlement activities are summarized below:
*            People committee of Haiphong City
-  establisling a resettlement comnmittee

Ilhe issues to be dealt with are also of conlicting interest. Therefore, careful aind punctual
preparation for implementation of RAP is as important as preparation of the actual plan.

I[he rates of affectcte land, structures anid other fixed assets detemnined for ustimation of
resettlemenlt costs will be updated at the timie of acquisition of assets to reflect prevailing
mnarket rates. Rates establislhed for affected structures will be based on 'affected' area and at
replacement cost without depreciation and without deduction for salvageable materials. Rates
bor structures will be calculated for affected area. Compensation rates will be adjusted for
infltlion at the timie of compensation. Rates must be established before compensation
etiillemenits can be calculated.
4.4    Conducting Public Informiiation Campaign

I      General
The Project contains components for which resettlement can only be deteminied
during the pr-oject implemenitationi. This situation occurs for several reasons: (a) the
precise impacts of these components can only be determiined after the finalization of
the alignmniiits and selection of alternlatives following conIsultation witlh relevanlt
authorities, (b) one objective of detailed design is to adopt constrLction metlhods
whlich mliniilmize resettlemenit etc.
Consequently, the Project slhould anticipate the possibility of a supplementary RAP -
a RAP 5 - to be submitted during the implementation phase. Suchi RAP 5 would be
implemenitcl three montlhs bef'ore the construction works requiring resettlemllenlt
would be coummenced.
