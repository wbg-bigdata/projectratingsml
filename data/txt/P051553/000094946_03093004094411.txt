Danang Sanitation Project - Additional Works          Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
Executive Summary
Introduction
The construction of Phase I of Danang Drainage and Sanitation Project covering Danang's five
urban districts is currently underway and is expected to bring substantial net benefits to
Danang city. Due to the savings generated through Phase l's bidding process, about 11 USD
million of additional drainage and wastewater works (hereafter known as the Additional Works
Project) have been approved both by World Bank (in Aide Memoire of April 2, 2002) and
Danang Peoples' Committee (in Decision No 1450/VP of April 11, 2002).
The majority of Additional Works Project funds will be used to support drainage works (USD
7.6 million). Wastewater works are the Project's second budgetary priority (USD 1.6 million),
and beach cleaning is a tertiary priority (USD 0.1 million). The drainage works comprise five
components:
i) in Binh Thuan ward from Le Dinh Tham to Duy Tan Road; ii) from Dien Bien Phu Street to
Danang Bay through Le Do Street; iii) from Dien Bien Phu Street (Xuan Hoa pond) to Tran
Cao Van Street (Phu Loc River); iv) from An Khe pond to Phu Loc River; and v) from My Khe
to Bac Me An.
The drainage component of the project will cause some adverse impacts on peoples' assets.
The wastewater works and beach cleaning components will not result in adverse impacts on
peoples' assets nor will they cause any loss of businesses or incomes. The Resettlement
Action Plan (RAP) covering the impacts caused by the drainage component of the Additional
Works Project is prepared within the scope of the resettlement policy framework presented in
Part I of the Phase I RAP. This RAP for the Additional Works Project, without repeating the
provisions of the Policy, thus covers: a) project components and impacts; b) compensation
entitlement policy; c) costs and budgets; and d) implementation arrangements.
For the RAP preparation census, inventory and socio-economic surveys were conducted
covering 143 PAPs. The socio-economic characteristics of the PAPs indicate that:
* Average household size of the PAPs in the four sub-project areas is 5.8.
* Most of the households are either salaried persons working in government departments
(42.1%) or in business and commerce (37.8%). A small number of households also earn
their living by fishing (9.8%) or through agricultural activities (9.8%).
* Majority (50.3%) of the surveyed households have an average monthly household income
ranging between one to 2 million VND. The percentage of those earning below one million
VND is 32.2%. 25 households or 17.5%, have an average monthly household income of
more than 2 million VND. Most of these come from the Le Do area.
Impacts of the Project
The Additional Works Project will affect a total of 187 PAPs. Except for the Le Do area, other
components will result in only marginal impacts on the PAPs. In Le Do the major impact is due
to the proposed road and a 23 m (20 m for plots and 3 m for a lane) wide adjoining areas on
both sides of the road designated for redevelopment. The urban redevelopment of the area,
including the road, will affect a total of 102 households, 90 of them severely.
Loss of Agricultural Land
The project will impact a total of 40 PAPs due to the loss of agricultural land. Most of these
PAPs (32 Households) are in the An Khe area. Only four of the 32 PAPs affected in An Khe
area own the affected land. The remaining 28 PAPs have the affected land on lease from the
iii



Danang Sanitation Project - Additional Works         Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
ward. Total land that will need to be acquired totals 588 m2. Additionally, 2,526 m2 of ward
land that is on lease will need to be repossessed for the project.
Through the surveys, among 40 households affected by agricultural land, there are 15
households affected more than 20 % of their land holding in which 12 households in An Khe
and 3 households in My Khe. And other 25 households affected less than 20 %.
Loss of Residential Land
A total of 134 PAPs would be affected due to the loss of 11,978.5 m2 of residential land of
which 102 PAPs (10,364.5 m2) are affected due to the urban redevelopment project in Le Do
area. Of these 90 PAPs would be affected due to the loss of their entire land holdings (8,428.7
m2) while 12 PAPs will be affected due to the partial loss of residential land. In Le Dinh Tham,
13 PAPs (69.5 m2) will be affected by partial loss of residential land. The corresponding
number in My Khe is 19 PAPs with 1,544.5 m2.
Impacts on Structures
The project will impact a total of 110 PAPs due to the loss of structures. The total area of the
affected structures is 7,312.9 m2, taking into account all the floors. Majority of the affected
structures is category 3 and 4.
Loss of other Fixed Assets
A total of 75 PAPs, most of them in the Le Do area, will be affected by the loss of boundary
walls. 29 PAPs will be affected by the loss of fences. Additionally, the loss of paved yards will
impact a total of 78 PAPs, again most of them in the Le Do area. 4 PAPs in An Khe area would
be affected by the loss of fish-ponds (214 m2) and would be entitled to compensation for the
same.
A total of 24 PAPs would be affected due to the loss of trees, most of them in the Le Do area.
Loss of Incomes and Businesses
A total of 43 PAPs would be affected due to the loss of incomes from cultivation of agricultural
land. Additionally, a total of 12 PAPs will be affected by loss of business incomes. All these
businesses are managed from affected houses. Only 7 of the affected businesses will be
displaced by the project.
Impacts on Public Infrastructure and Utilities
The proposed drainage and associated road development will cause extensive impact on
existing public utilities such as: electric poles, power distribution lines, road side pavements,
existing drains etc. In accordance with the policy, all impacted public facilities and utilities will be
made good and the DNPC will ensure repairs and rehabilitation of all affected infrastructures.
Temporary Impacts
Construction works implementation of extended project will have temporary impacts on a
number of roadside businesses, houses and other establishments. The impacts would be
mainly the restricted access and inconvenience during the project implementation. There may
some minor impacts on the boundary walls, fences and other fixed assets during the
construction phase.
Relocation Requirements
Out of the 187 PAPs affected by the project, only 90 PAPs will be displaced requiring
relocation. All these PAPs are affected by the proposed road and redevelopment of Le Do area.
In addition to the 90 PAPs requiring relocation, another 12 PAPs would be marginally affected
due to the loss of residential land, houses and other fixed assets, trees, businesses and
incomes.
iv



Danang Sanitation Project - Additional Works         Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
The Da Nang Peoples' Committee (DNPC) proposes to develop the vacated area and provide
plots of regular size (4.5x20m) and sell them to people, with priority given to the PAPs. The
selling price is tentatively fixed at VND 3.0 million/m2 whereas the current compensation rate
for residential land in the area varies between 0.5 for land behind the main road, to VND 3.6
million/m2 for plots facing he main road. Further, after the redevelopment only a maximum of
68 plots can be planned in the area. Therefore, the remaining 22 PAPs are to be relocated at a
newly developed area in Thanh Loc Dan. At Thanh Loc Dan the selling price of the plots of
similar size is between VND 1.0-1.5 million per m2.
Since the developed plots at Le Do and Thanh Loc Dan area are to be sold to people, the
PAPs have the choice to either buy the developed plots from DNPC from the compensation
entitlements or settle themselves anywhere at their choice of location.
The Entitlement Matrix summarizing the entitlements for each category of PAPs is included in
the RAP.
Resettlement Cost
The resettlement cost for the project will be part of the project cost. They will be covered out of
the funds provided by DNPC and a necessary budget has been allocated for the purpose. The
resettlement cost of the Additional Works Project, estimated using the compensation rates and
allowances established by the DNPC, amount to VND 14,717million. This includes
contingencies of 10%, external-monitoring cost of VND 150 million, and administration cost of
VND 506 million. In the case of any over-runs, URENCO will be responsible to provide any
additional funds as necessary to ensure that resettlement implementation is carried out in a
timely manner.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Phase I of Danang Drainage and Sanitation Project was approved by Government of Vietnam
vide Decision No 414/QD-TTg dated April 20, 1999 with total investment of about USD 41
million. The objective of Phase I was to support improved sanitation services to 33 Phuongs in
Danang's five urban districts. Key drainage and wastewater works supported by the Phase I
include:
* Installation of new gravity interception drains (GIDs), connections and rising mains;
* Construction of new dry weather flow diversion structures within major existing drains;
* Installation of new submersible pump stations;
* Installation of new primary treatment plants (Hoa Cuong, Phu Loc, Ngu Hanh Son, and
Son Tra) with capacities ranging from 3.7 to 45 ML/day;
* Construction of new community toilets, some of which are incorporated into the solid
waste transfer stations; and
L Implementation of community based sanitation improvement programs involving
community education programs;
The construction of Phase I works are currently underway and are expected to bring
substantial net benefits to Danang city. Due to the savings generated through Phase l's
bidding process, about 11 USD million of additional drainage and wastewater works (hereafter
known as the Project) have been approved both by World Bank (in Aide Memoire of April 2,
2002) and Danang Peoples' Committee (in Decision No 1450A/P of April 11, 2002).
1.2 Project Components
The majority of Project funds will be used to support drainage works (USD 7.6 million).
Wastewater works are the Project's second budgetary priority (USD 1.6 million), and beach
cleaning is a tertiary priority (USD 0.1 million). Each are summarized below:
•  Drainage works: The Project will construct drainage:
1.   in Binh Thuan ward from Le Dinh Tham to Duy Tan Road;
2.    from Dien Bien Phu Street to Danang Bay through Le Do Street;
3.    from Dien Bien Phu Street (Xuan Hoa pond) to Tran Cao Van Street (Phu Loc
River);
4.    from An Khe pond to Phu Loc River; and
5.    from My Khe to Bac Me An.
o Wastewater Works: The Project will support:
1.    small additions to the Phase I wastewater system in Hoa Cuong, Son Tra, and
Ngu Hanh Son catchments. These additions will increase the capacity of
Danang's wastewater system by about 7%; and
2.    install floating covers on Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son wastewater treatment
plants.
* Beach Cleaning Works: The Project will purchase beach-cleaning equipments to clear
solid waste from the beaches of the South China Sea. These beaches are close to the
proposed drainage and sewerage works that are adjacent to the South China Sea.

1.3 Scope of the RAP
Danang city is in the process of rapid development: roads, bridges, residential and commercial
areas, wastewater treatment plants, drainage systems, and solid waste collection systems are
being constructed and rehabilitated via a number of domestic and donor-funded interventions
under the Master Plan. Development of major road network is one of the key features of the
ongoing development activities. The proposed wastewater works, and small parts the drainage
works under the project form an integral part of the ongoing road network development
program and will not cause any adverse impacts in terms of acquisition of private assets or in
loss of businesses and incomes independent of the road development that is being
implemented by the Danang city. The drainage component of the Project that is independent
of the road network development, with the exception of the Le Do Street, will cause only
marginal impacts resulting in loss of small strips of land or only small part of structures without
causing any displacement, and loss of some trees and crops. The wastewater component of
the project will not cause any direct loss of private assets or incomes of people.
The drainage component of the project will cause some adverse impacts on peoples' assets.
The Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) covering the impacts caused by the drainage component
of the Project is prepared in accordance with the relevant Laws of the Government of Vietnam
and the World Bank's Operational Directive 4.30.
Since the Project is an extension of the ongoing Phase I of Danang Drainage and Sanitation
Project, the resettlement policy framework for the Phase I RAP would also apply to the RAP for
the Project. The RAP of Danang Drainage and Sanitation project was approved by the DNPC
in the Decision No.1837/QD-UB dated April 20, 1999 in accordance with the authorized official
document No.399/CP-CN dated April 20, 1999 by the Prime Minister. The RAP for Phase I
comprised of two Parts: Part I of the RAP contained general procedures for preparation of
RAP; objectives and principles of resettlement policy; compensation entitlements; legal
framework; institutional arrangements; public participation and consultation framework;
grievance procedures; and external and internal monitoring. Part II of the RAP covered project
specific components and adverse social impacts, results of the socio-economic and detailed
measurement surveys, entitlement policy compensation matrix, estimated costs and budget
and implementation schedule for the sanitation components.
The RAP for the Project is prepared within the scope of the resettlement policy framework
presented in Part I of the Phase I RAP. The RAP, without repeating the provisions of the
Policy, will only cover a) project components and impacts; b) compensation entitlement policy;
c) costs and budgets; and d) implementation arrangements.

Danang Sanitation Project - Additional Works            Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
2 PROJECT COMPONENTS AND IMPACTS
2.1 Project Objectives
Following the Decision by the Danang Peoples' Committee and No Objection Letter dated
August 12, 2002 by the World Bank, the Prime Minister issued the Decision No. 1473 /CP-
QHQT dated 18 November 2002 agreeing to the use of savings for the additional works under
the Project.
Due to savings achieved during the Phase l's bidding process, there is about 11 million US$ of
funds available for continued development of sanitation works. The primary sanitation priority
is drainage works in areas that were not serviced by Phase I activities. Drainage works will
consume about 80% of the entire Project budget. The secondary sanitation priority is for the
further provision of some wastewater works in areas that were not serviced by Phase I. The
project will also fund minor services and goods such as beach cleaning equipment and covers
for wastewater treatment plants. These are intended to reduce environmental impacts created
by Danang's growing domestic and commercial sectors.
In general, the objectives of the additional works in the project include:
1. Reduced impacts of flooding;
2. Extension of wastewater collection in economic and residential areas; and
3. Upgrading of wastewater treatment plants resulting in improved environment and
human health.
2.2 Project Components
Description of Drainage and Wastewater components is summarized below
2.2.1 Proposed Drainage Works
The proposed Drainage Works comprises of 5 components. Brief description of these
components, location and design parameters are presented in Table 2-1 and shown in Figure
2-1. The likely impacts of the components and emerging issues are summarized below.

c. Drain Size: 2.0 x 1.5m - 4.4 x 1.4m (b x h)
04.  An Khe Drain        a. To increase drainage capacity to evacuate storm water from the
From An Khe pond to    valley in An Khe ward south and east of the railway; the valley is
Phu Loc River         to be back filled and further developed into a residential area. The
drain is about 550m long.
b. Drain Depth: 2.2 - 2.8m
c. Drain Size: 8.0 x 2.0m (b x h)
05.  My Khe Drain        a. To increase drainage capacity to evacuate storm water from the

Me An                  Street; the area is to be back filled and further developed into a
residential area. The total length of the drain is about 3290m.
b. Drain Depth: 2.2 - 4.1m
d. Drain Size: 4.0 x 1.5m - 7.5 x 2.Om (b x h)
Le Do Drain
The proposed drain from Dien Bien Phu Street to Danang Bay is about 1,044m long. The
section between Dien Bien Phu Street to Tran Cao Van Road is about 800m and the drain is
proposed within the existing ROW. The proposed drain for this section will not result in any
loss of private assets although during the construction phase some temporary impacts such
as: inconvenience to road users, restricted access to existing shops and businesses may be
expected.
The drain section between the Tran Cao Van Road to Danang Bay is about 170 m long and is
proposed within the 20.5 m, including road and footpath, proposed road. Since the proposed
road will result in many existing remaining structures of irregular shape, the Danang Peoples'
Committee has proposed additional 20m on either side of the road and additional 3m wide
lane to provide access to the remaining properties to be included in the project for
redevelopment of the area. The objective to redevelop these areas is to regularize structures
and land holdings. The strategy is to first vacate these areas for redevelopment and sell
redeveloped plots to people, with priority given to the displaced PAPs. In any case, the
alignment of the proposed drain depends on the land acquisition for the road and
redevelopment of the adjoining areas, and particularly because the construction of the drain is
to begin relatively soon, the RAP would cover the impacts caused by the proposed road and
the redevelopment plan. The resettlement and compensation policy for the project will also
apply to the households affected by the road and the adjoining areas designated for
redevelopment.

Danang Sanitation Project - Additional Works          Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
Le Dinh Tham Drain
Total length of the drain is about 610 m. About 200m will be along the main road and will have
no impacts on private assets. The remaining section of about 450 m will be within the existing
narrow alley. A corridor of impact will be about 3.0 in width. The proposed drain will affect
several households due to the loss of residential land but only marginally. In most cases
boundary walls and fences would be affected. The proposed drainage works will not cause
any displacement of any PAPs. Additionally, several electric poles would be affected.
Temporary impacts during construction is also expected in terms of restricted access to all the
houses in the alley, and damage to existing structures and boundary walls.
Xuan Hoa Drain
The proposed drain is about 1.2 km long. The corridor of impact between the road and the
railway line of about 3.Om and from there up to Phu Loc river is about 4m. The alignment
generally follows the existing natural drain. However, along the first section there are
structures on both sides of the existing drain but none of them is likely to be affected
permanently. Some temporary damage to these structures may be expected during
implementation. Appropriate compensation would have to be paid in case of any damage to
the structures. Several structures are protruding over the existing open drain at the
downstream end of the proposed drain. All of these are illegal extension of existing structures.
Several households are currently using the government land for cultivation of fruits and
vegetables. They would be affected due to the loss of incomes.
An Khe Drain
The alignment of the drain follows existing natural drain that generally passes thru open areas.
No structures will be affected but several households would be affected due to the loss of use
of agricultural land. The drain corridor will be about 8m in width. Impacts during construction
may be in the form of access road for heavy machinery.
My Khe Drain
The alignment of the proposed drains generally follows the proposed road system. The initial
part of the proposed road will impact a large number of existing structures. Therefore, to
minimize impacts of the drain, the alignment of the proposed drains is now modified at several
places to minimize resettlement. The corridor of impact of the drains is about 4 meters at the
northern most section and about 6 meters at the southern end. Several structures, including
businesses, will be affected especially where the proposed drains cross the existing roads. For
most parts, the drains follow the proposed roads, especially where the proposed roads cross
thru open areas without affecting any structures. Land acquisition activities for the roads have
not begun and are likely to be completed by the end of 2003. The RAP for this component will
cover the corridor of impact for the drains where the drains are planned independently. RAP
will not cover any drainage section that follows the planned roads.
2.2.2 Proposed Wastewater Works
The Phase I project will support the development of a separate wastewater system in each of
four wastewater catchments in Danang - Phu Loc, Hoa Cuong, Son Tra, and Ngu Hanh Son).
Each catchment will thus be provided with a wastewater collection system, generally located
near outfalls where dry weather flows of wastewater will be diverted from storm water drains,
and a wastewater treatment plant. The Hoa Cuong and Phu Loc systems are large systems,
catering for the "old" city of Danang, while those at Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son, East of the
Hanh River, are much smaller. The wastewater components of the project will not cause any
adverse impact on private assets: land, structures, trees and crops or any other fixed assets.

Danang Sanitation Project - Additional Works          Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
2.3 Socio-economic Characteristics of Project Affected Persons
Census, inventory and socio-economic survey for the five components of the project was
carried out between April - June 2003, with the effective assistance provided by DNPC, PMU,
local authorities and URENCO. The socio-economic survey covered all the components with
the exception of An Khe drainage. The An Khe drainage will not affected any private assets.
The socio-economic surveys were conducted by two experienced teams from the Danang
Drainage and Sanitation Project Management Unit. The teams interviewed project affected
households. In addition, key officials from the relevant People's Committees were also
interviewed to obtain any key issues relevant to the areas. Furthermore, officials in charge of
land from local agencies (districts and wards) affected by the extended project also were
mobilized to support the survey teams in defining the affected households and their address
as well as the data related to project affected households.
During the interview process, questionnaires were either completed at the survey time or
distributed for later completion due to absence of owner's households. All survey results are
authenticated by the ward authorities and the questionnaire forms were signed by the PAPs to
indicate their agreement with the stated losses. In some cases, public meetings were arranged
by the peoples' committees to assist collection of related survey data from affected
households. The sample questionnaire is included as Annex A.
2.3.1 Socio-economic Surveys
The Socio-economic survey covered 143 PAPs out of a total of 187 PAPs for the five
components. The details are shown in the following table.

2.3.2 Household Characteristics
Since socio-economic information for the 32 PAPs for the An Khe drainage was not collected,
just data of land and status of land, the household characteristics for the remaining four
components is presented below, representing a total of 143 household or 839 persons.
Summary of socio-economic characteristics for the surveyed PAPs is presented in Table 2-2.
Household Size
Average household size of the PAPs in the four sub-project areas is 5.8. 10.5 % of all the
PAPs has a household size of less than four persons. &1.3 % of the PAPs have a household
size between 4 to 8 persons and the remaining 18.2% household are with more than 8
members.
Gender
The ration of male to female in the four drainage areas is 51.8:48.2. There is a predominance
of male population in the project area reflecting the general pattern of the city as a whole.

Education
The education level of surveyed households is given in the Table 2-2. Out of a total of 506
people, 133 (26.2%) have attained or are currently having primary school education. The
number and percentage of people with secondary and high school education are 148 (29.3%)
and 162 (32.1%) respectively. A total of 63 persons (12.4%) have attained college or university
education.
Occupation
According to the survey results, most of the households are either salaried persons working in
government departments (42.1%) or in business and commerce (37.8%). A small number of
households also earn their living by fishina (9.8%) or through agricultural activities (9.8%).
Being close to the bay, most of the households among this category come from Le Do area.
The pattern is similar when a comparison is made between the households in the four
8



Danang Sanitation Project - Additional Works          Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
components. This is because all the four components are undertaken in the urban areas and
most of then households either live within the urban area or close to it.
Household Incomes
Majority (50.3%) of the surveyed households have an average monthly household incomes
ranging between one to 2 million VND. The percentage of those earning below one million
VND is 32.2%. These households can be considered as poor households. 25 households or
17.5%, have an average monthly household income of more than 2 million VND. Most of these
come from the Le Do area.
Perception of the PAPs about the Proiect
As expected, all the surveyed households have shown full agreement with the project
objectives and are aware of the potential benefits that it will bring to the society in general and
to the people within the project areas in particular.
2.4 Project Impacts
2.4.1 Steps taken to minimize impacts
Initial reconnaissance of the proposed alignment of drains and the roads helped in
identification of potential areas with major resettlement impacts. In order to minimize adverse
impacts minor modifications and alignment were made. This is particularly apparent in the case
of My Khe area where a new drainage alignment is proposed because the proposed road is
likely to impact a much larger number of households and structures. In Le Dinh Tham minor
changes in alignment helped in minimizing impacts on structures. Where possible, minor
modifications in the design of drains were also made to minimize impacts on existing
structures. This is particularly the case in Le Dinh Tham and Xuan Hoa.
The project will affect a total of 187 PAPs. Except for the Le Do area, other components will
result only marginal impacts on the PAPs. In Le do the major impact is due to the proposed
road and the 23m (20m for plots and 3 m for lane) wide adjoining areas on both sides of the
road designated for redevelopment. The urban redevelopment of the area, including the road,
will affect a total of 102 households, 90 of them severely. Reportedly, the developed plots will
be sold to people, with priority given to the PAPs, at a higher price. The development plan of
the area is being prepared by the DNPC. Based on the census and inventory of affected
assets, direct permanent impacts on the households were identified. The summary of inventory
forms for each of the five areas is presented in Annex B. The impacts are summarized below:
2.4.2 Impacts on Land
A total of 174 PAPs would be affected due to the loss of agricultural and residential land. The
description of impacts by the type of land is as follows.
Loss of Agricultural Land
The project will impact a total of 40 PAPs due to the loss of agricultural land. Most of these
PAPs (32 Households) are in the An Khe area. Only four of the 32 PAPs affected in An Khe
area own the affected land. The remaining 28 PAPs have the affected land on lease from the
ward. In My Khe area a total of 8 PAPs will be affected by the loss of agricultural land of these
only 2 PAPs own the affected land. The remaining 6 PAPs have the affected land on lease
from the ward authorities. Total land that will need to be acquired totals 588 m2. Additionally,
2,526 m2 of ward land that is on lease will need to be repossessed for the project. Through the
surveys, among 40 households affected by agricultural land, there are 15 households affected
more than 20 % of their land holding in which 12 households in An Khe and 3 households in
My Khe. And other 25 households affected less than 20 %.

Danang Sanitation Project - Additional Works              Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
Loss of Residential Land
A total of 134 PAPs would be affected due to the loss of 11,978.5 m2 of residential land of
which 102 PAPs (10,364.5 m2) are affected due to the urban redevelopment project in Le Do
area. Of these 90 PAPs would be affected due to the loss of their entire land holdings (8,428.7
m2) while 12 PAPs will be affected due to the partial loss of residential land. In Le Dinh Tham,
13 PAPs (69.5 m2) will be affected by partial loss of residential land. The corresponding
number in My Khe is 19 PAPs with 1,544.5 m2.
2.4.3 Impacts on Structures
The project will impact a total of 110 PAPs due to the loss of structures. The total area of the
affected structures is 7,312.9 m2, taking into account all the floors. The distribution of PAPs
affected by the loss of structures and by degree of impacts, partial or entire loss is shown in
Table 2-3.
The compensation rates for affected structures vary with the quality of structures. The quality
of the function of the types of construction and building material used. DNPC have established
4 standard categories for classification of structures based on the quality with category one as
the best quality. Structures built with temporary building material and in the poor condition are
considered temporary. Based on the type of construction material and building conditions,
affected structures were identified by categories (Table 2-3). Only one structure is of category
one. Most of the affected structures fall into category 4.  Four, out of the 110 affected
structures are temporary in nature.
Only three affected structures in Le Do and another one house in Le Dinh Tham are with three
floors. Another 13 houses are double-floor structures. All the other remaining structures are
single-floor structures.
2.4.4 Loss of other Fixed Assets
A total of 75 PAPs, most of them in the Le Do area, will be affected by the loss of boundary
walls. 29 PAPs will be affected by the loss of fences. Additionally, the loss of paved yards will
impact a total of 78 PAPs, again most of them in the Le Do area. 4 PAPs in An Khe area
would be affected by the loss of fish-ponds (214 m2) and would be entitled to compensation
for the same.

(7,089.5)  (13.5)     (27.2)    (183.0)           (7,312.9)
2.4.5 Loss of Trees and Crops
A total of 24 PAPs would be affected due to the loss of trees, most of them in the Le Do area,
14 PAPs & 142 trees. This is followed by 9 PAPs in My Khe with a loss of 132 trees, and 1 PAP
in Xuan Hoa with a loss of 20 trees.
PAPs affected by the loss of agricultural land, 40 PAPs, and another three PAPs in Xuan Hoa
cultivating ward land without any legal permission or use rights would be affected by the project.
However, all these PAPs would be given sufficient time to harvest their crops. Therefore, the
project will not impact their crops. However, 4 PAPs in An Khe area are also using their leased
agricultural land as fish-ponds. The impact of the project will be marginal for these PAPs as
they may be marginally affected in their source of income and livelihood.
2.4.6 Loss of Incomes and Businesses
Loss of agricultural income
A total of 40 PAPs would be affected due to the loss of incomes from cultivation of agricultural
land. These include 6 PAPs who own the land (588.0 m2), 34 PAPs who lease the ward land
(2,526 m2). Four of these PAPs in An Khe have converted part of their leased agricultural land
into fish-ponds. There are three households in Xuan Hoa area who are temporarily using the
planned land (72 m2) of DNPC to grow some crop while this land is vacant with the condition
that they will harvest and clear it once the city requests. Now the PMU and local authority have
already informed these households of the project and given them a time to harvest what they
are temporarily growing on the planned land. Therefore these households will not lose any thing
and they are not considered as PAPs.
As memtioned before, 15 Households affected with more than 15% of their agricultural land, will
not be affected much for their income from agriculture. Because agricultural crops are just their
extra source of income.
Loss of Business Incomes
A total of 12 PAPs use part of their houses as shops or for other commercial activities. The
project will result in the loss of such businesses and household incomes. Seven of these PAPs
are in Le Do area, 1 PAP in Xuan Hoa, and 4 PAPs in Me Khe area.
2.4.7 Impacts on Public Infrastructure and Utilities
The proposed drainage and associated road development will cause extensive impact on
existing public utilities such as: electric poles, power distribution lines, road side pavements,
existing drains etc. In accordance with the policy, all impacted public facilities and utilities will be
made good and the DNPC will ensure repairs and rehabilitation of all affected infrastructures.

2.4.8 Temporary Impacts
Construction works implementation of extended project will have temporary impacts on a
number of roadside businesses, houses and other establishments. The impacts would be
mainly the restricted access and inconvenience during the project implementation. There may
some minor impacts on the boundary walls, fences and other fixed assets during the
construction phase.
The summary of impacts by each of the project components and consolidated impact summary

3 COMPENSATION ENTITLEMENT POLICY
Based on the detailed measurement surveys, the types of impacts and category of PAPs were
identified. These are described in the following sections. All references to categories in the
following section are from the Entitlements Matrix. Where the term marginally affected is used,
it refers to marginal losses (less than 20% of landholding) to affected assets without any need
for acquisition of entire asset or relocation.
3.1 Permanent losses
3.1.1 Loss of Arable land
A total of 40 households are affected due to the loss of agricultural land. Of these only 6 PAPs
have permanent land use rights for the affected land. The remaining 34 PAPs have leased the
land from respective wards. Four out of the 34 PAPs also use part of the land as fish-ponds.
Hence, all the 6 PAPs with land use rights will be entitled to compensation in cash at 100% of
the replacement cost of the affected land and another 34 PAPs will be entitled to compensation
at 30% of replacement cost OR compensation for the loss of incomes for the remaining of their

Danang Sanitation Project - Additional Works           Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
residential land without any impact on structures. The remaining 7 PAPs are affected by partial
loss of residential land as well as houses, with remaining land and houses viable for continued
use.
All the 134 affected households (both marginally and severely affected) have permanent land
use rights and permits for the land. These PAPs will be entitled to compensation at 100% of
replacement cost.
3.1.3 Loss of Structures
A total of 110 PAPs are affected by the loss of structures, partially or severely. Of these, 20
PAPs are affected by only partial loss of their structures. Remaining structures are viable for
continued use. Out of the 20 partially affected structures, 15 structures are legal with permits

compensation for affected part at replacement cost plus repair allowance for rehabilitation of
their remaining structures. PAPs with the five illegal structures, 4 in Xuan Hoa and one in My
Khe, do not have permit for construction. They will be entitled to compensation for affected
area at 60% of replacement cost plus an allowance for repair of the remaining structures.
The remaining 90 PAPs are affected severely and all of these are in the Le Do area affected
due to the proposed road and redevelopment of the area. All these PAPs will be entitled to
compensation for entire areas of affected structures at replacement cost without any
depreciation or deductions for salvaged material. Additionally, these PAPs will be entitled to
relocation and other assistance in accordance with the policy provisions.
Of the total of 110 affected houses, 12 houses also have small shops in front. Six of these will
be affected partially due to the project. These PAPs will also be entitled to compensation for
loss of incomes for only the transition period. The remaining 6 PAPs affected by the loss of
shops are in the Le Do area and among the 90 PAPs severely affected by entire loss of
houses in Le Do area.

Danang Sanitation Project - Additional Works         Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
The main source of income of households affected by the extended Project is hired
employment, agriculture, fishing, and house rental. Several households with structures
affected also have small home-based businesses. In some cases, relocation to new areas also
affects household's life earning or incomes. Because the new relocation is far from places
where they make a living, they have to leave their career. Therefore, allowance entitlement is
necessary to them to restore their incomes or living standards.
All the PAPs affected by the loss of businesses would be provided with economic rehabilitation
assistance that may include, but not limited to, training in alternative skills, employment
opportunities and other suitable means of economic rehabilitation depending upon the needs
and priorities of the households.
The analysis of the data collected on the types of impacts showed that there are 12 PAPs
affected by severe impacts on their incomes. These include 7 PAPs having businesses in the
Le Do area that will have their source of income seriously disrupted. Other 5 PAPs in My Khe
and Xuan Ha. However they will be given priorities to choose the sites for relocation in front of
the road so that they could continue their business after the project. These PAPs will be
provided with allowance for the lost income of 100 USD per household.
Similarly, 15 PAPs affected more than 20% of their agricultural land holding will be entitled to
agricultural rehabilitation allowance for income restoration of 1.0 million VND per household.

their choice of location) will be granted a cash allowance of 5 Million VND including
transportation costs to the new areas by the DNPC. The allowance helps the located
households to resettle in the new locations.
Through the survey, all relocated households require DNPC to provide with land plots on the
resettlement sites. Accordingly, all the 90 relocating PAPs in Le Do will be entitled to the
relocation allowance as transportation cost of 1 million VND.
3.3.2 Life stability Allowance
Each person permanently registered in each relocating households and partly affected
households (with structure partly affected ) will be entitled to the life stability allowance for the

Each PAP affected by temporary impacts, causing loss of customers or part of incomes
(irrespective of the extent) will be entitled to compensation paid in cash equivalent to value of
10 USD per month during the period of such impact up to a maximum of one year.
3.5 Relocation Requirements
Out of the 187 PAPs affected by the project, only 90 PAPs will be displaced requiring
relocation. All these PAPs are affected by the proposed road and redevelopment of Le Do area.
In addition to the 90 PAPs requiring relocation, another 20 PAPs would be marginally affected
due to the loss of residential land, houses and other fixed assets, trees, businesses and
incomes. The impacts of all the affected 187 PAPs have been identified and their entitlements
to compensation, allowances and other assistance have been determined in accordance with
the policy, and included in the RAP.
The DNPC proposes to develop the vacated area and provide plots of regular size (4.5x20m)
and sell them to people, with priority given to the PAPs. The selling price is tentatively fixed at
VND 3.0 million/m2 whereas the current compensation rate for residential land in the area
varies between 0.5 for land behind the main road, to VND 3.6 million/m2 for plots facing he
main road. Further, after the redevelopment only a maximum of 68 plots can be planned in the
area. Therefore, the remaining 22 PAPs are to be relocated at a newly developed area in
Thanh Loc Dan. At Thanh Loc Dan the selling price of the plots of similar size is between VND
1.0-1.5 million per m2. The plan of the Le Do area showing existing structures and proposed
road and the redevelopment area, as well as the site relocation plan for the Thanh Loc Dan is
attached with this RAP as Annex D.
Since the developed plots at Le Do and Thanh Loc Dan area are to be sold to people, the PAPs
have the choice to either buy the developed plots from DNPC from the compensation
entitlements or settle themselves anywhere at their choice of location. In addition, For
households, they have convenient locations for business before being affected by the project,

they will be given priority to choose suitable locations for business when they are allocated
land plots in the resettlement areas by DNPC.
In addition, through the socio - econo survey, all relocating PAPs are satisfied with the two
proposed resettlement sites by DNPC, because this existing area is in bad condition of
infrastructure and utilities. There are no water and electricity supplies. In rainy seasons, this
area is always flooded and very bad condition of environment.
The proposed resettlement sites of Le Do is only from 5 to 7 km far from Thanh Loc Dan
resettlement site. These two proposed sites are rather near the Danang Bay, therefore, fishing
households will not be affected much for their source of income or livelihood due to relocation.

4 COSTS AND BUDGET
The resettlement cost for the project will be part of the project cost and will be covered out of
the project. The resettlement has been estimated based on the entitlements for each category
of PAPs covered in the entitlement matrix in Chapter 3. All resettlement cost in the project will
be covered out of the funds provided by DNPC and necessary budget has been allocated for
the purpose.
4.1 Procedures for Flows of Funds
URENCO will disburse the land acquisition, allowances and resettlement funds of the
extension of Danang drainage and sanitation project through Municipal Site Clearance &
Compensation Board. The Board will pay directly to the PAPs affected by the project.
4.2 Unit Prices
The    resettlement cost in        the  project is estimated        based     on  the   compensation       rates   and
allowances established by the DNPC. These compensation rates and allowances are
established based on the following decisions of the DNPC:

5 IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
5.1 Approval of RAP for the Project
The RAP for the Extension of Danang Drainage and Sanitation Project is prepared within the
overall framework of the RAP for the Phase I of the project. Therefore, the resettlement policy
provisions including objectives, compensation and entitlement principles, allowances and other
assistance, legal framework, institutional set-up, resettlement implementation procedures,
public consultation and community participation as well as internal and external monitoring will
be the same as in the RAP for the Phase I of the project. The RAP for the extension works will
be presented to the (DNPC) Government of Vietnam and the World Bank for approval before
implementation. Once approved, the RAP will become legally enforceable and the DNPC and
URENCO will proceed with its implementation.
5.2 Establishment of the Resettlement Committee.
According to the project agreement, the resettlement committee was established to implement
the resettlement action plan of the project (phase 1). The resettlement committee was
established on the basis of members from DNPC, Department of Land Administration,
Department of Finance and Priced materials and Municipal Compensation & Site Clearance
Board and chairmen of people's committee of wards enjoying the project and URENCO. They
all were in charge of the RAP implementation.
For the implementation of RAP for this extension of the Danang Drainage and Sanitation
Project the above mentioned resettlement committee would also be fully in charge.
5.3 Training of the Resettlement Committee
During the implementation of RAP of Danang drainage and sanitation project (phase 1), some
key staffs from URENCO were trained by the WB for planning and implementation of RAP
policies and implementation procedures, they are members of resettlement committee of the
project. The staff has now achieved sufficient experience in RAP implementation and good
knowledge of resettlement implementation procedures as required by the RAP. No further
training of the staff is therefore envisaged.
5.4 Establishment of Compensation Rates and Allowances
The Danang people's Committee (DNPC) will determine the rates of compensation payable for
land, structures and other assets as well as allowance entitlements to all PAPs. These rates
have to be established before compensation and allowance entitlements can be calculated and
implemented. Several of the Decisions, summarized below, are updated to ensure that they
reflect current market rates and become effective as of January 1, 2003.

Danang Sanitation Project - Additional Works         Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
The legal bases for compensation for land in Danang city are as follows:
- Decision No. 140/2002/ QD-UB dated 18/12/2002 by the DNPC for the issuance of
regulations of prices for land categories in Danang city. The rates are effective as of
January 1, 2003.
- Decision No. 141/2002/ QD-UB dated 18/12/2002 by the DNPC for the issuance of
regulations of compensation, allowances and resettlement when the Government acquires
land in Danang city. The rates are effective as of January 1, 2003.
- Decision No. 60/2003/ QD-UB dated 26/3/2003 by the DNPC for adjustment of 23 Article of
Decision 141/2002/QD-UB dated 18/12/2002 about job transfer support towards labor of
agricultural production.
Furthermore, the DNPC would take into consideration the fact that the entitlements for
compensation, allowances and other assistance would be in accordance to the provisions of the
policy in the project.
5.5 Conducting Public Information Campaign and PAP consultations
When the feasibility study of Danang drainage and sanitation project are approved by the
Government of Vietnam and the World Bank, a public information campaign will be carried to
inform the PAPs about the updated compensation rates, precise impacts on their assets,
entitlements, and implementation schedule. Displaced PAPs would be consulted on an ongoing
basis to keep them appraised on the relocation schedule and the locations of resettlement
site(s).
Direct contacts to affected people and mass - media for project information will be carried out
for public information campaigns. Furthermore, The resettlement committee will develop a
campaign to disseminate frequent information about the project to the PAPs and the general
public in the project areas. This campaign will begin as soon as the project is approved.
In order to facilitate the RAP implementation, the PMU and local authorities will undertake the
public information campaign as well as PAP consultations. The objectives of the public
information campaign and PAP consultation program are as follows:
- to share fully information about the project sites, its components and its activities with the
PAP.
- to obtain information about the needs and priorities of the PAP as well as information about
their reactions to proposed policies and activities.
- to obtain the cooperation and participation of the PAP and communities in activities required
to be undertaken for resettlement planning and implementation.
- to ensure transparency in all activities related to land acquisition, resettlement and
rehabilitation.
5.6 Procedure for Compensation and Other Entitlement of PAPs
For Danang drainage and Sanitation Project (also for the extended project), DNPC has
appointed the Municipal site Clearance and Compensation Board to carry out all activities of
compensation and resettlement for PAPs with support of Danang Department of Finance and
Material Pricing.
Based on DNPC's decisions, after investigation, measurement and calculation for affected
levels, the Municipal Site Clearance and Compensation Board and Department of Finance and
Material Pricing will update unit prices for compensations and allowance entitlement for PAPs
and after the unit prices are updated, the resettlement committee will apply the prices to each
28



Danang Sanitation Project - Additional Works         Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
PAP's losses, calculate the compensation entitlement and complete the assets compensation
forms for each affected household.
All PAPs will be informed of their compensation entitlement by posting this information at the
local ward office. In addition, the PAPs will receive a written document of:
a) The compensation rates.
b) The compensation amounts.
c) The schedule for.compensation and
d) The kinds of compensations the PAP will receive. The option to appeal the
compensation will also be explained clearly to the PAPs.
Besides, PAPs can ask DNPC to consider further and support them, if they are not satisfied
with the compensation and allowances and resettlement. If there are any grievances or
complaints they will be resolved following the mechanism explained later in this chapter.
5.7 Linkage Between Resettlement and Civil Works
Payment of compensation, allowances and other assistance to the PAPs will be completed at
least one month prior to their displacement from their present location. Demolition and
rebuilding of the structures and clearance of sites on the project areas would be completed at
least one month before URENCO hands over the cleared project sites to the contractors for
construction.
The planning and implementation of compensation site clearance and resettlement will be
established closely according to the construction schedule. Resettlement activities and civil
works in the project are an integral part of the project and sufficient care would be taken to
ensure that these activities are well coordinated. The following activities will be completed
before the start of construction activities:
-  Payment of all compensation for land, houses and other structures and assets
including the crops and trees and delivery of allowances to the PAPs.
-  Reorganization of all PAPs (relocation & measures for living stability)
- Clearance of crops and trees at the proposed project sites.
5.8 Monitoring of Resettlement Activities
The PMU for the Drainage and Sanitation project will be responsible for internal monitoring and
supervision of resettlement activities in the project. The PMU will carry on internal monitoring
as an ongoing activity and will submit quarterly monitoring reports to the DNPC and the WB.
Internal monitoring activities will begin as soon as the project is approved and the
implementation activities have started.
As required, an experienced external-monitoring agency will be contracted for external
monitoring of resettlement implementation in the project. The external monitoring agency will
regularly monitor the key indicators in the project including: assessment of compensation,
compliance with the provisions of the RAP, payment procedures for compensation and other
allowances, grievance redress mechanism, effectiveness of public consultation process, etc.,
and submit external monitoring reports to PMU and that forwards to the DNPC and the WB
every quarterly.
For Danang drainage and sanitation project, The Center for Rural-Urban Planning &
Development of mid-region Vietnam was selected to carry out the external monitoring activities
29



Danang Sanitation Project - Additional Works         Resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
of resettlement action plan. The center has a good cooperation with the PMU and has been
carrying out extemal monitoring activities for Phase I project to the satisfaction of the WB. The
same agency would be selected for external monitoring in the project.
5.9 Mechanisms for Grievance Redress
During the implementation of project site clearance & compensation, All PAPs have the rights
to make any complaints and their complaints will be solved if the measurement & calculation,
assessment, price applications and resettlement are not consistent with the regulations as
followed:
Step 1: If any person who is aggrieved by any aspects of compensation and resettlement, that
person can submit a written grievance directly to ward PC and URENCO (Drainage and
sanitation project management unit - PMU). PMU shall work with municipal relevant authorities
in order to process the grievance. In common, the grievance shall be processed within 15
days.
Step 2: If the person making the complaint is not satisfied with the decision or the person
receives no response within 15 days of registering the grievance, that person can submit the
complaint to the District People's Committee or to the Municipal Site Clearance &
Compensation Board to process the complaint within 15 days from the day they receive
compensation decision.
Step 3: If the person making the complaint is not satisfied with the decision or the person
receives no response within 15 days of registering the grievance. If the second attempt at
reconciliation fails, the case can be directly submitted to the Danang People's committee,
which shall process and make the decision on the matter within 30 days.
Step 4: If all the above- mentioned attempts are not successful, the case will be submitted to
the district court for further appeal.
PAP will be exempt from all administrative and legal fees. Complaints to the court will also
have the right of free legal representation. The detailed procedures for redressal of grievances
and the appeals process will be widely publicized among the PAP.
All records of complaints and grievances and measures taken to address grievance will be
maintained at People's committee of ward and in URENCO's office.
