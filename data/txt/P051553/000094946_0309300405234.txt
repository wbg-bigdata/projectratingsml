Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project                         Additional Works Program
Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                       Detailed Design Report
Summary
1. Introduction
The construction of Phase I of Danang Drainage and Sanitation Project covering Danang's five
urban districts is currently underway and is expected to bring substantial net benefits to Danang
city. Due to the savings generated through Phase I's bidding process, about 11 USD million of
additional drainage and wastewater works (hereafter known as the Additional Works Project) have
been approved both by World Bank (in Aide Memoire of April 2, 2002) and Danang Peoples'
Committee (in Decision No 1450/VP of April 11, 2002).
2. Scope
The majority of Additional Works Project funds will be used to support drainage works.
Wastewater works are the Project's second budgetary priority, and beach cleaning is a tertiary
priority. Detailed engineering and supervision of the additional works construction are included in
the scope of the Additional Works. The table below shows the main features of the Additional
Works scope, including their estimated base costs.

3. Drainage
All drains consist of simple box culverts. In most cases, as they drains are large, they consist of
double or triple box culverts, to avoid too large a span. To concentrate dry weather flows, one
section of each culvert is provided with a V-shaped floor.
Foundation of the culverts on Danang soils is generally no problem. However, the Xuan Hoa drain
and the An Khe drain are mostly located in existing river beds while a small part of the My Khe
drain is located in a swamp. Geotechnical investigations have revealed that in some locations, mud
deposits have to be removed and the Bills of Quantities provide for this.
4. Additions to the Wastewater collection systems
The city administration has seen the need for wastewater removal and treatment and has earmarked
some residential areas in the Hoa Cuong, Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son catchment areas to be
provided with wastewater systems.
In the Hoa Cuong area, the replacement of a long rising main to the WWTP by a combination of
Gravity Interceptor Drains (GID) and shorter rising mains, as well as a rerouting along the river
provided for the required additional system, at negligible costs.
In the Son Tra area, the city had planned to add an independent wastewater system to serve the
additional areas. It turned out that integrating the added system with the system planned before
would lead to cost savings and a higher flexibility.

Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project                      Additional Works Program
Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                    Detailed Design Report
The wastewater system for Ngu Hanh Son is closely related to the My Khe drain to be constructed
as part of the Additional Works program. A completely new system was required, therefore, in
comparison to the system design for the ongoing Phase I project. It was decided to remove the
complete system from the ongoing contract 013 and ad it to a new package 020.
5. Floating covers
Floating covers will be provided for the two large treatment plants (at Hoa Cuong and Phu Loc),
presently under construction. To minimize the costs, it was previously decided to omit such
floating covers for the two smaller plants at Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son. However, they were
always desired and, with the budget not yet exhausted, they were now added to the Additional
Works. The best is to have floating covers installed while lagoons are empty and it is
recommended to procure the covers as soon as possible, through a variation to contract 012.
6. Beach cleaning equipment
Two small self-propelled beach cleaners were delivered in April 2003.
7. EIA and RAP
As part of the detailed engineering study, an EIA, EMP and RAP were prepared and submitted to
the World Bank for approval. Most of the project components are hardly affected by resettlement,
except the Le Do drain, where over a section of 250m, out of its total length of 1200m,
considerable resettlement will be required.
8. Procurement Plan
The procurement plan for the Additional Works is complicated and simple at the same time. It is
complicated as a. large number of Additional Works project components are shifted to ongoing
contracts througlh addendum or variation orders, while parts of the Phase 1 defined project will be
shifted to a new civil works package, 020. It is simple as only two new contract packages are
proposed.
Most of the Additional Works should be procured under new package 020. This applies to all
drainage works, except the Le Do drain. Its construction is urgent and it is proposed to ad this
work to existing contract 013.
For the additional wastewater systems the situation is more diverse. The Hoa Cuong system hardly
includes new items and works should be executed under the existing contract 013. The additions to
the Son Tra wastewater system are very much integrated with the already contracted works and are
best procured through a variation to contract 013. However, the complete Ngu Hanh Son system
will be lifted from contract 013 and moved to contract 020. This compensates somewhat the
variations made to this contract for the Le Do drain and the Son Tra wastewater system additions.
Floating covers for the two small treatment plants are best procured under variation to ongoing
contract 012.
Two self-propelled beach cleaners were procured already under a small (national Shopping)
contract 016, while detailed engineering was procured under an Addendum to ongoing contract
011 (for Construction Management Services).

The resulting procurement proposal is presented in the table below. Contracts 011, 012 and 0 13 are
ongoing contracts, contract 016 was prepared especially for the beach cleaners and has been
concluded already, while package 020 will contain the bulk of the Additional Works.
Tender documents for package 020 were prepared as part of the detailed engineering study.

9. Costs
Costs were calculated as base costs and as total costs. The difference is largest for the work items
to be procured under package 020, as additions are made for costs of general and preliminary
items, physical and price contingencies. An overview is shown in the table below.
Contract            Base costs  Total costs

The additional works will have a significant impact on the contributions to the project by the
World Bank and by the project owner URENCO.
As, apart from the additional works, there had been already many alterations to contract scope of
012 and 013, a complete new cost estimate for the project was made. The table below shows the
most important details.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Danang is Vietnam's fourth largest city and is located along the coast mid way between Hanoi in
the north and Ho Chi Minh City in the south. The city covers an area of 6,671 hectares and its
1999 population was estimated at 684,000 (a figure which is expected to grow to 904,000 by the
year 2010). The population density is high: in some areas near to 600 persons per hectare.
Increased industrial development and tourism are targeted for the city's economic growth and both
require effective and efficient urban infrastructure. The existing sanitary facilities, however, are
totally inadequate. Regular flooding hampers the economic development and contributes to poor
health conditions in the town. Also untreated wastewater of the city discharges directly to the Han
River, the Danang Bay or the sea in the east.
The City of Danang has embarked on an ambitious program to improve the living condition of its
citizens. Through funding by of the Australian Government a number of studies were prepared
with respect to the improvement of water supply and sanitation.
Following the completion of these master planning and feasibility studies, GHD-Kinhill from
Australia in co-operation with VIWASE from Hanoi prepared detailed designs and tender
documents for Sanitation works.
1.2 On Going Phase 1 Project
Following the planning and study stage, a credit towvards the cost of rehabilitation and expansion of
the sanitation systems in urban districts of- amongst others - Danang City was received from the
International Development Association (IDA) by the Government of Vietnam.
Phase 1 of the resulting sanitation project comprises:
*  Upgrading of the stormwater system
*  Collection and treatment of domestic and industrial wastewater
•  Improvement of the solid waste collection and disposal system
*  Institutional strengthening
*  A community education and awareness campaign
At the moment the construction works are ongoing under the supervision of CMC - Construction
Management Consultants, a joint venture of DHV Consultants from the Netherlands, CDM International
from the USA and VIWASE from Hanoi.
The construction project takes place in five urban districts of Danang city (see Figure 1-1 and
Figure 1-2 for the revised scope of works). The total investment of the project was estimated at
USD 41M. However, after having awarded all contracts, the total value of the contracts of the
Danang Sanitation Project was USD 30M, about USD 1 IM lower than estimated.

1.3 Additional Works Program
In a meeting in April 2002, the World Bank agreed that the savings from the ongoing Phase I
project could be used for expanding the scope of the Danang Sanitation project.
Under the direction of the Danang People Committee, the Danang Construction Planning
Institution prepared the Feasibility Study "Danang Extended Sanitation Project Using Saving After
Bidding" outlining how the finds should be used.
The identified items are:
1. Flood mitigation works in
a. Hai Chau and Thanh Khe Districts (drainage catchment A)
b. Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son Districts (drainage catchment B)
2. Extension of the wastewater collection system in
a. Hoa Cuong wastewater catchment
b. Son Tra wastewater catchment
c. Ngu Hanh Son wastewater catchment
3. Floating covers for Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son Wastewater Treatment Plants

2 DRAINAGE - GENERAL
2.1 Introduction
2.1.1 Existing system
Danang is a coastal city, with a land elevation of between 2-6m. Due to its proximity to the coast,
drainage of the city has generally been expedient.
At present, Danang drainage system has a combined stormwater and sewerage system; for
stormwater, domestic wastewater and industrial effluent. The total length of the drainage network
is about 120 km; most drains are made of pitched stone and concrete covers.
Some recently constructed drains are reinforced concrete pipes or concrete box culverts. The
drainage network is mainly located in the Hai Chau and Thanh Khe districts. Son Tra, Ngu Hanh
Son and Lien Chieu districts hardly have any drainage system except in some newly developed
residential areas. Drainage in these latter districts is generally by means of soakage and infiltration
into the soil, or as overland flows to nearby lakes, rivers, and the sea.
Most drains constructed before 1995 are inadequate; they are intended for local drainage only and
not for conveyance of stormwater from the hinterland. This lack of primary drainage network is
the cause of much local flooding. In addition, side entry pits have inadequate capacity because of
bad design/construction or blockage. Also, the drains themselves are often blocked by sand and
trash.
Flooding occurs in a number of city streets whenever there is heavy rain. Some areas are 1.5m
deep in floodwater for several days. Adverse impacts of flooding include traffic congestion;
property and construction work damage; loss of business and trading; environmental pollution; as
well as ocher social and health problems. Wastewater flows from households and, industries, which
are often discharged untreated, are also a serious threat to the health of the general public and to
the sea and river environment. In particular Danang Bay which has a beautiful beach close to the
city is so heavily polluted that it should not be used for recreation anymore.
In phase I of the Danang sanitation subproject, the drainage system is being upgraded and
enlarged to mitigate the risk of flooding in priority areas. At the same time gravity interceptor
drains, pump stations and wastewater treatment plants are being constructed to reduce the
discharge of untreated wastewater and improve the effluent quality discharged into the
environment.
Based on drainage flow directions, land topography, and available spot level survey information,
the study area can broadly be divided into 14 main catchments as follows (see Figure 2-0):
Catchment I: Dam Rong
This catchment is bounded by Danang Bay to the north, Ong Ich Khiem Street to the west, Le Loi
Street to the east and Con market to the south. The size of the catchment is 210 Ha. The population
is approximately 61,000 in 2000 and 71,000 in 2010. Major trunk drains in the catchment are the
Ong Ich Khiem Street drain and the Dam Rong Lake and channel system.
In phase 1 of Danang sanitation subproject, a new stormwater drain of 3.5-2x2.4m wide and 1.5m
deep has been constructed in Ong Ich Khiem Street to Danang Bay. The former drainage system
has been rehabilitated for wastewater drainage.
In phase I of the Danang sanitation subproject, wastewater discharging to Dam Rong-Lake I is to
be collected and transferred to the Phu Loc WWTP by SPS 18 to reduce pollution in this area.

population is approximately 20,000 in 2000 and 23,000 in 2010. Most of drains in this catchment
follow the direction from West to East to the Han River. These drains are on either side of the
road, each about 600-1000mm wide x 800-1400mrn deep.

In this catchment, the drains in Nguyen Du, Ly Tu Trong streets are being upgraded to mitigate
flood risk in these areas. Wastewater will be collected by GID and transferred by SPS12 in Bach
Dang Street to Hoa Cuong WWTP.
Catchment III: Hai Chau - Le Dinh Duong - Han River
This catchment is bounded to the North by Le Duan Street, to the West by Ong Ich Khiem Street,
to the South by Trung Nu Vuong Street and to the East by the Han River. The size of the
catchment is 169 Ha. The population is approximately 57,000 in 2000 and 67,000 in 2010. Most of
drains in this catchment follow the direction from West to East to the Han River. Among the
outfalls, the recently constructed one in Le Dinh Duong Street is the largest with a size of 3.0m
wide x 1.5m deep.
In this catchment, the drains in Phan Dinh Phung, Hung Vuong, Tran Quoc Toan and Le Dinh
Duong streets are being upgraded to mitigate flood risk in these areas. Wastewater will be
collected by GID and transferred by SPS 13 in Bach Dang Street to Hoa Cuong WWTP.
Catchment IV: Binh Thuan - Nguyen Van Troi - Han River
This catchment is bordered by Hoang Dieu Street to the East, Nguyen Tri Phuong Street to the
West, Nguyen Van Linh Street to the North and Nguyen Van Troi Street to the South. It has an
area of 162 ha. The population is 29,000 in 2000 and 35,000 in 2010.
The main trunk drain is Me Linh drain running in a southerly direction starting from the southern
end of old Thac Gian lake, through the middle of the catchment to Nguyen Van Troi Street and
discharging to the Han River. The Thac Gian lakes have progressively been filled over the years to
cater for residential developments; as a result flooding has become a serious problem in this area.
In phase 1, the Danang sanitation subproject is upgrading only the existing downstream drain in
Nguyen Van Troi Street discharging to Han River. In the additional works programme also the
upstream section is to be upgraded.
Catchment V. Thac Gian - Vinh Trung - Danang Bay
This catchment is bordered by Ong Ich Khiem Street to the east, Danang Bay to the north, Phan
Thanh-Le Do Street to the west, and Nguyen Van Linh Street to the south. It has an area of
174 Ha. The population is 68,000 in 2000 and 80,000 in 2010. This catchment has two main trunk
drains: Bac Dau drain and Thac Gian lake-Tan Chinh lake-Danang Bay drain.
The starting point of the Bac Dau drain is Danang railway station at the end of Hoang Hoa Tham
street. The section crossing the railway station comprises two DN1000 drains to Tran Cao Van
Street, continuing with a drain of 2.Om wide and 1.0 - 1.4m deep. De-sludging this section along
the railway station proves to be very difficult and construction in recent years has left much of
these two drains damaged causing their drainage capacity to be reduced.
Thac Gian - Tan Chinh Lake - Danang Bay drain: This drain starts from the outlet drain in the
north of Thac Gian Lake then goes across Tan Chinh Lake and ends at Danang Bay. Size of the
drain is 2.4 - 3.2m wide and 1.4m deep. The section from Thac Gian Lake to Tan Chinh Lake is
covered by reinforced concrete slabs. The remaining section across Tam Thuan ward is open.
Thac Gian Lake used to be quite large but in recent years the lake is being gradually filled up for
the development of residential area's; the remaining lake area is presently about 3.8ha, the
remaining lake volume is small, about 80,000m3.
Tan Chinh Lake has progressively been encroached on by surrounding households; the remaining
lake area is about 0.5ha. This lake has not been under the management of any agency. It has
become desolate and is currently overgrown with water hyacinth. Depth is approximately only 1m.
According to City planning, this lake will be filled for construction of the Tan Chinh market.

Wastewater in the catchment will be collected by GID along Lien Chieu-Thuan Phuoc road and
transferred by SPS 19, SPS20 and SPS21 to Phu Loc WWTP.
Catchment VI. Airport - 29/3 Lake - Phu Loc River
This catchment stretches from Nguyen Van Linh Street across Danang Airport to National
Highway 1A in the south. It is bordered by Phan Thanh-Le Do Street to the east, Danang Bay to
the north and National Highway IA to the west. It has an area of 905 Ha (including 400 ha of the
airport. The population is 91,000 in 2000 and 112,000 in 2010.
The trunk drainage system consists of
(i)   Drain from 29/3 Lake to Phu Loc River: a 3.8km long drain starting at Lake 29/3 with a
2.4m wide x 2m deep culvert and a 5.4m wide x 2.Om deep drain from the Airport to
Dien Bien Phu Street, continuing with a 3.2-3.5m wide x 1.7m deep drain from Dien
Bien Phu street to Ha Huy Tap street and a 4.2 wide x 1.7m deep drain from Ha Huy
Tap street to Tran Cao Van street. The middle section - being smaller than the up-
stream drain - has insufficient capacity and causes serious flooding in the low lying
area to the south of Dien Bien Phu Street. This is addressed in the additional works
program.
(ii)  Drain from Xuan Hoa A pond to Phu Loc River: This drain presently discharges by
gravity along irrigation canals. The 3.Om wide x 1.8 - 2.Om deep up-stream section with
length of 400m from Xuan Ha A pond to Dien Bien Phu Street and the 4.2m wide x
1.7m deep down-stream section in Thanh Loc Dan residential area are box culverts
with reinforced concrete covers. The earth channel in the middle section between Dien
Bien Phu Street and Tran Cao Van Street overflows on open land because the channel
size is small and culvert crossing the railway has a diameter of only 1.5m. This is
addressed in the additional works program.                               r,
(iii)  Drain from An Khe pond to Phu Loc river: This drain discharges wastewater from two
outfalls in the north-west of Danang Airport. The drain from Huynh Ngoc Hue
residential area (east of Huynh Ngoc Hue Street) to the pond with size of 3.2m wide x
1.2m deep is being constructed. There is an unused earth channel across low land.
Along this channel, there are two large drains: one across Dien Bien Phu Street and a
drain across the railway with a size of 6.Om wide x 2.5m deep.
In this catchment, there are a number of lakes and ponds used for stormwater regulation, such as
29/3 lake, Airport lake, An Khe pond.
29/3 lake: Apart from the function of stormwater drainage, this lake also serves as a recreation
park. Therefore, the water level must be kept at a certain level (+3.00m). The present area of the
lake is 10.3 ha. It is 2.Om deep and has a volume of 200,000m3.
Airport lake: This lake is inside the Danang Airport area. The surface area is about 6.8ha with a
volume of 150,000m3.
An Khe pond: This lake receives a large amount of stormwater run-off Its purpose is merely for
stormwater regulation. The city is planning to build the An Khe cultural park in a part of An Khe
pond in next years. About 12 hectare of the pond will be retained.
Catchment VII: Hoa Cuong - Han River
The Hoa Cuong catchment extends from Nguyen Van Troi Street to the North, Danang airport to
the West, and the Han River to the South and East. This catchment receives a large volume of
wastewater from Danang airport. The area of the catchment is 522 Ha. The population is 29,000 in
2000 and 47,000 in 2010.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                      Detailed Design Report
The catchment is currently drained by two irrigation canals, which discharge into two main
watercourses running parallel in the middle of the catchment (running north to south) and
discharge to the Han River at Do Xu Bridge. During heavy rain, the above irrigation canals can not
meet the required drainage capacity causing flooding in the whole area. In recent years, the south-
west area of the city is being urbanized rapidly.
Catchment VIII: Airport West - Han River
This catchment comprises 1/4 of Airport West. Irrigation canals on the fields of the Hoa Cam
commune drain to Cau Do River in the south.
Catchment IX. West Son Tra district - Han River
This catchment comprises the westem half of Son Tra district. The catchment is bordered by the
dividing line along the old railway to the east, Nguyen Van Thoai Street to the south, Son Tra
peninsula to the north and Han River to the west. Catchment area is 767ha. The population is
57,000 in 2000 and 69,000 in 2010. Flow direction in this catchment is western, along roads.
Catchment X. East Son Tra district - China Beach
This catchment comprises the eastern half of Son Tra district. The catchment is bordered by the
dividing line along the old railway to the west, Nguyen Van Thoai Street to the south, Son Tra
peninsula to the north and the East Sea to the east. The catchment area is 813ha. The population is
44,000 in 2000 and 54,000 in 2010.
Flow direction in this catchment is easterly, along the watercourses at the My Khe Beach Hotel,
An Don export processing zone and roads.
Catchment XI. East Ngu Hanh Son district - China Beach
This catchment comprises of the eastern half of Ngu Hanh Son district. The catchment is bordered
by Ngu Hanh Son Street to the west, Nguyen Van Thoai Street to the north, Non Nuoc resort to the
south and the East Sea to the east. The catchment area is 541ha. The population is 21,000 in 2000
and 32,000 in 2010. Drainage system in this catchment is not completed. Drainage is generally by
means of soakage and infiltration into the soil, or as overland flows to nearby watercourses and
subsequently to the East Sea.
Catchment XII: West Ngu Hanh Son district - Han river
This catchment comprises of the western half of Ngu Hanh Son district. The catchment is bordered
by Ngu Hanh Son Street to the east, Nguyen Van Thoai Street to the north, Hoa Hai ward to the
south and Han River to the west. The catchment area is 440ha. The population is 16,000 in 2000
and 22,000 in 2010. No drainage system currently exists in this catchment because population is
small and is concentrated along Ngu Hanh Son Street. Presently the area between the Tran Thi Ly
Bridge and the Tuyen Son Bridge is being back filled and will be developed into a residential area
similarly to the areas to the north.
Catchment XIII: Lien Chieu South - Danang Bay
The Phu Loc River drains this catchment and discharges to the Danang Bay. Catchment area is
1,170ha.
Catchment XIV: Lien Chieu Center - Danang Bay
This catchment drains to the Cu De River and Dai'ang Bay. The catchment has an area of about
825 ha.

Catchment XV: Lien Chieu North - Danang Bay
This catchment drains to the Cu De River and Danang Bay. The catchment has an area of about
460 ha.
2.1.2 Scope of Drainage Works
The feasibility study identified a number of drains which were removed from the ongoing Phase I
project because of budget concerns. Among the removed works were drains for areas regularly
suffering from serious flooding. On account of the additional available budget these works can
now be implemented after all. In addition, priority areas for drainage improvement were identified.
For the resulting list of drains detailed designs have been prepared (see Figure 2-1):
1.    Drain from Le Dinh Tham to Duy Tan Road.
This drain will be referred to as the Le Dinh Tham Drain
2.    Drain from Dien Bien Phu Street to Danang Bay through Le Do Street.
This drain will be referred to as the Le Do Drain
3.    Drain from Dien Bien Phu Street (Xuan Hoa pond) to Tran Cao Van Street (Phu Loc
River).
This drain will be referred to as the Xuan Hoa Drain
4.    Drain from An Khe pond to Phu Loc River.
This drain will be referred to as the An Khe Drain
5.    Drain from My Khe to Bac Me An.
This drain will be referred to as the My Khe Drain
Where the ongoing Phase 1 works mainly address the drainage in the catchments I, II, III & V, the
above drains will particularly improve the drainage capacity of catchmnent IV (Drain #1) and
catchment VI (Drains #2, #3 & #4).
The ongoing Phase 1 project also includes a number of drains in catchments X & Xl. These drains,
however, do not have a proper outlet out of the area. Drain #5, the My Khe Drain, will integrate
with those drains and provide the necessary primary infrastructure to discharge stormwater run-off
to the sea.

2.2 Design criteria
During the engineering study for the ongoing Phase I project, GHD-Kinhill developed a number of
design criteria. Based on these design criteria, detailed designs for the stormwater drains were
made. The Ministry of Construction and the World Bank approved the designed system.
As it is not desirable to alter the design criteria at this stage, especially where they were approved
by all, and since the additional works program is a supplement to the ongoing Phase I works, also
here in principle the same design criteria have been applied.
2.2.1 Meteorology
The climate of Danang city is sunny and hot during the dry season (from February to August) and
rainy and wet during the rainy season (from September to January). The annual average
temperature is 25.60 C and the annual average precipitation is 2,066 mm. Danang city is much
affected by major storms from the middle of September to January.
Data of rainfall in Danang city starting from the year 1963 is still archived in the hydro-
meteorological centre of the Middle Province of Vietnam. About 70% of annual rainfall falls
during the rainy season of which October and November are the wettest months, with about
1,000mm of precipitation (equivalent to 50% of annual average rainfall). February, March and
April are the driest months, with about 30-100mm of precipitation (see Table 2-1).

Table 2-1 Rainfall in months of year (mm)
Total annual evaporation in Danang city is about 1,120mm. The highest evaporation is from May
to August and lowest in December.
The Danang drainage system directly discharges to Han River, Danang Bay and the East Sea; it is
therefore directly affected by tide. Tidal patterns are mainly semi-diurnal in nature. High tide and
low tide last for 5.5 hours on average. However, sometimes the tide pattern is diurnal; as a result
high tide and low tide last longer. In that case the duration of low tide and high tide is on average

All outfall drains, which have been provided with dry weather flow interceptors as part of the
wastewater collection system, have been provided with a weir with an overflow level of +0.6m to
minimise high tide swamping of that system.
2.2.2 Return periods
As with other natural phenomena, occurrence of flooding is governed by chance. The chance of
flooding is described by a statistical analysis of flooding history in the subject watershed or in
similar watersheds. Because it is not economically feasible to design a structure for the maximum
possible runoff from a watershed, the designer must choose a design frequency appropriate for the
structure.
The expected frequency for a given flood is the reciprocal of the probability or chance that the
flood will be equalled or exceeded in a given year. For example, if a flood has a 20 percent chance
of being equalled or exceeded each year, over a long period of time the flood will be equalled or
exceeded on an average of once every five years. This is called the return period or recurrence
interval (RI).
A five-year flood is not one that will necessarily be equalled or exceeded every five years. There is
a 20 percent chance that the flood will be equalled or exceeded in any year; therefore, the five-year
flood could conceivably occur in several consecutive years. The same reasoning applies to floods
with other return periods.
In determining the required dimensions of a drain a distinction is made between smaller collector
drains with a total catchment size of no more than 30ha., medium size trunk drains with a total
catchment size of between 30ha. and 100ha., and large size end drains with a total catchment size
of more than lOOha. (see Table 2-3).
Drainage Area  Return Period
Smaller collector drains    < 30 ha.       2 years
Medium size trunk drains  30 - 100 ha.     5 years
Large size end drains      > 100 ha.       10 years
Table 2-3 Design return periods
2.2.3 Flow estimation
The flow estimations on which the drains were designed have been carried out using the Rational
Method.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                        Detailed Design Report
The Rational fornula estimates the peak rate of runoff at any location in a watershed as a function
of the drainage area, runoff coefficient, and mean rainfall intensity for a duration equal to the time
of concentration (the time required for water to flow from the most remote point of the basin to the
location being analyzed).
The rational formula is expressed as
Q=C x I x A
where:
Q = maximum rate of runoff (m3/s)
C = runoff coefficient
I= average rainfall intensity (Us.ha)
A = drainage area (ha)
Calculation of the flow at the various inlets and junctions along the drain line is carried out from
the top of the system progressively downstream.
The runoff coefficient indicates the fraction of stormnwater originating from the catchment that
actually reaches the drain. Generally, larger areas with permeable soils, flat slopes and dense
vegetation should have the lowest "C" values. Smaller areas with dense or impermeable soils,
moderate to steep slopes, and sparse vegetation should be assigned the highest "C" values.
A run-off coefficient of between 0.5 and 0.8 has been adopted for all residential areas depending
on the extent of development. For some areas, even though at present they are not extensively
developed, a high "C" value of 0.8 is assigned because of the planned development of the area.
Because the drainage works will need to meet the drainage requirements of Danang for a design
horizon of approximately 20 years, relatively high values for "C" have been adopted.
The total peak flow at any point is dependent on the Timc of Concentration (ta) at that point, the
actual flow being the result of the sum of the CXA values of the contributing sub-catchments,
multiplied by I appropriate for t, at that point.
The time of concentration is the time at which the entire watershed begins to contribute to runoff,
this is calculated as the time taken for runoff to flow from the most hydraulically remote point of
the drainage area to the point under investigation. Use of the rational formula requires the time of
concentration for each design point within the drainage basin.
The duration of rainfall is then set equal to the time of concentration and is used to estimate the
design average rainfall intensity (I).
The time of concentration is calculated as the sum of the catchment's overland flow time and
channel flow times. Pipe flow times are calculated as the time of travel through the pipe at its
average flow velocity when flowing full multiplied by a factor of 2 for flat gradients of less than
1%.
The average rainfall intensity (I) has been determined according to the formula of Dr. Tran Huu
Uyen':
I = [(20 + b)y 120 (1 + C LogP)]/(l + t)n
where:
I = average rainfall intensity (U/s.ha)
n, b, C depend on the geographical area

2.2.4 Shape and gradients of drains
The Manning Equation for Uniform Flow has been used as the basis for determining the size and
grades of the drains:
Q = I/n x A R% SV
where:
Q = discharge (m3/s)
n = Manning's roughness coefficient (a coefficient for quantifying the roughness characteristics of
the channel)
A = cross-sectional area of flow (m2)
R = hydraulic radius (m) = A / WP
WP = wetted perimeter of flow (the length of the channel boundary in direct contact with the
water) (m)
S = slope of the energy grade line (m/m) (For uniform, steady flow, S = channel slope)
Drains are laid with uniform slope between manholes. The minimum slope applied is 0.1%.
Hydrauiic energy profiles have been accepted as closely following the tops of the channels.
Drains are laid with straight alignment between manholes except where street or road layouts are
such that straight alignment between manholes is impractical, drains may be curved to conform to
their curvature.
When a smaller drain joins a larger one, the invert of the larger sewer is lowered sufficiently to
maintain the same energy gradient. An appropriate method for securing this result is to place the
soffit of both drains at the same level. Generally, drains do not decrease in size in downstream
direction unless the gradient of the downstream section is much larger than upstream.
The forrn of the drainage conduits depends on a variety of factors, including:
*  Construction cost
* Flow capacity required
*  Width of land available for drainage works
*  Degree of disruption which might be caused by construction of the drain
Traditionally, drainage in Danang has been constructed using box channel sections as compared to
pipe sections. The use of box channel sections is attractive especially for larger size drains because
they can be constructed using local labour at lower unit costs than equivalent flow capacity pipe
sections. Box channel sections have therefore been adopted as the standard section for new and
upgrade channel type drainage works for the ongoing Phase I works. The designs for the
stormwater drains of the additional works program also use the box channel as standard section.

Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project                         Additional Works Program
Danang Sub-project (Phase I)                                       Detailed Design Report
Since all the drains in the additional works programme are in the middle or at the end or
catchments there is no need to set a minimum size for box channel sections.
A major issue for drainage design in the Danang area, because of its predominately flat gradients,
is the consideration of the required self scouring of the drainage channels.
Lack of self scouring ability increases maintenance requirements for drain desludging and reduces
public and occupational health and safety.
Box channel sections traditionally have flat bottoms that are not effective in their self scouring
ability, especially with the inevitable flat gradients. As a result they suffer from siltation and debris
accumulation. A method to increase self scouring ability, box channel drains can be constructed
with a low flow circular shaped invert with battered benches. The size of the circular invert is
adequate to carry the peak dry weather flow.
However, application of battered benches increases the amount of concrete needed to construct the
drain - and thus the cost - considerably. Especially for drains with a width of more than 1.5meter,
the amount of extra concrete necessary to construct the battered benches is substantial; although it
must be said that the concrete used for the battered benches is of a low grade.
For example, a circular shaped invert with battered benches will add around 20% of concrete
volume to a drain of 2m by 2m. A low flow circular shaped invert with battered benches is
appropriate for small drains of say less than 1.5m wide.
For larger drains, however, to concentrate the flow in the centre of the drain and thus increase the
self scouring ability without adding to the volurthe of concrete, the bottoms of the drains are
constructed in a V-shape. Although this is slightly less effective than the circular shaped invert
with battered benclves it is a less costly compromise that will still reduce maintenance requirenients
for drain desludging and improve public and occupational health and safety.
In cases where two or more channel sections are needed because of the required large flow width,
only one channel shall have a V-shaped invert. The invert of the other channel(s) shall slope
towards the V-shaped invert with a minimum slope of 2%.
The dividing wall between the channels shall have connection pipes (diameter 150mm) every 25m
allowing the small flow to cross over into the section with the V-shaped invert.
Typical cross-sections are shown in Figure 2-2, Figure 2-3 and Figure 2-4.

Due to the characteristics of storm events (relatively short and heavy, only during a certain time of
year), box channel section that carry stormwater only shall not have the V-shaped invert.
2.2.5 Wastewater and drains, interception of wastewater
In general drains in Danang carry both wastewater and stormwater; i.e. the drainage system is a
combined system.
Wastewater from residences, hotels, restaurants, factories, etc. flows either overland to the nearest
drain inlet or through a connection pipe between the premises and the drain directly into the drain.
Stormwater flows overland to the nearest inlet - usually a kerb inlet along the road.
The design of the drainage network of Danang is such that water (be it wastewater or stormwater)
is transported from the drain inlet to the nearest body of open water where it is discharged.
Under the ongoing Phase I project, a wastewater collection system is being constructed in each of
four wastewater catchments in Danang (also see paragraph 4.1.2). Each wastewater catchment will
thus be provided with a wastewater collection system, generally located near outfalls where dry
weather flows of wastewater will be intercepted and diverted from the combined drains.
Except for the Le Do Drain (2) all drains in the additional works program carry both stormwater
and wastewater. Even though the Le Do drain only carries stormwater run-off, a facility for
diversion of wastewater has been included in the design of the outfall. In case it turns out that a
considerable amount of wastewater enters the drain after all, diversion of wastewater can be easily
achieved. This is also the case should it be decided that the Le Do drain is to carry both stormwater
and wastewater flows.
The two drains Le Dinh Tham and Xuan Hoa form an intermediate section. Their outfalls do not
form part of the additional works program. The downstream section of Le Dinh Tham drain has
already been upgraded under the ongoing Phase 1 project; its outfall has been fitted with a
wastewater interceptor. The downstream section of Xuan Hoa drain is not part of any ongoing or
planned upgrading; however, interception of wastewater at its outfall was planned under the Phase
1 project. Due to a change of alignment of a rising main, interception of wastewater at this point
has been removed from the scope of that project.
The An Khe drain forms the outlet for a number of retention ponds; wastewater should not be
allowed to enter these ponds in the first place. Wastewater generated upstream from the ponds
should be intercepted and diverted to a treatment plant before it enters the ponds. The choice of
diverting wastewater upstream from the An Khe drain or at its outfall can be made at a later stage.
Although no wastewater will be intercepted under the additional works program, a facility for
diversion of wastewater has been included in the design of the outfall.
At the outfalls of the My Khe drain wastewater will actually be intercepted. To that end design of
each of its outfalls has been fitted with a diversion structure and a pumping station.
2.2.6 Side Entry Pits (kerb inlets)
The ability of a drainage system to capture and carry away stormwater is limited by the
effectiveness of its inlet structures.
The standard Vietnamese practice in Danang of placing grates, or trash collection bars, across inlet
openings is very restrictive on the inlet's capacity because of the marked reduction in inlet area as

a result of the collection of trash behind the grate bars. Even though Danang's streets are regularly
swept, the situation is often reached in heavy downpours where inlets are partially or even totally
blocked by the collection of trash, leaves and fallen tree branches behind grate bars.
To address to above mentioned limitations a new side entry pit design was made by GHD-Kinhill.
This side entry pit has no grate bars and a much larger opening. The design, however, met with
objections from URENCO and the general public due to the large and unprotected opening. A
revised design with a number of modifications was made by CMC in conjunction with URENCO,
as shown in Figure 2-5.

Figure 2-5 Typical section of a Side Entry Pit
The spacing of the side entry pits is related to the capacity of the roadway to carry flow without
excessive inconvenience by flooding to road users. In places with known local flooding problems
and/or major overland flow from side streets, an inlet spacing of approximately 25m is set to
achieve sufficient road-flow capture. In other places an inlet spacing of approximately 50m is
sufficient.
2.2.7 Inlets for maintenance (manholes)
In order to be able to carry out maintenance on the drain, inlets are provided at regular intervals for
a person and/or equipment to enter the drain. These manholes are installed at the end of each line;
at all changes in grade, size, or alignment; at all intersections; and at distances not greater than 50
meters.
The minimum size of the manhole is 1.2m x 0.75m (rectangular), or 1.2m (circular diameter).
The minimum opening dimensions of manhole covers are 600mm x 600mm (rectangular), or
600mm (circular diameter).
In those cases where the drain consists of two (or more) channels, the manholes are consecutively
located on alternate channels. Access between channels is provided by openings in the dividing
wall.

2.2.8 Siltation and trash collection
As mentioned in paragraph 2.2.4, the design of the cross-section of the drain is meant to reduce
maintenance requirements for drain desludging. However, due to the predominately flat gradients
in Danang, siltation of the drains can never be fully avoided and can become a major problem.
Also the sandy nature of the area's soils, stormwater litter, wastewater sludge, lack of erosion and
sediment control measures at constructions sites and rubbish disposal into drains by residents
contribute to the problem.
Therefore, even with the measures in place to improve the self scouring ability drains need to be
inspected regularly for blockages and siltation.
To reduce the inflow of silt and sand, silt traps are provided on all side entry pits. These need to be
desilted (either manually or by suction truck) on a regular basis.
During heavy storm events trash can be dragged along and enter the drain through side entry pits.
Also at overflows from stormwater regulation lakes trash can enter the drains.
In order to avoid trash from be discharged from the outfalls to the Phu Loc River (An Khe Drain),
Danang Bay (Le Do Drain) or East Sea (My Khe Drain) trash capture devices are installed at the
outfall of each drain.
Raking out the trash and its collection should be done on a regular basis - with a higher frequency
during the rainy season and a lower frequency during the dry season.
Material collected is to be carted to the new solid waste landfill area.

c. Geologicalfeatures of the works
Most of the earth layers along the drainage works are sandy soil but it is not excluded that some
locations where the drains cross were farming fields or river beds in the past, pockets of mud may
be found. If the drainage foundation is of sand, it can bear the loads of the drain and of the traffic
above. However, a 0.2 m-thick layer of stone should be used to be able to drain away groundwater
easily form the trench. If mud is found, the mud area can be either replaced with sand or the
foundation can be strengthened using bamboo piles. Concrete piles are not preferred, as they are
expensive and connection to drains with a shallow foundation is problematic.

Furthermore, a vibration factor must be taken into account that represents the extra forces on the
drain caused by vehicle movement on the drain. A vibration factor of 1.3 is used.
The weight loading on the drain include:
- The load of the reinforced concrete drain itself
-  The load of soil cover over the drain (including road base and soil on top of the drain)
- The water inside the drain
- The loads by people and vehicles during road traffic
- Other loads that interact to the drain foundation (as mentioned above)
3. Structural solution
As the completed structures have to function in aggressive environments (salt water, wastewater),
reinforcement may more easily be affected. To avoid early corrosion of reinforcements, concrete
cover on each reinforcement bar is selected as 50 mm. The concrete design strength used for drain
works is 25 MPa. Reinforced steel used for drainage works is the C-II steel, with design tensile
stress 2600 kg/cm2 (260 N/mm2). Any C-I steel used will be calculated with design tensile stress
of 2100 kg/cm2 (210 N/mm2).

3 DRAINAGE - DETAILED DESIGNS
3.1 Le Dinh Tham drain
3.1.1 Location and justification
The existing drains in Binh Thuan ward, connecting the old Thac Gian Lake to the Han River,
have insufficient capacity to meet the current drainage needs. The area suffers from frequent
flooding.
Originally almost the entire drain from the old Thac Gian Lake to the Han River was to be
upgraded as part of the ongoing Phase 1 Sub-project. Due to budget constraints it was decided that
only the downstream section in Duy Tan Street from Le Dinh Tham T-junction to the Han River
was to be upgraded.
In order to solve the drainage problem in this area as well as make full use of the new drain in Duy
Tan Street, part of the upstream stretch from Thac Gian Lake to Duy Tan Street is added to the
scope of the additional works programme.
The section upstream from Le Dinh Thanh Street (Binh Tuan ward) is characterized by a densely
built-up area and narrow alleys (no more than 2-2.5m wide). Most alleys already have a drain
along it. Options for increasing the drainage capacity of the area are limited. There are two parallel
alleys running north of Le Dinh Thanh Street. The one on the east has a drain 2.4m wide x 1.3m
high. The one on the west has no drain and can be used to increase the drainage capacity.
Upgrading further upstream would require widening of alleys and consequently demolishing a
great number of houses necessitating considerable relocation.
Under the additional works programme a.section of around 350m upstream from Le Dinh Thanh
Street will be added along the alley that has no drain yet. To this section a 260m long drain along
Le Dinh Thanh Street is added until the T-junction with Duy Tan Street.
The new drain will be connected to the - under phase 1 project upgraded - drain in Duy Tan
Street.
3.1.2 Catchment area and design flows
The catchment area of the Le Dinh Thanh drain consists of the western part of Binh Thuan ward
and most of Hoa Thuan ward. The total drainage area is around 123 ha. The upstream section of
the drain along Le Dinh Thanh Street and the upstream alley drains around 77 ha.
The design flow increases from 9.8 m3/s for the section in the alley to 12 m3/s for the section in Le
Dinh Thanh Street.
3.1.3 Alignment and longitudinal profile
As mentioned above the new drain will run for about 350m along an alley north of Le Dinh Thanh
Street and connect to the existing drain at the upstream end. The complete width of the alley will
be required. At the downstream end the drain will connect to the drains (old and new) along Le
Dinh Thanh Street.
Along Le Dinh Thanh Street - from Trung Nu Vuong Street to the T-junction with Duy Tan Street
- a new drain will be laid under the pavement on the western side.
For a Plan and Profile see Drawing DG-A-DT1-01-01.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                      Detailed Design Report
3.1.4 Cross section
The cross section of the drain along the alley in Binh Tuan ward consists of 1 channel of 2.2m
wide and 1.5m high; the drain along Le Dinh Thanh Street is 2.7m wide and 1.5m high (see
Drawing DG-A-DT 1-01-0?).
See Appendix A. 1 for a detailed hydraulic calculation.
Special attention has been paid to the self scouring ability of the drain during low flow. The floor
of the middle channel has been set at angle so that a V-shape is formed. The cross section in this
part is smaller, thus increasing the depth of flow and velocity under low flow conditions.
3.1.5 Connections to other drains
The new drain in the alley will have to connect at the upstream end with the existing drains at an
invert level of 2.30m. On exiting the alley the drain is to be connected with the existing drains
along Trung Nu Vuong Street as well as the existing drain in Le Dinh Thanh Street at invert level
1.95m. The new drain along Le Dinh Thanh Street will also start at this level and connect to the
new drains in Duy Tan Street at invert level 1.69m.
3.1.6 Interception of wastewater flows from the drain
The concerning drain forms the middle part of the Thac Gian Lake - Han River drainage system.
The drain will serve for both wastewater and stormwater flow combined. The wastewater will be
intercepted 940m downstream of the new drain near the outfall at Nguyen Van Troi Street. From
there the wastewater will flow through GID14 to SPS14 and ultimately to Hoa Cuong WWTP.
3.1.7 Special issues
The upper reaches of the drainage system of Binh Thuan ward will still not have enough capacity
after the above mentioned additions. Tackling that problem at this point in time does not seem
feasible, but it should be addressed in due course.
The upstream end of the new alley drain is the lowest point in the area. Any stormwater that can
not be conveyed through the upstream drainage system will flow overland to this point. It is
therefore essential to make a proper facility for any overland stormwater flow to easily enter the
drain at this point; this will reduce any inconvenience due to the limited upstream drainage
capacity considerably. A long entry structure is therefore included in the design at this point.
3.2 Le Do drain
3.2.1 Location, options and justification
Thanh Khe district is developing rapidly. Recent surveys and capacity calculations have revealed
that the district's drainage system needs to be upgraded to be more suitable with the development
of the District.
At the moment, the run-off from the Airport and 29/3 Lake catchment areas flows along a
watercourse/drain north of Dien Bien Phu Street (on the border between An Khe and Xuan Ha
wards) through a low lying area towards the Phu Loc River. This low lying area is prone to
frequent flooding. Now that these low lying areas are being developed into residential areas the
stormwater coming from the Airport and 29/3 Lake catchment areas needs to be diverted.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                     Detailed Design Report
The following options (of which number 2 and 3 are discussed in the Feasibility study) have been
considered:
Option 1: Upgrade the drain along the existing route
The first option is to increase the capacity of the existing watercourse/drain.
Advantages:
The middle stretch of the route runs through an open area requiring no cutting of roads or
relocation of affected persons.
Limitations:
Due to the distance between Dien Bien Phu Street and the Phu Loc River (>3km) the length of
drain needing to be upgraded is considerable. The limited available hydraulic slope would require
the width of the drain to be substantially more than that of the existing drains/watercourse. As a
result of the density of the built-up area along particularly the up- and down-stream ends of this
route, this option would require a significant amount of relocation.
Option 2: Partially upgrade the existing drain and construct a new drain through Chinh Gian
and Tam Thuan residential areas to Danang Bay
The second option goes through Chinh Gian residential area, a concrete enterprise, Lane 256 Tran
Cao Van and Tam Thuan residential area. This is a drain of around 950m long connecting Dien
Bien Phu Street with Danang Bay.
Advantages:
The length of drain is relatively short and traffic will not be obstructed much during construction.
Also, the access road to the houses along the drain will be improved.
Limitations:
The available area for construction is very limited; the route runs along narrow alleys. Due to the
limited space heavy machinery cannot be used resulting in an increased time'of construction and
an increased cost of construction. Also the number of people affected by the construction and the
people to be relocated is substantial.
Excavation and construction depth is large due to low invert level of the existing drain in Xuan Ha
ward; the resulting low invert level at the outfall reduces the capacity of the drain because of tidal
influence. Operation and maintenance costs are also expected to be high.
Option 3: Construct a completely new drain along Le Do Street to Danang Bay
The third option has a drain running along Le Do Street. This is a drain of around I 100m long
connecting Dien Bien Phu Street with Danang Bay.
Advantages:
The benefits lie in the less costly construction because of the accessibility for heavy equipment and
resulting shorter construction period; also the depth of construction is less than for the other
options. Required resettlement is very limited because the upstream 800m can be constructed in
the existing Le Do Street. Only the remaining 250m downstream section crossing an existing
neighbourhood needs resettlement. Also operation and maintenance costs are expected to be lower.
Limitations:
Construction along the Le Do Street will cause inconvenience for local residents and obstruct
traffic, albeit temporary. The length of drain is slightly longer than option 2, but considerably
shorter than option 1.
Recommendation:
Based on the above advantages and limitations option 3 to construct a drain along Le Do Street is
chosen.

The Le Do Drain has been included in the ongoing Phase I works (contract 013). Because of the
impending construction of the road linking Tran Cao Van Street and Nguyen Tat Thanh Street it is
necessary to construct the drain - which lies along this new section of road - as soon as possible. If
the drain is not constructed soonest, either the construction of the road has to be delayed or the
road will need to be cut only a short time after it has been constructed.
3.2.2 Catchment area and design flows
As mentioned.above, the main function with the drain is to divert stormwater from the Airport and
29/3 catchment areas away from the low lying area between An Khe and Xuan Ha wards and
towards Danang Bay.
The catchment area of 29/3 Lake is around 63 ha. The catchment area of the Airport Lake is
around 205 ha. Both lakes have a stormwater regulation function and reduce the peak flow
considerably. The area drained by 29/3 Lake is densely populated and built up; a run-off
coefficient of 0.8 has been adopted for this area. The area drained by the Airport Lake is mainly
unpaved; a run-off coefficient of 0.5 has been adopted for this area.
The following tables (Table 3-1 and Table 3-2) show the hydraulic behaviour of the lakes.
The level of both lakes is normally kept at 3.00m. As stormwater run-off starts flowing into the
lakes the level is raised; with the rising level, water starts to flow out off the lake. The higher the
level of the lake, the larger the outflow from the lake. As long as the inflow to the lake is larger
than the outflow, the level is being raised.
For a 10 year return period the inflow to the lakes has been determined. Also for each 0.1 Om of
raised lake level the outflow has been determined.
The level of 29/3 Lake is raised to a maximum of 3.55m before the outflow becomes larger than
the inflow; the maximum stormwater outflow at that moment is 2.89 m3/s

Similarly, the level of the Airport Lake is raised to a maximum of 3.49m before the outflow
becomes larger than the inflow; the maximum stormwater outflow at that moment is 10.35 m3/s.

See Appendix A.2 for a detailed flood routing calculation.
Along Le Do Street a number of existing drains will be connected to the new drain. The
contributing area is around 44 ha.
The flow towards Xuan Ha ward needs to be limited in order to reduce the flood risk in that area.
At the upstream entry to the existing drain (Dien Bien Phu Street) a slot of 5m wide x 0.3m high
will allow the dry weather flow as well as a limited stormwater flow (max 3.5 m3/s) to continue
through the existing drain.
The new drain through Le Do Street will be used strictly for excess stormwater discharge. All
upstream dry weather flow (wastewater) will continue to flow through the existing drain.
The design flow for the drain in Le Do Street at the upstream entry point is 2.89+10.35-
3.5=9.74 m3/s gradually increasing to 13.97 m3/s at the downstream end.
3.2.3 Alignment and longitudinal profile
The drain will start at the crossing of the existing drain (5.4m wide x 2.Om deep) in Dien Bien Phu
Street near the bus station. The starting invert level is 1.80m. The drain will run eastward in Dien
Bien Phu Street along the northern side of the road. At the corner of Dien Bien Phu Street and Le
Do Street the drain will turn northward into Le Do Street. From here until Danang Bay the drain
will continue along the western side of Le Do Street. A connecting road is being built from the
T-junction of Le Do Street with Tran Cao Van Street to the road along Danang Bay. Saving can be
achieved by first putting in the drain and then surface the road.
The drain will lie in the road along the entire route since the sidewalks are occupied by existing
roadside drains. For a Plan and Profile see Drawing DG-A-LD2-0 1-01.
3.2.4 Cross section
The cross section of the drain is 2 x 2m wide and 1.5m high for the first 489m and 2 x 2m wide
and 1. 7m high for the remaining 55 5m (see Drawing DG-A-LD2-01-0?).
See Appendix A.2 for a detailed hydraulic calculation.

3.2.5 Connections to other drains
At five locations the new drain will cross an existing drain. Drainage capacity of the area is
improved by making a connection between the existing drains and the new drain so that excess
stormwater can overflow into the new drain.
Special attention needs to be given to preventing wastewater from entering the new drain from the
connection to existing (combined) drains.
To that end the invert of the new drain at the up-stream connection will be 300mm higher (1.80m)
than the invert level of the existing drain (1.50m) crossing Dien Bien Phu Street. The wastewater
will continue flowing along the existing drain, towards Phu Loc River.
In addition, every connection to other drains along Le Do Street has a small weir.
3.2.6 Interception of wastewater flows from the drain
Dry weather flow from upstream as well as along the route of the new drain will not be allowed to
enter. At present, wastewater either flows through the existing drain on the border between An Khe
and Xuan Ha wards (from the area of 29/3 Lake and the Airport Lake) towards Phu Loc River; or
through existing drains in the Xuan Ha, Tam Huan and Chinh Gian wards towards Danang Bay
where it is intercepted by the newly built GlDs along the boulevard. No additional wastewater
discharge capacity is required. By not allowing wastewater to enter the drain no interceptor
structure will be required at the outfall to the Danang Bay. This will reduce cost (construction and
O&M).
3.2.7 Special issues
As mentioned in paragraph 3.2.2, the flow towards Xuan Ha ward through the existing drain needs
to be limited in order to reduce the flood risk in that area. At the upstream entry to the existing
drain (Dien Bien Phu Street) a slot of 5m wide x 0.3m high will allow the dry weather flow as well
as a limited stormwater flow (max 3.5 m3/s) to continue through the existing drain.
This can be achieved by installing runners on each side of the drain into which partitions can be
slotted. A stopper of 300mm high at the bottom of the runners prevents the bottom partition to
slide all the way down leaving a slot for the dry weather flow as well as a limited stormwater flow
to continue through the existing drain. Each partition is around 300mm high; six partitions would
be necessary to close the top section of the existing drain. A gap of at least 300mm needs to be left
open at the top to be able to slide the partitions into the runners.
Because of the high build-up of sand along this section of Danang Bay,
3.3 Xuan Hoa drain
3.3.1 Location, options and justification
The catchment of this drain includes northwest of Danang Airport and the northern part of An Khe
ward. At the northwestern side of the airport a stormwater management lake is situated: Xuan Hoa
pond. Formerly this pond was relatively small; however, as part of the redevelopment of the area a
much larger body of water has been created (according to the most recent master plan
approximately 4.7 ha.). A number of (new) drains from the area discharge into this lake. At the
northwest corner of the lake there is an outlet to a new drain (3.0m wide, 1.5m high); this drain
connects northwards, to Dien Bien Phu Street.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                     Detailed Design Report
North of Dien Bien Phu Street the drain continues as an open earth channel, at places very narrow
and shallow. During rainfall the open channel overflows into the surrounding low lying area
causing flooding. According to the city's plans, the low lying area is to be backfilled up to a level
of 3m and further developed as a residential area. To protect this redeveloped area against flood
risks the flow needs to be contained. The following options have been considered:
Option 1: Upgrade the drain along the e-xisting route
The first option is to increase the capacity of the existing watercourse/drain. This would mean that
the open earth channel is to be upgraded to a box channel section with sufficient capacity to
discharge the incoming upstream flow as well as the local drainage.
Advantages:
Almost the entire length of the drain runs through an open area requiring very limited cutting of
roads or relocation of affected persons. Access to the area for heavy equipment is good except for
the first two hundred meters. The area the drain runs through will be developed into a residential
area and can take advantage of the drainage capacity of the drain.
Limitations:
The length of drain is longer than the second option by around 300m. Although the slope along the
first 70 meters is considerable, along most of the route the available (hydraulic) slope is limited.
Option 2: Drain along Ha Huy Tap Street
An alternative route considered is similar to the one for the drainage of San Bay and 29/3 Lakes to
the east (Le Do drain, see paragraph 3.2). From the crossing with Dien Bien Phu Street the drain
runs eastward in Dien Bien Phu Street. At the corner of Dien Bien Phu Street and Ha Huy Tap
Street the drain turns northward. From there until Danang Bay the drain continues along Ha Huy
Tap Street.
Advantages:
This route is shorter (around 900m instead of around 1200m) than the existing route. Required
resettlement is very limited because the downstream section crossing an existing neighbourhood is
combined with the construction of a new road between Tran Cao Van Street and Danang Bay for
which resettlement is already required. The rest of the route is along existing roads.
Limitations:
The route is almost entirely along existing roads increasing the cost because of road reconstruction.
Construction along Ha Huy Tap Street will cause inconvenience for local residents and obstruct
traffic. This route will require crossing an existing drain going east to west just south of the
railway (connecting the low lying area between Xuan Ha and An Khe wards with the Phu Loc
River). This drain has a very low invert level and special arrangements would have to be made in
order to prevent the inflow of seawater during high tide.
Also, this route does not address the drainage of the area itself between Dien Bien Phu Street and
Tran Cao Van Street west of Ha Huy Tap Street.
Recommendation:
Based on the above advantages and limitations option I to construct a drain along the existing
route is chosen.
3.3.2 Catchment area and design flows
The catchmnent area of Xuan Hoa pond is around 100 ha. and covers the northwestern side of the
airport and the middle of An Khe ward. Since the area is being gradually redeveloped and

The level the lake is normally kept at 2.00m.; this is the invert level of the outgoing -drain.
As stormwater run-off starts flowing into the lake the level rises; with the rising level, water starts
to flow out off the lake. The higher the level of the lake, the larger the outflow from the lake. As
long as the inflow to the lake is larger than the outflow, the level continues to rise.
For a 10 year return period the inflow to the lakes has been determined. Also for each 0.1 Om of
raised -lake level the outflow has been determined.
The level of Xuan Hoa pond rises to a maximum of 2.81m before the outflow becomes larger than
the inflow; the maximum stormwater outflow at that moment is 7.79 m3/s.
See Appendix A.3 for a detailed flood routing calculation.
The design flow for the drain at the upstream entry point (Dien Bien Phu Street) is 8.07 m3/s
(being the design stormwater run-off increased with 0.28 m3/s wastewater flow from the upstream
area) gradually increasing to 10.04 m3/s at the downstream end (Tran Cao Van Street).
3.3.3 Alignment and longitudinal profile
The drain will start by crossing Dien Bien Phu Street 150m west of Ha Huy Tap Street, connecting
to the existing (new) drain (3.Om wide x 1.5m high). The starting invert level is 1.80m. The drain
will run northward with a steep gradient (1.5%) between a number of houses up to a small pathway
crossing. In some places this section is quite narrow. After crossing the pathway, the gradient
becomes quite flat (0.1%) necessitating a wide drain (4.2m wide).
Following the railway crossing, the drain turns westward and runs (with a gradient of 0.1%) along
the fence of the Hospital. This and the more westward lying area will be backfilled up to a level of
3m and developed as a residential area. The drain will follow planned road alignments. For the last

IOOm again the drain runs between a number of houses and a school up to Tran Cao Van Street.
Here it connects to an existing drain (invert level -0.25m) to Phu Loc River.
Except for about 150m, the drain will lie.in open terrain. At a later stage, a road will be built over
the drain.
Of the 150m not in open terrain, the drain will lie for about lOOm in the sidewalk and for about
50m in an asphalt road.
For a Plan and Profile see Drawing DG-A-XH3-01 -01.
3.3.4 Cross section
The cross section of the drain is I channel of 2m wide and 1.5m high (see Drawing DG-A-XH3-
01-0?) for the first 70m between a narrow part with two rows of houses and I channel of 2.2m
wide and 1.5m high for the next 140m (Dien Bien Phu - railway); for the remaining 895m (railway
- Tran Cao Van Street) the cross section consists of 2 channels of which 160m each 2m wide and
1.5m high and 735 each 2.2m wide and 1.5m high (see Drawing DG-A-XH3-01-0?).
See Appendix A.3 for a detailed hydraulic calculation.
3.3.5 Connections to other drains
At the upstream and downstream ends the drain connects to existing drains. Upstream in Dien Bien
Phu Street at an invert level of 1.80m; downstream across the Tran Cao Van Street at an invert
level of-0.25m.
At present, run-off and wastewater from the area between Dien Bien Phu Street and the railway
runs through a collection of small drains and open channels to the culvert under the railway. The
new drain will block this flow. A pipe (diameter 500mm) is laid alongside the drain crossing-the
railway; this pipe creates a (temporary) open connection across the railway. In future, a road is
planned along each side of the railway. The run-off and wastewater from the area along the railway
will be collected by the drain along these future roads; these drains are subsequently connected to
the Xuan Hoa drain.
The area downstream from the railway crossing is to be backfilled and developed as a residential
area. As soon as the built-up area is expanded new drains will be connected.
Between chainage 880m and 980m the drain runs parallel to a major drain coming from Chinh
Gian and Xuan Ha wards. This is also the section where the drain runs under the southern side
walk; the other drain runs under the northern side walk. A connection between the two drains will
be made across the road.
3.3.6 Interception of wastewater flows from the drain
The Xuan Ha drain forns the middle part of the Xuan Hoa - Phu Loc drainage system. The drain
will carry both wastewater and stormwater run-off. No diversion of wastewater from this section of
drain is foreseen. However, at the point where water is discharged into Phu Loc River (150m west
of Tran Cao Van Street) a diversion structure and pumping station were foreseen. Because of a
change in the routing of the wastewater pipeline, these were deleted from the ongoing Phase I
project, but will be built in the future. In the calculation of the cross section the influence on the
flow capacity of the diversion structure (weir) has been taken into account.

3.3.7 Special issues
The drainage of the area along route of the new drain is presently provided by an open channel.
Construction of the new box drain in the bedding of the open drain will prevent wastewater and
run-off from this area to be properly evacuated.
It is not recommended to add entry pits for water from this unpaved area to enter the drain because
of the risk of sand and dirt entering the drain. The drain will be easily blocked creating a flooding
risk for the upstream areas.
This situation is temporary since the area north of the railway will be back filled and developed
into a residential area in the near future; the local drainage system will be connected to the new
box drain. The area between Dien Bien Phu Street and the railway will be connected to the
roadside drains of the planned road along the railway; these drains are subsequently connected to
the Xuan Hoa drain.
3.3.8 Geotechnical considerations
Soil in Danang, with soils of (fine) sand, is generally good or very good for the construction of
drains. The additional loads imposed by the new drains on the sub soils are generally very minimal
as in almost all cases the drains replace outcoming soil with similar or higher weights. However,
there are exceptions. Recently, the ongoing project has had to deal with pockets of very muddy soil
that were unsuitable for foundation of drains. These were found in locations where there have
traditionally been rivers or swamps. It was found that roads were constructed over such mud layers
with a sub-base of about 2 m of good soil. During the construction of drains, the good top layer
would be removed and mud started exactly at the base level of the drain.
The Xuan Hoa drain will be almost totally constru'cted in a former river bed and it was suspected
that soft soil conditions might exist. Geotechnical investigations were carried out, therefore, along
the drain alignment. In total 10 SPT tests were made and, for confirmation of the soil types, 5
boreholes were made. The SPT give the best indications regarding bearing capacity of the soil and
they show clearly the thickness of the poor soil layers.
Mud was indeed found, with a thickness generally varying between 0.3 and 1.5 m. At one location
the SPT values increase near the 0.7 level, but then decreased again sharply between 1-2.7 m
below groundlevel.
Taking into account foundation levels of the drain, the drain base would be founded on soil with
sufficient bearing capacity. Occasionally, it may be necessary to remove some additional mud and
replace it with good soil. At the one location with poor sub-soil, some more mud may have to be
replaced with sand. The bill of Quantities made for this drain allows for mud replacement. It is
indicated that the quantities shown in the Bill are provisional and may be changed subject to
approval of the Engineer. The amounts involved in mud replacement are estimated to be only a
few percent of the drain construction costs.
3.4 An Khe drain
3.4.1 Location and justification
The An Khe drain is a large natural channel originating from the western side of the Airport; it
crosses the low lying areas on the western side of An Khe ward and the marsh area in Thanh Loc
Dan ward. The channel terminates at Phu Loc River, behind the Taiwan Textile Factory.
In the near future the City is planning to construct the An Khe cultural park zone in the south-
western part of An Khe ward, thus filling up the natural channel itself and the surrounding low
lying area. Also a large part of the area will be developed as a residential area.

Three interconnected ponds with a total surface area of around 12 ha. will be retained for
stormwater management purposes. The reduction of retention capacity necessitates the increase in
discharge capacity of the downstream channel.
The northern most pond is connected through two culverts crossing the railway to the channel on
the other side. The only available route for the new drain is along the existing channel around the
Taiwan Textile Factory to the Phu Loc River.
3.4.2 Catchment area and design flows
The catchment area of An Khe ponds is around 3 10 ha. and covers the western side of the airport,
the western side of An Khe ward and the southern side of Thanh Loc Dan ward. Since the area is
being gradually redeveloped and increasingly built-up, a run-off coefficient of 0.8 has been
adopted. The ponds have a stormwater regulation function and reduce the peak flow considerably.

Table 3-4 Hydraulic behaviour An Khe ponds
The water level of the lake is kept at 1.00m by a weir at the upstream end of the drain. As
stormwater run-off starts flowing into the lake the water level rises; with the rising level, water
starts to flow out off the lake. The higher the level of the lake, the larger the outflow from the lake.
As long as the inflow to the lake is larger than the outflow, the level continues to rise.
For a 10 year return period the inflow to the lakes has been determined. Also for each 0.1Dm of
raised lake level the outflow has been determined (see Table 3-4).
The level of An Khe pond rises to a maximum of 1.98m before the outflow becomes larger than
the inflow; the maximum stormwater outflow at that moment is 17.96 m3/s

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                      Detailed Design Report
The design flow for the drain at the upstream entry point (railway) is 18.31 m3/s (being the design
stormwater run-off increased with 0.35 m3/s wastewater flow from the upstream area) gradually
increasing to 18.92 m3/s at the downstream end (Phu Loc River).
3.4.3 Alignment and longitudinal profile
The drain connects the stormwater regulation pond south of the railway with the Phu Loc River in
the north. The railway at this point consist of two tracks, one going to Hanoi and one going to Ho
Chi Minh City. Both tracks have two culverts/bridges each where the open stream crosses under
the railway. The eastern culvert is 8m wide; the western culvert is 4m wide.
The outlet from the pond and the connection to the culverts under the southern railway track is the
responsibility of the local PC constructing the pond.
The drain as designed under the additional works program starts at the north side of the Ho Chi
Minh railway track (the southern of the two tracks). Both culverts of the southem track are
connected to the culverts of the northern (Hanoi) track by a short section of drain; each section is
as wide as the culvert (8m respectively 4m).
At the northern side of the Hanoi track the drain runs in an easterly direction along the railway
from the larger culvert to where the smaller culvert joins with the drain. From here the drain turns
northward and then runs along the property boundary of the Taiwan Garment Factory until it
reaches the Phu Loc River
For the entire length the drain lies in open terrain at a slope of 0.1%. Although at present no master
plan for the area exists, at a later stage the area might be developed and a road could be built over
the drain. For a Plan and Profile see Drawing DG-A-AK4-0 1-0 1.
3.4.4 Cross section
The cross section the drain between the eastern 2 culverts is 8m wide and 2m high, while the cross
section the drain between the western 2 culverts is 4m wide and 2m high.
The cross section of the drain from the railway to Phu Loc River consists of one section of 3 x
2.67m wide and 2m high (see Drawing DG-A-AK4-01-0?).
Special attention has been paid to the self scouring ability of the drain during low flow. The floor
of the middle channel has been set at angle so that a V-shape is formed. The cross section in this
part is smaller, thus increasing the depth of flow and velocity under low flow conditions.
See Appendix A.4 for a detailed hydraulic calculation.
3.4.5 Connections to other drains
At the upstream end the drain connects to the culverts under the southern track of the railway. The
invert levels of the culverts are 0.28m for the eastern (8m wide) culvert and 0.30m for the western
(4m wide) culvert. The short sections between the two railway tracks connecting each of the two
culverts continue from these invert levels under a slope of approximately 0.1%.
The invert levels of the culverts under the northern track of the railway are 0.26m for the eastern
(8m wide) culvert and 0.22m for the western (4m wide) culvert.
At the north side of the Hanoi track, the drain will start from the eastern (8m wide) culvert at an
invert level of 0.26m. A lower invert level would result in a too deep invert level at the

downstream end and - because the outflow invert level is below the outside water level - reduce
the flow capacity of the drain; a higher invert level would result in the top of the drain to be above
the surface level of the surrounding area and in effect reduce the flow capacity of the drain.
After running west for approximately I OOm the western (4m wide) culvert connects to the drain.
The invert level at the outflow to the Phu Loc River - approximately 600m downstream - is
-0.34m. In between the drain does not cross other drains.
The outfall to the Phu Loc River consists of a two channel sluice gate which has fallen into
disrepair. This gate is replaced by a proper outfall structure with a trash rack and tidal weir,
3.4.6 Interception of wastewater flows from the drain
The new box drain forms the final section of the An Khe - Phu Loc drainage system. For the
foreseeable future the drain will carry both wastewater and stormwater run-off. However, since the
drain forms the outlet for a number of retention ponds, wastewater should not be allowed to enter
these ponds in the first place. Wastewater generated upstream from the ponds should be
intercepted and diverted to a treatment plant before it enters the ponds.
Not knowing at which point wastewater flows will be intercepted, a diversion structure and
pumping station have been reckoned with at the point where water is discharged into Phu Loc
River. In the calculation of the cross section the influence on the flow capacity of such a diversion
structure (weir) has been taken into account. At this point in time, however, no diversion structure
will be constructed and no wastewater will be intercepted.
3.4.7 Special issues
Special attention should be paid to the outflow structures of the pond i.e. the inflow structure to the
drain. Since considerable amounts of water have to pass over the weir the length should be
sufficient for the water surface of the pond not rise too much.
At the time of writing this report the outfall structures of the pond had not yet been constructed.
The level of the outfall weir was subsequently not known.
Therefore a weir has been integrated into the design at the upstream entrance to the drain; i.e. at the
north side of the railway where the culverts connect to the drain. The width of the weir is set at
12m; this is the width of both culverts together. The height of the weir is set at +1.OOm.
With a weir of these dimensions the water level will not exceed 2m for an event with a return
period of 10 years. With a level of the surrounding area of between 2.5m and 4.5m this leaves
enough freeboard.
Should, at the time of construction of the drain, the outfalls of the pond already be constructed and
should the level of that weir be not lower than +1.OOm while the width is not less than 12m the
weir at the entrance to the drain can be dispensed with.
At the moment, low-income residences and home-businesses along the drain discharge their
wastewater directly to the low lying area through which the existing open channel flows; also local
stormwater run-off flows through the open channel to the Phu Loc River.
Construction of the new box drain in the bedding of the open drain will prevent wastewater and
run-off from this area to be properly evacuated.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                       Detailed Design Report
It is not recommended to add entry pits for water from this unpaved area to enter the drain because
of the risk of sand and dirt entering the drain. The drain will be easily blocked creating a flooding
risk for the upstream areas.
It is not clear if or when the area north of the railway will be back filled and developed into a
residential or industrial area. Considering the development of other areas in Danang, it seems
highly likely that this area will at some point be back filled and further developed.
In the mean time, water from the area will collect around the new drain and soak into the sandy
soil. Although this is not an optimal situation, the risk of damage is negligible since there are no
structures in the low lying area and the amounts of water are small.
Another point of attention is the bamboo bridge crossing the open stream. The top level of the box
drain is around 0.5m higher than the present level of the bridge. The access ramp should be raised
and the top of the drain should be made suitable for crossing with motorbikes. On either side of the
drain the access ramps should be fitted with a small culvert (diameter 500mm) for local drainage to
be able to pass.
3.4.8 Geotechnical considerations
Soil in Danang, with soils of (fine) sand, is generally good or very good for the construction of
drains. The additional loads imposed by the new drains on the sub soils are generally very minimal
as in almost all cases the drains replace outcoming soil with similar or higher weights.
The An Khe drain will be almost totally constructed in a former river bed and it was suspected that
soft soil conditions rnight exist. Geotechnical investigations were carried out, therefore, along the
drain alignment. In total 6 SPT tests were made and 2 boreholes. The SPT give the best indications
regarding bearing capacity of the soil and they show clearly the thickness of any poor soil layers.
It was found that SPT values were generally high and no soil improvement would be required.
However, at one location, representing approx. 150-175 m of the drain alignment, mud was-found
up to 3.6 m below ground level. As at this location, the drain will be built with a base at approx the
same as the existing groundlevel, up to 5,300 m3 of mud may have to be replaced. The bill of
Quantities made for this drain allows for mud replacement.
3.5 My Khe drain
3.5.1 Location options considered
The drainage system in Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son districts is not clearly established. In the
districts' area there are only few drains, located mainly in new residential areas.
Waste- and stormwater from residential areas along East Bach Dang Street discharges directly to
the Han River through drains from Ngo Quyen Street connecting to East Bach Bang Street.
Similarly waste- and stormwater from the area west of Ngu Hanh Son Street is discharged directly
to the Han River.
All waste- and stormwater from residential areas east of Ngo Quyen/Ngu Hanh Son Streets is
discharged to the natural low land of the catchment; this low land is situated between the elevated
area just behind the beach (dunes) and the raised carriageway of Ngo Quyen/Ngu Hanh Son
Streets.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                      Detailed Design Report
An outfall connecting the low lying area with the sea is situated between Nguyen Van Thoai Street
and the My Khe Beach Hotels. The invert level of this drain, however, lies considerably higher
than the area it is supposed to drain. The result is that during the rainy season the low area turns
into a series of small lakes; during the dry season the area is returned to a sewage filled swamp.
In the northeast of Ngu Hanh Son district a natural watercourse originates from Nguyen Van Thoai
Street and runs to the back of the Furama resort where it empties to the sea. This watercourse,
however, suffers from heavy siltation and clogging resulting in a high invert level and small cross-
section, and thus limited drainage capacity.
As a result of the limited and poor opportunities for discharging waste- and stormwater out of the
area, new residential areas - although they have a local drainage system - are regularly affected by
flooding.
To address drainage problems in the southeast of Son Tra and the northeast of Ngu Hanh Son
several options have been explored. The areas in Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son are discussed in
conjunction because - even though they lie in different districts - hydraulically they form one area.
This area will be backfilled to a minimum level of +2.50m and developed into a residential area.
The natural orientation of the drainage is towards the lowest points in the area, about 500m inland
from the beach. Along the centre of this low lying area - in north-south direction - a major drain
will be constructed. The drain starts at Nguyen Cong Tru Street and runs all the way down to Ho
Xuan Huong Street past the Furama Resort along the planned road designated by the temporary
name of Number 4 Street.
The drainage options for the area differ in the way the water is discharged to the surface water: to
the sea in the east or to the river in the west.
Option 1: Discharge to My Khe Beach.
Wastewater from main drain is discharged to My Khe Beach by three outlets.
Outlet 1 is the same as the existing one between Nguyen Van Thoai Street and the My Khe Beach
Hotels; however, the invert of the drain is lowered and the cross-section of the drain is enlarged to
7.5m wide by 2m high. The outfall will receive most of the waste- and stormwater of the
catchment east of Ngo Quyen Street between Nguyen Cuong Tru Street and south of Nguyen Van
Thoai Street.
Outlet 2 is new and runs along the north boundary of the Sao Paolo Monastery. The dimension of
the outlet drain is 7.5m wide and 2.Om high. The outfall will receive most of the waste- and
stormwater of the catchment east of Ngu Hanh Son Street between south of Nguyen Van Thoai
Street and north of Ho Xuan Huong Street.
Outlet 3 runs along the same route as the existing natural watercourse to the south of the Furama
Resort. The dimension of the outlet drain is 5.0m wide and 2.Om high. The outfall will receive
most of the waste- and stormwater of the catchment east of Ngu Hanh Son Street between north of
Ho Xuan Huong Street and the Furama Resort.
Advantages: Two of the three outlets follow the route of existing drains. All the outlet drains
follow the shortest route to the surface water. Consequently the invert levels and cross-sections of
the drains remain within limits.
Disadvantages: My Khe beach already attracts many local and international tourists and is to be
further developed into a high class tourist attraction. Construction of outfalls at these locations will
cause pollution of the beach area. Debris will give the beach an unattractive sight; wastewater
overflows will create unsafe swimming water due to pathogens.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                     Detailed Design Report
Option 2: Discharge to the Han River.
In this option, waste- and stormwater from the main drain is evacuated in westerly direction
towards the Han River.
The collected water from the north end of the drain is discharged through a drain (8.Om wide by
2.Om high) along Nguyen Cong Tru Street; discharge through the Le Huu Trac Street is no longer
an option since the recent construction of a large drain with a slope towards the beach away from
the river.
Water from the middle part of the drain is discharged along the Phan Tu Street by a lO.Om wide by
2.Om high drain.
A 7.5m wide by 2.Om wide drain along the Ho Xuan Huong Street discharges the water from the
south end of the main drain.
Advantages: No waste- or stormwater will be discharged along My Khe beach reducing the risk of
pollution of the prized tourist area.
Disadvantages: The construction cost is considerably higher than Option I due to the greater
length of drains as well as the large construction depth necessary to cross the relative high level of
the Ngo Quyen/Ngu Hanh Son Streets carriageway. Also, the water level of the river is higher than
that of the sea resulting in flatter hydraulic gradients and thus requiring bigger drains. Moreover,
although the Han River is not used for swimming, debris will reduce the attractiveness of the
boulevard being constructed all along the river.
Recommendation: Based on the above advantages and limitations, specifically the high
construction cost of Option 2, Option 1 - to construct the outfalls towards the beach - is chosen.
The negative impacts of Option 1 on the environment can mostly be mitigated by constructing
trash capture devices upstream of outfalls as well as wastewater interceptors (also see paragraph
5.4). The beach cleaning machines purchased in the framework of this project will deal with any
debris passing the trash capture devices and inadvertently cast from the outfalls. Finally, pathogens
can survive in salt water for only a very short time, much shorter than in fresh water.
3.5.2 Catchment area and design flows
The catchment area of the My Khe drain is bounded in the north by Pham Van Dong Street and in
the south by the old military airfield. The western boundary is formed by the raised carriageway of
Ngo Quyen/Ngu Hanh Son Streets and the eastern boundary is formed by the East Sea. The total
drainage area amounts to about 330ha.
Around 120ha. is drained through the My Khe Beach Hotel outfall, 123ha. through the Sao Paolo
Monastery outfall, and 88ha. through the Furama Resort outfall.
The design flow of the north section of the main drain between Nguyen Cong Tru Street and the
beginning of the My Khe Outfall increases from 6 m3/s to a maximum of 12 m3/s.
The design flow for south section of the drain to the My Khe Outfall varies between 4 m3/s to a
maximum of 11 m3/s.
The My Khe Beach outlet drain is designed for a flow of around 23 m3/s.
For the north section connecting to the St. Paolo Monastery the design flow increases from 6 m3/s
to a maximum of 13 m3/s, with the flow from the south section varies from 5 m3/s to a maximum
of 11 m3/s.
The St. Paolo Monastery outlet drain itself is designed for a flow of around 24 m3/s.
Finally, the Furama section of the main drain is designed for a flow of 5 m3/s up to 15 m3/s.

3.5.3 Alignment and longitudinal profile
In the past, development of the area was more or less unstructured. At the present a master plan is
being implemented. This master plan implies a new road grid; also a number of additional roads
are being built.
Implementing a new road grid in an already developed area results in the relocation of a
considerable number of people. The construction of the main drainage system should not add to
these numbers. Therefore the My Khe drain will in principle follow the new road grid of the
current master plan for the area.
At the north end of the drain - between Nguyen Cong Tru Street and the My Khe Beach Hotel
outfall, the planned road goes through a built-up area. An alternative route for the drain is
suggested to minirnise the number of affected people. This route goes along an existing pathway
and through the low lying swampy area, and lies approximately 80m to the west of the planned
road.
Since the resettlement process for the people affected by the new road alignment has not started
yet the designed alignment for the drain in this section is along the path that requires the least
resettlement and affects the least number of people.
The middle section of the drain - between the My Khe Beach Hotel outfall and the Sao Paolo
Monastery outfall - goes through a more or less empty area; no or very little resettlement for the
new road grid is foreseen. The drain will follow the planned road along this section.
At the south end of the drain - south of the Sao Paolo Monastery outfall - population densities are
relatively high. 'The newly planned roads in the area between Ba Huyen Thanh Quan Strerst and Ho
Xuan Huong Street are designed through this densely built-up area. Because of relocation issues,
the World Bank could not agree with this alignment and therefore this section of the drain has been
removed from the additional works program. The section south of Ba Huyen Thanh Quan Street to
the Furama Resort outfall could still be built at a later stage under the direction of and funding by
the City.
3.5.4 Cross section
Table 3-5 shows the dimensions of the cross-sections for the My Khe drain. The box drain consists
of 2 or 3 flow-channels each varying in width between 2 and 3 meter (total widths varying between
4m and 9m). The height of the drain is kept at 1.5 meter over the complete length because this will
keep the invert of the outfall above the level of +0.60m; thus a tidal weir is not necessary. A higher
invert level of the outfalls also improves the evacuation of stormwater run-off over the beach to the
sea. The feasibility study calculated a drain height for the outfalls of 2m; the lower height of 1. 5m
requires the drain to be around 20% wider than originally calculated.

For a detailed hydraulic calculation see Appendix A.4.
3.5.5 Connections to other drains
At the north end the My Khe drain connects to the drain along Nguyen Cuong Tru Street and the
drain coming from the north.
At the south end it connects to the drain along Ba Huyen Thanh Quan Street.
At a later stage the extended southward section will connect to the drain along Ho Xuan Huong
Street.
In between, all drains running west-east will be connected since it is the main drain for the entire
area i.e. the drains in Le Huu Trac Street, Nguyen Duy Hieu Street, Nguyen Van Thoai Street and
Phan Tu Street.
All drains along the new coastal road to be constructed between Nguyen Cuong Tru Street and Ho
Xuan Huong Street are to discharge towards one of the outfalls and not directly to sea.
3.5.6 Interception of wastewater flows from the drain
The drain has only two outlets to the sea. At a later stage another outlet will be added south of the
Furama Resort. There are no other outlets along this stretch of coastline. At these outlets the
wastewater will be intercepted and pumped to the Ngu Hanh Son wastewater treatment plant (see
paragraph 5.4).
3.5.7 Special issues
Resettlement issues have played an important part in the alignment and extend of the My Khe
drain. At the north end of the drain an alignment has been chosen which minimises the number of
project affected people. However, it should be noted that, if the alignment of the planned road
remains unaltered and the drain is laid along the here proposed alignment more people will be
affected than if the drain is laid along the same alignment as the proposed road.
Both alignments should be in tune with each other and this should be co-ordinated by the relevant
authorities notably the Danang People's Committee.
3.5.8 Geotechnical considerations
Soil in Danang, with soils of (fine) sand, is generally good or very good for the construction of
drains. The additional loads imposed by the new drains on the sub soils are generally very minimal
as in almost all cases the drains replace outcoming soil with similar or higher weights.
The My Khe drain will be partly constructed in a swamp and, although the soil conditions in the
area are known to be good, geotechnical investigations were carried out in the swamp area. In total
4 SPT tests were made and 2 boreholes. The SPT give the best indications regarding bearing
capacity of the soil and they show clearly the thickness of any poor soil layers.
It was found that SPT values were generally high with less than 0.5 m of mud. At one location, the
mud layer was a little higher, but sub-soils below the initial mud was found to be very good.
Some mud will have to removed, however, and the Bill of Quantities allows for this.

4 WASTEWATER COLLECTION - GENERAL
4.1 Introduction
4.1.1 Existing situation
At present all wastewater is discharged into the surface water untreated.
Under the Danang Sanitation subproject funded by the IDA, wastewater of four districts: Hai
Chau, Thanh Khe, Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son will be collected and transferred to four WWTPs:
Hoa Cuong, Phu Loc, Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son. In the following paragraph a brief description
of the ongoing works in each catchment area is given.
4.1.2 Construction of wastewater collection system under WB (IDA) project
Hoa Cuong WWTPcatchment
All wastewater of catchments II, III, IV and part of VII (see paragraph 2.1. I for a description of
these catclunents) will be treated at Hoa Cuong WWTP. Wastewater is to be collected by GID and
pumped by SPS12, SPS13, SPS14 and SPS15 on Bach Dang - 2/9 Street to the WWTP. In the
future, wastewater of the entire catchment VII and catchment VIII will be treated in this WWTP.
Hoa Cuong WWTP is constructed in Hoa Cuong area in the south-west of the city. The treatment
consists of two anaerobic lagoons with floating covers to enhance the treatment process, and to
collect gas in order to prevent the spread of bad smell.
Phu Loc WWTP catchment
Phu Loc WWTP will treat wastewater of catchments I, V and VI. A GID system and pumps SPS 18
in Dam Rong Lake I, SPS19 and SPS20 on Lien Chieu - Thuan Phuoc road, SPS31 in 29/3 Lake
park and SPS21 in Phu Loc river will collect and transfer wastewater to the WWTP. In phase II,
the WWTP will be upgraded to include the catchment XIII of Lien Chieu district.
Phu Loc WWTP is constructed in Hoa Minh ward, Lien Chieu district. The treatment consists of
two anaerobic lagoons as well, also with floating covers.
Son Tra WWTP catchment
Wastewater in catchment IX and X of Son Tra district will be treated in Son Tra WWTP. GIDs are
constructed along East Bach Dang Street and along the coast in Man Thai and Phuoc My wards. A
system of pumps and rising mains (SPS1, SPS2, SPS8, and SPS9) conveys the wastewater to the
treatment plant.
The WWTP is constructed in Tho Quang ward, Son Tra district. Wastewater is treated in two
anaerobic lagoons. Floating covers are provided in the framework of the additional works program.
Ngu Hanh Son WWTP catchment
Ngu Hanh Son WWTP will treat wastewater from catchments XI and XII of Ngu Hanh Son
district. Wastewater will be collected along the Han River and along the beach from My Khe to the
Furama resort, and transferred to Ngu Hanh Son treatment plant by pumps and rising mains.
The WWTP will be constructed in Hoa Hai commune, Ngu Hanh Son district. Wastewater is
treated by two anaerobic lagoons. Here as well, floating covers are provided in the framework of
the additional works program.

4.1.3 Wastewater systems in additional works programme
After the completion of the ongoing Phase I project, most of the crowded residential areas will
have at their disposal a wastewater collection system. As is mentioned in the feasibility study,
however, due to rapid city development in the years since the inception of the Phase 1 project,
expansion of the systems described above is necessary to protect the Han River and My Khe Beach
areas for further environmental degradation. Because of the development as an entertainment and
recreational area of 2/9 street and the urbanisation of the area around Pham Van Dong Street and
south of Tran Ly Bridge, extensions of the wastewater collection system have been identified for
Hoa Cuong, Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son catchment areas.
In addition to the works identified in the feasibility study, a number of works from the ongoing
Phase 1 project have been redesigned and included in this report. Partly due to budget constraint in
the ongoing contract 013 and partly due to design issues and opportunities to save costs, a number
of works have been exchanged between ongoing contract 013 and the additional works contract
020 (also see Chapter 6).
Hoa Cuong WWTP catchment
The feasibility study has identified a gravity interceptor drain along the south end of 2/9 Street
(between Duy Tan Street and Tuyen Son Bridge), including a pumping station and a rising main to
the Hoa Cuong treatment plant.
Although the concept of GID and SPS remained, the detailed design presented in this report
deviates from the design presented in the feasibility study. Integrating the wastewater collection
system for this area with the ongoing Phase 1 project proved to produce both a technica.ly and a
financially much more attractive solution.
All additional works along 2/9 Street have been included in the ongoing contract 013.
Son Tra WWTP catchment
The feasibility study has identified a gravity interceptor drain along the middle coastal stretch of
Phuoc My ward (between Nguyen Cong Tru Street and Man Thai ward), including a pumping
station and a rising main to the Son Tra treatment plant.
In addition to the wastewater collection systems identified in the feasibility study for the Son Tra
WWTP catchment area, this report also discusses the wastewater collection system along Man
Thai fishing village included in the ongoing Phase 1 works. The situation along this fishing village
has changed since the time of the original design. At the moment a coastal road is being
constructed along the eastern seaboard. Construction has started several kilometres north of the
village. Within a year the road is expected to pass the village. This creates better possibilities for a
GID system - which was originally rejected - since a wide area is being cleared along the beach
for this road.
The wastewater collection system has been redesigned and integrated with the wastewater
collection system of the additional works area between Nguyen Cong Tru Street and Man Thai
ward.

The wastewater collection system along Man Thai fishing village remains part of ongoing contract
013 while the wastewater collection system between Nguyen Cong Tru Street and Man Thai ward
is part of the additional works contract 020.
Ngu Hanh Son WWTP catchment
The feasibility study has identified a gravity interceptor drain along the Han River embankment of
northwest Bac My An ward (between Tran Thi Ly bridge and Tuyen Son bridge), including a
pumping station and a rising main to the Ngu Hanh Son treatment plant.
In addition to the wastewater collection systems identified in the feasibility study for the Ngu Hanh
Son WWTP catchment area this report also covers the interception of wastewater along the
southern coastal stretch of Phuoc My ward and the northern coastal stretch of Bac My An ward
(from Nguyen Cong Tru Street to the Furama Resort).
This latter system was originally part of the ongoing Phase 1 works and consisted of a number of
GIDs along the coast. However, due to the inclusion of the large main drain of the area in the
additional works program (see paragraph 3.5) the possibility arose to develop a technically and a
financially more attractive alternative.
The wastewater collection system between Nguyen Cong Tru Street to the Furama Resort is
removed from the ongoing contract 013 and will be part of the additional works contract 020, as is
the wastewater collection system between Tran Thi Ly bridge and Tuyen Son bridge
4.2  Design criteria
As for the (combined) stormwater drains, GHD -Kinhill developed a number of design criteria
during the engineering study for the ongoing Phase, I project, for the wastewater collection system.
The Ministry of Construction and the World Bank approved the designed system based on these
design criteria.
Since the additional works program is a supplement to the ongoing Phase 1 works, also here in
principle the same design criteria have been applied.
4.2.1 Basic concept of GIDs, Pumping stations and Rising Mains
The first step in introducing a wastewater collection system to an already developed area is to
intercept the dry weather flow (dwf) before it has a chance to enter the surface water.
During the engineering study for the ongoing Phase I project, GHD-Kinhill designed a wastewater
collection system consisting of gravity interceptor drains (GID), sewage pumping stations (SPS)
and rising mains (RM). Although this system intercepts most of the wastewater, it still allows
overflows of a mixture of wastewater and stormwater run-off during precipitation; it is, however
the least-cost solution with the highest initial impact.
The Ministry of Construction and the World Bank approved the designed system.
The design foresees in a basic first stage system, with wastewater pipelines (GIDs and RMs) in
principle only along the Bay of Danang, the Han River and China Beach (My Khe Beach).
Wastewater (and stormwater) flows in the direction of the nearest surface waters through existing
and/or new drains. Just upstream of the outfalls to the. surface water, special diversion structures
are built that intercept a minimal flow from these drains and transport them through a combination
of small and relatively steep graded GIDs, submersible type SPSs and RMs to the wastewater
treatment plants.

Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project                         Additional Works Program
Danang Sub-project (Phase I)                                       Detailed Design Report
In principle this wastewater collection system is designed such that during dry periods, the
complete flow in the drains, supposed to be wastewater, will be intercepted and diverted to the
wastewater treatment plants. The wastewater collection system cannot handle very large flows, so
during storms, the excess flows in the drains will discharge into the surface waters.
4.2.2 Design peak factor
It is common practice to design wastewater collection systems by taking into account estimated
average wastewater flows and then applying a certain peak factor. The peak factor allows for the
system to cope with variations in the flow during the day, as most of the daily wastewater flows
are produced during peak hours, usually around 06.00 and 18.00 h each day. By applying the peak
factor, the wastewater collection system will be able to cope with peak flows during "rush hours",
as well as of the unavoidable errors in the estimation of wastewater flows. However, applying a
large peak factor means also that during "off peak" periods the system has a large unused capacity.
GHD-Kinhill, in its designs, has used a peak factor of 1.2, much lower than the usual typical
design factor of 2.5 to 5. The lower peak factor was selected based on measured average and peak
dry weather flows in 13 existing major drains in Danang. It arises from a combination of the flow
buffering in septic tanks and the extremely flat low-lying topography and hence flat graded drains
in Danang. In addition, it was assumed that any higher than expected peaks could be buffered in
the large storage created by the tidal weirs.
The direct result of the lowered peak factor is a fuller utilization of the unused "off-peak" capacity
in the system. Pipelines and pump stations are now 83% (100/1.2) utilised compared to 20% to
40% in conventionally designed systems. That is, with the selected system, more than double the
population can be served by this system, compared to a conventionally designed system of the
same cost.
This approach created a wastewater system that allowed the service area to include most of all four
wastewater catchments in the project with relative limited funding.
4.2.3 Implications of the adopted design criteria
As it is not desirable to alter the design criteria at this stage, especially where they were approved
by all and have led to an affordable cost effective system, CMC, in adjusting the design
calculations of the ongoing works to the new field conditions, have also applied the design criteria
(and notably the very small peak factor) listed above.
Since the additional works program is a supplement to the ongoing Phase 1 works, also here the
same design criteria have been applied.
However, the implications of these design criteria should be well understood by all parties, to
avoid disappointment with the system once it is completed (with chances that actual conditions
vary adversely from design assumptions). Some implications are:
1. The wastewater collection system is designed using the year 2010 as a design horizon.
That is very short for a system that will not be completed until about the year 2004.
2. Using the low peak factor could imply that, at outfalls connected to drains with less buffer
capacity, there is a higher risk that wastewater is discharged during peak hours, say during
a number of hours per day.
3. Similarly at outfalls in drains serving areas with rapid population growth there is a higher
risk that a permanent overflow of wastewater from the diversion structures will occur

prematurely, as the system can only cope with an average excess flow of 20% above the
estimated flows.
4. As precise estimation of wastewater flows (and groundwater flows infiltrating into the
drains), is difficult, it is possible that average flows could be either smaller or larger than
estimated. If they are significantly larger there is risk of premature overflow occurrences at
some outfalls. If premature overflow occurs for whatever reason and it is deemed
unacceptable, additional wastewater collection capacity will have to be installed, and this
could be relatively soon after completion of the project. The overflow from a relatively
new system may cause disappointment, but is a direct result of budget limitations and the
chosen strategy. If it occurs, it should not be forgotten that the system was very cost
effective and that early stage development of the system was implied.
5. If average flows are estimated precisely (which is impossible), the pumping stations,
designed with peak factor 1.2, would have to pump out wastewater on average during
100/1.2 = 83% of the time. If wastewater flows are higher than estimated, the SPS will
soon operate 100% of the time. Although this is efficient, it decreases the technical
lifetime of the pump due to increased wear and tear. It should be noted that, because of
standby pumps, actual pump running hours would be less. For example, an SPS with I
pump will be equipped with one standby pump and a, say 100% SPS running time, would
be equally shared by the two pumps, so pump running hours would not exceed 50% (12
hours per day). On the other hand, the pumps of an SPS with 3 duty pumps and I standby
would be running 75% of the time (i.e. 18 hours).
4.2.4 Domestic wastewater flows
Domestic wastewater flows are calculated based on a combination of per capita consumption for
either population connected to the existing water supply or those not connected to the water
supply, a percentage of the water supply being discharged as wastewater and a peak factor (see
Table 4-1).
Year    2000     2010      2020
I/cap.d W/S:    130       180      200
w w-factor:    0.85      0.90     0.95
I/cap.d non W/S:    50        50       50
w w-factor:    0.80      0.80     0.80
peak factor     1.2      1.2       1.2
Table 4-1 Domestic wastewater criteria
The wastewater factor accounts for the fact that not all water supplied ends up as wastewater.
The peak factor accounts for the fact that wastewater is not produced evenly over the day; this is
fuirther discussed in paragraph 4.2.2.
4.2.5 Non-domestic flows
The non-domestic wastewater flows are taken as a percentage of the domestic wastewater flow.
Distinction is made between wastewater from industries and wastewater from services such as
hotels and restaurants. These percentages have been assessed for each sub-catchment area. Table
4-2 shows the weighted average for all catchment areas.

4.2.6 Interception of wastewater from drains
As mentioned in paragraph 2.2.5 drains in Danang carry both wastewater and stormwater.
At each point where a GID crosses a drain, a wastewater interceptor is constructed which diverts
the wastewater from the drain to the GID.
The aim of the flow diversion structures is to:
* Collect all the DWF from major stormwater channels, culverts and drains
* Exclude trash and floatables without blockage
* Pass grit and sediment without blockage
* Avoid overflows from GIDs
The exclusion of trash and floatables will minimise blockage risks to both pumping stations and
pipelines. In addition it will minimise occupational health and safety risks. All trash clearing and
any necessary blockage clearing can be carried out in relatively open and shallow pits. The need
for access to enclosed spaces, particularly deep enclosed spaces will be subsequently reduced and
only be required for relatively infrequent maintenance purposes.
Grit accumulation in the system, especially during storm events, will be unavoidable and the
structures have been designed to continuously transfer grit to a centralised collection point at the
wastewater treatment plant; this is deemed as the most effective handling means.
However, if large grit quantities prove troublesome in operation, intermediate grit traps can be
constructed later as necessary. These traps can be located in the stormwater drains immediately
upstream of the intake diversion structure and/or at rising main discharge point s and will reduce
(but not completely eliminate) the problem, albeit at additional operational costs.
The diversion structures comprise a grated collection pit and a special arrangement at either a
manhole or pumping station in the GID system.
* The diversion structures are positioned in the floor of the major stormwater channels or
drains. Interception of DWF at any other points, say from pits in side drains, will have a
low capture efficiency and present major operational blockage risks
* The grates are recessed 200mm below the drain invert level to ensure maximum capture
efficiency, and provide operating buffer storage for pump operation and trash collection.
*  Where existing stormwater drain invert levels are below +0.6m at the diversion point weirs
are provided to a level of +0.6m. This "tidal barrier" prevents back flow from river or sea
in all but high tide and flood situations. The weir length is set so that the maximum depth
of water over the weir is 0.5m; this to minimise the impact on the normal hydraulic
performance of the drain at maximum design flow.
* Hinged grated cover, with grates to a "toothed comb" design, are provide for ease of
maintenance. This is a standardised 20Us modular size and can be economically fabricated
in Vietnam.

*  The grating has a spacing of 40mm. This is to minimise blockage risks to all pipeworks and
pumps.
*  Grating is permanently submerged and has very low flow through velocity to ensure trash
and floatables remain floating above the grate. This reduces tendencies for debris to
accumulate on the grate, be partially sucked through it or wrap around it. In this way
blockage risks are minimised and the easily rakeable floating debris will allow quicker
cleaning with reduced difficulty.
*  In the base of the collection pit a carefully shaped concrete shaped bench throat to the
outlet pipe is applied to limit large objects getting into the outlet pipe and the pumping
station.
*  A maximum 5 metre long outlet pipe between the diversion and the pumping station
without bends or fittings is applied and sized to achieve high scouring velocities on pump
operation so that pipe blockage risks are very small.
The integration of the DWF diversion structure with the stormwater drain trash removal structure
requires daily manual cleaning of accumulated trash. The trash removal should be an extension of
the existing solid waste, street sweeping and garbage collection service.
4.2.7 Pipe sizes and slopes
The Vietnamese MOC minimum pipe diameter for a storm water system is 300mmn. However, for
the GID system a minimum diameter of 200mm is adopted. Unlike stormwater drains or combined
drain systems, the GIDs will be totally enclosed with entry only via house connections that have a
maximum diameter of 100mm or via diversion structures that have 40mm gratings to prevent
larger objects from entering.
While blockage risks from large objects decreases with larger diameters, for given flows the
blockage risks from siltation increases with oversized pipes.
For new dry weather flow diversion works and GIDs, siltation problems must be avoided by
ensuring self cleansing velocities and grades. This is essential because:
* Environmental, aesthetic and public health consequences of GID blockage are generally
more severe than stormwater drain blockages,
* Difficulty and cost of unblocking GEDs is much higher than for stormwater drains;
* Occupational health and safety risks to maintenance personnel are increased with increased
risk of blockages.
To preserve the condition and capacity of the pipelines wherever practicable, minimum grades at
or steeper than the self cleansing grade should be adopted. The grades must be sufficient to prevent
sediment build-up and, if possible, also prevent slime growth on pipe walls. Self cleansing flow
conditions must be attained at least daily during dry weather at all points within the wastewater
collection system.
Additional flushing capacity is not available in wet weather conditions as GIDs are not meant to
carry stormwater. Pipe diameter selection in the wastewater system for self cleansing must be
achieved under dry weather flow conditions only.
The criteria for minimum grades have a direct impact on the excavation depth of the pipeline and
thus the cost of construction. The system is designed for the year 2010; flows in the initial years

after construction will be much lower than the design flows. Requiring self cleansing grades at
these low flows will result in extremely steep grades.
No grading advantage to reduce pipeline depths is possible by selecting larger diameters.
A practical compromise is a grade where the minimum shear stress required for self cleansing is
achieved assuming full pipe flow. The standard Vietnamese MOC formula for self cleansing grade
of 1 in D (pipe diameter in millimetre) reasonably achieves this sheer stress.
Table 4-3 shows the pipe size used in the detailed design and the minimum grade at which they are
to be laid.

Table 4-3 Pipe sizes and minimum grades
4.2.8 Pipe types, bedding
There is a range of pipe materials available for GlDs. Suitable materials include reinforced
concrete, ductile iron, vitrified clay, and a range of plastic materials such as uPVC, HDPE and
ABS.
Neither reinforced concrete nor vitrified clay GID pipelines are recommended because there is
unlikely to significant cost advantage; and adequate "in-ground" construction quality can not be
guaranteed (in particular the water tightness of the in-ground pipelines) in Vietnamese conditions.
Ductile iron is not recommended because of the likely higher costs and increased susceptibility to
corrosion.
Plastic materials are the preferred materials because of lower costs, resistance to corrosion, product
quality control and smooth bores (which are a major advantage in reducing grades and blockage
risks).
Of the available plastic materials uPVC could be used for GIDs up to a diameter of 315mm. For
GIDs with a diameter of 400-630mm the material of choice is HDPE since uPVC is generally not
available in large diameter. As more recently, the price differences between HDPE and PVC have
become much smaller, HDPE is the preferred material for all pipe sizes, in the Additional works.
Reasons are its flexibility, better UV-resistance, better capability to withstand mishandling and less
problems with joints (once they are made). The maximum diameter applied in this project 800mm.
This pipe is made of a special ribbed HDPE.
HPDE is also the material of choice for rising mains of all diameters on the grounds of continuity
(avoiding the need for thrust blocks), ability to flex around curves (reducing the need and cost of
fittings) and lower friction losses.
It is essential that when the pipe is laid in the ground that it is properly "cradled" or "bedded" in
uniform compacted granular material (usually coarse sand) and carefully backfilled and

compacted. This is to ensure the integrity of the pipe shape and structure is maintained for the
operational life time of the pipeline.
4.2.9 Maximum depth
With the flat terrain of Danang and the location of the GIDs parallel to the shore or river
embankment, the interceptor drains have the potential to become very deep very quickly. This
necessity for deep construction is an unavoidable characteristic of wastewater pipe systems in flat
areas and is a distinguishing feature from other pipeline and cable utility systems which are
invariably constructed as shallow as possible.
With depth the cost of the pipeline increases greatly. For example there is typically 'about a
threefold increase in unit pipeline costs from a pipeline at minimum depth to one about 5 meters
depth.
In addition, construction difficulties increase exponentially with depth, particularly when the
excavation depth is in soft ground and below the permanent water table. This situation is common
in Danang.
The typical characteristics of deep excavation are:
*  Requirement of continuous trench support including the need for piling;
*  Requirement for continuous pumping;
*  Collapsed ground behind trench supports;
*  Risks to existing services (e.g. exposed water main);
*  Unstable ground conditions at the base of excavation;
*  Extent of excavation, spoil heaps and construction area requirements.
The unavoidable consequences during construction of deep pipelines are major social disruption,
dislocation and consequential community costs.
The advantage of having pipelines go to a greater depth is that fewer pumps are required. However
the cost advantage of having fewer pumps does not countervail against the extra cost associated
with the deeper excavation depth; for example, with a maximum depth of about 7 to 8 meters it is
possible to halve the number of pumping stations but the overall capital costs are doubled. Also,
hardly any power cost economics are to be gained since the same volume of wastewater is pumped
the same net distance against the same net lift.
The maximum excavation depth for GIDs is consequently set at 5m.
4.2.10 GIED manholes
In order to be able to carry out maintenance on the drain, inlets are provided at regular intervals of
0oom for a person and/or equipment to enter the drain. These manholes comprise a pit of minimum
1,000mm diameter for person access, provide for inspection and emergency cleaning and blockage
clearing.
Another major function of manholes is to provide house connection points of entry since no
connections should be made directly to the GID; this to reduce the risk of damage to the GID.
Covers are to be sealed to prevent entry of stormwater and egress of odours. Covers are also fitted
with a locking device to prevent unauthorised entry.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                      Detailed Design Report
GID manholes are carefully benched and channelled at the base, at dropper pipes and base bends
on incoming connections, and at branch drains. This is to minimise turbulence in the flows and
build-up of sediment in "dead zones"; it will also minimise odour generation and asset
deterioration from evolved gasses.
No climbing steps will be provided. Entry is strictly limited to specialised personnel only, that will
use special equipment to enter any manholes, if it cannot be avoided.
4.2.11 GIID connection points
Since the GIDs are deep and mostly at or below the permanent ground water table, the retrofitting
of property connection points will be very costly and lead to risk of damage and permanent
groundwater leaks into the pipeline. In a wastewater collection system it is essential that the water
tightness of the pipeline system is maintained at all times.
This to avoid prejudicing system capacity and reduces the running cost of unnecessary pumping
and treatment.
Accordingly, all property connection points are constructed as an integral part of the initial
pipeline construction. All new or redeveloped properties should be required to connect to only
these connection points. Connection points are located at a maximum of lOOm intervals.
With an interval of GID manholes of lOOm and an interval of GID connection points of lOOm the
maximum distance from properties to a point of connection to the GID is 25m
4.2.12 Vent poles
Vent poles from GID manholes are positioned at the head of every GID and from manholes that
receive rising main discharge.
These vent poles allow air movement to and from the pipeline when the system "swamps" during
storms, empties after storm flow and when pumps start and stop. This avoids either discharge of air
through water seals to private properties creating major health, odour and noise problems or
blowing of street manhole covers creating public safety and operational problems.
During dry weather it will also allow venting of the GID system. This will reduce occupation
health and safety risks, reduce overall system  odour risks and minimise premature asset
deterioration from hydrogen sulphide attack of concrete and fixtures.
4.2.13 Pumping station designs, control features
Pumping station designs are based on the adoption of submersible sewage pumps. These pumps
have been developed in the last 40 years, and are proven and universally adopted worldwide for
wastewater pumping.
Submersible pumps suit a wide variety of operating conditions. In most sewerage systems, pump,
motor and impeller sizes are individually tailored for each pumping station in the system.

Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project                        Additional Works Program
Danang Sub-project (Phase l)                                      Detailed Design Report
Given that these types of pumps have not been previously universally adopted in Vietnam and
considering the standards of available maintenance, in principle a two2 level standardised pump
selection has been adopted. This reduces capital and maintenance costs as well as spare part
inventories and allows maintenance skill requirements to focus on a restricted range of equipment.
It should also minimise the risks of mal-operation resulting from replacement with incorrect spares
or complete units.
Pump capacities are dependent on operating head. The "large" pumps have a nominal design
capacity in the range of 100 to 200 I/s each and the "medium" pumps have a nominal capacity in
the range of 20 to 40 I/s each at a head ranging between 10 and 15 meter. Depending on the
required flow and the resulting head up to a maximum of three duty pumps are required.
Each pump station is equipped with a pedestal mounted switchboard which is located adjacent to a
nearby fence or building wall and which is elevated above flood level if necessary. All other
structures are entirely underground. Pumping stations are located within the public land without
requiring large site acquisition. The visual, social and environmental impact of operating pumping
stations are kept to a minimum.
Pumps are equipped with 3 phase power at permanent station sites. The duty pumps are to start
progressively to limit start power requirements.
Hour run meters are provide at each station, but no flow meters.
The submersible pumps are easily demountable on specially designed guide rails. No specialised
mechanical equipment or expertise is required for pump removal. Pump maintenance and repair is
therefore economically and safely carried out in a specialised central workshop.
Pumping stations are totally sealed and ventilated using a small constantly running fan located in
the switchboard. This fan is of a standard design readily available in Danang. The fan slightly
pressurises the interior of the pumping station to dispel air via the incoming GIDs to vent poles at
the head of each GID. This avoids dangerous build-up of hydrogen sulphide gas within the system
and minimises condensation and corrosion conditions; the contra flow air movement within the
GIDs increases oxygen transfer to the wastewater thereby reducing odour risks.
Each pumping station has several control arrangements:
* Primary pump control
* Secondary overriding pump control
* Tertiary overriding pump control
* PC based operator interface system
Primary pump control - Normal dry weather operation
The primary set of pump level controls is located in the pumping station wet well and control
operations under normal dry weather conditions.
Primary pump start level control:
*  Pump I @ GID Centreline
* Pump 2 @ GIl) Centreline +100mm
2 under contractO 13 a three level standardised pump selection was adopted; however, in the additional works program
there is no need for the smallest size (temporary) pumps

* Pump 3 @ GID Centreline +200mm
In case of multiple GIDs entering the wet well, the centreline of the lowest incoming GID is taken;
this should also be the GID with the largest diameter.
Primary pump stop level control:
* Pump 3 @ Minimum pump submergence +200mm
*  Pump 2 @ Minimum pump submergence +100mm
* Pump 1 @ Minimum pump submergence
The GID centreline to minimum pump submergence is set to give a maximum of 10 starts per
hour.
Controls are set to automatically cycle pump starts to give even wear on all pumps and to avoid
sediment build-up if a standby pump is left idle for any length of time.
Secondary overriding pump control - Wet weather and tidal swamping operation
During wet weather and spring tides, the GID system and the pumping station will all be
"swamped". It is also expected that, during wet weather, flows in stormwater drains will be so
diluted that there will be no net benefit in pumping to the treatment plant for significant part of
times. Therefore during stormwater overflow conditions, pumps can be shut down. This will also
reduce power costs.
To shut down pumps, a secondary "wet weather" pump start level control is located in an adjacent
stormwater diversion structure upstream of the tidal barrier.
This secondary pump start level control is set at the tidal barrier level of (0.6m) +100mm (in
operations this level can be varied to suit likely flow conditions) and overrides the primary pump
start level controls to shut all pumps down. All pumps will be automatically shut down during
significant wet weather flows as well as during major tidal inflows. This will save power and
minimise saltwater contamination of the treatment process.
Timers will first progressively restart all pumps after a pre-set period, and then stop them
progressively after a pre-set period. Variable timer settings will be possible between 15 rninutes
and 24 hours but initial settings of 1/2 hour run and 2 hours stops are set as initial settings.
This frequent restarting with all duty pumps running simultaneously is essential during wet
weather storms to:
*  Minimise accumulation in diversion structures and prevent accumulation of grit in pump
wells. Excessive grit accumulation can block or damage pumps, can block diversion
structures and GIDs, and overload grit removal capabilities at the WWTPs.
*  Keep grit and sludge moving as much as possible and avoid solidification or calcification
which often occurs to sludge held immobile even for relatively short periods and which can
partially or wholly block rising mains and GIDs.
*  Retain sewage from direct connections within the GID/pumping station system, pass it to
the treatment plant and minimise overflow of raw sewage to the environment.
*  Maintain bacterial processes at the treatment plant by maintaining some load - albeit low
pollution loads due to the dilution of wastewater flows with storm flows.
*  Maintain flows at the WWTP outfalls to limit outfall blockage risks by sand movement
along the river bed during floods.
*  Maximise removal of pollutants - particularly from the more highly polluted first flush
flows - which would otherwise go to the environment.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                      Detailed Design Report
For the above reasons it is essential that the pump systems are not shut down during rainy periods
or during the wet season.
When the storm flows subside, the secondary control level is no longer activated (i.e. the water
level in the drain upstream of the tidal barrier has fallen below 0.6m +O.Om). The controls revert to
normal (primary pump control) operation and the duty pumps will run until pump stop control
levels are reached in the wet well.
Tertiary overriding pump control - Wet weather and tidal svamping operation
During wet weather or by tidal inflow it is possible under some conditions that overflow at the
rising main discharge point occurs. This can happen where a rising main discharges into an
adjacent catchment GID which is swamped. Similar conditions might result if an extended power
outage occurs at a downstream pumping station or the downstream pumping station has completely
failed for some other reason.
Therefore at each discharge manhole a tertiary overriding pump level control is provided which
will shut down the pumps in all upstream pumping stations in case the receiving GID is swamped;
the discharge manhole is also provide with an overflow.
The upstream pumping station will change to the same variable timer starting and stopping regime
as is required under the Secondary pump level control system until all the downstream pumping
stations are operating in the Primary pump level control mode. Restarting of the upstream pumping
station pumps in Primary pump level control mode shall be programmed to progressively occur
from the downstream catchment pumping stations lowest to the upstream pumping station in the
system.
PC based operator interface system
As well as normal override controls, at each pumping station a PC based operator interface system
is to be provided. This system - through a remote telemetry connection between each pumping
station and a central PC based operator - allows full remote monitoring, control and recording of
the system operation, such as:
* Each pump's operational status,
e Each pump's current draw;
Pumping station operational mode;
* Pumping station alarm status based on level detectors;
Pumping rate based on wet well volume and level detectors.
The PC based operator interface system for the additional works is to be integrated into the control
system for the ongoing Phase I works. The already implemented PC based operator interface
system is to be reprogrammed to accommodate the controls for the additional works program.
The location of the base station(s) is still under discussion. The recommended location of the base
station for this control system is one at each of the treatment plants. In this way the operator can
control the rising main/pumping system that discharged to the WWTP under its own control. The
result of any control action taken by the operator can immediately be observed at the treatment
plant. This is not possible in case the control system is located in a central office building in
Danang.

These control arrangements, combined with the diversion structures and overflow arrangements,
ensure that first pumping priority is given to sewage from direct connections, second pumping
priority is given to dry weather flows and third pumping priority is given to wet weather
stormwater flows.
4.2.14 Rising mains
Rising mains from pumping stations are similar in design and operation to water mains. However,
they can present major operational and maintenance problems specifically relating to the pumping
of wastewater.
The design must take into carefiul consideration:
*  Minimnising the length of the rising main to reduce detention times and potential for odour
generation. Unlike gravity drains there is no air/water interface within pressure mains and
therefore no opportunity for oxygen transfer to keep the wastewater turning anaerobic and
generating sulphide. Minimising the length also reduces friction head and therefore pump
size and operating costs.
*  Minirnising the diameter again to minimise detention times, but also to improve the self
cleansing ability and the slime shearing ability of the pipe. Wall slimes are a major source
of dangerous and odour producing gases and should therefore be minimised. A smaller
diameter, however, does increase frictional head and thus pump size and operating costs.
*  Pumping to adjacent GIDs in adjacent catchments resulting in higher capacity flows in
those GIDs. This allows larger diameter drains with flatter self cleansing grades to be
installed. This reduces the number of pumping stations required and allows more aeration
of flows to occur reducing potential for odour generation.
*  Avoiding odour gcneration by making arrangements to avoid drops and to minimise
turbulence by controlled grades.
High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) is adopted as pipe material because of its operational
advantages including reduced power consumption, breakage risks and odour generation potential.
This is achieved through the materials:
* High corrosion and abrasion resistance.
* Smooth bore and low joints requirement reducing the blockage risks and slime build-up,
and increasing velocities (i.e. higher self cleansing ability).
* Continuity of pipeline eliminating the need for thrust blocks.
* Flexibility i.e. ability to lay around curves and to withstand deformation without loosing
operating integrity.
* Ability to colour the pipe material for easy identification purposes thus reducing risks of
mistaken tapping of the main as a water main.

5 WASTEWATER COLLECTION - DETAILED DESIGNS
5.1 Introduction
The following section discusses for each wastewater catchment area in the additional works
program the final designs for the wastewater collection systems. Since most works either have an
impact on or are impacted by the ongoing Phase 1 works, necessitating a change from the
feasibility study, the existing designs and their integration with the additional works are discussed
first. Subsequently the design flows, chosen diameters and alignment of pipes are discussed.
5.2 Hoa Cuong catchment
5.2.1 Existing design
All wastewater of catchment II, III, IV and VII along the shore of the Han River will be treated at
Hoa Cuong WWTP. The WWTP is located in the southwest of Hoa Cuong ward.
In the original design, wastewater from catchments II and III is collected by GID and pumped by
SPS12, SPS13 and SPS14 on Bach Dang - 2/9 Street to the WWTP. Wastewater from the two
main drains of catchment IV is intercepted at SPS 14 and directly pumped to the WWTP.
The southern stretch of 2/9 Street - from Duy Tan Street to T-crossing with Nui Thanh Street is
not included.
5.2.2 Description of additional area and integration with existing design/options
An entertainment centre is being developed on the east side of 2/9 road comprising the Danang
water park - which is in operation - and a sport centre and park area - which are being finalized.
In addition, a considerable volume of wastewater generated along Nui Thanh and 2/9 Streets is
being discharged directly to this area causing serious pollution.
In the additional works programme it is therefore proposed to construct GIDs along the south end
of 2/9 Street and pump the collected wastewater to the Hoa Cuong treatment plant.
As mentioned above, in the original Phase I plans wastewater construction works (GIDs) in 2/9
street end approximately at the Duy Tan Street. From there, wastewater is to be pumped by a long
rising main to the Hoa Cuong WWTP. In the designs only one rising main (630 mm) is foreseen.
However, due to the length of the rising main, the static head and the amount of waste water to be
pumped, two rising mains (630 mm) as well as two large pumping stations would be required.
The feasibility study for the additional works program proposed a small GID (#15) to be
constructed along the south-end of 2/9 street; and a new SPS (#15) to pump the wastewater
through a rising main (RM15) to Hoa Cuong WWTP (see Figure 5-1).
For 2/9 Street it is more efficient and cost effective to continue the GID being constructed north of
Duy Tan Street in southward direction, all the way to Tuyen Son Bridge as part of the ongoing
Phase I works.

receives from upstream GIDs and/or pumping stations.
The system along the south end of 2/9 street is divided into a continuation of GID 14 from north of
Duy Tan Street for about 450m until the 29/3 Square and GID 15 from the 29/3 Square until the T-

At each outfall along the road the GID will intercept the wastewater coming fom the main- and

just as GID15.

A large pumping station (SPS 14) with 3 duty pumps (1 standby) transfers the wastewater through a
502m long rising main (630mm) to the starting point of GID15 at the south end of 29/3 Square.
The combination of pump characteristics and rising main characteristics results in a maximum
pump capacity of 545 I/s.
Another large pumping station (SPS15) with 3 duty pumps (1 standby) transfers the wastewater
through a 710m long rising main (630mm) to the Hoa Cuong treatment plant.
The combination of pump characteristics and rising main characteristics results in a maximum
pump capacity of 582 I/s.
5.2.4 Alignment, SPS locations and longitudinal profile
The alignment of the GID is on the eastern side of 2/9 Street. However, a 900mm water main
already runs under that side of the pavement right next to the carriageway. The trench for the GID
should be far enough away from this water main so as not to disturb its bedding. Next to the
pavement, which is 5m wide, runs a patch of grass 6m wide. The alignment of the GD is therefore
right on the border between the pavement and the patch of grass.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                       Detailed Design Report
The alignment of the rising main from SPS 14 to the start of GID 15 is along the eastern side of the
2/9 Street, in the pavement. The rising main from SPS15 to the Hoa Cuong runs straight west
along the pavement to the south side of the new road coming from the Tuyen Son Bridge.
5.2.5 Special issues
The alignment of the rising main from SPS15 to Hoa Cuong treatment plant is along a newly
planned road running east-west from 2/9 Street. Presently this road has not been built yet. At the
moment of construction of the rising main, there is a possibility that the road is still not built.
An alternative route for the rising main is along an alley between 2/9 Street and Nui Thanh Street,
continuing on the other side of Nui Thanh Street along the access way to a factory and between a
couple of houses.
Drawback of this alternative is that the length of pipe required is larger and that the pipeline
crosses private property.
Rising main 15 has to cross Nui Thanh Street which lies considerably higher than 2/9 Street.
Because of the sharp vertical bend, an air-valve is required here to release trapped air that could
block the flow of water.
Near the treatment plant, the rising main crosses an open drainage channel. This crossing is
achieved with a steel casing pipe. However, the open drain might in the near future be replaced by
a large concrete box drain. Crossing straight through the box drain is undesirable since it would
involve a major reconstruction (and widening) of the drain. It is recommended to cross under the
drain and continue at the same depth to the discharge point at the nearby WWTP. In that case also
here an air-valve is required because of the sharp vertical bend.
Since there is a high point in the rising main around Nui Thanh Street, a scour valve is required at
each end of the pipeline in order to be able to empty the entire conduit. The scour valve at the
treatment plant discharges to the wet well of the treatment plant pumping station . The scour valve
at 2/9 Street discharges to the wet well, which has an overflow to a nearby roadside drain.
5.3 Son Tra catchment
5.3.1 Existing design
Under the ongoing works of Phase 1 the wastewater of part of An Hai Bac ward is collected along
the Han River embankment north of the Han River Bridge by a series of GIDs and pumped to the
Son Tra treatment plant in the north.
Also the wastewater from the fishing village on the eastern seaboard in Man Thai ward is to be
collected and pumped to the Son Tra treatment plant. This latter system, however, consists of a
number of (temporary) pumping stations at existing outlets to the sea and small bore rising mains.
The reason for not using gravity interceptors is that the construction of GIDs to serve these areas
would have  involved major community disruption. Resettlement of around 150 houses per
kilometre of GID would have been unavoidable due to the construction width necessary.
Construction along the beach would substantially reduce resettlement but not enough; it would also
add to the cost and require additional pumping stations due to the difficulties and risks of
construction along the water front.
The above situation along the fishing village of Man Thai ward has changed since the time of the
original design. At the moment a coastal road is being constructed along the eastern seaboard.

Vietnam Three Cities Sanitation Project                         Additional Works Program
Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                       Detailed Design Report
Construction has started several kilometres north of the village. Within a year the road is expected
to pass the village. This creates better possibilities for a GID system since a wide area is being
cleared along the beach for this road.
For that reason the system has been redesigned and integrated with the additional works program.
5.3.2 Description of additional area and integration with existing design/options
With the finalization of the Pham Van Dong Street (between the Son Hang Bridge and the beach),
it is expected that new residential areas will quickly develop along this road. A much larger
volume of wastewater than present will be discharged to sea if no counter measures are taken. In
addition, a large drain originating from the industries along Ngo Quyen Street flows into the sea
600m to the north of Pham Van Dong Street.
In the additional works program a wastewater collection system will intercept the wastewater
between Pham Van Dong Street and the fishing village covered in the Phase I works.
This will greatly reduce the levels of pollution along this part of the Son Tra beach area.
Since the system along the fishing village is redesigned it makes great sense (both from a technical
as well as a financial point of view) to make an integrated design for the wastewater collection
system along the Son Tra coast line. In that case the total investment cost for the Son Tra coastal
area would be reduced by almost 15% (see Appendix C.2).
In the integrated design a GID starts from Pham Van Dong Street northward (GID2) and another
from an existing outfall southward (GID2A) As at,present, not much wastewater is expected form
the area around Pham Van Dong Street, the first section of GID 2 will not be installed, at present.
Pumping station (SPS2) pumps the intercepted wastewater from GID2 and GID2A to GIDI. This
GID continues northward along the fishing village until SPS1. From the North side, the system
starts with a small pumping station that pumps intercepted wastewater from another fishing village
towards GID 1 A. GID 1 A transports the pumped wastewater towards SPS 1, while collecting further
wastewater along the way. Finally the wastewater is pumped by SPS 1 to the Son Tra treatment
plant.
5.3.3 Design flows
The dimensions of the GIDs is based on the size of the flow it intercepts from drains it crosses
(usually at outfalls or road crossings) plus the size of the flow it receives from upstream GIDs
and/or pumping stations.
The system along the Son Tra coastline is divided into 2 sections of GIDs and pumping stations:
The first section includes 573m of GID2 from Pham Van Dong Street that will be constructed in
the future, followed by 200m that will be constructed as part of the additional works. GID2A is
about 560 m long. The second section includes GIDI (776m) and GIDla (220m).
Table 5-2 shows for each section the length from one node to another, the catchment area that
drains to the section from side streets, the upstream inflow, the total flow upon which the size of
the drain is based and finally the diameter of that section of GID (or rising main).

A medium size pumping station (SPS2) with 2 duty pumps (1 standby) transfers the wastewater
through a 877m long rising main (315mm) to the starting point of GID1. The combination of
pump characteristics and rising main characteristics results in a maximum pump capacity of
120 V/s.
A small size pumping station (TPS1.01) with 1 duty pump (1 standby) transfers the wastewater
through a 407m long rising main (160mm) to GID1A.
The combination of pump characteristics and rising main characteristics results in a maximum
pump capacity of 10 I/s.
Finally a medium-large size pumping station (SPS1) with 2 duty pumps (1 standby) transfers the
wastewater through a 1290m long rising main (400mm) to the Son Tra treatment plant.
The combination of pump characteristics and rising main characteristics results in a maximum
pump capacity of 146 1/s.
5.3.4 Alignment, SPS locations and longitudinal profile
The alignment of the GIDs is on the eastern side of the new coastal road, in the pavement.
Of the three pumping stations, the first (SPS2) is located almost 800 m north of Pham Van Dong
Street; TPS1.01 is located on the south bank of a stream/open drain at the south end of the fishing
village; the third pumping station (SPSI) located at the end of a small unpaved road between the
houses of the fishing village leading towards Phan Ba Phien Street. The road is just wide enough
to install the 400 mm RM1 that, via Phan Ba Phien Street and after crossing Ngo Quyen road,
ultimately goes to the Son Tra WWTP.
The alignment of the rising main from SPS2 to the start of GIDI is along the new coastal road, in
the pavement, as is the alignment of the rising main from TPS 1.01 to the start of GID I A.
The rising main from SPS 1 to the Son Tra treatment plant first runs west towards Ngo Quyen road.
It runs parallel to this road and then turns west towards the treatment plant.

5.3.5 Special issues
In Son Tra wastewater catchment area, part of GIDI, SPSI, RM1 and TPS 1.01 are part of
Contract 013 of the ongoing Phase I works; GID2, SPS2 and RM2 are part of the additional works
program.
GID1, SPSI and RM1 have been redesigned in such a way that they can accommodate the future
flows from the additional areas to the south.
Originally a number (4) of temporary wastewater pumps and a small SPS along the fishing village
of Man Thai were foreseen. A small bore rising main was to pump the limited wastewater amounts
to Son Tra WWTP.
In the redesign, a GID is foreseen along the new coastal road. The pumping station SPSI is
enlarged as well as the diameter of the rising main. The alignment of the rising main, however,
remains almost unaltered.
5.4 Ngu Hanh Son catchment
5.4.1 Original designs and changes foreseen
The original design for the Ngu Hanh Son wastewater catchment area of the ongoing Phase I
works envisioned GIDs along My Khe Beach (in the south of Phuoc My ward) and Bac Me An
Beach covering roughly the area between the My Khe Beach Hotel and the Furama Resort (or
between Nguyen Cong Tru and Ho Xuan Huong roads).
However, part of Phuoc My ward and An Hai Tay ward drain towards a low lying area inland from
the My Khe Beach Hotel; due to its elevation, this area cannot discharge its water by gravity
towards the beach. To protect the ponds formed in the low lying area from wastewater discharge, a
number of additional temporary pumping stations were to pump the water to the GIDs located
along the beach.
From the GIDs, pumping stations were to transport the wastewater to the Ngu Hanh Son treatment
plant.
Due to the delays in project implementation and the rapid development of the area the wastewater
collection system has been reconsidered.
In the additional works program a large stormwater drain is constructed along the low lying areas
in the south of Phuoc My ward to the middle of Bac My An ward (see paragraph 3.5). All
wastewater and stormwater run-off from the area south of Nguyen Cong Tru Street and east of
Ngu Hanh Son Street will flow to this drain. The area presently has two outfalls: one south of My
Khe Beach Hotel, one south of Furama Resort; both discharging wastewater as well as stormwater
run-off. Under the additional works program the outfall south of My Khe Beach Hotel is upgraded
and another outfall is added between the two existing outfalls, north of St. Paulo Monastery. The
upgraded outfall south of My Khe Beach Hotel and the new outfall north of St. Paulo Monastery
are utilised to discharge storm water from the new drain; in a later stage the drain will be extended
south towards the Furama Resort, and the Furama outfall will be upgraded.

Danang Sub-project (Phase 1)                                       Detailed Design Report
Since there are only three points at which water is discharged to the sea and these points lie too far
apart (1400m) to connect by one gravity pipe, the wastewater will be intercepted at these three
points and directly pumped away.
5.4.2 Description of additional area and integration with existing design/options
River
Presently the area between the Tran Thi Ly Bridge and the Tuyen Son Bridge is being back filled
and will be developed into a residential area similarly to the areas to the north along the river. The
drainage system of the area will discharge towards the Han River.
In order to protect the river environment a GID along the embankment will intercept the untreated
wastewater and transport it to pumping stations which in turn pumps it to the Ngu Hanh Son
treatment plant.
The length of road along the river between the two bridges is around 1.5km. This length is too long
to cover by one GID without intermediate pumping station; the excavation depth would otherwise
be too deep. Therefore this section of GID has two pumping stations: one relatively small one to
lift the wastewater to the nearby continuing GID and one to pump the wastewater to the Ngu Hanh
Son treatment plant.
Beach
As mentioned in paragraph 5.4.1, the wastewater from the area east of Ngu Hanh Son Street is to
be intercepted at the three outfalls along the beach.
Since the distance between the outfalls is too large to bridge with one GID without intermediate
pumping stations, the intercepted wastewater is therefore pumped directly from the outfalls.
Since it does not make sense to pump the water from  {                    :c D .

constructed Ngu Hanh Son Street. Since the difference in cost between options 2 and 3 is very
small, Option 2 is chosen.
5.4.3 Design flows
The dimensions of the GIDs is based on the size of the flow it intercepts from drains it crosses
(usually at road crossings) plus the size of the flow it receives from upstream GIDs and/or
pumping stations.
The wastewater collection system in the Ngu Hanh Son catchment is divided into a western section
along the river and an eastern section along the beach.
River
The section along the Han River - consisting of 2 lengths of GIDs and 2 pumping stations -
collects the wastewater from the area between Ngu Hanh Son Street and the river.
Beach
The eastern section of the catchment only has three outfalls to the sea at which points the
wastewater is intercepted.
Table 5-3 shows for each section the length from one node to another, the catchment area that
drains to the section from side streets, the upstream inflow, the total flow upon which the size of
the drain(or rising main) is based and finally the diameter of that section of GID (or rising main).

5.4.4 Alignment, SPS locations and longitudinal profile
River
The alignment of the GIDs along the river is on the western side of the new embankment road, in
the pavement.
The two pumping stations in the western catchment of Ngu Hanh Son are located in such a way
that excavations do not become deeper than necessary, whereby it was ensured that the larger
diameter upstream GID would be slightly deeper than the smaller drain. The operation of the
pumping station will thus be based on the larger GID with the larger flow.
The pumping stations of the eastern catchment of Ngu Hanh Son are located directly next to each
of the sea outfalls, where the wastewater is intercepted from the combined drain.
The alignment of the rising main from SPS5 to the start of GID33 is along the river on the western
side of the new embankment road, in the pavement. The rising main from SPS33 to SPS35 first
runs parallel to the Han River, towards the Tuyen Son bridge, then crosses the new road, makes a
bend and then goes east up towards Ngu Hanh Son Street, towards SPS35.
Beach
The rising main from SPS3 follows the alignment of a new beach road, to be constructed in the
near future, and leads directly to SPS4.
An alternative option would be to lay the rising main from SPS3 in a westward direction, parallel
to the My Khe outfall drain and then - at the drain's T-junction - turn it south for about 630m until
the (northern) upstream start of the Bac My An section of the drain. There, the wastewater would
then be injected again into the drain and would flow under gravity towards the Bac My An outfall
where it would be intercepted again. The drain and rising main could be constructed at the same
time, in the same trench and would not result in additional land requirements.
It is considered best to keep wastewater, once it is already intercepted, inside the wastewater
collection system and not relate it again to a large combined drain. However, if at some stage,
construction along the road meets technical or political obstacles, it could be decided to select the
altemative option described here. However, it would require a revision of the interceptor at the Bac
My An outfall which would have to cope with larger wastewater flows.
Similar to RM3, the rising main from SPS4 towards SPS34 follows the alignment of the new beach
road until it reaches SPS 34. An alternative option as described above for RM3, with injection of
intercepted wastewater back into the next section of the drain, would also be possible here.
However, it is as yet uncertain if the complete drain will be built. A section requiring much
resettlement may well be dropped (without seriously hampering the overall functioning of the My
Khe drain), which would complicate the alternative option.
The rising main from SPS34 runs straight west from the beach to Le Van Hien Street. The
alignment follows as much as possible the planned road alignment.
Since the Hu Xuan Huong Street has been recently reconstructed by the time the rising main is
built, it is not recommended to follow that street; going through Hu Xuan Huong Street would also
result in a longer pipeline.
The location where RM33 and RM34 come together - at SPS35 - lies approx. 60m south of the Hu
Xuan Huong/Ngu Hanh Son Street intersection.

The rising main from SPS35 to the Ngu Hanh Son treatment plant follows the Eastern side of Le
Van Hien Street south until the turn-off and then uphill towards the treatment plant. The last 300m
the area slopes down towards the treatment plant. Near the high point, the rising main discharges
into a manhole from where the wastewater flows towards the treatment plant by gravity.
5.4.5 Special issues
As mentioned in paragraph 5.4.1, originally GlDs were foreseen for the beach area of the Ngu
Hanh Son wastewater catchment area. These GIDs have been removed from the Contract 013
ongoing Phase I works and the design and construction for the wastewater collection of the area
added to Additional Works package 020.
Wastewater is intercepted at each of the three outfalls: the reconstructed My Khe Beach Outfall,
the new St. Paulo Monastery Outfall, and the existing Furama Outfall.
At the outfalls, the shape of the drain is such (V-form of the middle drain) that a relatively small
interceptor at the end of the rmiddle of the three channels of the drain suffices.

6 PROCUREMENT PLAN FOR ADDITIONAL WORKS
6.1 Introduction
The procurement plan for the Additional Works is complicated and simple at the same time. It is
complicated as a large number of Additional Works project components are shifted to ongoing
contracts through addendum or variation orders, while parts of the Phase I defined project will be
shifted to a new civil works package, 020.
The additional works consist of:
1. Drainage
2. Wastewater collection systems
3. Floating covers for Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son wastewater treatment plants
4. Beach Cleaning Equipment
5. Detailed Engineering
Details on procurement for each of these components are presented below.
6.2 Details on procurement proposals
6.2.1 Drainage
Except for the Dinh Tham drain, all Additional Works drains are considerably larger than those
constructed under the ongoing Phase 1 works and they are not connected to any of the drains in the
present program. Moreover, there have been several large variation orders already to contract 013
and there is no strong reason to include drainage works in the ongoing contract 013.
However, there is a strong desire to construct the Le Do drain as early as possible. Most of the
drain will be constructed under an existing road, while upon completion of the drain, the road will
be extended immediately and connected to the new Lien Chieu road along the Danang Bay.
A request was made by the Danang People's Committee to include the Le Do drain in the ongoing
.3
contract 013, as then an early start could be made with the drain construction3.
It is proposed, therefore, to include all drains (except Le Do drain) into a new package (020) and
construct Le Do drain under a variation order to ongoing contract 013.
6.2.2 Additional Wastewater collection systems
The Additional Works contain additions to the wastewater collection systems of Hoa Cuong, Son
Tra and Ngu Hanh Son.
The additions to the Hoa Cuong system are very minimal and the new design has integrated the
additions with the original system. The logical way to construct it is through a (minimal) variation
to the ongoing contract 013.
Similarly, most of the Son Tra wastewater system remains unchanged. Only along the East coast of
the catchment area, a system with temporary pumping stations is replaced by a (slightly) more
elaborate wastewater collection system along the new coastal road, presently under construction.
Also here, a variation to ongoing contract 013 is the best.
The Ngu Hanh Son wastewater collection system has changed completely. The changes are caused
by the new My Khe drain, with three sea outfalls, that will be constructed under future package
3The World Bank has agreed with the request, provided the RAP will be approved first.

020. The wastewater collection system must be constructed together with the new drains. In case
something changes (which occurs frequently), the wastewater system can be adjusted at the same
time. Constructing the Ngu Hanh Son wastewater system now, as a variation to contract 013, does
not make sense. It would result in a completed wastewater system, while most of the related
drainage infrastructure would not be in place.
It is proposed, therefore, to remove the complete Ngu Hanh Son wastewater system from contract
013 and procure the new design of the wastewater system, including the additions, under package
020. This proposal also compensates to a large extent the extra costs to contract 013 for the
construction of the Le Do drain (see Section 6.2.1).
6.2.3 Floating covers for the Son Tra and Ngu Hanh Son wastewater treatment plants
The costs of HDPE floating covers for the two smaller treatment plants at Son Tra and Ngu Hanh
Son (that are presently constructed under contract 012) are quite substantial. As contract 012
already faces cost overruns, ideally, procurement of floating covers would be made under package
020 (or a separate small package). However, for reasons presented below, it is proposed to procure
the two floating covers under a variation to ongoing contract 012.
Floating covers must be made while the treatment lagoons are empty. Although it is not impossible
to construct the covers over lagoons filled with wastewater, it is difficult, the quality often suffers
and it adds to their costs. Therefore, it is much preferred to construct floating covers at the same
time as the treatment plants, when lagoons are still empty.
Keeping the lagoons at Son Tra empty until a floating cover is installed under future package 020
would delay the start of operations of the otherwise completed Son Tra wastewater system.
Another aspect to consider is that the (minimally reinforced) concrete lining of the lagoons may
suffer if the lagoons are kept empty and under the blazing sun for prolonged periods of time.
Adding the floating cover under a variation to 012 is proposed, therefore.
A later start of operations does not matter for the Ngu Hanh Son treatment plant, which will only
become operational after the construction of the My Khe drain and the Ngu Hanh Son wastewater
system, both proposed for procurement under future package 020.
Nevertheless, when already 3 out of 4 covers will be procured under contract 012 it seems odd to
move the last cover for the small Ngu Hanh Son plant to package 020.
6.2.4 Beach Cleaning Equipment
Two self-propelled beach cleaners were procured already under a small (national Shopping)
contract 016. Delivery of the equipment took place in April 2003.
6.2.5 Detailed Engineering
Detailed Engineering was procured under an Addendum to ongoing contract 011 (for Construction
Management Services). The addendum was signed in January 2003 and includes detailed
engineering and preparation of Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA), Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and Tender Documents for package
020.

Based on the above considerations, the resulting procurement proposal is presented in the table

8 RESETTLEMENT
8.1 Introduction
The drainage component of the project will cause some adverse impacts on peoples' assets. The
wastewater works and beach cleaning components will not result in adverse impacts on peoples'
assets nor will they cause any loss of businesses or incomes. A resettlement Action Plan (RAP)
was prepared that covers: a) project components and impacts; b) compensation entitlement policy;
c) costs and budgets; and d) implementation arrangements. Details are presented in Volume 2:
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). A summary of the findings is presented in this chapter.
For the RAP preparation census, inventory and socio-economic surveys were conducted covering
143 PAPs. The socio-economic characteristics of the PAPs indicate that:
* Average household size of the PAPs in the four sub-project areas is 5.8.
* Most of the households are either salaried persons working in government departments
(42.1%) or in business and commerce (3 7.8%). A small number of households also earn
their living by fishing (9.8%) or through agricultural activities (9.8%).
* Majority (50.3%) of the surveyed households have an average monthly household income
ranging between one to 2 million VND. The percentage of those earning below one million
VND is 32.2%. 25 households or 17.5%, have an average monthly household income of
more than 2 million VND. Most of these come from the Le Do area.
8.2 Impacts of the Project
The Additional Works Project will affect a total of 187 PAPs. Except for the Le Do area, other
components will result in only marginal impacts on the PAPs. In Le Do the major impact is due to
the proposed road and a 23 m (20 m for plots and 3 m for a lane) wide adjoining areas on both
sides of the road designated for redevelopment. The urban redevelopment of the area, including the
road, will affect a total of 102 households, 90 of them severely.
8.2.1 Loss of Agricultural Land
The project will impact a total of 40 PAPs due to the loss of agricultural land. Most of these PAPs
(32 Households) are in the An Khe area. Only four of the 32 PAPs affected in An Khe area own
the affected land. The remaining 28 PAPs have the affected land on lease from the commune.
Total land that will need to be acquired totals 588 m2. Additionally, 2,526 m2 of commune land
that is on lease will need to be repossessed for the project.
8.2.2 Loss of Residential Land
A total of 134 PAPs would be affected due to the loss of 11,978.5 m2 of residential land of which
102 PAPs (10,364.5 m2) are affected due to the urban redevelopment project in Le Do area. Of
these 90 PAPs would be affected due to the loss of their entire land holdings (8,428.7 m2) while 12
PAPs will be affected due to the partial loss of residential land. In Le Dinh Tham, 13 PAPs (69.5
m2) will be affected by partial loss of residential land. The corresponding number in My Khe is 19
PAPs with 1,544.5 m2.

8.2.3 Impacts on Structures
The project will impact a total of 110 PAPs due to the loss of structures. The total area of the
affected structures is 7,312.9 m2, taking into account all the floors. Majority of the affected
structures are category 3 and 4.
8.2.4 Loss of other Fixed Assets
A total of 75 PAPs, most of them in the Le Do area, will be affected by the loss of boundary walls.
29 PAPs will be affected by the loss of fences. Additionally, the loss of paved yards will impact a
total of 78 PAPs, again most of them in the Le Do area. 4 PAPs in An Khe area would be affected
by the loss of fish-ponds (214 m2) and would be entitled to compensation for the same.
A total of 24 PAPs would be affected due to the loss of trees, most of them in the Le Do area.
8.2.5 Loss of Incomes and Businesses
A total of 43 PAPs would be affected due to the loss of incomes from cultivation of agricultural
land. Additionally, a total of 12 PAPs will be affected by loss of business incomes. All these
businesses are managed from affected houses. Only 6 of the affected businesses will be displaced
by the project.
8.2.6 Impacts on Public Infrastructure and Utilities
The proposed drainage and associated road development will cause extensive impact on existing
public utilities such as: electric poles, power distribution lines, road side pavements, existing
drains etc. In accordance with the policy, all impacted public facilities and utilities will be made
good and the DNPC will ensure repairs and rehabilitation of all affected infrastructure.
8.3 Temporary Impacts
Construction works implementation of extended project will have temporary impacts on a large
number of road side businesses, houses and other establishments. The impacts would be mainly the
restricted access and inconvenience during the project implementation. There may some minor
impacts on the boundary walls, fences and other fixed assets during the construction phase.
8.4 Relocation Requirements
Out of the 187 PAPs affected by the project, only 90 PAPs will be displaced requiring relocation.
All these PAPs are affected by the proposed road and redevelopment of Le Do area. In addition to
the 90 PAPs requiring relocation, another 12 PAPs would be marginally affected due to the loss of
residential land, houses and other fixed assets, trees, businesses and incomes.
The Da Nang Peoples' Committee (DNPC) proposes to develop the vacated area and provide plots
of regular size (4.5x20m) and sell them to people, with priority given to the PAPs. The selling
price is tentatively fixed at VND 3.0 million/m2 whereas the current compensation rate for
residential land in the area varies between 0.5 for land behind the main road, to VND 3.6
million/m2 for plots facing he main road. Further, after the redevelopment only a maximum of 68
plots can be planned in the area. Therefore, the remaining 22 PAPs are to be relocated at a newly
developed area in Thanh Loc Dan. At Thanh Loc Dan the selling price of the plots of similar size
is between VND 1.0-1.5 million per m2.

Danang Sub-project (Phase I)                                      Detailed Design Report
Since the developed plots at Le Do and Thanh Loc Dan area are to be sold to people, the PAPs
have the choice to either buy the developed plots from DNPC from the compensation entitlements
or settle themselves anywhere at their choice of location.
The Entitlement Matrix summarizing the entitlements for each category of PAPs is included in the
RAP.
8.5 Resettlement Cost
The resettlement cost for the project will be part of the project cost. They will be covered out of
the funds provided by DNPC and a necessary budget has been allocated for the purpose. The
resettlement cost of the Additional Works Project, estimated using the compensation rates and
allowances established by the DNPC, amount to VND 14,444 million. This includes contingencies
of 10%, external monitoring cost of VND 150 million, and administration cost of VND 550
million. In the case of any over-runs, URENCO will be responsible to provide any additional funds
as necessary to ensure that resettlement implementation is carried out in a timely manner.

9 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS
9.1 Introduction
An assessment of the Additional Works Project's potential environmental impacts was conducted
for Pre-construction, Construction, and Operation phases. The assessment evaluated a range of
potential impacts that could occur as a result of the Additional Works Project. Alternative options
of project design were considered to minimize negative impacts of the project. Details are
presented in Volume 3: Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).
Mitigation of negative impacts are described in great detail and are mostly based on experiences
from  the ongoing sanitation project.  Details are presented in Volume 4: Environmental
Management Plan (EMP). A summary of the findings of the environmental studies is presented in
this chapter.
9.2 Alternatives
Numerous alternatives are being considered within the Additional Works Project. However, the
practical scope of options are limited, as the project needs to integrate with Phase I works - both in
location and operational design. The "No Project" alternative would likely mean that:
1. flooding in the Additional Works Project area will continue which would continue to
impact public health, economic development, and transport,
2. wastewater will continue to drain into nearby rivers and beaches, which will negatively
affect public health and tourism; and
3. solid waste will continue to be dumped on popular beaches, which will negatively affect
public health and tourism.
9.3 Impacts
An assessment of the Additional Works Project's potential environmental impacts was conducted
for Pre-construction, Construction, and Operation phases. The assessment evaluated a range of
potential impacts that could occur as a result of the Additional Works Project. The selection of
potential impacts for evaluation was based on site visits, discussions with Phase I project staff,
URENCO, DoSTE and others; and through review of relevant documents such as World Bank's
Environmental Assessment Sourcebook, Phase I environmental assessment reports, the Additional
Works Project's Feasibility Study and others. The below provides a summary impact evaluation of
potential impacts that could be created by the Additional Works Project.

9.4 Environmental Management Plan
An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been produced for this Additional Works Project.
(Volume 4 of the detailed engineering study reports).
The EMP: 1) identifies potential adverse impacts and suggests measures to mitigate adverse
impacts; 2) suggests programmes to monitor both the effectiveness of the mitigation measures; and
the numerous positive impacts created by Additional Works Project; and 3) provides guidance on
the institutional responsibilities for Pre-Construction, Construction, and Operation Phases.
9.5 Conclusion
This project's purpose is to mitigate priority urban environmental issues - namely, sewage and
sanitation services in areas that could not be supported by the Phase I project. The construction of
these services will create some short-term negative impacts. However, the Additional Works
Project's long-term positive impacts during operation outweigh its negative impacts by far.

C.1    Cost comparison 2/9 Street
A comparison has been made for the wastewater collection system of 2/9 Street between the
investment cost of the original design - where the proposed system is separate and independent of
the ongoing Phase I works - and an alternative - where the proposed system is integrated into the
ongoing Phase 1 works.
Table C. 1 shows the cost of the original design, where small diameter GIDs (14A, 15 and 15A)
collect wastewater along 2/9 Street south of Tran Thi Ly bridge. Two large pumping stations
(SPS14) and two long rising mains pump the wastewater collected from the area north of Duy Tan
Street/Tran Thi Ly Bridge to Hoa Cuong treatment plant. A small pumping station (SPS 15) pumps
the wastewater collected along the south end of 2/9 street to the Hoa Cuong treatment plant.

Table C.1 Cost estimate of original design for wastewater system 2/9 street
Table C.2 shows the cost of the integrated design, where the GID coming from the north of Duy
Tan Street/Tran Thi Ly bridge is continued for another 558m to the south of Duy Tan Street/Tran
Thi Ly bridge; from here the wastewater is pumped (SPS 14) to a large diameter GID further down
the road. This GID is continued till the end of 2/9 Street from where a large pumping station
(SPS 15) pumps the wastewater to the Hoa Cuong treatment plant.

Table C.2 Cost estimate of integrated design for wastewater system 2/9 street
The unit rates used in the cost estimate were derived from the cost items submitted by the
contractor for the ongoing Phase 1 works. They were "normalized" to compensate inconsistencies
in the bid prices, like higher costs for smaller pipes.

C.2    Cost comparison Son Tra Beach area
A comparison has been made for the wastewater collection system of the Son Tra beach area
between the investment cost of the original design - where the proposed system is separate and
independent of the ongoing Phase I works - and an alternative - where the proposed system is
integrated with the ongoing Phase I works.
Table C.3 shows the cost of the original design, where the redesigned Phase I wastewater
construction works include a GID (#1) along the beach at the north-east side of Son Tra. Collected
wastewater is to be pumped (by SPSU/RM1) to WWTP Son Tra. The additional works program
includes a GID (#2) to the south side of GID1. Collected wastewater is to be pumped over great
distance (by SPSl/RM1) to WWTP Son Tra.
