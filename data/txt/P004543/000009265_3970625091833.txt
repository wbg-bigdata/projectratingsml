REFORM PROGRAM FOR GOVERNMENT CORrORATIONS
Loan and Prolect Summary
Borrower:            Republic of the Philippines
Amount:              US$200 million equivalent
Terms:               20 years, including 5 years grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Program Descrigtion:   The proposed reform program constitutes the
foundation stage for phased structural adjustment of the public
corporato sector in the Philippines.   It focuses on the Non-
Financial Government Corporations (NFGCs), while the
rehabilitation of the Government Financial Institutions (CFIs) is
being addressed through a parallel operation, namely the Economic
Recovery Loan (ERL) approved by the Board on March 17, 1987. The
proposed program, already ongoing, establishes a policy and
institutional framework to reduce, limit and rationalize
government activities using the corporate form, and institutes
improvements in the efficiency and effectiveniess of retained
NFGCs and GFIs (collectively referred to as Government
Corporations or GCs) in order to gradually reduce the heavy
burden they impose on the economy. Its key elements are:
(a) establishment of a policy framework which enunciates ground
rules for the establishment and operation of GCs;
(b) a rationalization program to correct anomalies in the
existing public sector corporate portfolio and ensure an
appropriate  disposition  of  all  GCs;  this  includes
privatization, consolidation, conversion to private nonprofit
status, transfer to departments or abolition of GCs; and
(c) an institutional framework for improved operations and
monitoring   of the corporations  remaining in the public
sector; this includes clarification of the roles of
Government entities dealing with GCs, improvement of their
supervision and control, establishing of corporate planning
and performance evaluation systems, and improving the
accounting and auditing of GCs. Measures to improve the
performance of the retained GCs will initially be implemented
15 of the largest NFGCs.
Benefits: In the short term, the project would lead to reduction of
Government grants and contributions as a result of reduced
Government involvement in the corporate sector.   In the longer
term, the policy and institutional changes affecting the
operations of retained GCs, combined with the implementation of
corporate planning and performance evaluation systems will result
in improved investment allocation, greater efficiency and

- ii -
effectiveness of operation, enhancement of the level of services
and improved cost recovery. Public share issues resulting from
the privatization of some GCs will also contribute to the
development of the domestic capital markets.
Risks:   The proposed reform program introduces significant changes in
the composition, organization, coordination, financing and
management of GCs.   Such changes are likely to be met with
resistance from groups and individuals benefiting from the .status
quo.  The privatization and reorganization of GCs would affect
the labor force, thus initially creating adverse reactions. Such
internal pressures could slow implementation and/or reduce the
effectiveness of some parts of the program.   To addro';s these
problems, and mitigate their possible adverse impact, the
Government is educating the public on the need for the reforms,
is planning for a phased implementation, and has introduced other
compensatory measures such as early retirement packages and
special severance payments. Although the main legal framework for
the sector is already in place, some legislative action is still
required, the approval of which may delay setting in place the
completed framework envisioned by the Government. The above
mentioned risks are also mitigated by the country consensus on
the need to reform the government corporate sector, and the fact
that some of the most difficult steps (the approval of the main
legal framework, the establishment and staffing of the required
mechanisms, the required studies and rationalization, the
decisions on the disposition of the government corporations,
etc.) have been achieved before Board presentation.
Estimated Disbursements: The proposed loan is expected to be disbursed
over a period of two and a half years. Given the measures already
taken by the Government, the first tranche of $75 million
equivalent would be available for disbursement after loan
effectiveness; the second tranche ($75 million equivalent) and
third tranche ($50 million equi%-alent) would be released after
the timely completion of agreed actions described in the
Development Policy Letter and the Action Plan and set odt in the
draft Loan Agreements.
Disbursements against the program would be as follows:
--- Bank Fiscal Years ---

REPORT AND RECOMNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
FOR A PROGRAM OF REFORM OF GOVERNMENT CORPORATIONS
1.01          I submit the following report and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of the Philippines for a total of US$200
million equivalent to support a Program of Reform of Government
Corporations. The loan would be repaid over 20 years, including five
years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate.
PAR.T I - THE ECONOMY
Background
1.02      In recent years, the Philippine economy has been buffeted by
events, both domestic and external, which have led to an abrupt
decline in economic growth and a severe reduction in living standards
for the majority of the population.   The restoration of growth and
deve .opment and the need to reduce poverty are priorities which the
Government is attempting to address, and for which it is seeking
assistance from the Bank.
1.03      Recent Bank economic reports have detailed the causes of the
crisis and the needs for policy reform (see aPhilippines: A Framework
for Economic Recovery" (Report No. 6530-PH, November 5, 1986) and
"Philippines: An Agenda for Adjustment and Growth (Report No. 5258-
PH, November 30, 1984)). In brief, these reports indicate that while
growth was rapid during the 1970s, the economy suffered from a number
of distortions in agricultural pricing, exchange rates, credit
allocation, and industrial protection which resulted in a pattern of
growth that could not be sustained.   Thus, by 1980,  the gains
available from new seed technologies and expanded irrigation in
agriculture were exhausted, as was the scope for expanded industrial
output based on import substitution. In addition, the external terms
of trade began to deteriorate, both because of higher energy prices
and lower prices for major Philippine exports. The growing world
recession also limited the growth of manufactured exports, which in
the previous decade had expanded at a rate of 25% per annum. Despite
the worsening balance-of-payments situation, the exchange rate was
allowed to appreciate (1979-83), further reducing the competitiveness
of manufactured exports and limiting their growth.
1.04          In response to the worsening economic situation,  the
Government embarked on an expanded investment program in order both to
reduce energy dependence and to provide a countercyclical stimulus.
As a result, public investment rose from about 6% of GNP in 1979 to
about 9% by 1982 (see Table 1.1); over half of this was undertaken by
public corporations.  The expanded investment program produced some
major benefits, such as substantially increasing the. share of domestic
energy in total supply (from 21% to 45%, 1979-85).  In other areas,
however, the program was not well conceived and produced projects
which either had very low returns or extremely long gestation periods.



-2-
In the private sector as well, many investments were overpriced,
poorly designed, or resulted in excess capacity or firms that could
not compete in world markets.  The viability of even sound projects,
furthermore, was undermined by the deterioration in domestic and
external conditions, including such diverse factors as declining
copper and sugar prices, a drop in tourism, and excess cupacity in the
world shipping industry.   Many of these private sector projects,
however, were financed with 3oans and guarantees from Government
Financial Institutions (GFls). Project failures led to growing losses
for these institutions, which eventually had to be covered (1984-86)
by subsidies from the national budget.

1.05      While public investment expanded during the 1980s, the level
of public savings declined.  The public sector savings-investment gap
widened from 3% to 6% of GNP during 1980-82 and was largely financed
by foreign bank credits, which were then readily available. The low
level of public savings was directly related to the growing deficits
of the public corporations and an inefficient and inelastic tax system
that did not respond to the growth in the tax base. Thus, the
Government had to introduce new taxes and raise existing rates
frequently in order to maintain existing revenue levels, and it
increasingly turned to foreign and domestic borrowing to fill the
financing gap. Likewise, public corporations often turned to foreign
borrowing to finance their growing investment programs, with little
direct control on borrowings being exercised by the national
government.   Paralleling the domestic deficit, the current account
deficit of the balance of payments rose during the same period, from
about 4% of GNP to 8%.



-3-
1.06          The increased use of external borrowings to cover the
balance-of-payments gap resulted in a rise in the overall level of
debt outstanding, from US$13 billion at the end of 1979 to US$24
billion as of the end of 1984, or roughly 70% of total GNP. The debt
service ratio rose to a peak of 37% in 1982, and the balance-of-
payments equilibrium continued to be maintained by increased reliance
on short-term debt and roll-overs of existing debt maturities. By the
end of 1983, about 40% of total debt outstanding was short-term, one
of the highest proportions of short-term debt of any of the heavily
indebted countries. The high debt burden and the heavy reliance on
short-term debt made the country extremely vulnerable to external
shocks.   The combination of the growing debt problems in the
developing world and the political uncertainty following the Aquino
assassination resulted in a cessation of credit lines from commercial
banks in 1983 and in the need to declare a debt moratorium and to seek
debt relief.
Stabilization and Adjustment. 1983-1986
1.07      Beginning in 1983, the Government embarked en a major stabi-
lization effort, designed to reduce the deficit in the budget, lower
the balance-of-payments gap, and obtain a restructuring of its
external debt.  In the initial stages, controls were reintroduced on
foreign exchange transactions, imports were restricted, and tariffs
increased.   While these measures succeeded in reducing imports and
stabilizing the balance of payments, they also helped accelerate
inflationary pressures, which were being fueled by a rapid increase in
the monetary base.  Inflation reached a peak of 50% during 1984 but
had been brought under control by 1985 as a result of tight monetary
and fiscal policies. Total output, however, declined with GNP growth
rates of -7% in 1984 and -4% in 1985.  Public investment was reduced
by over 50% (1983-85), and private investment fell by about 35% (see
Table 1.1).
1.08       To deal with the ecoLnomic crisis, the Government adopted a
stabilization program supported by an IMF Standby Agreement in
December 1984, and extended by a further agreement in October 1986.
External debt service obligations to private banks and official
bilateral creditors were rescheduled in 1985 and 1987. The peso was
allowed to float and exchange controls, introduced in the 1983 crisis
period,  have been eliminated.    Important structural  reforms were
initiated in the sugar and coconut subsectors designed to improve
accountability and marketing efficiency. Restrictive import controls
on many basic commodities, including rice, have been eliminated. The
Government carried out a comprehensive review of its investment
program for the period 1986-89, and reduced the program to an
essential minimum. As a result, public investment was reduced from
7.3% of GNP in 1983, to 4.5% in 1984 and an estimated 3.6% in 1985.
1.09      Overall, the objectives of the stabilization program have
been met or surpassed.   GNP growth became positive  in 1986  and
accelerated to a 5% rate in 1987. Inflation has remained modest; the
consumer price index registered increases of only 0.8% in 1986 and



-4-
3.9% in 1987. The current account has swung from a 3.9% of GNP deficit
in 1984 to a balanced position in 1985 and back to a small deficit in
1987.
1.10      Poverty and Unemlovuent.  The decline in real incomes that
accom?manied the stabilization program has exacerb&ted the problems of
poverty and unemployment. Despite rapid economic growth in the past,
the incidence of poverty has remained high, ner caisQa consumption .,as
declined (see Table 1.2), income distribution has continued to be
skewed,  and regional  disparities  have  remained  pronounced.    The
national incidence of poverty in 1985 is estimated to be about 52% and
is considerably higher in the least-developed regions.   Declining
sugar prices and production have had a particularly adverse effect in
sugar-producing areas such as Negros, including high levels of
unemployment and malnutrition.   The slow growth of employment
opportunities in manufacturing, rising man/land ratios in the rural
areos, and relatively rapid population growth have all contributed to
a declining trend for real wages.   This  trend has been further
exacerbated during the stabilization period, when ner capita incomes
declined by abouit 15% (1982-96). Unemployment increased during the
same periods, and, despite the recent resumption in growth, is
estimated to be about 10% in the country as a whole, with
significantly higher rates in Metro-Manila.   The population growth
rate, which was until recently estimated to be about 2.5%, is likely
to be much higher, pre.bablv on the order of 2.7-2.9%. As a result of
these factors, the restoration of growth is an urgent priority, as is
the necessity to place new emphasis on programs that provide basic
services, particularly in the rural areas.

1.11        Public Finance.   The most immediate problem facing the
Government at present is the management of public expenditures.
Because of the structure of the tax system, poor tax administration,
and growth in public expenditures, the budget deficit tended to grow
in the early 1980s. From a level of about 2.3% of GNP during the late
1970s, the overall public sector deficit increased to a peak of 5.8%



-5-
in 1982. Since 1983, the Government has been faced with the need to
reduce the budget deficit in order to maintain price stability, while
the economic recession has both reduced the tax base and made it
difficult to enact new tax measures, Moreover, expenditures have been
squeezed by the need to provide growing subsidies to financial and
non-financial government corporations. Recent reform of the GFIs,has
reduced their burden on the budget somewhat. However, equity and net
lending required by Non-Financial Government Corporations (NFGCs) was
P 10.4 billion in 1987, or about 10% of total revenues. In contrast,
the capital expenditures for 1987 in the national government budget
total only P14 billion. Recent tax reforms and improved collection
efforts have raised tax collection to 12% of CNP (compared to 10% in
1984), but revenue picture remains tight. Interest expense alone now
takes 36% of total revenues, as a result of high external diebt
payments and domestic debts absorbed from the GFIs. In 1987,
significant progress was made in restoring investment and O&M
expenditures to more appropriate levels; further progress is planned
for 1988.

1.12       Major problems continue, however, because of the subsidies
required to support the operations of NFGCs (see Table 1.4).   The
level of internal cash generation is only a fraction of overall public
corporate investments. During the period 1984-86, transfers to the 15
largest corporations from the national budget were required to cover
about one half of the cash deficit of these firms.   The deficits of
these corporations accounted for about 40% of the total sector deficit
in 1986, and over 50% in 1985.   Yet, because of the shortage of
resources within the corporations, many important maintenance and
investment expenditures had to be deferred or delayed, leading to a
deterioration in the quality of many important government services,

including power, irrigation and water supply. Thus, an efficient and
financially viable public corporate sector is a critical element In
the overall recovery of the economy.

Medium-Term ProsRects
1.13      Since February 1986 there has been a change in government.
and the new administration has plac'&d a high priority on economic
recovery. The overall approach of the Government, as contained in the
recently approved Medium-lerm Development Plan, emphasizes certain key
economic principles. These include:
(a)  greater attention to poverty alleviation and social justice;
(b)  acceleration of growth and increased economic efficiency;
and
(c)  reduced government involvement in the economy and an emphasis
on private initiative.
1.14      The role of the Government is clearly seen as intervening in
the economy only in those areas where the private sector cannot meet
social needs, and where there is comparative advantage for public
action. Heavy emphasis will be placed on programs to reduce poverty,
raise employment, particularly in rural areas, and accelerate
agricultural production and exports.  The Government is committed to
reducing special privileges, tax exemptions, and subsidies for special
interest groups.
1.15       Several important policy measures have been undertaken to
facilitate future sustained growth.   A  revised public  investment
program was approved by the Cabinet in November 1986.   A major tax
reform has been initiated which includes the introduction of a value-
added tax.   Continued progress has been made in liberalizing trade



-7-
restrictions.   A major rehabilitation program  for GFIs has been
adopted and progress is being achieved in privatizing acquired assets
and government corporations.
1.16     The  government program is supported by multilateral, other
official and private creditors.   An 18-month agreement with the IMF
for the amount of SDR 442 million was approved in November 1986.
Government also successfully concluded negotiations with the Paris
Club to reschedule 100% of principal and 70% of interest falling due
over an 18-month period commencing January 1987.   Negotiations with
private creditors for a multi-year rescheduling of payments falling
due in 1987-92 was successfully concluded in 1987.   This agreement
will reschedule about US$9 billion of commercial debt with repayments
over ten years, following a seven year g.ace period. The Government
has also instituted a debt-equity swap program as another mechanism to
reduce the overall debt burden.
1.17         The Bank is supporting the Government program through
lending operations which have been oriented towards quick-disbursing
loans with a focus on macroeconomic and sectoral policy reform.   A
US$300 million Economic Recovery Loan (ERL) was approved by the Bank's
Board on March 17, 1987.  The Bank is involved in aid coordination
through its chairmanship of a Consultative Group, which met in January
1987 in Paris.  Subcommittee meetings of this group have been held
periodically to monitor new developments.   In formulating its
assistance, the Bank has cooperated closely with the IMF. The current
Standby Agreement reinforces the structural reforms supported by the
ERL.
1.18      In the long term, the solution to the economic crisis lies
with a resumption of growth in output and exports.   The challenge
faced by the Government in the coming year will be to restore growth
without a resumption of inflation while maintaining a viable balance
of payments.   Essential elements in the recovery program will be
measures to accelerate exports, increase public and private savings,
and use investment resources more efficiently than in the past.
Attention will have to be directed at industrial restructuring, reform
of the financial system, and institutional improvements in agricul-
ture. A combination of government actions, a restoration of private
sector confidence and increased external assistance should permit a
resumption of growth closer to historical experience or at an average
annual rate of about 4-5%, perhaps higher. Over the longer term,
therefore, the country remains creditworthy for new Bank borrowing on
conventional terms, despite current short-term difficulties.

PART II - THE PUBLIC CORPORATE SECTOR
Evolution and Growth of the Sector
2.01       The stated policy of governments in the Philippines, past
and present, has always been one of strong commitment to a private
sector economy.   In principle,  use of public enterprises Aj was
restricted to basic public services, acting as pioneers or pace-
setters for the national economy and laying the foundation for
accelerated economic development. Despite such commitments, the 1970s
witnessed a significant expansion of GCs: in 1951, there were only 13
GCs; by 1970, the number of parent corporations had increased to 46,
with an additional 18 subsidiaries.  Today, there are 15 GFIs and a
total of 296   GCs,  comprising 93 parent corporations and 203
subsidiaries in virtually every sphere of economic and social
activity. At the end of 1985, the GCs had assets of about P 743
billion and employed about 156,000 people, with the 15 GFIs accounting
for combined assets of P 422 billion and the 281 NFCCs for total
assets of p 321 billion (Annex 9).
2.02       The GCs invested heavily during the rapid economic growth
of the 1970s. During 1975-82, investments of the major NFGCs alone
averaged 4.5-5% of GNP.   This  was more than half of total public
sector investment and about 15% of total national investment.
Although the GCs' projected investments in 1985-90 are expected to
drop to around 2.5% of GNP, this would still amount to a significant
40% of total public sector investment and about 13% of total national
investment.
2.03       The contribution of the GCs to the national budgetary and
external debt burdens has become significant in recent years, due to
inadequate internal resource mobilization resulting from poor
financial performance.   The rate of return on total funds employed in
fl Public enterprises in the Philippines are commonly referred to as
Government Corporations (GCs) or Government-Owned and Controlled
Corporations (GOCCs). The tens GC is used for all corporate entities
in which the Government either owns the majority of shares or has
voting control.   GCs may be either "parent corporations"   created
through a special law,   i.e., an Act of Parliament or Presidential
Decree, or "subsidiary corporations" created under the general
corporations law, the Corporations Code. In subsidiary corporations,
the majority of the capital stock is in the name of a government
agency or institution.   The GCs can be further divided into two
groups:  the GFIs and the NFGCs.  In addition to the CCs, there are
corporations which were originally privately owned but came under
government control by defaulting on financial obligations owed to
GFIs; these are called Non-Performing Accounts (NPAs).



-9-
1983, for instance, ranged from 6% for the financial corporations to
-10% for the educational,  social  and cultural corporations.   The
overall budgetary burden of the public corporate sector (mostly due to
government contributions to the sector) was between 1.5% and 3.6% of
GDP during 1978-83, reaching even higher levels in 1981 and 1982. The
public sector deficit, which was less than 5% of GDP until 1980,
escalated to 7.5% in 1981 and 8.1% in 1982.  The Philippine GCs have
also resorted to heavy external borrowing. Between 1975 and 1984, the
public sector external debt increased from about US$2 billion to over
US$13 billion, with some 70% of this debt each year resulting directly
or indirectly from the public corporate sector. During the last five
years (1983-87), however, although government transfers still averaged
about 1 5 billion, external borrowing by the NFGUs (which reached 110
billion in 1983) was almost eliminated, while their debt repayments
amounted to W7.4 billion during 1985-87.
Supervisory Institutions for Government Corporations
2.04       Responsibility for supervising the GCs is shared by various
line departments and core agencies. Each parent GC is attached to a
department or another government agency which is administratively
responsible  for the  functioning  of  the  corporation.    Investment
programs of the GCs (and those of other government agencies) are
evaluated by two interagency committees: the Development Budget
Coordination Committee (DBCC) chaired by the National Economic and
Development Authority (NEDA) the and the Investment Coordination
Committee (ICC) chaired by the Department of Finance (DOF).   Both
Committees include senior representatives of government planning,
budgeting and financial agencies. The ICC is primarily concerned with
coordinating investment policies for the GFIs, while the DBCC deals
with the overall planning of government funds for all GGs, i.e., both
GFIs and NFGCs.   NEDA and the Department of Budget and Management
(DBM) play a key role in approving the budget and investments of the
GCs.
2.05      The Government provides budgetary support to GC investments
in the form of equity contributions and current transfers.   The DBH
evaluates the corporations' proposals and presents recommendations for
review by the Cabinet and approval by the Congress.
2.06       The GCs are allowed to borrow subject to some restrictions.
For foreign loans, approval of the Central Bank (CB) and the Monetary
Board  is  required.    NEDA  also  has  to  certify  the  economic
justification of projects; the Department of Justice must rule on
their legality; and the DBE must certify that debt ceilings have not
been reached.   Domestic loans are not subject to formal government
control unless a government guarantee is required, but the available
funds are quite limited.
2.07       The debt financing and capital expenditure programs of the
NFGCs are monitored by the Government Corporate Monitoring and
Coordinating Committee (UCMCC) to ensure compliance with targets set
under  the IMF stabilization program  (para.  1.08).    The  list of
corporations to be monitored is approved by the President and



- 10 -
presently includes 18 GCs. The 0CMCC was created in 1984 as a result
of discussions between the Government,  the IMF and the   Bank
regarding the country's financial problems. Under the proposed
project, GCMCC's mandate and composition was broadened and
strengthened to eaable it to assume responsibility for the monitoring,
performance evaluation and control of the GCs (para. 3.27).
Sectoral Issues and Constraints
2.08       The Philippine public corporate sector is characterized by
an inordinately high number of GCs, lack of a clear rationale for
Government involvement, and continuing financial losses. These
problems result from:
(a)   an  inadequate  policy  framework  for  the  creation  of
corporations   and  the   resultant  proliferation  of
corporations.   From 1970 to the present,  the number of
corporations increased from 46 to 296 due to the absence of
a well-defined policy on the creation, operation,
dissolution and divestiture of CCs.  This was reinforced by
the tendency of the sectoral departments and parent
corporations to create subsidiaries, partly to avoid the
control of government financial, budgetary,  and auditing
agencies.   The result has been duplication of activities
among GCs and the creation of GCs in areas where the private
sector has a comparative advantage;
(b)   inadequate  institutional arrangements for monitoring and
control of the sector.  Monitoring and control of GCs has
thus far focused on adherence to procedures, rather than
on operational and financial performance.       The primary
responsibility for monitoring and control has been with the
sectoral departments to which the corporations were
attached, but no guidelines existed on how to implement this
supervision. Moreover, the appointment of some government
Secretaries and Undersecretaries to as many as 12 CC Boards
of Directors resulted in either excessive dependence on the
Government or their inadequate supervision. In addition,
since   each   core   agency   has   narrow   supervisory
responsibilities -- NEDA for investment approval, DBM for
budget, CB and the Department of Finance (DOF) for borrowing
authority -- these controls were often exercised in an
uncoordinated and unsystematic manner, resulting in
inconsistent treatment of the GCs; and
(c)  poor operating and financial management and performance at
the corporation level.   Inadequate attention to financial
returns, lack of coordination among the controlling agencies
and lax financial discipline led to careless capital
expenditures, large staff increases and excessive external
financing by the GCs.   Lack of accounting standards,
unsatisfactory accounting practices and substantial
differences in the quality of audits combined to disguise
the true magnitude of the problems, which were further



- 11 -
compounded by politically motivated management appointments.
As a result, the GCs performed poorly and their huge
financial deficits had to be borne by the Government.
Background to the Reform Program for Government Cornorations
2.09        As the country's economic crisis worsened in the early
1980s, the rapid growth of the public corporate sector, its
contribution to the public sector deficit, and its share in the
external debt burden all became matters of serious concern to the
Philippine Government and to institutions providing financial
assistance to the Philippines.   Consequently,  in October 1984, the
Government requested the Bank's assistance to help formulate and
implement a program of public enterprise reforms. The Bank's ensuing
dialogue with government authorities led to the development of a
project to rationalize and improve the efficiency of the GCs by
supporting a program of policy reforms and institution building. The
GC reform package for GFIs, including the rehabilitation of the major
GFIs and acquired banks, became an important element of the ERL (para.
1.17). There is understandably overlap and commonality in terms of
legal framework and implementation arrangements between the ERL and
the proposed operation, which were both prepared in close
coordination.   The overall  focus of the proposed reform program
includes the overall rationalization of the corporate sector and
provision of an improved legal framework, the disposition of assets to
be privatized, the implementation of other non-privatization
dispositions, and the improvement of the retained corporations.
2.10     The change  in government in February 1986 temporarily slowed
project preparation, since the new Government needed time to analyze
studies which had been prepared by the Presidential Commission on
Government Reorganization (PCGR) and undertaken by a government team
assisted by local consultants. Additional time was also required to
solve difficult economic, political and military challenges presented
to the new Government, obtain the approval of the new Constitution and
elect and install a new Congress. Having accomplished these tasks, the
Government went on to strongly endorse the proposed reform program,
approve all necessary legal instruments for the program, create, fund
and staff organizations to carry out the progrant, and approve the
disposition of most of the GCs.
Actions Taken to Date
2.11      Substantial progress has been achieved during the last two
years in the detailed preparation of the Reform Program. Indeed, to
accelerate the structural adjustment process involved in reforming the
public corporate sector, the Government has formulated and approved
the program's main policy framework, established the required basic
mechanisms and begun implementation of the adjustment program. What
remains is the continuation of these actions for the completion of the
program. The policies and actions already adopted and implemented
include:



- 12 -
(a) approval by the President of the required legal instruments
setting the policy and legal frameworks for the program
(para. 3.03);
(b)  establishment of a Committee on Privatization (COP) and an
Asset Privatization Trust (APT) (paras. 3.12-3.16) and
approval of APT's operating guidelines, budget, and staffing;
(c) approval of operating guidelines for GCMCC (para. 3.23);
(d) approval of the Corporate Affairs Group (CAG) to act as the
technical arm for GCMCC and establishment of its budget and
staffing (para. 3.27);
(e) formulation by DBN and review by COP/GCKCC of recommendations
for the disposition and rationalization of GCs (paras. 3.08-
3.10);
(f) establishment by COP of privatization guidelines and
procedures to be followed by APT and the other disposition
entities (para. 3.13);
(g) preparation of privatization plans for GCs approved for
privatization (para. 3.13);
(h) preparation of draft corporate plans for five major GCs
(para. 3.32);
(i) implementation of Executive Order No. 518 requiring GCs to
declare dividends equivalent to 5% of their net earnings;
Cj) introduction of an interest rate of 5% p.a. for the GCs'
outstanding debt and current treasury bill rates for new
lending from the Government;
(k) establishment of standard procedures, based on generally
accepted accounting principles, for accounting and auditing
of GCs (paras. 3.36-3.38);
(1) establishment of fiscal autonomy for the Commission on Audit
(COA), with COA financed by budgetary allocations and the GCs
paying audit fees to the Government (para. 3.38); and
(m)  disposition of some initial NPAs and GCs, with the sale in
1987 of five GCs and about 21% of the number of NPAs and
sales or partial sales reaching 6% of their book value (para.
3.19).



- 13 -
2.12      On the broader macroeconomic front, the Government has been
successfully implementing a program approved by the IMF Executive
Directors on October 24, 1986 which involves the limitation of the
annual national budget deficit to 4.4% of GNP, a growth rate in the
monetary base of no more than 11%, and minimum levels for
international reserves.   These are to be supplemented by economic
policy measures undertaken in connection with the BRL.   All these
actions taken to date clearly indicate the strong commitment of the
Government to implement important policy reforms.
Rationale for Bank Involvement
2.13     The Bank, through its lending operations, has been providing
support to almost all major GCs in the Philippines.   Through its
industrial development finance and agricultural credit operations, the
Bank has sought to strengthen the Development Bank of the Philippines
(DBP), the country's main development finance intermediary.
Similarly, through energy, irrigation, urban development, water supply
and sewerage, and ports projects, among others, the Bank has sought to
address enterprise-specific issues affecting some of the major GCs.
The results of these operations have, however, been mixed in terms of
institution-building and policy reforms.   Greater gains could have
been realized if effective systems of coordination and performance
monitoring had been in place lit the national level to complement the
institution-building efforts being carried out at the enterprise
level. The proposed project, in conjunction with the ERL (Report No.
P-4466-PR, February 23, 1987), provides a unique opportunity to
relieve these constraints by addressing the issues affecting the
performance and efficiency of all public corporations. To this end,
the Government has requested the Bank to act as a catalyst to help
formulate, analyze and implement a program of reforms for the
structural adjustment of the public corporate sector.  The Bank has
therefore helped to organize the activities of task forces which have
been working for the last three years, producing detailed proposals
for the Government's consideration. The reform program designed on the
basis of these proposals is expected to improve the overall management
of the sector and to strengthen the organization and policies of
several of the Bank's major borrowers.   This in turn should help
reduce the burden that the corporate sector represents to the economy.
It is expected that completion of all stages of the reform program
will,  in the future1    require  additional,  separate  sectoral
operations, some of which are currently being prepared.



- 14 -
PART III - THE PROPOSED OPERATION
Program Objectives and Components
3.01      The proposed Reform Program constitutes the foundation of a
series of phased structural adjustments to the policies, organization,
and direction of the Philippine public corporate sector. The Program,
together with the sector's new legal framework already approved by the
Government (para. 3.03), establishes an appropriate policy and
institutional framework for the Government's future use of the
corporate form. Pursuant to these policies, appropriate steps will be
taken to reduce, limit and rationalize government corporate
activities, initiate improvements in the efficiency, cost recovery and
effectiveness of GCs,   and gradually reduce the heavy burden that
public corporations currently impose on the Philippine economy.  The
Reform Program, defined in the Government's Letter of Development
Policy (Annex 4), has the following key elements:
(i)    Passage of legislation and issuance of a policy statement
enunciating government policies for the establishment and
operation of duz.
(ii)   Issuance of legal instruments  improving the sector's
institutional framework and defining the functions and
responsibilities of the government agencies dealing with
GCs, their boards of directors and chief executives.
(iii) Rationalization of the existing corporate portfolio  and
appropriate disposition of all GCs through their
privatization, consolidation, conversion to private
nonprofit status, transfer to ministries or abolition. This
process is expected to reduce the number of GCs from 296 to
37 and to eliminate most of the subsidies required for the
sector.
(iv)  Institutional strengthening of the retained corporations
through the establishment of an oversight mechanism, GCMCC,
to establish long-term planning, monitor the corporate
sector, and introduce measures to help improve GC
performance.
(V) Technical assistance to support the above efforts.
3.02       There is clear consensus in the Philippines on the need for
these reforms, which have already begun to be initiated
satisfactorily. Agreement has been reached with the Government on the
measures needed and on their implementation in accordance with a
proposed Policy Matrix (Annex 6) and Action Plan (Annex 7). A chart
showing institutional responsibilities for program implementation is
given in Annex 8. The proposed operation would broaden and expand the
reorganization of GCs begun under the ERL, with both operations



- 15 -
sharing common policy and institutional frameworks (para. 3.12). The
proposed reform package is also consistent with and supports the IMF
program to monitor the financial performance and expenditure programs
of the major GCs. Program details are described below.
I.   Legal Framework and Policy Statement
3.03       The proposed Program is based on an improved legal frame-
work for the sector which has been provided by a number of legtl.
instruments approved by the President of the Philippines.   These
include  Administrative  Order  (A.O.)  59  (February  16,  1988).
"Rationalizing the Government Corporate Sector"; Executive Order
(E.O.) 236 (July 22, 1987), "Strengthening the Government Corporate
Monitoring and Coordinating Committee"; the GCMCC Guidelines (January
22, 1988); E.O. 127-A (July 22, 1987), "Creating the Corporate Affairs
Group"; E.O. 164 (May 5, 1987), "Providing Additional Guidelines in
the Processing and Approval of Contracts of the National Government";
and Proclamations 50 and 50A (December 8 and 16, 1986), "Proclaiming
and Launching a Program for the Expeditious Disposition and
Privatization of Certain Government Corporations and/or Assets
Thereof, and Creating the Committee on Privatization and the Asset
Privatization Fund." The policies promulgated in this legislation are
also reflected in the Letter of Development Policy signed by the
Government  on  April  27,  1988.        Together,  these  documents
satisfactorily define the basic policies, role and organization of the
government corporate sector in the economy.  The key policy changes
introduced are summarized in the Policy Matrix (Annex 6). In
particular, these policies direct that:
(a) the private sector should have a primary role in undertaking
economic activities;
(b)  the Government may intervene in the economy when the goods
and services involved are vital to society and the private
sector is unwilling or unable to provide adequate services,
or when Government intervention is justified by the need to
create a bias in favor of disadvantaged sectors of the
society. In such -cases, GCs rather than line departments
would be used when greater flexibility is desirable, or when
the Government wishes to limit its direct equity exposure;
(c) GCs should be financially independent, require minimal
government support, and operate without any special privilege
or assistance from the Government;
(d) GCs not complying with the above criteria will be disposed of
and the corporate sector rationalized by: (i) partial or
total privatization; (ii) abolition; (iii) conversion into
private nonprofit status; (iv)   consolidation with another
GC; or (v) regularization, i.e., abolition of the GC and
transfer of its functions, personnel, assets and liabilities
to a regular line agency of the Government;
(e) GCs will have adequate flexibility and autonomy, but within a



- 16 -
framework of government supervision, monitoring and
evaluation; and
(f)  subsidies may be granted only to create a bias in favor of
disadvantaged sectors of the society, or to protect the
operational viability of GCs in case of disastrous events or
when Government mandates the GCs to undertake activities
which are not financially viable.
II. Institutional Framework
3.04    To implement the above mentioned objectives and policies, the
Government established special institutions as follows:
(a)  GCICC to monitor the application of government corporate
policies, particularly to approve the creation and
acquisition of new GCs and to carry out the improvement,
monitoring and performance evaluation of retained GCs.  A
Corporate Affairs Group (CAG) was also established in DOF to
serve as technical secretariat for GCMCC;
(b)  COP to oversee implementation of the divestment program and
APT and other Disposition Entities (DE) to carry out the
privatization; and
gc)  the Presidential Commission on Government Reorganization
(PCGR) analyzed the corporate sector, prepared a legal
framework for the sector and provided the President with
recommendations for disposition of GCs. After completing its
work, PCGR was dissolved and its role and functions
transferred to DBM, which in coordination with the respective
departments is responsible for the abolition, consolidation,
conversion and regularization of GCs.
3.05       Legislation has also been introduced in the Congress to
allow differential compensation for employees of GCs. More flexible
personnel policies for GCs would be developed under the program (para.
3.39).
III.   Corporate Rationalization Program
3.06     Program Development and Scone.  During the last three years,
the Government, with the help of local consultants, has carried out
detailed studies analyzing the organization, finances, markets and
prospects of each GC. Following the policies enunciated above (para.
3.03), and   in agreement with the Bank, rules and criteria were
established to rationalize the existing portfolio of 296 GCs.
Excluded from this Program were assets of corporations which have been
sequestered by the Government, pursuant to investigations pertaining
to the legality of actions by the previous Government relating to such
corporations. These corporations are being handled separately by the
Presidential Commission on Good Government, but would also be
eventually be disposed of by APT, subject to the resolution of
relevant legal issues.



-17-
3.07      The objectives of the corporate rationalization program are
to:
(a) increase the efficiency and productivity of the economy by
allowing fair competition and withdrawing the Government fron
activities which could be performed more efficiently by the
private sector;
(b) minimize the Government's role and involvement in GCs and
reduce the present burden of its loans and contributions to
GCs, which have been a major cause of the public sector
deficit; and
(c) concentrate efforts and resources in improving the efficiency
of the GCs that will remain in the public sector.
3.08    Rationalization Recommendations.  Based on the above-mentioned
studies, DBK, in consultation with the departments concerned, has
prepared recommendations for the rationalization of the corporate
sector and the disposition of each GC. COP/CGKCC have already agreed
on the disposition of much of the portfolio. The disposition of 230
GCs (78% in number and 95% in value of total GC assets) has already
been approved by the President. Disposition recommendations for the
other 66 GCs (representing about 22% in number and 5% in the value of
total GCs assets in 1985) are being finalized.   Final approval for
these 66 GCs would be a condition for release of the second tranche of
the proposed loan.
3.09           According to  the approved disposition or  to DBK's
recoimnendations  (detailed in Annex 9),   only 37  (12.5%) of the
existing 296 GCs are expected to remain in the public sector. On this
basis, an estimated P 137 billion (in 1985 prices) of the GCs' gross
assets would be removed from the public corporate sector, -reducing by
about P 8 billion the annual budgetary allocations. This would also
represent a gradual transfer to the private sector of about 55,000
employees.  Excluding three special corporations (the Central Bank,
the Development Bank of the Philippines and the Social Security
System), the GCs to be retained (including consolidations) had assets
in 1985 of P 228 billion, representing a reduction of 88% in number
and 42% in value of the government corporate sector. Privatization of
discrete parts of the GCs being retained is also being implemented.
The drastic reduction in the absolute number of corporations and the
changes in departmental attachments would result in no single
department supervising more than six corporations, with the average
number being four.
3.10       The rationalization program envisages the following changes
(see Annex 9 for details) for the other 259 GCs not being retained:
privatization of some 132 GCs (44.6% of total), most of them engaged
in productive activities   but having a net drain on economic
resources; liquidation or abolition of about 67 GCs (22.6%) for which
there would be little interest in the private sector; consolidation
with their parent corporations or other corporations in the se



- 18 -
subsector of 16 OCs (5.4%) to eliminate existing duplications of
purpose or function; regularization (incorporation into relevant
government departments) of 36 GCs (12.2%) which have functions not
suitable to the corporate form; and conversion to nonprofit private
entities of 8 GCs (2.7%).   The value of assets, liabilities, equity
and the number of employees, excluding the three special corporations
mentioned in para. 3.09 are shown in Table 3.1.

3.11      Institutional Arrangements for the Reform Program.  DOF will
undertake overall coordination of the proposed program. GCMCC will be
responsible for measures to improve the corporate sector (para. 3.25).
The rationalization program will be implemented by COP and DB3.  COP,
with the support of the concerned disposition entities (DEs), i.e.,
APT and a few major parent corporations (para. 3.13), will complete
the privatization program, while DBM, with the support of relevant
departments and parent corporations, will be responsible for all other
disposition actions.
3.12         Disposition Entities for Privatization.   Institutional
arrangements for the divestiture program established jointly under the
ERL and this program are in place. Divestiture of both GCs and NPAs
would be carried out under the overall responsibility of COP, an
interministerial body comprising the Secretaries of Finance
(Chairman), Trade and Industry, Justice, Budget and Management and the
Director-General of NEDA.   COP analyzes and submits to the President
for approval the recommendations for privatization (para. 3.08);
approves the terms of individual disposition proposals prepared by
DEs; and monitors and reviews the progress of the entire privatization



- 19 -
program. COP also recommends for the President's approval candidates
for the APT Board, including their Executive Trustees, and approves
the DEs' guidelines and budgetary requirements.   The APT program is
managed by a Board of Executive Trustees comprising five full-time
members drawn from senior executive levels of private industry.
Operating guidelines approved for APT are satisfactory, as are its
organization, staffing, budget and work program (details available in
the Project File). Although APT's budget for 1988 is almost unchanged
from 1987, when its staffing was still incomplete, this is not
expected to be a constraint since APT's operational expenditures in
1987 were P 6 million and they can be recovered from sale proceeds,
which already reached P 3,800 million in 1987.
3.13        Under COP's guidance, the actual sale of GCs would be
carried out by the DEs.   Although APT is the main DE for all
government assets, in view of its widespread commitment to the
disposal of more than 300 NPAs and a large number of sequestered
assets, its role in privatization of GCs would be initially limited to
the privatization of some 40 GCs (10 of which are already transferred
to APT).   The remaining privatization will be undertaken by the
parent corporations (mainly the National Development Corporation, the
Philippine National Oil Company, and the Department of Agriculture).
The knowledge of the parent corporations about the GCs to be
privatized is expected to accelerate and simplify the sales of the
respective GCs. To ensure that adequate, comparable and transparent
methods are followed by all DEs, on August 15,  1987 COP issued
detailed guidelines for privatization. The guidelines set procedures
for COP monitoring of all privatization actions,   require the
preparation of detailed privatization plans for each CC, and provide
guidelines for valuation of assets, identification of potential
investors, disposition methods, etc. Detailed privatization plans have
been approved by COP for most GCs approved for privatization. These
plans describe the proposed privatization, provide financial and
operational highlights of the GCs, recommend the privatization system
(sale of assets or shares), valuation method, the schedule and program
of privatization activities and provide information on any special
factors which may affect the privatization. The DEs are required to
provide COP with periodic progress reports on the privatization
program; COP in turn is required to submit periodic progress reports
to the President and the Congress. If satisfactory progress is not
achieved within a reasonable period of time, COP will assign the
completion of privatization to APT. The price, buyer, terms of
disposition, and any rehabilitation or restructuring of corporations
are subject to the prior approval of COP, which is the final authority
in such matters.
3.14      Each DE will carry out the following functions:
(a)  formulation of a detailed action plan with the intention of
completing the sale of all entrusted assets not later than
December 31, 1991;
(b) execution and/or management of all activities related to the
divestiture of specific OCs, such as enterprise analysis,



- 20
asset valuation,  determination  of   appropriate  sales
procedures, identification of potential buyers, estimation
of sales values, tntroduction of legal and institutional
changes required for the transactions, calls for bids and,
if needed,  for negotiation of torms of  sale  (including
financial packaging and work force rodep.oyment schemes);
(c)  oversight  of  the maintenance  of  the  assets  and  the
improvement of the corporations'   operations until their
disposition, including measures which may be required to
improve their saleability. Rehabilitatiorn requiring capital
expenditures will be undertaken only in exceptional cases to
be approved by COP; and
(d)  hiring of external expertise and technical assistance  to
support the privatization program.
3.15          The DEs will have a lean staff, supported by ad hoc
advisors and consultants in finance, law, operations, accounting,
auditing and public relations/marketing to provide highly specialized
support and to ensure that all transactions are designed and
implemented in a consistent and coordinated manner. The APT's staff
includes the five Trustees and 42 other personnel. Although APT was
able to complete 46 bids and dispose of about 21% of NPAs in 1987
without any special technical assistance, the disposition of GCs will
require consultant and logistical support. COP has preliminary
approval of the United States Agency for International Development
(USAID) for a US$5.0 million grant to assist in completing the
privatization (see Annex 12).   Privatization of individual GCs and
NPAs would be executed in the context of the priorities of the overall
privatization program and the particular constraints (mainly legal
requirements) of each GC. Wherever possible, the Government would
leave capital-intensive restructuring or rehabilitation efforts to the
private sector.
3.16        Budgetary savings resulting from privatization would be
generated only over the long term because (a) the most logical
candidates for early transfer to the private sector would be the most
viable corporations and thus the least costly to the Government, and
(b) GCs which are heavily indebted or subsidized would need to be sold
at a discount or have substantial debt written off before they can be
sold.   Although many GCs have negative equities,  their sales are
likely to result in a positive capital inflow for the Government,
since the liabilities to be paid are mostly with other government
entities. Total sales of assets by APT and the other DEs reached P 8.9
billion in 1987; higher levels are expected in 1988, which would
result in considerable cash inflows that would help support the
privatization program. Nevertheless, although the end results of
privatization would be a reduction in budgetary allocations and cash
raised by sales, budgetary support is needed initially to sustain
disposition operations as well as to assume the liabilities of some
GCs. Budgetary requirements would vary with the speed of disposition
and depend on many externalities. Initial budgetary requirements for
APT and other DE (assumed by the parent corporations) are



- 21 -
satisfactory. Agreement was reached during negotiations that the
Government would continue to provide adequate budgetary funds to
support the privatization and rationalization program.
3.17      Privatization Strateev.  The privatization strategy pursued
will seek to achieve a reasonable sale   price while taking into
account the limited absorptive capacity of the domestic capital market
and the need to minimize implementation constraints. Creative
financing schemes are already being implemented by APT. The Government
is consieering alternative privatization strategies to facilitate the
completion of the program in less than five years. These include:
(a) partial privatization, particularly for large companies;
this includes the option of stock ownership plans for
management and employees;
(b) debt/equity swaps;
(c) joint ventures with domestic or foreign partners' providing
capital and/or technology;
(d) privatization of the management and operation of GCs
(management contracts);
(e) investment funds f4 to serve as financial intermediaries and
raise funds from individuals, corporations or pension funds.
These funds could be registered at foreign stock exchanges
or offered through private placements abroad and could help
mobilize remittances from Philippine nationals living
overseas.
3.18       It is difficult   to  forecast with precision the likely
demand among investors for the purchase of GCs scheduled for
privatization. However, improvements in the political and economic
environment in the country and the increased trading volume in the
Manila and Makati Stock Exchanges as evidenced by the higher turnover
ratio and the quadrupling of the stock market index in 1986 (Annex 10)
indicate increased investor confidence in Philippine equity markets
and bode well for the privatization efforts. Bids for the assets
already offered have been generally successful and prices reasonable.
3.19      Although the potential for successful privatization is good,
the local market may not have adequate financing capacity to absorb
quickly the volnuw  of sales envisaged:  the net book value of the 132
GCs targeted for privatization, P 15 billion, represents almost one
third of total market capitalization of the 127 companies currently
/4    In April 1987, IFC's Board of Directors approved a proposed
investment in the First Philippine Capital Fund, a "closed-end" fund
of a vinimum of US$125 million and a maximum of US$250 million. The
Fund will be managed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shearson Lehman
Hutton, Inc. It is structured as a limited partnership under the laws
of the State of Delaware, and will be marketed on a private placement
basis mainly in the United States, Japan, Europe and the Middle East.



- 22 -
listed on the Manila and Makati Stock Exchanges. Consequently, sales
to foreign investors are also contemplated. Considerable interest has
been expressed in the privatization program, which has been confirmed
by APT's sales, and indicates a reasonable demand for investment
opportunities. Considerable progress has already been achieved in
1987, with the divestiture of some 56 NPAs (and partial sales of
another 28 NPAs)  and five GCs.   This included  several  large
divestitures like the Commercial Bank of Manila (C 511 million), the
First Philippine Holding Corporation (0 416 million), the Cebu Plaza
Hotel (P 328 million), etc.   The experience acquired last year is
expected to further improve future results.
3.20        Even after the satisfactory progress of privatization in
1987, it is impossible to forecast when the privatization of any group
of assets will be completed, which depends not only on government
efforts, but also on the private sector's willingness and capacity to
purchase the assets. This is also tied to the general political and
economic stability of the country and, for a given corporation, the
judicial and in some cases the legislative approval of legal changes
or pending issues required for divestiture. Under these conditions and
given the short implementation period of this project, agreement was
reached at negotiations that all steps necessary to get in vendible
form and offer for sale 30 GCs, representing in 1985 at least 20% of
the gross assets approved for privatization of GCs, would be completed
before the release of the second tranche of the loar, and that release
of the third tranche would require that a cumulative total of 60 CCs,
representing in 1985 at least 50% of the 1985 gross assets approved
for privatization of GCs, would be in vendible form and offered for
sale. Puttiig the corporations into vendible form will be the critical
activity since the offer for sale follows normal bidding procedures.
Making them vendible requires the removal of legal impediments to the
sale, the settlement of creditors' claims, perfection of the title to
the assets, completion of an inventory and financial evaluation of the
CC.   After these steps are completed, the DE provides information
about each GC in a catalogue distributed to potential buyers.
3.21     Other Disposition Actions.  PCGR prepared most of the studies
and recommendations for other disposition actions during preparation
of the proposed project.    DBM would now be  responsible  for
implementing these and other disposition recommendations for
consolidation, conversion to nonprofit organizations, regularization
into line agencies or departments, and abolition.  Finalization by DBM
of an implementation plan agreed with the Bank for the consolidation,
regularization (absorption as line agencies or departments),
conversion, and abolition of about 100 GCs would be a condition for
the release of the second tranche; the achievement of satisfactory
progress toward amending the charters of such CCs would be conditions
for the release of the second and third tranches of the proposed loan.
The implementation of this plan (including satisfactory progress
towards anendments of charters of such GCC) and the preparation of an
action plan agreed with the Bank for the remaining consolidations,
regularizations, conversions and abolitions would be a condition for
release of the third tranche. Substantial work would be needed to
prepare the legal instruments necessary to change the CC charters.



- 23 -
For this purpose, DBM will work closely with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the relevant departments on charter
modifications.   DBM staff responsible for this part of the program
would consist only of a core group of six professionals who would be
supported, as needed, by consultants on an ad hoc, short-term basis.
Technical assistance for nonprivatization dispositions, mainly to
prepare legislation and evaluate the GCs (Annex 12), is expected to be
.financed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (para.
3.41).
IV. Retained Corporations: Institution Building and Improvements
3.22      The 37 corporations to be retained constitute a substantial
part, 57%, of the assets of the government corporate sector,
(excluding three special corporations para. 3.09). Moreover, tnese
corporations provide many essential services to the population (power,
water supply, irrigation, low-income housing, etc). Therefore, the
Reform Program emphasizes measures designed to improve their
performance and effectiveness, in particular:  (a)  an institutional
framework for departmental and interdepartmental supervision, and (b)
improvements in the performance of the corporations themselves. These
components are explained below.
Institutional Framework for Departmental and Interde artmental
Supervision
3.23      A.O. 59  provides guidelines for the respective roles of the
boards of the GCs, their chief executive officers, and the departments
to which the corporations are attached. The underlying principle in
these provisions is to provide operational autonomy to the Boards and
managements of GCs while maintaining reasonable control over their
performance and results. The A.O. defines the supervisory functions
of the departments in regard to the corporations attached, gives
operational autonomy to the GCs, describes the functions of the
Secretary of a Department vis-a-vis the corporations attached,
outlines the powers of governing boards and the chief executive,
establishes mechanisms to approve loans, prescribes periodic reporting
requirements and confirms the supervisory authority of parent
corporations over subsi&Laries. Under the improved legal framework,
the core agencies will retain most of their present functions,
although   their   coordination   would   be   improved   through
interdepartmental supervision carried out by GCMCC.   Specifically,
NEDA will continue to prioritize and evaluate investment projects; DBM
will continue to approve the budget, equity contributions, and other
funds allocated to individual corporations; and the Central Bank will
continue to be responsible for determining the GCs' foreign exchange
and credit budgets and for compiling banking system reports on
domestic corporate borrowings.   COA will audit CC accounts and the
Civil Service Commission (CSC) will enforce government personnel
regulations. Agreement was reached at negotiations that before the
release of the second tranche of the proposed loan the Government will
issue regulations to eliminate automatic government guarantees for
loans contracted by GCs and to provide that when GCs are required by



- 24 -
Government to undertake activities which are not financially viable,
the Government will take adequate and timely steps to protect the
financial viability of such GCs-, on the basis of arrangements between
the Government and the GCs as part of interdepartmental monitoring and
evaluation by the GCMCC. Satisfactory progress toward the amendments
of charters of GCs to incorporate the above-mentioned principles
regarding the Board of Directors, subsidies and automatic government
guarantees (para. 7 of Letter of Development Policy) is a condition
for the release of the second and third loan tranches.
3.24        The Government  would also review the charters of GCs and
thereafter take necessary action to ensure that: (a) where the
Chairman of a GC is the representative of the Department to which that
GC is attached, arrangements for interdepartmental monitoring and
evaluation by the GCMCC are appropriately, adjusted as necessary to
take into account this fact; and that the other responsibilities of
such representative are consistent with the need that the
representative devote adequate time and attention in the discharge of
his/her responsibilities as Chairman; and (b) where exofficio members
constitute the majority of the members of the Board of Directors of a
GC, the selection of the Departments represented on the Board in each
case adequately takes into account the relevance of the functions of
such Departments to the activities of the GC. The completion of this
review is a condition for the release of the second loan tranche, and
satisfactory progress in implementing the recommendations of the
review would be a condition for release of the third tranche.
3.25     GCMCC.  E-O  236 and its regulating guidelines establish an
interdepartmental supervision mechanism to oversee the   entire
government corporate sector and ensure uniformity in the supervisory
roles of the  various agencies.  This mechanism consists of GCMOC, a
Cabinet-level committee, which includes the Executive Secretary, the
Secretaries of Finance, Transportation and Communications,
Agriculture, Public Works and Highways, Environment and Natural
Resources, and Trade and Industry, and the Director of NEDA.   It is
chaired on a rotating basis, as decided by GCMCC. CCICC's objectives
are to enhance public accountability of GCs, promote the efficient
allocation and use of resources, instill financial discipline and
self-financing of GCs, and integrate corporate sector and government
goals and policies.
3.26       GCKCC is responsible to establish performance targets and
standards, monitor the implementation of audit recommendations,
conduct periodic reviews, appraise performance, and monitor the
operation of GCs against agreed targets. GCMCC will not get involved
in the management of the corporations, but will focus its attention on
performance and results. GCMCC will also develop and recommend to the
President incentives and sanctions to improve the performance of GCs.
GCMCC would have the support of a Technical Board which includes
representatives of the member agencies of GCZCC, as well as
representatives of DBM, the Central Bank and COA. The list of GCs to
be under GCMCC supervision would be expanded gradually. For 1988 it
includes 18 of the largest CCs, fifteen of which are the targets for
the initial implementation of the program (Annex 5).



- 25 -
3.27      The Corporate Affairs Group (CAG) will be GCCCC's technical
secretarint. CAG currently has a staff of 28 but would be expanded to
40 by June 30, 1989. To ensure that the full complement of CAG staff
benefit from the training and technical assistance planned for this
component (para. 3.41),   the appointment of adequate staff for CAG
would be a condition for the release of the second tranche of the
proposed loan. GAG will carry out the following functions for CCMCC:
(a) provide assistance to define policies and recommendations
regarding the corporate sector;
(b) develop, coordinate and evaluate the corporate planning of
GCs;
(c) develop criteria and procedures for monitoring and
evaluation of GCs;
(d) establish and monitor the implementation of a management
information system to rationalize the information
requirements of managers, departments, and GCMCC; and
(e) periodically evaluate the performance of all GCs.
Measures to Improve Performance of the Retained GCs
3.28         The GCs' lack of adequate financial responsibility and
operational accountability contributed to the country's present
economic crisis.   An improved system of financial discipline and
control for GCs is therefore essential and would be introduced under
the program through:
(a)  improvements in the organization, management and financial
structure of GCs;
(b)  introduction of corporate planning, performance monitoring
and evaluation, and a related incentive system;
(c) improvements in accounting and auditing; and
(d) provision of differential treatment.
3.29      These measures,  to be introduced gradually, are expected to
increase the efficiency and effectiveness of GCs, strengthen their
corporate planning capacity, improve management information systems,
and provide greater flexibility for GC operations.   During the first
project year, the above improvements would be introduced on a pilot
basis in the following five major GCs, with which the Bank has been
associated for many years: the National Power Corporation (NBC); the
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (HWSS); the National
Irrigation Authority (NIA); the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA); and
the National Housing Administration (NHA). During the second project
year, these measures would be introduced into another ten large GCs.



- 26 -
3.30      Improvements in the Organization.  Management and  Financial
Structure of GCs; Under the new legal framework (para. 3.03), the
organization, managerial and financial practices of   GCs would be
standardized, and the GCs' existing charters would be changed as
needed to conform with Government's policies and the present legal
framework (para. 3.23). The three main changes introduced relate to
Boards of Directors, government guarantees, and special privileges of
CCs.
(a)  Boards of Directors.   The new legal framework defines the
managerial responsibilities of CC boards of directors and
sets standards of technical competence, experience and
integrity for board members (para. 3.23).  Appointment and
removal procedures are also defined. The supervision of GCs
would henceforth be a responsibility of the supervising
secretaries, while the direction of the corporations is
entrusted to the GCs' Boards of Directors and their
management to their chief executives. The implementation of
these policies would require changes in the charters of some
GCs (paras 3.23 and 3.24).
(b)  Automatic Government Guarantees.  Provisions in CC charters
specifying  automatic  government    liability  for  GC
obligations have led to large indebtedness among the GCs and
have provided no incentives to improve their efficiency and
cost recovery. The Government's policy is that direct loan
guarantees or other government financial exposure will be
curtailed and will require specific justification and ad hoc
approval by GCMCC  and the President.    Unless  specific
approval is given, the Government would no longer
automatically guarantee the liabilities of any CC beyond
the Government's equity participation in that GC.   Such
policies will be reflected in new government regulations and
in changes made to the GC charters (paras. 3.23 and 3.24).
(c)  Elimination of SDecial Privileges and Benefits. Until
recently, most CCs enjoyed special exemptions (from income
and other taxes, fees, custom duties, etc.), particular
privileges  (monopolistic  rights and automatic government
guarantees for borrowings) and government financial
assistance, either from budgetary allocations or   the
provision of earmarked revenues and taxes. Tax exemptions
and privileges of GCs were withdrawn by E.O. 93 (December
17, 1986), and although its implementation has been uneven,
equity contributions were reduced and internal contributions
by the corporations were tripled between 1983 and 1987, from
P 2.1 billion in 1983 to P 6.1 billion in 1987. Dividends
paid to the Government by GCs increased from P 46 million to
P 126 million between 1986 and 1987. GCMCC is now
satisfactorily monitoring the implementation of these
policies.
3.31           Corporate Planning.  Long-term corporate planning  is
essential for GCs, which frequently undertake projects and loans, the



- 27 -
full effects of which in terms of expenses, debt service, revenues and
benefits are not fully felt until after the project is completed.
Although a few CCs have some corporate plannking experience, most
existing corporate plans do not promote thorough analysis of the
impact on the corporation of long-term investments or loans, nor do
they include an integrated financial model for analyzing the main
factors affecting financial performance and providing a reasonable
long-term financial forecast. A good start has been made through the
review of investment programs by GCGCC as part of the IMF
stabilization program. Under the proposed program, improved corporate
planning would be introduced to 15 large NFGCs, including a system of
management reports and performance indicators.   This will require
improvements in the capabilities of the GCs to prepare, and GCMCC and
CAG to revise and evaluate, proposed corporate plans and subsequently
to monitor performance.
3.32      The linchpin  of the improved corporate planning system is
the introduction, under the supervision of GCMCC, of a Corporate
Planning Model (CORPLAN) using micro computers. The CORPLAN model
includes a detailed analysis of demand, revenues, expenses, debt, and
investments. The model can be tailored and applied flexibly to the
specific circumstances of each corporation, but will provide standard
tables for investments, debt service, income, flow of funds, balance
sheets and financial plans.   To facilitate managerial  review of
corporate plans, CORPLAN provides graphs for the relevant indicators
of each corporation. Improvement of the corporate planning process has
already been initiated with the preparation of draft corporate plans
for the five pilot corporations   (NPC, MUSS, NIA, PPA and NHA). A
sample of CORPLAN's main tables is shown in Annex 11.   Initial
training in the design and use of the program, to be complemented by
technical assistance, has already been given to staff of the 15 GCs.
The approval of a corporate plan agreed with the Bank by the Board of
Directors of five GCs is a condition for disbursement of the second
tranche of the Bank loan. Similar corporate plans, as approved by the
respective Boards of Directors of another ter. large GCs, will be a
condition for disbursement of the third tranche.
3.33          Performance Monitoring  and Evaluation.        Government
monitoring of public corporations is currently limited to sporadic
interventions by the supervisory agencies, with the result that the
GCs have largely functioned without supervision or controls. Under the
reform program, a consistent and regular system will be introduced to
monitor and evaluate the results and performance of GCs. At the start
of each year, GCMGC and the secretaries of the departments to which
the GCs are attached will agree with each CC on a set of targets for
the year, which will then become the basis for the evaluation of
performance and results. The financial viability of the targets would
be verified by the corporate planning model, which would also
routinely provide a selective list of monitoring indicators and target
numerical values to allow assessment of the performance of each
corporation. The number of targets (as opposed to indicators, which
are monitored to identify potential problems) will be limited, so as
to give clear signals to management.   In the case of GCs that are
expected to meet social goals, the monitoring and evaluation system



- 28 -
will be designed so as to take into account the constraints on
financial performance imposed by such public policy expectations. The
monitoring system intends to measure performance in three main areas:
(a) the achievement of corporate goals in terms of service
objectives (population served, coverage and reliability of
services);
(b) the efficiency of corporate management and resource
utilization (number of employees per unit of output,
collection efficiency, etc.); and
(c) the financial performance of the corporation (rates of
return, internal cash generation, liquidity and operating
ratios, etc.).
3.34       A Performance Evaluation System (PES) will be designed with
a weighting system for the above-mentioned factors and a methodology
for the evaluation and rating of GCs.  The PES would be introduced
gradually, starting with the five pilot GCs mentioned earlier (para.
3.29).   Monitoring of GCs has already been started by CAG.  The
introduction of the PES for 15 large GCs would be a condition for
release of the third tranche of the proposed loan.
3.35      Incentive Mechanisms.  To be fully successful, the PES has
to be linked to a system of incentives.   Such systems, which may
include substantial bonuses for staff showing outstanding performance,
have proven successful in several countries, including Pakistan and
Korea. The Government is now planning to develop and introduce a PES
suitable to the Philippines.   The design of an appropriate PES and
incentive system for GCs, which is included in the technical
assistance to GCMCC, is a condition for the release of the second Bank
loan tranche.
3.36         Accounting and Auditing ImRrovements.   Until recently,
accounting  for  GCs  was  not  standardized.    The  conventions,
presentation and some accounting methods were decided by each
corporation, making it difficult to compare results among GCs, and
complicating the audit and financial analysis  of CGs.   This
contributed to an uneven audit performance.   Moreover, while parent
corporations were audited by COA, most of the subsidiaries have until
recently not been subjected to any audit, and the financial results of
parent corporations were not consolidated with those of their
subsidiaries.
3.37       In 1987, COA substantially improved government accounting
standards by adopting the generally accepted accounting principles
established by the Philippines Accounting Standards Council.   These
standards, as enforced by COA, will ensure the comparability and
reliability of the GCs'  financial  statements.   The GCs have
independantly beer attempting to develop tneir own computerized
accounting svstems, but - zis has led to a duplication of efforts,
limited and incompatible systems,  as well as inadequate financial
statements.  DBM with the support of COA would introduce computerized



- 29 -
accounting systems for the major OCs using the tstandard chart of
accounts as a base. Consultant assistance would be required to design
such a system (para. 3.41).   The finalization of an implementation
plan, agreed with the Bank, to introduce computerized accounting for
GCs would be a condition for release of the second tranche of the
proposed loan.   The introduction of computerized accounting in ten
large GCs would be a condition for release of the third tranche.
3.38       COA is responsible to provide adequate audits of all GCs.
Recently, it substantially improved its procedures for auditing GCs
through, among other things, the issuance of a revised Audit Manual in
1987, the adoption of accounting standards (para. 3.37), the
introduction of statistical sampling, and the establishment of Special
Audit Tenms to participate in the annual audits. The proposed reform
program is designed to further this process by upholding the financial
independence of COA. Until 1986, COA staff operated within, and were
paid by, GCs being audited. To guarantee financial independence for
COA, E.O. 19 (June 19, 1986) entablished that starting in 1987 audit
charges are paid to the Government by each GC, and that COA is
financed by the central government budget. To monitor these
improvements and as part of efforts to assess overall country progress
in this area, the Bank is planning to carry out annually an
implementation review of the audit results of all projects it assists
in the Philippines.
3.39      Differential Treatment.  To improve their performance, the
retained GCs will need adequate autonomy in matters relating to
personnel, compensation and procurement. This requires treatment of
corporations  different  from government departments.   A.O.  59
recommends that service-wide government agencies (i.e., NEDA, DBM,
DOF, etc.) would provide differential treatment to GCs relative to
government departments.  To provide for improved salary levels for
GCs, the Congress is already studying legislation prepared by DBM L5.
The CSC has been providing some flexibility in the application of
civil service regulations to GCs and has prepared draft legislation to
establi.sh a corporate career executive service, which provides for
adequate autonomy and standards of employment, incentives, and career
development for employees of GCs on the basis of comparable industry
practices. As a condition for the release of the second tranche of
the proposed loan, satisfactory progress would be achieved towards
establishing an appropriate corporate career executive service for
Gcs.
3.40       Satisfactory differential treatment is also being provided
for procurement by GCs. Until 1987, GCs could approve contracts worth
a few thousand pesos, but E.O. 164 (May 5, 1987) increased the
h5  While different pay scales (up to 2.5 times the government scale)
exist for the corporate sector, the present differentials are
considered inadequate for some  technical jobs.   A number of
corporations overcome this difficulty by selectively hiring their
staff on a contract basis. A special case is the Philippine National
Oil Company where virtually all staff are seconded from subsidiaries.



- 30 -
approval authority of CC boards of directors to P 50 million for bids
and P 5 million for negotiated contracts, and allowed department
Secretaries to delegate their approval powers (for contracts costing
up to P 100 million) to the boards of their attached GCs.   These
limits  are satisfactory for most GCs.  E.O. 164 also provides that
upon recommendation of NEDA, the President may revise the above-
mentioned ceilings.
V. Technical Assistance Program
3.41      Technical assistance (TA) is essential to support overall
implementation of the Reform Program, strengthen its institutional
framework and help to improve the performance of the retained
corporations. NEDA is coordinating TA for the program, which will be
financed through grants from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), USAID,
UNDP and OECF. The ERL also includes some US$500,000 that can be used
to finance any shortfall in the TA program. Agreement was reached at
negotiations on the Terms of Reference, cost, financing and
implementation schedule of the TA. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that the Government would timely implement and finance
the required TA. The qualification and experience of the consultants
will be agreed with the Bank.  The appointment of consultants is a
condition for release of the second Bank loan tranche, and release of
the third tranche would be conditional on the achievement of
satisfactory progress toward implemznting the TA.   The TA for the
program would include the following:
(a)  Privatization Program. The TA to be provided would assist
COP and DE in defining and changing the legal status of GCs,
besides providing assistance and financial support for the
valuation,  marketing,   evaluation and negotiation of GC
sales.   Much  of  this  assistance would be provided by
investment banking and financial experts to formulate
financial packages and contracts and provide assistance for
the sale of assets;
(b) ImRrovement of Retained CorDorations. This includes support
to GCMCC and GAG in monitoring the performance of the
retained corporations. Assistance would be required in such
areas as:  introduction of CORPLAN to 15 major GCs; design
and introduction of an appropriate performance evaluation
system; design of a related incentive system; and
establishment of an integrated information and reporting
system for the GCs and various government agencies.
Training of CAG and concerned GC staff would be an integral
part of this TA component;
(c) Disposition other than Privatization. The TA would support
DBK in implementing the program of consolidations, changes
of attachments and abolition of GCs, as well as affecting
necessary changes in the charters of GCs. A major component
of such assistance will be the preparation of legislation to
support the disposition actions and to support limited
privatization of some assets of retained GCs; and



-31-             -
(d)  Accounting ImRrovements.  TA would support DBM  in improving
the accounting of GCs by establishing a comaputerized
accounting system, based on the standard chart of accounts
approved by COA. This would result iu timely and accurate
accounting and provide compatible financial information for
all CCs.
Loan Administration
3.42        t_posed Loan.  The proposed Bank loan of US$200 million
equivalent would support the Government's Reform Program for GCs. The
project closing date would be August 31, 1991. Negotiations for the
proposed program were held in Washington between March 24 and 30,
1988, with the Government delegation led by Mr. Edgardo del Fonso,
Undersecretary, DOF.
3.43      Project Implementation.  Annex 8 presents a  chart showing
implementation responsibilities. DOF will be responsible for overall
coordination of the Reform Program.   It will also prepare progress
reports on overall project implementation for review by Bank missions
prior  to  release  of  each  loan  tranche.    Responsibility  for
implementation of the various program components would be as follows.
DBE will be responsible for implementation of the remaining
disposition actions under the rationalization program, namely,
abolitions, consolidations, conversions to nonprofit status and
changes in CC charters. DBN (with support from COA) will also be
responsible for improvements  in accounting and auditing.   The
privatization program will be managed by COP and implemented by APT
and other DEs. The program to improve the retained corporations will
be implemented by GCMCC, with technical support from CAG.  Finally,
the TA program will be coordinated by NEDA.
3.44      Disbursements.  The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan for
the Reform Program would be disbursed against general imports based on
a standard negative list which includes, inter alia, goods and
services for military or paramilitary purposes or for luxury
consumption.   Both private- and public-sector imports would be
eligible for financing. Statements of Expenditures would be used for
contracts below US$2,000,000 equivalent. To expedite disbursements, a
Special Account would be established in the Central Bank of the
Philippines (CBP) with an initial deposit of US$12 million. The Bank
would replenish this account on the basis of adequately supported
withdrawal applications. Retroactive financing for up to $30 million
would be used to reimburse eligible program expenditures incurred
after July 31, 1987. The proposed loan is expected to be disbursed
over a period of two and a half years.
3.45        Tranche Release Conditions.   Considerable progress has
already been achieved in project preparation, most notably, the
establishment of an improved legal framework for the public corporate
sector, the completion of all studies for the rationalization of the
sector, the approval of the disposition recommendations for most GCs,
the approval and establishment of adequate institutional mechanisms



- 32 -
for the program (i.e., COP, APT, GCMCC, and CAG), including their
staffing, budget, and operational guidelines, the approval of
privatization plans, the initiation of corporate planning, the
establishment of improved accounting and auditing standards and the
satisfactory implementation of the privatization program in 1987.
Based on these actions, the first loan tranche of US$75 million
equivalent would be available for disbursement upon loan
effectiveness.   The second tranche (US$75 million equivalent)  and
third tranche (US$50 million equivalent) would be released after the
timely completion of agreed actions described in the Development
Policy Letter and the Action Plan and set out ir. the draft Loan
Agreements.
3.46     SDecific conditions for the release of the second tranche of
the loan include:
(a) final approval of the disposition recommendations for all
GCs (para. 3.08);
(b) completion of all steps necessary to get in a vendible form
and offer for sale 30 GCs targeted for privatZzation and
representing in 1985 at least 20% of the gross value of the

(c) finalization of an implementation plan for the relevant
consolidation, regularization, conversion and abolition of
about 100 GCs, and satisfactory progress toward amending the
charters of these GCs (para. 3.21);
(d)  completion of a review of the charters of GCs,  and the
formulation of recommendations regarding membership of the
boards of the retained corporations (para. 3.24);
(e) finalization of an implementation plan to introduce
computerization of accounting systems for GCs (para. 3.37);
(f) approval of a corporate plan by the Board of Directors of
five GCs (para. 3.32);
(g) design of a performance evaluation and incentive system
(para. 3.35);
(h) appointment of adequate staff for GAG (para. 3.27);
(i) satisfactory progress towards amendments of charters of GCs
to incorporate the principles in para. 7 of the Letter of
Development Policy (para. 3.23);
(j) issuance of regulations on subsidies and loan guarantees for
GCs (para. 3.23);
(k) satisfactory progress towards establishing a corporate
career executive service (para. 3.39); and



- 33 -
(1) appointment of consultants with qualifications, experience
and terms of reference agreed with the Bank for the TA
(para. 3.41).
3.47       Specific conditions for the release of the third tranche
include:
(a) completion of all steps necessary to get in vendible form
and offer for sale an additional 30 of the GCs targeted for
privatization, with the cumulative total of 60 representing
in 1985 at least 50% of the gross value of the assets to be
privatized of GCs (para. 3.20);
(b) finalization of an implementation plan for the relevant
consolidation, regularization, conversion and abolition of
the remaining GCs (para. 3.21);

(g)  introduction of a computerized accounting   system for ten
large GCs (para. 3.37);
(h)  introduction of  a  performance  evaluation  system for 15
large GCs (para. 3.34); and
(i) satisfactory progress in the implementation of the TA (para.
3.41).
3.48       Procurement.  Both private and public sector imports would
be eligible for financing. Procurement will be through international
competitive bidding (ICB) but with two exceptions: (a) procurement of
commonly traded commodities can be undertaken through organized
international commodity markets or other channels of competitive
procurement acceptable to the Bank, in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Bank; and (b) contracts for goods estimated to cost
less than US$5 million each may be awarded on the basis of normal
procurement procedures of the purchasers of such goods acceptable to
the Bank.
3.49     Audits and Accounts.  The DOF will maintain financial records



- 34 -
of all public sector imports under the program in accordance with
sound accounting practices. Agreement was reached during negotiations
that within six months after the end of each year DOF would furnish to
the Bank an audit report detailing the imports financed under the
loan, the Statements of Expenditures and the Special Account, as
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
Social Impact. Benefits and Risks
3.50       The proposed   program,  in the short term,  is likely to
increase unemployment.   While  it is difficult at  this  stage  to
quantify the number of public sector jobs that may be lost, it is
inevitable that a program that includes privatization, consolidations
and abolition of enterprises will lead to layoffs. Recognizing this,
especially in light of its successful experience with reform of the
DBP and the Philippine National Bank (PNB), the Government is
addressing the issue through the provision of special measures like
high severance payments and early retirement plans, and, when
applicable, with retraining programs to reduce the adverse financial
impact on those affected.    Because of these measures most of the
privatization actions in 1987 have been implemented without
significant problems or delays. These aspects are a main consideration
irn the DE evaluation of the corporation and the negotiations with
potential buyers of GCs to be privatized. These measures and the
phased implementation of the reform program over the next five years
will lessen the adverse impact of these required changes. It is also
expected that private ownership of most of the industrial corporations
will have a significant 4rpact in making these corporations more
competitive and efficient, resulting in higher growth rates which
would improve the economy and the employment at large.
3.51     The proposed Reform Program would benefit the Philippines by
restructuring, strengthening and making its GCs more efficient.   Its
immediate benefits would appear in the budget, through the reduction
of government grants and contributions resulting from the reduction in
size and scope of government activity in the corporate sector, and the
cash flows proceeding from the sales of assets of GCs. Longer-term
benefits include better allocation and utilization of investment
funds, and improved productivity and cost recovery. The establishment
of corporate planning as well as a system for performance monitoring
and accountability would foster an increase in efficiency and
effectiveness of the GCs, improve the provision of public services, in
particular to the low-income population, promote better evaluation of
capital expenditures and improve macroeconomic planning. Moreover, in
so far as the privatization program would lead to public share issues
over the next five years, there will be an ir.*-rease in the supply of
new equity securities which will contribute to the development of the
domestic capital market.   Given the size of the corporations, their
importance in the economy, and their direct influence on the lives of
the majority of the population, the improvements initiated through the
Reform Program would contribute significantly to the economic growth
and prosperity of the Philippines.
3.52     The proposed reform program introduces significant changes in



- 35 -
the composition, organization, coordination, financing and management
of GCs. Such changes are likely to be met with resistance from groups
and individuals benefiting from the status quo. The privatization and
reorganization of GCs would affect the labor force, thus initially
creating adverse reactions.    Such  internal  pressures  could slow
implementation and/or reduce the effectiveness of some parts of the
program. Although the matn legal framework for the sector is already
in place, some legislative action is still required, whose approval
may delay setting in place the completed framework envisioned by the
Government. To address these problems, and mitigate their possible
adverse impact, the Government is educating the public on the need for
the reforms, is planning for a phased implementation, and has
introduced other compensatory measures such as early retirement
packages and special severance payments.   The above mentioned risks
are also mitigated by the country consensus on the need to reform the
government corporate sector, and the fact some of the most difficult
steps (the approval of the main legal framework, the establishment and
staffing of the required mechanisms, the required studies and
rationalization, the decisions on the disposition of the government
corporations, etc.) have been achieved before Board presentation.
PART IV - WORLD BANt OPERATIONS
4.01      As of March 31, 1988, the Philippines had received 102 Bank
loans (of which two were on Third Window terms) amounting to US$4,169
million and six IDA credits amounting to US$107 million.   IFG gross
investments as of January 31, 1988 totalled US$99.4 million and
investments hold by IFC (outstanding) totalled US$66.4 million.   The
share of the Bank Group in total medium- and long-term debt disbursed
and outstanding is currently about 13%, and its share in total debt
service is about 18%. These ratios are expected to be about 15% and
12%, respectively, by 1990.   Annex 2 contains a summary of IDA
credits, Bank loans, and IFC investments as of March 31, 1988.
4.02        Bank Group lending to the Philippines expanded from an
average of about US$90 million and four loans per year in FY71-75 to
an average of about US$420 million and seven loans in FY80-84.
However, the lending program decreased dramatically in FY85 and FY86
because of the limited scope for traditior.al project lending under the
economic circusmstances then prevailing.  Only two loans were made in
FY86 for a total of US$151 million. Although the lending program was
reduced in size during the stabilization period (1983-1986), the
emphasis of the program ensured that greater weight was assigned to
alleviate the adverse socioeconomic impact of the economic
stabilization program.    In FY87, the lending program consisted of
three loans totaling US$342 million; the bulk of this was accounted
for by the Economic Recovery Loan which provided quick-disbursing
assistance in support of a program of structural reforms.   These
reforms focus on the public investment program, the financial
institutions, the trade regime and the tax system. Other loans were
to support an Economic Recovery Technical Assistance Project and a



- 36 -
Provincial Ports Project.
4.03       The Bank has financed projects in virtually all sectors of
the economy, with particular emphasis on agriculture which has
accounted for almost one third of total Bank/IDA lending. Lending for
industry, transportation, energy and social sactors followed in
descending order.   In agriculture,  lending  i-litially  focused on
expanding the irrigation system, credit programs, and other services
to support rice production. The experience with irrigation has been
positive with the establishment of a strong institution (the National
Irrigation Administration) and increase in irrigated area, although
cost recovery is still a problem.   Efforts have also been made to
diversify agricultural production through loans for tree crops,
livestock, fisheries, and integrated rural development projects.  In
FY85, the Bank provided assistance under the Agricultural
Sector/Inputs Project to support programs of policy and institutional
reforms, and the Agricultural Credit Project to provide credit to
agricultural producers and to help establish a framework for a
financially sound rural credit system.
4.04       In the industrial and financial sectors,  lending has
supported policy reforms under the Government's structural adjustment
program. Structural adjustment lending in 1980 and 1983 (US$502.3
million total), supported a series of reforms of the tariff structure,
the system of industrial incentives, energy pricing and export
promotion.   An Industrial Finance Loan approved in FY81 supported
improvements in financial sector policies, including liberalizing
interest rates, reducing bank specialization and increasing the
availability of longer-term funds.   It also  introduced a new
institutional concept to broaden the reach of Bank lending by
channeling loans through an "apex' unit in the Central Bank.   In
addition, the Bank has continued to provide financial support and
technical assistance to small and medium industries.
4.05       In infrastructure,  the Bank has  supported a number of
transportation projects (five highway projects, two rural roads
projects, three ports projects and one shipping project). Tne Bank's
role has been to assist the Government in the implementation of its
program in the sector, with special emphasis on institutional issues
and strengthening maintenance capabilities and rural development. The
Second Rural Roads Improvement Project (FY86) was designed to
alleviate poverty in rural areas by providing farmers easy access to
markets  and  social  infrastructure.    To  mitigate  the  social
consequences of the stabilization program, Bank-supported projects in
water, urban and regional development emphasized improvement of basic
social services.  Future objectives would be to continue to provide
assistance to the sector institutions with which the Bank deals,
assist them to formulate sector priorities and investment programs,
and implement appropriate sector policies.
4.06      In the goverment  corporate  sector,    Bank lending has
supported measures to improve the operational and financial
performance of public enterprises.  The MWSS has received financing
under the Metropolitan Manila Water Distribution Project to



- 37 -
computerize its billing and collection operations to be able to handle
rapidly increasing connections and reduce its arrears.   The ongoing
Communal Irrigation Development Project includes financing of a study
to establish an integrated financial management and reporting system
at the National Irrigation Administration to improve control over
disbursements and collection operations.   The Rural Electrification
Project has financed the establishment of a planning unit at the
National Electrification Administration to help rural cooperatives
prepare short- and medium-term supply and demand estimates and orient
their operations accordingly. For the NPC, the Seventh Power Project
has financed a training center to upgrade the technical and
managerial/supervisory capacities of its rapidly expanding staff.
Under the Provincial Ports Project, agreement was reached with the
Government to authorize the PPA to operate as an autonomous
corporation with full control over its resources; this will enable the
PPA to maintain and rehabilitate its infrastructure and equipment in a
timely manner. In connection with the proposed Housing Sector Reform
operation, the Government has enacted legislptLon to rationalize
sector institutions and financing, including, jinter alia, divestiture
of the subsidiaries of the Human Settlements Development Corporation,
limiting the functions of the NHA to low-ccst shelter production, and
establishing a housing council to coordinate sector activities.
4.07      The  FY88-89 lending strategy for the Philippines emphasizes
operations that would address essential macroeconomic and sectoral
policy reforms, rehabilitation and maintenance of existing
infrastructure, and priority activities that would minimize the need
for budgetary support.   The framework for macroeconomic reform has
been provided under the ERL which is supporting Government efforts to
develop and implement appropriate policies for tax reform, trade
liberalization, and rationalization of government financial
institutions, and to restructure the public investment program.  At
the sectoral level, in addition to this proposed loan for reform of
GCs, a Housing Sector Reform operation is being processed as mentioned
in the preceding paragraph.   It would address  institutional and
financial policy reforms to reduce reliance of the sector on
Government support.   Other proposed operations include a loan for
irrigation operations to help define a realistic program  for
rehabilitation and maintenance of the irrigation system; a project for
further development of geothermal power generation; a loan in support
of small and medium scale industry; and a project for the development
of health care, with particular emphasis on high impact programs.

PART V - RECOMNENDATION
5.01      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

1.         This letter is to request a policy-based loan to support  a
program  of  reforms for the government  corporate  sector,  described
below (the Program), and provide us with required financial assistance.
2.         The  rapid growth of the governmant corporate  sector,  its
contribution to the public sector deficit and its share in the
external debt burden have become matters of serious concern to the
Government. In the past, there was an excessive prolilferation of non-
financial government-owned or controlled corporations (GCs), without a
clear  delineation  of  the  grounds  for  government  activities   in
corporate form and without adequate monitoring and supervision of GCs,
resulting in a significant drain of public resources as well as the
progressive discouragement of private initiative on account of undue
government competition.
3.        To deal with this serious problem and establish  appropriate
conditions to accelerate economic recovery and foster sustained
economic growth, the Government accords the highest priority to the
implementation of necessary changes in its organizational and func-
tional structures. This will promote and control economy, efficiency
and  effectiveness  in  the delivery of public services.   It  is  our
policy to encourage the role of the private sector as the primary
instrument for undertaking most economic activities as well as our
intention to reduce, limit and rationalize government activities using
the corporate form. Consequently, the Government has adopted a series
of measures to (i) clearly define the criteria on the basis of which
the corporate form would be used by the Government; (il) dispose of
(including privatize) certain GCs which do not satisfy such criteria;
(iii) improve the efficiency as well as organizational-and financial
capabilities of GCs that do need to remain in the-portfolio of the
Government; and (iv-) set up an improved framework for macro-economic
financial and perfomance monitoring of GCs.
4.         In  the  following paragraphs we' set  out  recent  specific
actions taken by the Government to address the above issues, and the
additional steps that we will be taking to implement the Program.
5.       ' The  President issued on February 16,  1988  Administrative
Order (AO) 59, Rationalizing the Government Corporate Sector. This AO
is  the  generic instrument that sets out the  Executive  Department's
policy regarding the role and activities of GCs. It stipulates the



-48-                                       ANNEX 4
Page 2 of 5
criteria subject to which the Government would resort to the use of
the corporate form.
The corporate form will be used only:
(a)   in  areas  where  the goods and services are  vital  to  the
society and the private sector Is unwilling or unable to
provide the service or when there is a need to create a.blas
in favor of disadvantaged sectors of the society;
Cb)   if  it is more efficient, effective and economic than If  an
agency in a line department were used, and if jsing the
corporate form would limit the liability of the Government
to its direct equity exposure; or
(c)   if  it  can be financially :ndependent and  require  minimal
support from the aovernment (the GC should be able to
support its operations from its own internal cash generation
without  any  special  privilege  or  assistance  from   the
Government).
6.        AO 59 significantly tightens the procedures for the creation
of  new  GCs  (including subsidiaries) and  emphasizes  the  need  for
providing adequate operational flexibility to corporations as well as
requiring due accountability from them. It is aiF, consistent with
our policy that: (i) GCs would not be given regulatory functions or
authority; (ii) GCs would not enjoy special privileges or benefits;
(iii) GCs should operate under standardized organizational, managerial
and financial features under a set of uniform rules; (iv) liabilities
of the Government in respect to GCs w.ll be limited; (v) duplicative
functions of GCs would be eliminated; (vi) an effective system for the
supervision   of  GCs  would  be  established;  (vii)  a   performance
evaluation system (PES) would be established for GCs; and (viii) the
creation and acquisition of new GCs would be restricted.
7.         We have also adopted other laws and  regulations  necessary
for the implementation of the program which are listed in the
attachment  hereto.   We  support  the  legislation  which  has   been
introduced  recently  in  our  Congress  to  inter  alia  permit   the
establishment of salaries of GCs' staff in a more flexible manner
taking into account comparable industry practice. In addition and to
complement the main policies set forth in AO 59, we would also issue
administrative guidelines by June 30, 1989, in the areas mentioned
below, and in areas which are covered by existing legislation, the
Government will seek Congressional consideration of legislative action
to amend laws (including the Charters of GCs) as necessary for
consistency with the above mentioned policies, in particular to:



- 49                                    ANNEX 4
Page 3 of 5
(a)  ellminate   automatic   government  guarantees   for   ;oans
contracted by GCs;
Cb)   standardize  the  general features of charters  of  GCs  and
tneir management, as follows: (1) vesting the management of
GCs in the Chief Executive Officer under the direction of
the Board of Directors; (ii) requiring that members of the
Board of Directors should have recognized :omoetence and
experience   relevant   to   the   GCs'  operations;   (tii)
clarifying the role of service-wide departments (National
Economic and Development Authority (NEDA), Civil Service
Commission (CSC), Department of Finance (DOF), Department of
Budget and Management (DCM) and the Commission on Audit
(COA) regarding GCs; and (iv) that when GCs are required by
Government to undertake activities which are not financially
viable, the Government will take adequate and timely steps
to protect the financial viability of such GCs, on the basis
of arrangements between the Government and the GCs as part
of inter-departmental monitoring and evaluation by the
GCMCC; and
(c)   introduce   an    appropriate  corporate  career   executive
service for GCs.
8.          The Government intends to undertake by January 31, 1989  a
review of the charters of GCs and thereafter take necessary action to
ensure that: (a) where the Chairman of a GC is the representative of
the Department to which that GC is attached, arrangements for inter-
departmental monitoring and evaluation by the GCMCC are appropriately
adjusted as necessary to take into account this fact; and that the
other responsibilities of such representative are consistent with the
need that the representative devote adequate time and attention in the
discharge of his/her responsibilities as Chairman; and (b) where ex-
officio members constitute the majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of a GC, the selectikn of the Departments represented on the
Board in each case adequately takes into account the relevance of the
functions of such Departments to the activities of the GC.
9.          The   Government's  proposed  actions  for   the   further
implementation of the Program are summarized below.
I.        Decisions Regarding GCs Lo be Divested/Retained
10.         On   the  basis  of  the  criteria  set  out  in  AC   59
(Rationalization AO), we rated each of the 296 GCs currently in our
portfolio and have made recommendations regarding the action to be
taken with respect to each GC.   Our present recommendations for these
GCs are to retain 37 GCs and merge with them another 16 GCs, abolish
67 GCs which can not be transferred to the private sector, divest 132
GCs to the private sector, convert to non-profit private corporations
8  GCs, and regularize as part of departments another 36  GCs.   Final
decisions for 194 GCs have been completed. Decisions regarding a
further 36 GCs will be communicated to the Bank shortly. The
Government is further reviewing the disposition for the remaining 66
GCs, and a final-decision for these GCs is expected not later than



-50-                                    ANNEX 4
Page 4 of 5
December 31, 1988. The number of GCs in each category would be
adjusted in accordance with final approval regarding disposition.
II.       Divestment of GCs
11.       In accordance with provisions of Proclamations 50 and  50-A,
the Committee on Privatization has been actively analyzing and
monitoring  the  overall  privatization  program,  and  has   approved
Guidelines to be used by all Disposition Entities (DE) responsible for
the  divestment  of  GCs.  The Asset  Privatization  Trust  (A?T),  is
entrusted  with  the task of divestment of  about  400  Non-Perf2rming
Accounts  (NPAs) of Government Financial Institutions as well  as  the
assets of many GCs to be privatized. To accelerate the privatization
process we have also designated some of the parent corporations
(mainly the Philippine National Oil Company, the National Development
Company and the Department of Agriculture) to act as disposition
entities, and COP has already approved detailed privatization plans
for most of the GCs already approved for privatization. Total sales
of NPAs and GCs already reached P 8.1 billion in 1987. The Government
plans to complete the disposition of the assets to be privatized by
December 31, 1991.
III.       Rationalization of Retained GCs
12.        As stated in paragraph 10  above, it is presently  proposed
that  about 37 GCs will be retained in the government portfolio.   The
Government plans to introduce a series of measures to enhance the
efficiency, effectiveness and public accountability of these GCs.   To
this end, AO 59 provides that GCs should be given adequate operational
flexibility and differential treatment by service-wide agencies and
provides basic rules for the Departmental supervision of attached GCs,
sets the authority of the Secretary, the Board of Directors and the
Chief Executive Officer. EO 236 of July 22, 1987 and AO 59 set the
responsibility for inter-departmental monitoring and evaluation in
the   Government  Corporate  Monitoring  and  Coordinating   Committee
(GCMCC).   We  have  also  issued  EO  164  (May  5,  1987)  providing
additional flexibility to procurement by GCs. These measures and the
additional legislation (para. 7) are intended to provide for the
effective supervision and monitoring of retained GCs as well as the
establishment of revised regulations governing the terms of employment
of employees of retained GCs. Some of these aspects are further
discussed below.
13.       EO 236 and GCMCC Guidelines (January 22, 1988) establish  an
inter-departmental   monitoring  and  evaluation  of  all   GCs.    In
particular GCMCC will: (i) promote and implement improved corporate
planning and long-term financial projections, which are currently
being implemented in five of the largest GCs, and that will be
expanded  to  15  of  the  largest GCs  in  1990.   (ii)  establish  a
performance evaluation system for GCs, which will be designed by July
31, 1989, and implemented in 15 of the largest GCs during 1990; and
review and streamline reporting and management information systems
for GCs, to avoid duplication. We are also implementing a program for
strengthening the supervisory capabilities of departments to which GCs
are attached. Steps have been taken by the Commission on Audit (COA)



- 51 -                                 ANNEX 4
Page 5 of 5
to further strengthen its auditing of GCs, through application of a
revised audit manual and the approval of standardized accounting
regulations. Tan of the largest GCs, with support from DBM will also
implement by June 30, 1990 improved computerized accounting systems.
This  would  provide  uniformly  applied  accounting  procedures   and
compatible and adequate financial statements which could be used for
the management and monitoring of GCs.
14.        To support these programs we have identified the  following
four main areas where technical assistance is required: (i) corporate
planning and performance evaluation; (ii) privatization of GCs; (iii)
assistance   for   non-privatization   dispositions   (regularization,
conversions,   abolition,   etc.)  and  (iv)   implementation   and/or
improvement of computerized accounting. The Government has been
discussing financing of these components with several donors and will
provide financial support as needed in order to complete the project
technical assistance. Although some research studies may continue for
a longer period, the technical assistance related to the project is
expected to be completed not later than December 31, 1991.
15.    We  believe  that this program of reforms will be  instrumental
in achieving the policy objectives described above. We would like,
therefore, to request the Bank a loan in the amount of US $200 million
in support of the Program.
Sincerely,
Vicent   . Jayme       Guillermo N. Carague    -Golita Collas-Monsod

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
1.        Introduction.  The Technical Assistance (TA) is an essential
part of the Reform Program of Public Corporations and the Government
is committed to complete key elements of this program as indicated in
the Action Plan. Technical assistance grants are being negotiated with
several donors to facilitate the implementation of the TA, and such
grants would be complemented by local funding, as needed, to complete
the four main tasks described below. Terms of Reference, available in
rhe Project File, have been agreed between the Government and the
Bank. NEDA will be responsible for the overall coordination of the
TA, but each particular component will be implemented by the
respective agencies.
2.         Components of the TA.  The TA includes four components as
follows: (A) Privatization of State Enterprises; (B) Corporate
Planning  and  Performance  Evaluation;  (C)    Non-Privatization
Disposition and (D) Computerized Accounting.   The objectives, main
tasks, implementation agencies, forecasted cost, timetable and status
of funding for each of these components are described below.
(A) Privatization of State Enterprises.
3.          Objectives and Main Tasks. The purpose of this TA is to
assist the Government with divestiture of government corporations (GC)
and acquired assets in order to reduce their budgetary burden and
improve the country's economic efficiency. The implementation of this
component would be by the Disposition Entities (DE), which include the
Asset Privatization Trust (APT), some parent corporations and some
parent Departments. The main tasks for this TA are:
(a) review the portfolio of GCs to be privatized, assess
priorities for disposition, review specific issues associated
with each GC and update as needed the Privatization Plans
required by Committee on Privatization (COP);
(b) provide legal services to identify and resolv2 legal issues
precedent to offering GCs for sale and to execute actual
sales;
(c) provide financial advice for the valuation and marketing of
GCs. Prepare prospectus, identify investors, evaluate
proposals, provide advice to the DE for the negotiations with
potential buyers and assess specific purchase proposals;
(d) provide support to COP on policy studies on related topics
such  as  rehabilitation  versus  liquidation,  financing
strategies, etc.; and
(e) provide computer hardware to support information and data
management for the overall privatization program.

4.          Cost and Financing The total cost of this component is
estimated at US$9.7 million, of which US$3.7 mil:ion (38%) is the
estimated foreign component. Negotiations are underway between the
Government and USAID, to provide grant-financing for US$5.0 million.
The remaining funds would be provided by the Government.
B. Corporate Planning and Performance Evaluation System
5.          Obiectives and Kain Tasks The purpose of this TA is to
support improved corporate and long-term financial planning in 15 of
the   largest non-financial GCs,  and to provide assistance  in
establishing a national system for monitoring and evaluating the
performance of retained GCs.  The implementation of this component
will be by the Government Corporate Monitoring   and Coordinating
Committee (GCMCC), and its technical secretariat, the Corporate
Affairs Group (CAG). The main tasks are:
(a) review the corporate planning model (CORPLAN) and assist in
its adoption by 15 of the largest non-financial GCs;
(b; review the existing monitoring system and reporting
requirements, and recommend information to be collected to
avoid duplication of paperwork, to improve accurrcy and to
facilitate the implementation of the corporate monitoring
system;
(c) recommend monitoring indicators and targets that could be
used for the evaluation of GCs, and propose a system that
would allow rating the corporations relative to their
specific objectives, the efficienev and effectiveness of
management and financial performance.   This system will be
tested first in five large GCs and introduced later in
another 10 GCs;
(d) recommend an incentive system, including bonuses for
employees and sanctions for GCs which achieve unsatisfactory
performance; and
(e) develop related manuals and training programs.
6.          Cost and Financing The total cost of chis component is
estimated at US$0.5 million, with a foreign component of US$0.37
million (74%). Agreement, in principle, has been reached with ADB to
provide grant-financing for US$0.47 million, with the remaining costs
being financed by Government.

C. Non-privatization Disposition
6.          Oblectives and Majn Tasks. The purpose of this TA is to
provide assistance to the Department of Budget and Management (DBM)
for the implementation of the disposition (othe. than privatization of
an entire corporate entity)  of GCs.   This component will be
implemented by DBM, with the support of the parent corporation or the
department responsible for the GCs to be abolished, regularized,
converted to non-profit corporations or consolidated with other GCB.
The main tasks for this component are:
(a) evaluate the requirements to dispose of the GCs and prepare
an action plan and implementation schedule;
(b) prepare required changes in legislation as may be necessary
for the disposal of each CC;
(c) provide support to DBM for the overall disposition actions
required;
(d) assist in the disposition of non-corporate assets and
minority holdings in private companies held by GCs; and
(e)  assist DBM in the preparation of legislation for retained
corporations in the areas of operating policy, personnel and
procurement.
7.          Cost and Financing The total cost of this component is
estimated irn US$1.0 million.   UNDP has agreed,  in principle,  to
provide up to US$0.5 for this TA. Funds not financed by such grants
would be provided by the Government.
D. Accounting
8.        Objectives and Main Tasks. The purpose of this component is
to implement a computerized system, which could be applied to the
general accounting of all non-financial GCs, and would be based on an
standard chart of accounts already approved by the Commission on Audit
(COA). This system would be applied to 10 of the largest GCs.  This
component will be implemented by DBE in collaboration with the
respective GCs.  This TA will be conducted in two phases with the
detailed terms of reference for Phase II being based on the
recommendations of Phase I. The main tasks (Phase I (a) through (d)
and Phase II (e) are:
(a) establish a standard system for presenting the financial
statements of GCs, which would provide sufficient flexibility
to identify their different revenues, expenses, while
retaining sindlar presentation and accounting approaches;



7-ANNEX  12-Page 4
(b)  evaluate the current computer systems for general ledger,
payroll, inventories, etc., and recommend expansion and
improvements that could be used by all GCs;
(c)  prepare a detailed plan for computerizing or improving the
existing accounting systems of ten CCs;
(d)  determine  the  software  and hardware  needed,  and  the
possibili-ty to implement the accounting system using micro or
minicomputers; and
(e)  evaluate and design software, select and evaluate hardware,
and install and test systems.
9.          Cost and Financing.  The total cost of Phase I of this
component is estimated in US$0.35 million, with a foreign component of
about 86%.  Agreement in principle has been received from the Japan
Grant Facility (IBRD-administered) for US$300,000 equivalent for this
purpose. Additional donor support for Phase II will be sought once the
detailed TOR are available. The. Government and the CCs will finance
the cost not financed by donors.
