TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
LOAN 3189-ME
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Transmission and Distribution
Project in Mexico, for which Loan 3189-ME in the amount of $450 million equivalent was
approved on April 17, 1990 and made effective on November 28, 1990.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1994, one year after the original closing date. It was fully
disbursed, and the last disbursement took place on May 22, 1995. Cofinancing for the project was
provided by the Interamerican Development Bank.
The ICR was prepared by Manuel I. Dussan, a consultant, and reviewed by Luis Cosenza, Task
Manager and Martin Staab, Division Chief (LA2IN). The borrower and cofinanciers provided
comments that are included as appendices to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during September, 1995 with a mission of the consultant to
Mexico. It is based on material in the project file and on information provided by the borrower to
the consultant during his mission to Mexico.  The borrower contributed to preparation of this
ICR by submitting a Final Progress Report on the project with an evaluation of the project's
execution.

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
LOAN 3189-ME
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Bank participated actively in financing power sector projects in Mexico until 1974,
when the Eleventh Power Project was completed. Thereafter, discussions with the Government
took place to resume lending operations, but this was not possible as important financial and
procurement issues remained unsolved. In 1986, the Government and CFE signed a Financial
Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA) that included a plan for the capitalization of CFE, a tariff
adjustment program and a program to improve CFE's operational performance. These actions
facilitated a policy dialogue and led the Government to request financial assistance from the Bank
for the Hydroelectric Development Project (loan 3083-ME, approved in June, 1989) and for the
Transmission and Distribution Project (loan 3189-ME).
Project Objectives
2.    The Transmission and Distribution Project was defined as a two year (1991-1992) time
slice (about $7000 million) of CFE's ten-year investment program for generation, transmission,
distribution, equipment upgrading and general plant. CFE identified high priority works within
this time slice and prepared special programs for Bank financing. The $450 million Bank loan
financed four basic components: (a) a special transmission program for the expansion and
improvement of transmission networks; (b) a special distribution program; (c) a thermal power
plants rehabilitation program; and (c) environmental studies.
3.    The stated objectives of the project were to improve performance  of thermoelectric
power plants, to correct distortions in electricity tariffs, to strengthen CFE's internal capabilities
to address the environmental impact of power projects, support improvements of CFE's
operations, and help fund CFE's transmission and distribution program for 1991-92.
4.    To promote achievement of project objectives the loan included covenants aimed to: (i)
modify the electricity tariff structure by 1992 to reflect economic costs, (ii) increase average
electricity tariffs by 30% in real terms over a four year period; (iii) increase the rate of return on
net fixed assets from 4% to 7% in four years; (iv) prepare and implement studies on
environmental impact of transmission lines and thermoelectric plants, and (v) implement
recommendations of previously prepared studies on CFE organization, operation and maintenance
procedures and electricity tariffs.
iii



5.    The project objectives addressed the main issues identified during the appraisal mission
that affected the electric power sector, namely: (i) inadequate maintenance of existing thermal
power plants that reduced their availability and efficiency; (ii) large pricing distortions, with
average tariffs representing in 1988 just 76% of long-run marginal costs; (iii) substantial subsidies
for residential tariffs, and a tariff structure for industrial consumers that was not cost-reflective;
(iv) a weak financial position; (v) excessive centralized control of operations; and (vi) an
investment lag in transmission and distribution that had reduced reliability and quality of service.
Implementation Experience and Results
6.    In spite of shortfalls on implementing the tariff adjustment program, the project achieved
most of its objectives and the likelihood of project sustainability is high:
a) Tariff adjustments during the period 1990-1995 fell short of expectations. Although major
tariff increases were implemented in 1991 and 1992 according to a program agreed with the
Government (tariffs were increased on average by 23% in real terms in two years), this effort
was lost during 1993 and 1994 due to reductions in tariffs to large industrial consumers and
the devaluation of late 1994. By 1995, real tariffs returned, on average, to about the same
level as 1990.
b) Targets set for improving the availability and efficiency of thermal plants were met: the
rehabilitation program was expanded from 38 to 82 generation units; availability was
increased by about 720 Mw as compared to a target of 678 Mw; recuperation of de-rated
capacity fell short of expectations (190 Mw vs. 418 Mw); and thermal efficiency was
increased in about 900 kcal/kwh, compared to a target of about 1,250 kcal/kwh.
c) In\vestments in transmission and distribution in 1991 and 1992 increased substantially over the
depressed values of previous years. However, in 1993 and 1994 they were reduced again due
to the application of investment ceilings by the Ministry of Finance and to a demand increase
that reached only about 60% of the forecast demand prepared in 1989.
d) CFE implemented the recommendations of environmental control studies in thermal plants,
with the following actions: (i) establishing a network to monitor emissions, a program to use
cleaner fuels in critical areas, and a control of effluents program, and (ii) replacing combustion
and fuel handling equipment in several thermal generation plants.
e) In general, CFE met most of the operational performance targets established in the FRA.
f) CFE is planning to decentralize operations and implement a new salary and incentive plan
based on productivity gains. In this regard, CFE is in the process of establishing a holding
company structure with separate generation, transmission and distribution business centers.
CFE has already established a new cost accounting system that keeps separate accounts for
each business unit and measures productivity gains.
7.    Most of the project's physical targets were achieved in a four year period instead of the
originally planned two-year time slice, due to delays in procurement caused mainly by budgetary
constraints imposed by the Government. In 1993, US$$125.5 million of loan uncommitted funds
that could not be utilized for the transmission component were allocated to supplement financing
of the civil works of the Zimapan Hydroelectric Project (financed under loan 3083-ME).
iv



8.    Project implementation was affected mainly by (i) budgetary constraints imposed by the
government to CFE, and (ii) time-consuming procurement procedures. Budgetary constraints
imposed annually by the government to meet macroeconomics targets delayed the
implementation of transmission and distribution works. The Bank's procurement procedures
adopted under the loan proved, in general, to be time-consuming and it took CFE much longer to
procure goods under the Bank's guidelines than under its own internal procedures.
9.    The Bank's performance was satisfactory. Bank staff had to assist GOM in defining and
preparing a new loan for a borrower that did not have any recent experience with Bank operations
(the previous loan to the power sector had been completed in 1974). Bank's missions supervised
project execution twice a year, which is adequate for a project that did not experience major
execution problems.
10.   The borrower's performance was satisfactory in spite of problems related to budget
ceilings, procurement and tariffs. CFE established an implementation unit, presented progress
reports on time, submitted to the Bank information and reports as indicated in the loan agreement
and implemented the project diligently considering the external constraints imposed on this
institution. The Government made major advances in improving CFE's financial situation and
performance by implementing the FRA, capitalizing CFE's debt and authorizing tariff increases
during the initial years of program.
Summary of findings, future operation and key lessons learned.
11.   It is likely that the achievement of most of the project objectives, which included
improvements of thermoelectric power plants, strengthening of CFE's capabilities to address
environmental issues, improvement of CFE's operational performance and supporting investments
in transmission and distribution, will prove to be sustainable. A reform for greater competition and
efficiency is taking place in the power sector and CFE is decentralizing its operations in order to
achieve greater autonomy and accountability for its business units. These changes are conducive
to sustaining the results of the project.  On environmental issues, a law issued in 1988,
complemented by norms and regulations, established a framework to tighten emission regulations
for thermal plants to comply in the medium term with international regulations.
12.   There are four main lessons learned from project execution. First, despite the fact that the
project was defined as a time-slice of the entire investment program, the Bank concentrated on
the specific works in the investment program which it financed. A more comprehensive review of
the entire investment program would have been justified and necessary. Second, the
implementation of the transmission program based on the award of separate contracts for
construction services and for supply of equipment and materials did not work well under the
budgetary constraints imposed on CFE: project execution was delayed and loan funds could not
be used efficiently. Probably, the use of turn-key arrangements would have been justified. Third,
ICB proved its worth.  In spite of some delays with time-consuming ICB procurement
procedures, the borrower acknowledged the benefits of lower prices, better quality and
improvements of the local industry. Fourth, it is difficult for the Government to comply with
long-term sector policies in a sector dominated by state-owned enterprises operating under a
weak regulatory framework. For example, in spite of a good start in implementing a tariff
v



adjustment program during 1991-1992, most of real increases in tariffs were lost in a one-year
period due to tariff measures prompted by political considerations. Most likely, the Government
would have faced difficulties in reversing sector policy, had the sector operated under an
independent regulatory framework with strong participation of private utilities.

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
LOAN 3189-ME
PART I:  PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
Project Objectives
1.    The Transmission and Distribution Project was defined as a two year (1991-1992) time
slice of CFE's ten-year investment program, with a total cost of about US$7,000 million. for
generation, transmission, distribution, rehabilitation and general plant.  CFE identified high
priority works of the time slice and prepared special programs for Bank- financing. The US$450
million Bank loan financed four basic components: (a) a special program for the expansion and
improvement of transmission networks above 115 kV (US$180 million); (b) a special distribution
program (US$155.0 million); (c) rehabilitation of thermoelectric power plants (US$1 13.5); and
(d) environmental control studies (US$1.50 million).
2.    The project objectives were:
a) To promote improvements and renovation of thermoelectric power plants to reduce the
investment requirements of the sector
b) Correct distortions in the tariff structure, reducing cross-subsidies among consumers to
improve end-use efficiency.
c) strengthen CFE's internal capabilities to address environmental issues related to the operation
of thermoelectric power plants and to the construction of transmission lines
d) farther pursue the improvement goals agreed under the Hydroelectric Development Project
on management, technical, financial and energy conservation aspects.
e) fund CFE's transmission and distribution program for 1991-92 with the purpose of meeting
industrial and commercial demand and expanding residential coverage, while improving the
technical efficiency and reliability of electric service.
3.    The project objectives addressed the main issues related to the electric power sector that
were identified during the appraisal mission, namely: (i) inadequate maintenance of existing
thermal power plants that reduced their availability, efficiency and rated capacity and increased
the capacity reserve required to meet demand; (ii) large pricing distortions: average electricity
tariffs represented in 1988 just 76% of long-run marginal costs, substantial subsidies for
agricultural and residential tariffs, and a tariff structure for industrial consumers that was not cost-
reflective and did not provide an efficient price signal; (iii) a weak financial position; (iv) excessive
centralized control of operations; (v) deficiencies in the expansion planning and investments
decisions process; and (vi) an investment gap in transmission and distribution networks that had
deteriorated reliability and quality of service.



2
4.    In general terms, the project objectives were complemented with concrete and specific
performance targets and with a definition of investment programs and plans required to meet
these targets. CFE prepared a thermal power plant rehabilitation program for 38 out of a total of
150 thermal generation units, aimed to increase available capacity and thermal efficiency in about
15% l. CFE prepared a tariff adjustment program to align tariffs with costs in about 9 years,
supported by a long-run marginal cost study and the commitment of the Government to this
pricing policy. The Government and CFE signed a Financial Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA) to
complete a US$8.6 billion capitalization program for CFE, increase average tariffs, improve
internal generation of funds, and improve CFE's operational performance. Finally, CFE prepared
special transmission and distribution investment programs aimed to close the investment gap and
strengthen the transmission and distribution grids.
5.    The project objectives, as planned, were important for the Government's strategy for the
power sector as they promote the efficient use of electricity and the financial strengthening of the
sector. The project also contributed to achieve the Bank objective? of improving least-cost
planning, reduce tariff subsidies, open up procurement to international competition, help CFE in
its institutional building efforts and improve the assessment of environmental impact of electric
power projects.
Achievement of Project Objectives
6.    The project accomplished its objectives substantially, except for the financial objectives
that were partially achieved (see table 5). The following paragraphs assess the achievements
regarding electricity tariffs, improvements in performance of thermal plants, and support to
investments in transmission and distribution.
7.    Tariff adjustments during the period 1990-1995 fell short of expectations. Although major
tariff increases were implemented in 1991 and 1992 according to a program agreed upon with the
Government (tariffs were increased on average by 23% in real terms in two years), during 1993
and 1994 this effort was lost. By 1995, real tariffs retumed, on average, to about the same level as
1990. The following table illustrates this point:
Year  Actual increase a/    Tar et       PPI
% p.a.   % b/    %    % b/   %
1990     5.4%      5.4%    9%   9.0%  22.7%

thermal efficiency from a range of 2615-3000 kcal/kwh to 2263-2606 kcal/kwh.



3
8.    Until 1992, tariffs for residential consumers, which represent a consumption of 25% of
total sales, were adjusted in real terms by about 50% with respect to 1989 in order to reduce large
subsidies in this category. On the other hand, tariffs for medium and high voltage industrial and
commercial consumers, which represent 55% of total sales, were kept constant in real terms as
they were above long-run marginal costs. However, during 1993 and 1994 residential tariffs were
kept constant in real terms, while high voltage tariffs were reduced about 20% in real terms as a
result of an adjustment of the tariff structure (to reflect economic costs) and a general reduction
of charges for large industries that faced a competitive market under new trade agreements with
the USA. Furthermore, during the severe economic crisis that Mexico faced in late 1994, the
Mexican currency was devalued by about 100% in a five-month period and the producer price
index increased by about 30%. This crisis deteriorated further the average tariff level in spite of a
20% increase in early 1995 for residential tariffs. As a result, residential tariffs, expressed as a
percentage of long-run marginal costs, decreased on average from about 80% in early 1994 to
50% in march, 1995 2 (see table 12).
9.    Most of the targets set for improving the availability and efficiency of thermal plants were
met. The thermal power plant renovation program comprised four groups of generation stations:
steam plants with 300 Mw, 150 Mw, and 75 Mw units and combined-cycle plants. The program
was expanded from 38 to 82 generation units. Availability was increased by about 720 Mw as
compared to a target of 678 Mw. Recuperation of de-rated capacity fell short of expectations
(190 Mw vs. 418 Mw), but it is expected to be completed by 1997. Thermal efficiency was
increased in about 900 kcal/kwh, compared to a target of about 1,250 kcalUkwh, due to the fact
that the target for the 75 Mw group was too ambitious.
10.   The results of the thermal plants renovation program are summarized in the following
table:

11.   One of the main objectives of the project was to support investments in transmission and
distribution networks that were postponed in the past due to financial constraints. In this regard,
the project included investment programs for strengthening transmission and distribution
networks and loan conditions for annual revisions of a least-cost 10-year expansion plan.
Although the impact of financial constraints on transmission and distribution investments was not

4
so severe as in the past, there were still substantial reductions in the investment program that
cannot be justified by a lower demand (see table 8C).
12.   The actual demand increase for 1990-1994 was about 60%  of the demand forecast
prepared in 1989. However, the actual transmission and distribution investment at the end of this
period was less than 25% of the original investment program, while investment in generation was
more than 50% of original investment. These figures show that reductions in the transmission and
distribution investment programs were larger than the reductions in the demand forecast and that
proportionally, generation had priority over transmission and distribution. The following table
summarizes this situation:

Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
13.   The Bank loan was designed as a sector investment loan to help finance a time slice (1991-
1992) of CFE's ten-year investment program. The Bank funds were assigned to four basic
components:
a) A special transmission program, to be developed in the period 1990-1993, consisting of the
installation of about 10,400 MVA of transformer capacity in power substations and



5
construction of about 700 high voltage feeders and transmission lines with a total length of
7,500 kms.
b) A special distribution program to overhaul the distribution grids, to be carried out in the
period 1990-1994, consisting of the addition of 2,080 MVA in distribution substations,
construction of 1,454 kms of primary feeders, 4,100 MVAR in capacitor banks, improvement
of about 32,000 secondary circuits, procurement of switching equipment, meters, switching
equipment and supervisory control equipment.
c) A first stage of an upgrading and renovation program for steam and combined cycle thermal
power plants, to be developed in the period 1990-1994, comprising 38 units with an installed
capacity of 6,720 Mw.
d) A study of the environmental impact of transmission lines and substations ( health hazards,
resettlement and rights-of-way issues) and a country-wide environmental study to determine
the extent of present level of pollution caused by thermal power plants, define a program of
remedial actions, and implement a training program for CFE and SEDUE on these matters.
14.   The loan funds helped finance procurement of goods and services related to the four
components. Most of the physical targets were achieved in a four year period instead of the
originally planned two-year period, due to budgetary constraints imposed by Government that
delayed the implementation of the procurement schedule (see tables 6A and 6B). In 1993,
US$125.5 million of loan uncommitted funds that could not be utilized for the transmission
component were allocated to supplement financing of the civil works of the Zimapan
Hydroelectric Project (financed under loan 3083-ME). For this purpose, the loan agreement was
modified on April 11, 1994. This new component is not examined in this ICR, as it will be
included in the ICR for loan 3083-ME. The final allocation of loan resources was as indicated
below:

15.   Execution of the transmission program was affected by budgetary constraints that were
imposed on CFE quarterly by the Government. In many cases it was necessary to modify delivery
schedules for materials procured with Bank resources in order to meet the constraints for the use
of counterpart funds. To reduce the negative impact on its expansion plans, CFE decided to build
lines and substations under turn-key arrangements with financing and to substitute contractors for
CFE's own construction work-force. From 1989 to 1994 CFE reduced from 90% to 30% the
portion of construction works done by its own work-force.

16.   The distribution component included thousands of small works scattered among the
thirteen distribution divisions that cover the whole country. CFE placed 41 purchase orders for
equipment and materials financed out of the loan resources. From 1990 to 1992 investment in
distribution increased substantially over investment levels in previous years, mainly as a result of
the relaxation of budgetary constraints. However, in 1993 and 1994 investments were subject
again to severe budget ceilings as indicated in the table below. These constraints were partially
offset by a reduction in the reserve margins in power and distribution transformers, and by
construction of primary and secondary networks for new connections financed directly by
customers and local governments, which in some years amounted to about 30% of the expansion
in these networks.

17.   As discussed above in paras. 9 and 10, CFE advanced substantially in the execution of an
ambitious thermal power plant renovation program and met most of its targets.
18.   CFE completed, with the assistance of consultants, the two environmental impact studies
included in the project. One study analyzed the level and impact of electromagnetic fields and
noise generated by transmission lines and high voltage substations, as well as the criteria for
selecting transmission lines routes. The results and recommendations of the study were instituted
in CFE's design and construction practices.
19.   The second study which was completed with the assistance of international consultants
focused on the environmental impact of thermoelectric plants and the design of remedial actions
for reducing emissions of CO, C02, SO2 and NOR, and disposing of residual waters and solid
wastes. As a result of this study CFE established a network to monitor emissions and prevailing
winds near thermal power stations, procedures to improve combustion, a program to use cleaner
fuels in critical areas (natural gas, fuel mixtures and imported heavy fuel oil with 2% of sulfur),
chemical analysis of effluents, ash disposal procedures, and replaced combustion and fuel handling
equipment to reduce emissions.
20.    A training program for CFE and SEDUE personnel was implemented as part of the
environmental impact studies. This included five training courses to disseminate the results of the
study on transmission lines and substations and several courses on the environmental impact of
thermoelectric plants.

21.   In 1989, CFE and the Government signed a 5-year Financial Rehabilitation Agreement
(FRA) that included a tariff adjustment program, measures to complete a capitalization program
for CFE and improve its financial condition, a program to improve CFE operational performance,
and procedures to monitor compliance under the agreement. CFE established in 1989 a special
division staffed with about 60 persons, responsible for the supervision of the FRA and monitoring
the performance at the operational unit level. This division prepared complete and detailed
supervision reports on regular basis. In general, most of the performance targets were met (see
table below), with the exception of the tariff adjustment program (see para. 7 above).

22.   CFE met the financial targets established in the FRA and in the loan conditions up to
1993. However, with the drop in real terms of average tariffs in 1994, CFE fell short of the rate
of return target for that year, although it maintained a high liquidity due to a lower than expected
investments. The following table summarizes the main financial indicators:

23.   CFE advanced substantially in the implementation of the recommendations of the studies
carried out under loan 3083-ME, as required in loan 3189-ME. First, it implemented the
recommendations for improving operation and maintenance practices for generation, transmission
and distribution facilities. Second, it is planning to decentralize operations and implement a new
salary and incentive plan based on productivity gains, according to the consultants'
recommendations. In this regard, CFE is in the process of establishing a holding company
structure with separate generation, transmission and distribution business centers for each power
plant (152), transmission areas (9) and distribution divisions (13). It has established a new cost
accounting system that keeps separate accounts for each business unit and measures productivity



8
gains that are used as a basis for salary increases. In summary, CFE is establishing a new
management style based on commercial principles and incentives for greater efficiency. Finally,
CFE has partially implemented the main recommendations of the tariff study based on marginal
costs, related to cost reflective tariff structure for industrial consumers.
24.     Project implementation was affected mainly by budgetary constraints imposed by
Government to CFE and by time-consuming procurement procedures and other factors (e.g.
suppliers-related problems). Budgetary constraints imposed annually by the Government to meet
macroeconomics targets affected disbursement of counterpart funds negatively and had serious
implications for project implementation. Due to the fact that loan funds were allocated only for
the procurement of goods and consultant services and turn-key arrangements were not
considered, in some cases goods procured with loan funds (specially for the transmission
component) were delivered but could not be installed because of lack of counterpart funds for
installation of these goods. In other cases, it was necessary to cancel ICB's that were already
underway. These problems delayed project implementation and jeopaidized a full utilization of
the Bank resources.
25.   In general, the Banks procurement procedures adopted under the loan proved to be time-
consuming, especially for a borrower that was not used to the procedures established in the
Bank's guidelines and to the long time usually taken for the publication of bidding notices and the
review by the Bank of major decisions. CFE noticed that it took much longer to procure goods
under the Bank's guidelines than under its own internal procedures which were generally limited
to national suppliers. On the other hand, opening up the local market to international competition
resulted in bid prices substantially lower than the official cost estimates. In some cases, local
suppliers were able to win 60% of contracts by reducing the prices they normally bid under LCB
procedures.
Project Sustainability
26.   It is likely that achievement of most of the project objectives, which included promoting
improvements of thermoelectric power plants, strengthening of CFE's capabilities to address
environmental issues, improvement of CFE's operational performance and support of investments
in transmission and distribution, will prove sustainable.  During the 1990-1994 period, CFE
underwent a commercialization process which included a reorganization around business units;
the implementation of a system to measure performance at the unit level; the establishment of
separate accounts for the generation, transmission and distribution businesses, the improvement in
operational performance; strengthening of its financial position; and the incorporation of
environmental considerations in the design and operation of power projects. CFE is now
discussing with the Government measures to obtain greater autonomy in relation to budget,
procurement, staff recruiting, borrowing and management decision.
27.   On the other hand, the Government has initiated an institutional reform in the electricity
power sector that will create a competitive environment for CFE: it passed legislation in late
1992 to allow the development of independent power generation projects (IPPs), created an
Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) in early 1994 as an advisory body to the Ministry of
Energy and Mines (SEMIP) , and in 1994 and 1995, SEMIP issued regulations about wheeling
charges, energy sales to the grid by self-generators and cogenerators, and back-up power charges,



9
which are necessary for the successful operation of IPPs. The Government has prepared a law to
create an autonomous ERC and strengthen the regulatory framework to create a competitive
environment. Furthermore, a working group at the Ministry of Finance is studying the possibility
of privatizing some of CFE's generation plants.
28.   Therefore, a reform for greater competition and efficiency is taking place in the electricity
power sector and CFE is decentralizing its operations for greater autonomy and accountability of
its business units. These changes are conducive to sustaining the achievements generated by the
project. However, several difficult decisions, necessary to continue improving the efficiency and
quality of electricity service still need to be made. These include: (i) tariff adjustments to offset
the negative impact of the massive devaluation of early 1995 on tariff levels in real terms; (ii)
grant greater autonomy to CFE so that it can operate as a commercial enterprise and (iii)
complete the establishment of a regulatory framework that promotes competition and the
participation of private capital as main instruments to improve efficiency and implement a sound
tariff policy.
29.   In relation to the improvements made to mitigate the environmental impact of power
projects, it is likely that they will prove to be sustainable and that CFE will continue to improve in
this area. The 1988 General Law on Ecological Equilibrium (GLEE), complemented by norms
and regulations issued in 1993 and 1994, has established a program to tighten emission standards
for thermal plants to comply in the medium term with international regulations. SEMIP has
prepared a new fuel policy in order to improve the quality of local heavy fuels used for power
generation so as to comply with new regulations. Furthermore, the Government is committed to
meeting new targets on emission control by obligations under the free trade agreement (TLC)
with the USA and Canada.
Bank Performance
30.   The Bank's performance was satisfactory. Bank staff had to assist GOM in defining and
preparing a new project for a borrower that did not have any recent experience with Bank
operations (the previous loan to the power sector had been completed in 1974) " . Project
preparation and appraisal took about two years, from April, 1988 to march, 1990, and three
preparation missions visited Mexico during this period. The basis for defining the project, CFE
ten year investment program and the special programs for generation, transmission and
distribution works, were reviewed in detail with the assistance of consultants. The project was
well defined and realistic loan conditions were agreed with the borrower.
31.   Project implementation was supervised by nine  Bank's missions from  1990 to 1995
(about two per annum), which are adequate for a project that did not experience major execution
problems (see table 11). In late 1993, Bank staff, aware of the negative impact on project
execution by the budget ceilings imposed on CFE's investment program and the delays in the
procurement process, discussed with the borrower alternatives for reallocating the loan balance

and was approved in september, 1989



10
and made arrangements to modify the loan agreement in order to allocate uncommitted funds to
the Zimapan Hydroelectric Project.  Problems related to missing the targets of the tariff
adjustment program (see para. 7) emerged in late 1993, and were noticed at that time by a Bank's
supervision mission. However, this did not become a serious issue probably because CFE was
able to meet some of the financial targets (internal contribution to investment) with lower tariffs.
Only in early 1995, in the middle of the economic crisis, it was evident that a substantial tariff
increase would be necessary.
32.   The Borrower complained in the Final Project Progress Report about the delays in the
procurement process due to the time-consuming procedures used for the publication of bid
notices in the Development Business and for obtaining no-objections from the Bank for tender
documents, bid evaluation and contract awards. The Borrower argued that this was a main cause
for delays in implementing the procurement program. However, one cannot blame these delays
on the Bank's staff but on the procurement procedures for ICB. On the other hand, the borrower
recognized the benefits of using ICB related to lower prices and better compliance by contractors
with tender conditions.
Borrower Performance
33.   The borrower's performance was satisfactory in spite of problems resulting from budget
ceilings, procurement and tariffs. CFE established an implementation unit, submitted timely
progress reports, submitted information and reports as indicated in the loan agreement and
implemented the project diligently in spite of the external constraints imposed on this institution.
By and large, project delays were caused by the investment ceilings imposed by the Government
which required rescheduling deliveries and reprogramming construction and installation of
transmission and distribution works. Also, CFE adopted the recommendations of consultants to
improve its performance by reorganizing operations and implementing new norms and
procedures.
34.   The Government made major advances in improving CFE financial situation and
performance by implementing the FRA, capitalizing CFE's debt and authorizing tariff increases
during the initial years of the operation. Probably the reduction of electricity tariffs for large
industrial consumers in late 1993 was prompted by political considerations to gain support for a
free-trade policy and it was partially justified by the implementation of marginal cost tariffs.
However, at the end, its final financial impact was serious, worsened first by delays in adjusting
residential tariffs in real terms, and finally, by the economic crisis of late 1994 that could hardly be
anticipated.
Future Operation
35.    The Bank loan supported a sector investment project that involved most of the activities
performed by CFE. Although there are no special plans to monitor, evaluate and improve the
future benefits of the project, CFE and the Government have taken several measures that most
likely will sustain the project. CFE has improved its procedures and methodologies to prepare
expansion plans for generation, transmission and distribution systems, prioritize investment
decisions, monitor performance of its business units, and establish efficient pricing policies. Also,
CFE has revised its expansion planning practices with the assistance of qualified international



11
consultants4 and is introducing probabilistic techniques in the preparation of its least cost
expansion plans. In addition, CFE is implementing an ambitious program to establish
computerized geographic information systems and computer-aided design and planning for
distribution networks; is implementing a sophisticated accounting and information system to
monitor performance of its business unit, and it has completed a comprehensive marginal cost
tariff study.
Key Lessons Learned
36.   There are project and sector-related lessons. Related to the project, the main lesson is that
despite the fact that the project was defined as a time-slice of the entire investment program, the
Bank concentrated on the specific works in the investment program which it financed. A more
comprehensive review of the entire investment program would have been justified and necessary,
specially in a situation of budgetary constraints.
37.   A  second project-related lesson is the importance of procurement arrangements.
Awarding separate contracts for construction of civil works and supply of equipment and
materials required to implement the transmission component did not work well under the
budgetary constraints imposed for the execution of CFE's investment program. Due to lack of
counterpart funds, CFE had to delay or suspend civil work contracts, hold back procurement of
new equipment and disbursement of loan funds, and keep expensive equipment in storage waiting
to be installed. It would had been more efficient to finance turn-key contracts to ensure that the
studies, works, and procurement of equipment and materials required to complete each project
were properly financed and coordinated.
38.   A third project-related lesson is that ICB proved its worth. In spite of some delays with
time-consuming ICB procurement procedures, the borrower acknowledged its benefits: lower
prices, better quality and, at the end, benefits to the local industry. Competitive bidding for large
quantities forced the local industry to lower prices, make strategic alliances and improve its
manufacturing facilities. About 60% of contracts were awarded to local suppliers at a lower
price than previous contracts placed by CFE with the same manufacturers following LCB
procedures.
39.   The main sector-related lesson is that it is difficult for the Government to keep long-term
sector policy commitments in a sector dominated by state-owned enterprises operating under a
weak regulatory framework. In spite of a good start in implementing a tariff adjustment program
during 1991-1992, most of real increases in tariffs were lost in a one-year period due to tariff
actions prompted by political considerations: tariff reductions for industrial consumers and delays
in adjusting tariffs for residential consumers and farms. Most likely, the Government would have
faced difficulties in reversing sector policy, had the sector operated under an independent
regulatory framework with strong participation of private utilities.

PRESTAMO 3189-MIE
COMISION FEDERAL DE ELECTRICIDAD (CFE)
INFORME FINAL DEL PROYECTO DE TRANSMISION,
DISTRIBUCION Y REHABILITACION 1990-1994
BANCO INTERNACIONAL DE RECONSTRUCCION Y FOMENTO
SUMARIO EJECUTIVO
INTRODUCCION.
El presente Informe constituye un esfuerzo de sintesis para describir, en terminos
generales, pero de manera clara y objetiva, los resultpdos y experiencias
obtenidas de la instrumentaci6n, administraci6n y ejecuci6n del Proyecto, que fue
financiado parcialmente por el Prestamo 3189-ME.
El destinatario en primera instancia, es el Banco Internacional de Reconstrucci6n
y Fomento (BIRF), Instituci6n que a traves del Oficial del Proyecto, sigui6 de
cerca y en todo momento la evoluci6n y concrecion del mismo; por tal motivo este
Sumario Ejecutivo, no constituye un documento en el que se expliquen a detalle
las diversas operaciones y/o actividades desarrolladas; si no mas bien, partiendo
de la experiencia adquirida entre el Banco y CFE.  Las metas y logros
alcanzados, se comentan bajo un espiritu atitocritico y propositivo y las
observaciones sobre el Proyecto son el mismo sentido.
No obstante lo anterior, se incluyen en el VOLUMEN 2, ANEXOS, el detalle de
las principales actividades desarrolladas en cada Categorfa del Proyecto y todos
los informes de avance.
Esta informaci6n serA de gran utilidaJ, tanto para el lector no involucrado en el
tenia, como para quien desee adentrarse en aspectos especificos del Proyecto.
ANTECEDENTES.
La evaluaci6n del Proyecto, motivo de este Prestamo, se llev6 a cabo en mayo de
1989. Los trabajos conjuntos del BIRF y CFE, se enfocaron al analisis y
discusi6n de los Documentos base: "Programa de Obras e Inversiones del Sector
E1ectrico" (POISE) del afio de 1989, "Programa de Construcci6n de Obras en el
Area de Transmisi6n", "Programa Especial para Ampliaciones y Mejoras en el
Area de Distribuci6n" y "Programa Especial de Modernizaci6n de las Centrales
Termnoelectricas" los que se utilizaron para la elaboraci6n del Reporte Ejecutivo
de Evaluaci6n o Documento Base (Staff Appraisal Report - SAR de
20/marzo/1990). El SAR resume el alcance del Proyecto y sirvi6 como base para
la elaboraci6n de los Documentos Legales del Prestamo, firmados el 25 de
septiembre de 1990, con efectividad a partir del 28 de noviembre del mismo
anio y por un imiporte de US$450.0 millones.

PRESTAMO 3189-ME
2.-   Considerando quie en la evaluaci6n del ejercicio del Prestamo, realizada en 1993,
existia un saldo que no seria utilizado para ejecutar las obras inicialmente
establecidas en el Proyecto, el Contrato del Prestamo fue modificado el 11 de
abril de 1994, para incluir el financiamiento parcial de las obras civiles del
Proyecto Hidroelectrico Zimapain. El presente Informe no incluye el Proyecto
Zimapan, ya que este sera analizado en el Informe Final del Proyecto de
Desarrollo Hidroelectrico, financiado por el Prestamo 3083-ME del Banco
Mundial.
II    OBJETIVOS.
3.-   El objetivo de este Informe es evaluar el desempehio de CFE respecto a lo
planteado en el SAR; todo ello a partir de un espiritu autoc.i tico y positivo a fin
de retomar la experiencia adquirida en las diferentes etapas de ejecuci6n del
Proyecto, para su aplicaci6n en futuras operaciones similares.
4.-   Es conveniente sefialar que el SAR, para la evaltiaci6n del Proyecto, se defini6
a partir del entorno por el que en ese momento atravesaba CFE y el Pais;
eotorno que actualmente presenta escenarios diferentes a los de 1989. Estas
limitaciones, en cuanto a los efectos de la planeaci6n, modificaron tanto el grado
de cumplimiento de los objetivos, como las propias metas.
S.-   El SAR plante6 como objetivos generales del Proyecto los siguientes:
a.-   Lievar a cabo la Rehabilitaci6n de Centrales Termoelectricas para reducir
las necesidades de inversi6n en el Sector Electrico.
b.-   Corregir las distorsiones en la estructujra tarifaria, principalmente en la
reducci6n de los subsidios.
c.-   Mejorar la capacidad interna de CFE, para enfrentar los inipactos al
medio ambiente en la operaci6n de las Centrales Termoelectricas y
construcci6n de las Lineas de Transmisi6n y Subestaciones.
d.-   Apoyar el cumplimiento de las Metas acordadas bajo el Proyecto de
Desarrollo Hidroelectrico (Prestamo 3083-ME).
e.-   Apoyar al Programa de Transmision y Distribuci6n 1991-1992, con el
objeto de cumplir con el aumento de la demanda de energia electrica para
uso industrial, comercial y en menor medida la residencial, incrementando
la eficiencia y confiabilidad del servicio electrico.
A continuaci6n se coinenta el grado de cumplimiento de estos objetivos:
III    CENTRALES TERMOELECTRICAS.
6.-   En t&rminos generales el Programa Original de Rehabilitaci6n de Centrales
Termoelectricas, contempl6 tres metas:
a.-   Incremento de disponibilidad en 678 MW.
b.-   Reducci6n de regimen termico para situarlo en un rango (kcal/kWh) de:



- 32 -
PRESTAMO  3189-ME
2.606-2,263.
c.-   Recuperaci6n de Potencia a su Capacidad de Placa en 418 MW.
El desarrollo de este Programa se llev6 a cabo a traves de cuatr-o subprogramas:
i.-    Unidades de 300/350 MW.
ii.-   Unidades de 150/158 MW.
iii.- Unidades de 75/84 MW.
iv.-  Unidades de Ciclo combinado.
(Ver Tablas 2.3.3 y 2.4.3 en VOLUMEN 2, ANEXO Categoria 3)
El alcance original para estos subprogramas fue la rehabilitaci6n de 38 unidades
en 12 Centrales Termoelectricas; el alcance real fue de $2 unidades en 20
Centrales Termoelectricas. (Ver Tablas 2.4.3 y 5.4.3.1 a la 5.4.3.6a en
VOLUMEN 2, ANEXO Categoria 3).
El I cuniplimienito sobre las nietas del Programna fuie el siguielite:
a.-  Incremento de disponibilidad en 721 MW.
b.-   Reducci6n de regimen ternmico para situarlo en un rango (Kcal/kWh) de:
2,929-2,342.
c.-   Recuperaci6n de Potencia a su Capacidad de Placa en 131 MW.
(Ver Tabla 2.3.3 y GrAifcas 1, P1 a P4 en VOLUMEN 2, ANEXO Categoria 3).
Las tres metas indicadas en el Progrania Original como Metas Fisicas, se
ctiniplieron en un 70% para esta Categoria (ver TABLA No. 1).
Este Programa (Anexo 3.3.1 del SAR) tenfa un costo estimado de US$288.7
millones, para el periodo 1990-1994, de los cuales se programaron US$164.9
millones para 1991-1992. El Contrato Griginal del Prestamo program6 US$103.5
niillones (ver TABLA No. 2), para rinanciar esta Categorfa (23% de los US$450
millones).
El porcentaje de avance indicado en el cumpliiniento de la metas, se logr6 con la
celebraci6n de 25 concursos internacionales, formalizandose 60 pedidos por un
monto global de US$106.504 millones, de los cuales el Banco program6 el 82.3%,
equivalente a US$87.611 niillones. Finalmente el ejercicio del Prestamo, fue de
US$82.629 millones (se tiene una diferencia de US$(-)4.982 millones, entre lo
pagado y lo programado debido a: deslizamiento de otras divisas con respecto al
US$Dolar, saldos pendientes de pago a efectuarse con recursos de CFE y
penalizaciones a proveedores por retraso en suis entregas, ver TABLA No. 2).
Conclusiones: Se cumplieron en forma satisfactoria la mayoria de las metas y se
espera alcanzarlas en un lapso aproximado de tres ahios. Cabe destacar el
incremento en la disponibilidad que de 677.74 MW proyectados, se obtuvieron
720.70 MW, lo cual retleja una importante aportaci6n de disponibilidad y
conflabilidad al sistema (ver Tablas 5.4.1.D.90-94, 5.4. M.E.T.90-94, 2.3.3. y



- 33 -
PRESTAMO 3189-ME
Grrifcas l. en VOLUNIEN 2. ANEXO Categoria 3). Asirnismo, se increment6
la Eficiencia Termica (ver Tabla 5.4.M.E.T.90-94 en VOLUMEN 2, ANEXO
Categoria 3). implicando ull ahorro de energetico de 906.04 Kcal/kWh, dando
como consecuencia, un ahorro de combustible del orden de 1.62 millones de
barriles de combust6leo/anio y 199.094 millones de m3 de Gas/anio (ver anexo 1
y Grafica 1 en VOLUMEN 2, ANEXO Categoria 3). Ademas, la recuperaci6n de
Potencia a su Capacidad de Placa por 131 MW, se conipara al de una unidad de
generaci6n y actualmente estos MW se han incorporado al Sistema
Interconectado Nacional. (Ver tabla 5.4.RP.90-94, 2.3.3 y Grsiricas 1, P1 a P4 en
VOLUMEN 2, ANEXO Categoria 3).
IV    TARIFAS ELECTRICAS.
7.-   En el periodo del Infornie 1990-1994, el nivel de las tarifas electricas tuvo un
avance considerable. En la TABLA No. 3, se muestra la evoluci6n de las ventas
y los precios niedios por tarifa, asi como los incrementos tarifarios en moneda
nacional constante de 1994. El maximo incremento se logr6 en 1992 en donde el
precio medio global alcanz6 un nivel de 23.4%  real arriba del precio niedio
observado del primer semestre de 1989.
Al final del perfodo del Informe 1990-1994, el precio niedio total del kWh fue
de 0.2157 N$/kWh quie result6 nominalmente casi igual al de 1993, lo anterior
debido a que los incrementos de las tarifas 1, 2, 3, 5 y 5A, 6 y 9 fueron
contrarrestados por la reducci6n acordada en octubre de 1993 para las tarifas
generales en alta tensi6n HS y HT. En terminos reales el precio medio global de
las tarifas en 1994 sufri6 un deterioro de 5.7% en relaci6n con el Indice de
Precios Productor. Aun asi, el precio de 1994, fue superior en 14.3% real al
precio medio del primer semestre de 1989.
En este perfodo 1990-1994, se avanz6 tambien en las opciones tarifarias. En
1991, se ofrecieron tarifas de tipo horario para los mayores usuarios del sector
electrico, estas son las que tienen demandas maximas mayores a 1,000 kW.
A partir de esa fecha se han agregado tarifas para altos factores de carga,
opciones por demanda contratada, tarifas interrumpibles y tarifas para atender
los compromisos derivados de las premisas de generacion externa.
V     ASPECTOS AMBIENTALES.
8.-   La Legislaci6n Ambiental Mexicana hace responsable a CFE del control de la
contaminaci6n y del impacto ambiental que ocasiona su Infraestructura, por lo
que el Banco decidi6 apoyar esa responsabilidad a traves del financiamiento de
Estudios para investigar el impacto  ambiental ocasionado por Centrales
Termoelectricas, Lineas de Transmision y Subestaciones, con un costo
programado de US$ 1.0 millones (Categoria 4); asimismo, se incluy6 un
Programa de Entrenamiento (Categoria 5) para capacitar al personal de CFE y



- 34 -
PRESTAMO 3189-ME
Secretaria de Desarrollo Social (SEDESOL, antes Secretaria de Desarrollo
Urbano y Ecologia - SEDUE), en la aplicaci6n de resultados y recomendaciones
obtenidas por los mencionados Estudios. El costo estimado de estos Programas
de Entrenamiento fue de US$ 0.5 millones (ver TABLA No. 2).
Para cumplir con estos objetivos, CFE realiz6 licitaciones para la contrataci6n
de dos Estudios:
a.- Estudios de la afectaci6n al medio ambiente por los Sistemas de Transmisi6n de
Alta Tensi6n. Para estos se contrat6 al Instituto de Investigaciones Electricas
(TIE). Estos Estudios se iniciaron en septiembre de 1990 y concluyeron en
diciembre de 1991, con un costo de N$ 828.329.00.
Conclusiones: El Estudio present6 recomendaciones sobre los campos electricos
y magneticos, ruido audible, la no utilizaci6n de pesticidas y plaguicidas en las
ireas de las subestaciones y derechos de via de lineas de transmisi6n, mismos que
se resaitan como elementos importantes en los parimetros de disenio para los
sistemas de transmisi6n. Simnultaneamente, se efectuaron los  Cursos de
Entrenamiento (Categoria 5), sobre este tenia, del 9 de junio de 1991 al 31 de
enero de 1992 ( ver VOLUMEN 2, ANEXO Categorias 4 y 5).
b .- Estudio del impacto ambiental de Siete Centrales Termoelectricas. Se contrataron
a: Uni6n Iberoamericana de Tecnologia Electrica,S.A. (UITESA) y al IIE, para
evaluar la naturaleza y volumen de los contaminantes, mediante la
caracterizaci6n y cuantificaci6n de estas emisiones al medio ambiente. El costo
de estos Estudios fue de US$1.8 millones y se iniciaron en mayo de 1991,
concluyendo en diciembre de 1992.
Conclusiones: El Estudio cumpli6 con los objetivos que se trazaron y en la
actualidad se estan aplicando las recomendaciones siguientes: observaci6n de
plumnas de chinieneas, programas de puesta a punto, cambio de combustible o
mezcla de ellos en (algunas) Centrales Ternioelectricas, instalacion de equipo de
monitoreo de emisiones e inmisiones, analisis de aguas residuales, continuaci6n
de la capacitaci6n te6rica y practica; ademas, se obtuvieron recomendaciones en
metodos y sistemas para lograr la reducci6n de emisiones, incluyendo lo
correspondiente al estudio de tratamiento de agua residuial y disposici6n de
desechos s6lidos. Su resultado ha sido satisfactorio en cuanto al mejoramiento
para el control de combusti6n, emisiones e inmisiones y la utilizaci6n de
combustibles mas limpios. Por lo que se refiere a los Programas de
Entrenamiento ( Categoria 5 ), estos se llevaron a cabo entre noviembre de 1991
y marzo de 1992 (ver VOLUMEN 2, ANEXO Categorias 4 y 5).
VI   APOYO A LAS METAS DEL PRESTAMO  3083-ME.
9.-   El Prestamo 3189-ME esta estrechamente relacionado con el Prestamo 3083-ME
que financia parcialmente el Proyecto de Desarrollo Hidroelectrico (Aguamilpa



- 35 -
PRESTAMO  3189-ME
y Zimapan). de tal suerte que algunas de las condiciones de efectividad del
prinmero, constituveron el cumplimiento de los comproniisos contractuales del
segundo.
Con fondos del Prestamo 3083-ME, CFE realiz6 licitaciones para elaborar los
siguientes Estudios:
DI.- Estudio para mejorar la operacion de los Sistemas de Potencia de CFE,
incluyendo, analisis de criterios de diseiio, practicas de operacion y eficiencia de
las instalaciones de transmisi6n y distribuci6n. Result6 ganador para elaborar
el Estudio, Electricite De France Internacional (E.D.F.), habiendose iniciado el
27 de noviembre de 1990 y concluido el 7 de febrero de 1992. Actualmente se
estan aplicando las recomendaciones derivadas de los Estudios de Eficiencia
Operativa formuladas por E.D.F. en materia de Generaci6n. Despacho de Carga,
Manejo de Combustibles, Concepci6n de Centrales en lo relacionado al disefio de
nuevas Centrales Termoel6ctricas. Estas recomendaciones se aplican por las
Subdirecciones de: Generaci6n y Transmisi6n-Transformaci6n-Control.
D2.- Estudio para desarrollar mejoras en los sistemas organizacionales y gerenciales
de CFE. La empresa ganadora para elaborar dicho Estudio fue la firma de
Conistiltoria McKinsey que inici6 actividades a partir del 23 de agosto de 1990,
enifocandose principalmente, hacia aspectos de modernizaci6n organizativa de la
Entidad. Durante el desarrollo del Estudio se incorporaron recomnendaciones
sugeridas por el Banco sobre el contenido y alcance del mismo. En la visita de la
Misi6n de Supervisi6n efectuada en octubre de 1992, CFE entreg6 al Jefe de la
misma, el Documento Final que incluy6 las observaciones sugeridas por el Banco,
principalmente en lo referente a las medidas implantadas y el Programa de
Acciones a desarrollar en el futuro.
De los beneficios aportados a la Ent;dad, resaltan entre otros, las acciones de
sensibilizaci6n al cambio, que fueron adoptadas por el Organismo, reflejadas no
solo en modificaciones de su estructura organizativa, sino tambien en la
implantaci6n, a traves de Programas de Productividad convenidos con el
Sindicato Unico de Trabajadores Electricistas de la Republica Mexicana
(S.U.T.E.R.M.), para la aplicaci6n de indices de desempeuio a nivel de: empresa,
areas de responsabilidad diferenciadas y trabajadores. Lo anterior, en un
ambiente de promoci6n de la calidad de servicio al cliente, cultura de costos y
capacitaci6n continia al personal.
D3.- Estudio Tarifario de CFE. Las consultoras ganadoras para realizar este Estudio
fueron E.D.F. y Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (E.N.D.E.S.A.) de Chile,
desarrollandose en el lapso de septiembre de 1990 a diciembre de 1991. Se
realiz6 en cinco etapas: Diagn6stico; Estudio de la Demanda; Calculo de Costos
Marginales del Sistema ; Estudio de Tarifas Te6ricas y Propuesta de Tarifas de
Aplicaci6n.



- 36 -
PRESTAMO 3189-NIE
El Estudio ha tenido una influencia importante en cuanto a la metodologia que
aport6 a la CFE y sus conclusiones han sido tomadas en cuenta en el disefio
tarifario.
VII   PROGRAMAS DE TRANSMISION Y DISTRIBUCION.
10.-  Conio apoyo a los Programas para satisfacer el incremento en la demanda de
energia electrica, con eficiencia y conriabilidad, CFE decidi6 iniciar un Programa
Especial de Transmisi6n y Distribuci6n, de acuerdo a las metas fisicas que se
muestran en la TABLA No. 1.
a.- Programa de Transmisi6n, Categoria 1.- Este Programa (Anexo 3.1.1 del SAR)
tenfa tin costo estimado de US$860.0 millones, para el periodo 1990-1993, de los
cuales US$637.1 millones se programaroni para 1991-1992. El Contrato Original
del Prestamo program6 US$160.0 niillones (ver TABLA No. 2), para financiar
esta Categoria (35% de los US$450 millones).
Para alcanzar estos objetivos se celebraron 9 concursos internacionales,
fornmalizandose 22 pedidos coI1 un monto global de US$122.852 millones, de los
cuales el Banco program6 el 83.4% que equivale a US$102.443 millones.
Finalmente el ejercicio del Prestamo, fue de US$103.850 millones (se tiene una
diferencia de US$1.407 millones, entre lo pagado y lo programado debido al
deslizamiento de otras divisas con respecto al US$Dolar, saldos pendientes de
pago a efectuarse con recursos de CFE y penalizaciones a proveedores por
retraso en sus entregas, ver TABLA No. 2).
Las Metas Ffsicas programadas para 1990-1993 (Anexo 3.1.0 del SAR) y
alcanzadas en el perfodo 1990-1994 son las siguientes:
Construcci6n de 10,400 MVA y 700 alimentadores, en Subestaciones, de los
cuales se construyeron 9,817 MVA y 633 alimentadores, lo que representa un
avance del 94.4%  y 90.4%, respectivamente.   En cuanto a Lineas de
Transmisi6n, se programaron 7,500 Km. y la meta alcanzada fue de 7,557 Km.,
lo que representa un 100.7% de avance respecto al Programa. Calificandose lo
anterior como satisfactorio (ver VOLUMEN 2, ANEXO Categoria 1).
b.- Programa de Distribuci6n, Categoria 2.- Este Programa (Anexo 3.2.1 del SAR)
tenia un costo estimado de US$770.9 millones, para el periodo 1990-1994, de los
cuales US$451.1 millones se programaron para 1991-1992. El Contrato Original
del Pr6stamo program6 US$140.0 millones para financiar esta Categorfa (31%
de los US$450.0 millones). Posteriormente se acordaron dos recategorizaciones
con el Banco (ver TABLA No. 2), por lo que de acuerdo a la segunda, se
increment6 al 38% del total del Prestamo, quedando un importe a financiar de
US$170.0 millones.
Para alcanzar estos objetivos se celebraron 11 concursos internacionales,
fornializandose 41 pedidos por un monto global de US$169.392 niillones, de los



- 37 -
PRESTAMO 3189-ME
cuales el Banco program6 el 80.5% que eqtuivale a US$136.385 nillones.
Finalniente el ejercicio del Prestamo, fue de US$ 136.477 niillones (se tiene una
diferencia de US$0.092 niillones, entre lo pagado y lo progranmado, debido a:
deslizamiento de otra divisas con respecto al USDolar, saldos pendientes de pago
a efectuarse con recursos de CFE y penalizaciones a proveedores por retraso en
stls entregas. ver TABLA No. 2).
Las Metas Ffsicas programadas inicialmente (Anexo 3.2.0 del SAR) , asi comno
sui cuniplimiento se muestran en detalle en la TABLA No. 1. E;n terminos
generales y con apoyo de la contra-partida de CFE: Solidaridad, Prestamo
591/OC-ME del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) y otros Recursos, se
logr6 un avance superior a] 100% en ocho de los once subprogranias de la
Categoria 2 (ver VOLUMEN 2, ANEXO Categoria 2).
VIII  DESEMBOLSOS DEL PRESTAMO.
11.-  Los fondos del Prestamo debieron financiar, en forma parcial, las inversiones del
periodo 1991-1992, termninando la entrega de los bienes en 1992. Para esto se
previ6 un Programa de Desembolsos del Prestamo (Punto 3.17 y Anexo 3.4.4. del
SAR), del 30 de junio de 1990 al 30 de junio de 1993, para permitir la
liquidaci6n de los contratos y pago de facturas presentadas durante 1991-1992,
quedando programado el cierre del ejercicio del Prestamo al 31 de diciembre de
1993. De hecho, debido a retrasos en la ejecuci6n del Proyecto. fue necesario
extender la fecha de cierre del Prestamo hasta el 31 de diciembre de 1994 y los
fondos fueron autorizados a desembolsarse totatmente el 22 de mayo de 1995.
(Ver TABLA No. 4)
Para cuniplir con el Programa, conforme a lo indicado en el Contrato del
Prestamo, Nacional Financiera (NAFIN), Prestatario del Prestamo, abri6 una
Cuenta Especial, para la operaci6n, administraci6n y control de los recursos
rinancieros. Las Categorfas para  la adquisici6n de equipos y materiales
finaniciados parciatmente por el Proyecto, se agruparon en los siguientes
Programas:
1.- Adquisici6n de equipos para el Programa Especial de Transmisi6n.
2.- Adquisici6n de equipos para el Programa Especial de Distribuci6n.
3.- Adquisici6n de equipos para el Programa Especial para la Rehabilitaci6n de
Centrales Termoelectricas.
4.- Servicios de Consultoria para el desarrollo de Estudios de Impacto Ambiental
de Lineas y Subestaciones, asf como tambien de Centrales Termoel6ctricas.
5.- Programas de Entrenamiento sobre los resultados de los Estudios del punto
anterior, para el personal de CFE y SEDESOL.
6.- No asignados.

ADQUISICIONES.
14.-  En materia de adquisiciones, se procedi6 a la aplicaci6n de las Normas utilizadas
por el Banco, por lo cual fue necesario homologarlas con la Normatividad vigente
en 1989-1994, plasmada en la Ley de Adquisiciones, Arretidamnientos y Prestaci6n
de Servicios, relacionados con Bienes Muebles (Diario Oficial de la Federaci6n
el 8 de febrero de 1985), al igual que el Reglamento de la misma Ley (Diario
Oficial de la Federaci6n del 13 de febrero de 1990). Tanibien se tuvo que
adecuiar lo relacionado con los lineamentos del Reglamento para la Aplicaci6n de
Penas Convencionales, por Incumplimiento en los Plazos de Entrega y la
Especificaci6n Comercial General CFE-LOOOO-31, cuyos conceptos se integraron
parcialmente en las Bases para Licitaci6nes Piblicas Internacionales.
Coii las Bases se procedi6 a particuilarizar las diversas licitaciones a desarrollar,
las cuales fueron integradas en fuinci6n de las requisiciones y las especificaciones
t6cnicas de las areas, categorizadas como   Transmisi6n, Distribuci6n y
Rehabilitaci6n, elaborniidose una misma licitaci6n cuando se solicitaron equipos
o materiales siniitares con diferentes requisicionies.
Se realizaron 30 licitaciones piblicas y 9 negociaciones, contandose con la
presentaci6n de ofertas de 428 participantes nacioniales y extranjeros, tomando
en cuenta que atgunos participaron en varias licitaciones.
Teni6ndose finalniente la asignaci6n de 118 pedidos y 3 contratos de Consultoria,
en diferentes monedas con un importe equivalente a US$400.803 millones. de los
cuales el Banco program6 US$328.494 millones (82% del total del Prestamo), ya
que de actierdo a su politica, solamente financi6 la adquisici6n de bienes, Libre
a Bordo (LAB) en fabrica, para proveedores nacionales; Costo. Seguro y Flete
(CIF) hasta punto de entrada, para proveedores extranjerns, sin incluir
Impuestos de Importaci6n, al Valor Agregado (IVA), Fletes y Seguros dentro del
Territorio Nacional (ver VOLUMEN 2, ANEXO Gerencia de Abastecimientos).
Finalmente el ejercicio del Prestamo,   para las Categorias I al 5 fue de
US$324.492 millones (se tiene una diferencia de US$(-)4.002 millones, entre lo
pagado y lo programado, debido a: deslizamiento de otras divisas con respecto
al US$Dolar, satdos pendientes de pago a efectuarse con recursos de CFE y
penalizaciones a proveedores por retraso en sus entregas; no se incluye aqui el
ejercicio por US$76.25 millones para la Obra Civil Zimapin, ver TABLA No. 2).
En las adquisiciones desarrolladas bajo este esquema, la afluencia de
participantes fue mayor a la registrada en licitaciones internacionales para el
mismo tipo de equipos, anteriormente lIevadas a cabo por CFE. Esto debido a su
difusi6n en diferentes publicaciones internacionales, de actieido a las indicaciones
del Banco Mundial.
Al tenerse mayor niimero de participantes, se observ6 que los precios cotizados,
fueron menores a los que normalmente se adquirian los equipos, debido a la



- 40 -
PRESTAMO 3189-NIE
misma competencia y los altos volumenes adquiridos, con lo que se logr6 reducir
los costos de adquisici6n en benericio de los Programas a desarrollar.
Del desarrollo de las licitaciones se pudo apreciar que el tiempo titilizado en las
niismiias a partir de la publicaci6n de la convocatoria hasta la firimia y entrega de
pedidos, ftie mayor a los tiempos utilizados para licitaciones normales con
recursos de CFE, esto debido principalmente al proceso adiministrativo, ya que
para todas las etapas de la licitaci6n era condici6n la obtenci6n de la "No
Objecion" por parte del Banco Mundial, teniendo que ser enviados los diversos
documentos a la sede central del Banco en Washington, D.C., E.U.A.
Adicionalmente la solicitud de publicaci6n de convocatorias en el "Development
Business" debia ser enviada 35 dias antes de la fecha de pt.!licaci6n.
15.-  Consideramnos  cuatro factores principales que afectaron la realizaci6n del
Proyecto en materia de adquisicioines:
a. Factores fuera del control gubernamnental o causas fortuitas.
El desarrollo del proyecto se vio afectado por la giierra civil de la ex-Yugoslavia,
en dos pedidos que consideraban bienes de ese Pafs.
b. Factores generalmente sujetos al control gubernamental.
En estos podemos destacar las politicas econ6micas, sobre todo, la reducci6n de
los techos presupuestales durante el desarrollo del Proyecto, lo que origin6 su
retraso, ya qtie los recuirsos de la contra-partida correspondiente a la instalaci6n
y ptuesta en operaci6n de los equipos adquiridos se vieron disminuidos, dando
conio resultado el defasaniiento de los Programas.
c.- Factores que inciden en las variaciones de precios de materiales y equipos.
Para la adquisici6n de bienes con alto contenido de materia prima sujeta a
fltictuaciones internacionales, se tom6 la previsi6n de establecer precios variables
con f6rmulas de ajuste, desde las Bases de Licitacion.
d. Factores sujetos a control interno de CFE.
Estos afectaron en forma parcial el desarrollo del Proyecto, ya que los periodos
empleados para el desarrollo de las licitaciones fueron afectados por los tiempos
de publicaci6n de convocatorias en el Developnient Business, plazos entre
publicaci6n y recepci6n de ofertas, tiempo de evaluaci6n y obtenci6n de No
Objeci6n en las diferentes etapas del Proyecto.

X     OPINION SOBRE EL CUMPLIMIENTO DE LOS OBJETIVOS.
18.-  El cumplimniento de los objetivos descritos anteriormenite, qtie en terminos
generales puede calificarse como satisfactorio para CFE, le ha perniitido hacer
frente al rezago en infraestructura electrica, situaci6n que habia propiciado,
entre otros aspectos: reducciones considerables en los margenes de reserva de
capacidad y energia, mayores costos de operaci6n. problemas en la aplicaci6n de
los criterios de planeaci6n y operaci6n del sistema; situaci6n que repercutia
rinalmente en la calidad y continuidad del servicio proporcionado a los ustiarios
de los diferentes sectores tarifarios.
Con la participaci6n de CFE en la apertura comercial, a nivel internacional, las
licitaciones de materiales y equipos, perrnitieron que dichos insumos se
adquirieran a menor precio y mejor calidad. Esta situaci6n tuvo ull efecto
positivo eii la Industria Nacional, la cual mejor6 sus procesos de fabricacion que
le permitieron adjudicarse una parte significativa de las licitaciones
internacionales realizadas, ya que de un total de 118 pedidos de la adquisicion
de bienes, para las Categorfas 1 a 3, por Uin nioito global de US$398.742
nIillones, COI1 un programa de financianiiento del Banco por US$326.439 niillones,
se adjudicaron 69 pedidos a proveedores nacionales por un monto a financiar de
US$192.644 millones, que representa el 59 % (ver VOLUMEN 2, ANEXO,
Gerencia de Abastecimnientos).
En lo relativo a los aspectos ambientales, CFE ha avanzado en el cumplimiento
de la Legislaci6n Ambiental del Pais, adoptando como criterios de diseuno de los
diferentes elementos del sistema electrico, las Nonnas y Reglamentos vigentes
para preservar la salud htimana y el medio ambiente.
Es importante seuialar que el cumpliniiento de estos objetivos fue posible gracias
a los recursos de contra-partida, tanto de la misma CFE, conio de los recursos
del Prestamo 591/OC-ME del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID),
Solidaridad, lo que permiti6 el apoyo para cumplir con las metas globales
propuestas en el SAR.
El cumplirniento de los objetivos, represent6 para la Entidad una exigencia mayor
en el desempeiio de sus funciones, desde las etapas de planeaci6n de la expansion,
hasta las de operacion y mantenimiento del sistema electrico, dejando una
importante experiencia que ha permitido afrontar los probleimas con mejores
elementos de juicio, lo que ha representado un importante benericio para la
economia de la Entidad y del Pais.
XI   EFECTOS DE LOS TECHOS PRESUPUESTALES EN LA EJECUCION DEL
PROYECTO.
19.-  Uno de los factores que influy6 de manera importante en la ejecuci6n del



- 43 -
PRESTAINO  3189-ME
Provecto fue el correspondiente a los "Techos presupuestales" adoptados por el
Gobierno coin el rin de controlar el gasto puiblico, de actierdo a las politicas
macroecon6mnicas aplicadas.
Los recursos otorgados por el Prestamo forman parte integral del Presupuesto
de CFE, de tal forma que los escasos recursos presupuestales para su aplicaci6n
en la infraestructura electrica, adicionalmenite al rezago de inversiones,
inipactaron significativamente el cumplimienito de las nietas previstas, a pesar
de tener los materiales y equipos, en algunos casos no se cont6 oportunamente
con recursos de contra-partida, para la instalaci6n de los niisnios. Esta situaci6n
se enipez6 a hacer patente en el ejercicio de 1991 y para 1992 se tuvo que
recurrir a la renegociaci6n de contratos ya firmados para diferir las fechas de
entrega de los materiales v equipos, tambien ftie necesario cancelar licitaciones
en proceso previos a su adjudicaci6n, asi como niodificar el calendario de las
nuevas licitaciones.
Derivado de lo anterior fue necesario solicitar la amnpliaci6n en el plazo de
ejecuci6n del Prestamno en 12 meses; asi como efectuar diversas recategorizaciones
al mnisnio, destacandose la inclusi6n en la Categorfa 6, del financianiiento de la
Obra Civil ZiniapAii. (Ver TABLA No. 2).
XII   RECOMENDACIONES.
20.-  Acortar plazos en tramites de licitacion; principalniente en lo relacionado con el
anialisis de propuestas, firmas de pedidos y pago de anticipos, planteando un
programa con eventos simultaineos para acortar el tienipo de licitaci6n en futuros
Proyectos.
21.-  Ampliar las facultades del Representante del Banco Muiidial en la Ciudad de
Mexico, para que pueda revisar los diversos documentos y otorgar la "No
Objeci6n" correspondiente, agilizandose el proceso de adquisiciones.
22.-  Contratar para prestamos subsecuentes, obras bajo el concepto "Ilave en mano",
que incluyan estudios previos, indemnizaciones, derechos de paso, construcci6n,
adquisici6n de materiales y equipo, su instalaci6n, supervision y puesta en
servicio.
23.-  Uniricar criterios para la asignaci6n de Categorias con base a los requerhiientos
de cada Area, con el objeto de evitar sobregiros y reclasificaciones posteriores.
24.-  Solicitar con oportunidad las cartas de No Objeci6n para la parte financiable de
los pedidos, para evitar retrasos en el pago de los mismos.
25.-  Homologaci6n de criterios para el alcance del rinanciamiento; como el caso de
fletes y seguros en territorio nacional, que son financiados por el BID.

PRESTAMNIO 3189-ME
XIII  CONIENTARIOS.
26.-  En terminos generales consideramos que la participaci6n de NAFIN, como Agente
Financiero de Gobierno Federal, en relaci6n con el Contrato de Prestamo,
Garantia y Proyecto del Credito 3189-ME otorgado por el BIRF, fue de gran
ayuda para lograr que CFE, pudiera ejercer en su totalidad el credito
mencioniado. Lo anterior en virtud de su capacidad negociadora con el Banco, asi
como por sui disponibilidad y atenci6n para resolver los imprevistos con toda
oportunidad.
27.-  En cuanto a la participaci6n de CFE en la ejecuci6n del citado Prestamo, es
conveniente senialar que se logr6 la colaboraci6n de las areas involucradas en la
mavoria de los casos, salvo alguna excepcion como fue el requerimiento de
confirrmaci6n sobre saldos comprometidos pendientes de pago y la programaci6n
de los mismos por parte de dichas Areas, informaci6n que se requirio para
programar el desenibolso del saido del credito durante la pr6rroga administrativa
otorgada por el Banco.
28.-  Comno prinmera actividad posterior a la firma de los documnentos legales de futuras
operaciones con el Banco; seria conveniente la realizaci6n de un seminario donde
participen representantes del Banco, de la Secretaria de Hacienda y Credito
Pulblico (SHCP), del Agente financiero designado y del organismo ejecutor. Lo
anterior con objeto de intercambiar puntos de vista, encaminados al diseuio de
estrategias conjuntas que permitan una mejor administraci6n y ejecuci6n del
Proyecto, bajo una perspectiva de compartir, definir y delimitar Ambitos de
competencia y responsabilidad entre las diferentes instancias que intervienen en
el desarrollo del Proyecto.
