MEXICO
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1. LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN)
Guarantor:               The Government of Mexico
Beneficiary and
Executing Aenc:          Comisi6n Federal de Electricidad (CFE)
Amount:                  US$450.0 million equivalent
Terms:                   Repayment in 17 years, including five years grace,
at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
On-lending Terms:        The loan proceeds would be on-lent by NAFIN to CFE
under terms and conditions which would include,
inter alia, (i) the sub-loan would be denominated
in US dollars, (ii) the on-lending terms and
conditions would be the same as the Bank loan, and
(iii) NAFIN would charge a fee amounting to 10 of
the interest charged by the Bank and an
intermediary fee. US dollar to Mexican peso
exchange and interest rate risks would be borne by
CFE, and NAFIN would bear the US dollar to basket
of currencies exchange risk.
Proiect Obiectives: (a) Promote improvements and renovation of
thermoelectric power plants to reduce the investment requirements of the
sector; (b) correct distortions in the tariff structure, reducing cross
subsidies among consumers to improve end-user efficiency; (c) strengthen
CFE's internal capabilities to address environmental issues related to the
operation of thermoelectric power plants and to the construction of
transmission lines; (d) further pursue the improvement goals agreed under
the Hydroelectric Development Project (Loan 3083-ME) on management,
technical, financial and energy conservation aspects; and (e) fund CFE's
transmission and distribution program for 1991-92 with the purpose of
meeting industrial and commercial demand and slightly expanding residential
coverage, while improving the technical efficiency and reliability of
electric service.
Proiect Description: A sector investment project that includes a time
slice (1991-92) of CFE's investment program in transmission, distribution
and thermal plant renovation. The Bank loan would help fund four basic
components: (a) a transmission and substation prograu aimed at expanding
and improving installations rated 400 kV to 115 kV (402 of the total loan);
(b) a distribution program that would expand and improve the distribution
grid (34.5Z); (c) a program to renovate thermoelectric power plants to
improve thermal efficiency and availability of CFE's main plants (25.0X);
and (d) environmental and pollution control studies related with these
components (0.52).



Prolect Risks: The main risk would arise from failure to cosntinue
increasing electricity rates, which vould affect sector finances and result
in a shortage of local counterpart funds and in project execution delays.
However, the Government appears to be firm in its price policy reforms and
has shown strong evidence of its commitment; in this context, the recent
extension to the economic pact signals the end to a long period of price
freeze, shifting instead to a more predictable and continuous process of
regular public sector price adjustments. Another concern is the lack of
access to external financing in the amounts required, for which the Bank
would play an active role in putting together a cofinancing package. The
project does not pose special technical or environmental problems.

2. THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTORS
A. INTRODUCTION
2.01     Two issues have dominated the performancl' of the Mexican economy
in the eighties: the overhang of a massive debt, which has required
attaining significant trade surpluses to service it and to reduce its
relative weight over time, and the problem of containing inflation, fueled
to a large degree by fiscal deficits. The Government's present ecor.omic
strategy addresses these two issues through a program of structural reforms
aimed at opening up the economy to external competition, limiting the role
of the State in the productive sectors and fostering the development of
non-traditional exports and through foreign debt re-negotiation. In
addition, the stabilization program that was put in place in December 1987
has been successful in reducing inflation by addressing tha fiscal issue
by, amongst other measures, raising the prices for goods and services
provided by public enterprises, and by following a restrictive monetary and
fiscal policy and implementing short-term price and wage controls.
2.02     In this context, energy sector policies play a very important
role. In addition to the significance of petroleum exports as a source of
foreign exchange, there are major issues regarding the size of the
subsidies that the power sector has been receiving from the Federal
Government, the distortions to resource allocation caused by subsidized
fuel prices and electricity rates, and the costs to the economy of
investment and procuremera policies in the power sector, which were not
based on economic conside.ations. The Mexican Government has begun to
address these issues: fuel prices have been raised in real terms,
procurement by public sector enterprises is being opened to external
competition, and under the recently approved Hydroelectric Development
Project, electricity rates are being increased and investment programs are
being based on economic criteria.
B. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources
2.03     Mexico is endowed with substantial and diversified energy
resources, both renewable and non-renewable. Its main resources are
hydrocarbons, with total proven reserves of 67.6 billion barrels of crude
oil equivalent. These reserves include 46.2 billion barrels of crude oil
(about 51 years of reserves to production ratio at 1988 average production
of 2.5 million bbd), 6.8 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent of
condensate and 14.6 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent of Iry natural
gas (53 trillion cubic feet). Although gas reserves are important, their
exploitation is associated to the production of oil (Annex 2.1.0). Proven
coal reserves discovered so far amount to 600 million tons (equivalent to 3
billion barrels of crude oil) with an additional 140 million tons of
probable reserves; most of the coal is classified as steam coal and is used
for power generation; it is not suitable for coking purposes. The known
proven uranium reserves are 10,600 T, but total reserves potential arc
probably much larger.



- 5 -
2.04     Of the renewable energy resources, the most important is hydro-
power. There are 554 identified sites with a theoretical output of 150
TWh/year, of which approximately 80 TWh/year (equal to Mexico's electric
energy sales in 1987) are technically feasible, equivalent to 22,000 MW, of
which 35Z have been installed. However the development of these projects
faces the following serious restrictions: (a) most of the sites are located
in the 3outhern region, and would require the development of long
transmission lines to the large power markets in the central and northern
regions; and (b) the development of the large sites ct the Usumacinta
River, which borders Mexico and Guatemala, would cause serious
environmental and resettlement problems and would flood ancient Mayan
archaeological ruins.
2.05     About 400 known geothermal zones have a potential for the
installation of up to 3,900 MW in thermal plants; at present only 700 MW
have been installed. This is one area where there is still room for
expansion for power generation. Non-conventional potential resources, like
solar and biomass energy, do exist but they would not contribute
significantly to energy production in the country in the medium-term.
Energy Demand and Supply
2.06     In 1988, Mexico's gross energy production was 2,038 thousand Tcal
(equivalent to 200 million TOE), of which nearly 902 was hydrocarbon
production. Gross internal energy consumption was 1,245 thousand Tcal or
1.4 TOE per capita.1   The 1988 energy balance is shown in the next table,
and the evolution of the energy supply and consumption in Annex 2.1.0.

2.07     The gross energy supply increased from 1975 to 1982 at about 172
p.a. (average) and then remained stable with slight yearly fluctuations.
The gross energy consumption by source of energy shows that the
contribution of hydrocarbons increased from about 762 in 1975 to about 852
in 1980 and fluctuated around 852 thereafter. Final energy consumption for
the industrial sector and the transport sector accounted for 36Z in each
while the residential and commercial consumed 24Z, and the agricultural
sector 3.42. Because of energy savings as well as economic stagnation,
energy consumption in the period 1982-88 increased only slightly (Annex
2.1.1).
National Energy Policy and Sector Obiectives
2.08     The National Energy Program prepared by the Ministry of Mines and
State Enterprises (SEMIP)and approved by the Government in August 1984 as
part of the National Development Plan, presented an analysis of the role of
energy in the country's development, the main problems faced by the sector,
and set general sectoral objectives and medium term (1984-88) and longer
term (to the year 2000) targets and strategies. The broader sectoral
objectives are: (i) meeting overall energy demand including export of
hydrocarbons; (ii) energy conservation, par icularly in the state-owned
industries with emphasis on simple, inexpensive measures to cut down
inefficient energy use; (iii) energy diversification away from the current
excessive reliance on hydrocarbons, towards greater use of alternative
primary energies such as hydroelectricity; and (iv) improving the financial
situation of sector's enterprises, so as to achieve full cost recovery.  A
new National Energy Program, prepared as part of the new National
Development Plan of June 1989, places special attention to three main
issues: energy conservation, environment and pricing (Annex 2.1.0).
2.09     While the goal of meeting overall energy demand has been achieved,
the other goals have been only partially fulfilled. In particular, the
energy diversification and conservation objectives are still major issues
of the energy sector that need to be addressed. Because of the depressed
international markets, petroleum production declined by an annual average
of 32 during 1982-1986 from 2.75 million bbd to 2.43 million bbd;
production in 1988 was 2.51 million bbd. Between 1978 and 1988, gross
electricity generation increased at an average rate of 6.7X from 53,252 GWh
to 101,958 G'Wh.
Energy Conservation
2.10     Energy conservation in Mexico started to be a major consideration
in energy planning and a policy factor at the beginning of this decade, but
results obtained so far have been modest because the programs implemented
have not been comprehensive and were limited in scope; achievements were
concentrated mainly in the industrial sector, which accounted for more than
75Z of the energy saved.
2.11     Energy conservation in Mexico is linked to the modernization of
the industrial and transport sectors, the two miajor energy users. During
1982-87, a promotional drive was undertaken to promote the use of advanced
equipment, machinery and new technologies that would promote industrial
production efficiently. The European Economic Community is assisting SEMIP



to develop a model that would help predict the energy demand for the
transport sector and evaluate measures to save energy both in the transport
as well as in the industrial sectors. Furthermore, in order to consolidate
its efforts nation wide, the Government established in September 1989 a
National Energy Commission, supported by state and local commissions.
Under loan 3083-ME (the Hydroelectric Development Project), the Bank is
financing the execution by SEMIP of a national energy conservation program
that would promote the efficient use of energy in Mexico by the industrial,
transport, commercial and residential usere.
Petroleum Products Production, Uses and Prices
2.12     Petroleum products production increased at an average annual rate
of 2.5Z from 1.24 million bbd in 1982 to 1.41 million bbd in 1988. The
volumes of the petroleum products marketed within the country increased at
an average annual rate of 1.22 during 1982-87. During the same period fuel
oil increased at an annual rate of 8.1? due to the large requirements of
CFE for this product. The use of gasoline remained at the same level of
1982 while LPG use increased by an average rate of 6.1?. Diesel oil's use
decreased by a rate of 3.2Z.
2.13     In the period 1983-88 fuel prices were increased, in real terms,
1272 for natural gas, 128? for residual oil, 83Z for LPG and 612 for
diesel. At the end of 1989, the domestic prices for most petroleum
products were close to, and for some products considerably above, the
relevant international (border) prices, the exception being residual oil
("combustoleo") and LPG, whose domestic prices were about 75Z and 542 of
their border prices (Annex 2.1.2). Significantly, residual oil is an
important cost element in the price of electricity, and CFE is an important
user of this type of fuel as it consumes 70? of the residual oil produced
in the country. On January 26, 1990, the Government enacted the Rules to
the Federal Law for Public Enterprises ("Reglamento de la Ley Federal de
las Entidades Paraestatales"). Under these rules, prices and tariffs for
goods and services shall be established considering principles of economy,
efficiency and financial viability; when such goods and services are
tradeable internationally, prices shall be fixed considering the prices
prevailing in the international market. During negotiations, the
Government gave assurances to the Bank that these principles shall be
applied to the pricing of oil and oil derivatives and the Government agreed
to increase by June 30, 1992, the price of the residual oil consumed by CFE
for thermoelectric generation to international level (para. 4.01(a)).
*International level' is defined as the average f.o.b. export price for the
same type of fuel obtained by r 4EX during 1989.
2.14     The mechanisms by which fuel prices are fixed and the type of
taxes applied are explained in Annex 2.1.0. The public enterprise
Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) plays a subordinate role in setting these
prices, which are mostly decided by SEHIP and SHCP. Two taxes are applied
to petroleum products: Value Added Tax (VAT) and "Impuesto Especial Sobre
Produccion y Servicios' (IEPS).
Energy Sector Organization
2.15     The energy sector is under the jurisdiction of SEMIP and it is
composed of two subsectors: hydrocarbon and power. Hydrocarbons are



- 8 -
controlled by PEMEX which is backed by a sophisticated research institute,
the 'Instituto Mexicano del Petroleo" (IMP). The power subsector is also
controlled by a public enterprise, Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE)
which has a wholly-owned subsidiary "Compaflia de Luz y Fuerza del Centro,
(CFLC) in charge of distributing electricity in the Federal District and
the vicinity. CFE gets technical support from the Instituto de
Investigaciones Electricas (IIE). Annex 2.1.3 presents an organization
chart of the sector and Annex 2.1.4 gives additional facts about PEMEX.
With the new 675 MW Laguna Verde Nuclear Plant being constructed by CFE,
which is expected to start commercial operation in 1990, the nuclear
subsector is making its first steps in Mexico. Annex 2.1.0 gives more
details on the organization and regulations of the energy sector.
Problems of the Energy Sector
2.16     A major problem of the sector is the high consumption of energy
per unit of outpus-, which has caused a high growth of energy consumption.
Gross energy consumption in the country grew at an average annual rate of
9Z during 1975-82; although this high rate was partly due to high rates of
economic growth Pnd urbanization and to the transformation of the
industrial structure in Mexico toward more energy intensive industries, it
also reflected the inefficient use of energy, fostered by very low prices
and lack of a comprehensive conservation program.
2.17     A second problem is the high dependency on non-renewable
resources, due partly to a biased pricing policy towards hydrocarbons;
their share in internal consumption of primary energy in 1988 amounted to
822 (Annex 2.1.1). An important potential for diversification is in
electricity generation through tne development of hydro, coal, geothermal
and nuclear generation. However, the goal of the Government of reducing
the share of hydrocarbons to 70Z by the year 2000 might be too optimistic.
2.18     A third problem of the sector is the poor financial situation of
sector enterprises, which the Government is addressing through a pricing
policy based on economic criteria. The pace of price adjustments, however,
has had to steer a careful compromise between these objectives and short
run stabilization policy goals.
C. THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
Power Sect.or Orparitzation and Regulation
2.19     Electricity service in Mexico is under the responsibility of one
public utility: Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE), in operation since
1937. It generates, transmits and distributes electricity on a country-
wide basis, except for distribution in the area of Mexico City and environs
which are served by Compaflia de Luz y Fuerza del Centro (CLFC), a former
private utility, now wholly-owned by CFE. CFE is under the jurisdiction of
the Ministry of Energy, Mines and State Enterprises (SEMIP) which
supervises energy-related activities. The Ministry of Finance and Public
Credit (SHCP) regulates electricity prices and the financial operations of
state enterprises, while the Ministry of Planning and Budget (SPP)
supervises the budget and regulates the contracting and procurement
activities of the sector. Finally, the Ministry of Agriculture and Hydro
Resources (SARH) is concerned with the regulation of water resources.



2.20     As established by the General Law of the Electricity Service,
amended in December 1983, CFE has an Administrative Council (Junta de
Gobierno) as the governing unit in its organizational structure, with
overall corporate responsibility for company affairs. Its Chairman is the
Minister of Energy, Mines and State Enterprises (SEHIP) and its other
members are the Ministers of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP); Agriculture
and Hydro Resources (SARH); Commerce and Industrial Development and
Planning and Budget (SPP); the General Director of the National Government
Oil Company (PEMEX); and three labor delegates. A Supervisory Council has
three members representing the Federal Comptroller, SEMIP and the
Administrative Council. The General Director is the Chief Executive
Officer of the company. The directors of Construction, Operations and
Administration report directly to him, as well as the heads of the
Accounting, Finance and Legal departments. An organization chart is shown
in Annex 2.2.1.
2.21     CFE's distribution activities are carried out by 14 geographical
regional offices with a limited degree of autonomy. A total of about
120,900 persons work for the power sector, of which 89,200 belong to CFE
and 31,700 to CLFC; out of the total sector employees, about 68,500 operate
the power system, 33,700 are temporary workers in the construction force
and 18,700 are contingent workers for major maintenance of power plants and
transmission and distribution installations. Under the ongoing
Hydroelectric Development Project, CFE is executing a management study to
adequately evaluate the areas that need strengthening and develop a program
to achieve this. The study will be completed by June 30, 1991, and by
December 31, 1991, CFE will exchange views with the Bank on the conclusions
and recommendations of the study and provide to the Bank a plan of action
satisfactory to the Government and the Bank, to implement such
recommendations including a timetable for implementation. Annex 2.2.0
gives a more detailed description of CFE.
Electricity Power Demand and SUP ly
2.22     The Mexican power sector has registered important achievements:
electric coverage, which amounted to 54? of the population in 1970,
increased to 86Z by 1988; access to electricity in urban areas is 94Z, and
67Z in the rural areas. A rural electrification program, started in Mexico
more than 30 years ago, aims to increase coverage to 75Z by 1995.
Electricity consumption (total sales) increased at an annual rate of 7.82
from 1970 to 1988 of which a large share was due to new connections:
during this period, the number of users increased by 5.8 Z annually.
Industrial consumption amounted to 56Z of total sales during 1988, followed
by residential with a share of 20.?, 92 by the commercial sector, 8? by
agricultural activities, 5 public services and 2? exports. In 1988, total
electricity consumption amounted to 1021 kWh per capita 2 , as compared to
447 kWh in 1970.
2/ Consumption in other countries in 1988: Brazil: 1,250 kWh per capita;
Colombia: 950; and Chile: 1200.



- 10 -
2.23     In 1988, the total installed capacity for public service was
23,921 MW, of which 322 were hydroplants (see Annexes 2.3.1 and 2.3.2). In
addition, there were 3,500 MV of captive capacity, mainly thermal. Energy
losses were 13.62 with respect to net generation, of which about 70? are
estimated to be technical losse8s and 30? unaccounted energy (billing
errors, theft, etc.). As part of the ongoing Hydroelectric Development
Project, CFE is carrying out a study to improve the efficiancy of CFE's
electric power system, including analysis of design criteria and operating
practices; the study, which would recommend means of reducing energy losses
(technical and non-technical), will be completed by June 30, 1991. The
following table presents an overall view of Mexico's historical (1981 and
1988) and projected (1992) power sector.

cl   With respect to net generation.
2.24     The power sector is an important user of hydrocarbons: in 1988 an
equivalent of 179 thousand Tcal were used for generation, more than 8? of
total gross interr.al energy consumption. According to the current
expansion plan and CFE demand forecast, 190 thousand Tcal will be used in
1992 for thermal power generation (almost 9Z of total domestic energy
consumption), and 264 thousand Tcal (10Z) in 1997. In 1988, residual oil



- 11 -
provided 77Z of the total CFE's thermal generation, gas 152 and coal 8I.
CFE's program of diversification of energy resources will be carried out
observing least-cost principles through the installation of 2,860 MW (of
which 1,240 MW are being partially financed by the Bank, Loan 3083-ME) in
hydroplants in the period 1989-1997; 418 MW in geothermal plants, 1,350 MW
in a nuclear plant (Laguna Verde, whose first 675 MW unit is expected to be
on line in 1990); 2,100 MW in domestic coal plants and 4,150 MW in dual
fuel (oil and coal) thermal plants. In order to further increase
diversification, the Government has entrusted to CFE the prospection for
coal, as this type of fuel will be used mainly for power generation. Coal
exploitation is made by a semi-public enterprise (Minera Carbonifera Rio
Escondido SA - MICARE), of which CFE is a shareholder.
2.25     The demand forecast presented by CFE during appraisal of the
project, estimates a rate of growth of 6.62 p.a. for energy sales for the
period 1988-1998, as compared to 6.42 in the period 1978-88. The forecast
takes into account an increase in consumption by existing consumers
(approximately 4.0Z) and the connection of new services including important
industrial loads already requested to CFE. This projection, which is the
result of aggregation of local demand forecasts prepared by each
distribution region. was verified by CFE using an econometric model that
correlates electricity consumption with macroeconomic indicators (GDP,
gross public investment and population). Although CFE's methodology
yielded adequate forecasts in the past when the economy grew steadily, the
macroeconomic and financial uncertainties of the future as well as the
planned rate adjustments might lead to a lower demand than forecast by CFE.
The Bank prepared sensitivity analysis considering electricity price
increases to reach marginal cost levels by 1997, concluding that demand
could grow at rates as low as 52 p.a. in the period 1988-98. However,
other sensitivity cases considering optimistic outlooks for Mexico's
economy resulted in higher demand growths; thus, for corporate planning
purposes, power system expansion has been based on CFE's forecast.
Adjustments to the generation expansion program to account for other demand
growths, could be easily introduced by CFE by advancing or delaying the
construction of thermo-electric power plants, which require short lead
times. The Bank agreed with this approach as CFE is committed, under the
Hydroelectric Development Project (Loan 3083-ME), and as it has been done
in the past, to review annual;:y the demand forecast, considering prevailing
market and economic conditions; any resulting modifications to the
expansion program will be presented to the Bank by October 31 of each year.
In addition, the Bank is collaborating with CFE in the development of a
more robust forecasting methodology, that would improve CFE's planning
capability. Annex 2.3.0 gives details of CFE's electric power market,
including demand forecast.
Operational Performance
2.26     During its 50 years of existence, CFE has extended electricity
service across the entire country, reaching high rates of population
coverage. CFE has the staff to perform efficiently the planning, design,
construction and operation of the electric power system. Plant maintenance
planning, scheduling and stocking of spare parts are satisfactory. The
number of customers per employee in operation is 166, about average for the
larger Latin American countries. During the last seven years, because of



- 12 -
financial constraints, CFE was forced to limit investments and to reduce
expenses in the maintenance of power plants; as a result, the existing
installations were overworked, decreasing the availability of the thermal
power plants to 65Z in 1981. Lately, however, a rehabilitation program
improved their performance (in 1988, availability was 76Z) and the goal is
to reach 77Z by 1994 (see Annex 2.3.4). The proposed project includes an
upgrading component that would help CFE to achieve this objective (para.
2.38).
Power Sector Planning
2.27     The Nationel Development Plan, approved by the Government in
August 1984 and updated in June 1989, establishes global objectives,
policies, strategies and goals. Since 1962 CFE prepares and updates
annually a detailed Ten-year Investment Program for the Power Sector
(Programa de Obras de Inversiones del Sector Electrico-POISE), which is
approved by CFE's Administrative Council, getting in this way implicit
approval from the central Government. Considering macro-economic
conditions, SPP and SEMIP define investment ceilings for CFE, which in the
past resulted in investment programs that favored thermal generation (the
least capital intensive option) at the expense of hydroelectricity.
2.28     CFE has developed or adopted mathematical models for the
optimization of decisions on the power system investment program. A set of
models are used for power generation planning, to select and time the
installation of new power plants from a list of candidate projects that
include hydro, nuclear, geothermal and thermoelectric (oil and coal fired
and dual fuel) power plants. The associated transmission lines and
substations are analyzed using mathematical models to check technical
characteristics such as load flow, voltage levels and system stability and
reliability. Distribution planning has been done in a deterministic and
relatively traditional fashion (see Annex 3.2.0), but with the assistance
of the Mexican Institute of Electrical Research (Instituto de
Investigaciones Electricas) CFE is now introducing advanced techniques for
distribution planning. The investment program is developed in two phases:
first, a least-cost program is determined considering, among other,
conditions such as hydrology, availability and efficiency of equipment,
fuel cost at border prices, operation and maintenance cost, and cost of
capital. In a second stage, the least-cost program is subject to a
financial analysis considering availability of funds and budget
constraints. The least-cost generation expansion program established by
CFE for 1989 and 1990 was modified to consider an investment ceiling
imposed by SPP. After 1991 no financial restrictions have been included.
Considering both CFE's own financial position and the macroeconomic
situation, which in the near future calls for a continued fiscal effort to
achieve the Government stabilization targets, the investment program and
the corresponding financial requirements are reasonable.
2.29     The Government and CFE agreed under the ongoing Hydroelectric
Development Project (Loan 3083-ME) that CFE shall: (a) each year during
implementation of the Project, carry out a technical and economic analysis
in order to update the investments proposed to be made in the power sector
under the Ten-year Investment Program and shall, when making such analysis:
(i) utilize least-cost principles; (ii) utilize export prices for oil



- 13 -
derivate products; (iii) consider all environmental and resettlement costs
associated with making such investments; and (iv) take into account
financial restrictions on CFE due to macroeconomic conditions. Each
updated Ten-year Investment Program shall include an updated financial
projection to carry out the Plan, and an economic justification of, and a
viable financing plan for, major generation installations not previously
included in the Ten-year Investment Program. CFE shall review with the
Bank each updated Plan, promptly after it has been completed; (b) execute
only the installations included in the Ten-year Investment Program; and (c)
by October 31 of each year during implementation of the Project, and at the
request of either the Bank or the Government, review with the Bank and the
Government, the progress in carrying out the Ten-year Investment Program.
The Investment Program
2.30     The proposed power sector Ten-year Investment Program which is
discussed in detail in Annex 2.4.0, is based on a generation expansion
program which considers updated demand forecasts. A total investment
equivalent to US$35.1 billion (constant 1989 prices) is proposed for the
period 1989-1998, during which a total of 17,626 MW would be added to the
system, at an average unit cost of US$1,993 per kW installed for the entire
system; the program includes 55Z to be invested in generation, 22? in
transmission and 232 in distribution (see Annex 2.4.1). Unit costs used by
CFE to prepare the investment program are in line with international costs.
It should be mentioned that during this period the Laguna Verde Nuclear
Power Plant (1,350 MW), construction of which began in 1976, will be
completed at an expected unit cost of close to US$2,520 (1989 base) per KU,
excluding financial charges; no further nuclear developments are scheduled
to start in the next decade.
2.31     The proposed investment program is sound, as it adequately
addresses sectoral objectives and takes into account both economic and
financial concerns. The allocation of 23? of the investment program to
distribution is higher than the average 171 invested in the past five
years, and adequate for the purpose of improving reliability to consumer
level. The proposed project would focus on options to reduce investments
(i.e. peak load pricing, demand management, seasonal rates, etc.), improve
conservation and start plant renovation; during the execution of the
project the criteria for distribution expansion will be reviewed
critically. The project would also assist CFE in carrying out programs to
improve further the efficiency and reliability of the distribution network,
to extend metering to all customers now connected directly, and to shorten
the billing period through decentralization measures.
2.32     Under the ongoing Hydroelectric Development Project, SEMIP is
carrying out, with the assistance of CFE, a co-gener&tion study and will
consider the possibilities of utilizing for public service part of the
3,500 MW privately owned in Mexico and possible incentives for new private
investments in co-generation as means to reduce CPE's investments in
generation facilities.
2.33     As part of the Ten-year Investment Program, CFE has designed three
"special programs to address some urgent investment needs in the area of



- 14 -
transmission, distribution and thermal power plants. These programs, to be
partially financed by the proposed operation, are described in the
following paragraphs.
The Special Transmission Program
2.34     In the last six years CFE had to reduce drastically investments in
new installations because of its difficult financial situation and had to
prioritize investments, usually giving preference to the construction of
new generating plants or completion of the ones under construction, in
order to meet the growing demand of electricity; investments in
transmission, distribution and power plant renovation and upgrading were
low, barely enough to maintain the quality of service and energy losses at
levels normally achieved by CFE. As the situation cannot be suetained, CFE
has decided to start a special four-year transmission program, justified in
detail in a study submitted to the Bank (see Annex 3.1.0). The program
will have an estimated current cost of US$860.0 of which US$637 million
would be spent in the 1991-92 period; the proposed Bank loan would finance
about 212 of the total cost (US$180 million).
2.35     Details of the program are given in Annex 3.1.0; the physical
goals of the special four-year program are summarized as follows:
Construction of transmission lines:
- Rated 400 kV                         1,485 km
- Rated 230 kV                         2,505 km
- Rated 138 kV and lower               3.494 km
Total                                7,484 km
Installation of new transformers:
- Rated 400 kV                        3,005 MVA
- Rated 230 kV                        4,918 MVA
- Rated 138 kV and lower              2.475 MVA
Total                              10,398 MVA
The Special Distribution Program
2.36     The situation of the distribution system in the entire country is
critical, as feeders and distribution transformers are loaded above
economical and in many instances, above acceptable thermal levels, about
1,000,000 customers are connected to the grid without meters, power factor
needs to be improved, and older installations must be replaced. CFE,
knowing that the situation could deteriorate rapidly, has decided to start,
wita the financial assistance of the proposed project, a special five-year
program justified in a study presented to the Bank (see Annex 3.2.0); the
program will have an estimated current cost of US$770 million, of which
US$451 million would be spent in the 1991-92 period, mainly to purchase
part of the materials and equipment required for the program, and to
install part of that equipment; the proposed Bank loan would finance about
202 of total cost (US$154 million).
2.37     The scope of CFE's special distribution program is discussed in
detail in Annex 3.2.0, and its physical goals for the 1990-94 period are
summArized below:



- 15 -
Construction of 115 and 60 kV lines             500  km
Construction of primary feeders                1400  km
Construction of secondary feeders            18,800  km
Capacity additions to 109 substations         2,080  MVA
Installation of distribution transformers    1,250  MVA
Addition of capacitor banks                   4,100  MVAC
Purchase of maintenance vehicles                830  units
Purchase of computerized billing equipment      665  units
Purchase of electric meters                     5.6 million
The SRecial Thermal Power Plant Renovation Program
2.38     CFE has a total of 150 thermoelectric generating units, with a
total name-plate capacity of 17,055 MW (Annex 2.3.2). The lack of adequate
levels of maintenance in existing thermal power plants has been the cause
why several of CFE's plants are operating at less than optimal performance.
To take care of the problem in a systematic way, CFE has prepared a special
upgrading program for 38 of its units with a total rated capacity of 6720
MW; most of these units have 11 to 31 years of service, and therefore
require an upgrading, replacement or repair of materials and systems such
as boiler superheaters, reheaters, economizers, air preheaters, boiler
casings, turbine and feedwater heaters, instruments and controls, etc. The
program, to be carried out in the 1990-94 period, will have a total current
cost of US$289 million (US$165 million to be spent in the 1991-92 period),
of which the proposed Bank loan would finance 391 (US$113 million), for the
purchase of parts and materials.
2.39     The above special upgrading program is discussed in Annex 3.3.0;
the goals to be achieved with the program ares
-    Increase availability of the units,
adding available capacity to the
power system by ..............................  678 MW
-    Recuperate name-plate generating
capacity adding available capacity to
the power system by .... .... ..... *....... * ..... 418 MW
-    Improve thermal efficiency from
the present range (in kCal/kWh) of ............ 3000-2615
to a new range of  .. ....................... 2606-2263
Mexico's Nuclear Power Proaram
2.40     The Laguna Verde nuclear power plant, with two units rated 675 MW
each, is located 70 km NNW of Veracruz, in the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
No other nuclear plant is being considered for the expansion of the power
generating system in the near future. Although the construction was
decided by the Government and the site was selected in 1970 with assistance
of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), its construction only
started in 1976. The first unit is now completed, nuclear fuel was loaded
in October 1988, it reached operational tests at 752 power, and is
scheduled for commercial operation at 1002 power in 1990. Construction of
the second unit is progressing well and is scheduled for commercial
operation at the end of 1993. The plant has a Boiling Water Reactor with a



- 16 -
Mark II type containment building, engineered and constructed to meet the
American Nuclear Regulatory Commission's safety and environmental
protection standards and codes and licensing regulations - including the
backfittings recommended as a result of the analysis made of the Three Mile
Island Nuclear Plant accident - as well as the recommended radiation
exposure limits set by the International Commission of Radiation
Protection. CFE has submitted to the National Commission of Safety and
Safeguards (NCSS, empowered by law to exert the nuclear regulatory
functions in Mexico) the Final Safety Analysis Report, and the NCSS is in
the process of issuing the operating licence for the first unit. In the
past 20 years CFE and NCSS (or its equivalent in the past) have been able
to develop the manpower required to regulate and implement a nuclear power
project to meet international standards of quality and safety, at present
with only essential support from consultants and manufacturers.
2.41     Thr*Te Operating Safety Analysis Review Teams-OSART, fielded by the
IAEA upon request of the Mexican Government (the latest one was held in
September 1987), have advised CFE and CNSS on additional measures to be
taken to get Laguna Verde operating without undue risks to the population
and the environment; CFE has followed the OSART recommendations. Also,
twice a year the IAEA safeguard inspectors make the material balance of the
nuclear fuel as established in the tri-lateral safeguard agreements entered
among IAEA, Mexico and nuclear suppliers, in compliance with the full scope
of nuclear safeguards required by the Nuclear Weapons Non-Proliferation
Treaty and the Tlatelolco Treaty (Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons in Latin America), of which Mexico is a party.  Nuclear fuel and
radioactive wastes will be stored at site during at least 10 years.
Through an environmental program ccmprising sixteen stations, a laboratory
and suitable equipment, CFE is doing the radiological monitoring of the
air, water, animal, vegetable and marine life since 1982 and will continue
to do so through the nuclear power plant lifetime and beyond. Two
important emergency plans are already in place at Laguna Verde: the
Internal Emergency Plan, intended to mitigate the effects of accidents and
to protect the nealth and safety of the nuclear plant staff, and the
External Radiological Emergency Plan, intended to face, at regional level,
emergencies derived from accidents or incidents in the plant that may
affect the population and ecosystems, including the evacuation of about
17,000 persons in a 16 km radius around the Laguna Verde nuclear plant.
2.42     CFE gave assurances to the Bank tUat the abovc practices, which
are acceptable to the Bank, will continue in the future to ensure a safe
operation of Laguna Verde, and CFE will continue having environmental and
safety reviews every two years, with the assistance of experts from a well-
known international nuclear energy agency.
Electricity Pricing
2.43     There are two major issues confronting electricity tariffs in
Mexico: first, electricity rates have been subsidized by the Government
since the 1970's, and second, tariff structures do not reflect the costs of
supplying electricity to each customer class. During 1986, revenues
covered operating costs and left a positive margin of 6.2Z because fuel
costs (set at level of about 65Z of international prices) were subsidized
by the Government. It was then estimated that fuel subsidies plus



- 17 -
government direct contributions to CFE amounted to about 1.1 of GDP and,
consequently contributed significantly to the fiscal deficit, which was
they, 15.6Z of GDP. Significant progress has been achieved in reducing
these subsidies, and in 1989, fuel subsidies and Government transfers
amounted to about 0.32 of the GDP.
2.44     Electricity rates fell, in real terms, about 372 between 1980 and
1983; between 1984 and 1986, rates were sharply increased in nominal terms
(136Z, 462 and 120Z respectively in 1984, 1985 and 1986) but due to higher
than expected inflation, they still failed to reach the 1980 level. In
1987 and 1988 average rates were increased on 1132 and 1252, respectively,
in nominal terms but rates did not achieve the 1980 level due to offsetting
inflation. The Government and CFE are now committed to a sounder policy
under targets included in the sector's Financial Rehabilitation Agreement
(PRA), which requires that the 1991 average electricity rate should be
increased 18.8S in real terms with respect to those rates of the first
semester of 1989; in line with the agreement, average rates were already
increased on average 26.62 in 1989 (or 5.52 in real terms). This increase
is particularly noteworthy as it was implemented at a time when there was a
price and wage freeze in effect. It is also important to note that the
increase sought to address some of the most glaring tariff structure
distortions. thus residential rates for consumers above 200 kWh per month
were increased by 2002, public lighting service by 1002, and water supply
and sewerage service by 102.
2.45     Most Government subsidies would be eliminated by 1991, the only
ones remaining would be for low-income residential and rural users (about
22 of total revenues). The rates to industrial customers who use 56Z of
CFE's energy sales are close to LRMC; the agricultural consumers, using 82
of energy, have the largest gap with respect to LRMC. On the average,
CPE's average electricity rate for 1988 was 762 of the LEMC, and it is
planned to reach LRMC (about UScents 6.5 per kWh) by 1997.  Annex 2.5.0
presents additional information on CPR's electricity rates.
2.46     CFE, with IDB financing, engaged the services of ENDESA, the
National Electric Utility of Chile, to assist in the preparation of a
tariff study based on marginal cost principles, which the Bank reviewed and
found satisfactory as a guideline for policy actions. On the basis of this
study, CFE has already started to apply tariffs based on marginal costs to
industrial consumers; by April 1990, 270 industrial customers consuming 272
of CFE's sales are expected to be billed under this program. Under the
Hydroelectric Development Project, CFE agreed to carry out a Second Phase
of the Tariff Study to set up a tariff system based on marginal costs for
medium voltage consumers, to be completed by June 30, 1991, and to exchange
views with the Bank on the conclusions and recommendations of such study
and provide to the Bank a plan of action, satisfactory to the Government
and the Bank. to implement such recommendations, including a timetable for
implementation not later than December 31, 1991.
2.47     During negotiations, the Government and CFE agreed to modify, not
later than January 1, 1992, the present electricity tariff structure with
the purpose of promoting efficiency in the use of electricity and reducing
cross-subsidies among CFE's customers; CFE agreed to link this action plan
with the results of the Tariff Study being executed under Loan 3083-ME
(para. 4.01 b)).

Financial Performance
2.48     Power sector finances showed a deteriorating trend during the
1976-1985 period. Operating income which was positive until 1982, became
substantially negative in 1983. Positive results were obtained during
1984-1986 but again became slightly negative in 1987 basically because rate
increases did not keep up with inflation. During this period, heavy
interest charges on debt resulted in negative net income for every year.
This required subsidies and cash transfers from the Government as well as
large levels of borrowings, some years in excess of the investment program,
resulting in a great and increasing dependency on external funding. In
1988, CFE's finances started to improve as a result of the FRA (para.
2.52); a positive rate of return was achieved (1.42) and, for the first
time, the self financing ratio was positive (1.82). Annex 2.6.0 contains
supplementary information on CFE's finances together with actual and
forecast financial statements. Key financial indicators are detailed in
Annex 3.6.0.
Government Subsidies and Cash Tranfers
2.49     As compared to the GDP, total Government subsidies and cash
transfers increased from 0.72 in 1979 to 2.3Z in 1983, and then declined to
0.32 in 1989, as shown in the following table:
1979    1983    1985    1986   1988   1989
a) In US$ million             1651    3488    3179    1370    664    939
- Fuel oil subsidies        712    1332    1036      275    181    225
- Cash transfers            938    2156    2142    1095    483    714
b) As percentage of GDP        1.2     2.3      1.7     1.0    0.4    0.3
- Fuel oil subsidies        0.5     0.9      0.6     0.2    0.1    0.1
- Cash transfers            0.7     1.4      1.1     0.8    0.3    0.2
2.50     Fuel subsidies increased from 0.52 of GDP in 1979 to 0.92 in 1983,
and then declined to 0.12 in 1989, as a result of the Government policy of
reducing the difference between domestic and export prices. Currently, the
domestic residual oil price is estimated at 752 of the export price. The
financial forecasts assume that in 1992 both prices would be the same
(para. 2.13).
2.51     Cash transfers increased from 0.72 in 1979 to 1.42 in 1983, to
help meet the heavy debt service burden (para. 2.48). Since then, cash
transfers have declined to 0.22 as a result of the application of the FRA.
Financial Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA)
2.52     In view of the serious deterioration of sector finances, and
within its general policy of adjustment with growth, in August 1986 a
three-year agreement for the financial rehabilitation of the power sector
was signed between the Government and CFE, which included as a first step
the conversion of about US$8.6 billion of CFE's debt into equity, leaving
CFE with a balance of about US$1.7 billion debt. The agreement included



- 19 -
provisions for substantial rate increases in real terms and improvement of
productivity (efficiency targets and operating costs). It also included
actions to strengthen institutionally CFE, including improvements in
organization and accounting, and established a reporting scheme to monitor
its implementation. The Government and CFE signed a new FRA on August 31,
1989, which defined more precisely certain terms and sets out realistic
productivity improvement targets. Annex 2.7.0 presents a summary
description of the FRA and proposed targats. The new FRA, to be in effect
until December 31, 1994, includes, inter alia, the following agreements and
targets:
a)   to convert CFE's short-term debt (US$500 million) into Government
equity;
b)   to limit CFE's short-term borrowing (less than one year) from
internal and external markets to no more than 10 percent of annual
cash operating expenses;
c)   to increase electricity rates in real terms not less than 92
average in 1990 and 92 average in 1991 over those rates existing
in the first semester of 1989;
d)   to achieve by 1990 and thereafter, a funding mix for new
investment with the following compositions 402 minimum interual
funding, 102 maximum Government contribution and 502 maximum
borrowings;
e)   to improve CFE's operational productivity according to certain
specific performance targets;
f)   to continue the implementation of hourly tariffs and other
measures to reduce peak load.
Financial Forecast
2.53     CFE's financial situation is expected to improve substantially
during project implementation, provided that CFE's efficiency targets under
the FRA are achieved and that electricity rates are adjusted, by 9Z p.a. in
1990 and 1991, according to the agreements reached with the Bank under the
Hydroelectric Development Project, allowing CFE to reach a rate of return
of about 32 in 1990 and close to 42 in 1991. These commitments would be
repeated under the project.
2.54     Under the above assumptions, CFE would be able: (i) to generate
over 402 of its total financing requirements for investments; (ii) to
achieve a debt service coverage ratio higher than 1.5 starting in 1990; and
(iii) to eliminate all need for Government equity contributions starting in
1991, except for small subsidies for electric service to low-income
residential and agricultural consumers. To assure the successful
rehabilitation of CFE's finances started under the ongoing Hydroelectric
Development Project, during negotiations, CFE and the Government agreed (i)
to reach, as a minimum, the following rates of return on net fixed assets
in operation revalued annually under methods acceptable to the Bankt 42 in
1992, 52 in 1993; 62 in 1994, 6.52 in 1995: and 72 in 1996 and thereafter,
and (ii) finance at least 402 of its annual investment budget with
internally generated funds. If in any year CFE would be unable to finance



- 20 -
at least 402 of its investments, the above rates of return shall be
increased as required (para. 4.01c )).
2.55     Under Loan 3083-ME, the Government and CFE are committed to review
annually, by October 31 of each year, the Ten-year Investment Program for
the power sector (para. 2.29). In order to assure that CFE's short-term
goals are consistent with the long-term strategy, the Government and CFE
agreed, under the proposed operation, to present to the Bank by October 31
of each year the proposed CFE's annual operating and investment budgets and
financing plan for the upcoming fiscal year (para. 4.01 (d)).
2.56     It is expected that to achieve those targets, in addition to the
tariff increases required in 1990 and 1991 (para. 2.53) CFE will have to
continue increasing electricity rates in real terms on average about 62 in
1992, 42 in 1993, 62 in 1994 and lower amounts thereafter. The rate hikes
of September and December 1989 represent an average increment of about 5.5Z
(in real terms) over those rates existing during the first semester of
1989.
Government Power Sector Strate&v
2.57     Within the framework of its general energy policy, the Government
has established the following objectives for the electric power sector:
a)   to promote an efficient use of electricity through realistic
pricing policies, energy conservation, and improvement in sector
operations;
b)   to diversify the sources of power generation by supporting the
development of cost-effective alternatives to conventional oil-
fired steam plants, such as hydroelectric, coal fired, and
geothermal power plants;
c)   to strengthen the financial condition of the sector by
implementing the FRA, through significant conversion of debt into
equity, electricity rate increases and reduction of operating
costs; and
d)   to make electricity available to an increasing number of consumers
with emphasis on low-income consumers and on productive rural
consumers.
CFE's Procurement Practices
2.58     In accordance with Government legislation and policies, in the
past CFE restricted its sources to national suppliers, and permitted
international competition only when no Mexican manufacturer or contractor
existed or had the capacity to do a job. However, after Mexico joined GATT
in 1986, public enterprises, including CFE, are gradually opening their
market to international competition. Under the proposed operation, all of
the contracts financed by the Bank will be procured in accordance with Bank
guidelines for procurement of goods and services and hiring of consultants.



- 21 -
Analogous commitments are being obtained under the proposed IDB loan, co-
financer of the project. One of the objectives of the Bank's strategy
towards the Mexican power sector is to support the Government policy of a
gradual opening of procurement to international competition.
Bank Participation in the Sector
2.59     The Bank participated actively in financing development plans in
the power sector in Mexico until 1974, when the Eleventh Power Project was
completed. Until then, the Bank had made eleven loans to the power sector
for a total of about US$705 million. During the period of Bank
participation, the sector grew at a steady pace and its finances and
institutional aspects were substantially strengthened. Thereafter, Bank
missions visited Mexico in several occasions to consider resuming lending,
but no further loans were possible as important financial and procurement
issues remained unsolved. During the absence of the Bank, sector finances
deteriorated substantially as the Government let electricity rates erode,
in real terms, following a policy of subsidies financed by petroleum
revenues. Only two project performance audit reports have been prepared
for Bank power loans to Mexico: No. 859 dated September 9, 1975 and 1775
dated October 26, 1977 for the Third and Fourth Power Sector Programs
(loans 659-ME and 834-ME), respectively. Both PPARs show the positive
contribution of Bank resources to the sector's physical development and to
the achievement of an important technical objective: frequency unification.
They also show the Bank's inability to solve CFE's institutional problems
and to reverse the deteriorating trend in sector finances which resulted in
its long absence (15 years) from sector operations.
2.60     in August 1986. the Government and CFE signed a power sector
Financial Rehabilitation Agreement and in August 1989 the Agreement was
renewed for another five years (para. 2.52). The FRA focuses on the most
critical issues that the Bank had been raising and defined measures to
address them. During the recent past the dialogue with the power sector
has been constructive and led the Government to request financial
assistance from the Bank for the Hydroelectric Development Project (Loan
3083-ME, approved in June, 1989) and for the proposed Transmission and
Distribution Project.
Bank Obiectives and Long-Term Strategy
2.61     The Bank's role in the sector is to support the general energy
policy of the country and the objectives established by the Government for
the power sector bys
a) assisting the country to obtain added foreign currency for
financing, on adequate terms, the power sector investment program,

3. THE PROJECT
Introduction
3.01     At the request of the Government, the Bank sent three preparatory
missions to Mexico, the first one on April 1988, with the purpose of
assisting CFE to define a project that would qualify for a Bank loan of
quick disbursement; a time-slice (1991-1992) of the power sector's Ten-year
Investment Program was selected as the project. Appraisal took place
starting June 26, 1989; negotiations took place in Washington on January
29, 1990 and were concluded in Mexico City on March 9, 1990.
Project Description
3.02     The proposed loan would be a sector investment loan that would
help fund a time slice (1991-92) of CFE's Ten-year Investment Program;
within this time-slice, the funds of the Bank would help finance four basic
components: (a) a special transmission and distribution program aimed at
expanding and improving installations rated 400 kV to 115 kV (40.0? of the
Bank's proposed loan; para. 2.34); (b) a special distribution program that
would expand and improve the distribution grid (34.5X; para. 2.36); tc) a
special program to renovate thermoeleutric power plants to improve thermal
efficiency and availability of CFE's main plants (25.0?; para. 2.38); and
(d) environmental and pollution control studies related with those
components (0.5?; paras. 3.13 and 3.14). CFE's total 1991-92 investment
program is described in Annex 3.4.0 and summarized belows
Generation Programs (53Z of the total cost). Complete
construction and place into operation 1227 MW in new power
plants and start construction of new power plants rated 4900
MW.
Transmission Program: (18X). Complete construction started in
previous years and start new construction of high voltage
transmission lines, substations and related facilities.
Included here is the special transmission program (para.
2.34) (10? of total cost) and a Study of the Environmental
Aspects of Transmission Lines and Substations (para. 3.13)
that the Bank loan would finance.



- 23 -
Distribution Programs (192). During the two-year period one
million new customers would be connected to the system; the
special distribution program is included (para. 2.36) (72 of
total cost).
Equipment Upgrading (8X). The purpose of this program is to
renew and upgrade existing installations, including
generation, transmission and distribution facilities, to
attain the performance and efficiency expected from each
component of the power system. Included is CFE's thermal
power plant renovation program (32 of total cost) described
in para. 2.38, and a Thermal Power Plant Pollution Control
Study (para. 3.14).
General Plant (22). Under this component are included the
facilities required for the operation of the company, such
as office buildings, vehicles, office equipment, etc.
Estimated cost
3.03      The total 1991-92 investment program, including physical and price
contingencies is estimated at USe6,711.4 million (current costs), of which
approximately 402 is foreign cost. Interest during construction and other
financial charges on loans (including the proposed Bank loan) amount to be
about US$416.0 million. Local cost estimates include approximately
US$576.0 million of identifiable taxes and duties. Detailed cost estimates
are given in Annex 3.4.0 and are summarized below:

3.04     Project cost estimates were prepared by CFE's Economic and
Planning Management Unit and by each of the units in charge of the special
programs: Transmission Projects Management Unit. Distribution Projects
Management Unit and Thermoelectric Projects Management Unit; they are based
on engineering studies and lists of contracts and bills of materials
already prepared. Physical contingencies of 11 are included, and price
contingencies have been added to both foreign and local costs expressed in
US dollars, at an escalation rate based on price escalation projections
prepared by the Bank (November 10, 1989) and the IDB, equal to 3.52 p.a.
for the period 1989-1994; it has been assumed that the exchange rate will
be adjusted to reflect the difference between the internal inflation rate
and the evolution of external prices.
Financing Plan
3.05     At the request of CFE, the Bank is promoting among multilateral
and bilateral agencies the financing of the two-year investment program.
The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has committed to finance up to
US$300.0 million and already appraised the project under close coordination
with the Bank; other bilateral sources have been contacted by the Bank.
The proposed sources of funds for the program are the following:

including interest during construction and duties and taxes, are estimated
at US$7,127.4 million, of which US$3,100.0 million or 43Z would be foreign
currency. A Bank loan of US$450.0 million is proposed to finance 6.3Z of
the program (or 7.8Z excluding taxes, duties and reserved procurement
contracts). The IDB would finance US$300.0 million or 4.2? and bilateral
credits US$150.0 million or 2.1Z. The remaining would be financed from
internally-generated funds (55.7Z), Government transfers (2.8?), consumer

Legal Arrangements
3.07     The Borrower of the loan will be Nacional Financiera, S.N.C.
(NAFIN), a Government-owned national development agency, which will act as
the administrator of the loan; the Beneficiary of the loan will be CFE, who
will be responsible for the execution of the project. The total amount of
the loan. US$450.0 million, will be on-lent by NAFIN to CFE, at the same
conditions of the main Bank loan, except that (i) the subsidiary loan would
be denominated in US dtollars and (ii) NAFIN would charge a fee amounting to
102 of the interest charged by the Bank and an intermediary fee. CFE will
assume the US dollar to Mexican peso exchange and interest risks; NAFIN
will bear the US dollar to basket of currencies exchange risk. A condition
of loan effectiveness is the signature of a satisfactory subsidiary loan
agreement between NAFIN and CFE (para. 4.03 a)).
Project Implementation and Status of Preparation
3.08     CFE, the Beneficiary of the loan, will be in charge of the
execution of the project; it has the organization, expertise and staff
required for its successful implementation. CFE's central and regional
offices are completing final design for transmission lines and substations
for the majority of the works included in the project; no special problems
are expected for land and right-of-way acquisition. Most of the design for
the distribution works is standardized. For the renovation of thermo-
electric power plants, CFE has prepared plans for the overhaul of all the
plants included in the project. Bills of materials, list of contracts and
bidding documents for all works to be financed by the Bank anJ by IDB are
ready, however, there is a percentage of equipment, materials aid parts
that will be defined at a later stage, once project execution his been
started. CFE will be in charge of all stages of design and supervision of
construction and consultants would be required for the execution of the
studies included in the project; project execution will be done with CFE's
own construction or maintenance work-force (about 602) and using local
contractors (about 402). The execution of the contracts to be financed by
the Bank under the proposed project would be completed by June 30, 1993.
Procurement
3.09     Funds from the proposed Bank loan would finance the full cost
(para. 3.16) of approximately 35 contracct for the purchase of equipment
and materials related with the special programs for transmission and
distribution, and parts and equipment for the thermal power plant
renovation program. Contracts for equipment and materials with an
aggregate value of US$418.5 million, representing 932 of the loan amount,
would be awarded through international competitive bidding (ICB), in
agreement with Bank Procurement Guidelines. Highly specialized items of
equipmient not exceeding the equivalent of US$400,000 per contract and up to
an aggregate amount of US$8.0 million (representing 1.81 of the loan
amount) and which can be supplied by only a limited number of
manufacturers, would be procured through limited international bidding
(LIB) procedures acceptable to the Bank, requiring comparison and
evaluation of bids invited from potential suppliers from at least three
different eligible countries. Hiscellaneous goods costing the equivalent
of US$50,000 or less, up to an aggregate amount equivalent to US$2.0
million (or 0.5 of the loan) would be procured through international
shopping procedures requiring price quotations from at least three
suppliers from at least two eligible foreign countries. Spare parts needed



- 26 -
for the rehabilitation of proprietary existing equipment under the thermal
plant renovation program, with an aggregate estimated value of US$20.0
million equivalent (representing about 4.42 of the loan smount). would be
acquired through direct purchasing, when such parts are only obtainable
from one single source. Consultants under the project would be retained in
accordance with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Prior review
by the Bank of procurement documentation would be required for all ICB
contracts as well as for the first two contracts to be awarded through each
of the LIB, international shopping and direct contracting procedures, and
would represent about 972 of the total loan amount. Agreement on
standardized procurement documents has been reached with CFE.
3.10     About 112 of the cost of the project (US$800 million), including
work contracts and goods manufactured locally would be procured from local
sources and is considered reserved procurement: this was deducted from the
total cost of the project in order to determine the amount of the proposed
Bank loan. Equipment and services financed with local funds (512) would be
procured throughl local competitive bidding with certain requirements on
integration of local manufacturing: equipment financed with suppliers'
credits (251) would be procured through international bidding with
financing requirements. Funds from the EXIMBANK of Japan (22) would
finance goods and services procured internationally without source limits.
These procurement methods, although still not fully open to international
markets, would preserve the principles of economy and efficiency in the
execution of the project.
3.11     The following table summarizes procurement arrangements for the
entire two-year investment program including the special programs to be
financed by the Bank; details are shown in Annex 3.4.3.

Environment
3.12     Under the conditions of Loan 3083-ME that finances the
Hydroelectric Development Project. CFE is committed to strengthen the
Central Unit for Social and Environmental Affairs and the four regional
units through the provision of personnel, training programs including
manuals and procedures, and purchase of equipment. The Bank will continue
supervising the compliance with such commitment, including the
centralization of all environmental and resettlement policy activities,
away from the powerful Construction and Operation Directorates, into a
single unit that would work coherently on all environmental and
resettlement aspects of CFE operations and would maintain close liaison
with external agencies such as SEDUE, INAH, the Institute of Anthropology,
the Institute of Biology, etc.; the actual work for specific projects such
as hydroelectric power plants, thermoelectric plants. etc., would be
carried out by local teams, with the overall supervision of the central
unit.
3.13     At present the execution of the transmission and distribution
programs do not present any special environmental problems and people would
not be displaced or affected negatively by the project. However,
considering that CFE's Ten-year Investment Program includes large additions
of transmission lines and substations, many in congested urban areas, the
proposed project has a component for the execution of a Study of the
Environmental Aspects of Transmission Lines and Substations, to consider
(a) rights-of-way issues, (b) possible future resettlements, (c) effects on
human health, (d) the effects of the use of fire and biocides to maintain
rights-of-way, and (e) CFE's organizational aspects and design of a
training component on the subject for CFE's and SEDUE's personnel. The
cost of the study is estimated at US$1.0 million.
3.14     An area of extreme concern to the Government and the Bank is the
control of pollution in the main urban centers; the Bank is supporting this
initiative through technical assistance and preparation of a project, to be
submitted to the Board soon, to address the pollution caused by
transportation in the Mexico City metropolitan area. The burning of fuel
at some of CFE's thermoelectric power plants contributes to the pollution
problem in Mexico City and the proposed operation includes the execution of
a country-wide Thermal Power Plant Pollution Control Study that would: (a)
determine the nature and extent of present level of pollution caused by
thermal power plants to air, land, and water; (b) perform technical and
economical analysis of alternative means to reduce pollution and effluents
from thermal plants to permissible levels; (c) recommend measures to be
adopted; and (d) include a training program for CFE and SEDUE staff on the
subject. The cost of the study is estimated at US$1.0 million.
3.15     During negotiations, agreements were reached with CFE on (i) the
initiation by September 30, 1990 and completion by September 30, 1991, of
the above studies, with the assistance of consultants and under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Government and to the Bank; (ii) the exchange
of views with the Bank, not later than December 31, 1991 on the conclusions
and recommendations of the studies, and on a plan of action, satisfactory
to the Government and the Bank to implement such recommendations, including
a timetable for implementation; and (iii) the commitment to implement such
plan of action in accordance with such timetable (para. 4.01 e)).



- 28 -
Disbursements
3.16     Proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would finance (a) 100Z of the
CIF cost of contracts for goods with foreign suppliers and 10O ex-factory
cost with local suppliers, and (b) 1002 of the cost of consultants required
for the execution of studies (see Annex 3.4.5). In-land transportation and
local taxes would be covered by CFE.
3.17     The loan would finance part of the requirements of the 1991-92
program; most of the contracts would be placed in 1990 and 1991 and
delivery completed by 1992. The Bank's standard disbursement profile would
not be observed as this is a two-year time-slice project; it has been
assumed that the loan would be disbursed over a period of three and a-half
years, to permit liquidation of the contracts and payment of the invoices
presented at the end of the two year period. The loan would be closed on
December 31, 1993 (see Annex 3.4.4). Retroactive financing in an aggregate
amount of up to US$20.0 million is proposed for any of the Bank-financed
contracts awarded under ICB after July 15, 1989. A Special Account would
be established with a limit of US$50.0 million, equivalent to about four
months of average disbursements. Statements of Expenditure would be used
for eligible expenditures for contracts valued at less than US$500,000
equivalent and documentation would be retained by NAFIN and would be made
available for periodic inspection by Bank staff; all other disbursements
would be fully documented. NAPIN would establish the Special Account,
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank (para. 4.01 f)).
3.18     In order to ensure that the commitments under the Hydroelectric
Development Project and under the proposed project are being implemented, a
condition of loan effectiveness is that CFE, NAFIN and the Government have
made progress satisfactory to the Bank in the implementation of all their
commitments under Loan 3083-ME, including the observance of the FRA and the
execution of the studies (para. 4.03 b)).
Auditing
3.19     As required by Mexican legislation for all state companies, CFE
has its financial statements audited by a firm of qualified independent
auditors approved by the General Comptroller's Office. At present such
firm is Despacho Roberto Casas Alatriste, Contadores Publicos, which acts
as correspondent of Coopers & Lybrand, an international independent audit
firm. During project execution, and as agreed under the Hydroelectric
Development Project, CFE will continue to engage the services of
independent and qualified auditors and shall present in accordance with
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank duly audited financial statements
and project account within six months of the close of the fiscal year.
NAFIN would agree to implement controls for the management of the Special
Account, and to engage independent and qualified auditors to audit the
accounting of the project, including the Special Account (para. 4.01 f)).
Performance Indicators
3.20     The goals for improvements in the operational performance of CFE
are set in the Financial Rehabilitation Agreement of August, 1989 (Annexes
2.7.0 and 3.6.0); the Government and CFE are committed, under Loan 3083-ME,
to comply with such goals.



- 29 -
Risks
3.21     The main risk would arise from CFE's failure to continue
increasing electricity rates, which would affect sector finances and result
in a shortage of local counterpart funds and in project execution delays.
However, the Government appears to be firm in its price policy reforms and
has shown strong evidence of its commitment as reflected by the 5.51
increase in real terms in 1989; in this context, the recent extension to
the economic pact signals the end to a long period oi price freeze,
shifting instead to a more predictable and continuous process of regular
public sector price adjustments. Another concern is the lack of access to
external financing in the amounts required, to meet which the Bank would
play an active role in putting together a cofinancing package. The project
does not pose special technical or environmental problems.
Economic Justification
3.22     The proposed 1991-1992 time slice to be financed by the Bank is
part of CFE's Ten-year Investment Program, which has been designed
following least-cost principles. The three special programs that the
proposed loan would finance include components that, in addition to
preventing an energy shortage to consumers and improving the quality and
reliability of CFE's power system, have important economic benefits, as
described in Annexes 3.1.0, 3.2.0 and 3.3.0.
3.23     In accordance with Bank guidelines, the internal rate of return
(IRR) of the total 1989-1998 Ten-year Investment Program was computed as
the discount rate equalizing the present values of the stream of costs and
benefits associated with it. The cost stream, expressed in 1989 constant
prices, includes: ti) the overall investment program (including
environmental and resettlement costs) and (ii) incremental operation and
maintenance costs, including fuel costs associated with the incremental
sales associated with the program. All inputs are priced at their
opportunity cost; taxes and internal transfers are excluded. As a proxy
for benefits, the revenues derived from incremental energy sales were
applied, at the retail rates considered in the FRA which entail reaching
long-run marginal costs by the year 1997. In addition, the economic rate
of return (ERR) was calculated as an attempt to reflect other benefits to
the economy, including consumer surplus and increased system reliability.
Annex 3.5.0 presents details of the economic analysis and sensitivity
tests. Based on the above assumptions, the internal rate of return (IRR)
for the proposed investment program is about 12Z and the economic rate of
return (ERR) is about 142. Sensitivity analyses show the rate of return to
be very sensitive to changes in electricity rates (ERR is about 122 if
rates are 10 lower, declining to 71 if rates ate nxot increased from the
1990 levels); if energy sales grow at only 5.O p.a. instead of 6.62 as
forecasted, the ERR would drop to 11. The ERR is not very sensitive to
capital cost increases (if costs are 11? higher, the 1RR would be 121) or
fuel cost increases (ERR would be 122 if fuel cost is 311 higher and is not
passed on to consumers).
3.24     The analysis confirms the economic merits of the proposed
investment, provided that rates are set at levels in accordance with the
requizements of the FRA; in thie case, the rate of return on the investment
program would be above the estimated cost of capital in Mexico
(approximately 122).

TPANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Present Situation of the Energy Sector
'Introduction
1.       The development of the energy sector in Mexico is governed by
principles set in the 1917 Mexican Constitution and subsequent amendments.
Articles 26, 27, 28, 73 and 93 provide for the ownership of the State to
all natural resources of the country; generation, transmission,
commercialization and distribution of electricity is also the resort of the
State. Article 27 specifies that the State should not grant neither
concessions nor exploration and production contracts on the hydrocarbon and
radioactive mineral resources; for this reason, the State has assumed the
sole responsibility to develop and exploit all natural resources.
Organization and Regulations
2.       Secretaria de Energia, Minas e Industria Paraestatal, SEMIP, is
the government branch in charge of coordinating energy planning and
developing activities throughout the energy sector, which is composed by
two public enterprises: (a) CFE and its subsidiary CLFC for electric power
generation, transmission, distribution, and marketing; and (b) PEMEX for
hydrocarbons exploration, production, transport, refining and basic
petrochemicals. In addition, the semi-public enterprise, MICARE, which is
under the umbrella of the Under-Secretary of Mines and Basic Industries of
SEMIP, is in charge of coal prospection and exploitation; CFE is a
shareholder in this company.
3.       Three specialized research institutes provide technical assistance
to the energy sector: (i) Instituto de Investigaciones Electricas (IIE);
(ii) Instituto Mexicano de Petroleo (IMP); and (iii) Instituto Nacional de
Investigaciones Nucleares (ININ); they provide the necessary technical and
technological support to the various public enterprises in the field of
petroleum, electricity and nuclear energy.
4.       Above enterprises and institutions are regulated by specific laws
and are under the jurisdiction of SEMIP and steered by independent
administrative councils (Juntas de Gobierno, Juntas Directivas or Consejos
Administrativos) which are the governing body with overall corporate
responsibility for the enterprise or the research institute. In the case
of hydrocarbons, the Law of August 24, 1959 regulates all the activities of
the sub-sector, while the Organic Law of July 25, 1972 defines the statutes
of PEMEX. In the case of power, the General Law of the Electric Service as
amended in 1983 defines the statutes of CFE. A general law of January
1983, regulates all the decentralized organisms and enterprises where the
State is shareholder. Annex 2.1.3 presents a schematic organization chart
of the energy sector in Mexico.

The HYdrocarbon Sub-sector
5.       Petr6leos Mexicanos - PEMEX.  Oil exploration started in Mexico in
1876 by the initiative of private foreign enterprises. The President of
Mexico L4zaro Cardenas created PEMEX by Presidential decree in June 7,
1938, as a decentralized public organism, after he expropriated in March
18, 1938 all the foreign oil companies. PEMEX has a Board of Directors in
charge of the overall corporate affairs of the company; it is composed of
11 members: six ministers designated by the Federal Government and five
members designated by the Trade Union (Sindicato de Trabajadores Petroleros
de la Republica Mexicana). The Federal Government designates the Chairman
and Vice Chairman and nominates the General Director as a chief executive
officer of the company as well as all the 7 Vice Presidents
(Subdirectores). PEMEX is the largest state enterprise in Mexico; in 1987
it employed 91,760 permanenc employees and 86,985 temporaries. a total of
178,745 persons. Its 1988 total sales amounted to 27,193 current billion
pesos (equivalent to US$ 11.8 billion). It owns and operates nine
refineries with an installed capacity of 1.9 million bbd and 21
petrochemical plants which manufacture more than 40 basic petrochemical
products. Annex 2.1.4 provides additional information on PEMEX.
6.       Instituto Mexicano de Petr6leos - IMP.  The Government founded IMP
in August 23, 1965, to foster the development of the technology required
for oil, chemical and petrochemical industries; it started its activities
on March 1966. DMP's basic functions fall within three major fields:
a)   Technology services to PEMEX and other oil companies, as well
as to the petrochemical and chemical industries;
b)   Research and development of new technologies for the oil and
petrochemical industries; and
c)   Training of personnel at all levels.
7.       IMP has an administrative council (Consejo Administrativo) formed
of 12 members: seven from PEMEX and five from various institutions. The
Chairman of the board is the General Director of PEMEX. IMP is ma:&aged by
a General Director and an Assistant General Director, both nominated by the
President of Mexico. IMP has a staff of about 4,140 persons of which about
1,900 are professionals. Since its creation, IMP has fulfilled its mission
in a successful way; it has responded to the need of the industry,
developing many new technologies and many patents which are used and
marketed in Mexico and abroad.
The Electric Power Sub-sector
8.       CFE and CLFC. The electricity service in Mexico is under the
responsibility of CFE and its subsidiary CLFC. CFE is responsible for
electric power systems planning, construction, operation and sales;
geothermal fields development and operation; and coal exploration.

Page 3 of 7
9.       Instituto de InvestiRaciones Electricas - IIE.  The IIE was
founded in December 1, 1975 by Presidential decree as a decentralized
public organism, to: (i) promote and execute research and development:
(ii) solve scientific and technological problems related to the improvement
and development of the electrical industry; (iii) contribute to the
dissemination and implementation of those technologies most suitable to the
country; and (iv) provide support and consulting services to CFE. IIE has
a Board of Directors (Junta Directiva) formed of 14 members supported by a
Technical Committee and a Research Advisory Council and is managed by an
Executive Director. It is composed of five main divisions which include
about 628 professionals. IIE has been quite successful in its mission.
10.      Minera Carbonifera Rio Escondido - MICARE.  MICARE  was founded on
August 2, 1977, with the purpose of exploiting the reserves of coal in
Mexico; the main shareholder is CFE (about 70Z of the capital) and other
minority shareholders include the Comisi6n de Fomento 4inero, NAFIN, and
two steel mills. The purpose of the company is to explore, develop,
exploit, and market coal deposits in the country; in 1988 approximately 4.2
million tons of coal were exploited by MICARE. The total number of
employees is 4,500, of which, approximately 350 have a professional degree.
11.      Instituto Nacional de Investiaaciones Nucleares - ININ.  This
institute was created in January 26, 1979, together with the now extinct
URAMEX (Uranio de Mexico), with the purpose of pursuing research and
development of nuclear technologies for pacific uses. Out of a total of
1,100 employees, about 400 hold professional degrees.
National Energy Policy and Sector Obiectives
12.      The National Energy Program prepared by the Ministry of Energy,
Mines and State Enterprises (SEMIP) and approved by the Government in
August, 1984 as part of the National Development Plan, presented an
analysis of the role of energy in country development, the main problems
faced by the sector, and set general sectoral objectives and medium term
(1984-88) and longer term (to the year 2000) targets and strategies. The
broader sectoral objectives are: (i) meeting overall energy demand
including export of hydrocarbons; (ii) energy conservation, particularly in
the state-owned industries with emphasis on simple, inexpensive measures to
cut down irrational energy use; (iii) energy diversification away from the
current excessive reliance on hydrocarbons, towards greater use of
alternative primary energies such as hydroelectricity; and (iv) improving
the financial situation of sector enterprises, so as to achieve full cost
recovery.
13.      An updated National Energy Program, enacted as part of the new
National Development Plan of June, 1989, will carry-on the original broader
objectives of the energy program; energy conservation and environment are a
cornerstone of the whole program. Furthermore, the objective of meeting
overall energy demand with indigenous resources are replaced by a new and
more flexible concept of self-sufficiency, that takes into account economic
and strategic considerations. The main directions of the new National
Energy Policy include: (i) rationalization and control of the energy demand
through a comprehensive energy conservation policy and program and an



ANNEX 2.1.0
Page 4 of 7
efficient and balanced use of energy, (ii) reduction and gradual
elimination of the various subsidies through adequate pricing mechanisms
for petroleum products and sound tarification of electricity prices;
(iii) modernization of the energy institutions; and (iv) expansion and
strengthening of the country's energy infrastructure.
14.      Energy Sector Issues.  Energy diversification and conservation
objectives are still major issues of the energy sector that need to be
addressed. Other main issues of the energy sector ares
(a)  the programs designed to implement the energy diversification
policy during 1982-1988 did not reach their objectives even though
a concerted and a coordinated effort was undertaken by the various
public enterprises in charge of supplying energy to the country.
Mexico is still heavily dependent on hydrocarbons. This is partly
attributed to the lack of financial resources to execute the
various projects aimed to create new alternative energy sources
such as hydro and coal generated electricity, nuclear, geothermal;
(b)  the energy conservation effort was encouraging, but its results
were modest. A rational and comprehensive approach and more
political will on behalf of all government branches and public
enterprises are required to achieve the assigned targets; and
(c)  the deterioration of the environment in general and the pollution
in the Federal District caused by the use of poor quality fuels
are a major concern.
Energy Conservation
15.      Mexico has started programs to save energy more than 12 years ago.
However, according to SEMIP the results have been modest because of various
reasons, the most important being low petroleum product prices, based on
the apparent abundance of hydrocarbon resources, particularly for the
industrial and transport sectors. Low cost energy led the country to an
intensive and inefficient use of energy resources, particularly
hydrocarbons. The following table shows the evolution of the national
energy consumption by sector and by source of energy.

16.      As the industrial and transport sectors consume more than 72Z of
the energy, the focus of conservation will be directed to these sectors.
Above table shows the overwhelming role played by hydrocarbons in Mexico,
as it constitutes the largest source of energy.
17.      Between 1982 and 1987, energy conservation efforts have produced
energy savings in 1987 equivalent to 110,000 bbd plus an additional 40,000
bbd from reduced flaring of associated gas, compared to the National Energy
Program target of 200,000 bbd. Excluding the reduced flared gas, this
represents only 55? of the goal. The state enterprises under the
jurisdiction of SEMIP contributed 72.7? to this energy saving; the
transport sector contributed 15.5? and the public and commercial 11.82.
The National Energy Conservation Commission
18.      Because of the emphasis on energy conservation, the present
Government established a National Energy Conservation Commission under
SEMIP; it is composed of 9 members and presided by the Minister of Energy
(SEHIP), and includes representatives from SHCP, SPP, SCT, SEP, SECOFI,
SEDUE, and the Federal District. The Technical Secretariat of this
commission is headed ily a high level staff from SEMIP and the coordinator
is the S'ib-Secretary of Energy of SEMIP. When fully integrated by the end
of 1989, the Commission will have a staff of about 35 profcssionals, some
of which will be seconded by other public enterprises that have expertise
and experience in energy conservation. Furthermore, each state will set up
its own energy conservation commission which will include representatives
from the private sector. These state commissions will work in close
cooperation and coordination with the National Commission. The Commission
will be in charge of the execution of energy conservation and co-generation
studies being financed by the Bank under Loan 3083-ME (para. 2.12).

Natural Gas Utilization
19.      Most of Mexico's large proven natural gas reserves, are associated
with petroleum production: in 1988, about 85 X of the natural gas produced
was associated gas, up from 692 in 1980. The decline of non-associated gas
reserves during this period is due to fewer discoveries of natural gas
fields and/or reservoirs. Gas is distributed by PEMEX through two major gas
pipsline networks linked by a trunk line Nuevo Teapa-Pajarito in the South
to Los Ramones-San Fernando in the North along the East coast. The North
East system serves the Northern part of the country and the Southern and
Central system the central areas.
20.      An intensive use of natural gas for power generation does not
appear possible at the present time, because available gas is limited due
to the reduction in oil production and the technical constraints to reduce
further the flared gas actually burned. In 1988, total natural gas
utilization amounted to about 3,431 million cubic feet per day - cfd, of
which PEMEX's self consumption before pipelines and after gas processing
plants was 1,394 million cfd or 40.2 Z; this includes use of natural gas as
a raw material for PEMEX's petrochemical operations. The volume of gas
delivered to the domestic market was equal to 1,116 million cfd
representing 32.1 Z of the total gas utilized. Shrinkage due to ethane and
other liquids extractions, losses and condensation in pipelines equal to
837 million cfd or about 24.3 2. Only 118 million cfd of gas are flared
representing 3.4 2 of the total in comparison of 12 2 in 1980; flared gas
is quite low by industry standards. Therefore, it appears that there is
not enough gas for power generation, unless new gas discoveries are made in
the future and/or oil production is increased significantly.
Petroleum Products Pricing
21.      Petroleum products prices in Mexico are fixed jointly by SHCP and
SEMIP in consultation with or at the request of PEMEX. The main focus in
the pricing mechanism is on the final consumer and not in production and
processing costs or refinery margin, and considers prevailing and
forecasted macroeconomic conditions of the country and often political
goals; under the Rules of the Federal Law for Public Enterprises
(*Reglamentos de la Ley Federal de Entidades Paraestatales*) enacted on
January 26, 1990, prices would be fixed considering the prices prevailing
in the international markets. Two types of taxes are included in the price
of fuels: the Value Added Tax (IVA) of 15Z on PEMEX price on all petroleum
products including natural gas and LPG and a tax called 'Impuesto Especial
Sobre Produccion y Serviciosu (IEPS) of 1222 on gasoline and diesel,
applied before IVA.
22.      The table below shows actual petroleum products prices including
taxes, and a comparison with their economic cost. Annex 2.1.2 presents
data on the evolution of fuel prices in Mexico.

TRASNMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
CFE: Institutional Aspects
Background and ownership
1.       CFE is a decentralized entity of the Mexican Government;
originally established by Presidential Decree in 1933, it started
operations in 1937. Although it was created with the objective of meeting
electricity demand in those areas that were not attractive for privately
owned utilities, the creation of CFE meant the initiation of a process of
total Government ownership of electric utilities which culminated in 1960.
Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution, as amended in 1960, grants to the
Government the exclusive right to provide electric power service in Mexico.
2.       CFE acquired the assets of American Foreign Power Company,
including the generation and distribution facilities of the most important
cities outside of Mexico City, including ten state capitals, and some
agricultural and industrial areas. CFE also acquired majority ownership of
the Mexican Light and Power Company (Mexlight), a Canadian electric utility
established in the 1890s. Mexlight installations were transferred to a
separate legal entity, Compaftla de Luz y Fuerza del Centro (CLFC). CLFC
exists as a separate public entity controlled by CFE and supplies electric
power purchased from CFE to Mexico City. CLFC is under a liquidation
process which is being carried out slowly, largely due to the labor
problems which might be caus2d by the integration of CLFC's organization
into CFE, as the companies '.ave different unions and their contracts
provide for different benelits.
Relationship with the Government
3.       As a decentralized public agency, CFE is subject to the control of
the Federal Government through the Ministry of Energy, Mines and State
Enterprises (SEMIP). The annual budget of CFE is submitted to the Ministry
of Planning and Budget (SPP) for its review and inclusion in the Federal
Budget which is subject to approval by the House of Representatives.
Electricity tariffs, as most public sector prices, are determined by a unit
under the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) based on requests
presented by CFE and on macroeconomic conditions.
Organization
4.       As established by the Electric Energy Public Service Law, amended
in December 1983, CFE has an Administrative Council (Junta de Gobierno) as
the governing unit in its organizational structure, with overall corporate
responsibility for company policy and supervision of its overall corporate
affairs (Annex 2.2.1). Its Chairman is the Minister of SEMIP and its other
members are the Ministers of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP); Agriculture
and Hydro Resources (SARH); and Planning and Budget (SPP); the General
Director of the State Oil Company (PEMEX); and three labor delegates. A
Supervisory Council has three members representing the Federal Comptroller,
SEMIP and the Administrative Council. The General Director is the Chief
Executive Officer of the company. The Directors of Construction,



44                          ANNEX 2.2.0
Page 2 of 6
Operations and Administration report directly to him as well as the
Comptroller and the heads of Finance, Legal Department and Social
Communications. For each one of its functional areaq, the company is
divided into different geographical regions; the management of these areas
have limited autonomy as most of the major decisior.s are taken at
headquarters. CFE's organization is adequate for a company with its
characteristics but a system of decentralized authority, giving the
regional offices a greater degree of autonomy, needs to be established.
The management study, agreed under Loan 3083-ME, includes the reviewing
and analysis of CFE's current organization in order to define a
decentralization system to be applied in the short, medium and long term,
establishing clear objectives and responsibilities at each management
level.
Management
5.       CFE is well managed, considering its size and the market it
serves. It has qualified and competent managers and an adequate management
information system. In the past, the particular conditions created by
Mexican culture and economy, characterized by a significant concentration
of power in the Federal Government and by using the state owned companies
to foster the macroeconomic and social objectives of the Government (such
as employment targets and promotion of local industry), have placed some
constraints on management which, however, have not resulted in costs that
are out of line with international standards. A feature common to Mexican
state-owned companies is the significant participation of labor
representatives in the decision making process; at CFE they are members of
the Administrative Council and other collegiate bodies in the organization.
Their participation has allowed smooth labor relations within the company
since the union has taken the company's objectives as their own. The
management study, agreed under Loan 3083-ME, includes the reviewing and
analysis of CFE's management system (para. 4).
Staffing
6.       CFE's personnel policy is to promote the integral development of
its human resources in line with the development of the company. For this
purpose and within the general tradition established for Government-owned
entities in Mexico, labor relations are managed in close coordination
between the company and the labor union is reflected in a labor contract
which is renegotiated every two years. The one presently in force
constitutes, in fact, the personnel manual of the company as it sets the
policies and procedures for human resources administration.
7.       The sector is the second major employer in the country, after the
state oil company (PEMEX). The total number of staff as of December 1988,
was 120,887 employees of which 89,237 belonged to CFE and 31,650 to CLFC.
Out of the total sector employees, 68,500 operate the power system, 18,660
are contingent workers for major maintenance of power plants and
transmission and distribution installations, and 33,727 are temporary
workers in the construction force. The evolution of the power sector staff
since 1982 is shown in Annex 2.2.1. The number of operating employees in
the power sector (excluding the construction area) has increased more
rapidly than the expansion of e.iectricity supply in Mexico, as shown in the
following table:

8.       The Government recognizing the problem of overstaffing has limited
the hiring of new staff (Annex 2.7.0) and, under the management study, CFE
will develop a program to establish new human resource policies.
Training
9.       CFE has a comprehensive training program and adequate facilities
to implement it. A Central Unit for Training and Development establishes
the basic norms, plans, organization, evaluation and coordination of the
program to be applied at a national level and it implements the training
activities for the headquarters personnel. Fourteen regional distribution
units (including CLFC) are in charge of regional training centers and the
implementation of their corresponding activities. The training activities
cover all aspects of CFE's operations, including engineering and design,
operation and maintenance, safety, public and community relations, finances
and administration and general education. In 1988, about 61,200 employees
participated in 7,173 courses and seminars, with an average attendance of
about seven hours per participant. The total cost of the 1988 program was
Mex$12.5 billion (US$5.5 million).
10.      CFE is developing a detailed plan to improve training management,
which includes the acquisition of personal computers and hardware and
software to implement the automation of training activity information.
Computing Systems
11.      The data processing unit, located in the Mexico City headquarters,
operates CFE's information systems related to the national offices and
assists and monitors the regional offices in creating and implementing the
norms and procedures of the company regarding data processing. The
objectives of CFE's computerized information system are to establish: (a) a
network of local and regional computer systems; (b) a system master plan
with operational and strategic components; and (c) a quality control
program. During the next five years, the following projects are expected
to be implemented: (i) complete the computerized billing and collection
system by connecting small isolated localities and by consolidating the
information on a regional basis; (ii) set up an inventories system, under
national norms and procedures, which would allow a better administration
and control of stocks; (iii) integrate the accounting and budget
information of the company; and (iv) set up administration and control of
human resources. Parallel to these projects, there is a plan for the
acquisition of the equipment required for their adequate implementation.

Accountint and Auditina
12.      CFE's accounting unit is under the Deputy Comptroller who reports
to the Comptroller. The company's accounting system reflects the
institutional objective of delegation of functions to the regional offices.
This objective is in the process of being achieved by delegating more
functions to the regional offices and leaving the consolidation of the
accounting information, the registration of entries for the national
offices and the establishment of norms and procedures for functions in
general for the central unit at headquarters. Many of the new systems are
being incorporated under the data processing projects now under execution
(para. 11).
13.      CFE has a system of accounts that consists of a computer listing
with a detailed description of each account. The external auditor report
for the 1988 financial statements shows that some deficiencies exist both
in the accounting system and in the internal control system. These
deficiencies notwithstanding, the company issues reliable monthly financial
statements within thirty days. The following subjects need to be assessed:
(a) the valuation of CFE's assets, as (i) CFE's assets may be overvalued as
the revaluation index that has been used has exceeded the consumer price
index for several years, (ii) the depreciation quota (2.52) seems to be low
for a power utility with 762 of thermal generation, and (iii) all interest
is charged to income, and no charge for interest during construction is
made; (b) the treatment of the "aprovechamiento' (interest saving on CFE's
debt converted into Government equity) as a method of calculation and
accounting registration is not in line with the definition stated in the
public service law for power utilities, chapter IX, article 46; and (c)
the accounting registration of subsidies received from the Government. The
management study agreed under Loan 3083-ME (para. 23) includes the review
of the valuation of CFE's assets, and the treatment of the
'aprovechamiento' and accounting registration of subsidies are under review
by CFE to be incorporated in CFE's books at the end of the current fiscal
year.
14.      The internal audit unit of CPE also reports to the Comptroller.
It has regional units assigned to the operations divisions and to the
construction coordinating units. The central unit establishes the norms
and procedures for auditing within the company and monitors their adequate
implementation. CFE, by law, has to engage the services of external
auditors registered under the country's General Comptroller Office. At
present such a firm is Despacho Roberto Casas Alatriste, Contadores
Publicos, which acts as correspondent of Coopers & Lybrand, an
international independent audit firm. Both firms are acceptable to the
Bank. During project execution, CFE will engage the services of
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and will present, in accordance
with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, duly audited financial
statements, project accounts and statements of expenditures related to the
project within six months after the end of each year. In addition, the
Special Account to be opened under the Bank loan will also be audited in
accordance with terms of reference and by an auditing firm, both acceptable
to the Bank.

Budgeting and Planning
15.      As a Government-owned entity, CFE follows the general principles
of fiscal budgeting established by the Mexican Government which is
basically a cash budget. The unit in charge of budget preparation is under
the Finance Department while the unit in charge of budget control is under
the Comptroller. The company has a coherent management information and
control system. Besides budget preparation, the Budget Department is
basically in charge of the accounts payable system. Financial projections
are prepared by the Economic and Planning Studies Unit under the
Construction Directorate, which is in charge of the medium and long-term
planning of the company. They also prepare the sales forecast and the
long-term investment program of the company, based on least cost
principles.
Procurement and Inventories
16.      CFE is subject to national legislation dealing with procurement of
goods and services following Government directives. In the past, CFE
restricted its sources to national suppliers, and permitted international
competition only when no Mexican manufacturers existed. However, since
Mexico joined GATT in 1986, public entities, including CFE, have been
slowly opening their market to international competition. Under Bank's
Loan 3083-ME and under present and possible future operations, all
procurement shall be made under international competitive bidding.
17.      CFE's purchases are made by the Technical Services Unit (civil
works) and the Supplies Unit (goods) and the regional offices which are
authorized to mLke small and medium purchases. The size and complexity of
the enterprise have resulted in a list of about 400,000 items purchased by
CFE. To safeguard and handle these items, CFE has 486 warehouses which at
the end of September 1989 had a stock of about USS1,500 million, of which
about 29Z was for operation and m-aintenance and 71Z for construction. As
opposed to the general philosophy of concentration that existed in the
company until 1985, the warehouses seem to have had excessive autonomy.
There are neither coordinated systems of inventory management nor clearly
defined policies regarding obsolescence. The company also lacks a clearly
defined nomenclature of goods which would support a well managed inventory
system and avoid unnecessary duplication of names. Preliminary efforts are
being made by CFE to implement a data processing system to provide the
necessary information for management decision. The problems outlined above
shall be reviewed under the management study financed by Bank loan 3083-ME.
Metering, Billing and Collection
18.      Billing and collection at CFE are well developed and successfully
carried out by the regional offices, with a good degree of coordination at
the national level. CFE is divided into 14 regional distribution
divisions, each division is divided into zones for a total of 100 and each
zone in agencies for a total of 850. CFE's billing and collection
procedure is highly computerized and is centralized in the regional
divisions while bill collection is made at each zone and agency. As a next
step in the deconcentration process, and with the intention of accelerating
the collection process, CFE plans to move the billing process to the zones.
In two areas, Baja California and Monterrey, customers with an installed
capacity of more than 25 kW (tariff 8) and customers at 66 kV and up



- 48 -                          ANNEX 2.2,0
Page 6 of 6
(tariff 12) are metered and billed at the same time, under a pilot program
that uses portable computerized billing equipment. The acquisition of
additional equipment for the rest of the country is included in the
proposed project.
19.      The collection system of CFE is reasonably efficient as the
collection period is about 60 days and the uncollectable accounts represent
only 0.l of total billing. An important factor for this achievement, rare
for Latin-American utilities, is a compensation mechanism operating under
the federal budget system for collecting from other public enterprises and
from Gover^-.ment agencies.
20.      The collection record of CFE seems to be under an initial process
of deterioration as many districts are falling behind. This deterioration
is due to the recent significant nominal tariff increases, especially in
those states where opposition parties have become stronger and represent an
important challenge to the Government party. Major problem related to
consumer billing is the lack of meters (about one million at present) due
to the financial constraints facing CFE. The proposed project focuses on
CFE's distribution needs, under which these problems will be addressed (see
Annex 3.2.0).
General Services
21.      The General Services Unit of CFE has, among other functions, the
responsibility for the air and land transportation systems of CFE. At
present, CFE has a fleet of eight airplanes which, in 1988, were 702 of the
time available for service, flew 1,230 hours and carried 5,105 passengers.
cFE has also a fleet of 20 helicopters, of which, in 1988, only 14 were in
service and flew 5,145 hours transporting about 1,764 tons and 13,731
passengers. This service warrants an in-depth assessment regarding its
economic convenience as compared with procuring it from private companies.
The financial constraints encountered by the company have resulted in the
aging of the existing fleet which has reached an average of eight years.
This and the normative matters regarding land transportation shall be
reviewed under the management study carried out under loan 3083-ME.
Insurance
22.      Existing policies cover only transportation, fire and vehicles,
but do not include plant breakdown and damage to third parties, except for
the nuclear power plant. A policy of self insurance seems adequate for
certain assets such as distribution networks and transmission lines,
because of their large number and geographical dispersion, but should
require the establishment of a special fund as is usual utility practice.
CFE will review its insurance policy, under the management study financed
by Bank loan 3083-ME, in order to cover major installations such as power
plants, substations, distributions centers and building against all risk
including fire, explosion, terrorism, vandalism, floods, earthquakes, etc.

4ISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
FE's Power System and Market
Power SYstE
1.       Cl             ;e of the planning, development and operation of the
public pow&              em for the entire country.  Since the service area
is extensi'           .,tely 2.0 million km2), and the power system large
(23,900 MW         A capacity), CFE has divided its activities by
geographic      ,ions.  Corporate planning and the design and engineering
for large   ,jects are carried out at headquarters in Mexico City;
construction and operation are performed by the following regions, which
operate with a limited degree of autonomy from the central offices:
Hydroelectric power plants                     5 regions
Thermoelectric power plants                    5 regions
Transmission systems                           7 regions
Distribution networks                          14 regions
2.       The Central distribution region, where Mexico City is located,
accounts for 252 of all energy consumption. Except for the Yucatan and
Baja California areas, most of the country is interconnected through high
voltage transmission lines (400 kV and 230 kV), forming the National
Interconnected System (Sistema Interconectado Nacional - SIN). There are
however. power transmission limitations in the interconnection among
regions that do not allow the full exchange of power plant reserve. CFE
has decided to reinforce the interconnection, when justified, but when
large distances are involved, it is more economical to add more generating
capacity than to invest in transmission facilities.
3.       At the end of 1988, CFE had a total installed capacity of
23,921 MW, 56,000 Km of high voltage transmission lines (115 kV, 230 kV and
400 kV), 255,000 Km of distribution lines and 16,500 MVA of distribution
transformers through which about 50Z of electric energy is sold, the rest
is sold at high voltage&. Annex 2.3.1 shows the evolution of CFE's system
in the past, and Annex 2.3.2 the existing power plants as of December 31,
1988.
Operation of CFE's Power System
4.       The National Center for Energy Control (Centro Nacional de Control
de Energia, CENACE), which operates under CFE's Director of Operations, is
charged with the control of the operations of the power system, including
the control of fuel supply for the thermal plants and water reservoir level
for hydroplants. The system is operated considering service reliability,
economy of operation and quality of service (voltage level). The structure
of CENACE includes a Central Control Group (Centro Nacional de Control,
CNC), which counts with modern facilities such as a real-time computerized
central load dispatch center and off-line programming facilities to



- 52 -                        ANNEX 2.3.0
Page 2 of 4
determine short-term (daily and weekly) planning or medium- and long-term
analysis for the operation of the system under normal and emergency
conditions. There are also six regional control centers (Centros de
Control de Area, CCA), in charge of the operation of their respective
areas. They also have modern facilities, including computer installations,
remote terminals at main power plants and substations, etc.
Demand Forecast
5.       CFE developed a global econometric model to forecast electricity
demand; the model relates electricity consumption with population, gross
public investment and GDP. The demand forecast on which the Investment
Program is based, was determined by CFE (Annex 2.3.5) based on aggregation
of short- and medium-term demand forecasts made by the distribution regions
and a long-term global forecast made with the help of the above aggregate
model. The forecasts prepared at regional level, usually covering up to
five years, consider expected growth by class of consumers, and take into
account special industrial and commercial loads requested to CFE. For the
decade 1988-98, sales (including exports) are forecasted to grow at 6.62 as
compared to 6.4? of the 1978-88 period, assuming that population will grow
at an average of 2.162 during the period, public investment at 8.72 in real
terms and GDP at 5.1Z.
6.       Subsequent to the evaluation of the project by the Bank in July of
1989, CFE continued to evaluate the power market concluding that higher
electricity sale growths could be expected in the next decade, considering
the high demand growth being experienced in 1989 (close to 9? average) and
the fast economic recovery of the country called for under the new National
Development Plan. Under this assumption, CFE is preparing a new Ten-year
Investment Program with more intensive investments that could provide
additional generation, transmission, and distribution capacity to serve the
power market without detriment to the quality of service. Under the terms
of Loan 3083-ME, the Bank will monitor closely the development of the power
market and any proposed changes to the Ten-year Investment Program; it
should be mentioned that if in fact demand grows at a faster rate and
investments in the power sector are not increased, the reserve margins of
power generation and other installations would decrease to dangerous levels
deteriorating reliability of supply and leading to rationing.
7.       Two additional scenarios were analyzed by CFEs a low growth
scenario (Annex 2.3.5) assumes a growth for GDP of 3.8? and a growht of
7.0? for public investment for the period, Lesulting in an electricity
demand growth of 5.7?; another scenario conj;'-ers null growth for public
investment and GDP, resulting in a 4.2? electricity demand growth.
8.       The Bank examined CFE's global econometric model, concluding that
improvements are required to (a) forecast demand by customer class, (b)
include electricity pricing and income as explanatory variables, and (c)
consider the effect of prices of substitute fuels. Alternative demand
models prepared by the Bank, based on regression analysis, attempt to
address some of these limitations. Sensitivity analysis carried out using
these models (sca-.arios Bank-A and Bank-B) suggests that, if the tariff
adjustments are carried out as planned, demand could grow less than
predicted by CFE.

10.      For corporate planning purposes, CFE decided to base its
investment program on the higher demand forecast (Scenario POISE), as this
would require higher investments; any necessary corrections to the
expansion program could be easily introduced to adapt to other demand
growth, by altering the commissioning dates of thermo-electric power
plants, which require short lead times. The Bank agreed with this approach
as CFE is committed, under the Hydroelectric Development Project (Loan
3083-ME), to review annually the demand forecast considering prevailing
market and economic conditions; any resulting modifications to the Ten-year
Investment Plan will be presented to the Bank by September 30 of each year.
In addition, the Bank is collaborating with CFE in the development of an
improved forecasting methodology that would strengthen CFE's planning
capability.

Energy and Capacity Balances
11.      The generation expansion program for the period 1989-98 includes
the construction of a total of 17,626 MW in new power plants, of which
3,207 MW (182) are hydro (see Annex 2.3.3). Energy and capacity balances
(Annexes 2.3.6 and 2.3.7) prepared for the CFE's global system, consider
the above program, and take into account existing energy transfer
restrictions among regions due to limitations in the transmission systems
or the lack of interconnection (para 2 above), restrictions during the
testing period of new generating plants and restrictions in hydro plants
due to priority use of water for irrigation and water supply to urban
centers. It is considered that the availability of thermal plants, which
was very low in the past, will gradually improve to industry standards
(Annex 2.3.4).

*team, coal-fired stem,  eothermal steam and combined cycle.
!/ Typical range for well run utillties.
$J   Tula started operation In 1975 and Is typical of some of
CFE's power plants, whose maintenance In the past was
neglected due to excessiv, service (because of capacity
shortage) and lack of parts (because of fiscal restrictions);
Tula, ITke many other similar plants, has now a well
structured rehabilitation plan.
M danzanillo started operation In 1981 and Is typical of the
new CFE's type of power plants, which are well designed,
operated and maintained.
!/   Net availability, excluding scheduled maintenance and forced
outages.

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Power Sector Investment Program
Investments in the Power Sector: a Retros2ective View
1.       In the past, investments in the power sector were sizable as
compared to gross public investment (GPI)s in the decade of the oil boom of
the 70's, CFE's investment were an average of 132 of GPI; in 1982, CFE's
investments reached about US$2.0 billion (1989 constant currency) or 9.5Z
of GPI, but then they declined to about US$1.2 billion in 1986 and 1987,
and US$1.4 billion in 1988, reflecting restrictions imposed by the
Goverwment because of macroeconomic conditions (see Annex 2.4.1). The
investment restrictions of the last five years did not permit CFE to carry
out a least cost investment program, but rather a program in which
hydroelectric and other non oil-based projects were postponed and
investments in power plant maintenance and upgrading and transmission and
distribution networks were restricted to minimum levels; these restrictions
have not yet caused measurable negative effects to the quality of service.
but if not corrected through adequate investment, may bring serious
problems to the power sector, among others: decrease of power plant
reserves, increase of energy losses, decrease of thermal power plant
availability and efficiency, etc. This, in turn, would affect the
reliability of service, which is of particular importance to industry.
Future Investments
2.       CFE has developed computer models to analyze the expansion
programs for generation and transmission facilities and determine a least
cost investment program. Based on yearly reviews of the power market
projections and considering border prices, CFE determines a Ten-year
Investment Program for the Power Sector (Programa de Obras e Inversiones
del Sector Electrico, POISE). The models reflect the state of the art in
planning methodology. However, adjustment in CFE's planning procedures are
needed in order to improve CFE's selection of robust and economically sound
investment programs; for the purpose, the Bank has requested that CFEs
a.   subject proposed investment  sequences to greater variation in the
range of forecasted demand than in the past;
b.   plan expansion in generation and transmission, from the start,
according to least-cost principles under a budgetary constraint,
which amounts to consideration of higher opportunity cost of
capital reflecting the prevailing capital scarcity; alternative
expansion plans would be prepared with various discount rates, so
as to select that one which meets the available financial funds.
This approach avoids the possibility of selecting non-optimal
investments in the two-phase approach currently being used by CFE
(selection of least-cost program and subsequent introduction of
budgetary restrictions); and

Page 2 of 2
c.   adopt better distribution planning methodologies and techniques to
promote efficiency in distribution investment.
3.       The Government and CFE have agreed under the ongoing Hydroelectric
Development Project that CFE shall: (a) each year during implementation of
the Project, carry out a technical and economic analysis in order to update
the investments proposed to be made in the power sector under the Ten-year
Investment Program and shall, when making such analysis: (i) utilize least-
cost principles; (ii) utilize export prices for oil products; (iii)
consider all environmental and resettlement costs associated with making
such investments; and (iv) take into account financial restrictions on CFE
due to macroeconomic conditions. Each updated Ten-year Investment Program
shall include an updated financial projection to carry out the Plan, and an
economic justification of, and a viable financing plan for, major
generation installations not previously included in the Ten-year Investment
Program. CFE shall review with the Bank each updated plan, promptly after
completion; (b) execute only the installations included in the Ten-year
Investment Program; and (c) by September 30 of each year during
implementation of the project, and at the request of either the Bank or the
Government, review with the Bank and the Government. the progress in
carrying out the Ten-year Investment Program.
4.       The investment program presented in Annex 2.4.1 is not a true
least cost program, as it was modified to consider an investment ceiling
imposed by SPP for 1989 and 1990. However, it is the intention of CFE to
gradually shift the investment decisions to least cost principles; after
1991 no financial restrictions have been considered. As shown in the
annex, the proposed investment program considers a gradual recuperation of
the investment in the power sector as compared to the GPI, surpassing past
relative levels after 1991. If appropriate tariff policies are pursued,
the financial projections developed show that CFE would be able to finance
its investment requirements without financial assistance from the
Government. Any deviations from the least cost program required because of
macroeconomic reasons, would be discussed with the Bank at the time of the
annual review of the investment plan. Annex 2.4.2 presents graphically the
evolution of CFE's annual investments and the growth of the power market.
Optimization of CFE's Investments
5.       Under the Hydroelectric Development Project, CFE agreed to carry
out studies which will define required actions to improve the overall power
system efficiency and the optimization of investments. The first study
will consider the Optimization of the Operation of CFE's Electric Power
System, and determine recommendations regarding efficiency, reduction and
control of electric energy losses, etc. The second study, Co-Generation in
Mexico, to be carried out by SEMIP with the assistance of CFE, will
consider the possibilities of utilizing for public service part of the
2,290 MV privately owned in Mexico and possible incentives for new
investments in co-generation.

Electricity Pricing
Approval Process
1.       The General Law of Electricity Service establishes the procedure
for approving electricity tariffs. The Ministry of Finance (SHCP) sets
electricity tariffs, their adjustment or restructuring, after taking into
consideration the opinions of the Ministries of Planning and Budgeting
(SPP), Commerce and Industrial Development (SECOFI) and of Energy, Mines
and State Enterprises (SEMIP) and based on the proposal submitted by CFE.
Past Situation
2.       The average electricity rates in 1988 prices have deteriorated
progressively from 7.1 UScent per KWh in 1963 to 4.2 UScent per KWh in
1988. Since 1983, decrees have been issued by SHCP at the end of each
year, for tariff level adjustment during the following year, which included
a substantial increase in January and smaller fixed increases every month,
in order to keep up with the expected rate of inflation. However, since
often the rate of inflation was greater than expected, electricity rate
levels deteriorated in real terms; average rates including taxes (in 1988
UScents per kWh), were as follows: 1983: 3.8; 1984: 4.0; 1985 3.8: 1986:
4.5; 1987s 4.1; 1988: 4.2, and 1989: 4.6. Annex 2.5.3 shows the evolution
of the electricity rates during 1962-1989 and a projection for the period
1990-1996.
3.       Commercial rates declined from 11.3 UScent per KWh in 1962 to 5.6
in 1983, and since then they have been increased more than the remaining
rates, but are still below the 1978 levels. Industrial rates declined from
5.2 UScent per KWh in 1962 to a range between 3.0 and 3.9 during 1971 and
1985, and in 1986 reached 4.1 UScent per KWh, which has been maintained in
1988.   Residential rates have declined steadily from 11.7 UScent per KWh
in 1962 to 3.9 in 1988 (3 times below the 1962 level). Agricultural rates
also declined until 1983 (11 times below the 1962 level), and then have
increased steadily to reach 1.0 UScent per KWh in 1988.
Current Situation
4.       Electricity rates have been subsidized by the Government since the
70s. In 1986, operating revenues covered operating costs and left a
positive margin of 6.2Z because fuel costs were subsidized by the
Government (set at a level of about 652 of international prices). It was
then estimated that fuel subsidies plus government contributions to CFE
amounted to about 1.12 of GDP and, consequently contributed significantly
to the fiscal deficit, which was then 15.6Z of GDP. The Government and
CFE, aware of the deterioration of the electricity rates committed
themselves to a sounder policy under targets included in the sector's
Financial Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA) signed in August 1986 ani renewed



- 67 -                        ANNEX 2.5.0
Page 2 of 3
in August 1989 (Annex 2.7.0). During negotiations, commitment was assured
from the Government and CFE to modify the present electricity rate
structure with the purpose of promoting efficiency in the use of
electricity and reducing cross subsidies among customers.
5.       The present tariff structure does not reflect the costs of
supplying electricity to each customer category. The appropriate basis for
electricity pricing is to set tariffs according to marginal costs; the
rough estimates prepared during appraisal, shown in the table below,
suggest that the average rates per category are below marginal costs,
except for industrial and commercial customers, who are paying close to
their costs of supply. On average, the increase in rates necessary to
reach marginal costs amounts to 322 in real terms.

Forecast
6.       Electricity rates have been projected to reach the long-run
marginal cost level by 1996. In 1989, average tariffs were increased in
about 12.2Z in real terms. These tariff increases, which were implemented
when prices and wages were frozen, were applied on residential customers
with a monthly consumption over 200 kWh (2002), water supply and sewerage
consumers (102) and public lighting services (1002) (Annex 2.5.1). Rate
increases of about 5.5s are expected in 1990, and 8.8? in 1992. Further
rate increases will be required in subsequent years to reach a 72 of rate
of return.
Tariff Study
7.       During 1986, CFE carried out the first phase of a tariff study
based on marginal costs for high voltage consumers (69 kV and higher
voltage). This work, perforned with the technical assistance of ENDESA,
the national electric utility of Chile and with IDB financing, has been
adjusted and updated in a continuous process by CFE staff. At present, CFE



- 68 -                       ANNEX 2.5.0
Page 3 of 3
is in the process of implementing the recommendations of the study, for
example, hourly metering equipment for most of the existing high voltage
clients (type 8 and 12 of consumers) has been installed. As stated in the
new FRA (Annex 2.7.0), by 1990, time-of-day tariff will be applied to the
263 customers of tariff 12 (consuming about 272 of energy sales). It is
expected that by 1992, most of the industrial customers with demands higher
than 1,000 kW (about 1.200 customers), consuming about 47Z of CFE's energy
sales, would be incorporated to the program. CFE has started a public
relations campaign to convince major consumers on the advantages of the
tariff scheme based on marginal costs.
8.       The second phase of the tariff study, to be carried out under the
Hydroelectric Development Project (Loan 3083-ME), will cover the medium
voltage tariffs for the remaining main consumers; it will also include some
analysis and follow-up of the first phase, and the purchase of metering and
data processing equipment required for the execution of the studies. This
study is to be completed by June 30, 1991. CFE has agreed to exchange
views with the Bank on the conclusions and recommendations and provide a
satisfactory action plan to the Government and to the Bank, including a
timetable for implementation of the recommendations, not later than
December 31, 1991.
9.       The agreed terms of reference for the execution of the tariff
study to be conducted by consultants, under Loan 3083-ME, are the
following:
a)   Assess the current situation on tariffs, costs, typical load
curves, losses, shift-working, seasonal patterns, reserve margins
and the status on the marginal cost study carried out by CFE;
b)   Prepare referencial parameters related to losses, load diversity,
availability and efficiency of power plants. These parameters
shall be determined based on experiences in other countries and
taking into account the characteristic of CFE's power system;
c)   Assess the existing measurement sy-tem and recommend improvement
in order to establish new typical load curves, diversity factors,
energy and power losses factors for different seasonal work-
patterns, voltage levels and type of customers.
d)   Recommend a tariff structure based on marginal costs, including a
schedule to apply interruptible load tariffs and recommendations
to promote time-of-day rates.

TRANSHISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Sector Finances
General
1.       Since the early 70s, the Mexican power sector has been
experiencing financial difficulties, mainly as result of inadequate pricing
policies. Net internal funding was insufficient to cover the heavy burden
of debt service, requiring borrowings higher than the investment program
and resulting in an increasing dependency on external funds. From 1978,
the Government had to increase cash transfers to subsidize electricity
rates; in 1983, a sizable rate increase (1202) was offset by rising
inflation. In 1986, realizing that the measures taken were not sufficient
to solve the financial weaknesses of CFE, the Government and CFE signed a
Financial Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA) which included, among other
measures, the conversion of about US$8.6 billion of CFE's debt into
Government equity at CPE (see Annex 2.7.0). As this agreement expired in
December 31, 1988, a new FRA was signed on August, 1989, with the purpose
of further strengthening the rehabilitation of the sector's finances,
establishing updated targets and objectives. The sector's 1986-1996
consolidated financial statements are shown in Anunexes 2.6.1 to 2.6.3.
Income Statement
2.       CFE's rate of return decreased steadily from 1970 (8.8Z) until
1983 (-4.12), The low rate of return reached in that year, in spite of a
significant rate increase of about 1202 in nominal terms, is partly
explained because of the increases in other costs, particularly fuel oil
which increased by about 3001. During 1984-1986, the deteriorating trend
in the sector's finances reversed and positive rates of return were
achieved; however, in 1987 the rate of return became negative once again,
basically because the higher-than-expected inflation eroded the electricity
rate increases. Furthermore, the interest charges resulting from CFE's
heavy debt burden resulted in permanent losses for every single year since
1976.
3.       In December 1987, the Govprnment, in line with the provisions of
the FRA, authorized a hike of 852 average to electricity rates; this
increase allowed CFE to start to rehabilitate its finances. A positive
rate of return of 1.72 was achieved in 1988 and a rate of return of 2.42 is
estimated for 1989 as a result of the nominal tariff increases applied
mainly to industrial consumers (372) in December 1988, and to residential
customers (602), street lighting services (65Z), and water sewerage service
(10Z) in September 1989. As stated in the new FRA (see Annex 2.7.0),
further rate increases will be applied in 1990 and 1991 to reach 18.82
increase in real terms over the average rate of the first semester of 1989.
As a result of these planned rate increases, CFE would continue improving
the rate of return from 2.82 in :990 to 72 in 1996. Net income is also
expected to be positive starting in 1991 and to continue improving in
subsequent years.

To reach these results, electricity rates would have to be increased in
real terms on an average of 5.82 p.a., reaching the level close to long-run
marginal cost by 1996. Expected rate levels for the period (excluding 152
sales taxes), expressed in 1989 constant Mexican pesos and equivalent US
currency converted at the average exchange rate of 2.578 Mexican pesos per
one US dollar (average for 1989), are as follows:

3.       During the projection period, the most important component of the
operating costs would continue to be fuel costs which on average would
account for about 33Z of the revenues. The financial projections are based
on fuel prices projected by CFE assuming price hikes in real terms, to
reach Bank estimates. In 1989, residual oil (Bunker C) is expected to
account for about 642 of CFE's fuel bill; the price subsidies that still
remain would be eliminated by 1993. Diesel oil would account for 52 of
CFE's fuel bill, and has a price of about 362 above border prices. The
remaining 312 of CFE's current fuel bill is composed of gas and coal, which
are priced at or over border prices.
Flow of Funds
4.       Starting in 1971, the internal contribution to the investment
program was insufficient to cover the debt service and the investment
program, requiring borrowings higher than the investment program, and an
increasing dependency on external funding. This situation was alleviated
in 1986, with the conversion of about US$8.6 billion of debt into equity
(see Arcnex 2.7.0), that resulted in a funding mix for investments
(excluding IDC) of 53Z of borrowings, and the remainder was financed with
government and consumer contributions. In 1988, the funding mix was: 46Z
with borrowings, 39Z with Government transfers, 82 with internal funds, and
7Z with customer's contributions.

6.       Assuming that the financial objectives are achieved, CFE would
continue to improve its funding mix and its debt coverage ratio would be
higher than 2.0 during the period 1990-96. CFE would be able to generate
47.22 of its total financial requirements between 1989-1996, making
possible to reduce the need for Government's and consumer equity
contributions to 5.4Z and borrowings to 47.42. Government cash transfers
in the form of equity contributions of US$202 million would be required
only in 1990. In 1989, CFE's short-tezm (about US$530 million) debt was
converted into equity (see Annex 2.7.0). Starting in 1991, it is assumed
that Government contributions would be required only to subsidize energy
consumed by low-income residential and agricultural customers (about 2Z of
the total revenues).
Balance Sheets
7.       The past poor financial performance resulted in a low degree of
liquidity (current ratio lower than 1.0), and a high, albeit fluctuating,
degree of indebtedness (debt/equity ratio of 78132 in 1976 and 60/40 in
1985) which was substantially changed in 1986 (10/90) thanks to the first
set of measures included in the FRA.
8.       The projected balance sheets for the 1990-1996 period show that
the debt/equity ratio will increase but it will remain strong and end up in
1996 as 26/74. Liquidity is expected to be adequate as the current ratio
would be higher than 1.0 every year. The collection period would have a
decreasing trend from 75 days of billing in 1989 to 60 days in 1992, which
is reasonable.

Financial Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA)
Introduction
1.       In August 1986, the Government and CFE signed a Financial
Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA) with the main purpose of reversing the
deteriorating trend in sector finances.  As this agreement expired in
December 31, 1988, a new one was signed on August 31, 1989. as agreed with
the Bank under Loan 3083-ME. It covers the 1989-1994 period. The
following is a summary of the new FRA.
Background
2.       The National Development Plan, approved by the Government in
August 1984 and updated in June 1989, requires that public enterprises
modernize and restructure so as to increase their productivity, reduce
their dependency on foreign resources and make the best use of their
installed capacity. The Plan requires the financial rehabilitation of the
state enterprises through reduction of expenses and increasing their
internal funding. For the latter purpose, the Plan foresees rate
adjustments, reduction of existing subsidies, restructuring of local and
foreign debt and Government equity contributions.
3.       The original FRA established the following financial targets: (i)
to reach a price/cost ratio equal to 1002 in 1988; and (ii) to maintain a
funding mix for investments of: 402 with internal sources, 102 V'th
Government transfers, and 502 with borrowings. The pricelcost ratio target
was not achieved (662 in 1987 and 762 in 1988), because the electricity
rate increases were offset by rising inflation, causing an inadequate
internal fund generation. CFE had to rely heavily oa Government equity
contributions (862 in 1987 and 402 in 1988) to implement its expansion
program, in order to increase installed capacity as required by the power
market. Although the target of new borrowings was about the expected (482
in 1987 and 452 in 1988), CFE had to rely also heavily on short-term debts,
which reached 53Z of the total debt at the end of 1988.
4.       The original FRA also established the following productivity and
efficiency targets:
1967       1986
I)    Annual increase In the working force
not higher than:                 2.S5        2.5X
il)    Customer/employee ratio            15         I6g
iII)    OWh *old/employee:               1,116      1,170
iv)    efficiency of thermal plants     31.6S       81.9
v)    availability of thermal plants     783         763
11    Total customers divided by number of employees working in operation
and maintenance (excludts administration).

Page 2 of 3
Although the increase in the number of employee in the power
sector was lower than exp  ted, the protactivity targets were not reached.
The efficiency and availability of thermal plants targets were surpassed,
reaching 33.32 and 77.22, respectively, in 1988.
The August 1989 FRA
5.       Realizing that the measures taken under the original FRA were not
sufficient to solve the financial weaknesses of CFE, the following measures
were established in the new FRA:
a)   Government to convert about MEX$1.37 billion (about US$530
million) of CFE's debt into Government equity at CFE;
b)   CFE to review current methodology used to calculate the amounts of
savings in interest payments resulting from the conversion of
CFE's debt into Government equity in 1986, by December 31, 1989;
c)   CFE to update the tariff study in order to establish a program of
rate increases in real terms in accordance with macroeconomic
conditions;
d)   in 1991, the electricity rate to be 18.82 greater than the average
rate existing in the first semester of 1989, in real terms;
e)   by 1991, the funding mix of CFE to be as follows: 402 internal
generation, 102 Government contributions, and 502 borrowings;
f)   CFE to limit short-term borrowing (less than one year) from
internal and external markets to no more than 10 percent of its
annual cash operating expenses;
g)   CFE to improve its operational productivity according to the
following performance targetss
1989   199l   1991   1992   1998   1994
T) Customrl/employ I J      189    198    196    1W9    20A    206

h)   CFE to implement an institution building program aimed at:
i) defining criteria in order to implement an adequate system
to rationalize administrative expenses, the management
procedures of the inventories, the level of the working
capital.
ii) defining a system to measure the global productivity of
CFE, establishing a especific ratio for the operating,
administrative and construction areas. The new ratio will
replace the targets indicated in paragraph 5. g).
iii)   defining the actions to be taken in the on-going process of
regionalization and decentralization started by the
company;
iv) continuing the implementation of hourly tariffs, and
establishing targets to reduce peak demand;
i)   CFE to furnish the Government with periodic reports to monitor the
implementation of the new FRA.
Conclusions
6.       The revised PRA is an instrument that, if adequately implemented,
can help transform CFE into a more efficient and financially sound utility.
The financial projections presented in Annex 2.6.0 are based on the
financial targets stated in the new FRA, which should be closely supervised
by the Bank.

CFE's Special diah Voltage Transmission Line Program
Background
1.       CFE has an extensive transmission system that covers most of the
country's territory; at present there are approximately 24,000 km of high
voltage lines (138 to 400 kV) and substations with a capacity of 66,000
MVA. The design, construction, operation and maintenance of the
transmission system is done through seven transmission regions, with
coordination from the central offices; operation of the main lines and
substations is commanded from the National Center for Energy Control -
CENACE.  CFE's transmission regions are the following:
Region                             Status
Oriental                           Connected to the SNI (Sistema
Nacional Interconectado)

Noroeste                           Connected to the SNI
Norte                              Connected to the SNI
Noreste                            Connected to the SNI
Peninsular                         Isolated from the SNI
Baja California                    Isolated from the SNI
Present Situation
2.       The financial restrictions of the past six years constrained the
normal expansion of CFE's transmission system, and today the system has
barely reserves to assure an adequate system reliability. The following
table summarized the past and present situation of CFE's transmission
system:

Transmission Planning
3.       CFE has several mathematical models based on linear programming
and simulation techniques for the optimization of the transmission systems
associated with generation expansion schemes; such models include, among
others the WASP, the EXPANDIN and the MNI programs.  The planning of
transmission systems is done aiming towards a long-term horizon, usually 10
to 20 years in the future, for which a transmission scheme at national
level is designed. After this step, planning is narrowed to regional and
local levels for a medium (5 to 10 years) and short-term periods. The
purpose of this planning process is to minimize investments and operation
and maintenance costs, taking into account the cost of capital and
technical aspects such as load flow, short circuit levels, system
stability, voltage and frequency regulation, energy loss minimization, etc.
System reliability for each alternative scheme is compared considering the
cost of energy not served due to unplanned interruptions.
CFE's Special Transmission Program
4.       The report "Programa de Construcci6n de Obras en el Area de
Transmisi6n de CFE - Julio 10, 1989" describes the proposed emergency
program, to be developed in the period 1990-93 in the entire country. In
addition to this program, CFE and CLFC will carry out the routine expansion
of their systems.
5.       The estimated cost of the proposed specia' program is US$945
million (current costs) and it includes the cost of equipment and
materials, labor, engineering, supervision and physical contingencies (102)
(see Annex 3.1.1.); the program will include the following components:
a) Installation of new tr.niformers with a capacity of 10,400 MVA in
existing or new substations, and 1,020 circuit breakers; and
b)   Construction of a total of 700 high voltage feeders and
transmission lines with a total length of 7,500 km.
6.       The equipment and materials is to be purchased through
approximately 19 contracts, and will be delivered at the warehouses of the
transmission regional offices, which would be in charge of the final design
and construction of the projects, mainly utilizing outside contractors to
be financed by CFE.

TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
CFE's Special Distribution Program
Background
1.       CFE is in charge of the distribution of electric power in the
entire country, except for the metro,olitan area of Mexico City which is
covered by the Compaflia de Luz y Fuerza del Centro - CLPC. The general
coordination of planning for the distribution networks, including budgetary
allocations and control is done at CFE's headquarters in Mexico City; the
detailed planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance is the
responsibility of the following Distribution Regions:
Region                                      Headquarters
Baja California                   Mexicali, B.C.

Peninsular                        Merida, Yuc.
Present Situation of the Distribution Network
2.       Due to CFE's budgetary constraints of the past, investments in
distribution were restricted to low levels; as a consequence, most of the
distribution networks in the country, including CLFC's area, are
overloaded, without reserves, and all require an urgent overhaul. As of
December 1988, a total of 1,044,000 customers (or 72 of total customers)
were connected directly, without a meter. Energy losses, although
relatively low if compared with other Latin American countries, have
increased sligh:ly in the recent past, and would worsen if no immediate
action is taken.

Distribution Planning
4.       CFE's distribution system includes the distribution substations
(at present about 1,000 with a capacity of 19,200 MVA) that reduce the sub-
transmission voltage (138, 115 and 69 KV) to distribution levels (34.5, 23
and 13.8 KV). The overall planning for sub-transmission lines,
distribution substation and primary feeders starts with considerations of
regional maximum demands and special loads; with the help of computerized
models and using CFE's standardized voltages and designs, several
alternatives to supply demand growth are considered, and the least cost
solutions are selected.
5.       At present the planning and design of the secondary networks is
executed by manual methods with the help of computerized models. In order
to improve the planning methods and optimize resources, CFE, with the
assistance of the Instituto de Investigaciones Electricas (IIE) of Mexico,
has developed computerized models for distribution network design and
management (the SIPLADIS Model, or "Sistema para la Planeaci6n de Redes de
Distribucifn"); the model includes siz modules for the design and analysis
of the sub-transmission system (SUBTRA Module), secondary networks
(REDESC), transformer management (GESTRA), distribution losses (ANAPER),
system reliability (CONFIA) and investments (PROINV). The models have been
tested in the networks serving the cities of Morelia and Reynosa, with
positive results. Under the present operation, IDB will provide financial
assistance to accelerate the implementation of the new methods.
The Proposed CFE's Special Program
6.       In order to overhaul rapidly the poor situation of its
distribution networks, CFE has decided to start, with the assistance of the
proposed Bank operation, a five-year special program described in the
report *Programa Especial para Ampliaciones y Mejoras en el Area de
Distribuci6n, Junio 19899. In addition, CFE and CLFC will continute with
their regular programs to take care of the routine expansion of the system.

improvement from 912 to 95Z. Cost US$25.0 million; benefits
Us$140.0 million.
d)   Manual and automatic reclosing equipment (45,000 total) to improve
average service interruption tinue from 676 minutes per customer
per year (1988 average) to 360. Cost US$102.0 million; benefits
US$310.0 million.
e)   Improvement in 31,000 secondary networks, including installation
of 1,250 MVA in distribution transformers and construction of
18,800 km of secondary feeders. Cost US$230.0 million; benefits
US$310.0 million.
f)   Purchase of 830 fully equipped vehicles for distribution network
maintenance. Cost US$70.0 million.
g)   Purchase and installation of 5,550,000 electric meters to cover
about one million customers connected at present to the grid
without a meter and about 700,000 new connections per year. Cost
US$123.0 million; benefits US$238.0 million.
h)   Installation of 665 computer billing stations.  Cost US$22.0
million; benefits US$30.5.
8.       The equipment will be purchased through approximately 29 contracts
to be placed by CFE's central offices; deliveries will be made directly
from the manufacturer to the distribution regional warehouses. Each region
will be responsible for the execution of the project, utilizing their own
construction force and local contractors. All CFE's regional offices have
the experience and capability to carry out the project without delays.

Thermo-Electric Power Plant Special Renovation Proaram
Operation and Maintenance of CFE's Thermal Power Plants
1.       CFE has high standards for the operation and maintenance of their
thermoelectric power plants across the country. Graduate electrical and
mechanical engineers are in charge of the supervision of all important
tasks. The selected engineers are placed in a training program which
includes six months of classroom instruction in the fundamentals of plant
operation, followed by three months of field training in a power plant.
The last month of training is done in one of the CFE training centers, some
have computerized simulators. The unit operators are prepared for their
assignments through training in the newer plants which have a five shift
operating organization, that permits one shift to be in training at all
times. The plant instruction books are written in Spanish and are
available for reference by all plant personnel.
2.       The maintenance department is also well trained and prepared for
their work. Engineers are employed as group supervisors to maintain the
plant systems. There are several groups each of which specializes in the
repair of specific equipment, for examples boiler, turbine, electrical
equipment, auxiliary mechanical equipment, etc. The planning and ex'ecution
of plant maintenance and repairs are well organized and managed. Schedules
are made and monitored clLsely, safety tagging procedures are enforced and
parts inventories and warehouse storing and protection systems are all in
place and functioning. This includes a maximum/minimum inventory control
system.
Plant Renovation Program
3.       In the last few years, the performance of CFE's thermoelectric
power plants has been less than optimal, as the availability factor reached
values as low as 65Z in 1981. The degradation of the CFE thermal plants
was caused by two major problems: a) financial constraints placed on CFE
impacted on their ability to expeditiously purchase spare parts for their
repair and b) the use of high sulfur, high vanadium Mexican fuel oil had a
severe impact on the life and performance of plant equipment and systems,
as well as on the environment in the form of high sulfur and nitrogen oxide
emissions.
4.       Steps have been taken by CFE to improve above situation, and
through an intensive maintenance program the availability factor of the
thermal power plants was increased to 76S in 1988. In addition, CFE is
planning to embark in a large upgrading and renovation program, that would
take several years; the first stage of this program would be developed in
the period 1990-94, with the financial assistance of the Bank through the
present operation, and would restore 38 generating units to full capacity,
and would improve their efficiency and availability. The proposed program
would include the following power plants and units:

5.       The scope of the upgrading work includes repairs to the boiler
internal heat transfer systems (superheater, reheater and economizer), and
the boiler auxiliaries which have been damaged by the high sulfur and
vanadium chemicals in the fuel oil. The program also encompasses repairing
turbine generator equipment and systems, and renovating heat exchanger
surfaces in the feedwater and cooling water systems, repairing boiler
pressure casing leaks, soot blower repairs and replacements, instruments
and controls overhaul, condenser retubing work, major pump renovation,
insulation replacement, electrical equipment and cable replacement and
repairs, fueld handling system repairs and other vital repairs to operating
machines and systems. These and other critical improvements all impact on
the optimum operation of tne units covered by the program as they deal with
availability, efficiency and capacity.
6.       CFE prepared the report entitled: 'Programa Especial de
Modernizacion de las Centrales Termoelectricas' of June, 1989, which
contains details of the proposed program. The overall cost is US$289
million (current prices), as shown in detail in Annex 3.3.1.

Proiect Implementation
4.       CFE will be in charge of all phases of execution of the Ten-year
Investment Program and of the proposed Project (the 1991-92 time slice).
In particular, the special transmission, distribution and thermal plant
renovation programs, to be funded by the proposed Bank loan, will be
coordinated by the TrrAnsmission Project Management and the Distribution
Management Units of the Direction of Construction and by the Thermoelectric
Projects Management Unit of the Direction of Operation; these units will
provide engineering, administration and general supervision services, while
the local regional offices concerned will execute the projects of their
regions, most of them through CFE's construction crews, although local
contractors are expected to be hired. Procurement will be coordinated by
the Supplies Management Unit, and deliveries will be made directly to the
regional warehouses. The overall courdination of the Bank-financed project
will be done by a Special Projects Unit created for this purpose at the
General Director's level; this unit will also supervise the execution of
the Thermal Plant Pollution Control Study, and the Study of the
Environmental Aspects of Transmission Lines and Substations, for which
external consultants will be hired to assist a special task force that CFE
will set to carry out the study.
5.       Details of the project implementation schedule for the three
special programs to be funded by the Bank are shown in Annex 3.4.3; it has
been assumed that for the goods to be financed by the Bank, most of the
contracts would be placed in 1990 and 1991 and an advanced 102 payment
would be done; most of the deliveries would take place in 1991 and 1992,
but some contracts are assumed to be delayed to 1993 with final payments
due not later than June 1993. Based on this schedule of deliveries, an
estimated loan disbursement schedule was prepared and is shown in Annex
3.4.4, and the proposed loan allocation by categories is shown in Annex
3.4.5.

Economic Analysis
Backgrouand
1.    The aim of the economic analysis is to judge whether there are enough
benefits to justify the commitment of resources to CFE's Ten-year Investment
Program. The program has previously been determined to be the least cost means
of meeting the forecast increment in demand at the aggregate level, appropriate
for the determination of the generation and transmission programs. Hence, the
costs and benefits are defined, not with respect to the next best alternative,
but in relation to not doing anything at all, the "without program" situation.
The approach is to estimate the incremental cost and benefit streams and compute
the economic indicators of the program, the net present value at the opportunity
cost of capital (OCC) for Mexico, and the economic rate of return (ERR). The
analysis period consists of the construction time and the operating life of the
projects to be commissioned in the program.
Economic Costs
2.   The financial flows were converted to economic costs by: (a) netting out
taxes and other domestic transfers; (b) expressing the import content at cif
prices; and (c) applying shadow prices to the domestic components. The costs
include the required investments for the Ten-year Investment Program.  The
composition of investment and the conversion factors employed in the economic
analyisis are presented in Table 1 below.

3.    Other costs refer to the operation and maintenance of the projects and
those system expenses associated with the incremental electricity supply. Based
on CFE's experience, annual operation and maintenance costs were estimated at
around 2% of capital costs, including administrative and general overheads. The
system costs refer to the fuel expenditures necessary to generate the incremental
power, which would not be incurred if the program was not done. The fuel costs
were valued at US$ 22 per MWh, based on international fuel prices and the
existing and projected system plant mix.
Benefits
4.    Benefits include the consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for the additional
electricity supply, the resource savings and in and the increased reliability
provided.   The first benefit WTP comprises:   the additional sales and the
consumers' surplus. The additional energy was calculated based on percentages
of total incremental demand attributed to the program (see Table 2 and graph 1).
Sales revenue was then estimated multiplying the incremental energy with end user
tariffs. The consumers' surplus was next calculated from estimates of the demand
curves.

Figure 1: Demand Deficit
5.   There are two approaches for the estimation of the WTP: (a) the avoided
costs of the alternative methods of meeting users' demands for lighting, motive
power, etc. displaced by electricity, or (b) the valuation of the area under the
users' demand curve, which requires estimates of the price elasticities of
demand.    When  there  is little market data,  as  in  the case  of rural
electrification schemes, the first method is favored. However, the second method
is better suited for established markets with an adequate data base. Thus, in
this study the second approach has been employed.   Table 3 provides the
electricity tariffs and the price elasticities of demand.
6.   Resource savings occur from the substitution of more expensive generation
and from the reduction in losses. If the investment program is not implemented,
part of the demand (the demand without the project or D,_) will continue to be
supplied, and part will not, because of capacity constrains and reliability

8.    The benefit of increased reliability has been assessed from conservative
estimat . of the reduction in random outages of electricity supply attributable
to the p.rogram. The unserved energy has then been valued with a weighted outage
cost. CFE has estimated, based on econometric studies, the cost of industrial
outages at US$ 1.20/kWh, which although rather conservative, provides a minimum
benefit level. From the cost of industrial outages, the value of outages for
household, commercial, agricultural, and other users' was derived.
Cost Benefit Results
9.   The economic analysis was carried out in two phases.  The first approach
nly considers what consumers actually pay for electricity under the existing
ariff. The benefits in this stage are measured more with financial rather than
*conomic criteria, since only the cost and benefits accruing to the power sector
are considered: sales revenues and cost savings. Thus, the resulting adjusted
internal rate of return (IRR) says more about the adequacy of tariffs end their
relationship to LRMC, than about the true economic worth of the proposed
investments.   In the second stage, benefits are estimated in terms of the
economy, considering consumers' willingness to pay for the incremental power
supply, and the reliability improvements to the users of the service.
10.   The IRR of the program is 12.3%, which is in line with the opportunity cost
of capital (OCC) in Mexico of about 12%, while the economic rate of return (ERR)
amounts to 13.6%. These rates of return are based on the agreement reached with
CFE that tariffs will be increased in real terms to achieve specific financial
targets, including a rate of return on fixed assets equal to 7% by 1996. Table
4 and graph 2 present the discounted cost and benefit streams of the program.
t tn estimating the increase in sales attributed to the investment program, the reliability levels In
the with and without project situations are maintained equivalent. This prevents supplyin a larger sales
increment at the expense of degrading the quality of service.

Sensitivity Analysis
11.   The investment program is subject to several risks and uncertainties, of
which the most relevant has to do with funding and tariff levels.   Other
uncertain factors concern capital expenditures and fuel costs. Table 5 below
shows the change in the economic indicators if: (a) rates stayed constant at 1990
price levels; (b) demand grows at the lower rate of 5% p.a., instead of the 6.6%
contemplated in the basic scenario; (c) capital costs increase to the point where
the ERR decreases to a value equivalent to the OCC, and (d) fuel costs were 30%
higher (and are not passed on to the consumer).
12.   If the amount the user pays is maintained constant at the 1990 tariff level
(about US j 4.2 per kWh), the economics of the overall investment program
deteriorate rapidly. The IRR mnd the ERR drop to 5% and 7%, respectively. If
demand grows less than forecasted, say 5% per annum, the ERR declines to 11%.
However,  this "what if" analysis does not consider the plant scheduling
flexibility of the Mexican generation program (postponing new plant construction
to match market growth), which would have the effect of raising the ERR.
Finally, the program has a capital cost margin of 11%, or a fuel cost margin of
31% before inmastment cost cverruns, or fuel cost increases, would turn the
program uneconomic.

13.   In summary, the analysis shows that the investment program is economic as
long as the agreed tariff adjustments are carried out.   Any delay in the
implementation of the rate increases, will result in the IRR to fall below the
opportunity cost of capital, and if the delay is serious, the ERR would also drop
below the OCC. Any advance in the rate adjustment schedule would have the effect
of boosting the economic indicators of the program.
