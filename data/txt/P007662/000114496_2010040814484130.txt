                    Description of the Project
      The objectives of the Project are to: (a) support CFE's
transmission and distribution program for the years 1991-1992 with
the purpose of meeting industrial and commercial demand and
expanding residential coverage, while improving the technical

capabilities to address environmental issues related to the
operation of thermoelectric power plants and to the construction of
transmission lines and (e) continue improving CFE's management,
technical, financial and energy conservation functions.
      The Project consists of the following parts, subject to such
modifications thereof as the Borrower and the Bank may agree upon
from time to time to achieve such objectives:
Part A:     CFE's Investment Program 1991-1992

placing into operation of, new power plants with a total capacity of
approximately 1,200 megawatts and start of the construction of new
power plants in accordance with the Ten-Year Investment Plan.
2.    Transmission Program: Construction of high voltage
transmission lines, substations and related facilities, and without
limitation to the foregoing, the execution of the Special
Transmission Program in respect of the years 1991-1992.
3.    Distribution Program: Connection of approximately 1.1 million

5.    General Plant: Investments in facilities required for the
operation of CFE including, without limitation, office buildings,
vehicles and office equipment.
Part B:     Studies and Technical Assistance

1.    (a)   A study on the environmental aspects of transmission
lines and substations, such study to examine: (i) issues related to
rights of way; (ii) resettlements; (iii) health effects of
transmission lines and substations; (iv) the effects of the use of
fire and biocides to maintain rights of way; (v) organizational
aspects of CFE in the areas of environmental matters with regard to
transmission lines and substations; and (vi) the design of the
training program referred to in subparagraph (b) below.
      (b)   A training program for the personnel of CFE and SEDUE on
the environmental aspects of transmission lines and substations.
2.    (a)   A study for the purposes of: (i) determining the nature
and extent of the prevailing level of pollution caused by thermal
power plants to air, land and water; and (ii) performing technical
and economical analyses of alternative means to reduce pollution and
affluents from thermal plants to permissible levels.
      (b)   A training program for the personnel of CFE and SEDUE on
the control and reduction of pollution caused by thermal power
plants.
