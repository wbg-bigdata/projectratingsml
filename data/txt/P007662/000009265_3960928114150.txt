MENORANDUM AND RUCO"ENDATION OP TUE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERRATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELORIENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DXRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO KACIONAL VINANCIERA, S.N.C. (RAPIN)
WITH TEE GUARATEE OF TEE GOVERNMENT OF )MICO
FOR A TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN), for the equivalent of US$450.0 million is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be guaranteed by the
Government of Mexico and would have a term of 17 years, including five years
of grace, with interest at the standard variable rate. The Loan proceeds
would be relent by NAFIN to Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE), at the
same terms and conditions as the Bank loan except that (i) the sub-loan would
be denominated in US dollars and (ii) NAFIN would charge a fee amounting to
10X of the interest charged by the Ba-k and an intermediary fee. The US
dollar to Mexican peso exchange and interest rate risks would be borne by CFE,
and NAFIN would bear the US dollar to basket of currencies exchange risk.
2.       Background.  CFE is responsible for the supply of electric service in
all of Mexico. Until the early 70's, CFE's finances were sound and the Bank
made 11 loans to help fund the development of Mexico's power system. Since
the mid-70's a deteriorating trend qtarted as electricity prices decreased,
reaching at times levels that did not even cover operating costs; to
compensate for this situation, the power sector had to depend heavilj on
Government transfers and fuel subsidies, which together peaked to 2.32 of GDP
in 1983. In addition, CFE's dependence on foreign loans increased, reaching
an accumulated debt of almost US$10 billion in 1986. As this situation was
unsustainable, in 1986 a Financial Rehabilitation Agreement (FRA) was signed
between CFE and the Government in which goals were set to improve CFE's
finances through electricity rate increases and organizational and technical
efficiency improvements. This agreement addressed several of the Bank's
concerns on the power sector, and - after a 17-year lending hiatus - enabled
granting of a loan in 1989 to finance a Hydroelectric Development Project.
The conditionality in this loa-i provides for least cost investment planning
and Bank annual reviews of CFE's investment program, and sets financial
targets for CFE which will enable continuing the reduction of Government
subsidies through further increases in the overall level of electricity rates
and efficiency improvements; CFE's expected financial rate of return on
revalued assets in operation is expected to improve from about 2? in 1989 to
3X in 1990 and to 4X in 1991. The Hydroelectric Development Project also
includes substantial conditionality on environmental and resettlement
practices for hydroelectric power projects.
3.       Other sectoral issues still need to be addressed: tariff schedules
have to be revised to reduce cross subsidies among consumers over time,
transmission and distribution planning need to be improved, energy losses
reduced and distribution metering expanded. Today there is a heavy backlog of
unmet needs, particularly in distribution and in thermal power plant
upgrading, due to the need in the past years to limit investments and reduce
public sector expenditures because of macroeconomic reasons. CFE's Ten-year
Investment Program includes special investment programs that would address
these problems, the goals of which are to construct 7,500 km of high voltage
lines, 12,500 of power transformers, 19,000 km of secondary feeders, 1,250 MVA



of distribution transformers and increase capacity by 1,100 MW by upgrading
existing thermal plants.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's country strategy is to
support the Government's objectives of stabilization and structural change to
the economy. The proposed project is in harmony with ongoing Bank's
acjustment loans and with the Hydroelectric Development Project which seek to
improve sectoral efficiency, introduce pricing policies based on economic
criteria, reduce the reliance of public enterprises on Government funding and
open procurement of goods and services to international markets. The
continuation of the Bank's involvement in the power sector (which now accounts
for about 15? of total public sector investment) would enable the Bank to
expand the dialogue on pricing policy in the sector, review in detail the
planning criteria for transmission and distribution and the sectoral
investment programs and financial plans, and expand the focus of environmental
issues. In addition, the proposed Bank loan and the mobilization of other
resources, including the Inter-American Development Bank and the EXIMBANK of
Japan, would allow CFE to undertake priority investments, without resorting to
significant Government's budgetary transfers.
5.       Project Obiectives:  (a) Promote improvements and upgrading of
thermoelectric power plants to reduce the investment requirements of the
sector; (b) correct distortions in the tariff structure, reducing cross
subsidies among consumers to improve end-user efficiency (c) strengthen CFE's
internal capabilities to address environmental issues related to the operation
of thermoelectric power plants and to the construction of transmission lines;
(d) further pursue the improvement goals agreed under the Hydroelectric
Development Project on management, technical, financial and energy
conservation aspects; and (e) fund CFE's transmission and distribution program
for 1991-92 with the purpose of meeting industrial and commercial demand and
slightly expanding residential coverage, while improving the technical
efficiency and reliability of electric service.
6.       Project Description:  The project consists of a two-year time slice
(1991-92) of CFE's Ten-year Investment Program. The proposed Bank loan would
help fund four basic components: (a) a transmission and substation program
aimed at expanding and improving installations rated 400 kV to 115 kV (40? of
the Bank's proposed loan); (b) a distribution program that would expand and
improve CFE's distribution grid, including meters for customers presently
connected directly without metering (34.5?); (c) a program to upgrade
thermoelectric power plants to improve thermal efficiency and availability of
CFE's main plants (25?); and (d) environmental and pollution control studies
related to these components (0.5X). The two-year time slice is part of CFE's
least-cost program; the engineering design for the programs to be financed by
the Bank is at an advanced stage. The total cost of the project, including
firancial charges (US$416 million) is estimated at US$7,127 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$3,100 million (43?). The
executing agency, CFE, has the technical and administrative capacity to carry
out the project. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursements, as well
as disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B, a timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Mexico are given
in Schedule C and D, respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal Report, No.
8191-ME dated March 20, 1990, are also attached.



7.       Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, agreements were reached on: (a)
an action plan to modify by January 1, 1992 the electricity tariff structure
to minimize cross subsides among consumers and promote consumer efficiency;
(b) the increase of the price of residual oil ('combustoleo") used by CFE for
thermoelectric generation, to reach international levels by June 30, 1992; (c)
the execution, by September 30, 1991, of environmental studies and .raining
programs related with transvission lines and thermoelectric power plants and
the agreement by December 31, 1991 with the IBank on an action plan to
implement the recommendation of the study; (d) CFE's proposed annual operating
and investment budgets and financing plan for the upcoming year to be
presented for Bank's comments, by October 31 of each year; and (e) financial
rates of return on CFE's revalued net fixed assets in operation would
progressively increase so as to achieve the following minimum targets: 42 in
1992, 52 in 1993; 62 in 1994, 6.52 in 1995 and 72 in 1996 and thereafter, to
enable a contribution to investment from internally generated funds of not
less than 402. In addition, during 1990 and 1991 tariffs would be increased
in real terms by not less than 92 each year, as already agreed previously
under the Hydroelectric Development Project.
8.       Conditions of loan effectiveness are the signature of a subsidiary
loan agreement between NAPIN and CFE and satisfactory progress in the
implementation of commitments under Loan 3083-ME including the FRA and the
execution of studies.
9.       Proiect Benefits.  The project would enable CFE to keep electric
energy losses at low levels, improve the reliability of service and continue
with the program of improvements in organizational, financial and technical
issues initiated under the Hydroelectric Development Project; the project
would also aid the Government in its program to improve the performance of
public enterprises, reduce Government subsidies and achieve efficient
allocation of resources. The economic rate of return on CFE's Ten-year
Investment Program is about 14Z; if consumer surplus is not considered it
would be 12X.
10.      Risks.  The main risk would arise from CFE's failure to continue
increasing electricity rates, which would affect sector finances and result in
a shortage of local counterpart funds and in project execution delays.
However, the Government appears to be firm in its price policy reforms and has
shown strong evidence of its commitment as reflected by the 5.5Z increase in
real terms in 1989; in this context, the recent extension to the economic pact
signals the end to a long period of price freeze, shifting instead to a more
predictable and continuous process of regular public sector price adjustments.
Another concern is the lack of access to external financing in the amounts
required, to meet which the Bank would play an active role in putting together
a cofinancing package. The project does not pose special technical or
environmental problems.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan eomplies with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
