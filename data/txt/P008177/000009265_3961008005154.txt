MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION
OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
ADMMISTRACION NACIONAL DE
USINAS Y TRASMISIONES ELECTRICAS
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF URUGUAY FOR
A POWER TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to Administraci6n Nacional de Usinas y
Trasmisiones El6ctricas (UTE), with the guarantee of the Republic of
Uruguay, for the amount of US$125 million to help finance a power
transmission and distribution project. The proposed loan would be on LIBOR-
based US dollar single currency loan terms repayable in 15 years, including
five years of grace.
2.    Background. Uruguay's energy resources are limited. No oil or gas
reserves are known and only very small coal (with a high ash content and low
caloric value) reserves exist. Thus, the country has to rely on oil imports to
cover a significant share (55 %) of its energy requirements. Hydropower
resources are basically already exhausted (88 % of all possible hydropotential is
utilized) and the remaining potential hydro capacity (12%) is not economically
viable to develop given the present level of fuel prices. As a consequence,
immediate power demand will need to be met by energy conservation, thermal
installations, and eventual power net imports from neighboring countries.
Uruguay has maintained adequate pricing for oil derivatives and power plus
additional conservation measures, which has reduced the share of oil in its
energy consumption over the last 20 years (declining from 75 % of total energy
consumption in the 1970s to 55% in recent years). Electricity tariffs are
correctly structured based on marginal costs, and there are no subsidies.
However, additional load characteristics studies will be needed to guide tariff
study updates and UTE's actions with regard to demand-side management.
Uruguay's neighbors (Argentina and Brazil) have great potential for natural
gas and hydropower, respectively. The importation of natural gas and
electricity from these countries is consequently a potential source of energy for
Uruguay. In view of its constraints in energy supply for medium and long-
range development, Uruguay needs to develop a clear energy strategy for the
coming years. Initial studies on the subject are being carried out as part of the
proposed project.



-2 -
3.    The power distribution system of Montevideo is antiquated (some parts
are over 60 years old) and requires modernization to reduce service
interruptions and technical losses that constrain Uruguayan industrial and
service operations. The actual network topology is totally inadequate, with no
circuit breakers in the 30-kV system. This means that several substations
become inoperative when a fault occurs in one of them. The distribution
voltage to the consumers is phase-to-phase, which is potentially very
dangerous since there are no ground connections. This also contributes to high
technical losses. A Bank-financed and independently confirmed study (under
the Power Engineering Loan 2484-UR) recommended the complete renovation
of the distribution system, to change voltage levels (from 220 V (phase-to-
phase) to 380/220 V and from 6 kV and 30 kV to a single voltage of 22 kV).
UTE is planning to implement the required renovation in four phases of five
years each. The immediate need is to begin work on the first phase, which
would concentrate on the oldest part of the system, and in areas where system
extensions are critically needed.
4.    The power sector institutional framework is being modified. During
preparation of the proposed project, the Bank helped the Government to
develop a new legal and regulatory system based on consultant services funded
under the Public Enterprise Reform Loan (Loan 3517-0-UR). As a condition
of negotiations of this proposed project, the Government enacted a Presidential
Decree removing from UTE all regulatory power it had. This Decree created
the Energy Technical Commission (Comisi6n Tecnica de Energfa - CTE),
composed of representatives of the Ministers of Energy, Economy and the
Director of the Planning and Budget Office, to give technical support to the
Government on regulatory issues and on tariff setting. A new regulatory
system would be enacted as a condition of effectiveness of the Loan. The new
system removes from UTE all responsibility for policy formulation, power
planning, and regulatory functions, and clearly defines a concession regime for
private investments in competitive power generation. In advance of those
changes, UTE is opening power generation to private sector participation. It
has contracted independent power producers (timber companies) to provide
power to the interior, and has already decided to seek private investments for
additional installations of independent power producers to meet future
generation requirements in Montevideo. Simultaneously (under the Power
Modernization Project - Loan 3221-UR), UTE has undergone strong
modernization, considerably improving its commercial orientation and
corporate structure in line with project objectives. However, additional
improvements, especially in staffing and managerial capacity, are still needed.
5.    Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project is fully
consistent with the Bank's country assistance strategy for Uruguay, discussed



- 3 -
at the Board on January 25, 1994, together with Natural Resources
Management and Irrigation Development Project (Loan 3697-UR). The
project will help enhance Uruguayan productivity to improve its economic
competitiveness. The strategy envisaged combines: (a) maintaining the Bank
dialogue with the Government to help implement the new regulatory
framework in accordance with recommended Bank policy for the power sector;
and (b) helping the Government to improve power supply reliability, which is
the major infrastructure-related complaint of local businesses for private sector
development. Uruguay's power sector is engaged in a critical period of
reforms (initiated under the Public Enterprise Reform Loan), including the
establishment of a new regulatory system, modernization of its institutions, and
promotion of private participation. The proposed project would enable the
Bank to be instrumental in furthering the needed reforms in the power sector
and in providing the necessary assistance to implement them, profiting from
the Bank worldwide experience in sector reforms. In addition, it would
address the increasing obsolescence of Uruguay's capital stock and help
overcome one of the greatest infrastructure concerns raised by the productive
sector: power supply unreliability.
6.    Project Objectives. The proposed project aims to improve reliability
of the electricity service at least cost and to help sustain the recent reforms in
the power sector by helping UTE to adapt to the changing sector institutional
framework. Project objectives include: (i) consolidating sector reforms; (ii)
consolidating UTE's institutional improvements; (iii) improving power
distribution reliability; (iv) promoting efficient use of energy; and (v)
enhancing customer safety.
7.    Project Description. The proposed project would support the first of
four phases of the modernization of the distribution system of Montevideo.
This would cover the most critical areas of the city. The project would also
include strengthening, adaptation, and expansion of the transmission system to
allow the renovation of the distribution system as well as the power supply to
meet market growth and the preparation and implementation of a demand-side
management program. The proposed project would therefore include: (a)
modification of 500-kV substations (23 % of base cost) -- consisting of the
expansion of substations I in Montevideo and San Carlos in Punta del Este
through the installation of two power transformers, reactive power control
devices and the related switchgear equipment in each of these substations, and
installation of new 500-kV line bays in substations A and B; (b) expansion of
the 150-kV Transmission System in Montevideo (27% of base cost) --
consisting of the replacement of the switchgear equipment and reinforcement
of grounding system of the 150-kV substations to meet the new short-circuit
requirements of the system; the installation of about 26 km of 150-kV



underground cables interconnecting substations; and the expansion of
substations E and J and the installation of the new substation G; (c) the first
phase of the renovation of the Montevideo distribution system (48 % of base
cost) -- consisting of installation of a new system in the areas of influence of
substations G, L and R; (d) technical assistance (1 % of base cost) -- to help
UTE restructure into business units as part of the sector reforms, to support
project implementation, to assist UTE in developing load characteristics
analyses for marginal cost studies and for load management actions, to help
UTE update its marginal cost studies, to implement a Non-Technical Losses
Reduction Program, and to prepare and implement a Demand-side
Management Program; and (e) training (1 % of base cost) -- including
seminars to train UTE's managers for the new power sector structure,
seminars to train UTE's staff in the new sector structure and UTE's changing
role, and strengthening UTE's environmental unit.
8.    Project Cost and Financing. The total financing requirements
(including interest during construction of US$31.5 million equivalent) are
estimated at US$228 million equivalent, of which US$156.5 million equivalent
would be foreign. The Bank would finance the foreign component of goods
for the project, the technical assistance and the training program (US$125.0
million). UTE would finance the local costs and interest during construction
(US$103.0 million). So that UTE can continue its ongoing study of load
characteristics and to initiate the most urgent procurement of goods, US$3.0
million would be provided for retroactive financing of expenditures made up to
12 months prior to loan signing. A special account would be established in the
amount of US$2.0 million. A breakdown of project costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Uruguay are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively. A
map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 13433-UR, is being
distributed separately.
9.    A LEBOR-based single currency loan is proposed at the request of UTE
with the approval of the Government of Uruguay. The loan would be
repayable over 15 years, including 5 years of grace period. UTE is eligible
for a single currency loan, since UTE and the Government of Uruguay have
authorized the conversion of all VRL82 loans. The proposed US$125 million
loan exceeds the US$100 million guideline for SCLs to Uruguay. However,
although the proposed amount exceeds the lending volume guideline, it is
preferable on project technical grounds not to split the loan between single
currency and currency pool tranches, and the amount over the guideline is not



- 5 -
excessive. Uruguay does not intend to seek another loan from the Bank under
the single currency loan terms in this fiscal year.
10.  Implementation. The project would be coordinated by a Project
Coordinator and a full time project unit within UTE (the same existing
implementation unit for the on-going projects). Project Directors for each
component (Transmission, Distribution, and Training), with qualifications
satisfactory to the Bank, would not be replaced without consultation with the
Bank. The project coordinator and project directors would work within UTE's
organizational structure with the assistance of the project unit. Procurement,
construction, engineering, and financial services would be performed by
UTE's organization structure units. UTE would maintain the project unit in
place during project implementation, and the Project Coordinator and the
Project Directors would not be replaced without consultation with the Bank.
The Minister of Energy would appoint a coordinator for dialogue with the
Bank on sector institutional reforms. UTE would implement the project in
accordance with an agreed Project Implementation Plan.
11.   Sustainability. Current tariff levels would allow UTE to generate cash
internally sufficient to fund its participation in the project. UTE financial
situation is satisfactory and would improve, at current tariff levels, due to
market growth (Schedule E). Thus UTE is also expected to improve its cash
generating margin and generate sufficient cash, after paying debt service and
income taxes to execute the investment program for the period (1995-2003).
Schedule F presents a sensitivity analysis which shows that even in the worst
case scenario UTE would continue to have satisfactory internal cash
generation, cash operating ratio, debt service ratio, and self-financing ratio.
The expansion of the transmission network will help bring additional revenues
to UTE and an adequate supply for its customers. The renovation of the
distribution system will continue to produce benefits to UTE and to its
customers by reducing power outages and losses. The new sector institutional
framework being developed is expected to facilitate sustainable growth for the
power sector, while opening the possibility for private participation in power
generation.
12.   Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. UTE's performance under
previous projects was somewhat slow, notably because of lengthy procurement
procedures in Uruguay and a weak project unit that delayed project
implementation. However, it has improved considerably, profiting from
lessons learned. During the preparation of the most recent project (Power
Modernization Project, Loan 3221-UR), procurement of the major project
component moved forward, which resulted in a very successful advance in
project implementation. Also profiting from lessons learned, the Bank urged



-6-
UTE to strengthen the project unit. These lessons were applied in the
preparation of this project by advancing procurement document preparation
and by establishing up a strong project implementation unit. UTE is currently
implementing two Bank-funded projects. Loan 2622-UR (Power Plant
Rehabilitation Project) is financing the rehabilitation of the Gabriel Terra
Hydroplant, and an associated B-Loan is financing transmission and
distribution expansion. The project was initially delayed due to problems in
mobilizing all required external financing (negotiation of the B-Loan and
French cofinancing). The project is now being implemented adequately with
all equipment procured; construction works are underway and are expected to
be concluded in December 1996 for transmission and in December 1997 for
generation facilities. Loan 3221-UR (Power Modernization Project) is
financing the installation of a thermal plant, an Institutional Development
Program (IDP), and localized improvements in the distribution network. The
thermal plant was installed one year ahead of schedule and is functioning
normally. The IDP is well advanced and has resulted in fundamental and
important modifications in UTE, improving all areas of management, but
particularly in commercialization and corporatization aspects. The company
has a much better corporate structure and is much more client oriented. The
distribution network has already reduced the average duration of interruption
of service to less than four hours, compared to 16 hours previously. In
addition to these loans to UTE, the Bank is financing the Public Enterprise
Reform Loan (3517-0-UR), which is funding technical assistance for designing
the institutional reforms under implementation in the Power Sector.
13.  Issues and Actions. Most issues regarding sector reforms have been
addressed during project preparation and the ongoing Bank-Government
dialogue. As a condition of negotiations, the Government enacted a Decree
removing from UTE the regulatory power it had and creating the CTE. The
Government has also launched an Energy Options study to guide future
decisions on electricity generation as a second condition of negotiations.
During negotiations, agreements were obtained on a Technical Assistance
component to help implement the new institutional and regulatory framework
in a manner consistent with the Bank's policies for the power sector. Also
during negotiations, UTE and the Government confirmed the agreements
reached during appraisal on other outstanding issues, which include: (a) the
implementation of an adequate plan of action to improve UTE's efficiency,
particularly concerning the creation of "business units" with their own cost-
accounting system, improvement of staffing efficiency including contracting to
the private sector certain activities currently being developed by UTE's own
personnel; (b) the implementation of a plan of action to reduce non-technical
losses; (c) the implementation of a satisfactory Demand-side Management
Program; (d) confirmation of the agreed project implementation scheme,



- 7 -
including activities of the project implementation unit and preparation of
procurement documents; and (e) implementation of a training program, which
would include training for the Environmental Unit. As a condition of
effectiveness, the Project Coordinator and the Project Directors would have
been appointed, and the new regulatory system for the power sector would be
in full force and effect.
14.   Environmental Aspects. This is a category B project. No adverse
environmental effects are expected to result from the project since the majority
of works are renovations or substitution of existing facilities. The expansion
of the 500-kV system will consist of the installation of transformers in already
existing substations. An environmental analysis of UTE's transmission
program has been completed, and environmental safeguards were found to be
adequate. A report dated May 1994 entitled "UTE - Proyecto de Expansi6n
del Sistema de Transmisi6n 1994-2000, Estudio de Impacto Ambiental" has
been published and is now available to the public in Uruguay and in the
Bank's Public Information Center, in Washington, D.C. The modification of
the 150-kV system will include a change of equipment in existing installations
and the addition of underground cables and one compact substation, which
should produce no adverse environmental effects. The modernization of the
distribution network will consist of replacing old cables on the same site. The
Bank has helped UTE to prepare a diagnostic report on the environmental
status of its facilities (funded by Loan 3221-UR). Based on this report, a
restructuring of UTE's Environmental Unit was agreed during appraisal and
implemented by UTE in January 1995. This project would also help
strengthen UTE's environmental capability through a training program. One
important component of the proposed project would be the implementation of
UTE's Demand-side Management Program. Together with the Energy
Options Plan, also included in the project, this will allow UTE to develop a
satisfactory integrated resource planning exercise as a tool for an
environmentally safe and economically viable energy supply.
15.   Program Objective and Poverty Categories. The project would make
the development of the power sector in Uruguay environmentally sustainable
(Category EN) by creating conservation measures and reducing losses.
Successful implementation of the proposed project would also bring social
benefits by creating employment opportunities in the construction sector as
well as in transport, goods supply and other services to the project. Project
implementation would also improve power supply reliability resulting in better
efficiency for Uruguayan industry with increase in its competitiveness, which
could result in more jobs.



- 8 -
16.   Participatory Approach. The project preparation took into
consideration consultations with local communities. The environmental
analysis report, and the resulting final project design took into consideration
the results of those consultations.
17.   Project Benefits. By upgrading the antiquated power distribution
system in the Montevideo area, the project would improve power supply
reliability to industrial customers and hence help improve the efficiency and
competitiveness of the productive sectors. Institutional reforms supported by
the project would promote private sector participation in power generation,
which together with more effective demand-side management (also supported
by the project) would result in efficiency gains and improve the quality of the
electricity service to the majority of the population. The economic rate of
return is expected to be 15.4 percent.
18.   Risks. The project has no special technical risks. The Presidential
Decree creating the Energy Technical Commission was enacted as a condition
of negotiations. The new regulatory system being designed would create a
competitive market for power generation and its implementation is a condition
(spelled out in an agreement with Argentina) for uruguayan generators to have
access to the Argentine competitive power market. However, since the
creation of this new regulatory system is a condition of effectiveness, there is
the risk of delay in beginning project implementation if the Government delays
issuing those regulations. Risks of delays during project implementation have
been minimized by adopting a more realistic time schedule for implementation
in line with past projects experience, and by having already drafted bidding
documents for procurement of the most important items (representing 50% of
total project cost) and terms of reference for hiring consultants. Additionally,
UTE will hire consultants to assist with project implementation, reducing the
risks of delays even further.
19.   Financial Benefits. The borrower has considered the Bank's
alternative loan term options -- currency pool loan, LEBOR-based single
currency loan and fixed rate single currency loan terms -- and has selected
LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan terms, in order to improve the
management of its external liabilities. The choice of US dollar terms was
motivated by a better match between cash inflows and outflows in that
currency, which is the base of country external commerce. The LIBOR-based
single currency loan was considered preferable because of the long grace
period and final maturity offers. The borrower estimated that the risk posed
by the volatility of LIBOR-based single currency loan rating rate would be
mitigated in the medium range; short period higher rates would be
compensated by subsequent periods of lower ratio, averaging a rate in the






- 9 -
same order of the fixed rate. However, the much better grace period and
maturity would match better the life span of the proposed investments.
20.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
