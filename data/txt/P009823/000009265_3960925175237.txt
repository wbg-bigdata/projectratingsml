SUBJECT:    Project Completion Report on India
Fourth Trombav Thermal Power Prolect (Loan 2452-IN)
Attached is the "Project Completion Report on India - Fourth Trombay
Thermal Power Project (Loan 2452-IN)" prepared by the South Asia Region. Part
II was prepared by the Borrower.
This was the fourth Bank loan to the private Tata Electric Companies
(TEC) in Bombay, India. The US$135.4 million loan was approved in 1984. Less
than US$1 million was canceled.
The project was to reduce power shortages in the Western Region by
providing additional least-cost, efficient and environmentally benign thermal
capacity.  After an initial delay by Government in selecting the appropriate
technology, project implementation was uneventful. The ex post economic rate of
return was as forecasted at appraisal (13%).  The PCR concluded that besides
sector regulations conducive to private sector initiatives, project success
hinged on the previous experience and management quality of TEC.   The PCR
cautioned that environment issues should be handled prior to project launch to
avoid possible interferences by local environmental groups.
The PCR gives a thorough account of project implementation. Overall,
the project outcome is rated as satisfactory; its sustainability is deemed likely
in spite of recent interruptions in the supply of gas to the plant. Because of
its limited institutional objectives, the project institutional impact is
considered as negligible.
No audit is planned.

FOURTH TROMBAY THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2452-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth Trombay
Power Project in India, for which Loan 2452-IN in the amount of US$135.4
million was approved on June 6, 1984. The loan was made to the Tata Hydro-
Electric Power Supply Company Limited, the Andhra Valley Power Supply Company
Limited, and the Tata Power Company Limited, referred to collectively as the
Tata Electric Companies (TEC). The loan was guaranteed by India, acting by
its President. Implementation was delayed due to delays in choice of boiler
technology and creation of the security for the loan. The loan was closed on
June 30,1992, after two extensions of one year each. The extensions were
agreed upon by the Bank to allow TEC to complete payments for minor additions
brought to the project during implementation. Total disbursement under the
loan was US$134,409,077.98. The undisbursed balance of US$990,992.02 was
canceled on November 12, 1992, when the final disbursement under the loan was
made.
The PCR (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III) was
prepared by the Energy Operations Divisions, Country Department II (India),
South Asia Regional Office.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final
supervision mission of the project in February 1992, and is based, inter alia,
on the Staff Appraisal Report (No. 4536-IN), the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and Borrower,
internal Bank memoranda and the project completion report prepared by TEC for
its own internal evaluation and archives.

FOURTH TROMBAY THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2452-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Objectives
The main objective of the project was to reduce power shortages in
the Western Region by providing additional least cost, efficient and
environmentally benign thermal capacity. This objective was accomplished with
the installation of a 500 MW natural gas/low sulphur fuel oil fired unit (Unit
6) in the Trombay power plant, owned and operated by the Tata Electric
Companies. A further objective was to save fuel by eventually replacing old
and less-efficient units with a total installed capacity of 187.5 MW. This
objective was achieved by replacing base load generation with generation from
the more efficient new unit.
Implementation Experience
TEC successfully implemented this project which included the
construction of a 500 MW thermal power unit and its associated transmission
facilities. The unit was synchronized in March 1990 and reached its full load
in June 1990. The implementation period was twelve months shorter than the
previous unit of similar size (Unit 5), built under Ln. 1549-IN. However,
implementation was delayed by about twelve months with respect to the date
estimated at appraisal. This was mainly due to delays in the decision of the
Government of India (GOI) whether to adopt a new steam cycle technology and in
the creation of the security for the Bank loan.
Results
The project fully achieved its objectives: (i) the installed
capacity of the Western Region was increased by 4.3Z to 11,542 MW with the
installation of a 500 MW natural gas/low sulphur fuel oil fired unit (Unit 6)
in TEC's Trombay power plant, in Bombay; and (ii) generation from the new unit
began replacing base load generation from the less-efficient and less-reliable
older units. The project has also improved the reliability of power supply to
consumers in Greater Bombay and intensive load management measures have been
reduced.
The actual project cost was Rs. 4,595.4 million (US$335.9 million
at the average exchange rate of US$ - Rs. 13.68). In terms of Rupee the
project cost increased 17.7S, while it decreased 7.1? in terms of US$,
essentially due to the devaluation of Rupee with respect to the US dollar
(27.81 during the implementation period), reduction in customs duty for power
projects (from 651 to 30S) and decrease in international prices of machinery
and materials.



Sustainability
The project is clearly sustainable because the demand for its full
output exists since power is in short supply, particularly in the Greater
Bombay Area, where it has been increasing at about 8Z per annum. The present
tariff setting procedures allow tariffs adequate to recover capital and
operating costs and provide a certain profit margin for TEC, and TEC does not
have any accounts receivables problem. In addition, recent initiatives by GOI
and the Government of Maharashtra (GOM) to attract further private investments
to the power sector provide a sustainable basis for TEC to continue its
operations in an improved policy environment (Part I; paras. 34 and 35).
Findings and Lessons Learned
Major findings are as follows:
a)  The project was instrumental in enabling TEC to extend its license,
thereby preserving an important private element in India's power sector
(Part I, para. 5);
b)  GOI and GOM complied with their commitments to TEC and took no action
that would interfere with TEC's performance and adversely affect its
financial position, providing an excellent example for new private
investors interested in entering the power sector (Part I, para. 6);
c)  Use of the experience learned from the previous Unit 5 project, close
cooperation and coordination between TEC and its consultants on
preparation, supervision and monitoring during implementation, and
emphasis on quality assurance (QA) programs permitted TEC to complete
the project without delays beyond to those experienced at beginning
(Part I, para. 12);
d)  It is estimated by TEC that the cost of indigenous equipment procured
under international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance
with Bank guidelines was about 30Z lower than would have been if TEC
were to procure directly from the Indian domestic market (Part I, para.
16);
e)  The design of the project was modified to take into account of the
environmental aspects -- initially proposed to burn coal, gas and LSHS,
the unit was approved by GOI only for gas and LSHS, the height of the
stack was increased to 275 meters, and a modern electrochlorination
plant was installed to reduce impact of liquid effluents (Part I; paras.
23);
f)  In accordance with the clearance granted by GOI, the three oldest units
(187.5 MW) of Trombay power station were to be shut down and de-
commissioned, right after Unit 6 was put under commercial operation. In
view of the continuing shortages of power in Greater Bombay, GOI amended
its clearance in September 1991, so that these units would be retired in
1994, when a 180 MW combined cycle unit, currently under construction at
Trombay (Unit 7) is commissioned. Therefore, the units are currently
operated during peak periods (Part I; para. 23);



- iv -
g) The project assisted in the transfer of know-how through modifications
brought in the design of the steam turbine, adoption of micro processor
based controls for the power plant and the switchyard equipment,
installation of an environmentally benign and modern electrochlorination
system, and installation of gas insulated switchgear (Part I, para. 25);
h) If the present unreliability in gas supplies continues the Trombay power
station would risk to be operated at lower and non-optimal plant load
factors (Part I; para. 28);
i) TEC's financial position remained solid, with a long-term debt/equity
ratio of 1.6 maximum and a current ratio of 1.2 minimum. Debt service
coverage ration was 1.8 average through FY91/92, with a minimum of 1.7
in FY88/89. In FY91/92, however, the debt service coverage ratio
decreased to 1.3 due to a substantial increase in debt service
obligations on foreign loans. TEC financed about 20Z of its investments
from self financing (Part I, para. 33);
j) Successful completion of the unit within 4-1/2 years from the date of
award for the main plant equipment, was due to the fact that TEC
prepared the project well, spending about 5-1/2 years for preparing the
project, negotiating the loans and obtaining all necessary approvals and
authorizations from GOI, GOM as well as local authorities (Part I, para.
37);
k) TEC's strong position in the international and local financial markets
as well as its self financing capabilities and existing structural and
managerial strengths indicate that the Bank's involvement with the
company may be progressively phased out and TEC that should make more
use of commercial borrowing (Part I, paras. 38 and 39); and
1) The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) did not explicitly give certain
specific dates such as project starting, unit synchronization,
commercial operation and overall project completion dates, and this
shortcoming has prevented a detailed comparison with the actual
implementation and completion dates (Part I, para. 46).
Major lessons learned from this project are summarized below:
a) The major factor leading to successful completion of the project,
without additional delays, was the use of the previous experience
and efficiency and active involvement of TEC's management (Part I,
para. 12);
b)  Environmental issues should be taken into account right from the
beginning, otherwise actions brought by local environmental groups
might cause delays and additional costs (Part I; para. 13); and
c)  Appropriately designed, constructed and operated projects such as
the one covered under this loan, well established and managed
companies such as TEC, and GOM's fair execution of the Electricity
(Supply) Act and other related legislation provide an excellent
example to incite other private investors into the public power
supply sector (Part I, para. 35).

Background
1.          In India, responsibility for electricity supply is shared
constitutionally between the Government of India (GOI) and the states. In
addition, India is one of the few developing countries with a vibrant, if
small, private sector presence in public power supply. At independence,
private utilities and licensed local authorities, located in urban areas,
provided about 80 of public electricity supply. GOI opted to embark on an
ambitious electrification program, particularly in rural areas, and through
the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 (the Act) created the state electricity
boards (SEBs) and entrusted the state governments and the boards with primary
responsibility for public power supply. The Act also made the state
governments and SEBs responsible for regulating private utilities. All but
few remaining licensees consequently were taken over the expiry of their
licenses. No new licenses have been granted since 1956. Only five private
utilities remain: Tata Electric Companies (TEC), Bombay Suburban Electric
Supply Limited (BSES), Ahmedabad Electricity Company, Surat Electricity
Company, and CESC Ltd. (formerly Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation). All
but BSES generate at least some of the power they distribute ; their
installed capacity totals about 2,800 MW, and they provide less than 51 of
public supplies. In addition, Bombay Electric Supply and Transport
Undertaking (BEST), which distributes power in the southern parts of the city
of Bombay, is a department of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Bombay.
Furthermore, an estimated 6,250 MW of captive generating facilities are
operated by industries. The latter has developed in response to poor quality
and unreliability of public supplies. The SEBs are grouped into five regional
interconnected power systems. The Regional Electricity Boards coordinate
plant dispatch and inter-state power exchanges.
2.          The private power utilities are regulated by the Act, as amended
BSES is now in the process of constructing its first generating
facilities, a 2x250 MW coal-fired power plant at Dahanu, about
80 km north of Bombay, under a joint Bank/IFC operation (Loan
3344-2IN).

many times since 1948. Under the Act, licensees may set their tariffs to
recover their full operating costs, depreciation, interest and a return on
equity (para. 30). Their individual franchises are defined in licenses
obtained from their respective state government, which cover their geographic
area of operation and a term which was until 1991, normally of 20 years.
Since 1991, the term was amended by GOI to 30 years. TEC's operations are
regulated by the Government of Maharashtra (GOM). The generation and
transmission facilities of TEC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board
(MSEB) are operated within the Western Region2.
The Borrower
3.          TEC consists of three companies:
a)    The Tata Hydro-Electric Power Supply Company Limited (Hydro),
formed in 1910;
b)    The Andhra Valley Power Supply Company Limited (Andhra), formed in
1916; and
c)    The Tata Power Company Limited (Power), formed in 1919.
4.          The companies were formed by the two sons of Jamshetji Tata, who
were granted the initial licenses. Today the Tata group's holding company,
Tata Sons Inc., holds less than 2.5? of the companies total shares. The Tata
family owns less than 10? of Tata Sons. More than 75? of Tata Sons' shares
are held by Tata Trust, a charitable institution governed by a board of
trustees independent from the Tata family. Other individuals hold about 52.5?
of the shares of the companies. The balance (452) is held by the financial
institutions.
5.          In the 1950s, the three companies pooled their facilities and
their staff to form a single integrated grid connected to the Western Region.
Although, they have not actually merged, they are operated as one company
under the same management. They share their assets and liabilities, revenues
and costs in the same proportion (20? Hydro; 30X Andhra; 50? Power) and are
collectively referred to as the Tata Electric Companies (TEC). The three
hydro-electric power stations at Khopoli, Bhivpuri and Bhira are still
separately owned by the three companies under the original licenses issued in
1907, 1919 and 1921. The Trombay Thermal Power Station, the receiving
stations and the transmission and sub-transmission network are owned jointly.
The three companies operate the Trombay Power Station under the jointly owned
Trombay Thermal Power Electric License issued in 1953. TEC's licenses were
amended three times in 1978, 1985 and 1991 with the implementation of
different projects under Bank loans (Part III, Table 1). Under the Act MSEB
has the option to acquire, with appropriate compensation, the assets of the
undertakings covered by the licenses. This option is exercisable every 10
years, but not before August 15, 2010, the maturity date of the Bank Loan No.
3239-IN approved in June 1990 for the Private Power Utilities (TEC) Project.
2      The Western Region is formed of the generation and transmission
facilities of the State Electricity Boards of Madhya Pradesh,
Gujarat, Maharashtra and Goa. TEC's facilities are connected with
the system through MSEB's transmission lines. Ahmedabad and Surat
Electricity Companies are also connected to this regional system.



- 3 -
6.          The licenses are not exclusive. Other utilities may also be
licensed to distribute power in the same area. There are two such
distribution utilities in TEC's area (BSES and BEST) who are supplied by TEC
and retail power to 9 million consumers through their own distribution
networks. In addition, TEC supplies directly about 114 large industrial
consumers. About 70 more of these direct consumers located in TEC's area were
taken over by MSEB in 1980, because TEC did not have adequate capacity to
supply them. At that time TEC was importing about two thirds of its
requirements from MSEB, a dependence that has since decreased. TEC is still
in a deficit with respect to demand by about 1,600 GWh per annum and 400 MW on
average (about 182 of its sales in FY91/92). But the probability that TEC's
distribution rights may be truncated again by GOM and MSEB is considered very
low. MSEB has neither the financial incentive nor the financial resources to
take over more direct customers. In connection with the project, GOI had
agreed to cause GOM not to take any actions, including delimiting TEC's area
of supply, that would adversely affect TEC's operational performance and
financial position. Since then, GOM took no such adverse action.
7.          TEC generates, transmits and supplies power to large industrial
consumers and two distribution utilities in the Greater Bombay Area. The
quality of its power supply (as regards continuity, frequency, voltage) is
superior than those supplied by the public utilities. TEC is a well managed
corporation with strong financial performance and a good record of efficient
operation and maintenance. TEC's staffing is commensurate with the size and
scope of its operations. As of December 1992, TEC had a total of 3,960
personnel; out of which 151 were senior managers, 498 senior engineers, 544
assistant engineers, 2,360 skilled and semi-skilled labor and 407 non-
technical and administration staff. TEC provides extensive in-house and
external training to its personnel and to that of other utilities in India,
primarily for power plant operation. TEC has established an Environmental
Cell which follows environmental pollution control issues.
Project Objectives and Description
8.          Project Obiectives.  The main objective of the project was to
reduce power shortages in the Region by providing additional least cost,
efficient and environmentally benign thermal capacity. This objective was
accomplished with the installation of a 500 MW natural gas/low sulphur fuel
At appraisal, intensive load management was practiced in the
Greater Bombay Area, to restrict both demand and energy
consumption. Consumers were required to stagger their weekly
holiday, were allocated quotas of demand and energy and were
subject to disconnection if they exceeded their quotas.

oil fired unit (Unit 6) in TEC's Trombay power plant, in Bombay . When
commissioned in 1990, the project increased the total capacity of the Western
Region by 4.3Z to 11,542 MW. A further objective was to save fuel by
eventually replacing old and less-efficient units with a total installed
capacity of 187.5 MW. This objective was achieved by replacing base load
generation with generation from the more efficient new unit (para. 21).
9.          Project Description.  The project was an integral part of GOM's
least-cost program of alleviating power shortages in Maharashtra. It was
assigned to TEC because MSEB lacked the financial resources to build another
500 MW unit and the associated transmission system, at a time when MSEB waas
implementing the 2x500 MW extension of the Chandrapur thermal power plants
and developing its 400 kV transmission system. The project (Unit 6) consisted
of:
a)    a 500 MW single reheat steam turbine-generator set, complete with
auxiliaries;
b)    a boiler equipped to burn natural gas and low sulphur heavy stock
(LSHS) fuel oil;
c)    a circulating water system to extract sea water from Bombay
harbor, deliver it to the condenser of the turbo generator net,
and return it to the harbor;
d)    LSHS storage tanks;
e)    buildings for the turbo generator set and auxiliary plant;
f)    miscellaneous electrical and mechanical equipment;
g)    associated civil works;
h)    extensions to existing switchyards at Trombay power station and
Carnac receiving station; and
i)    the construction of a double circuit 220 kV part overhead/part
underground transmission system from Trombay switchyard to
Carnac in South Bombay and establishment of a 220/110 kV
switching station at Carnac.
The project was similar to and erected beside Unit 56 on reclaimed land,
owned by TEC, which was part of the original ash disposal area. There was no
resettlement. All the necessary infrastructure facilities were already
present and had only to be extended as necessary to accommodate the new unit.
4      Before the construction of this project, TEC's Trombay power
station had five units of different sizes either in operation or
under construction.
Units 1, 2 and 3   (3 x 62.5 MW)-  187.5 MW
Unit 4                            : 150.0 MW
Unit 5                            : 500.0 MW
Total (prior to Unit 6)           : 837.5 MW
With the commissioning of Unit 6 (500.0 MW) the total installed
capacity of the station reached 1,337.5 MW.
5      This 2x500 MW coal-fired power plant is being implemented under
the Bank Loan 2544-IN.

Project Design and Organization
10.         The feasibility report of the project was prepared jointly by TEC
and its consultants, Tata Consulting Engineers (TCE - paras. 41 and 42). The
project was initially proposed as triple-fired unit (coal, LSHS and natural
gas) but was finally cleared by GOI as a unit utilizing only clean fuels, viz.
LSHS and natural gas. In pursuit of higher fuel efficiency considering the
premium fuels to be burnt and with a view to introduce a new technology in the
country, TEC proposed the installation of a boiler with a steam cycle at
super-critical temperatures and a once through flue gases system. After
detailed studies and discussions, due mainly to technology transfer problems,
GOI, while granting the techno-economic clearance, opted for the established
sub-critical type steam cycle. The super-critical alternative would have
allowed 2Z improvement in the heat rate compared to the sub-critical option.
Nevertheless, TEC, TCE and the supplier brought modifications in many parts of
the design, such as increasing the reheat temperature and number of reheat
outlet headers, modifying design of the blades, reducing auxiliary fuel
consumption as well as increasing reliability, which permitted TEC to achieve
a net 21 heat rate improvement over Unit 5. The design was modified to take
into account environmental aspects (para. 23). The overall design of the
project reflects the current state-of-the-art of thermal power plants
technologies.
Project Implementation
11.         Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up.  Loan 2452-IN was
approved on June 6, 1984; the Loan and Guarantee Agreements were signed on
December 12, 19847. Creation of a security in favor of the Bank, in form and
substance satisfactory to the Bank, was a condition of effectiveness.
Government approvals required for the registration of the Trust Deed for the
creation of the security took longer than anticipated and the Loan was
declared effective only on July 31, 1985, a delay of 4-1/2 months from the
date of effectiveness originally determined at signing.
12.         Implementation Schedule.  The project was sanctioned by GOI in
June 1984, and was originally scheduled to be synchronized with the system by
March 1989. The appraisal report envisaged that the contracts for the main
plant equipment would be awarded during the first quarter of 1985. Because
GOI's lack of decision for nearly one year concerning TEC's "super-critical
steam cycle" proposal (para. 10), the orders for the turbine-generator and
boiler (with sub-critical parameters) were placed only in September 1985 and
December 1985, respectively. The unit was synchronized in 54 months8 from
the award of the turbine-generator contract in spite of intervening stoppage
of civil works and delays in deliveries (paras. 13 and 14). The major factors
leading to successful completion of the project were the close cooperation
between TEC and TCE and the active involvement of the engineering, operation,
maintenance, construction and quality assurance personnel of TEC at all stages
7      There are no records in the files describing the reasons why the
Agreements were signed six months after approval.
8      Compared to 66 months for Unit 5, because TEC used the experience
learned during the procurement and implementation of that unit.



of the project, right from preparation of feasibility report. The 220 kV
transmission system from Trombay to Carnac was completed and taken into
regular service in April 1988 (para. 24).
13.         Implementation Process.  The civil works were completed generally
as per schedule. In anticipation of the clearance of the project, TEC started
the preliminary works as early as January 1984. As an extension to an
existing power station, the need for infrastructure was minimal. Bidding
documents for civil works were issued only to prequalified contractors. The
progress of the civil works, particularly works for boiler foundations,
stopped for four months in 1986 when the Bombay Municipal Corporation issued a
Stop Work Notice at the instigation of local environmental groups. This
notice was withdrawn in August 1986 and TEC mobilized additional manpower and
financial resources to overcome the initial delay. The equipment suppliers
furnished the design data required for the foundations very early since a part
of the advance payment for the equipment was linked to furnishing the design
information. This helped to establish an uninterrupted flow of civil
construction drawings.
14.         The performance of all suppliers, most of them indigenous
manufacturers, was satisfactory, except that sustained follow-up was required
to obtain deliveries of delayed equipment. For each of the critical
equipment, suppliers were required to furnish intermediate milestone and
detailed activity charts which helped in monitoring their program. There were
delays on the part of the suppliers of boiler and turbine-generator in
placement of orders to sub-contractors and in manufacturing. Sustained
follow-up at the working level and frequent intervention by the senior
management of TEC and of the suppliers enabled delivery of equipment to meet
the commissioning schedules adopted at the date of awards. These delays,
though not critical for commissioning, resulted in need for simultaneous works
in various areas and a consequent strain on the project manpower. To
compensate for the above events, the equipment manufacturers increased
mobilization, augmented shifts and gave special emphasis on quality assurance
(QA) in order to ensure commissioning within the schedule.
15.         Procurement.  All procurement, under international competitive
bidding (ICB) as well as that advertized locally, was carried out
satisfactorily following the Bank's guidelines. Bidding documents and
recommendations for the award of contracts were prepared by TEC with the
assistance of TCE. Equipment and materials contracts (worth more than
US$200,000 each) financed under the Bank loan, were awarded under ICB. The
total number of contract packages procured under ICB amounted to 96, of which
41 were awarded to indigenous and 55 to foreign suppliers. Contracts worth
US$500,000 or more were subject to prior review by the Bank. In accordance
with the Loan Agreement, four contracts, each worth less than US$200,000 and
aggregating to US$2 million, were awarded on the basis of competitive bidding
advertized locally. As projected in the SAR9, qualified local contractors
won 72.6Z of the total procurement. The turbine-generator, financed under the
Japanese commercial credits, was procured under a negotiated contract, partly
from a foreign supplier, partly from a local supplier (para. 26).
9      Para. 3.15 and Table 3.2 of the SAR.



-7-
16.         All bidding recommendations of TEC and TCE were accepted by the
Bank. There were two instances of representation by bidders who were not the
lowest evaluated and acceptable bidders (circulating water pumps and high
pressure piping). These issues were clarified to the Bank with additional
information and the Bank accepted TEC and TCE's recommendations. Prices in
the procurement under local procedures were found to be competitive and the
delivery periods were within the overall timeframe. ICB procedures assured
that the equipment was available at competitive prices particularly from
indigenous manufacturers who had the facility, under such bidding and
financing conditions, to have these contracts treated by GOI as "Deemed
Exports' and hence to import raw materials required for the contracts free of
duty and to be paid other incentives. TEC estimates that the cost of
indigenous equipment was about 30Z lower (Rs. 300 million; about US$27.8
million) under ICB than would have if TEC were to procure directly from the
Indian domestic market.
17.         The appraisal report envisaged an import content of US$100
million. The final list included contracts amounting to US$76.6 million with
foreign su,pliers and imports amounting US$19.1 million by indigenous
suppliersl , thus amounting to US$95.7 million equivalent. The import
licenses on imported materials were released by the various ministries of GOI
in a sequential manner as all relevant conditions for such licenses were duly
and carefully followed. In consequence, no undue delay was experienced in
obtaining the import licenses when it was necessary.
18.         Project Costs.  The total cost of the project, including
contingencies, taxes and duties, was estimated in the SAR at about Rs. 3,903
million (US$361.4 million equivalent at the exchange rate of US$1 = Rs. 10.8),
of which about Rs. 1,085 million (US$100 million -- 28X) represented the
foreign exchange cost (Part III, Table 5A). The actual cost was Rs. 4,595.4
million (US$335.9 million equivalent at the exchange rate of US$ - Rs.
13.68)11, of which Rs. 1,309 million (US$95.7 million -- 28.5Z) were
expenditures in foreign currencies. In terms of Rupees, the project cost
increased 17.7?, while in terms of US dollars, it decreased 7.1? (about
US$25.5 million equivalent) due essentially to the devaluation of the Rupee
vis-a-vis the US dollar (27.8?), as well as reduction of import duties on
power projects (from 65? to 30Z) and international price decrease in imported
machinery and equipments (para. 16).
19.         Cost estimates included customs duty at a rate of 65Z on the cost
10     The imports by indigenous suppliers included computer systems,
timers and relays for critical controls, molded case circuit
breakers, sequence of event/fault disturbance recorders, castings
for large size valves, castings and forging for turbine parts,
high pressure piping and fittings, steam generator water
circulation pumps, etc.
11     The Rupee/US$ exchange rate which was Rs.10.8/US$ at the appraisal
time increased to Rs.30.0/US$ at the end of the project due to
continuous erosion of the value of the Rupee against the US
dollar. During the implementation period, the weighted average
rate was Rs.13.68/US$.



of imported equipment. In February 1985, GOI reduced the import duty
applicable for power projects from 65Z to 251; this was subsequently raised to
302.  Total taxes and duties were US$40.2 million, about US$32.1 million less
than the appraisal estimates.  Consequent to wage revisions, additional
manpower employed to complete the project in time and additional services
provided, actual project supervision and administration expenditures were
higher than the estimates.
20.          Disbursements.  The estimated and actual disbursements under the
Loan 2452-IN are given in Table 3, Part III. The delays which occurred at the
start and late deliveries of the main plant equipment adversely affected the
disbursements (paras. 13 and 14). In addition, the devaluation of the Rupee
vis-a-vis the US dollar resulted in reduced disbursements in terms of US
dollars. Therefore, actual disbursements were lower than the appraisal
estimates, which projected that the loan would be closed by June 1990. At
that time, the actual cumulative disbursement level was 90% of the total loan
amount. The closing date of the loan was extended twice by one year each, to
June 30, 1992. The extensions were agreed upon by the Bank to allow TEC to
complete payments for minor additions brought to the project during
implementation. Total disbursement under the loan was US$134,409,077.98. The
undisbursed balance of US$990,992.02 was canceled on November 12, 1992, when
the final disbursement under the loan was made.
Project Results
21.         Project Objectives.  Overall, the project was successful in
meeting its principal objectives of: (i) increasing the installed capacity by
500 MW, near Bombay where the demand growth is substantial, through a least
cost production technology and using environmentally clean fuels; and, (ii)
saving fuel by replacing the base load generation from the oldest units by
generation from the more efficient new unit. TEC estimates that US cents
2.15 is saved for each kWh replaced from the old units (442 GWh were replaced
during the April 1990 - December 1992 period; savings are estimated to have
amounted to about US$9.5 million).
22.         Physical Results.  The physical targets of the generation
component were achieved with one year delay, while there was no delay in
completing the transmission component. The project has improved the
reliability of power supply to the consumers in Greater Bombay and load
management measures have been relaxed, However, the Western Region continues
12
to be in deficit in power . At appraisal, synchronization of Unit 6 was
planned for March 198913. The unit was synchronized on March 23, 1990, and
attained full load on June 15, 1990, and as of December 31, 1992, it has
generated 7,499.7 GWh. The unit has been operating successfully at specified
efficiency. The transmission component was commissioned in October 1988 and
has been operating satisfactorily (para. 24).
23.          The project addressed several environmental aspects.  Initially
12     In 1991, underfrequency relays operated and shut down loads 403
times.
13      Para. 51 of the SAR.



proposed to burn coal, gas and LSHS, the unit was approved by GOI only for gas
and LSHS. The height of the stack was increased to 275 meters. A modern
electrochlorination plant was installed to reduce impact of liquid effluents.
In accordance with the clearance granted by GOI, the three oldest units
(3x62.5 MW) were to be shut down and de-commissioned, right after Unit 6 was
put under commercial operation. In view of the continuing shortages of power
in Greater Bombay, GOI amended its clearance in September 1991, so that these
units would be retired in 1994, when a 180 MW combined cycle unit, currently
under construction at Trombay (Unit 7) is commissioned  . The units are
currently operated during peak periods. In accordance with the original
clearance, the fourth unit (150 MW -- in operation since 1961) would be
relegated to stand-by duty and operated to meet peaking requirements only when
surplus gas is available for its operation.
24.         Completion of the transmission lines from Trombay to Carnac
improved the supply of South Bombay, reduced transmission losses and
overloading of transformers at Carnac and on the 110 kV lines and cables in
South Bombay, as well as wheeling of TEC's power through MSEB and thus
wheeling charges paid to MSEB. During the engineering of the project, it was
also decided to install 110 kV cables from Carnac to Backbay substation, also
in South Bombay, to enable transfer of power from Trombay to Backbay. These
cables were ordered along with other 220 kV cables and commissioned in October
1988.
25.         The project also assisted in the transfer of know-how through: (i)
modifications brought in the design of the steam turbine; (ii) adoption of
micro processor based controls for the power plant and the switchyard
equipment; (iii) installation of an electrochlorination system; and (iv)
installation of gas insulated switchgear. In addition, the computer based
project monitoring, reporting and management system developed and adopted for
the project, is now being used for the other projects undertaken by TEC.
26.         Project Financing.  Financing remained in line with the one
envisaged at appraisal (Part III, Table 5B). The Bank financed US$134.4
million (40.OZ) out of US$335.9 million of the total cost of the project,
including taxes, duties and interest during construction. Taxes and duties
were US$40.2 million. The share of the Bank funding was 45Z of the total
excluding taxes and duties. About US$45.4 million of the Bank loan covered
direct foreign exchange costs and the balance US$90 million, was used for
financing expenditures in local currency. The balance of the project
(US$201.5 million) was provided from: (i) a foreign commercial loan from
Japanese commercial banks (US$24.0 million); (ii) a loan from a consortium of
local financing institutions lead by the Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation of India (US$67.5 million): and, (iii) TEC's internally generated
funds and special reserves (para. 30; US$110.0 million). The Japanese loan
was utilized for financing the procurement of turbine blades, high pressure
turbine and the generator from Germany (45Z) and procurement of low pressure
turbine and other parts of the turbine-generator unit from a local
manufacturer, under a Rupee contract (para. 15). The Bank loan was used to
purchase the boiler and other components of the unit.
14     This unit is financed under the joint Bank/IFC operation for the
Private Power Utilities (TEC) Project (Loan 3239-IN).

27.         Economic Rate of Return.  The economic rate of returns of the
project can be calculated in different scenarios, such as the project serving
only TEC's system, or as an addition to the Western Region as a whole
(Scenarios 'A and 'B"). As India's power systems are planned on a regional
basis, economic analysis focuses primarily upon the Western Region, of which
the components of the project are integral parts. However, when prices are low
(as in India), demand and investment can be inflated above economic levels.
The project, treated as an addition solely to the TEC system and estimating
benefits on the basis of TEC's tariff, yields an ex-post economic rate of
return of 19.9Z less than the SAR's projection (23.5Z) due mainly to increased
fuel costs in FY92/93 (Annex 1.1). However treating the project as a part of
the Western Region as a whole, with the concomitant decrease in the average
tariff, increase in associated transmission and distribution expenditure and
increase in system losses, reduces the economic rate of return to 9.5z as
projected in the SAR (Annex 1.2). This return, however, is not a reflection
of the economic merit of the project because of the prevailing low tariffs.
Actually, consumers are willing to pay substantially more for reliable
electricity than the actual prices. If the consumers' willingness to pay is
incorporated (such as cost of alternative autogeneration or actual prices with
0.9 SCF correction), the economic rate of return increases to 13Z compared to
13.27 projected in the SAR (Annex 1.3).
Fuel Supply for the Trombay Power Station
28.         The Trombay thermal power station (para. 8) has been linked to a
committed quantity of 1.5 MMCMD/day of associated gas from the Bombay High gas
fields, 400,000 ton/annum of LSHS and 1.55 million ton/annum of coal. There
is also a further offer of 240,000 ton/annum of LSHS. These fuels are
adequate for the optimum operation of the plant. As the Guarantor of the
loan, GOI had ensured the Bank that it 'shall take or cause to be taken all
such action as shall be necessary to ensure the availability of adequate
supplies of suitable fuel for the optimum operation of the Trombay Power
Station" (Guarantee Agreement Section 3.03). Recently due to problems
experienced at the offshore gas fields, the amount of gas made available has
been lower and has somewhat affected the production at the station, as seen in
lower plant load factors (PLF)15.  TEC is taking appropriate measures to
secure additional quantities of LSHS and augment the delivery of coal (both
domestic and imported). However, if the present unreliability in gas supplies
is     56.47 PLF in FY90/91 and 60? in FY91/92.

continues, the Trombay station would risk to be operated at lower and non-
optimal plant load factor.

30.         As a licensee regulated under the Act, TEC is allowed to recover
through its tariff all operating costs, depreciation, interest expenses,
income tax, certain appropriations to statutory reserves (as defined under the
Act), any additional special reserves allowed by GOM and predetermined
'reasonable return, on its capital base. TEC's financial performance during
the period under review was significantly better than the SAR estimates
(Annexes 2; 2.1; 2.2; 2.3; 3.1; 3.2; 4.1 and 4.2).
31.         TEC's sales were higher than those projected in the SAR and
increased from 6,658 GWh in FY84/85 to 8,723 GWh in FY91/92 (312 increase in
total and 3.91 per annum on average), while TEC's generation increased by only
1,776 MWh (from 6,051 MWh to 7,827 MWh, an increase of 29.32 in total and 3.62
p.a. on average). Lower increase in generation was due to the one-year delay
in the commissioning of Unit 6 and inadequate fuel supply that TEC has been
experiencing lately (para. 28). Higher sales volume resulted from higher
purchases of power from MSEB (Annex 2.3). From FY84/85 to FY91/92, the price
of the power purchased from MSEB increased 3302 (from paise 59.27/kWh to paise
195.77/kWh). The current price is about twice the current cost of TEC's own
generation. The latter has been contained because of TEC's use of moderately
priced gas as the main fuel, as well as increased overall operating efficiency
due to higher efficiency of Unit 616.  Increases in TEC's tariff, however.
were only 792 (from paise 69.12/kWh in FY84/85 to paise 123.84/kWh in
7Y91/92).  In terms of US cents, TEC's tariffs decreased 152 between FY84/85
and FY91/92 (from US cents 5.59/kWh to US cents 4.76/kWh), while purchased
power prices from HSEB increased 572 during the same period (from US cents
4.79/kWh in FY84/85 to 7.53/kWh in FY91/92).
32.         TEC's revenues from the sale of electricity increased steadily
from Rs. 4,602 million in FY84/85 to Rs. 9,235.7 million in FY90/91 (201z),
compared to a 1642 increase in tariffs (from 66.44 to 108.86 paise/kWh) during
the same period. Comparison of sales and tariffs with those projected in the
SAR are given in Part III (Annex 2.3).
33.         TEC has had a strong financial position and has always serviced
its debt regularly and paid standard dividends. During the last four years
the dividend has been 182. Despite the low depreciation rates allowed under
the Act, TEC has had a comfortable cash flow level because GOM has allowed TEC
to charge a special reserve to meet the cash flow requirements to implement
its projects. The cash raised through this special reserve charged to tariffs
was about 1.8 times the amount of depreciation during the FY84/85-FY91/92
period. The majority of TEC's outstanding long-term debt is in foreign
exchange (over 652 in FY91/92), hence subject to revaluation in Rupee terms.
GOM has allowed TEC another special reserve for debt redemption which has
increased TEC's tariffs by less than 22. In FY91/92, as a result of the
devaluation of the Rupee, outstanding long-term debt increased substantially
thus debt/equity ratio to 2.4. However, with the conversion of partly
convertible debentures issued in May 1992. this ratio will return to its
previous level. Through FY90/91, the long-term debt/equity ratio was 1.6
is    During the last three years, the cost of gas increased by only 131
(from Rs. 2,059/ton to Rs. 2,329/ton) compared to a 632 increase
in fuel oil prices (from Rs. 3,195/ton to Rs. 5,125/ton).

maximum and current ratio 1.2 minimum. Debt service coverage ratio was 1.8
average through FY91/92, with a minimum of 1.7 in FY88/89. In FY91/92,
however, the debt service coverage ratio decreased to 1.3 due to a substantial
increase in debt service obligations on foreign loans. TEC financed about 20Z
of its investments from its own internal resources.
Project Sustainability
34.         The project is sustainable for the following reasons: (1) the
demand for its full output exists since power is in short supply, particularly
in the Greater Bombay Area; (2) the current tariff setting procedures and
tariffs are adequate enough to recover capital and operating costs, and
provide a certain profit margin for TEC; and (3) TEC's consumers pay their
bills. TEC has never had any accounts receivables problem. GOI and GOM's
recent initiatives to attract further private investments to the power sector
provide a sustainable basis for TEC to continue its operations in an improved
policy environment.
35.         Well designed, constructed and operated projects such as Trombay
Unit 6 and its associated transmission system covered under the project, well
established and managed companies such as TEC, and GOM's fair administration
of the Act and other related legislation provide an excellent example to
incite other private investors into the sector.
Bank Performance
36.         Through the Fourth Trombay Thermal Power Project, the Bank has
continued making appropriate contributions to the physical, technological and
institutional development of TEC. The performance of the Bank from the
project preparation through project completion was satisfactory. The Bank
supervised the project 12 times and continued to maintain excellent relations
with the Borrower which started in the 1950s. The joint Bank/IFC operation
for the Private Power Utilities (TEC) Project (Loan 3239-IN), approved in June
1990, is the only ongoing operation the Bank has with TEC. To date, the Bank
has assisted TEC in implementing a total of five projects with total
assistance of about US$365 million (Part III, Table 1). Throughout these
operations, the Bank has helped in strengthening the institutional and
financial viability of TEC, through a conditionality which included extensions
of operating licenses and establishment of special reserves for funding the
local currency requirements of the projects.
Borrower Performance
37.         Table 7, Part III contains the review of performance of the
Borrowers. The performance of TEC was satisfactory because it was able to
overcome many expected and unexpected implementation problems such as choice
of steam cycle technology, choice and adequate supply of environmentally
benign fuels, clearances from GOI, GOM, Municipal Authorities, etc., and avoid
additional delays by properly emphasizing on co-ordination, monitoring and
expedition of activities. All these measures played a vital role in the
completion of the project in accordance with the schedule revised at the time
of contract awards. Implementation of the project comprised more than 3,000
different steps and activities. Some specific areas which have played
critical role in the successful implementation of the project are:



- 14 -
-   Key operation and maintenance personnel were involved in the
design of the project to insure that feedback from their
experience about the construction, operation and maintenance of
the previous units, was built into the design and incorporated
into the specifications;
-   TEC continued its well proven practice of QA programs at
manufacturer's works. Shipping releases were signed after
detailed technical and QA inspections from the raw material stage
up to finished product. Inspections were carried out by a special
team of nine engineers from TEC and TCE; furthermore, part time
and full time individual consultants were employed. In addition,
operational personnel were also involved in equipment testing at
manufacturers' works and at the site;
-   The senior management and site management of TEC paid close
attention to the coordination and monitoring of all headquarters
and field activities, equipment supplies, transport, erection
services and other related matters;
A sound reporting system was established and daily reports from
various fronts at site were obtained. The analysis of these
reports provided the list of activities risking inordinate delays.
These were scrutinised and areas requiring management intervention
were highlighted to TEC's senior management which promptly took
the appropriate actions; and
Synchronization of Unit 6 within 4-1/2 years from the date of
contract award for turbine-generator, was preceded by a 5-1/2 year
period for preparing the project, negotiating the loans and
obtaining approvals from GOI, GOM and other Local Authorities.
38.         The financial strength of TEC has reached such a level that the
company could now finance its investment needs through commercial resources as
well as from its own self generated financing. TEC's financial strength
encouraged and allowed the company to borrow from IFC. The first project
covered transmission development. The second project was the above mentioned
joint Bank/IFC operation (para. 5). All the IFC loans, amounting to about
US$100 million, are fully disbursed and projects are progressing
satisfactorily.
39.         Finally, the implementation performance and financial strength of
TEC indicates that the Bank's involvement with the company should
progressively be phased out because of the company's strong position in the
international and local financial markets as well as its self financing
capabilities and existing structural and managerial strengths.
Project Relationship
40.         The Bank's relationship with the GOI, GOM and TEC has been good.
Consulting Services
41.         Tata Consulting Engineers (TCE) engineered the project in close



- 15 -
co-ordination with TEC. TCE is an international consulting firm owned by Tata
Sons Inc. (para. 4). TCE was also the consultant for the previous project and
its performance has been satisfactory. From initiation of the project till
1988, project engineering review meetings during which basic studies,
equipment specifications and layouts were finalized, were held monthly in
TCE's offices in Bangalore. Later these review meetings were held at site.
Construction engineers from TCE were seconded in specialist areas to form part
of the TEC project management and supervisory team. Consultants were also
responsible for full QA programs at contractor's works, and assisted in
expediting supplies from the manufacturers' works by furnishing periodic
reports and drawing TEC's attention to possible problems.
42.         While TCE carried out most of the engineering and project
supervision services in-house, it used the services of Monash University,
Melbourne, Australia, and Tileman & Co. Ltd., U.K. for the model studies and
design review, respectively, of the 275 meters high chimney which was
constructed for the first time in India. These services were financed from
TEC's own resources.
43.         In April 1991, the Loan Agreement was amended to include the
funding of the consultancy services for the review of the engineering of the
pumped storage projects in TEC's Bhira and Bhivpuri hydro power stations, as
the construction of these projects would result in enhanced utilization of
Trombay Units 5 and 6 built under Bank projects. Electricite de France
carried out these reviews. Similarly, engineering services for the
installation of a fly ash aggregate plant was also financed under Loan 2452-IN
as installation of this plant arose out of stipulations specified by the local
pollution control authorities. TEC obtained these services from Aaerdelite of
the Netherlands.
44.         The performance of all the consultants involved with this project
was satisfactory.
Project Documentation and Data
45.         The project's legal agreements adequately reflected the Bank's
interests in a satisfactory manner achieving the objectives of the project.
The staff appraisal report of the project provided a relatively useful
framework for both the Bank and TEC during project implementation. However,
the SAR did not explicitly give certain specific dates such as project
starting, unit synchronization, commercial operation and overall project
completion dates. This shortcoming has prevented a detailed comparison with
the actual implementation and completion dates. The three scenarios used in
the computation of IERR were not clearly tabulated and certain basic data were
missing. In addition, some errors have been noted in the financial statement
tables.
46.         TEC regularly submitted Quarterly Progress Reports for the
project. These have been used for review of physical and financial performance
as well as for planning the visits of the supervision missions to India which
often included site visits in addition to review meetings at TEC's corporate
office in Bombay.



- 16 -
47.         TEC has provided a comprehensive project completion report (seven
volumes) for the project and subsequent additional financial information. The
report consists of the technical details of the project, like a diary in which
every steps and every faces of the project, from the beginning to the end, are
detailed, problems studied and actions by various parties commented. It is a
unique document in its genre and a practical source and useful experience for
power engineers and power technicians. The report has been sent to Asia
Information Center.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Adequacy and Accuracy of Factual Information in Part III
48.         Part III covers statistical summary with six annexes regarding
related Bank loans, project schedule and implementation record, project cost
estimates and actual expenditure, status of covenants and economic analysis.
The data furnished in these annexes has been cross checked with the project
records and found to be in order, subject to substitution of financial data in
Annexes 2.1 & 2.2, 3.1 & 3.2, 4.1 & 4.2, as shown in the enclosed statements.
Comment on the Analysis Contained in Part I
49.         Analysis in Part I regarding project implementation and project
results are generally in order. It concludes (para. 39) that the
implementation performance and financial strength of TEC indicate that the
Bank's involvement with the Companies is progressively to be phased out. TEC
would like to highlight that the Bank's financing enables procurement of
indigenous equipment at substantially lower costs as manufacturers are
permitted duty free imports and the products are not subject to excise duty.
This ultimately translates to lower cost of electricity to the consumers but
this benefit is not available with commercial loans or from self-generated
financing. The ability to borrow is also related to the overall credit rating
of the country and the extent of borrowings permitted by the GOI. It is to
allow for these varying factors that TEC desires continued Bank involvement.
Further, the Bank's appraisal of any project proposal is so well respected by
other lending institutions that the fact that the Bank has agreed to lend
enables the Borrower to raise commercial loans and thereby lessen the burden
on the Bank. Therefore, phasing out of Bank's involvement is not advisable.
Evaluation of Bank's Performance and Lessons Learnt
50.         The project progress was monitored by periodic visits of Bank's
personnel twice a year during key phases of the project. The reviews were
professional and the quarterly reports required by the Bank were concise in
format and furnished to the Bank's satisfaction. Bank's response to purchase
recommendations forwarded by the purchaser was very prompt and all
recommendations of the consultants were accepted by the Bank. There were two
instances of representations by the bidders who were not the lowest evaluated
bidders. These issues were clarified to the Bank with additional information
and the Bank accepted the consultants' recommendations. The Bank was flexible
in regard to financing items not originally spelt out in the Loan Agreement
but found desirable for the project implementation. The evaluation of the
Bank's performance can therefore be deemed as excellent with very close
rapport between the project authorities and the Bank personnel.



- 18 -
Evaluation of Borrower's Own Performance and Lessons Learnt
51.         The project has been completed based on the original financing
pattern and within the estimated time schedule. The borrower's performance
can therefore be deemed as satisfying.
52.         Regarding profitability of TEC during the project period, it is
observed that towards the financial year ended March 1991, the profits after
tax and appropriations, substantially exceeded those forecast at the time of
appraisal by about 279? in 1990 and 3152 in 1991. This was mainly due to
expansion projects undertaken by TEC which were not envisaged and/or included
in the appraisal report. An increase was also evident in the financial year
ended March 1987 of 18? and of 96? in the financial year ended March 1988.
This resulted in increase in Capital Base which was also supplemented by the
deferment in the withdrawal of loans ftom the local financial institutions and
a substantial increase in the average inventories and cash balance held, which
were under-estimated at the time of appraisal.
53.         The lessons learnt during the project implementation period relate
to: (i) management of the local environment and clearances from local bodies;
(i) need to keep abreast of rapidly changing technologies; (iii) quality
control both at manufacturer's works and at site; and (iv) expediting with
local manufacturers.
54.         Local Clearances.  It was assumed that when the project was
cleared by the GOM and GOI that downstream clearances would follow in time.
However this was not so and there was a 4-month work stoppage in 1986 due to a
"stop work notice' issued by the Municipal Corporation. This was taken up
with the GOM on a war footing to issue necessary directives to the local
bodies and the clearances from the Department of Environment, Government of
Maharashtra, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board, etc., obtained. The
clearances required for setting up power projects are numerous, overlapping
between various agencies of the Government and required to be obtained
sequentially. The experience with clearances obtained on Unit 6 which
numbered over 52 has highlighted the need to streamline the procedure and
reduce the number of clearances. To avoid delay in implementation, it is
essential to plan and monitor closely all the clearances necessary from local
bodies.
55.         New Technologies.  The TEC initially proposed a supercritical unit
with the objective of attaining 2? higher efficiency. After nearly a year,
the GOI in May 1985 finally conveyed the decision for proceeding with
conventional parameters. Since further delays would have led to cost
escalation, TEC agreed to the same but still strived and attained higher
efficiency by adopting measures like higher reheat temperature, new designs of
turbine blading, LCI drives and ID fans, etc. The rapid increase in fuel
costs in the recent years has justified the continuing TEC efforts towards
achieving higher levels of efficiency and reliability. The ability of the
consultants to engineer individual systems of the power plant and procure the
equipment from original manufacturers rather than adopt a turnkey approach has
contributed to achieving a high overall plant efficiency and reliability.



- 19 -
56.         Quality Control.  The importance of quality control at
manufacturer's works cannot be overstressed and applies in equal measure to
both foreign and Indian manufacturers. By timely inspection at works and by
involvement of manufacturer's representatives in performance tests at site,
the required quality could be ensured. With foreign manufacturers sourcing
their components worldwide from Latin American/Far East, etc., and since the
supplies of 500 MW power plants represent the state-of-the-art technology
worldwide, quality control at manufacturers' works abroad even in Europe or
USA has now become even more important.
57.         Expediting.  The need for close expediting with indigenous
manufacturers was very clearly brought out during the course of project
implementation. While only one contract had to be cancelled and reordered,
deliveries from most of the suppliers were delayed. This was however foreseen
and contracts awarded well in advance of the due date. In the case of
critical items, purchaser's representatives were posted at suppliers works to
ensure timely deliveries and a separate cell of the project management was
responsible for expediting.
Relations Between the Bank and the Borrower
58.         As explained above, there was a very good rapport between the Bank
staff and the Borrower during evolution and implementation of the project.
Performance of Cofinanciers
59.         These included the Japanese leasing institutions who financed
US$55 million and local financial institutions whose loans totalled Re 98
crores. The local institutions with ICICI as the lead institution relied on
their own appraisal of the project. During implementation of the project,
they relied on the same reports as furnished to the Bank and had fewer
supervisory visits. Their disbursements were made in a timely manner at the
request of the Borrower.

In the appraisal estimates, the beginning date of the implementation
was not fixed; the generating unit scheduled to be synchronized within
54 months. The project implementation started on September 1985, and
reached synchronization within 54 months on March 23, 1990 and 3 months
later to full load on June 15, 1990. TEC implemented the project within
the projected time period, however, due to starting problems, there was
12 months delay in the implementation schedule compared to SAR.

In 1984, during the appraisal, the estimated cost of the project was about USS 361 million or Rs 3,898.5 million at the
exchange rate of USS = Rs 10.80. At the competion of the project, the actual cost was USS 335.9 million or Rs 4,595.4 million
at the average exchange rate of USS = Rs 13.68. Between appraisal and actual (1984-1992), the project cost, in terms of Rs,
increased 17.7% while the same project, in ternm of USS, decreased 6.8% due to essentially 27.4% of devaluation of the Rs,
reduction in custom duties and reduced contingency spendings compared to projections. At appraisal, the project cost estimates
included customs duty of 65% on imported equipment. In February 1985, GOI reduced the import duty for power projects from 65%
to 25%. This was subsequentLy raised to 30% but resulted in a saving of Rs. 364 million (USS 26.5 million). In SAR, taxes and
duties were included in "Price Contingencies". In actual position, TEC did not separate taxes and duties from Investment
costs. Taxes and duties are included in the investment cost items. In SAR, the total taxes and duties projected to reach to Rs
778.8 miLlion (USS 72.1 million at USS=Rs 10.8)). At the actual implementation, however, the taxes and duties amounted to Rs 550
mitlion or about USS 40.2 million (USS=Rs 13.68) which were USS 31.9 million less than SAR's projections.

The Bank's loan was disbursed more than 9M. Only, USS 990,992 of the loan was cancelled.
The project was completed about USS 32 million equivalent less than the appraisal cost due to
devaluation of Rs, icport duty reduction and depressed material and machinery prices.

Economic Impact                      Appraisal           Actual
Estimate            1991/92
Economic Rate of Return:
A. As a isolated project         23.5%              19.9%
B. Integrated Project             9.4%               9.5%
C. Integrated Project            13.2%              13.0%
Incuding Market Condit.
During the appraisal, the Economic Rate of Return was calcuLated in two ways:
a-) The project was treated as part of TEC system in isolation;
b-) The project was treated as an integral part of the Western Region.
Cost assurnptions were comwon to both. Alternative treatments related primarily
to benefits and are discribed in the following paragraph.
At Appraisal, Underlying Assumptions:
1. Shadow prices were based on the Standart Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.8.
Ratio of shadow wage to financiaL wage for unskilled Labor was 0.7.
2. Economic cost of the capital was derived from the financial cost of
the capital with shadow price coefficient (0.8);
3. Operating fuel cost was based on the appropriate prices of
Associated Gas, Residual Oil and Coal;
4  In economic terms, OLM costs were estimated 2% of the initial economic value
of the plant. Insurance was estimated 1% of the plant value;
5. Non-project-costs were assuimed 60% of the regional avarage. The
regional average represented 47% of expenditure on generating assets.
6. In the benefits side, two different scenarios were prepared:
- In idolation case (a-); 0.9 factor was used to the
prfce (57.64 paise/kwh x 0.9 a 51.9);
- In integrated case tb-); 0.8 factor was used for price
(53.6 paise/kwh x 0.8 z 42.9 palse/kWh.)
7. In Isolation case, losses comprised approximately 5% station use and 3%
transmission distribution use; the total of 8% of the gross generation.
S. In integrated case, 5% losses for station usa stayed the same. Transmission Losses,
however, amountd to 80% of the averags losses of the Western Region. Average Losses,
in Western Region, are 18% of the gross generation. Average project transmission
Losses: 0.8 x 18% * 14.4%. Totai losses for the project; 5%. + 14.4% * 19.4%.

Salient Features of 500 MW Unit 6
- New HP and IP Turbine Modules            |   Improved heat rate by 2Z.
- New turbine blade profile
- Reheat temperature of 565 deg C
instead of 538 deg C                     I
- 7 heater feed water cycle instead        |
of 6                                     I
- Variable speed drives using (Load             Reduced auxiliary power consumption
Commutated Inverters) for ID fans             d during part load operation
- Use of X-20 steel for main and hot       j   Reduced thickness of large pipes and
reheat piping in preference to                higher allowable stress at elevated
P22 steel                                I   temperature; permits faster start-
I   up, lower capital cost.
- Functionally distributed micro-               Higher reliability, increased
processor based I&C system as            I   functional capability, greater
well as a Data Acquisition System        I   flexibility, easier expendability,
reduced cabling and instruments
I   resulting in lower operating cost.
- Centralized Vibration Monitoring         I   Real time analysis and diagnostic
& Analysis System (152 channels)              aid to enable predictive
I   maintenance.
- Spring supported Turbine-Generator            Smaller size columns, reduction ln
Pedestal                                     number of pipes and reduction of
thickness of base raft.  Lower cost
and 3 months construction time
I   saved.
- 275 m high Chimney, instead of                As required by  the Emission
154 m                                         Regulations of GOI.

Dear Mr. Bauer,
Sub: Trombay 500 MW Unit 6
Loan No. 2452 IN
I refer to your letter dated 9th. March 1993
enclosing   Part   I   and  Part  III  of  the  Project
Completion Report (PCR), for fourth Trombay Thermal

Part II.    PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWERS PERSPECTIVE
A)   Adequacy and Accuracy of factual information in Part m
Part Ill covers statistical summary with 6 annexures regarding
Related bank loans, project schedule and implementation record,
project cost estimates and actual expenditure, status of covenants and
economic analysis. The data furnished in these annexures has been
cross checked with the project records and found to be in order,
subject to substitution of financial data in Annexures 2.1 & 2.2, 3.1
& 3.2, 4.1 & 4.2, as shown in the enclosed statements.
B)    Comment on the analysis contained in Part I of the PCR
Analysis in Part I of PCR regarding project implementation and
project results are generally in order. It concludes (Para 39) that the
implementation performance and financial strength of TEC indicate
that the Bank's involvement with the Companies is progressively to
be phased out. TEC would like to highlight that the Bank's financing
enables procurement of indigenous equipment at substantially lower
costs as manufacturers are permitted duty free imports and the
products are not subject to excise duty. This ultimately translates to
lower cost of electricity to the consumers but this benefit is not
available with commercial loans or from self generated financing.
The ability to borrow is also related to the overall credit rating of the
country and the extent of borrowings permitted by the Govt. of India.
It is to allow for these varying factors that TEC desires continued
Bank's involvement.
Further, the Bank's appraisal of any project proposal is so well
respected by other lending institutions that the fact that the Bank has
agreed to lend enables the Borrower to raise commercial loans and
thereby lessen the burden on the Bank. Therefore, phasing out of
Bank's involvement is not advisable.
C)    Evaluation of Bank's performance and lessons learnt
The project progress was monitored by periodic visits of Bank's
personnel twice a year during key phases of the project. The reviews
were professional and the quarterly reports required by the Bank
were concise in format and furnished to the Bank's satisfaction.
Bank's response to purchase recommendations forwarded by the
purchaser was very prompt and all recommendations of the
consultants were accepted by the Bank. There were two instances of
representations by the bidders who were not the lowest evaluated
bidders. These issues were clarified to the Bank with additional
information and the Bank accepted the consultant's recommendations.

The Bank was flexible in regard to financing items not originally
spelt out in the Loan agreement but found desirable for the Project
during implementation.
The evaluation of the Bank's performance can therefore be deemed as
excellent with very close rapport between the project authorities and
the Bank personnel.
D)   Evaluation of Borrowers own performance and lessons learnt
The project has been completed based on the original financing
pattern and within the estimated time schedule.  The borrowers
performance can therefore be deemed as satisfying.
Regarding profitability of TEC during the Project period, it may be
observed that towards the financial year ended March 1991 ,the
profits after tax and appropriations, substantially exceeded those
forecast at the time of appraisal by about 279% in 1990 and 315% in
1991 . This was mainly due to expansion projects undertaken by TEC
which were not envisaged and/or included in the appraisal report.
An increase was also evident in the financial year ended March 1 98 7
of 18% and of 96% in the financial year ended March 1988. This
resulted in increase in Capital Base which was also supplemented by
the deferment in the withdrawal of loans from the local financial
institutions and a substantial increase in the average inventories and
cash balance held, which were under-estimated at the time of
appraisal.
The lessons learnt during the project implementation period relate to
i)   Management of the local environment and clearances from
local Bodies.
ii)   Need to keep abreast of rapidly changing technologies.
iii)   Quality control both at manufacturer's works and at site.
iv)   Expediting with local manufacturers

Local Clearances
It was assumed that when the project was cleared by the Govt. of
Maharashtra and Govt. of India that downstream clearances would
follow in time. However this was not so and there was a 4 month
work stoppage in 1986 due to a 'stop work notice' issued by the
Municipal Corporation.  This was taken up with the GovLof
Maharashtra on a war footing to issue necessary directives to the
local bodies and the clearances from the Dept. of Environment,
Govt. of Maharashtra, Maharashtra Pollution Control Board etc.
obtained. The clearances required for setting up power projects are
numerous, overlapping between various agencies of the Govt. and
required to be obtained sequentially. The experience with clearances
obtained on Unit 6 which numbered over 52 has highlighted the need
to streamline the procedure and reduce the number of clearances. To
avoid delay in implementation it is essential to plan and monitor
closely all the clearances necessary from local bodies.
New Technologies
The TEC initially proposed a supercritical unit with the objective of
attaining 2% higher efficiency. After nearly a year, the Govt. of
India in May 1985 finally conveyed the decision for proceeding with
conventional parameters. Since further delays would have led to cost
escalation, TEC agreed to the same but still strived and attained
higher efficiency by adopting measures like higher reheat
temperature, new designs of turbine blading, LCI drives for ID fans
etc. The rapid increase in fuel costs in the recent years has justified
the continuing TEC efforts towards achieving higher levels of
efficiency and reliability.
The ability of the Consultants to engineer individual systems of the
Power Plant and procure the equipment from original manufacturers
rather than adopt a turnkey approach has contributed to achieving a
high overall plant efficiency and reliability.
Quality Control
The importance of quality control at manufacturer's works cannot be
overstressed and applies in equal measure to both foreign and Indian
manufacturers. By timely inspection at works and by involvement of
manufacturer's representatives in performance tests at site the
required quality could be ensured.  With foreign manufacturers
sourcing their components world wide from Latin America/ Far East
etc. and since the supplies of 500 MW power plants represent the
State of Art technology world wide, quality control at manufacturers'
works abroad even in Europe or U.S.A. has now become even more
important.

EzMditing
The need for close expediting with indigenous manufacturers was
very clearly brought out during the course of project implementation.
While only one contract had to be cancelled and reordered, deliveries
from most of the suppliers were delayed. This was however forseen
and contracts awarded well in advance of the due date. In the case of
critical items, Purchaser's representatives were posted at suppliers
works to ensure timely deliveries and a separate cell of the project
management was responsible for expediting.
E)    Relationship between the Bank and the Borrower
As explained above, there was a very good rapport between the
Bank's staff and the Borrower during evolution and implementation
of the Project.
F)    performance of Co-financier
These included the Japanese leasing institutions who financed
55 Million $ and local financial institutions whose loans totalled
Rs. 98 crores.  The local institutions with ICICI as the lead
institution relied on their own appraisal of the project.  During
implementation of the project they relied on the same reports as
furnished to the Bank and had fewer supervisory visits.  Their
disbursements were made in a timely manner at the request of the
Borrower.

Part I      PROJECT REVIEW FROM BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
Background
1.   Para 1/ line 20 - BEST is a department of MCGB.  The word
'department" is misssing.
19.   Procurement! line 10
In accordance with the loan, four contracts each worth less than
US $ 200,000 and aggregating to US $ 2 million were awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally. The word 'four'
is missing.
