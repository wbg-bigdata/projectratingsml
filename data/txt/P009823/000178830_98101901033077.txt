Proiect
Description:             The project is designed to further the progress of
India's long-term power generation expansion program
through the provision of additional generating
capacity in the Western Region to help reduce power
shortages there, and to replace existing generators
scheduled to be retired in the late 1980s, resulting
in substantial fuel savings. The project provides
for the construction and installation at Trombay
(near Bombay, in the State of Maharashtra) of a
second 500 megawatt thermal power generating unit,
comprising a turbogenerator, a steam generator,
electrical and mechanical equipment, and associated
works. There are no risks other than those normally
associated with this type of project.

FOURTH TROMBAY THERMAL POWER PROJECT
I.   THE POWER SECTOR
Background
1.01    The development of India's economy and the improvement of its
people-s standard of living depend to a large degree on the development of
the power sector. Over the last two decades, power demand has grown twice as
fast as the economy, and the power sector now takes the largest share of
public investment; about 20% of the outlays of the Sixth Five-Year Plan are
expected to be invested in the power sector. This growth was due mainly to
the rapid development of power-intensive industry and the expansion of rural
electrification for irrigation. In spite of an increase in generating
capacity from 5,600 MW in 1960 to about 38,000 MW in 1983, power shortages
have been experienced in various parts of the country for a number of years,
and gaps between supply and demand will impose major constraints for some
years to come.
1.02    Before 1975, power facilities were planned, constructed and operated
independently by each State to meet its own needs. Because of the rapid
growth of the power sector which the State Electricity Boards (SEBs) were
unable to cope with, the Government of India (GOI) decided to create new
institutions in the sector, and to emphasise central planning of generation
and high voltage transmission with the ultimate objective of central control
through a national grid. The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) performed
studies of a national power system, and GOI decided to proceed with the
construction of four large centrally owned thermal power stations located at
coal fields, supplying bulk power to the States through an interconnected 400
kV transmission system.  The construction of these power stations (2,000 MW
at Singrauli, 2,100 MW at Korba, 2,100 MW at Ramagundam and, ultimately, 2100
MW at Farakka) was begun with Bank Group financial assistance. The first
phase of the program comprised construction of a 600 MW station at each site,
together with associated transmission facilities. IDA Credits for the second
stages of Singrauli (1,400 MW) and Korba (1,500 MW), and a Bank loan for the
second stage of Ramagundam (1,500 MW), have also been approved.
Bank Group Participation in the Past
1.03    The Bank has made 16 loans for Indian power projects, amounting to
US$1,547 million, and 17 IDA credits totalling US$2,409 million (Annex 1).
Seventeen projects financed under the following loans and credits have been
completed: ten generating projects, the Beas Project (Credit 89-IN), the
first four transmission projects (Loan 416-IN, Credits 242-IN, 377-IN and
604-IN) and the First and Second Rural Electrification Projects (Credits
572-IN and 911-IN). The Fourth Transmission Project (Credit 604-IN) was
completed in 1983 and the Second Rural Electrification Project in 1984. The



-2-
Third Trombay Thermal Power Project (Loan 1549-IN), Singrauli (Credit
685-IN), Korba (Credit 793-IN), and Ramagundam (Credit 874-IN and Loan
1648-IN) Thermal Power Projects are in an advanced stage of implementation.
The credit for the Second Singrauli Thermal Power Project (Credit 1027-IN)
and the credit/loan for the first stage of the Farakka Thermal Power Project
(Credit 1053-IN and Loan 1887-IN) were approved in May and June 1980. Korba
II (Credit 1172-IN) was approved in July 1981, Ramagundam II (Loan 2076-IN)
in December 1981 and the Third Rural Electrification Project (Loan 2165-IN)
in June 1982. The Upper Indravati Hydro Project (Credit 1356-IN and Loan
2278-IN) was approved on May 10, 1983, the Central Power Transmission Project
(Loan 2283-IN) on May 17, 1983, and the Bodhghat Hydro Electric Power Project
on May 17, 1984. The Third Rural Electrification Project is about a year
behind schedule. The first five units of the Singrauli Project and the first
two units of the Korba project were commissioned on schedule. The Farakka
and Ramagundam Projects are proceeding satisfactorily, the first unit at
Ramagundam having been commissioned four months ahead of schedule. The Third
Trombay Project (Unit 5) was first synchronized in January, 1984, about a
year behind schedule; time was lost mainly by late delivery of parts of the
boiler, and by delays in erecting it.
Strategy of the Bank Group in the Indian Power Sector
1.04    The Bank Group's strategy in the Indian power sector has been to
cooperate with GOI in finding solutions to the many difficult and politically
sensitive problems confronting the Indian electricity supply industry. The
Bank-s main objectives in the sector are:
(a) to eliminate power shortages by the instlallation of generation
and transmission capacity, and the promotion of measures to
improve the operation and maintenance oi- existing plant;
(b) to introduce long-range system planning on a nationwide
basis so as to assure implementation of a least-cost power
development program;
(c) to promote improvements in sector organization and training;
and
(d) to strengthen the finances of the institutions in the sector,
particularly the State Electricity Boards.
1.05    The States, through their Electricity Boards, develop and operate
most power facilities. Under the Constitution, power supply is a concurrent
subject, which means that responsibility is shared between the Central
Government and the State Governments, requiring full agreement between them
before action can be taken. Despite many difficulties, improvements achieved
so far have been encouraging. With the establishment of Regional Electricity
Boards (REBs), the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and the National



-3-
Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC), important steps towards an
improved organizational structure of the power sector have been made. CEA
was reorganised and its powers enlarged; amendments in the financial
provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948 clarified the requirements
to be followed in tariff setting, the financial performance of SEBs
improved; the majority of SEBs have completed tariff studies based on
marginal cost pricing principles; CEA has prepared a national long-term
power development plan; and the increased investment in the sector will
help eliminate the power deficits.
1.06    Because of the rapid expansion of the power industry, all aspects
of the sector needed to be reviewed and solutions found for its various
problems. GOI established in 1978 the Committee on Power, which submitted
its conclusions to GOI in September 1980. They refer to all major aspects
of the power sector including planning, project formulation and implemen-
tation; operation and maintenance; organization and management; finance,
financial management and tariffs; rural electrification; and research and
development. The recommendations of the Committee on Power, most of which
are satisfactory in light of the Bank Group's strategy, form a basis for
improvement of all those aspects of the power sector.
1.07    In accordance with undertakings agreed during negotiations for the
Second Korba Thermal Power Project, GOI furnished, in May 1982, a program
for the implementation of five categories of power sector improvements
which the Bank Group considered areas of high priority. Satisfactory
progress has been made in these five areas for which some of the more
recent activities and achievements are as follows.
(a) Performance of Thermal Power Plants
The Department of Power in 00I has established teams of
specialists, including representatives from CEA, SEBs and
manufacturers, to visit all thermal power plants with 100/120
MW and 200/210 MW generating units in the country to diagnose
technical and operational problems, propose solutions and
assign responsibilities for their implementation. Repeat
visits are planned to assess progress.
(b) Coordination of Power Development and Growth in Other Sectors
The Bank Group received the draft Long Term Power Plan (LTPP) for
power development in September 1982. This plan provides fore-
casts of power demand, and projects the generating capacity and
equipment that will be required to meet this demand. It will
provide the basis both for five-year plans and annual investment
programs.

(c) Intensification of Hydro-Electric Power Development
GOI is progressing with plans for a number of hydro projects,
some of which will be proposed for Bank Group financing and
others for bilateral assistance. Several projects - among them
Vishnu Prayag (UP), Lohari Nag (UP), Naphtha Zhakri (HP),
Puyan Kutti (Kerala), and Lower Periyar (Kerala) - have reached
advanced stages of project preparation. The 600 MW Upper Indravati
project (Orissa), the first hydro power project in India
proposed for Bank Group financing, was approved on May 10, 1983.
The 500 MW Bodhghat project (M-P) was approved on May 17, 1984.
GOI is planning to begin investigations on what would be one of the
largest hydro power projects in the wor:ld - the 15,000 MW Dihand
project in north eastern India, where a number of other projects are
also under consideration.
(d) Strengthening the role of the Central Sector in Power Generation
and interstate High Voltage Transmission
(i) GOI, through NTPC, has under conlstruction and partly
in operation about 10,000 MW of power generating
capacity. In addition to the four Bank Group-financed
thermal stations at Singrauli, Korba, Ramagundam and
Farakka (which, except for Farakka, are now in their
second phases of construction), a 1000 MW plant at
Rihand (UP) and a 1260 MW plant at Vindhyachal (MP) are
also being undertaken by NTPC. Agreements have been
signed with the UK and USSR, respectively, for the
financing of these plants. A 600 MW plant near Delhi
is also under consideration by NTPC.
(ii) The Central Power Transmission project will reinforce
the Centrally owned power transmission grid, and provide
the first stage of integration of the Northern, Western
and Southern regional grids, taking into account
compatability for eventual energy pooling.
(e) Establishment of Financial Objectives and Policies for their
Implementation; Principles for Evolving Rational Tariff Policies;
and Improvements in Management Information and Accounting Systems
for State Electricity Boards.
(i) Legislation for amendment of the financial provisions of
the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 was enacted by GOI
in August 1983. These amendments will remove some of the
anomalies in the Act which have resulted in the SEBs all
following different and inconsistent accounting practices,
thereby rendering their financial performance impossible
to measure or compare.



-5-
(ii) Management consultants have completed a review of present
accounting practices in two of the SEBs (Punjab and
Gujarat); they are now engaged in developing a uniform
system of commercial accounting for adoption by all SEBs.
Their review included preparation of a draft accounting
manual by January 1984 which will form the basis of the
new accounting system scheduled for introduction in
1985. CEA is charged with monitoring the development
of the new accounting system and the financial
performance of the SEBs.
(iii) With the Third Rural Electrification Project, approved
in June 1982, new financial performance criteria for
the SEBs were introduced. These were designed to
provide for reasonable contributions by the SEBs to
power investment, and to reduce gradually State
Government subsidies for rural electrification losses.
Consumption and Supply - Western Region
1.08    The Project will be located in the Western Region, where the major
supply authorities are the Gujarat Electricity Board (GEB), the Madhya
Pradesh Electricity Board (MPEB) and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board
(MSEB), all of which are publicly owned. Other suppliers are the beneficiary
of the loan, Tata Electric Companies (TEC), Ahmedabad Electric Co., and Surat
Electric Co. Ltd. Of the total of 10,043 MW installed in the region in
1982/83, 8,367 MW (83%) was owned by individual SEBs. Private utilities
owned 950 MW (10%); 306 MW (3%) was owned by the Central government; and the
remaining 420 MW (4%) was in the Tarapur atomic station. Thermal stations
accounted for 78% of the capacity, hydro 18% and the remainder was nuclear.
1.09    The Western Regional Electricity Board (WREB) has its headquarters
in Bombay where it is constructing a Regional Load Despatch Center, partly
financed from Credit 604-IN, which is intended in due course to operate
generating facilities throughout the Region by remote control. The WREB
advises on exchanges of power and energy between the States in the Region and
coordinates cooperation between them. Fully integrated operation of the
Region's facilities is still some years away and is not likely to occur
before there is adequate generating capacity available in each of the member
States.
1.10    Industrial consumers take about 65% of the electrical energy sold in
the Region, residential and commercial consumers 15%, agricultural consumers
12%, and street lighting, public works and traction loads take the remaining
8%. Agricultural consumers have in the past decade doubled their share of
total energy consumed, and residential and commercial consumers have also
increased their share, while industrial consumers have experienced a



-6-
reduction. The suppression of load made necessary by shortage of generating
capacity has a greater effect on industrial than on other classes of
consumer. Irrigation pump sets in the Region increased in numbers from
340,000 in 1971 to 1.2 million in 1981.
1.11    Load growth in the Western Region over the period 1950-1981 averaged
10.3% per year, slightly more than the average of 9.7% for the whole country.
In the period 1971 to 1981 the region averaged 7.37%, also a little above the
national rate of 6.35%. CEA's load forecast in the Long Term Power Plan
(LTPP) was made by aggregating separate forecasts for each section of the
economy. Industrial consumption, about 60% of t:he total, is dominant and two
different scenarios of industrial growth were considered. The high one
corresponds to a growth of value added in mining and manufacturing of 7%
compounded from 1979/80 to 2000/01, while the low scenario corresponds to a
growth rate of 5.5%. The rates of load growth derived for the Western Region
are given in Table 1.1. The relatively high rates in the early years are
attributable to satisfying suppressed demand. The Region's forecast growth
from 1980/81 to 1984/85 is rather less than the national average, reflecting
a forecast of very strong growth in that period for the Northern and
North-Eastern Regions.

1.12    The peak demand in the Western Region is forecast in the high
scenario to grow from 7,143 MW in 1982/83 to 19,540 MW by 1994/95, an average
rate of increase of 8.75%. Depending on the assumptions made about forced
outage rates and the rate of development of hydro power that can be achieved,
between 19,000 and 25,000 MW of additional generating capacity will need to
be installed in the region by 1995 to maintain acceptable loss of load
probability (LOLP). The total installed capacity in the Western Region at
end March 1983 was 10,043 MW, and committed projects totalled a further 6,992
MW, of which 6,680 MW was thermal. Further new projects identified for the
LTPP studies but not yet sanctioned totalled 12,153 MW, of which 6,270 MW was
thermal (Annex 2).

Demand and Supply - Maharashtra
1.13    Maharashtra, where the project will be located, has suffered serious
shortages of electricity over the past ten years, arising at first from low
hydro production due to relatively low rainfall, and latterly from lack of
generating capacity. Intensive load management is practised to restrict both
demand and energy consumption. Consumers are allocated quotas of demand and
energy, and are subject to disconnection if they exceed them. MSEB estimates
that in 1980/81 the energy sold was 4,530 GWh less, and the peak load carried
was 1,040 MW less, than they would have been without restrictions. The
following table shows the restrictions currently imposed by the State on
industrial consumers.

1.14     All consumers in the State are supplied from the interconnected MSEB
and TEC systems. The total number of consumers on the MSEB system in March
1983 was 4,155,000. TEC, which supplies only large industrial consumers and
other licencees, had 114 consumers and supplied a restricted maximum demand
of 1,180 MW. Since TEC's generating capacity was only about 622 MW it had to
purchase up to 600 MW to meet the restricted demand of its consumers. The
maximum demand served by the system in 1982/83 was 3,296 MW, and the energy
generated and purchased (from Karnataka and Gujarat) was about 21,051 GWh.
Transfers of energy to and from MSEB in 1982/83 are given in Table 1.3.

1.15     About 25% of India-s industry is concentrated in Greater Bombay.
In the Trombay area the expansion of fertilizer, chemical and oil refining
complexes is expected to increase demand from 200 MW in 1982/83 to 400 MW in
1986/87. In the southern part of Bombay city, high rise commercial and
residential buildings are being erected on reclaimed land. The area between
Bombay and Tarapur includes growing load centers such as Tarapur Industrial
Estates where about 400 units with an aggregate demand of 200 MW are expected
to be established.  Growth is anticipated in other developing parts of the
State such as Pune, Ratnagiri, Kolhapur and Khopoli. Rural electrification
is also proceeding rapidly.
Maharashtra Power Sector
1.16    Prior to 1954 the more populous areas of Maharashtra were supplied
by private electricity undertakings operating under license. Bombay State
ElectrI zity Board (BSEB) was formed in 1954 and took over supplies in Gujarat
and part of Bombay. In 1956 its area was extended to include parts of Madhya
Pradesh, Hyderabad and Kutch. In 1960 BSEB was split to form Gujarat
Electricity Board (GEB) and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The
private electricity undertakings were gradually taken over and the principal
ones now left in Maharashtra are Tata Electric Companies (TEC), Bombay
Suburban Electric Supply Undertaking (BSES) and Bombay Electric Supply and
Transport Undertaking (BEST), which is a department of the Municipal
Corporation of Greater Bombay. There are a few small areas in Maharashtra
still served by private distribution companies, but these will be taken over
-by MSEB as their licences expire. Generating facilities in the State are
operated by MSEB and TEC. The major licencees operate within their
concession areas and MSEB generates and distributes electricity throughout
the rest of Maharashtra. The licencees other than TEC distribute only,



buying their power in bulk from MSEB and TEC. TEC is the largest licencee
and operates its own generating stations with a total installed capacity of
622 MW, not including the 500 MW Unit 5 in Trombay which was first
synchronized in January 1984 and is in the commissioning process. TEC is
unable to meet the demand on its system and purchases up to 600 MW of
additional power from MSEB. The power is purchased at three points: Trombay,
Kalwa and Borivli. TEC supplies energy in bulk to textile mills and other
large industries, as well as to distribution licencees and local authorities
in Bombay. TEC supplies about 70 MW to the Indian Railways system and about
350 MW to MSEB at four substations for distribution.  It also supplies power
within the areas of other licencees to individual consumers whose demands
exceed the following limits:
Licencee                    Supplied by TEC
BSES                        All consumers above 1,000 kVA
BEST                        All consumers above 250 kVA
Map IBRD 17276 illustrates the areas of supply of the licencees.
1.17    The Indian Railways system is connected with TEC-s system at Kalyan.
Chola, an old power station owned by Indian Railways, has an effective
capacity of 40 MW, and provides about 25 MW to the Railways. The balance of
15 MW is sold to a group of consumers, mainly textile manufacturers who,
because of current power restrictions, are prepared to pay higher prices for
Chola power.  It is transmitted via the Tata System,  and charges are
collected by the Mill Owners- Association and passed to Indian Railways via
TEC, which applies a wheeling charge of 7%. The TEC system is interconnected
at three points with the MSEB system, which in turn is interconnected with
the Gujarat system bv a double circuit 220 kV line, and with the Madhya
Pradesh system via a single 132 kV line. Future planning provides for all
three State systems to be interconnected at 400 kV.  TEC operates its own
load despatch center at Trombay, and MSEB operates load despatch centers at
Kalwa and Ambazari.
Existing Facilities
1.18    MSEB-s and TEC's existing generating facilities are listed in
Table 1.6 below. At the end of January 1984 MSEB had 15 power stations with
a total installed capacity of 4,655 MW, including Koyna and other hydro power
stations leased to MSEB by the State Government for operation and
maintenance. TEC has five power stations with a total installed capacity of
1122 MW, including the 500 MW Unit 5 at Trombay.   Additionally, there is the
Tarapur Nuclear Power Station with a capacity of 420 MW, the output from
which is shared by MSEB and GEB, and Chola (40 MW) which is connected to the
TEC system.

1.19    The total length of medium and high voltage transmission lines and
underground cables (11 kV and above) operated by MSEB at March 31, 1982 was
about 112,900 circuit km, and by TEC about 1,403 circuit km. The aggregate
capacity of transformers of 11 kV and above operated by MSEB was around
17,900 MVA and by TEC was about 3,500 MVA. The TEC system, which comprises
110 kV and 220 kV transmission lines, is tied in with MSEB's 220 kV network
at three points with an aggregate stepdown capacity of 1,250 MVA, comprising
10 auto transformers each of 125 MVA. In March 1983 MSEB was supplying
4,155,000 consumers, of which about 2.7 million were domestic.
Future Development

1.21    The total length of the various sanctioned 400 kV transmission lines
in Maharashtra is about 2611 circuit km, which includes 1514 circuit km of
the Koradi-Kalwa scheme. Besides this, a 400 kV interstate link from
Chandrapur to Ramagundam is under consideration. NTPC is also constructing
400 kV lines from Koradi to Bhilai and from Koradi to Satpur.
Rural Electrification
1.22    Maharashtra has been one of the more progressive States in the
promotion of rural electrification. During the 1970s an average of some
1,500 villages and 44,000 irrigation pumpsets were energised every year.
There are just over 36,000 towns and villages in the State and the number
electrified increased from 853 in 1961 to more than 32,000 in 1982. The
Project, which will provide 500 MW of power for the Maharashtra system, will
contribute to the continuing program of rural electrification.

IT.  THE BORROWER   THE TATA ELECTRIC COMPANIES
2,01    The Borrower of the proposed Bank TLoan woiuld be TEC; and,  OI would
serve as guaraTntor.
2.02    TEC consist of three companies:
(a) The Tata Hydro Electric Power Supply Company Limited (Tata
Hydro), form,ed in 1910;
(b) The Andhra Valley Power Supply Company Limited (Andhra Valley),
formed in 1916; and
(c) The Tata Power Company Limiited (Tata Power), formed in 1919.
The Companies are separate puolic-shareholder owned, private sector entities
which operate as a group under the same management.  They form a part of the
Tata Group of enterprises which have substantial financial resources, an
excellent credit rating, first-class managerial ability and a long and
successful history of operations in many industrial, mercantile, service and
non-profit enterprises in India. The Tata Grou'p, however, owns less than
3% of TEC and is not obligated to stand behind 'FEC-s borrowings. TEC's
credit worthiness depends on GOM's sanction. of a Special Appropriation for
Debt Redemption, established under the Third Trombay Thermal Power Project
(Loan 1549-1N), and renewed under the Project (para 4.26).
2.03    The three Tata Electric ComDanies have pooled their resources to form
a single interconnected grid; the three hydro-electric power stations (Table
1,6) are owned seDarately by the individual companies; and the Trombay
Thermal Power Station, the receiving stations and the transmission and
distribution network are owned jointly in the ratio of 20:30:50 by Tata
THydro, Andhra Valley and Tata Power respectively.
2.04    Each of the three Tata Companies operates its individually owned
hydro plant separately under an individual licetse (Bomtbay Hdrdro Electric
Ticenrse issued in 1907, the Andhra Valley Hydro Electric License issued in
19i9 and the Nila Mula Valley Hydro Electric License issued in 1921); and the
three companies operate Trombay under the Jointly owned Trombay Thermal Power
Electric License  Tro-ombay License) issued in 1953.  M.SEB has the option to
purchase the undertakings covered by the li.censes; currently, the earliest
date on which MSEB  anri exercise the option is June 30, 2000.  As this date
falls during the lifetime of the proposed loan. 0OM has assured GOI that
TEC's 71cense and franchise will be extended for a period up to the life of
the Bank loan.  At negotiaticns,  OI agreed to take alil steps necessary to
ensure that by December 31, 1985, TEC9s license will be extended by GOM to
August 15, 2004), the maturity date of the proposed loan.

2.05    During appralsal and negotiations of -Loan 1549-IN, TEC, and GOM
(acting through the agency of MSEB) agreed to a two stage program  for
rationalising electricity distribution within TECzs area;
(a) the first, which reduced the rumber of consumers served by
TEC from 214 to 114, took effect in July 1980 and has already
been implemented; and
(b) the second, which is due to take effect in July 1985.
In the second stage, TEC and MSEB have agreed to begin discussions in July
1984 to arrive at a mutually acceptable agreement for further delimitation of
TEC's licensed area; also, both have agreed to the guiding principle that TEC
would be allowed to retain the right to retail as much power as can be
justified by loads in their area.  Such an adjustmeent should not adversely
affect TEC's financial operations since if their customer base were further
reduced substantially, the Companies would sell their resultant surplus power
to MSEB. In connection with the proposed loan, GOT has undertaken that GOM
will take no action, including delimiting TEC-s area of supply, that would
interfere with TEC's performance or adversely affect its financial position.
Security Arrangements
2.06    Annex 3 shows TEC's borrowing position and the priority of existing
liens on its properties as at March 31, 1983, The Bank loan (Loan 1549-IN)
for the first 500 MW unit at Trombay has been secured by mortgage, charge and
floating charge on TEC's assets at the Trombay Thermal Power Station
(including the 500 MW unit), the Trombay Housing Colony and the Trombay
License. TEC-s other borrowings for that same first 500 MW unit are secured
by a mortgage, charge and floating charge on all of their assets and all
their joint and separate Licenses. The three Companies- other debentures are
secured by a mortgage, charge and floating charge onl the respective assets
and licenses of each, including their respective interests in the assets and
licenses jointly owned by them.



-14-
2.07    At negotiations the Bank received TEC's agreement to the following
security arrangements for the proposed loan:
(a) A first specific mortgage on the properties, plant, equipment
and other fixed assets to be provided under the proposed
project;
(b) A first mortgage on all assets provided under TEC-s first
500 MW project as well as those subsequently added thereto,
pari passu with the existing liens in favor of IBRD, the
Indian Financial Institutions, State Bank of India, GOM and
others in respect of the borrowings for the said first 500 MW
project;
(c) A charge/floating charge on all other immovable and movable
assets at the Trombay Thermal Power Station and the Trombay Housing
colony, pari passu with the charges/floating charges for the
various separate debentures issued by TEC's constituent
companies (see Annex 3, page 1, items (a), (b) and (c) of the
table); and
(d) Assignment to IBRD by way of mortgage of the Trombay License
including extensions and renewals thereof, pari passu with
the security for the aforesaid borrowings for the first 500 MW
project.
These security arrangements are based on those used for Loan 1549-IN. TEC
will use a Mortgage by Trust Deed; GOI agreed to arrange a waiver of the
Stamp Duty on the creation of the Trust Deed on TEC's properties in favor of
the Bank. Creation of an acceptable mortgage is a condition of effectiveness
for the proposed loan. As the Mortgage by Trust Deed will require some
considerable time to create, in order not to delay the Project, the Bank has
agreed to accept an Equitable Mortgage for the purposes of effectiveness of
the loan. TEC's execution of the Equitable Mortgage will be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan. At negotiations, TEC gave an undertaking
that it will execute a Trust Deed in favor of the Bank within one year from
effectiveness of the loan. The proposed IBRD mortgage, charge and floating
charge will be shared pari passu with the Indian Financial Institutions,
local commercial banks, an as yet unspecified external Financier (assuming
that this participation is taken by a commercial lender and not a supplier
creditor), and other sources of financing for the proposed project. As for
the first Rs 250 million of TEC-s current assets, IBRD has obtained a
subordinate mortgage, charge or floating charge, subject to the priority of
the charges created or expected to be created by TEC in favor of their
commercial bankers; IBRD has obtained a primary mortgage charge or floating
charge, to be shared pari passu with the other lenders denoted above, on all
current assets which may exceed Rs 250 million. This treatment of current



-15-
assets should enable TEC to raise short term borrowings to obtain the
liquidity necessary for the ordinary conduct of business.
Organisation and Management
2.08    TEC's organization chart is shown in Annex 4.  The Tata Electric
Companies are well managed utilities and are operated in accordance with
sound commercial principles. Each Company has a separate Board of Directors
consisting of ten people, four of whom have seats on all three - namely, the
Chairman, the Vice Chairman and Managing Director, and the two Deputy
Managing Directors. The last three of these officials also serve as
management of all three companies. One GOI representative and one GOM
representative serve on the Board of Andhra Valley; and one additional GOM
representative also serves on the Board of Tata Power. Each of the three
companies also has a representative of the Indian Financial Institutions on
its Board. The remaining members on TEC's Boards consist of representatives
of leading industrial and banking interests in India. The Boards of the
three Companies hold joint Board meetings.
2.09    The technical and managerial services of the Companies have been
integrated into one common system. In addition, the Companies have an
integrated common staff which numbered 2842 on June 30, 1983, including 86
senior management; 141 senior engineers; 554 assistant engineers, operators
or technicians; 1,509 skilled and semi-skilled workers; and 552 non-technical
administrative personnel. This staffing pattern is reasonable given the
scope of TEC's operations.
2.10    The present management and staff have a history of operating the
companies efficiently. They have managed the Third Trombay Project (Loan
1549-IN) effectively. They are competent to execute the proposed project
with some assistance from consultants if needed (para 3.09) and to carry out
other works covered by TEC-s development program. However, because of its
unique organization, TEC agreed at negotiations to inform the Bank prior to
making any major changes in either the structure of its organization or the
scope of activities to be handled under TEC's aegis.
Training
2.11    TEC provides extensive training, primarily for power plant operations
personnel. TEC believes that the efficiency and quality of operation of the
advanced generating plants now being installed depend on the ability of
operating staff to understand and perform the necessary plant control
operations, quickly and in accordance with stipulated sequences, during
normal and emergency conditions.
2.12    TEC's program for power plant operators  training includes some
classroom lectures on theory and as well as practical in-plant observations;
the most important component of the program, however, is training on unit



-16-
simulators. The first, designed and constructed by TEC, replicates Trombay's
150 MW Unit 4. Under the Third Trombay Power Project (Loan 1549-IN), TEC
installed a second fully computerized simulator to replicate the responses,
interlocks and operations sequences of the 500 MW Unit 5.  This new simulator
gives trainee operators experience in handling abnormalities which may be
encountered in the actual operation of the plant. TEC is using these
facilities to train not only its own personnel, but also many thermal station
operators of various SEBs as well as students from the training schools
operated by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA).
2.13    TEC also provides on-the-iob training for transmission and
distribution personniel and for its administrative and clerical staff. For
these categories of staff. TEC relies on traininig facilities and programs
obtained from external agencies.  TEC does not provide formal traininig for
accounting staff as the Companies- needs are normally met from the large
reservoir of adequately trained locally availab'Le accounting specialists.
2.14    TEC uses a modern digital process computer system for load control
which provides instant-by-instant control of the entire process of power
generation; and Trombay-s load despatch center is staffed by well trained
engineers. Load despatch centers similar to TEC-s are now being installed
by the States and Regions as part of the prograri for developing a national
power system. TEC is planning to introduce a training program, using its
facility at Trombay, for selected SEB engineers to acquire on-the-job
experience in load despatch.
2.15    TEC have recently established a manpower development center at Washi,
about 10 km fromn Trom'bay, where special training sessions are held on power
system management. Also, from time to time, TEC sponsors their engineers
and managers for participation in managemen.t courses conducted at the Tata
Management Training Center in Pune as well as at the Administrative Staff
College of India at Hyderabad.
Audit
2.16    The audit of accounts of TEC's three constituent companies has been
conducted annually by independent auditors appointed by the Companies at
their Annual General Meetings, in accordance with the requirements of the
Companies Act 1956. The appointed auditors have been members of the Indian
Institute of Chartered Accountants and qualified within the meaning of the
Chartered Accountants Act 1949, Messrs. A.F. Ferguson and Co. and Messrs.
S.B. Billimoria and Co. of Bombay were reappointed auditors of the Companies
at the Annual General Meeting in September 1983, to examine and audit the
accounts of the companies for 1983/84.  These auditors are acceptable to the
Bank.  At negotiations, TEC agreed that they will continue to have their
accounts audited by acceptable auditors and that they will furnish the annual
audit together with accompanying report to the Bank within six months of the
end of the relevant financial year.



-17-
Internal Audit
2.17    TEC maintains an active internal audit unit which functions
independently of its financial staff and reports directly to top management.
This unit primarily verifies the proper accounting of transactions; however,
it also makes recommendations to top management regarding whether certain
accounting procedures and policies are appropriate (because TEC's accounting
procedures are closely regulated under the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948, the
internal audit unit does not have latitude to recommend substantial changes).
TEC-s internal audit activities are satisfactory to the Bank.
Management Systems and Procedures
2.18    TEC maintains highly sophisticated internal control systems and
procedures. These enable management to manage their departments accurately
and troubleshoot problems with a minimum of delay. TEC's systems and
procedures, which are exemplary, are acceptable to the Bank.
2.19    Because TEC has only 114 consumers purchasing electricity directly,
the Companies have not had problems with billings and collections. They
follow a system which is thorough, well conceived and easy to implement. As
a result, TEC's accounts receivable have been averaging about one month's
sales, a level which is excellent.
Insurance
2.20    TEC maintains substantial insurance on its assets, both those under
construction and in operations. The practises it currently follows are
acceptable to the Bank. At negotiations, TEC agreed that it will maintain
adequate insurance for those goods and services being financed under the
proposed project.

III. THE PROJECT
Objectives
3.01    The objective of the Project is to further the progress of the
least-cost generation expansion program in India-s Western Region, by the
rapid and economical installation of another large, efficient generating unit
near Bombay. This objective will be accomplished primarily by providing TEC
with generating capacity to replace their older generators. Units 1, 2 and
3, rated at 62.5 MW each, have already run between 160,000 and 175,000 hours
each; and by the time the projected Unit 6 comes on line in 1988/89, they
will range in age from 27 to 31 years, substantially more than the 25 years
often taken as the normal useful life span of such plant. Despite having
been very well maintained and rehabilitated as far as possible, these units
have experienced troubles such as cracks in boiler drums and some large steam
valves, creep in high pressure turbine casings and flange bolts, ageing of
insulation in generators and transformers, and thinning of condenser water
boxes and tubes. They have already had to be derated and operated at reduced
steam pressure, and their thermal efficiency has dropped off substantially.
These units cannot continue indefinitely in base load service and will be
downgraded to intermittent duty and later to reserve status. The 150 MW Unit
4 also has achieved a high level of utilisation, and has run more than
138,000 hours. By the time that Unit 6 comes on line, Unit 4 will have been
in service more than 22 years, and will also be approaching the time when it
too will have to adopt a reduced duty cycle.
3.02    A further objective of the project is to save fuel.  The replacement
of these older units by a new unit operating on higher steam conditions will
result in substantial fuel savings. Units 1 to 4 produce about 2,000 GWh per
year; the same amount of energy generated by thie projected unit would consume
about 110,000 tons of oil equivalent less per year.
Project Description
3.03    The proposed Unit 6 would be very similar to Unit 5 and would thus
reap the benefits of being a repeat of an existiLng design. However, in
pursuit of even higher fuel efficiency, TEC has proposed as an alternative
and GOI is considering the use of a supercritical steam cycle with a "once
through" boiler. If this alternative is found to be economically justified
and is adopted, Indian utilities, manufacturers and consultants would benefit
from the introduction of technology new to the c:ountry. Because Unit 6 is
not expected to burn coal in the early part of its life, the purchase will be
deferred of equipment needed only to burn coal, such as bunkers, pulverizers,
coal and ash handling plant, and electrostatic precipitators, but physical
provision is made to add them later; these items are not included in the
Project.



-19-
3.04    Unit 6 will be erected beside Unit 5 on reclaimed land, owned by TEC,
which was part of their ash disposal area. All the necessary infrastructural
facilities are already present and have only to be extended as necessary to
accommodate another unit. The Project would consist of:
(a) a 500 MW single reheat steam turbo generator set complete with
auxiliaries;
(b) a steam generator equipped to burn oil and gas, but designed to
burn coal, oil and gas, having provision for the future addition
of coal burning equipment, an electrostatic precipitator, and
gas scrubbers;
(c) a circulating water system to extract sea water from Bombay harbor,
deliver it to the condenser of the turbo generator set, and return
it to the harbor;
(d) fuel oil storage tanks;
(e) extensions to existing 220 kV and 110 kV switchyards and a short
220 kV transmission line;
(f) buildings for the turbo generator set and auxiliary plant;
(g) miscellaneous electrical and mechanical equipment; and
(h) associated civil works (Annex 5).
3.05    The output from the project will be fully used by TEC's own
consumers; however, the plant will be interlinked with the MSEB system, which
is interconnected with the GEB and MPEB systems to form the Western Region.
The combined capacity of these three systems in 1988/89, when Unit 6 will
come into service, will be about 15,500 MW and the peak demand at that time
is estimated to be about 11,000 MW. The new unit will thus constitute about
3% of the capacity installed in the Region and about 6% of the capacity of
the TEC - MSEB system. Stability studies have been performed and indicate
that the TEC - MSEB system will be able to withstand satisfactorily the
tripping of a 500 MW unit. Load flow and transient stability studies have
proved the adequacy of the TEC - MSEB transmission network, as it will be
developed, to handle the demand under all specified conditions.
Project Cost
3.06    The estimated cost of the project is Rs 3,902.4 million (US$361.4
million), including the Bank's front end fee but exclusive of interest during
construction of about Rs 889 million (US$82.3 million) (para 4.14). The
foreign cost component is estimated at Rs 1,084.8 million (US$100.5 million).
The estimates (Annex 6) were based on the actual prices paid for Unit 5,



-20-
adjusted for inflation to March 1984.  For the steam generator, prices
tendered in 1983 for the Ramagundam units of the National Therrnal Power
Corporation (NTPC) were used as a starting point:, since these prices were
substantially higher than an estimate arrived at by taking Bharat Heavy
Electricals price for the Trombay Unit 5 steam generator and applying
escalation.  For the turbo generator set, TEC obtained an updated price from
Kraftwerk Union, the manufacturer of Unit 5. The project estimate provides
for 220 kV transmission to South Bombay and integration of the new unit with
TEC-s 110 kV system.
3.07    Physical contingencies of 5% were applied to electrical and
mechanical work, and 10% to civil works. An amount of Rs 102.9 million
(US$9.5 million), which includes contingencies and taxes, is included in the
estimate to cover the possibility that it may be decided in the interest of
greater fuel economy to employ an extra high (or supercritical) steam
pressure. The physical contingencies amount to 5.4% of the base cost. The
price contingencies applied were based on foreign escalation rates of 3.5%
for calendar 1984, 8% for 1985 and 9% for each year 1986 to 1988; local
escalation rates were taken as 8% for 1984/85, 7% per year for 1985/86 to
1987/88, and 6% for 1988/89. The price contingencies amount to 22.3% of the
base cost plus physical contingencies. Taxes and duties included amount to
Rs 778.8 million ($72.1 million); the total project cost net of taxes and
duties is estimated at Rs 3,123.6 million (US$289.2 million). The following
table summarises the project costs.

Project Financing
3.08    The financing plan (paras 4.13-4.19) assumes a Bank loan of US$135.4
million equivalent, which is 47% of the cost excluding duties and taxes and
interest during construction (see para 4.14). About US$55 million equivalent
of financing will be sought from commercial banks or suppliers- credits. The
balance would be provided from internally generated cash of Rs 875 million
(US$81.0 million) and by contributions from local financial institutions of
Rs 972 million (US$90.0 million).
Engineering and Construction
3.09    The Project will be engineered by Tata Consulting Engineers (TCE),
who engineered Unit 5, with some assistance from experienced foreign
consultants if necessary in areas where TEC may not have sufficient
experience. If a supercritical steam cycle were adopted for Unit 6, foreign
consultants would be retained to advise on any technology new to TCE. The
Project would be implemented over a period of about five years (Annex 7).
Part of the land to be reclaimed for the unit is already diked off, and TEC
are proceeding with the remaining dikes and filling, so that piling and civil
works can start as soon as possible. They expect to have Unit 6 in
commercial operation by mid-1989. TEC have demonstrated competence in
project management during the construction of Unit 5.
Fresh Water
3.10    The Bombay water supply system is being expanded, and no difficulty
is foreseen in meeting Trombay's needs. Nevertheless the municipal supply
will be conserved by tapping ground water for general services, recirculating
water where possible, and using sea water where it is acceptable instead of
fresh water.
Fuel
3.11    During the negotiations of Loan 1549-IN, GOI undertook to ensure the
availability of (a) adequate coal supplies for Unit 5 at its full capacity,
and (b) rail transport facilities for up to 2 million tons of coal each year
for that unit.  At negotiations of the Project, GOI undertook to ensure the
availability of adequate supplies of suitable fuel for the optimum operation
of Trombay Power Station. Supplies of associated natural gas from the Bombay
High oilfield are available at Trombay, as also are supplies of residual fuel
oil from nearby refineries. At present there are surplus supplies of these
two commodities and they are furnished as fuel to TEC. Neither the limits to
the supplies of these fuels, nor the extent of the demand for them which may
develop from other users, is yet known, but it is likely that Trombay will
burn some oil and gas for a number of years to come. The design of Unit 6
will incorporate the features necessary to permit the addition of everything
required to burn coal when the time comes for it to do so.



-22-
3.12    At present, 400,000 tons per year of residual fuel, known as Low
Sulphur Heavy Stock or LSHS, are supplied for Units 1, 2 and 3 by Bharat
Petroleum Corporation Ltd. (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPC).
BPCL and HPC are expanding and from 1984 about one million tons per year of
LSHS will be produced.  It is expected that some of this will be burned by
TEC until such time as other uses of the fuel become established.
3.13    The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has a gas pipeline to
TEC-s power station, and since 1978 has been supplying the existing units
with associated gas from the Bombay High oilfield as and when it was
available. The present supply is about 320,000 tons per year. TEC is so far
the only user for much of this fuel, which would otherwise have to be flared.
New consumers will be taking quantities of gas in the next few years, but new
oil and gas finds also are being made. Although, ONGC can give TEC no firm
commitment about supplies, it seems that for some years there may be no
market except TEC for a large part of the associated gas.
3.14    Trombay is equipped to receive coal by rail.  The allocation for Unit
4 is 180,000 tons per year; recent receipts have been 11,247 tons in 1979/80,
none in 1980/81, 76,950 tons in 1981/82 and 33,845 tons in 1982/83. This coal
comes from Central Coalfields Ltd., and the allocated source for Unit 5 is
the Singrauli coalfields. Indian Railways now have facilities to deliver up
to about 2.3 million tons of coal per year to Bombay. Units 4, 5 and 6
together will consume fuel equal to between 1.3 and 1.5 million tons of fuel
oil equivalent per year. To meet this by coal, after allowing 20X oil to
maintain ignition, would require about 2.8 million tons of coal per year.
Studies have shown that it would be technically feasible to carry coal by sea
from Haldia near Calcutta, or alternatively from Paradeep, to Trombay.
Should it be decided to use sea-borne coal, a special jetty for unloading
this coal would be constructed.
Procurement
3.15    The Bank loan will be used to finance equipment and materials.  The
packaging of contracts is expected to be similar to that for Unit 5, when
Bank financing applied to about 50 tender calls involving about 95 orders.
All contracts for equipment or materials to be financed by the Bank, except
those worth less than $200,000 each, will be awarded after international
competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Bidding
documents and recommendations for the award of contracts would be prepared by
TEC with the assistance of Tata Consulting Engineers, and those worth
$500,000 or more would be subject to prior review by the Bank. Local
manufacturers are expected to bid for all categories of equipment, and a
domestic preference of 15% or the import duty, whichever is less, would be
applied in bid evaluation. Local manufacturers are likely to win the
majority of contracts. Contracts worth less than $200,000 each and with an



-23-
aggregate value of $2,000,000 may be awarded using TEC's local competitive
bidding procedures, which are satisfactory.

1/ Contracts will be awarded after Limited International Bidding procedures.
2/ Competitive procurement arrangements are not applicable.
Disbursements
3.16   Disbursements from the Bank loan would be made against 100% of the
CIF cost of imported goods and services and 100% of the ex-factory cost of
domestically manufactured goods. The estimated schedule of disbursements is
given in Annex 8. Although the disbursement profile is shorter than the



-24-
Bank's standard profile, it is patterned on TEC's actual recent experience in
constructing Unit 5 and it is reasonable.
Environment
3.17   When GOM extended TEC's licenses and approved the first 500 MW unit at
Trombay, TEC was required to ensure that the unit being built under the
project as well as the existing thermal units at Trombay complied with
specified pollution control requirements. TEC has duly installed
electro-static precipitators of 99.5% efficiency, which are adequate for the
first 500 MW unit. TEC will take all measures necessary to ensure that the
execution and operation of the Project are carried out in accordance with the
standards of the relevant national, state or local authorities. The location
of Unit 6 is adjacent to the existing Trombay Power Station in an industrial
area on the outskirts of Bombay on coastal reclaimed land. There is no
residential property in the near vicinity and no resettlement is involved.
Prevailing winds are offshore. TEC has provided an environmental impact
statement to GOI's Department of Environment.
3.18   Unit 6 will be a replacement for four older and less efficient units
which are to be retired, and the increase in the amount of fuel to be burned
is equivalent to that required for only 50-70 MIW. Environmental Protection
Agency regulations in the USA limit emission of sulphur dioxide to the rate
of 2.16 gms/million calories during coal firing and 1.6 gms/million calories
during oil firing. These limits can be met by using coal containing up to
0.6% sulphur or oil having up to 0.4% sulphur. The Singrauli coal which will
be used has a sulphur content of only 0.15 - 0.25%. Unit 6 will have
provision for an electrostatic precipitator of 99.5% efficiency and a stack
152 m (500 feet) high, with an exit velocity of 25 metres per second, giving
an effective height of plume rise of 400 metres. Ground level concentrations
of sulphur dioxide and particulate matter with both 500 MW units at full load
have been calculated and found to be well below the Indian Standards
Institution's proposed requirements, which are more stringent than
requirements in the USA. Instruments will be installed to monitor and record
stack enissions continuously.  A monitoring network will go into operation
with Unit 5, consisting of five stations at ground level placed in the
vicinity of the Trombay power station.
3.19    The condenser cooling water is drawn from Bombay harbour and its
temperature raised by IloC (200F) before being returned. Model studies have
been performed by the Central Water and Power Research Institute, who
concluded that the rise in the temperature of the sea would be negligible and
there would be no adverse effect on marine life. Waste effluent from the
demineralisers will be aerated and neutralised to bring its pH within the
State Water Pollution Board's specified limits before being discharged into
the sea. Domestic effluents will be collected in septic tanks and
transferred to settling tanks. After aeration the residues will be used as
fertiliser. Ash from the boilers will be used for land reclamation. The



-25-
plant and equipment will be designed to ensure a noise level less than 90
decibels, which is well below the accepted maximum level for shift workers on
a normal eight-hour day.
Completion Report
3.20    Within six months of the closing date of the loan, TEC will furnish
to the Bank a project completion report on its cost, execution, initial
operating experience, the performance of the Borrower and the Bank of their
obligations under the Loan Agreement and the accomplishment of the purposes
of the loan.
Risks
3.21    There appear to be no risks with this project except the usual ones
associated with developments of this nature.

IV. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
4.01    The three Tata Electric Companies (TEC) together would be the
borrower of the proposed Bank loan. As a result, the ensuing financial
analysis is based on the consolidated financial statements of the three
Companies for the periods 1978/79 through 1982/83 (actual) and 1983/84
through 1990/91 (forecast). The actual and projected financial statements,
together with the underlying assumptions, are presented in Annexes 10 to 15.
4.02    The earnings of the Companies are regulated by the Sixth Schedule
of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948 (the Act). This schedule provides,
inter alia, that licensees shall so adjust their charges for the sale of
electricity, whether by enhancing or reducing them, that their "clear profit
in any year shall not, as far as possible, exceed their amount of reasonable
return." "Clear profit" represents the entity's income (from the sale of
energy, rentals and other utility receipts), less its admissible expenses
(including operating expenses, interest on money borrowed, income tax,
certain appropriations to statutory reserves, and other special
appropriations permitted by the State Government). The admissible expenses,
together with a margin for clear profit, form the basis for determining the
average sale price of power. "The amount of reasonable return" is defined as
the sum of:
(a) 7% of that part of the capital base equal to the capital
base as of March 31, 1965;
(b) a percentage on the balance of the capital base equal to
2% over the Reserve Bank rate prevailing at the beginning
of the year (currently the Reserve Bank rate is 10%); and
(c) additional sums equal to 0.5% on capital borrowed (i) from
institutions approved by the State Government and (ii) by
the issue of debentures.
In the event that the Companies' "clear profit" would exceed the amount of
reasonable return for the year, provision is made in the Act for its
disposal. The actual statements of "clear profit" and "reasonable return"
for 1978/79 through 1982/83, together with projections for the period 1983/84
to 1990/91 are shown in Annexes 14 and 15.
4.03    If an electricity supply licensee such as TEC realises the surpluses
permissible under the Act, its financial performance should be acceptable to



-27-
the Bank. During the last five years (Table 4.1), TEC's financial
performance has exceeded that of all other organizations in the sector
benefitting from Bank Group financing.
4.04    TEC is an unusual electricity supply undertaking in that it serves
only 114 industrial consumers in addition to two licensees, the Indian
Railways and the Regional Grid (through the facilities of MSEB). All of TEC
customers are concentrated in a small geographical area and take high voltage
supply. Thus, TEC is not required to invest heavily in transmission and
distribution equipment. With minor exceptions, all customers have the
ability to pay for properly priced electricity and can pay their bills on
time. TEC maintains a single simple tariff structure. Its price for
electricity is the maximum allowable under the Act and it bills and collects
from its consumers monthly without problems. Thus, a financial analysis of
TEC does not focus on revenues and commercial activities, as would be normal
procedure in evaluating a public utility; rather, it would emphasize cost
control and profitability, and be useful primarily for assessing the
efficiency with which TEC runs its power plants.
TEC-s Tariff
4.05    TEC derives its principal revenues from sales to its industrial
consumers. It also sells power to two licensees and to MSEB (however, TEC
derives no revenues from MSEB since it buys more power than it sells and
settlements are on a net basis). Charges to the two licensees differ
slightly from TEC's industrial tariff (Annex 9), a breakdown of which is
itemized below:
(a) A Demand Charge, expressed in Rs/kVA, which is determined by
the consumer s peak sanctioned demand and his power factor.
Since 1978/79, the Demand Charge has increased from about
Rs 20.30/kVA to about Rs 27.00/kVA, representing an aggre-
gate escalation of about 33% or an annual rate of about
4.9%;
(b) A Basic Energy Charge, expressed in paise/kWh, which is
directly proportional to consumption. Since 1978/79, the
Basic Energy Charge has increased from 10.55 paise/kWh
to about 20.80 paise/kWh, representing an aggregate
escalation of 97% or annual rate of 12.0%;
(c) A Fuel Adjustment Charge, expressed in paise/kWh, which
is directly proportional to consumption. Since 1979, the
Fuel Adjustment Charge has increased from 9.0 paise/kWh
to 27.51 paise/kWh, representing an aggregate escalation
of about 206% or an annual rate of 20.5%; and



-28-
(d) An Excise Duty, expressed in paise/kWh, which is directly
proportional to consumption.  This Excise Duty has been 2.12
paise/kWh since well before 1978/79.
TEC can raise the Demand Charge and the Basic Energy Charge only once per
year and has usually done so after MSEB has increased the basic tariff for
power which TEC purchases from the grid. TEC can raise the Fuel Adjustment
Charge monthly; and the substantial escalation in this surcharge reflects the
rate at which fuel costs have increased in India during the past four years.
TEC merely collects the Excise Duty and passes iit on to GOM, never mixing
these funds with its own operational cash flows.,
Cost Control and Profitability
4.06    During the past five years, TEC has consistently realized the
surpluses permissible under the Act. The three Companies have paid dividend
on all share capital for many years. Table 4.1 shows TEC's principal
financial results for the period 1978/79 to 1983/84.1/

4.07    The increases in TEC's tariff and cost structures have resulted
primarily from increases in fuel costs of about 172.5% in the aggregate
(about 22.2% per year) and increases in the cost of power purchases from MSEB
(Annex 16) of about 63.7% in the aggregate (about 10.4% per year). Most
other costs have escalated at less than the intervening rate of inflation.
The growth in levels of net operating income between 1979/80 and 1980/81
reflect sizeable increases in TEC's capital base and, therefore, allowed
1/ Estimates presented for the year ended March 31, 1984, are based on the
results of ten months actual operations and estimates made in April 1984
for results of the last two months. At that time, the transactions made
during February and March 1984 were generally known and most were
recorded in the Companies books; however, some of the supporting documen-
tation needed to complete the accounting remained outstanding.



-29-
"reasonable return." The drop in net operating income in 1982/83 results from
TEC-s election to make deeper contributions to statutory reserves than in
previous years. TEC-s ability to realize admissible surpluses and pay its
dividends during the 1978/79 to 1983/84 period attests to TEC's forecasting
and cost control ability.
Liquidity
4.08    As Table 4.1 demonstrates, TEC-s biggest problem since 1979 has been
maintaining sufficient liquidity to conduct its operations. This cash
constraint was caused in part by increasing needs for working capital (see
paras 4.23-4.24); more importantly, TEC had to meet the cash flow
requirements for implementing the Third Trombay Thermal Power Project in
advance of realising reimbursement or refinancing of those costs. In fact,
TEC met these cash flow constraints by taking steps to enhance revenues prior
to receiving COM approvals (paras 4.11-4.12). Only recently, GOM gave its
formal approval to TEC's use of these measures; had GOM denied or continued
withholding approval of these measures, the Companies- (joint and several)
financial health would have been placed in serious jeopardy. Under such
conditions, it could not have supported the proposed project.
The Third Trombay Thermal Power Project - Project Finance
4.09    When the Bank agreed to make a US$105 million loan to implement the
Third Trombay Project, TEC and GOI gave an understanding in the preamble to
the loan agreement that GOM would contribute to the project an amount equal
to the difference between Rs 172 million and any security deposits which TEC
might collect from its consumers. Under the Act, TEC had the right to
collect from each consumer a security deposit amounting to as much as three
months' billings, or an aggregate of about Rs 150 million. As TEC was
collecting these amounts, several consumers brought suit against a different
utility in the Bombay area, contending that because of their long histories
of paying their bills promptly, the posting of security was both unnecessary
and onerous. The Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs and, in a separate
action, enjoined TEC from collecting any more security deposits from its
consumers; however, it did not require that TEC refund the Rs 51 million
already collected from other consumers.
4.10    As a result, in accordance with the aforementioned preamble to Loan
1549-IN, GOM has the responsibility to finance the Rs 121 million which
remain uncollected from the Rs 172 million commitment. Because of revenue
enhancement measures which TEC adopted in September 1981, GOM has indicated
that a contribution of Rs 73 million would satisfy its obligation in the
financing for the Third Trombay Thermal Power Project. An amount of Rs 73
million was included in GOM-s FY83 budget; on March 31, 1983, TEC received a
partial payment of Rs 40 million together with GOM's assurance that the
remaining Rs 33 million had been budgeted and would be paid during 1983/84.
TEC did not receive this payment during 1983/84; however, it did receive



-30-
assurances that the payment would be forthcoming in 1984/85. TEC has tacitly
agreed to this settlement, which is acceptable given that GOM has now
formally authorized TEC's revenue enhancement measures (paras 4.11-4.12).
4.11    In the course of implementing the Third Trombay Thermal Power
Project, TEC also encountered heavy cost overruns of about Rs 517.4 million
(about 28.7% of the original estimate of Rs 1800 million). These cost
overruns resulted from unexpected increases in the costs of civil works and
customs duties and from adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. To
meet these additional costs, TEC succeeded in raising an additional Rs 266.4
million in loans from local financial institutions; Rs 39.1 million in Fixed
Deposit Loans from shareholders and the public at large (para 4.23); and
Rs 16.6 million from traditional sources of internal cash generation. To
cover the remaining gap, and also to ease the constraints caused by its
inability to collect the aforementioned Rs 121 million, TEC created and began
contributing 2 paise/kWh on all power sold to a Special Appropriation for
Project Costs. TEC assumed GOM would rule favorably regarding the
admissibility of allocations to this Special Appropriation in the computation
of "clear profit"; as a result, TEC has included this allocation in deriving
its basic tariff ever since September 1981. GOM has only recently issued a
favorable ruling regarding the admissibility of past contributions to this
Special Appropriation for Project Costs.
4.12    Through 1983/84, TEC contributed Rs 267.7 million to this Special
Appropriation to Project Costs. This contribution was intended to cover the
remaining gap of Rs 195.3 million in the financing of the Third Trombay
Thermal Power Project (Loan 1549-IN) together with the Rs 48 million
differential between GOM's obligation to finance Rs 121 million and its
agreement to meet only Rs 73 million of that project's cost (para 4.10).
Although GOM has still not met the promised remaining Rs 33 million, TEC has
raised Rs 24.4 million more than intended through the Special Appropriation
for Project Costs and the remaining Rs 8.6 million by deferring some other
minor capital improvements. Thus, the Third Trombay Thermal Power Project
has now been completely financed, although some disbursements from
Loan 1549-IN and from committed local loans will only be made in
August-October 1984 (retention payments are due only after completion of
performance tests on Unit 5).
Financing Plan 1984/85-1989/90
4.13    TEC's detailed projected cash flow for the period 1983/84 to 1990/91
is presented in Annex 12. Table 4.2 summarises TEC's Financing Plan for the
period of expenditures on the proposed project, 1984/85-1989/90.

4.14    TEC is planning to contribute Rs 875.0 million in internally
generated cash to finance 21% of its investment program for this period.
Because TEC has chosen to pay interest on loans for the proposed project as
and when incurred, interest during construction is being treated as an
operating expenditure and not as a capital cost. TEC plans to meet that
interest during construction from internal cash generation. If this
interest, which amounts to Rs 888.6 million during the 1984/85 to 1989/90
period (the actual period of borrowing for the proposed project), is added to
the capital cost shown in Table 4.2, TEC plans to cover Rs 1763.6 million,
representing 35% of its 1984/85 to 1989/90 (the period of expenditure on the
proposed project) investment program, from internal cash generation.
4.15    In order to meet this target, TEC will have to continue making
contributions to the Special Appropriation for Project Cost. GOM has agreed,
for the purpose of enabling cash generation to finance the Fourth Trombay
Project, to accept TEC contributions to the Special Appropriation for Project
Cost as admissible expenses in the computation of "clear profit," beginning
April 1, 1984 and lasting through the completion of the proposed project.
Also, TEC-s confirmed that it will contribute not less than 3 paise/kWh to
this Special Appropriation for Project Costs, with effect from April 1, 1984
and lasting until completion of the proposed project.



-32-
4.16    To finance the proposed project, TEC will seek to raise loans of
about Rs 972 million (US$90 million) from a consortium of local financial
institutions. This consortium, led by the Industrial Credit and Investment
Corporation of India Limited, have agreed to provide a total of about Rs 1040
million toward the financing of the proposed project (the entire amount need
not be transacted).
4.17    Numerous private and public sector sources of funds from developed
countries have expressed a substantive interest in participating in financing
the proposed project.  As a result, an amount of about US$55 million
(Rs 594.0 million) from TEC-s financing plan for the proposed project (the
period 1984/85 to 1989/90) has been allocated for participation by an
"unspecified External Financing." Arrangements for this element of the
project-s financing plan would depend, inter alia, on the timing of
procurement, the source of equipment and the terms and conditions of
financing available. TEC will obtain the necessary external financing during
the implementation of the Project and will advise the Bank of its progress in
doing so.
4.18     A proposed Bank loan of US$135.4 million (Rs 1462.0 million) is
expected to finance 35% of TEC-s 1984/85 to 1989/90 investment program. The
proposed Bank loan will have a maturity of 20 years. During the first five
years, TEC will make interest payments semi-annually. At the conclusion of
the five years grace period on repayment of principal, TEC will make equal
semi-annual payments of principal while paying interest on the declining
balance of the loan.  Interest on the Bank loan will be payable in accordance
with the Bank-s standard terms and conditions. TEC will be responsible for
bearing the foreign exchange risk associated with the Bank loan. As
guarantor of the loan, GOI would charge TEC a guarantee fee of 2.75% per
annum. I/ In addition, TEC will be responsible for paying a front end fee of
0.25% on the amount it borrows from the Bank and, during the period of
project implementation, a 0.75% commitment fee on all undisbursed amounts.
4.19    During implementation of the Third Trombay Thermal Power Project,
TEC ran into problems as a result of heavy cost overruns. Although the
Companies were especially careful in developing the cost estimates for the
proposed project and do not expect a recurrence of the problem, the
possibility of such a recurrence could not be ignored. At appraisal, TEC
confirmed that it would cover possible cost overruns by seeking additional
financing through a combination of (a) raising equity; (b) raising additional
1/  The aggregate rate resulting may appear somewhat lower than the commer-
cial rate of 14% which TEC will incur on the funds it borrows from local
financial institutions; however, TEC will assume the foreign exchange
risk for the proposed World Bank loan, a risk which over 20 years should
offset the differential.



-33-
borrowings from local financial institutions; and (c) generating additional
cash from operations. Specific proposals for meeting such an eventuality
would be furnished to the Bank as and when appropriate.
Future Finance
4.20    With the assumed additional power generation resulting from
completion of both the Third Trombay Thermal Power Project in March 1984 and
the proposed project in 1989/90, TEC should continue realising a "clear
profit" equal to its "reasonable return"; it should also continue meeting
its dividend regularly.
4.21    During the period 1983/84 to 1990/91, TEC's average price per kWh
is projected to increase by an aggregate of 55%, or 6.5% per year (Annex 14).
An analysis of TEC's projected revenues shows that it will need to adjust its
Demand and Basic Energy Charges only nominally between now and 1990/91. The
Fuel Adjustment Charge, however, is now projected to increase at an aggregate
rate of 113.6%, or 11.4% per year, accounting for most of TECs price
increases. These expectations are based on the assumption that the cost of
fuel will rise in accordance with inflation. TEC disagrees with this
assumption, believing instead that (a) current trends indicate lower world
market prices for basic fuels; and (b) although fuel prices are controlled in
India, they ultimately follow trends prevailing in world markets. If TEC-s
analysis is correct, fuel costs might increase by less than the general rate
of inflation and correspondingly, TEC's price of electricity need not
increase as dramatically as projected.
4.22    The projections indicate that TEC is likely to encounter liquidity
constraints after completion of the proposed project, namely 1989/90, 1990/91
and beyond. These liquidity problems result from several provisions of the
Act which limit a licensee-s ability to generate cash as its business
expands. At negotiations, while reminding the Bank that the Act could only
be amended by the Legislative Branch of Government, GOI gave an undertaking
that it would be willing to discuss those suggestions for adjustments to the
Act (paras 4.23-4.27), as are consistent with GOI's policies in the sector,
with future Bank missions.
4.23    In response to both inflation and increased business, TEC will need
to expand its working capital substantially between now and 1990/91. In
recent years it has raised fixed deposits from both shareholders and the
public at large. These fixed deposits, which at one time represented low
interest working capital borrowings, are considered by the Act as part of the
capital base for "reasonable return" computations; consequently, the interest
payable is not considered an admissible expense in deriving a "clear profit."
Today, TEC has been paying interest of 15% on these fixed deposits while
realising a "reasonable return" of 12% on the principal; consequently, it has
had to bear the burden of the 3% differential. GOM has recently agreed that
it will consider the differential between the interest rate payable on fixed



-34-
deposits and the amount of "reasonable return" allowable on the principal of
those fixed deposits to be an admissible expense in the "clear profit"
computation. At negotiations, GOI gave an undertaking that it would discuss
with future Bank missions, an adjustment to the! Act which would withdraw the
principal of these fixed deposits from a licensee-s capital base and permit
the interest on those fixed deposits to be treaLted in its entirety as an
admissible expense in deriving "clear profit."
4.24    In 1990/91 TEC projects carrying accounts receivable nearly double
the amount that it carried in 1981/82, even though it still assumes efficient
billings and collections (since TEC issues bills after it has sold the
electricity, it will always show one month's accounts receivables even if all
customers are current). In computing a licensee-s allowable "reasonable
return," the Act permits including net working capital less accounts
receivable in its capital base. CEA explained that this provision was framed
because electricity supply licensees have the right to collect three months'
security deposits from their consumers, thereby raising the cash necessary to
support a reasonable level of accounts receivable. In view of the Court's
adverse ruling prohibiting TEC from collecting the security deposits, GOI
gave an undertaking at negotiations that it would discuss with future Bank
missions an adjustment to the Act which would allow an electricity supply
licensee to include at least one month-s accounts receivables in its capital
base in circumstances where it is legally barresd from collecting the security
deposits to which it is entitled.
4.25    Under the Act, a licensee is required to depreciate its assets on a
straight line basis. Under the tax code, the same licensee is required to
depreciate its assets on an accelerated basis. Consequently, during the
first ten to twenty years of the life of generating stations and other major
assets, the book value of assets as computed for tax purposes and for
regulatory purposes differs substantially. Holwever, under both rules, the
licensee is required to show as its tax liability the amount actually paid.
Should the licensee be forced into liquidation, the differential in book
value is considered as a previously untaxed gain to the shareholders and is
subject to a heavy deferred tax. In fact, TEC's shareholders risk losing a
substantial amount of their equity at the termination of TEC's license as a
result of this deferred tax liability. At negotiations, GOI gave an
undertaking that it would discuss with future Bank missions an adjustment to
the Act that would reconcile the treatment of a licensee-s depreciation as
computed for regulatory purposes and for tax purposes.
4.26    Under the Act, interest payment on all loans (other than Fixed
Deposits-para 4.23) are admissible expenses in deriving "clear profit";
however, principal repayments are not admissible. The Act assumes that a
licensee s aggregate loan repayments will not exceed its depreciation in any
given year. Beginning in 1984/85, TEC's principal repayments will exceed its
depreciation and it will need to make use of a Special Appropriation for Debt
Redemption, not specifically authorised under the Act but included in the



-35-
agreements for Loan 1549-IN. At negotiations, TEC agreed, as it did under
Loan 1549-IN, that it will include provision for such Special Appropriation
as may be necessary to meet the cash shortfall in debt redemption for the
purpose of determining its tariff under the Sixth Schedule of the Act.
4.27    Through 1989/90, TEC projects comfortable levels of debt service
coverage of at least 1.5; thereafter, debt service coverage falls to the
range of about 1.2 to 1.3. Although this level is still satisfactory, its
realisation is based on the assumption that TEC will charge for its
electricity the maximum price allowable in accordance with the Sixth Schedule
of the Act.
Debt Control
4.28    The Companies Act of 1956 (Section 293) provides that the Board of
Directors of a public company shall not, except with the consent of such
company in general meetings, borrow money where the money to be borrowed
together with the money already borrowed, would exceed its paid-up capital
and "free reserves" (those reserves not set apart for any specific purpose).
TEC has notified the Bank that, at their last annual meeting in September
1983, the Directors of each of three Companies passed a resolution raising
its debt ceiling in accordance with Table 4.3. Because each of the three
Companies must take joint and several responsibility for both joint
borrowings and the foreign exchange component of its IBRD loans and other
foreign borrowings, each Company needed to approve two separate debt
ceilings, one denominated in rupees and the second in US dollars. At
negotiations, TEC agreed to consult the Bank prior to making any new increase
in the debt ceiling of any of its constituent companies, which would have
the effect of raising the aggregate ceiling for all three Companies beyond
Rs 9190 million and US$990 million.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Demand for the Project
5.01      A 500 MW sixth unit at Trombay will be immediately fully utilized
serving TEC's own consumers. When the unit is commissioned TEC's will import
less energy and power from MSEB. However, capacity on the MSEB system will
remain fully utilized as both this system and the Western Region as a whole
will continue to suffer from a substantial shortage of power.
Least Cost Development
5.02      In brief, the Project forms part of the Western Region's least cost
power development plan because:
(a)  CEA-s Long Term Power Plan (LTPP) includes several coal-
fired coastal power stations;
(b)  Trombay has unique advantages as a site for one of these
coal-fired stations; and
(c)  a unit at Trombay would have the additional advantage, at least
in the short term, of access to fuels with a lower opportunity
cost than domestic coal.
These reasons are discussed in more detail below.
5.03     The LTPP, finalized in 1983, concluded that problems of system
balance, shortage of cooling water, availability of land and pollution
precluded the possibility of meeting demand entirely by constructing
coal-fired power stations near coalfields. Therefore, four large coastal
power stations to burn sea-borne coal were included in the desirable power
development plan. These coastal stations would confer advantages with
respect to system stability, reduced losses and voltage control.
5.04    Trombay represents a particularly attractive site for a coal-fired
coastal power station for the following reasons:
(a)  Trombay is very close to Bombay, the largest load centre in the
Western Region;
(b)  it is an existing power station site, the need for
infrastructure would be minimal, and a new unit can be added
there about two years sooner than on the other coastal sites;
(c)  Trombay's site is located on the water s edge of Bombay harbor;



-38-
(d) the replacement of old sets at the same site makes efficient use
of existing transmission facilities; and
(e) TEC has an excellent record with respect to both power station
construction and operation.
5.05    A unit at Trombay has an additional advantage over a coal-fired unit
elsewhere because it is ideally placed to use associated gas and secondary
cracked residual oil both of which, at least in the short term, are expected
to have an opportunity cost less than that of domestic coal.
5.06    Associated gas which would otherwise be flared will be available
during the early years of the project's life. In the longer term fertilizer
factories promise to provide a higher value use for this gas but factories
planned to date will not be commissioned until some years after the proposed
project is completed. In addition, the accelerated development of the Bombay
High oilfield is leading to expectations of much more associated gas than had
been planned for, so the surplus of associated gas could well last for more
than five years of the Project's life. While GOI did not reveal any existing
plans for the exploitation of free gas substantial recent discoveries may
lead to the conclusion that this too has a low opportunity cost. However, a
firm conclusion on this will only be possible after further exploration and
planning of natural gas use.
5.07    Both of the refineries in Bombay will shortly be equipped with
secondary crackers and the residual oil produced after secondary cracking is
expected to be a very difficult product to handle. With a pour point in
excess of 500C this residual will be quite solid at ambient temperatures.
There is presently no market for such a product in India (except in Trombay's
existing sets). In the next few years, if efforts were made to develop a
market, it is reasonable to assume that this fuel would substitute for
domestic coal.  It is unlikely that any export market would realize a higher
fob price than this and so the opportunity cost of using this fuel at Trombay
would be based on parity with delivered domestic coal. After allowance is
made for delivery to other customers the ex-refinery value, appropriate to
Trombay, would be a little less than domestic coal parity. In the long term
it is possible that developments in either refinery technology or other
markets may lead to higher value uses for this product, causing GOI to divert
this fuel away from Trombay and to increase deliveries of domestic coal to be
burned in its place.
5.08    The availability of low cost associated gas and secondary residual
oil in the early years of the Project's life justifies the triple firing
capability of this plant. As there will initially be sufficient low cost gas
and oil it is preferable to delay installation of facilities, such as mills,
that are required solely to burn coal. These facilities need only be ordered



-39-
when the changeover to coal is foreseen within the lead time required for
their installation. However, as TEC cannot reasonably estimate how long gas
and oil will be available at low cost, they have prudently chosen to design
the station in a manner which facilitates conversion to coal firing. In
particular the larger boiler required to burn coal should be included within
the proposed project as this will be very much cheaper than complete
reboilering after, say, five years of the plant's life if conversion to coal
were to happen at that time.
Rate of Return
5.09    The Project can be considered in isolation, i.e., as serving only
TEC-s system, or as an addition to capacity in the Western Region as a whole.
Treating the Project as an addition solely to the TEC system and estimating
benefits on the basis of TEC-s tariff yields an economic rate of return of
23.5%. However, treating the Project as a part of the Western Region as a
whole, with the concomitant decrease in the average tariff, increase in
associated transmission and distribution expenditure and increase in system
losses, reduces the economic rate of return to 9.4%. This return, however,
is not a reflection of the economic merit of the Project per se--the present
degree of load shedding is evidence that consumers are willing to pay
substantially more for electricity than the present tariffs would suggest.
If an allowance is made, for example, for industrial consumers' willingness
to pay by assuming that they value electricity at the average of the existing
industrial tariff and the cost of autogeneration, the economic rate of return
increases to 13.2%. Detailed assumptions underlying this economic analysis
are described in Annex 16.
5.10    TEC merits the Bank's continued support.  It was India's first
electric utility, and throughout its history has served as a leading
technical innovator in the power sector.  It built the country's first
gas-fired steam station, its first 150 MW unit and its first 500 MW unit,
and is contemplating its first supercritical pressure unit. TEC led the way
in introducing computerized load dispatching, and its training facilities
include the first computer simulators of 150 MW and 500 MW power plants. As
well as performing its role in technical innovation, TEC has demonstrated to
the sector unusually high standards of general management, project management,
plant operation, plant maintenance and staff training. The Bank has enjoyed
a long and fruitful relationship with TEC, and it is in the interest of the
sector that the Bank should continue to support an efficient private sector
organization that has made the unique contribution and possesses the unusual
attributes of TEC.

FOURTH TROMBAY THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Long-Term Power Plan
(Western Region)
Demand Forecast
1.      The Plan is based on demand forecasts by CEA, using different methods
for different consumer categories. The industrial demand forecast is based
on empirical relationships between growth of e!lectricity consumption and
growth of value added in industry; irrigation pumping forecasts are dependent
on the planned rate of new pump connections, the expected utilization rates,
and the replacement rate of diesel pumps. Residential and commercial use is
extrapolated from past relationships over time. Two scenarios, depending on
assumptions of higher or lower growth of industrial value added, have been
developed. The results of the unconstrained forecast, by Region, are

2.      While the CEA estimate for 1989/90 falls about midway between
previous forecasts, it is on the high side by the year 2000. This is mostly
due to the assumption of high sustained industrial growth in the high
scenario. The average annual growth rates for All-India resulting from this
exercise are high initially (reflecting the growth from present suppressed
demand levels), but taper off to about 7-8% per year by 1995 (Table 2).

3.      The pattern of electricity consumption in various consumer categories
is expected to undergo some change. Consumption in the agricultural sector
would gradually decline from the present 18% to about 13% by the end of the
century, due to saturation of the demand for agricultural pumping. There
would also be a slight decline in the share of industrial consumption, and
an increase in consumption in residential, commercial and other categories.
4.      Assumptions concerning the transformation of consumption forecasts
into energy generation and peak capacity requirements are (i) a reduction in
system losses in the two maj3r Regions from more than 20% to 15-17%, and (ii)
a decline in system load factor as restrictions on supply are gradually
relaxed. For purposes of system expansion planning, CEA used the high
consumption forecast scenario. While this scenario may prove too optimistic
in the later years (high sustained industrial growth, little emphasis on
industrial energy conservation), its effect on generating requirements, and
consequently capacity expansion, may be compensated by failure to bring down
system losses rapidly. The use of the high scenario as basis for the
least-cost expansion plan is therefore the most reasonable choice at this
stage.
Least-Cost Capacity Expansion Plan
5.      The model (WASP, version III) uses the committed generating projects
(under construction or sanctioned by CEA for construction) as fixed input,
and a list of new hydro and thermal projects with their associated capital
and recurrent costs as variable elements, in determining the least-cost
expansion sequence necessary to meet forecast demand. For each of the five
Regions, separate system optimizations were undertaken. Each optimization
was subjected to sensitivity tests with respect to
(i) constraints on the optimum hydro plant development because of
possible delays;
(ii) the siting of coal-fired plants at pitheads or close to load
centers;



-44-                         ANNEX 2
Page 3 of 11
(iii) the forced outage rate (FOR) of thermal plants; and
(iv) the discount rate.
6.      The main variations affecting the expansion program are those of
hydro construction and forced outage rates. The results show that the "high
hydro" option is usually cheapest (although not always significantly), and
that concentration of thermal power at pitheads would reduce the overall
costs considerably. High forced outage rates increase the cost
significantly. Table 3 summarizes the expansion scenarios for each major
Region, subject to a maximum desirable loss of load probability (LOLP) of 1%,
together with the least-cost transmission options for each generation option.
7.      In general, the high hydro/low FOR option turns out to be the
least-cost expansion solution for all Regions. This option is examined with
respect to expected future constraints on funds in the ongoing Sixth and
forthcoming Seventh Plans. If no additional funds can be mobilized in these
two Plans, some capacity additions have to be postponed to the Eighth Plan,
resulting in higher LOLP and lower peak reserve margins. Table 4 illustrates
the effect on reserve margins of a delay in capacity expansion. Table 5
summarizes the final CEA judgement on desirable expansion programs in each
Region, taking into account fund constraints, qualitative features, and
possible difficulties in bringing down FOR. The program aims at reaching
LOLP of about 1% by the early 1990s.
8.      The desirable expansion program for the Western Region includes load
center coastal burning stations at Bhavnagar (2x500 MW), Navsari (2x500 MW),
Dabhol (5x210 MW) and Nava Sheva (3x500 MW). The greater cost of load center
generation is mitigated by system balance considerations; the need to satisfy
increasing demand more rapidly than the normal design and construction period
for new hydro generating facilities; and by the greater assurance that these
stations can receive fuel by sea in the event of constraints either on the
internal supply or the inland transport of coal. Because of its advanced
level of preparation and because expansion of an existing site is expected to
shorten construction time considerably, CEA considers that the 500 MW unit
proposed as the Fourth Trombay project can be treated as one of the units in
coastal stations.

/a  The above programme assumes that a capacity of 19866 MW would be added
during the Sixth Plan.
lb  The inputs for the long-term planning study were finalized in August
1981. At that time, it was envisaged that a capacity of 4662 MW would
be commissioned during 1982-83. According to present indications, it
is expected that during 1982-83 a capacity of 3717 MW (including
Nuclear) would be commissioned and erection in respect of 945 MW would
be completed.                                                                                                                                                           C

FOURTH TROMBAY THERMAL POWER PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Steam Generator
1.      The steam generator will be an outdoor, balanced draft, single drum,
reheat unit equipped for firing coal, oil and gas separately or in
combination, rated to produce about 1670 tons (3.67 million pounds) per hour
of steam at 178 atg and 5410C (2615 psig and 101060F). The air and flue gas
system will comprise forced draft fans, gas recirculation fans, steam coil
air preheaters, regenerative air preheaters and induced draught fans. There
will be provision for an electrostatic precipitator having four parallel
streams which can be shut down one at a time for maintenance. The stack will
be 152.4 m (500 ft) high, and provision will be made for installation of flue
gas scrubbers in the future.
Turbo Generator Set
2.      The turbine will be a 3 cylinder, single reheat, condensing, tandem
compound machine, with a double exhaust having last stage blades 1080 mm
(42.5 ins) long. It will be designed to permit either constant pressure or
variable pressure operation, and will be rated to deliver 500 MW at the
generator terminals with a throttle steam flow of 1607.86 tons/hour (3.537
million lbs/hr) at 169.0 atg (2480 psig) and 5380/5380C (l000/1000F).
Condensate from the condenser hotwell will be pumped through a gland steam
condenser and three low pressure heaters into a deaerator. From the
deaerator it will be taken by the boiler feed pumnps and pumped through two
high pressure heaters back to the steam generator. Two turbine-driven boiler
feed pumps will be provided and there will be one motor-driven one for
start-up and standby.
3.      The generator will be two pole, rated at 588 MVA, 21 kV, 3 phase, 50
Hz, 3000 rpm.  The stator winding, phase connectors and bushings will be
water cooled, while the rotor winding will be hydrogen cooled. Excitation
will be brushless using rotating diodes.
Circulating Water
4.      For the intake structure and pumphouse another caisson will be placed
beside that for Unit 5. The pumphouse will contain four C.W. pumps of 25%
capacity each, coarse screens, travelling screens, wash pumps, seal pumps,

Page 2 of 3
transformer and switchgear. Circulating water will be carried from the
pumphouse by a single mild steel cement-lined steel pipe of 3.3 m (10.9 ft)
internal diameter. When approaching the condenser through the switchyard and
plant area a concrete tunnel of the same diameter will be employed. Hot
water leaving the condenser will pass through a similar tunnel to a sealing
well, from where it will enter the discharge channel and return to the
harbour.
Main Building and Foundations
5.      The turbine hall of Unit 5 will be extended to accommodate Unit 5.
The extension will be a reinforced concrete building 82 m long x 35 m wide by
40 m high. The existing 120t/30t overload travelling crane will also serve
Unit 6. Foundations for all major structural components will be supported on
piles. The foundations for the boiler and chimney will be on rafts supported
on piles.
Fuel Oil Storage
6.      For Unit 6 there will be added two 8,100 ton tanks for LSHS and one
4,050 ton tank for blended oil, bringing the total fuel oil storage on site
to 53,500 tons. This corresponds to two weeks' supply with both 500 MW units
burning oil only at a plant utilisation factor of 68%. No additional
capacity for ignition and start up oil is necessary for Unit 6.
Switchyard
7.      Unit 6 will be provided with three 200 MVA single phase generator
transformers to step up from the generator voltage of 21 kV to 220 kV. Unit
5's spare single phase transformer will serve also as a spare for Unit 6.
The existing Unit 5 switchyard will be extended by the addition of five 220
kV bays, one for generator no. 6, two for 220 kV feeders, one for the station
transformer and one spare.
8.      A 220 kV transmission line from Trombay to South Bombay will be built
and connected to TEC's 110 kV system.
Instruments and Controls
9.      The unit will be fully automated, instrumented and equipped for
remote operation. It will be controlled by computers located in a central
control room shared with Unit 5.

10,     Systems to be provided include fuel oiL, ignition oil, water
treatment plant, raw water, demineralized water, auxiliary steam, service
air, turbogenerator lubricating oil and station fire protection. Many of
these will be interconnected with those for UnLt 5.
Miscellaneous Electrical
11.     Systems include 21 kV/6.9 kV Unit Auxi:Liary Transformers; 6.6 kV/433
V station service transformers; 6.6 kV and 433 V switchgear; DC supplies for
main plant, switchyard, and instruments and controls; voice communication;
normal and emergency lighting; and grounding.

Assumptions Used for Financial Statements
1.      The statements in this report present forecasts of TEC's financial
operations for the period 1983/84 through 1990/91. They include income
statements, incorporating forecasts of the generation and sales of energy
(Annex 11), sources and application of funds (Annex 12), balance sheets
(Annex 13), estimated clear profit statement with calculation of the forecast
average energy prices each year (Annex 14), and details of the capital base,
and the calculation of the annual amounts of reasonable return (Annex 15).
2.      The following assumptions have been used:
Income Statements (Annex 11)
(a)  Energy output from 500 MW generating unit would reach full
commercial operation when operating at 6,000 hours a year (load
factor = 68%);
(b)  TEC are entitled to adjust their basic tariffs annually to
achieve a "clear profit" equal to the annual "amount of
reasonable return". Upward revision in basic tariff is required
in certain years on account of cost: escalations provided for as
mentioned in para 4.05. The forecast average prices, inclusive
of fuel adjustment, are shown in Annex 8.
Fuel Cost
(c)  The cost of fuel is based on 1982 fuel prices given below,
further escalated on the basis of price contingencies estimated
by the Bank in February 1983:
Coal              :   Rs   96/MKCal
Fuel Oil (LSHS)  :   Rs  244/MKCal
Associated Gas   :   Rs   66/MKCal for first 2076354 MKCal/
annum and Rs 235/MKCal for any
additional quantity.
TEC operates a fuel adjustment clause which permits price adjustment
by means of a surcharge to meet variation in fuel costs.



-67-                       ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 3
Other Operating Costs
(d) From 1983/84 onwards operating costs (except insurance) are
escalated on the basis of price contingencies estimated by
the Bank in February 1984. Insurance charges are computed
separately at 0.25% of original costs to cover fire and
allied risks and at 0.75% of the original costs of plant
and machinery towards machinery breakdown risk.
Depreciation
(e) Depreciation on existing plant is provided in accordance
with the Sixth Schedule to the Electricity (Supply) Act
1948, using the straight line method of depreciation.
For computing the annual depreciation charge, 90% of the
original cost of the asset (assuming the salvage value of
10%) is divided by the "prescribed period" which is the
assumed life of an asset as specified in the Central
Government Notifications. Depreciation on a particular
asset is brought into account as an operating expense
only from the beginning of the year of account next
following that in which that asset became available for
use in the business.
The annual accruals of depreciation on plant expressed as a
percentage of original cost are as follows:
Composite Depreciation
Depreciable Plant                        on Original Cost (100%)
Hydro-Electric Plant (3 Stations) )
Trombay Thermal Unit 1, 2, 3 & 4    )               2.7
Trombay Housing Colony                )
Transmission etc.                     )
Trombay Unit 5 & Unit 6 (Assumed)
Interest on Debt
(f) i) Interest for Bank loan has been computed at a composite
rate of 12.5% plus commitment charges at 0.75% per annum.
Front-end fee at 0.25% of the loan amount has been reckoned
in FY1984.



-68-                        ANNEX 10
Page 3 of 3
ii) Since the unspecified co-lender has still to be determined,
the same conditions as for the Bank loan have been used.
iii) Interest on local loans at 14% per annum, plus commitment
charges at 1% per annum on undrawn balances for the first year
and 0.5% per annum thereafter.
iv) Interest on loans raised to finance construction would be
met from revenues (Section XVII (2)(b) (IVa) of the Sixth
Schedule)
Dividends
(g) Assumes existing rates of dividend would continue to be paid,
i.e. 11% on preference shares, and 15% on Ordinary Shares.
Balance Sheets
3.      Gross fixed assets are recorded at original cost.  During
construction, forecast costs are escalated annually from the 1981 prices at
the rates given in para 4.07.
Debtors (Consumers)
4.      Forecast debtors (consumers) at the end of each year are assumed at
approximately one month's billing.
Inventories
5.      Forecasts are made on the basis of the qtantities of fuel oil, coal
and materials which should be held in stock at the end of each year.

FOURTH TROMBAY THERMAL POWER PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.      This Annex sets out the assumptions underlying the calculation of the
Fourth Trombay Thermal Power Project's economic rate of return. The proposed
project can be treated in one of two ways: (i) part of TEC's system in
isolation or, (ii) an integral part of the Western Region. The cost assump-
tions are common to both. The alternative treatments relate primarily to
benefits and are described at the end of this Annex.
Costs
Shadow Prices
2.      Standard conversion factor (SCF) = 0.8
Ratio of shadow wage to financial wage, unskilled labor (urban) = 0.7
Capital Costs
3.       A breakdown of the proposed project's financial capital costs
together with economic costs derived from application of the shadow prices
noted above is given in Table 1.

Operating Costs
Fuel
4.      The plant is assumed to burn associated gas and residual oil for the
first five years of its life Thereafter the plant burns coal plus 20%
residual oil for flame stabilization. During the first five years the
availability of associated gas for Trombay is assumed to remain at its
present level of 300,000 tons per annum. A schedule describing fuel use is
given in Table 2.

5.      The Long Run Marginal Cost of coal has been estimated at Rs 197/ton
at the minemouth (Dudhichua Coal Project, Ln 2393-IN). An estimated economic
transport cost of Rs 224/ton implies that the economic cost of coal delivered
to Trombay is Rs 421/ton.
6.      Although there is presently no market for secondary cracked residual
oil it has been assumed that in the medium term it will be possible to
develop markets in which this fuel substitutes for domestic coal and there-
fore its opportunity cost is based thermal parity with this fuel. Given that
1 ton of coal is equal to 0.422 tons of residual oil, delivered parity would
be Rs 998/ton. After an allowance of Rs 50/ton for delivery the ex-refinery
value of residual oil, appropriate to use at Trombay, is estimated to be
Rs 948/ton.
7.      For the limited period up to 1992/93 associated gas would be flared
if not burned at Trombay, implying that its opportunity cost is very close to
zero. However, unit 5 at Trombay could burn the 300,000 tons pa. which are
assumed to be available. If this fuel is burned on unit 6 it will be neces-
sary to burn domestic coal in its place on unit 5. This, implies that the
opportunity cost of associated gas should be based on thermal parity with
coal and is therefore Rs 1184/ton.  (1 ton of coal   0.422 tons oil equiv-
alent (toe), 1 ton of gas   1.187 toe.)

Other Operating Costs
8.      In financial terms TEC's experience suggests that annual O&M expendi-
ture is very close to 2% of the initial capital value of plant. It has
therefore been assumed that in economic terms O&M costs also amount to 2% of
the initial economic value of the plant. Insurance has been estimated at 1%
of the plant value.
Non-Project Costs
9.      In order to estimate the economic rate of return of a generation
project it is necessary to add an allowance for additional transmission and
distribution expenditure required to achieve sales of the energy generated.
However, 6-7% of the project cost relates to transmission and substation
work.  This proportion appears to be close to the ratio of transmission and
distribution assets to generating assets for TEC as a whole and therefore,
if the project is treated as part of the TEC system in isolation, it is
reasonable to make no further allowance for transmission and distribution
costs. The low proportion of assets in transmission and distribution
reflects the nature of the load served by TEC which consists of a few large
consumers located very close to the power station.
10.     If the project is treated as part of the Western Region as a whole,
the concomitant expenditure on transmission and distribution assets would
be much larger. On average, these have accounted for a sum equivalent to 47%
of expenditure on generating assets. However, the location of Trombay
extremely close to the region's major load center, Bombay, means that
associated incremental transmission and distribution expenditures should be
much less than for the Region as a whole. Associated transmission and dis-
tribution expenditure equal to 60% of the regional average has been assumed.
Benefits
In Relation to TEC System
11.     As there is presently severe rationing of power, TEC's existing
tariff provides a minimum estimate of the value to consumers. In 1983/84
TEC-s average tariff, inclusive of excise tax, was 57.64 paise/kWh. In order
to convert this value of power to border prices it is necessary to apply a
conversion factor. If TEC supplied the full range of domestic and commercial
consumers as well as industrial, the standard conversion factor, 0.8, would
be the most appropriate choice. However, TEC only supplies industrial con-
sumers who, on average, are likely to face prices which are less distorted
than those of the economy as a whole. A conversion factor of 0.9 has there-
fore been assumed. On this basis the value of sales is estimated at 51.9
paise/kWh at border prices.

associated losses and sales are given in Table 3.

1/  Losses comprise approximately 5% station use! and
3% transmission/distribution.
In Relation to Western Region
13.     The average financial tariff in the Western Region is 53.6 paise/kWh.
In economic terms, after applying the SCF of 0.8, this is equivalent to 42.9
paise/kWh. Average losses for the Western region are approximately 18% of
sent out generation. However, the location of Trombay means that incremental
losses associated with generation at this site would be significantly less
than 18%. Therefore, incremental transmission and distribution losses have
been assumed to be 80% of the Regional average. Station use is again assumed
to be 5%.
Results of Rate of Return Analysis
14.     Treated as an element of TEC's system in isolation, the project
yields an economic rate of return of 23.5%. Treated as part of the Western
region, the project's rate of return falls to 9.4%. However, if an allowance
is made for industrial consumers' willingness to pay (see Bodhghat Hydroelec-
tric Project (Ln 2416-IN/Cr SF-20-IN)), the project's rate of return becomes
13.2%.
