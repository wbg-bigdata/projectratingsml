INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPDENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMN DATION OF THE PRESIDE!T TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO MAURITIUS FOR A
RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to MPuritius for the equivalent of US$4.o million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a rural development project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2,          A report entitled "Mauritius - 4-Year Development Plan - An
Assessment" (AE-30a) in three volumes was circulated on November 2, 1972
(R72-240). Country data are provided in Annex I. Annex I also contains a brief
description of the economy as presented in paragraphs 3-14 of my Report and
Recommendations to the Executive Directors on an industrial estate project
(IDA/R73- 78 ) dated June 14, 1973.
PART II - BANY GROUP OPERATIONS
3.          Annex I also contains an amended description of Bank Group operations
in Mauritius, as circulated to the Executive Directors in paragraphs 15-16 of my
Report on the industrial estate project, referred to above (IDA/R73-78). Annex
II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments,
as of April 30, 1973, as iTell as notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
PART III - THE UNENPLOYMENT SITUATION AND THE RURAL SECTOR
Unempl oyment
4.          The failure of the Yauritian economy to provide adequate employment
opportunities lies in its extreme dependence on sugar. Since sugar growing
already uses very labor-intensive methods and the land devoted to sugar
cultivation cannot be significantly expanded, econoymic absorption of additional
workers by the sugar industry is difficult. The labor force (like the area
harvested) in the sugar industry in the early 1970s was barely higher than it
had been ten years earlier when the industry accounted for nearly 40 percent of
employment. The burden of job creation thus fell on the rest of the economy.
In view of the population increase, the failure of the non-sugar sectors to
absorb the increase in the labor force resulted in a critical situation at the
beginning of the 1970s.
5.          Unemployment in Yauritius has increased every year since 1960.   From
about 23,700 persons (12 percent of the labor force) in 1962, unemployment grew
to 41,000 persons (16 percent) in 1972. This large increase has occurred despite
(a) considerable efforts on the part of the Government to provide relief work
for adult males in the public sector, (b) Government encouragement of the sugar
industry to use labor-intensive methods of production, and (c) emigration of
about 900 workers annually.



-2-
C.          Despite this high level of unemployment, some sugar ard tea planters
experienced difficulties in 1972 in securing temporary labor at peak harvest
time partly due to their reluctance to employ some of these persons on a year
round basis. Acceptance of a few months employment disadvantages a worker
because he is placed at the bottom of the unemployment register at the end of
his employment.  In addition, younger workers particularly those with at least six
years of primary schooling are reluctant to take on such temporary and physically
demanding work and this reinforces the long-standing social pressures against
accepting work in the sugar estates. Furthermore, temporary employment in the
tea industry is unattractive, since piece work rates for plucking are low; and
most estates are distant from the center of labor supply. In addition, declining
international tea prices constrain planters from increasing wages.
7.          The Government, as early as 1963, began to take measures to deal with
the unemployment problem.  Initially 1,000 unemployed men were hired in a Relief
Workers program and assigned to various Mlnistries and agencies to carry out
simple maintenance wvork for three days a week.  By 1967, the number of relief
workers had grown to 30,000.   Lack of funds reduced the program to its 1973
size of 12,000. The scheme was not a success as most Ministries were not organized
to manage and control large groups of unskilled workers, and lacked the
capability to design productive labor-intensive projects for these laborers.
Thus, little work was done, the scheme became costly and the workers themselves
became demoralized.
8.          To-provide productive employment instead of relief work, a program
called "Travail pour Tous" (TPT) was organized in 1970.   It, too, was meant to
be a stopgap measure, not to compete with the private sector.   The major
differences between TPT and the Relief Workers Scheme were that in the TPT,9
(1) construction and other new investments replaced maintenance work, and (2)
the workers were centrally managed by a newly created Development Works
Corporation (DATC), rather than dispersed among the M-nistries. From 1971 to
date, D4C has been successful in managing some 6,500 full-time TPT workers (mostly
former relief workers) and in organizing productive work for them,
9.          The Government's s-rategy aims at the creation of permanent employment
in industry, supplemented in the short term by temporary employment opportunities
through works programs.   A satisfactory start has been made in industry, though
the axlibitious 41 percent increase in employment foreseen by the Development
Plan for 1971-75 will probably not be attained. The recent proposal by the
Go-rernment to raise civil serv-ce salaries by an average of 30 percent,
following a 12 percent increase in 1971, is expected to lead to increases in the
private sector.  These increases, however, have to be seen against the background
of stable salaries through the sixties, during wThich the general price level
increased by about 25 percent and as a measure for a more equitable sharing of
recent increases in profits in the sugar industry. The magnitude of the salary
rises should reduce profits and may increase the export prices of manufactured
goods.  The Government is conscious that wvage increases mast be reconciled w7ith
the objective of increasing ep)loyment by attracting new industriesj but the
proposed increase is not expected to reduce substantially Mauritius' competitive
advantage.
The Rural Sector
10.         In Yauritius, land is the limiting factor to expansion of production.
About one-third of the area is mountainous or otherwise unsuited for either



-3-
agricultural or urban development. Of a total area of about 450,000 acres, about
230,000 acres are cultivated, of which 214,000 acres are currently planted to
sugarcane. About 35,000 acres of additional land could be cultivated provided
substantial investments are made in destoning and/or bench terracing. 40 percent
of rural householders are landless, the remaining 60 percent own or rent an
average of 3.5 acres. In the sugar industry, land ownership is skewed, with 53
percent of land owned by 21 large estates. The remaining 47 percent is divided
among an estimated 24,000 owners. About 12,000 acres are under tea, divided
equally betioeen small growers and large estates, and some 5,000 acres are under
food crops in small holdings. Livestock is a small producer activity on a part-
time basis with a low level of. technical efficiency. There are about 58,000
acres of poor quality forest mostly situated in the Central Plateau.
11.        The rural villages of Mauritius are not self-contained commmmities
in the sense of a Euiropean or Asian village.  As they initially grew out of
labor settlements spread along the edges of sugar estates and around the sites of
existing or abandoned sugar mills, they often lack land resources with which
to produce basic food needs and the basic physical amenities of a regular
comnmnity (electricity, adequate water, a market of some kind, internal roads).
They have to rely for many of their needs on the sugar estates.
12.        Income distribution is skewed towards the urban sector and, vithin
agriculture, towards the land-owning agriculturists of which 10 percent own 80
percent of the land. The situation is particularly difficult for the 40 percent
landless rural population, who have annual household incomes at or below
US$250 which is the minimum level necessary for faridly subsistence under
Mauritian conditions.
PART IV  - THE PROJECT
13.        A report entitled "Appraisal of a Rural Development Project -
IBuritius, "No. 161A-I4AS, dated June 5, 1973, is being circulated separately to
the RPecutive Directors.  A credit and project surmary is provided in Annex III
and the project areas are shown in detail in the attached maps (Nos. IBRD 10385
and 10384).
14.        The project was prepared by the Mlnistry of Economic Planning of
Yauritius, assisted by two IDA missions idhich visited the country in November
1971 and June 1972. An IDA appraisal mission was in the field in November 1972
and a follow-up mission in February 1973. Negotiations were held in Washington
at the end of Yay 1973. The &uritian delegation was led by MY. C. Jagatsingh,
Minister of Planning, and included Messrs. R. Pyndiah, Financial Secretary,
Ministry of Finance, 0. Nijhawan, Economic Adviser to the Ministry of Planning,
M. Leal, Chairman of the Board, Development Works Corporation, L.E. Venchard,
Solicitor General, N. Roy, Chief Agriculturist,s Ministry of Agriculture and N.0.
Hawoldar, Senior Village Development Cfficer, Ministry of Planning.
15.        The project covers the next two years (FY1974 and 1975) .of Mauritius'
program of rural development and emiployment creation. While it does not purport
to solve the problem of rural poverty and unemployment in M&uritius, it constitutes
a step in that direction and would be the first case of a Bank Group financed



- 4 -
project for a rural public works program with the creation of productive
employment as its major objective.  Daring its execution, the project would
create temporary employnent for about 7,400 males over 16 years of age and,
after completion, would create about 1,000 permanent job opportunities.  In
addition, the project has been designed to ensure that the benefits of the
investments would accrue to the poorest segments of Mauritius' rural population.
Finally, the project would provide technical assistance to strengthen the
institutions responsible for the preparation and implementation of the program
and to support an extensive training effort.
16.        The Project would consist of the following:
(a)  Raral Village Improvement
Living conditions in Mauritius' poorest villages would
be improved by- the provision of basic amenities such as
public water taps, health centers, simple access and
internal roads, markets and caommnity centers.  Daring the
preparation of the project, a village poverty index has been
constructed tc select the most needy villages.  MJjor elements
in the establishment of this index were: the extent of village
unemployment and underemployment; the availability of village
amenities such as market place, school, clinic, village hall,
water, telephone and electricity supplies; and housing
conditions and transport facilities. Data were obtained for
all village localitiesin Mauritius, based mainly on the 1972
Housing and Population Census returns. Based on this index,
eighty-six villages, grouped into 29 Village Cauncil Areas
(see Yap No. IBRD 10384), have been selected for inclusion
in the village improvement program. Labor-intensive techniaues
would be used to carry out the works required.  It is
estimated that this program would create up to 2X500 temporary
job opportunities during the next two years.
In addition. a village self-help camponent would be
introduced under this program. Assisted by a locally-based
Village Development Cfficer, the people in the villages would
be encouraged to develop schemes (such as fencing of fodder
areas, construction of fishponds, duck and poultry raising),
which would benefit the villages directly. All labor required
would be contributed free and voluntarily by the villagers,
while materials up to US$2,800 equivalent would be provided
through the Project to each of the participating villages.
(b)  Bench Terracing
About 1,000 acres of land would be terraced on slopes
between 250 ancl 50∞, of which half would be on lands currently
owned by marginal subsistence smallholders and the remainder
on unoccupied (avernment Crowlands. The latter would be
subdivided into two to four acre parcels and leased to land-
less householders in the villages concerned. Higher value
crops, such as ndxed vegetables, lychees, tomatoes and lettuce,
would be graow. Two acres are expected to give an annual
net cash incone of US$380 plus consumption of US$110 of home-



groln food. About 750 man-days of labor would be required to
build an acre of bench terracing, representing up to 1,850
job opportunities during the next two yeairs.
(c)  Aff ore station
Some 4,000 acres of scrub land would be planted with species
of pine and eucalyptus. The land clearance and plantation work
is highly labor-intensive. The labor requirement is about
one man-year per acre which would mean up to 2,500 job opportunities
during the next two years. Maintenance of the forests
would require about 300 men per year and ultimately, the
harvesting of the forests would require some additional 600
men per year.
(d) Fodder Planting
Lack of sufficient fodder year-round near villages is
one of the principal factors limiting increased milk
production. A total of 1,000 acres will be cleared and
planted in units of 10-30 acres adjacent to the villages
included in the Project. Labor requirements to clear and
plant the areas concerned are estimated at 260 man-days per
acre representing up to 550 job opportunities during
the nexct two years. Individual households would be leased
1/3 of an acre of fodder per cow and would have the sole right
to harvest the fodder from this land at an annual charge of
Rs 72 (US$13) per acre.
(e) Technical and Consultant Services
These services would be provided to strengthen and inprave
the capabilities of the Ministries of Economic Planning,
Agriculture, Works, Health and Town and Country Planning
involved in planning and project preparation and evaluation
as well as the management control, engineering and
architectural capabilities of the Development Works
Corporation.
(f) Training
This part of the Project would include the following:
-   in-service training of about 3,000 workers of the DWC in
semi-skilled trades such as carpentry, pipe-laying, masonry,
and repair of vehicles, equipment and office machinery;
-   in-country training of middle management and supervisory
staff of the DWC in management contrcl and accounting
systems by staff recruited internationally;
-   short overseas visits to countries with similar rural
development programs by senior Mauritian staff of the DWC

ard the Rural Development Unit who will administer the
principal components of the project.
Proj(e ct Implementation
17.         The oDverall rural development prograr i*rculd be cocrdinated byr the
Rural Development Conmtittee of the Cabinet (ICC) recently established and charged
with ove-rall project policy detorrLination.  This Committee, which would be
chaired Dar the Prine Itnister, would include most of the Cabinet Ydnisters.  It
wculd have as secretariat, the Rural Development Urnt (RDTJ). This unit, whic-
TTcuild be maintained. as a distinct entity within the Finistry of 'Eccrridc Planning
woulr. Include a Project Manager, senicr offlicers to coordinate the il e
improvement program, and a sma:Ll evaluaticn group to mndertake a detailed
assessment of the various costs and benefits of completed project components.
PDU would undertake overall coordination of project eleirients and would screen
proposed projects before presentation to the RDCC. The plarning units of the
key Mi-nistries, which would be responsible for projects preparation, would be
strengthened with technical assistance to ensure an adequate pipeline of
labor-intensive projects and a close nidnisterial cooperation on the follow-up
maintenance and staffing of projects.
18.         The Development works Corporation (N4C) would be the executing agency,
and would carry out the construction of the rural developrment projects. DNC
4s a corporate body established under the Development Works Corporation Act of
1970 with a Board responsible f'or policy decisions, and a General Manager
responsible for the management and control of the agency's day-to-day operations.
It is subject to the supervision of the Ministry of arployment. The implementation
of the proposed project would require the appointment of a Deputy General Manager
to take charge of the daily execution of the project.  DWC' s current activities
cover labor-intensive construction projects on primary school classrooms, roads,
village halls, fodder plantings, and afforestation. Assurances have been
obtained during negotiations that DWC would be allowed to exercise full respons-
ibility with regard to matters such as personnel policy and contract approvals and
that the General 11bLnager would be enabled to exercise his full executive
authority in accordance -wth the provisions of the Act.
1-'.        A substantial porti on of projected unemployyment in the next two years
is expected to be among young men 16 to 20 years old.   Accordingly, DNC has
agreed that no less than one-third of its additional working force would be
recruited from that age group. Lnother third is expected to be recruited from
relief workers to help reduce the number of people currently employed under that
program. The balance wculd be recruited by selecting people listed in the
registry of unemployed.. Since the objective of the "Travail pour Tous" program
is to provide employment to persons currently unemployed only until Yauritiusl
divnrsification  and industrialization program will make it possible to elirrinate
unemployment, the Government views the role of DlNrC as a temporary one and NC
is not tc compete with other employers, whether in the private or public sector,
as a source of permanent emplo-rent. The Borrower and NhC have undertaken to
ensure that these basic objectives are achieved. To that end, DWC will, among
other things, encourage its workers to seek jobs outside aN,C, discharge workers
who do not accept outside employment wvith corTarable wages and conditions, and
will continue to keep the current differential (22 percent) between the wage
package of its workers and the equivalent package received by unskilled



- 7 -
Government workers.  To stress further the temporary nature of DWC, the
Governnent has declared that DWC workers would not be included in the proposed
national pension scheme.
Project Costs and Financing
20.         The total cost of the project, including taxes and duties of about
US$800,000, is estimated at US$11.0 million equivalent with a foreign exchange
component of US$3.1 rmillion. The proposed IDA credit of US$4.0 million woald
finance 39 percent of the project cost (excluding taxes) covering US$2.0 million
of the foreign exchange cost and US$2.0 million of local expenditures. Parallel
financial support of US$1.8 million equivalent, representing 18 percent of total
project cost, is expected to be provided by UNDP, UNICEF, and bilateral aid
(U.S., U.K., France, India) which have been supporting the ongoing DWC rural
development program through contribution of food given to wvorkers in lieu of
wages (USAID), technical services (U.K., India, UNDP and France) and vehicles and
equipment (U.K. and UNICEF). The balance of US$3.7 million or 36 percent of
project cost (excluding taxes), as well as any shortfall in bilateral assistance,
would be provided by the Government of Mvuritius.
Procurement and Disbursement
21.         Labor represents the major cost of the project, but certain items
such as bitumen, cement, steel rods, water taps and pipes need to be purchased.
Contracts for these items, expected to represent about $600,000, would be auarded
after international competitive bidding in accordance with IDA Guidelines for
Procurement and would be phased over a period of two years.
22,         Disbursements would be made on the basis of statements of work
completed on eligible projects prepared by DWC. These statements would be
certified by the Project Manager prior to submission to IDA for reimbursement
through the Yinistry of Finance and IDA would reimburse 42 percent of the cost of
the village improvement, terracing, forestry and fodder components.   IDA would
also finance the foreign exchange costs of the technical, consultant and training
components of the projects other than those expected to be financed by other
contributors.
Benefits
23.         The project will give temporary employment to about 7,L00 currently
unemployed workers and, after completion, provide permanent employment for about
1,000 people. The project will thus help relieve the severe unemployment
problem that exists in Mauritius. In addition, most of the benefits of the project
are expected. to accrue to the lowest income groups. In the conditions prevailing
in Mauritius, the social and economic benefits arising from employment creation
and the alleviation of poverty are substantial. The project would also yield
direct economic benefits in the form of increased production of agricultural and
forest products, and the creation of infrastructure and social amenities at the
village level. No attempt has been made to calculate a rate of return for the
village improvement component, since most of the benefits would be of a non-
quantifiable kind such as better health care or improved water supply.   An attempt,
howrever, 7,Till be made through the system of monitoring and evaluation to assess
ex-post the impact of the program in improving village life. An imnportant
objective of making village life more productive and attractive is that permanent



- 8 -
migration of villagers to the Port Louis/Curepipe urban axis would be reduced.
Economic rates of return are estimated at 14 percent for bench terracing, 13
percent for fodder planting and 8 percent for afforestaticn; regarding
afforestation, this does nct take into account additional benefits such as
environmental improvements, soil conservation and erosion control.    Bench
terracing, fodder planting and afforestation represent about one-third of the
project.
PART V - I&MAL INSTRIIMENTS AND AUTHORITY
24.         The draft Developn,>ent Credit Agreement between the Association and
IMauritius, the draft Project Agreement between the Association and the Development
Works Corporation, the draft Supplementary Letters containing assurances by
Mauritius and the Development Works Corporation with respect to hiring and wage
policies, the Recomnendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section
1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association and the text of a draft
Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately. Ekcept ifor the provisions of Section 3.11 of the draft
Development Credit Agreemen-t and of the aforementioned Supplementary Letters
dealing with the issues covered in paragraph 19 above, the draft Credit documents
conform substantially to the pattern of the Association's agreements for rural
development projects.
125.        I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOIMMIDATION
26.         I recommend that the acecutive Directors approve the proposed credit.

THE ECONO1fY
(Paragraphs 3-16 of the President's Report of June 14, 1973, or a proposed
development credit to Mauritius for an industrial estate project, Report No.
IDA/R73-78).
3.          Mauritius is a small island, densely populated and heavily dependent
on one crop:  sugar. For decades it was considered a typical case of the vicious
circle of underdevelopment: the population pressure on land was associated with
a stagnation of investment and output; the very limited size of the national
market seemed to prevent the establishment of domestic induL-tries; the vagaries
of weather, and the generally unfavorable outlook for sugar lemand at that time,
inhibited attempts at increasing production and reducing unemployment.
4.          The present outlook is more encouraging and Mauritius may soon be
viewed as a typical case of a rapidly developing nation w^hich capitalizes on the
availability of cheap labor. In recent years, the Government has taken advantage
of favorable export sales of sugar over a few years to devise a development
stra-tegy which builds upon this asset. Recent economic and social performance
indicate that the Government's efforts and policies have been successful in
initiating promising changes in development prospects.
5.          In view of the land shortage and the limitations of the domestic
market, the 1971-1975 Development Plan aims at diversifying production towards
manufacturing for export and tourism, and at influencing the choice of
production techniques to utilize available labor more fully. The Plan provides
for a substantial step-up in the investment program, an increase in GDP growth
rate to 7 percent annually, as compared to an average of 2 percent in the
previous three years, and aims at the elimination of unemployment in the late
1970s. GDP has grown in excess of the target rate in 1971 and 1972.
6.          Value added in manufacturing is expected to increase at an average
annual rate of about 11 percent by attracting foreign capital and managerial
talents along the pattern set by Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. Developments
durig the last few years have shown that Mauritius' labor force can be trained
to carry out precision work; wages are below those of Hong Kong or Singapore.
A number of tax incentives and concessions are provided to export-oriented
industry, including an Export Processing Zone where imports of raw materials and
semi-finished goods can be processed. These measures have proved successful
and the pace at which industries hame been moving to 1Mauritius in the last two
years is promising. Given types of manufacturing wrhich lend themselves to
labor-intensive technology and the use of such technology, job creation in
manufacturing, together with its secondary employment effects can, it is believed,
produce an increase in employment more rapid than the growth of the labor force.
7.          Sugar production dominates the whole economy; it occupies more than
90 percent of cultivated land and contributes about 90 percent to merchandise
exports. Mauritius' 1971-1975 Development Plan also aims at greater
diversification in agriculture.  However, about 85 percent of potentially arable
land is occupied. Possible increases in the production of food crops and
livestock will thus have to be obtained on marginal sugar land as well as on new
land that may be developed under projects such as the proposed rural development

project referred to in paragraph 16 below. A new high-yield variety of sugar is
to be in.troduced at the time of replanting; it should allow, in the long rran,
to reduce land Lnder sugar wbile providing for the 2 percent annual increase in
sugarcane production proected in the Plan. As world consumption of sugar is
currently expected to rise faster than rroduction, Mauritius' export prospects
for sujgar continue to be favorable.
8.         Owing to the eradication of malaria and a sharp decline in the death
rates after the Second World War, population grew at about 3 percent annually
until thne mid-1960s. The crude birth rate reportedly fell from about L0 per
thousand in the early sixties to around 25 in the seventies, partly owing to a
successful birth control program, but the previous high rate of grow4th will lead
to a large and increasing nlmber of people entering the labor force for many years
to come. The labor force is expected to grow during the seventies at a rate of
9,000 per anrmn  compared wTith about 7,000 annuallv at the end of the sixties.
N7et emigration of workers is currently about 900 annually and the lacl of emlcy-
ment oportunities has resulted in an increase in unemployment. It is estirated
that about 16 percent of the total labor force is currently unemployed and
underemployment is considerable in agriculture.
9.         A major deterninant in increasing job opportunities and sustaIning
ecornomic grc!th will be Mauritius' ability to carry out higher vol-ues of
investment successfully.  DIuring the sixties, total invesstment stagnated and
actual capital expenditXure in the public sector averaged about 70 percent of
budget estimates.  Shortages of design ard engineering capacities in a number of
Ministries have slcwed down project preparation and implementation.  The currcrt
Plan -aims at a maj;or de-oarture from this situation. In 197h, gross investment
is to be more than double and public capital expenditure treble the amounts
spent annuallv in the late 1960s.  The Government acknowledges that these trrets
are ambitiorus; a number of measures to improve the efficiency of the
administratior and a substantial increase in external technical assistance are
underway.  Future levels of investment will depend to a great extent upon the
abilitar of the Government to devise and implement policies conducive to an
improvement in its absorptive capacity.
10.        A further determinant in increasing job opportmnities vl'l be the
Government's wage policy.  I4ruritiusr competitive positicr as a center for
Processing raw materials and semi-finished goods rests on its lot- wages and good
prcductivity.  yaintenance of the island's present advantage irrst be a majo3r
element in the Government's incomes policy.  The recent proposal by the Gcvern-mernt
to increase civil service salaries by ai average of 30 percent, following a
12 percent increase in 1971, is expected to lead to increases in the private
secter. TVese increases, hove'ver, have to be seen against the background cf
stable salaries through the sixties, during ihich tbe general price level
increasec by about 25 percent and as a measure for a more equitable sharing of
recent increases in profits in the sugar industry. To ensure that the wage
ircrease results in improved inccme distribution without leading to inflationary
pressures and other adverse effects on savings and investment, Govrernment is
expected to accormpny this salary increase with various institutionpl and. fiscal
measures. The miagritude of the; salary rises should reduce profits and. may
increase the export pricess olf rnufactured goods. The Goverment is consci ous
that wage increases reast be reconciled with the objective of increasing employment
by attracting new industries, but the proposed increase is not expected to reduce
substantially Miuritius' competitive adventage.



ANKNEX I
11.         Recent trends in national savings have been favorable.   This
resulted in part from the 13 percent annual increase in export earnings from
sugar between 1967 and 1972. In the same period, the savings rate increased
from 14 percent to about an estimated 17 percent.   Although most of the savings
vere provided by the private sector, public savings played an increasing role,
particularly due to Government efforts to reduce recurrent expenditures.
Whbereas national savings were more than sufficient to finance the low level of
investments in the 1960s, they are not expected to finance more than 80 percent
of the investment program of the current Plan. Even if particular efforts are
made to mobilize national resources, it is unlikely that the Government would
be able to finance more than half of the expected public investment program.
Foreign assistance should therefore continue to finance a substantial portion
-d   -i 'rc1ect costs including ocme local expenditures in appropriate cases
>t rf the foreiJgn component is low.
12.         Public capital inflows are e"pected to provide about US$70 million
to the public sector over the 1971-1975 period, as compared to US$17 million
over a similar pre-Plan period. This anticipated increase in foreign aid
disbursements would be accompanied by greater diversification of the sources of
aid. The United Kingdom, which used to provide abcut 90 percent of total
foreigr assistarce, is expected to remain the principal contributor, though its
share is only expected to be around 40 percent in the current Plan period. IDA
will provide a further 15 percent.   The association of IJauritius iwith the EEC,
-which became effective on June 1 of this year, may also involve some additional
aid from the European Development Fund. The balance of aid is likely to be shared
among a variety cf donors such as France, India, the Peoples Republic of China
and the United States.
13.         Official foreign reserves went up from US$13 million to US$70
million between end of 1967 and end of 1972.   They currently are equivalent to
more than seven months of merchandise imports. While they are likely to decline
if the investment program is carried out as expected, they should remain at a
rather high level. Ecport prospects are currently favorable. Foreign exchange
earr-ings from tourism are expected to rise from about US$7 million in 1972 to
US$9 million in 1975. If the increase in the price of sugar occurs as expected
and weather conditions renain favorable, and if industry continues to expand,
ahuritius' future export earnings should be able to make a major contribution to
the achievement of the country's new development strategy.
14.         Service paymnts on external public debt were about 4 percent of
foreign exchange earnings in 1972.   Assuming that most of the external borrowing
during the next few years is on cancessionaryr terms, the debt service ratio
should. rise onlyr modestly.  While Yauritius' debt service burden is not high,
poverty and the uncertainties about future export earnings, which depend on
sugar prices and the development of new industries, combine to justify continued
support on IDA terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.         The Bank made a loan of US$7 million to Mauritius in 1963 for a
power project, before the island gained independence in 1968. This loan,
guaranteed by the United Kingdom, has been fully disbursed. Since independence,



ANNEX I
Page 6
two IDA credits totalling US$8.7 million have been made, one in April 1971 for
agriculture (US$5.2 million - Tea Development Authority), and the other in June
1972 for industrial developmen-t (US$3.5 million - Development Bank of Pburitius).
The IFC made a loan of US$600,000 in June 1971 for the construction of two
beach hotels.  Annex II contains a surmry statement of the Bank loan, IDA
credits and IFC investment, as of April 30, 1973, as well as notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
16.         Future lending by -the Bank Group is designed to support the strategy
embodied in the Development Plan. The proposed rural development project would
assist the island in achieving the major employment objectives of the Plan -while
also promoting development in rural areas. At the same time, the proposed
industrial estate project, circulated on June 18, 1973, aims at helping
Mauritius pronote the growth of export-oriented industries.   In addition, a
recent forecast of the industrial lending and investment operations of the
Development Bank of Mauritius (DBMj) shows that a second IDA credit to DBM is
likely to be required by Decem)er 1973. Further projects currently under
preparation wolOd be designed to expand infrastructure facilities such as Port
Louis harbor, water supply and sewerage, and possibly power, in order to
alleviate what would otherwise soon become serious constraints to further
industrial gro-wth.

Credit 239-NAS - Yauritius Tea Develomrent Authority Project; $5.3 iillion
Credit. of' April Q, 19?1;  closi.ng. date: DIecemDber 31. 1977
This IProject constitutes the second phase of M4auritius' smallholder
tea develonrent program. Field development is satisfactory but a substantial
increase in cost has occurred, amounting to 51, over the anoraisal estima-te
mainly becpuse of a sharp increase in wages (60-t) and in costs of factories.
In agreement -with the Government, the percentage of disbursement and the
allocation oß credit proceeds have been revised to maintain disbu-rsement of
the IDA era   t until.. the Projec-- is completed.  In addition, difficulties
are bei^.' e-ountered in gettinlg people to settle on areps allocated for
smallholders. The Government is clurrentlv reviewing the scope of the Project
in the light of the continuing (lecline in tea prices.
