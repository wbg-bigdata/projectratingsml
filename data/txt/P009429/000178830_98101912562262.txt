I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
Background and Organization
1.01      The telecommunications sector in Bangladesh is composed of the
Bangladesh Telegraph and Telephone Board (TTB) and a small telecommunications
industry comprising two companies with factories for telephone switching
equipment and for cables, and TTB's "telegraph workshop". The
telecommunications sector functions under the Ministry of Communications
(MOC) with a secretary to the Government within MOC being in charge of the
Post, Telegraph and Telephone Department (PT&T) and having general
supervision over the sector. All public telecommunications services in
Bangladesh are a state monopoly with TTB having sole responsibility for
developing, operating and administering these services within Bangladesh and
to other countries.
1.02      TTB was established in July 1976 as required under IDA Credit
487-BD and reorganized in 1979 as a Government Board. Under government
supervision, the Ordinance which presently governs TTB's management and
operation enables an acceptable degree of autonomy in operating and
developing the services. TTB also operates special telecommunications
services such as maritime radio and provides specialized circuits for the
Bangladesh Broadcasting and Television Department, the Bangladesh railways,
civil aviation, and for various other government agencies or large users.
1.03      Independent private networks must be authorized by TTB which is
also responsible for the licensing and control of the radio spectrum usage.
An interministerial committee regulates the private networks, their use and
the allocation and control of radio frequencies. Given TTB's current
inability to provide adequate public services for the needs of the developing
economy (paragraph 1.18) numerous relatively high cost private VHF and HF
communication systems are licensed by TTB on a yearly basis. Examples
include government ministries, departments, The Forest Service, the Gas
Transmission Company, Rural Electrification Board, Inland Water Transport
Board, the Petroleum Organization, and the Buddhist Church.
1.04      The two companies comprising most of the small telecommunications
industry were established in 1970-71, and are jointly owned by the Government
as a majority shareholder (82 percent) and Messrs. Siemens A.G. of Federal
Republic of Germany (18 percent). One of the companies, Telephone Shilpa
Sangstha Ltd. (TSS), manufactures local telephone switching equipment,
telephone apparatus and small size PABXs. Its factory located in Tongui,
near Dhaka, employs about 1,000 people; production for FY80-81 was about
14,000 exchange lines of electromechanical EMD type equipment and 18,000
telephones. It is expected that full rated capacities of 20,000 lines and
30,000 telephones could be reached by FY82-83. The other company, Bangladesh
Cable Shilpa Ltd. (BCS), manufactures local and junction telephone cables and
drop wires. Its factory located in Khulna employs about 350 people;
production for FY80-81 was about 150,000 pair kilometers of cables, or 75
percent of the full rated capacity. While BCS is functioning reasonably well
with its prices comparable to those of similar factories elsewhere, TSS has
had to overcome technical staff shortages, employment difficulties, and high



- 2 -
prices for component parts during past years. This has resulted in delays in
establishing efficient organization and competitive production. TSS has yet
to reach full production efficiency. Also, any increase of TSS production
and diversification to produce other types of equipment, such as transmission
and telephone terminals equipment, depends upon the proposals now being
considered by TTB and the Government on the introduction of a modern
electronic switching system for the future (paragraphs 3.11 and 3.12).  The
procedure to follow is being studied by TTB, and GOB's decision on this would
be made under TTB's current development program (paragraph 2.01).
1.05       TTB's telegraph workshop produces tubular steel poles, line
materials and cabinets.
Access to Service
1.06      As of June 30, 1982, Bangladesh had about 110,000 direct exchange
lines (DELs) in service and 141,000 telephones of all kinds serving its
population of 93 million. Its telephone density of 1.3 telephones per 1,000
people is among the world's lowest. Annex 1 sets out international telephone
statistics in the main world regions and shows Bangladesh telephone density
as low even In relation to adjoining countries or countries with similar GNP
per capita _f
1.07      There is an imbalance of telephone development between urban and
rural areas, and in some parts of the country such as the south eastern and
the coastal areas telephone development has been hampered not only by
limitation of resources but also by difficulty of access. As of June 30,
1982, there were 410 telephone exchanges providing public telephone service
and 995 public call offices (PCOs) serving rural communities. About 91
percent of available telephones are concentrated in urban areas and over 90
percent of the population has no access to telephone service. Of the 68,300
villages and communities, only 1,080 (1.6 percent) have telephone
facilities. Under the first development plan, telephone coverage was
extended to the Thana level of the administrative organization (all 470 rural
Thanas or police stations are presently serviced by automatic, manual or PCO
telephones), and to about 12 percent of the union councils and rural growth
centers of which about 650 have now telephone facilities. Nonetheless, large
areas and sections of the population still have no service.
1.08      In order to obtain a telephone, applicants must register on a
waiting list. Connections are made according to the date of application and
the priority given to the applicant. The official priority list indicates
that Government and parastatal demand receives first priority. For private
demand, the priority of allocation runs roughly as follows: medical
facilities and important medical personnel, Chamber of Commerce and industry
1/ Bangladesh telephone density of 1.3 per 1,000 people can be compared to
that in some other low-income countries such as Burma 1.0; Sri Lanka 5.7;
Pakistan 4.3; India 3.8; Ethiopia 2.7; Nepal 1.2 per 1,000 population.



and trade associations; export oriented industries and exporters; newspapers
and important newspaper personnel; schools and colleges; banks and insurance
companies; large industrial concerns and factories; shipping companies;
airline companies and booking offices; oil exploration companies; etc.
1.09      To have an indication of how the system works in practice, the
identity of subscribers in a small market center about ten miles outside of
Dhaka was checked.  In this center there were 17 working connections in a
small manual exchange and 50 names on the waiting list. The telephones were
allocated as follows: seven telephones to public sector activities including
a local government administrative (circle) office, a government social
welfare office, a quasigovernment integrated rural development office, police
station, high school, and two public call offices (PCOs); and ten telephones
to private sector activities including two commercial banks and one
agricultural bank, a rice mill, two combination rice mills and shops, a
wholesale trader, seeds trader, petrol pump, and a contractor/builder.
Telephone Service Usage
1.10      TTB's tariffs do not discriminate between business and private
subscribers.  It is therefore difficult to determine actual usage per
subscriber category, but the relatively high revenues per subscriber line,
averaging about US$305 per annum in FY82, in such a low income country
indicate a very high proportion of business and government use of the
telephone facilities. Traffic generated in automatic exchange areas (about
70 percent of all subscribers) accounts for almost 85 percent of the total.
The Dhaka region generates about 62 percent of all telecommunications
revenues, though it accounts for less than half of the DELs in service.
Traffic data for the Dhaka central exchange show a very high average of 40
completed calls per telephone per day.   It is estimated that approximately
76 percent of the revenue from call charges correspond to local traffic, 19
percent to interurban and 5 percent to international traffic.
1.11      While detailed statistics on the usage of telephones in Bangladesh
by classification of user type are not available, some aggregate statistics
are available for Dhaka, and more detailed sample data are available for 12
smaller exchanges with between 100 and 300 working connections; three
exchanges in each of the four Divisions (regions) of Bangladesh (Annex 2).
1.12        These data show that in Dhaka 18 percent of all connections are
held by government, 11 percent by quasigovernment organizations (Electric
Power Board, Water Board, Railway Board, etc.), and 71 percent are classified
as private (commerce, business, industry, residential). The regional data
show that for the 1,893 working telephones in the 12 sampled regional
exchanges, 36 percent of the connections can be categorized as being public
service with 30 percent related to government administration and 6 percent
allocated to schools and colleges, doctors and nurses, hospitals and
dispensaries, and clubs and associations (Annex 2). Of the 64 percent of the
telephones which are classified as private, 56 percent are held by
commercial, business, and industrial users, while 8 percent are residential.
Many of the 56 percent of commercial, business and industrial users were
specifically identified as being shops, business offices, banks, industrial



- 4 -
factories, lawyers, agricultural farms, hotels and restaurantes, cinema and
theater, and business office and shop telephones listed under owners' names.
1.13      With regard to reasons for using specific business telephones, data
are available from interviews carried out at the Nabarun Jute Mill which
employs 1,200 employees and is located 20 miles up the Sitalakha River from
Dhaka, and the Ghorasal Fertilizer Factory which produces 240,000 tons of
fertilizer per year, and is located 40 miles from Dhaka up the same river.
Both enterprises recently received a TTB VHF radio telephone link with Dhaka
which provides them with a one party line telephone connection. At the jute
mill the telephone is installed in the manager's ofice and is used to make
10-15 calls each day and to receive a similar number. The calls are directed
mostly to the head jute company office in Dhaka which controls seven such
mills. The purpose of the calls relates to: (a) purchasing - materials,
spares, inquiries about orders; (b) exports - barge arrivals, scheduling and
n outing, determining quality of jute to be shipped and quality to be loaded
first; (c) production planning -- level and quality of jute to be produced the
following day; (d) general administration - payroll, personnel policy; (e)
labor problems - disputes, disruptions, staffing, conditions; (f) engineering
- plant maintenance, technical advice. The telephone is also available for
use in case of medical or other emergencies.
1.14      At the fertilizer factory the telephone is installed in a room
adjoining the general manager's office. Only the general manager and his
seven division heads are authorized to use the telephone. Calls made and
received relate primarily to: (a) liaison - dispatching of output,
coordination of barge traffic; (b) consultation with front office in Dhaka -
policy decisions, labor disputes, security or police needs, finance and
payroll; (c) supplies - order general supplies, spares, maintain inventory,
coordinate preventive maintenance; (d) emergency - breakdowns, technical
advice, accidents or sickness. The general managers of both the jute mill
and the fertilizer factory related that large cost savings had been
experienced as a result of the telephone installations (paragraph 3.15).
Existing Facilities and Quality of Service
1.15      As of June 30, 1982, Bangladesh had 109,865 DELs in service and a
total of about 141,000 telephones. Equipped capacity in exchanges was
145,000 lines of which 14,400 lines were manual. About 76 percent of the
exchange capacity are working connections which is normal in a growing
network. Long distance services in this flat country criss-crossed by large
rivers and waterways, are provided by microwave and UHF/VHF radio systems.
Practically all divisional, district center and subdivisional cities
(totaling about 100 places) are connected either directly to Dhaka by high or
medium capacity links where the importance or location of the city justifies
it, or to their divisional center using smaller capacity links. Most of the
long distance radio links were installed during the last ten years. The rest
of the country is served, where installations exist, with small capacity VHF
radio systems and in some cases with open wire lines.  International services
are provided by two satellite earth stations, one of a standard A type in
service since 1978 at Bethunia near Chittagong in the southeastern part of
the country and the second, of smaller standard B type, in service since



- 5 -
end-1981 at Taliabad, about 20 miles north of Dhaka. The systems are, in
general, normally conceived and installed, but in many cases are
underequipped so that the number of available circuits at Bethunia is
inadequate. Basic data on existing telecommunications facilities are given
in Annex 3. Annex 4 shows a summary of TTB's development targets and actual
achievements during FY73 to FY80 under the first five-year and the subsequent
two-year extension plans.
1.16      Because of the large unsatisfied demand (paragraph 1.18), existing
telephones are heavily used keeping them busy for long periods. This,
together with some underprovisioning, generates repeat call attempts and
results in call traffic congestion. In Dhaka, for example, it is necessary
to make four to five call attempts for each successful call during the peak
business day call hour. In the three principal cities of Dhaka, Chittagong
and Khulna, about 50 percent of the calls dialed by subscribers fail during
business hours--about 35 percent being due to the called number being busy or
no answer, the rest being technical (10 percent) or other faults.  Some of
the switching equipment and cables are very old and need replacing.
Maintenance standards are rather poor, further affecting the quality of local
service.
1.17      Many inadequacies, also, lead to poor quality long distance
services. The large capacity microwave routes from Dhaka to Chittagong and
Khulna were under installation and partly damaged during hostilities leading
to Bangladesh independence. Though restored and repaired, service remains
occasionally unreliable on these routes and consideration is being given to
their replacement. Where radio systems exist, the number of circuits
available are often inadequate. Many landline routes are of old or poor
construction and are plagued by frequent thefts of copperwire and
interruptions of service.  STD routes are subject to congestion and manual
boards are old and underequipped.  International services via the satellite
ground stations are technically satisfactory, principally with regard to
telex where subscriber dialling to most countries is available. However,
pending installation of the automatic international exchanges now in
progress, international telephone service is still provided through
operators, both ways.  Operators' dialling for outgoing traffic is available
only with the UK and West Germany. This results in high call traffic
congestion, principally on links such as with the USA where the time
difference reduces the number of hours which are effectively used for
traffic.  Also overall service is prejudiced by the inadequacy of the long
distance and local networks and by their congestion.
Demand for Service
1.18      Even in areas where access to service is available, the demand for
telephones far exceeds the available facilities. As at mid 1982, there were
about 110,000 working lines, and the expressed unsatisfied demand for new
telephones was 40,000, i.e. 36 percent of the working DELs. Current
expressed demand does not, however, fully reflect actual demand at existing
prices because:  (a) many potential subscribers are discouraged from applying
by the current long waiting lists and waiting periods (in excess of four
years in Dhaka and longer elsewhere); (b) demand is not registered in areas



- 6 -
currently without telephone service; and (c) in small towns, where telephones
are primarily used for long distance calls, potential subscribers and PCO
users are discouraged by the current poor quality of long distance telephone
service.
1.19      Given the very low level of past investment in the sector, the
large existing unsatisfied demand in those areas with some telephone service,
and the extensive areas of the country currently without service, it is
difficult to accurately forecast future demand.  On the grounds that it will
not be possible to meet even identifiable demand within the foreseeable
future, TTB has not yet made a systematic attempt to refine its demand
forecasts.
1.20      Expressed demand has increased historically by about 8 percent per
annum over the last ten years. With the increased economic activity and the
proposed extension of better service to new areas, an 11 percent yearly
increase in demand is the minimum to be expected during the SFYP. However,
TTB's current program will not meet such demand. The corresponding average
growth rate of facilities in service will continue to be about 9 percent per
annum which is slightly above TTB's past achievements but, due to present
large unsatisfied demand, will not prevent growth of the large waiting lists
for telephones.
1.21      TTB estimates of telephone demand are thought to be conservative
partly because once the quality of service is improved and the waiting period
for new connections reduced, there will almost certainly be a large increase
in expressed demand. TTB's longer term forecasts are that yearly increases
in demand will continue to be 11 percent from 1986 on. Historical and
forecast growth in demand and subscribers lines, and evolution of the waiting
list since 1970 and as forecasted during the current program period under the
SFYP (1981-85) are charted in Annex 5. As the following figures show
assuming that tariffs are generally maintained at present level in real
terms, even with such very conservative forecasts telephone waiting lists are
projected to grow over the 1983-1986 project period and continue to increase
after the SFYP unless the present low pace of development of TTB's
installations is gradually increased.

1.22      Available statistical information on the demand for interurban
traffic is limited to the last five years during which point to point STD
service was gradually extended between Dhaka and 17 other main provincial
cities or regional centers of economic activity. Observed traffic growth was
between 20 and 25 percent per annum on all links during several years
following the introduction of the service.  Traffic, however, has tended to
be limited due to an insufficient number of circuits. TTB is presently
doubling the number of STD circuits on most links in order to better cope
with demand pending the introduction of the nationwide dialing system (NWD)
now under construction as part of the ongoing second project under Credit
487-BD.
1.23      The four telex exchanges existing at the main regional centers have
a capacity of 520 lines with 480 working subscribers. Demand and usage have
grown at about 20 percent per annum over the last five years.  TTB's current
program provides capacity for 650 additional lines by 1984, e.g., a total
capacity of 1,170 which will maintain a 20 percent growth per annum of
working connections under the SFYP.

Sector Objectives
1.24      Based on discussions with TTB, the Ministry of PT&T, the Planning
Commission and the External Resource Division, the government objectives for
the telecommunications sector under the government's second five-year plan
period are to:
(a)  initiate an immediate improvement of telecommunications
services. This includes quality improvements as well as
a significantly increased sophistication and quantity of
telecommunications facilities;
(b)  increase penetration of telephone services into small
towns and remote areas. The share of rural telephones
will be roughly increased by 60 percent by 1985;
(c)  continue present efforts towards improvement of the
sector production and efficiency, by strengthening TTB's
development planning, construction and operational
capability and by improving the organization and
productivity of TTB's operations and of the domestic
industry;
(d)  continue recent improvements toward the semi-autonomous
organization and management of TTB to facilitate the
financing of all of TTB's own local currency needs, and
the generation of substantial financial surpluses for
Government for use in other sectors; and
(e)  begin the changeover to a more modern electronic
switching and networking base for the national
telecommunications system in the medium and longer term,
and initiate the transformation of the domestic industry
to the new technologies and sectoral requirements.
1.25      For implementation of the above objectives, TTB under the SFYP
would carry out a FYs81-85 development program (including the proposed
project) which is larger than what was achieved under previous plans as
illustrated in the following table:

Sector Constraints
1.27      The major constraints on the improvement and development of the
sector are:
(a)  the need to further improve TTB's organization and
functioning. TTB's new organization as a Government
Board was part of the preparation of this project.
However, although the present ordinance ruling TTB's
operations and development constitutes a workable
framework, TTB's powers and relationship with the
Government could yet be improved;
(b)  the rate at which TTB can improve its development
planning and implementation capability. In particular,
TTB's ability to plan and coordinate the activities of
the local suppliers for buildings and local networks
construction, and for equipment produced in Bangladesh
with those of the foreign suppliers must be
strengthened. Productivity in general and the quality of
the service offered must also be improved;



- 10 -
(c)  the limited foreign exchange funds available for
telecommunications development;
(d) the need to finalize arrangements for the introduction of
a modern electronic switching system which will offer
both service and economic advantages, including foreign
exchange savings; and
(e) the large unsatisfied demand for service which results in
the continued overload of the networks and traffic congestion.
The Bank Group's Role
1.28      IDA has been involved, principally, in two telecommunications
projects in Bangladesh. The first project (Credit 343-BD) was approved in
November 1972, followed by the second project (Credit 487-BD) in June 1974.
Following Bangladesh independence in December 1971, Credit 343-BD essentially
took over transmission systems committed but not completed and material
already delivered and paid, which were part of Credit 145-PAK made in 1969 to
Pakistan for the then eastern part of the country. In addition, two other
IDA projects for cyclone area rehabilitation and protection (Credit 339-BD)
and for reconstruction imports (Credit 345-BD), respectively approved in
October and November 1972, had substantial telecommunications components. In
all, the Association has provided a total of US$35.6 million for development
of the telecommunications sector. Projects under Credits 339- and 343-BD
were both completed by September 1980 and corresponding completion reports
are being prepared with government contributions. Data on the concerned IDA
credits and summary information on the projects, their implementation and the
Bank Group's role are given in Annex 7.
1.29      The two main IDA-assisted telecommunications projects have enabled
the telephone system in Bangladesh to be expanded by about 70,000 exchange
lines or more than 50 percent of the present installed capacity. Exchange
service was extended to 115 additional centers and 340 additional PCOs were
provided of which about 300 provided first service to distant rural
commununities or administrative centers. The two projects, together with the
cyclone reconstruction project for coastal areas under Credit 339-BD,
established the foundation for a modern domestic interurban network.
1.30      In addition to sector expansion, IDA's projects had important
institutional and organizational elements to improve and strengthen sector
organization and operation.  In particular, Credits 343-BD and 487-BD
required that a Board be established by Government to be responsible for
public telecommunications services within the country.  The Board was to
replace the previous Telegraph and Telephone Department organization. The
Board's administration and functioning was to be based on commercial
principles and procedures of operation.  Several problems and delays slowed
the effective implementation of this facet of the project. At IDA's
insistence, it required three successive ordinances in 1975, 1976 and 1979 to
have a workable framework for TTB's operations and development. IDA
exercised intense supervision during recent years to obtain compliance with
the credit covenants and in July 1980, GOB agreed to transfer the accounting



- 11 -
function from the Government Comptroller and Auditor General to TTB and to
progressively introduce a commercial accounting system and improved financial
management procedures within TTB. As in previous projects, IDA's continued
involvement in the sector is now important to ensure satisfactory progress
and to maintain the necessary assistance in TTB's institution building. The
SFYP period will be a very taxing one for Government and TTB management due
to both the greater management autonomy being progressively introduced within
TTB, and the major developmental efforts to be made by TTB under its present
program.
1.31      In the above context, the most important objectives of the Bank
Group telecommunications lending strategy in Bangladesh are to:
(a) improve and strengthen TTB's organization, particularly
in the fields of development planning and implementation,
finance, accounts, revenue, and collection and analysis
of management information data;
(b) improve TTB's administration and technical methods and
procedures to achieve high operational efficiency; and
(c) improve financial viability of TTB with adequate internal
cash generation to finance its own development programs.
At this stage when TTB is a fledging organization, IDA's role and
participation is of crucial importance in ensuring that TTB develops into a
sound, commercially oriented and financially viable organization. In
general, IDA is able to assist TTB over a wide spectrum of managerial,
financial, operational and developmental activities and, in particular, guide
TTB towards correct decisions on pricing, investment priorities, procurement
and national standards at a time of rapid technological evolution in the
sector. TTB is staffed with young, qualified personnel now gaining
experience, who will benefit from such assistance.
II.  THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
2.01      TTB has prepared a comprehensive telecommunications investment
program to cover the period July 1980 to June 1985 of the SFYP.  The program
has been designed to meet the sector objectives set out in paragraph 1.24.
TTB will implement all works which include the following components: (a)
ongoing works from previous plans and new works under SFYP already completed
and/or committed in FYs8l and 82 for completion by the end of FY85, at a
total cost of about Tk 1.58 billion (US$71.9 million) with a foreign exchange
component of Tk 664.4 million (US$30.2 million) for which financing is mostly
secured.  (The about US$6.8 million remainder of the second IDA project under
Credit 487-BD, and a backlog of about 12,000 exchange lines and the NWD
system are part of these works); (b) new works remaining to be committed and
implemented under the SFYP at an estimated total cost of Tk 1,730.8 million



- 12 -
(US$78.7 million) with a foreign exchange component of Tk 683.7 million
(US$31.1 million) for construction from FY83 to FY85 (the proposed IDA third
project represents about 79 percent of these works for completion in FY86);
and (c) preinvestment for future development works to be undertaken during
FY85 at an estimated expenditure of Tk 168.0 million (US$7.6 million). Annex
6 describes the main facilities to be added from FY81 to FY85. GOB is in the
process of giving its final approval to TTB's program.  Important parts
representing about 48 percent of this program have already been carried out
and/or started and committed in FYs8l and 82, essentially made of works
carried over from previous plans and continued works for expansion of the
local networks.
2.02      The estimated total cost of TTB's investment program for FY81 to
FY85 (excluding future works) is Tk 3.31 billion (US$150.6 million) with
foreign costs of Tk 1.35 billion (US$61.3 million). The local and foreign
costs of the different components and the estimated yearly expenditures are
given in Annex 8. Based on past experience, it is expected that all
expenditures from the SFYP will be made only by the end of FY86.
Preinvestment expenditures for works under the next program have also been
shown indicatively for FY85 and FY86.
The Project
2.03      The proposed project is part of TTB's program under the SFYP, it
includes priority new works for construction from January 1983 to December
1986.  The project components were selected with TTB and discussed with PT&T
and the Planning Commission and represent the core of TTB's program during
the last three years of SFYP. The project includes provision and
installation of the following:
(a) installation of local digital telephone exchanges for
about 16,000 additional subscriber lines in the greater
Dhaka region, including one main local/tandem exchange
with an associated sub-exchange, satellites and
concentrators for distant subscribers, and PCM
transmission systems on existing and new local cable
junctions;
(b) rehabilitation, reconstruction and expansion of local
cable networks in the main urban areas where underground
and overhead outside plant are used for local line
networks to enable the re-distribution and new connection
of about 35,000 subscriber lines;
(c) provision of long distance transmission facilities,
including one 960-channel microwave link (with broadband
RF channels for relaying of TV programs and one standby
bearer link) on the backbone Dhaka-Chittagong route,and
additional analog multiplex equipment for about 2,800
channels on existing primary and secondary links;



- 13 -
(d) installation of 16 base stations for multiaccess VHF
radio systems with medium and small capacity and a range
to expand service to new rural and isolated zones,
together with 20 UHF links of 6 and 24 channel capacity
on tertiary routes, small exchanges and terminal
subscriber/PCO installations to provide and improve
access to telephone service for about 2,600 rural
subscribers, and 90 long distance PCOs;
(e) provision of receivers and associated equipment to enable
using the INTELSAT V space segment at the existing earth
station for international satellite communication;
(f) construction of technical buildings for telephone
exchanges and transmission centers at 24 locations and
the provision of air conditioning and ancillary building
equipment, local network constructional and operational
aids and testing equipment;
(g) construction and equipment of a small regional
telecommunications training center at Bogra for about 120
trainees at the telephone and telegraph technician level;
and
(h) provision of technical assistance for program/project
planning and implementation, for organization of TTB's
finances and commercial accounts, and for related
overseas training of TTB staff.
Supplementary data on the physical project works and their implementation are
given in Annex 9 and in project file.
2.04      The project's estimated total cost is US$69.7 million equivalent
(Tk 1.53 billion) with a foreign exchange component of US$29.0 million. The
other proposed new works under SFYP, making up the balance of TTB's proposed
program during the plan period and not included in the project, are estimated
to cost US$9.0 million (Tk 197.4 million) with a foreign exchange component
of US$2.1 million (Annex 8).  These other works represent the parts of TTB's
program which are still under consideration by GOB for final approval and
confirmation of their construction schedule. They include additional works
for further expansion of rural coverage and local networks in the provinces,
construction/expansion of buildings, improvement of ancillary services and
the establishment of a staff college with financial and technical assistance
from the UNDP and the ITU under a scheme now being discussed. Annex 10 gives

The proposed project represents about 65 percent of the remaining part of
TTB's investment program for construction from FY83 to 85, and 89 percent of
the new works still to be committed and implemented during the last three
years of SFYP.
Project Cost Estimates and Contingencies
2.05      The project costs are based on estimated early 1983 equipment
prices as experienced by TTB with recent contracts. Local works are
estimated at current costs. Customs duties on imported items and taxes as
paid by TTB are included; this represents about US$15.8 million equivalent
(Tk 347 million) for the project and US$32 million equivalent (Tk 700
million) for TTB's FY81-85 program as a whole.  The foreign costs of the
locally produced switching equipment and cables, as shown in the program's
cost estimates, represent the cost of imported goods and commodities for
production of such items. Technical assistance costs are based on an average
of US$11,000 per manmonth for consultants and experts and US$3,400 for
trainees, including as applicable the manmonth rates, reimbursable items such
as travel, subsistence and other allowances in the country of service.
2.06      In preparing its project applications for Planning Commission
approval, TTB does not provide for contingencies. However, for projects
extending over several years, Government allows estimated figures to be
exceeded by up to 10 percent during project execution. No physical
contingencies are provided as the proposals are based on detailed engineering
for systems having specific capacities and using equipment of types already
in service in Bangladesh. For cables and multiplex equipment, and for
telephone exchanges whose capacities are planned and installed for several
years of expansion, reductions in some areas would be expected to compensate
for equipment increases in others within the overall network forecast.
2.07      Price contingencies for the imported items to be financed by IDA
have been included based on expected increases in equipment costs of 8
percent annually during the project period.  These figures have been related
to the expected dates of procurement. This results in a composite rate of
about 19.3 percent of base cost for these items. Local project costs are
expected to increase by 11 percent per annum to reflect inflation rates; this
results in a composite rate of about 35.4 percent of base local costs. For
both foreign and local costs, some economies of scale are expected to result
from larger orders for grouped equipment and works to be placed by TTB under
the project; this was taken into account.  In the case of bilaterally
financed contracts for equipment or for supply of goods for the factories,
ongoing and proposed financing usually include built-in contingencies or
correspond to actual firm orders for the concerned goods or works;
contingencies were provided for local costs only. Local cost contingencies
for customs duties are included, based on foreign cost inflation. For the
project as a whole, price contingencies represent about 22.0 percent of the
total project cost.

Project Financing
2.08      Project costs will be financed as follows:
Tk Millions    US$ Millions          %
IDA                       770.0             35.0            50
Japan                       79.2             3.6             5
TTB                        583.8            26.5            38
GOB                         99.7             4.6             7
TOTAL                1,532.7             69.7           100
2.09      For the foreign funds financing of its investment program, TTB has
to rely on government borrowed sources. The project items needing outside
financing are indicated in Annex 10. Japanese financing of US$3.6 million
for the Dhaka-Chittagong microwave link is confirmed. During negotiations,
the status of Japanese and other possible sources of financing were reviewed
in the context of TTB's program and project and assurances were obtained that
GOB would provide TTB with necessary funds for their implementation.
Execution of the financing arrangements between GOB and Japan (US$3.6
million) would be a condition of effectiveness.
2.10      The proposed IDA credit of US$35.0 million would be to the
Government of Bangladesh on standard IDA terms and would finance about
50 percent of total project costs. Government would transfer to TTB the
proceeds of the proposed IDA credit, and funds transferred and outstanding
would bear an interest rate of 11.5 percent per annum.  The period of this
transfer arrangement would be for 20 years, including a grace period on
capital repayments of five years. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that an Administrative Order would be established in this
regard. The execution of this Order between GOB and TTB, acceptable to IDA
and reflecting the above, would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
Procurement
2.11      Goods and Services.  Equipment, materials and services, including
installation where applicable, totaling US$25.4 million including
contingencies would be grouped in appropriate bidding packages and procured
by ICB in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. Qualifying domestic
manufacturers would receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent or
the import duty, whichever is the lower. Some small items of miscellaneous
equipment which are required for early delivery and for some of which only a
limited number of suppliers exist, would be procured in packages less than
US$60,000 and totaling not more than US$0.9 million approximately, in
accordance with current Government and TTB procurement practice which is
acceptable to IDA.



- 17 -
2.12      Civil Works and Outside Plant Construction.  The balance of works
and construction materials to be financed under the project, totaling US$9.6
million including contingencies, consist of civil works for duct
construction, cable laying and outside plant materials, and for technical
buildings in 25 locations including the Bogra Training center. These works
and buildings of estimated contract size of less than US$0.5 million are
scattered throughout the country and are not likely to interest foreign
bidders. These works would be procured through local competitive bidding
procedures as currently applied by Government and TTB which are satisfactory
to the Association. Foreign bidders would have the opportunity to
participate. Corresponding contracts would be financed up to 80 percent of
their cost, representing the estimated net of taxes component of such
contracts.
2.13      Contract Review.  For procurement of imported goods and services
under paragraph 2.11 above, of which contracts are expected to amount to
US$250,000 or more, procurement documentation will be submitted to IDA for
prior review resulting in a coverage of about 92 percent of the estimated
value of the contracts for goods and services.  Consultants will be engaged
in accordance with IDA's guidelines. The contracts for civil works and
construction materials for local subscriber outside plant and buildings will
be subject to post review by IDA.
Project Implementation
2.14      The project will be implemented by TTB.  In order to better assure
efficient planning and implementation of the program/project, and the
satisfactory operation and maintenance of the existing and more complex new
network, a substantial technical assistance element is included in the
project. Details of this assistance which is provided in addition to the aid
already available to TTB for present switching systems and local cable
networks are given at Annex 9.   TTB's staff will install most of the
transmission and local network equipment except for microwave and UHF systems
which will be installed by the suppliers or with their assistance; the
supplier will install the imported electronic exchanges. Acceptance and
commissioning tests would be carried out by TTB. Works under the project are
expected to be completed by March 1987.
2.15      With the proposed technical assistance, project implementation is
expected to take place as per the schedule set out in Annex 11. Due to the
delay of previous IDA-financed projects which resulted from budgetary
constraints,  special assurance were obtained from GOB during negotiations
that adequate annual budget amounts will be approved for the TTB development
program.  In order to ensure adherence to the proposed implementation
schedule it is essential that TTB initiate early action on procurement of the
goods which are proposed for IDA financing. Bid documents for equipment such
as radio and transmission systems are being prepared. Tenders for these
items are expected to be issued by the end of April 1983 and contracts
awarded before the end of 1983. During negotiations, the status of said
procurement was reviewed and corresponding procurement documentation agreed
upon. Assurances were obtained that, as a condition to credit effectiveness,



- 18 -
tenders would have been issued for goods representing approximately 20
percent (US$7.0 million) of the credit amount.  TTB would also have to take
advance action on the recruitment of two key consultants under the project
(paragraphs 4.07 and 4.09). Progress in this respect were reviewed during
negotiations, and assurances were obtained that TTB has taken effective
action to engage the services of these two key consultants mutually
acceptable to TTB and IDA.
Disbur sements
2.16      Disbursement would cover 100 percent of foreign exchange costs of
imported goods (CIF cost) and services, including consultants and staff
training, under the project (paragraph 2.11).  If either cables, subscriber
apparatus, switching or transmission equipment is procured by ICB from the
local factories, the IDA credit would be disbursed against 100 percent of the
ex-factory prices (excluding excise duty and sales tax) of these items. In
the case of civil works and outside plant contracts, of materials to be
procured locally (paragraph 2.12), and of locally appointed firms for
accounting and managerial improvement, disbursement would be made against
80 percent of the contracts cost net of taxes or consultants fees.
2.17      A projected disbursement schedule is given at Annex 12.  For
practical considerations and in line with previous IDA disbursement
experience in the telecommunications sector for the region and the country,
the proposed credit is expected to be fully disbursed only by the end of
1986. This also takes into account the fact that some complex systems under
the project require extended first operation and guarantee periods before
completion, holding some retention payments.
Performance Indicators
2.18      To help TTB's management and IDA monitor project implementation and
operational and financial performance, indicators are given in Annex 13. The
performance indicators and the expected annual variations have been chosen so
as to demonstrate TTB's degree of success in installation and operation of
equipment, in improving service coverage and quality, in making agreed
staffing improvements, and in improving its operational and financial
performance.  The performance indicators were discussed and the corresponding
targets for developing TTB's facilities and for progressively increasing
productivity, efficiency and quality of the services were agreed upon during
negotiations.  These indicators will be included in TTB's half-yearly reports
to IDA.  Financial reports will be transmitted as per paragraph 4.13.
III. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.01      The economic analysis relates primarily to the whole of TTB's
FY81-FY85 investment program of which the proposed IDA-assisted project is an
integral part.  The program has been established to support government's
economic program under the SFYP. As outlined in paragraphs 1.18 to 1.23
there is a large unsatisfied demand for telephone and telex services in
Bangladesh and TTB's proposed investment program is expected to meet only
part of this demand.



- 19 -
Telecommunications and Development
3.02      Since independence in late 1971, Bangladesh has faced many special
problems in developing an integrated economy while establishing itself as a
nation. These include: the country's recent history with the need to
politically and administratively create a nation and ensure its existence and
economic growth in difficult conditions of scarce physical resources,
overpopulation and lack of expertise; the administrative and social upheavals
and economic changes that followed independence; the physical conditions in
the country where land is divided by large rivers and inland waters with
intricate and seasonably variable surfaces and distribution; the dispersal
throughout the country of a dense population and limited natural resources;
and the frequent exposure of large parts of the country to cyclones and
climatic disturbances. Reflecting the population pattern, economic and
social activity is widely spread over the country where communication and
transportation are difficult and slow. Many essential services involve use
of staff with limited expertise who may have to obtain advice or direction
from more qualified individuals at the main center.   The country's
administration, through its regional divisions, has substantial information
requirements. Also, over large parts of the country, timely information on
climatic disturbances and cyclones is of primary importance to economic life
and civil protection. All these aspects highlight the need for adequate
telecommunications facilities, which by providing a means of rapid two-way
communication form an essential part of the infrastructure required for
national development and for ensuring effective use of available resources
and expertise. GOB fully recognizes that a free and rapid flow of
information is a prerequisite for economic and social growth and for
efficient public and private sector administration.
3.03      Among its development objectives, the SFYP gives priority to more
efficient and expanded production in agriculture and industry, and to better
and expanded use of the country's energy resources.  These priorities are in
line with the government's basic economic policy of import substitution.
Production and consumption in agriculture, industry and energy involve the
coordination of a series of operations which are highly dependent on adequate
telecommunications facilities to coordinate at all levels the inputs and
outputs, the production itself, the sales, distribution and use of products
and the sectoral growth in each case. With the country relying largely on
imported oil supplies, the efficient use of limited and costly transportation
facilities is also a vital necessity, and these facilities can best be
coordinated through adequate telecommunications services.
3.04      TTB's investment program within the SFYP has been designed to
contribute to the above objectives. It will also have a significant impact
on the development of government administration, and on public and private
businesses by facilitating communications-related efficiency increases. In
Bangladesh, telecommunications is the least cost means of communication for a
wide variety of economic, social and welfare activities. In particular, the
transportation sector, including railways, roads, and river navigation
systems, should achieve a significantly better utilization of existing
facilities with accompanying lower costs in transport of people and goods,



- 20 -
and faster repair and turnaround. In line with GOB's policy of rural
development, service coverage will be expanded into many population centers
and rural areas presently with no access to even basic PCO facilities, and
demand will be better met in outlying areas where existing services are of
poor quality (paragraph 1.26).
Distribution of Benefits
3.05      The distribution of benefits from the proposed program should touch
all segments of the population in Bangladesh through increased Government and
business efficiency and the resulting lower costs for goods and services.
The program, and particularly the third telecommunications project, will have
a significant impact on access to telecommunications service to currently
unserved smaller urban and rural communities. The share of rural telephones
in number of lines will increase from the present 6 to about 10 percent
(paragraph 1.26).  Sixteen additional rural zones covering large parts of the
country's outlying areas with large rural populations will be served with
radio telephone systems enabling a substantial new segment of the population
to gain access to telephone service for the first time through the
introduction of small exchanges and PCOs. In such areas, telecommunications
is part of the infrastructure linking villages to each other and from them to
the major towns and cities. Rural telecommunications are important to summon
help in an emergency and are used to find markets for agricultural produce
and to arrange deliveries and order supplies.
3.06      These uses of telecommunications fit within a framework of the
rural resident's needs for information--which are varied and are met in a
variety of ways.  In general, the use of the telephone in rural areas of
Bangladesh, as opposed to other forms of communication, appears to depend on:
(a) quality of the road or other transportation infrastructure--if these are
very poor or slow, the telephone becomes a more important alternative; (b)
distance to be covered; and (c) quality of the telephone service. Also
telephone access in rural areas is particularly important in instances of
supply shortages and of extreme weather or climatic conditions.
3.07      TTB has a much wider impact on the other sectors of the Bangladesh
economy than is apparent from telephone statistics. For example, the
transfer of funds to and from Government over the 1983-1986 period results in
a net surplus in favor of Government of about Tk 1,850 million
(US$84 million). This surplus is made up by the interest received by
Government from TTB less interest paid by Government on funds onlent to TTB.
Government also receives customs duties and taxes paid by TTB on program
expenditure. From the sum of these is deducted government contribution to
program financing.



- 21 -
Taka millions
Net interest payments to Govt.        1,660

2,360
Less government program financing        510
Net Surplus to Government        1,850
Such local funds are available for investment in other sectors.
Tariff Policies
3.08      A summary of TTB's present tariffs is given in Annex 14.
Telecommunications tariffs were increased in 1973, 1976 and 1979, the
increases averaging 50, 66 and 35 percent respectively. This is above the
rate of inflation over the period. From 1977 to 1981, TTB net internal cash
generation financed about 30 percent of its capital expansion. It is
expected that such internal cash generation will represent the equivalent of
about 39 percent of program costs during the 1981-1985 project period, a
period during which the network will grow by about 50 percent and its
sophistication will increase.
3.09      TTB's tariff structure is generally in line with current practice
in many developing countries. It provides for somewhat higher prices in the
larger urban areas and less costly telephone service for subscribers outside
these areas.  Telephone connection and annual rental charges are set
essentially according to the size of the subscribers' local network. They
range from Tk 500 (US$28) for both charges in a small 100 line manual
exchange to Tk 2,000 (US$112) for connection and Tk 720 (US$40) for annual
rental for subscribers in divisional multi-exchange areas. A similar
arrangement applies to manual and STD trunk calls. To encourage off-peak
usage, long distance tariffs are reduced by 50 percent between 09:30 p.m. and
08:30 a.m. As concerns provision by TTB of specialized services, the
Bangladesh Television Department (BTV) is using, since 1978, broad-band RF
channels provided by TTB to relay its programs to the TV transmitters within
the country, and for international programs through satellites. No charges
have been applied yet for the service. Appropriate tariffs have been
discussed between TTB and BTV and, at time of appraisal, were to be agreed
soon. Confirmation of the agreement reached was obtained from GOB at
negotiations. FY83 will be the first full year of effective implementation
of BTV's tariffs.
3.10      Following the introduction of effective commercial and cost
accounting in its operations, TTB should be in a position, during the project
period, to better compare tariffs with the costs of specific services and, in
particular, to analyze and assess the usage and costs of the new NWD system
which will be introduced in 1983. Based on this and while efforts are made
to meet an increased portion of demand, increased short-term price rationing



- 22 -
measures are justified, and will be considered by TTB and GOB in order to
both improve the quality of service and flow of traffic, and to meet an
increased portion of the costs of TTB's expansion program. Such measures
would also generate increased telecommunications financial surpluses for use
by Government in other sectors. During negotiations, policy on future
tariffs was discussed with Government and TTB. In order to be consistent
with the above tariff policy objectives and to achieve the agreed rate of
return of not less than 15 percent on revalued assets for FY84 and
thereafter, it was agreed that tariff increases averaging 25 percent would be
made effective by TTB by December 1983 (paragraph 5.10). Financial
projections assume such tariff increases. Further tariff increases may be
justified during the project period.
Least Cost Solution
3.11      The configuration of the existing network and the development
targets proposed under TTB's program do not give much scope for alternative
technical designs. The dimension and timing of the major works included in
the project are based on engineering studies made by TTB with assistance from
expatriate experts. They are designed to determine the least cost solution
for each work using standard analytical techniques and provisioning periods
to maximize economies of scale. The overall program is largely underway in
cooperation with the existing local industry supplies (paragraph 1.04) for
continued expansion of the local networks, and through ICB for equipment not
produced locally. Within this context, the proposed project is considered to
be the best compromise which can be adopted given sectoral priorities, the
limitations on available foreign exchange, and TTB's implementation
capabilities.  The need to progressively and adequately introduce new
technologies in the networks and the local industry has also been considered.
3.12      TTB and GOB are aware of present rapid evolution and worldwide
advances in telecommunications technology, in particular electronic switching
and digital techniques, and of the resulting changes in network design and
equipment. The adoption of digital technology for the higher level trunk and
international exchanges, which are not manufactured locally, had been decided
by TTB under the previous program. Some such equipment is being installed
under Credit 487-BD. With regard to local exchanges, TSS is presently
producing about 12,000 lines a year of electromechanical EMD equipment
(paragraph 1.04).  Based on TTB's figures, the cost of EMD production per
line, excluding customs duties, is about US$370 with a foreign exchange
component of about US$140. This cost is high compared with world market
prices ranging between $200 and $350 per line for more modern equipment
offering additional facilities together with significant savings in external
plant, accommodation and operation. Early in 1981, GOB and TTB set up a
study group to examine the sector position in relation to the change of
technology for local switching equipment and its introduction.  The group has
now recommended that electronic digital technology should be adopted as the
future standard for Bangladesh. This recommendation is in line with present
worldwide trends. To select an appropriate system, TTB intends to use ICB
under the proposed IDA project for the supply and installation of a pilot
local network in the greater Dhaka region which would include switching and
transmission equipment, together with operation and maintenance supervision



- 23 -
facilities, and new services capabilities. To avoid proliferation of
different types of new equipment, it is desirable in the meantime to continue
to meet the immediate needs for switching with the older and higher cost EMD
equipment produced by TSS. The current program has been prepared
accordingly.
Return on Investment
3.13      The internal financial rate of return on the program, defined as
the discount rate which equalizes the present value of cost and revenue
streams (at 1982 constant prices) attributable to the program is about 26
percent. Details of the calculation of the rate of return are given in
Annex 15.
3.14      This rate of return understates the benefits to be derived from the
investment program, partly because the benefits stream used in the
calculation does not take into consideration a major portion of the indirect
and external benefits which are received by nonusers of the service. It also
does not include much of the consumer surplus which telephone users receive.
After applying a standard conversion factor of 0.83 to local costs and
benefits, the minimum quantifiable estimate of the economic rate of return on
the program is 24 percent.
3.15      Sample data were also collected relating to cost savings
experienced by the Nabarun Jute Mill and the Ghorasal Fertilizer Factory as a
direct result of the installation of the radio telephone link to Dhaka at
each enterprise (paragraphs 1.13 and 1.14). Estimates of the savings in
petroleum costs at both firms indicate that during the first year following
telephone installation the savings in gasoline consumption alone will exceed
the total cost of the additional radio telephone equipment, installation, and
maintenance by almost 1.5 times (Annex 16).
Risk
3.16      The project offers limited risk.  The principal risk is the
possibility of delayed physical implementation due to unforeseen
circumstances and any accompanying delay in benefits. In telecommunications
projects, which involve a relatively large number of independent activities,
delay in the completion of a few works does not generally prevent the use of
other newly created assets.  Furthermore, costs and benefits are often
delayed in roughly the same degree, so the impact on the rate of return may
not be significant. A sensitivity analysis on the internal financial rate of
return (Annex 15) shows that a combination of 10 percent higher capital costs
and 10 percent lower revenues would result in a return of 20 percent.
Environmental and Health Aspects
3.17      Telecommunications projects have very little direct impact on the
environment. The plant is mostly unseen and it consumes little energy.
Through its use as an alternative to communications involving physical
movements, however, telecommunications has the potential to conserve energy,
reduce environmental pollution, and facilitate such items as health services
delivery, civil protection and emergency care.

IV. THIE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
Organization
4.01      Responsibility for and organization of the sector are described in
paragraphs 1.01 to 1.05.
Telegraph and Telephone Board (TTB)
4.02      TTB is a Government Board acting under the 1979 Telegraph and
Telephone Board Ordinance No. XII/79.  TTB has a Board of Directors on which
there are representatives of Ministries of Finance, PT&T and Establishment.
The day-to-day operations of TTB are controlled by the Chairman of the Board,
to whom Members of Planning and Development, Maintenance and Operation,
Administration, and Finances report directly. TTB's present organizational
chart is shown at Annex 17.
Management and Control
4.03      The management of operations and planning operate reasonably well.
In the past the areas of budgeting and financial control have not functioned
well. At IDA's insistence to obtain compliance with covenants under previous
credits 343- and 487-BD, a workable framework of rules and regulations for
TTB's operations and development was established under the Ordinance
(paragraph 4.02) and is now being implemented.  In July 1980, the accounting
function was transferred by GOB from the Controller and Auditor General (CAG)
to TTB. A commercial accounting system is being introduced within TTB
(paragraph 1.30). There are still some areas in TTB's technical and
financial organization which require strengthening. The flow of management
information is at times erratic and not always presented in a way that could
lead to effective control and action. The proposed project includes outside
assistance required to further improve and strengthen TTB's management and
control (paragraphs 4.06 to 4.09).
Staff and Training
4.04      TTB currently employs about 17,250 people, corresponding to 160
staff per 1,000 working DELs. This is a relatively high level, even compared
with many other developing countries. Annex 18 gives TTB's past and current
staff distribution per category and the anticipated distribution at the end
of the SFYP. Under the previous projects, GOB and TTB took some steps to
improve the ratio of staff to telephones which resulted in a reduction by
about 6 percent annually. With the introduction of more sophisticated
systems and more rapid expansion of the total network, TTB, during the
project period, does not anticipate a large expansion in the number of its
staff. It is expected that by July 1985, staff density will be brought down
to about 130 per 1,000 DELs which represents a reduction by some 6 percent
annually.  This is acceptable considering the large proportion of land lines
and of radio and manual equipment, and that about 30 percent of the staff are
engaged in capital construction programs and telegraph services.   Staff



- 25 -
reduction targets were discussed during appraisal and are included in the
performance indicators to be used under the project (paragraph 2.18).
4.05      TTB currently has good training facilities.  There are two
principal telecommunications training centers (TTC) at Dhaka and Khulna which
are designed to provide courses for supervising and engineer level technical
staff either from within TTB or for graduate and diploma level trainees. For
lower level staff, there are five divisional training subcenters (DTC)
providing lower technical and vocational training. In all, some 650 students
can attend courses at a time, and about 16,000 student-weeks of training were
provided during FY81-82. The current program includes continued expansion of
these facilities to meet growing training needs at all levels and in various
technical fields. In particular, a new training center with capacity of 120
students at a time will be established at Bogra with IDA assistance under the
project. Also a telecommunication staff college for senior technical and
management staff is presently being considered for establishment with
UNDP/ITU assistance. The college is expected to become operative by FY85.
All TTB's training facilities were established and are still operated with
the assistance from UNDP/ITU and from the German Government. Adequate
assistance is expected to be continued in future. Details of TTB's existing
and proposed training facilities are given at Annex 18.
Technical Assistance
4.06      TTB and the Government are aware of the managerial and
organizational improvements needed in some important areas of TTB's
operations and of the need to strengthen its development planning and
implementation capabilities. Outside assistance is already provided to TTB,
under a German aid program, for switching and local network planning and
development, and by the UNDP for training. Individual experts are also
periodically advising TTB on other specific matters. However, in order to
assure efficient implementation of the construction program and the operation
and maintenance of the existing and future network, it is necessary that some
complementary technical assistance and staff training be provided to TTB.
4.07      This assistance is included in the proposed project and would
consist in total of about 42 man-months of consultant and experts and 70
man-months of overseas staff training. It will cover the following main
fields: (a) planning and monitoring of program/project; (b) electronic
switching and network design, transition to digital switching techniques,
preparation and evaluation of technical specifications and supervision of
network construction; (c) network design and construction for rural systems;
(d) service quality and traffic engineering; (e) administration, management
and control of radio frequencies; (f) support in the financial and managerial
fields; and (g) related overseas training for TTB staff in the above fields
of assistance and tasks. Details of the services and expertise to be
provided over a period of about two years are given at Annex 9. During
negotiations, terms of reference for this assistance, as discussed during
appraisal, were agreed upon and completed together with a timetable for its
implementation. To enable timely implementation of the project (paragraph
2.15) assurances were obtained that TTB will engage the services of a



- 26 -
switching consultant and of a financial consultant not later than June 30,
1983, both mutually acceptable to TTB and IDA. Draft terms of reference for
both consultants were discussed during appraisal.
Accounting and Budgeting
4.08      TTB's degree of financial autonomy has improved over the past two
years. Funds for TTB and the income generated by it are now placed in a
separate account within the Bank of Bangladesh. TTB prepares annual budget
forecasts and these are presented to its board for review, comment and
approval prior to being forwarded for final approval to the central
government authorities via the Ministry of PT&T. As required, the agreed
budget funds are transferred to the TTB bank account.  It is in this area
that full financial autonomy for TTB is not achieved. Government is in
control of resource allocation to TTB and in this role can determine the size
and scope of expansion. TTB does, however, have the authority to make minor
changes to allocations within the agreed overall budget plan.
4.09      In the past, TTB has prepared its annual financial statements on a
cash reporting basis. A firm of consultants has, over the past two years,
been preparing and providing the training necessary for the introduction of a
commercial accounting system within TTB. It is intended that the two systems
will run in parallel and that commercial accounts will be prepared for FY1982
and thereafter. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that TTB
would, for FY83 and thereafter, prepare commercial financial statements.  In
order to assist in the preparation of these accounts, the analysis of
budgeting methodology (paragraph 4.10) and to establish the basis for a
management information system, TTB needs to employ a financial consultant.
The terms of reference for this consultant were agreed and finalized by TTB
and IDA shortly after appraisal and recruitment action for the consultant is
presently under way. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that, not
later than June 30, 1983, TTB will have engaged the services of a financial
consultant mutually acceptable to TTB and IDA.
4.10      In comparing the last four years' budget documents, it is noted
that there are major differences between budget expectations and actual
results. Many of the discrepancies result from the lack of defined budgeting
methodology, together with an apparent lack of coordination between TTB's
engineering and financial departments. It will be the role of the financial
consultant (paragraph 4.09) and the relevant TTB staff to establish the
outline of an effective budget system and to advise on its implementation.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that by end of June 1984 an
effective budget system would be established and thereafter maintained.
Billing and Collection
4.11      For automatic exchanges, rentals are billed monthly in advance and
call charges are billed monthly after they have been incurred. The billing
system is computerized. At present, the system for preparing and issuing
bills takes about 20 days, and there have been no significant delays beyond
this. Subscribers can pay at any post office, bank or telephone office. The
policy is that, if a subscriber has not paid within 15 days, then a reminder
is sent for payment within seven days; if no payment is made, then the



- 27 -
telephone is disconnected within a further seven days. Accounts receivable
as at June 30, 1980, were Tk 80.0 million, representing about 14 percent of
TTB's total revenues for 1980. This coefficient has been fairly consistent
over the previous four years and is acceptable.
Audit
4.12      TTB has recently created an internal audit section with a staff of
about 15. This staff works from an internal audit manual which covers all
major aspects of accounting procedures and control systems. A Director of
Internal Audit has recently been appointed.
4.13      The Controller Auditor General (CAG-PT&T) is TTB's external
auditor. The audit report of the 1979 accounts was forwarded to IDA about 14
months after the year end. The 1980 audited accounts were forwarded to IDA
about 16 months late. With the introduction of an internal audit, this
timing should improve; however, with the introduction of a commercial
accounting system and presentation of commercial accounts, the efficiency and
timing of both TTB in producing accounts and the CAG in auditing them has
still to be established. The CAG has experience in auditing commercial
accounts and also has the right to hire private external auditors to do
various tasks. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that TTB would
continue to employ independent auditors acceptable to the Association and
that the presentation of draft and audited accounts would conform to the
following timetable with respect to forwarding reports to IDA:
(Month after end of fiscal year)
Fiscal Year         Draft Accounts    Audited Accounts
1983                   9                  12
1984                   7                  10
1985                   5                   8
1986 and after         3                   6
During negotiations, the above timings were discussed and agreed upon to the
extent that, should such timings not be met and, subject to the draft
accounts being provided within the time frame, then CAG would resort to
hiring private external auditors to assist in the audits of TTB.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Financial Performance
5.01      The past financial performance of TTB has been reasonable.  A
summary for the years 1977 to 1981 is given below.

Rate of return on
revalued assets
before interest (%)    12        10      7      14     23
Detail of TTB's historical income statement and balance sheets for FY77 to
FY81 are given in Annexes 19 and 20. TTB's past operating ratios and rates
of return are acceptable. The falling away of these ratios in 1979 was
counteracted by a tariff increase in May 1979 effective for the 1980
financial year. During the period 1977 to 1981, the self-generated cash
contribution as a percent of capital expansion rose from 8 percent to 52
percent and averaged about 30 percent for the whole period.
Present Financial Position
5.02      A summary of TTB's estimated balance sheet as at June 30, 1981, is
shown below:



- 29 -
Tk millions
Assets (Book Value)
Gross Fixed Assets                            1,814.8

Net Fixed Assets                              1,352.9
Plant Under Construction                        695.3
Financial Assets                                 87.6
Current Assets                                  295.0
Total Assets                                2,430.8
Liabilities
Equity Capital                                1,594.9
Profit and Loss Account                         190.1
Total Government Equity                       1,785.0
Long-Term Debt                                  432.0
Current Liabilities                             213.8
Total Liabilities                           2,430.8
Financial assets consist of TTB's investment in the local telecommunications
manufacturing factory. Long-term debt represents the passing on by
Government of IDA project-related funds (paragraph 5.06).
Valuation of Assets
5.03      Updated records on TTB's fixed assets are in the process of being
completed, with completion expected in early 1983. In the meanwhile, plant
accounts are maintained and present asset figures and future projections are
considered to be reasonably accurate.
5.04      In 1977, TTB employed consultants to revalue the gross fixed assets
existing as at June 30, 1976.  This revaluation exercise concluded that the
book value of these assets needed to be increased by about 60 percent to
reflect replacement cost as at June 1976. To reduce possible distortions in
asset values by price inflation on the one hand and declining unit costs of
telecommunications assets from improved technologies on the other, TTB's
total fixed assets in operation have been adjusted on a trial basis to
reflect the current value of the assets, by being revalued from the 1976
revised base by 6 percent per annum.



- 30 -
5.05      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that, not later than
June 30, 1983, TTB would propose and agree with IDA a method for the annual
revaluation of its total fixed assets. Assurances were also obtained that
TTB would review the value of its fixed assets annually thereafter, in
accordance with the methods agreed on with IDA for the purposes of
calculating the rate of return on such assets.
Financing Plan
5.06      The forecast of sources and applications of funds is based upon
TTB's capital expenditure program and is shown in Annex 21. The following is
a summary of the financing for the period 1983 to 1986.
Tk millions   US$ millions

Total Sources                            3,584.0          162.9
TTB has a good net internal cash generation which finances the equivalent of
53 percent of program costs during the project period.
5.07      The medium- and long-term financing identified above is made up as
follows:



- 31 -
Source                         Tk millions   US$ millions
IDA                                  827.2            37.6
KFW                                   118.8            5.4
Japan                                 207.5            9.4
France                                 52.8            2.4
SIDA                                   26.4            1.2
UNDP                                   37.4            1.7
Total foreign sources               1,265.2           57.7
Government                            509.7           22.9
Total                          1,773.0            80.6
Of the above external financing and including the proposed IDA Credit, over
90 percent is confirmed.  The balance of unconfirmed financing represents
requirements for future works and financing which is expected to be secured
either through further bilateral aid or through the use of supplier credits.
Future Financial Performance
5.08      Financial statements for the fiscal years 1982-1986 are given in
Annex 21 through Annex 24. A summary of TTB's expected future financial
performance, assuming cumulative inflation on operating costs of about 11
percent per annum is given below.
Fiscal Years Ending June 30:               1982    1983    1984    1985    1986
Operating revenues (Tk millions)            846    1027    1395    1880    2170
Operating expenses (Tk millions)            476      621     806    1083    1187
Operating surplus (Tk millions)             370      406     589      797      983
Interest expense (Tk millions)              170      225     404      495      604
Net Operating Surplus (Tk millions)    200         181     185      302      379
Operating ratio (%)                          56       60       57      57       55
Rate of return on revalued assets (%)        20       17       19      23       25
TTB's projected financial performance over the project period is good.  The
operating ratio, at 57 percent, and the rates of return are considered
satisfactory.
5.09      Over the five-year period 1982-86 Government will pass on to TTB
both its own and bilateral investment funds, at the same time Government
would also return to TTB its self generated funds.  Government is to charge
TTB an interest of 11.5 percent on all funds provided for capital investment
purposes (including self generated funds returned to TTB). Even if the debt



- 32 -
equity ratio for TTB were to be assessed at 70:30 (a high ratio) then the
interest charged by Government on IDA and Government funding would be
equivalent to over 16 percent. This interest rate is adequate and satisfies
the principle of full cost financing. During negotiations it was agreed that
the annual charge paid to Government on the total equity of TTB would be
increased from present rate of 7 percent to 11.5 percent per annum.
5.10      During negotiations, tariff increases averaging 25 percent were
agreed on. For financial projections purposes, these increases are assumed
to be effective by December 1983. TTB's rate of return on revalued assets
remains acceptable, despite inflation, as does TTB's net internal cash
generation (paragraph 5.06).  This is due to an almost 50 percent increase of
DELs in service during the program period and to an increased utilization of
the services.  The present forec:asts show the annual rate of return on the
estimated revalued net operating assets to be not less than 17 percent before
interest. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that, as from FY84,
TTB would maintain tariffs at a sufficient level to achieve a rate of return
on revalued average net fixed assets of at least 15 percent each year. This
rate of return is adequate to meet TTB's future financial requirements and is
in excess of expected annual inflation over the project period. This
covenant at 15 percent reflects an increase from 10 percent under a similar
covenant in the ongoing IDA telecommunications projects.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      At negotiations, the Government confirmed the agreement reached
between TTB and BTV on tariffs applicable to the use of TTB's facilities for
relaying TV programs. FY83 will be first full year of effective
implementation of BTV's tariffs (paragraph 3.09).
6.02      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that:
(a) financing has been arranged or the Government will make
available to TTB necessary foreign funds required for the
project (paragraph 2.09);
(b)  the proceeds of the proposed credit will be transferred
to TTB, and funds transferred and outstanding would bear
an interest rate of 11.5 percent per annum. The period
of this transfer arrangement would be for 20 years,
including a grace period on capital repayment of five
years (paragraph 2.10);
(c) TTB's annual development budget will be adequate to carry
out the project as planned (paragraph 2.15);
(d) TTB was taking effective action to engage the services of
two key consultants mutually acceptable to TTB and IDA
under the project for (i) switching equipment and (ii)
finances, not later than June 30, 1983 (paragraphs 4.07
and 4.09);



- 33 -
(e) TTB will, for FY83 and thereafter, prepare commercial
financial statements (paragraph 4.09);
(f) an effective budget system will be established and imple-
mented within TTB by June 30, 1984 and thereafter
maintained (paragraph 4.10);
(g) TTB will continue to employ independent auditors
acceptable to IDA. The presentation of draft and audited
accounts would conform to a timetable agreed with IDA
and, if needed to meet the agreed timings, private
external auditors would be hired to assist CAG in the
audits of TTB (paragraph 4.13);
(h) the annual charge paid to Government on the total equity
of TTB including retained earnings will be at a rate of
at least 11.5 percent per annum (paragraph 5.09); and
(i)  TTB's tariffs will, as from FY84, be maintained at a
sufficient level to achieve a rate of return on revalued
average net fixed assets in operation of at least 15
percent each year (paragraph 5.10). For the purpose of
calculating such return, TTB will propose and agree with
IDA not later than June 30, 1983, a method for the annual
revaluation of its total fixed assets and as from FY84
annually revalue its fixed assets in accordance with
method agreed on with IDA (paragraph 5.05); and
(j) an increase by an average of not less than 25 percent of
TTB's current tariffs would be effective by December
31, 1983 at the latest (paragraph 5.10).
6.03       As conditions of credit effectiveness:
(a) GOB would have confirmed that the agreement with Japan
necessary to finance parts of the project would have been
entered into and become effective (paragraph 2.09);
(b) Government would have established and enacted an
administrative order, acceptable to IDA, to transfer to
TTB the proceeds of the proposed IDA credit
[paragraphs 2.10 and 6.02(b)]; and
(c) TTB will have tenders issued, with IDA's approval of
procurement documentation, for procurement of goods
representing at least US$7.0 million under the proposed
credit (paragraph 2.15).
6.04       The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit
to the Government of Bangladesh of US$35 million on standard terms.

P?rojects Objectives and Implementation
6.        In addition to sector expansion, IDA's lending for
telecommunications in Bangladesh stressed the following objectives: (a) to
improve and strengthen sector organization in particular by having a Board
(TTB) established by Government to be responsible for operation, maintenance
and development of public telecommunications services within the country; (b)
to improve TTB's administration and technical methods and procedures to
achieve satisfactory operational and developmental efficiency; and (c) to
improve financial viability of TTB with adequate internal generation to
Einance its own development program.

Page 5 of 5
7.        Several problems attended the implementation of the earlier
projects, more particularly in the fields of institution building and
organization, procurement and physical implementation of the works, timely
availability of funds from Government for local works, and financial
organization and performance. Credit 487-BD included the establishment of
the Telegraph and Telephone Board as a covenant. It required three
successive ordinances in 1975, 1976 and 1979 to have a satisfactory framework
under established rules for TTB's operations and development. Since the end
of 1978, IDA exercised intense supervision through repeated visits during
which action plans were regularly worked out and agreed with TTB and
Government. As a result, TTB accepted to have consultants assisting them to
prepare tender documents and to evaluate offer for complex equipment. Under
IDA's insistence the Government decided in July 1980 to transfer the
accounting function from Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) to TTB and to
progressively introduce a commercial accounting system within TTB.
Consultants were also employed to advise on the introduction of such system
and to train staff in this field.
8.        Since 1980, the pace and conditions of project implementation are
improving. By the end of 1980 all earlier projects had been completed. The
second telecommunications project had met 80% of the original targets, with
most items being completed at the only exception of four trunk and
international exchanges which were ordered in early 1981 for completion in
1983. Steps are also being taken to improve TTB's management and operating
capabilities and to expand staff training. Close supervision could continue
under the second and future projects to assist TTB and to keep
telecommunications development in Bangladesh and the ongoing and future
projects on tracks. The proposed third project would enable such continued
improvement of TTB management, especially in matters related to development
planning and implementation, and financial management and organization.

TELEGRAPH AND TELEPHONE BOARD (TTB)
THIRD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
Physical Works Under the Project
General
1.        The project consists of parts of TTB's investment program which
remain to be committed and implemented during the last three years of the
SFYP. It includes priority new works to rehabilitate and expand the local,
long distance and rural systems for construction from January 1983 to
September 1986. The project covers principally the provision of local
switching and junction facilities for about 14,000 subscriber lines and 3,000
urban junctions in the greater Dhaka network, the rehabilitation and
expansion of underground and overhead local line systems in urban areas for
connection of about 35,000 new subscribers, and the provision of long
distance transmission facilities for about 3,000 automatic and 600 manual
circuits to be added on existing and new links during that period.
Simultaneously, existing services will be improved, sophisticated and
expanded over present local and long distance networks where approximately
100,000 main lines and 1,400 long distance circuits are now in operation.
Service will also be first provided in 10 rural zones covering large isolated
areas of the country, adding about 2,000 new rural subscribers and 80 long
distance PCOs. To this effect small manual exchanges now in service at
locations where automatic exchanges are being installed will be re-used. The
project also covers the construction of technical buildings for switching and
transmission equipment at 24 locations and the establishment of a training
center for technicians in the northern part of the country. Electronic
switching equipment for local service will be introduced on a pilot basis in
a large zone of the greater Dhaka region. The technical assistance required
to further assist TTB in improving its management and organization, in
strengthening its operational and developmental capability and in
project/program planning and implementation is included. The various
physical works and components of the proposed project are detailed below.
Electronic Exchanges and Urban Junction Facilities in Dhaka
2.        To improve service in Dhaka where expansion of the existing local
network and of its traffic handling capacity are limited by the technical
capabilities of the system now in use, and to initiate appropriate change
over to modern electronic technology, one large electronic exchange and
smaller sub-exchange with satellites and concentrators will be installed to
service a selected pilot zone of the greater Dhaka region. The new network
combining modern switching and transmission techniques will be used by TTB as
a basis for network design and development planning in future program. The
scheme will include: (a) a main exchange of initial 8,000 lines capacity



- 49 -                           ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 6
with tandem facilities for about 2,000 inter-exchange junctions in the Dhaka
region; (b) sub-exchange, satellite and concentrator switching facilities at
about 10 separate and somewhat distant locations for initial capacity of
6,000 subscribers with associated junctions facilities; (c) PCM transmission
equipment for about 3,000 urban junctions between existing and new exchanges
in the Dhaka region and in other multi-exchange areas of Bangladesh; and (d)
modern centralized operation and maintenance facilities for the existing and
new local and trunk switching exchanges, as well as for local networks, in
the greater Dhaka. The project provides for the employment of consultants to
advise and assist TTB in system design and choice, detailed planning and
engineering, preparation of specifications, assistance in procurement,
supervision of installation acceptance and start-up of operation and
maintenance, for all IDA-financed works under this important item.
Manual Exchanges
3.        The project also provides for the rehabilitation and re-use of the
manual exchanges and switchboards serving villages and isolated growth
centers in the country at places where long distance rural facilities will be
installed. The manual switchboards released with the progressive replacement
by small automatic exchanges under the ongoing part of TTB program will be
improved and rehabilitated in TTB's workshops and reallocated to centers
needing expansion or to new sites. About 3,000 manual exchange lines are
planned to be reinstalled at approximately 50 locations over the project
period. The total capacity of manual systems in service is not expected to
significantly decrease during this period.
Local Cable Networks Replacement and Expansion
4.        This item includes the rehabilitation and expansion of local cable
and overhead line subscriber networks and outside plants principally in the
Dhaka, Chittagong and Khulna multi-exchange areas and in 20 other urban areas
of the country. Switching facilities totaling more than 20,000 lines are
available in these areas and about 14,000 new lines in electronic exchanges
will be installed in Dhaka under the project (paragraph 2 above). The local
line networks require urgent rehabilitation and expansion in these cities to
enable accelerated connection of new subscribers. This represents works for
about 70,000 distributed pairs at primary and secondary levels of the
networks and interexchange junctions as necessary to enable immediate and
future connection of up to about 35,000 new subscribers and for improving
flow of traffic between exchanges. Also, large parts of the local cable and
junction networks in the divisional cities of Dhaka, Chittagong, and Khulna
are worn out or obsolete and need rehabilitation or replacement.
Corresponding works are included in the project, together with the
introduction of new digital PCM technique, in particular for inter-exchange
junction and subscriber line distribution where the network configuration
justifies it. TTB is assisted by a team of expert under bilateral German aid
program in planning and implementing the local cable networks. Used cables
and network equipment, and the techniques for construction of the ducts and
outside plants, are of proven and standard types. Most materials are



- 50 -                          ANNEX 9
Page 3 of 6
procured or manufactured in Bangladesh. Important civil works for cable
ducts, cable laying and jointing and testing of the local distribution
networks are made with the help of local contractors. TTB's own construction
staff realizes the smaller or less urgent networks.
5.        IDA financing under this item would cover part of the local cost of
civil works contracts for duct construction and cable laying and jointing in
trenches, and of contracts for procurement of material such as cement, steel
supporting structures, plastic pipes and miscellaneous goods used for
construction of the networks in the distribution areas of six large exchanges
totaling 25,000 lines in Dhaka, Chittagong and Khulna and of 20 smaller
exchanges totaling about 8,000 lines in the following provincial towns:
Jamalpur and Jhenaidah (600 lines each); and Bagerhat, Perojpur, Sreemangal,
Bhola, Kishoreganj, Nilpahmari, Joypurhat, Nawabganj, Rajbari, Chuadanga,
Netrokona, Jhalakati, Magura, Meherpur, Manikganj, Satkhira and Mirkadim (400
lines each). These works are scattered throughout the country and of
estimated contract size of less than US$0.5 million which is not likely to
interest foreign bidders. Corresponding contracts procured through local
competitive bidding would be financed by IDA up to 80 percent of their cost,
representing the estimated cost net of taxes of such contract and totaling
about US$4.2 million of the base cost for this item.
Subscriber Installations
6.        The project provides for the required subscriber installations
including telephone instruments and subscribers wiring for about 35,000
telephone stations of all kinds to be added at the above locations
(paragraphs 3 and 4) during the project period. Most of the equipment,
including small sizes PABXs, will be manufactured in Bangladesh by TSS and
installed by TTB. The new 16,000 lines pilot local network in Dhaka using
electronic exchanges would include push button telephone sets for some of the
subscribers. These sets would be IDA-financed.
Long Distance and Transmission Systems (Domestic and International)
7.        The project provides for the supply and installation of long
distance transmission systems including one 960 channel capacity microwave
link on the backbone route Dhaka-Chittagong and multiplexing equipment for
about 2,800 additional channels on existing and new microwave and coaxial
links. The main microwave link Dhaka-Chittagong is in service since more
than 10 years and had been partly damaged during its installation. TTB will
replace and expand this link under a bilateral credit from Japan. The new
link will include three broadband RF channels, one being for 960 telephone
channels, one for relaying TV programs and the third one as a stand-by to
ensure permanent service on the two other channels. This compares with the
present situation where TV programs are relayed on the stand-by equipment for
telephone channels on such a major route. All the interurban transmission
facilities representing the addition of about 3,600 trunk channels under the
project are between exchanges where trunk switching equipment for automatic
traffic at regional, national and international levels will be available by
1984. Facilities for this nationwide dialing service (NWD) are now being



- 51 -                             ANNEX 9
Page 4 of 6
provided under Credit 487-BD with the installation of four national trunk and
one international automatic exchanges with capacities of about 4,000 national
long distance and 400 international circuits. At present interurban traffic
is routed on about 1,400 trunk circuits, of which 900 are manual and 500
automatic on 20 city to city STD relations. International service is
entirely manual or operator dialed with a small number of countries, on 50
czircuits linking Bangladesh with 14 other countries. The links and equipment
to be provided under the project will highly improve traffic capability and
sophistication, as well as overall service quality, of TTB's national and
international telephone networks.
International
8.         The project provides for the supply and installation of four
additional receivers and associated equipment at the satellite earth station
of Bethunia to enable expansion of Bangladesh international telephone and
telex services using facilities from the INTELSAT V satellite. IDA would
finance the foreign cost of this item.
Long Distance Rural Telephone
9.         TTB's program aims at expanding rural telephone throughout the
country. From FY81 to FY85 it is planned that the share of rural telephone
would approximately increase from 6 to 10 percent of the total telephones,
particular attention being given to expanding service coverage. Based on its
previous experience, TTB will mostly use multi-access and single channel VHF
rural systems for public call offices (PCOs) and telephone subscribers in the
newly serviced areas. Small automatic telephone exchanges or manual
switchboard of up to about 100 lines capacity will be used for local
subscribers where demand justifies it (paragraph 3 above). The proposed
project includes an important item for such expansion. Construction will
take place from 1983 to 1985 and IDA financing would cover supply and
installation of the following: 16 multi-access VHF base stations and 80 long
distance PCOs; and transmission links to the main network and to some distant
]'COs and isolated subscribers including 20 UHF systems with 6 and 24 channel
capacity. Details of the proposed locations for the base stations, the
coverage of the systems and a representative arrangement of the new rural
networks is given in the attached Map No. IBRD 15927. This part of project
would provide connection facilities for about 2,600 new rural subscribers and
90 distant PCOs in total. The map shows that outlaying subscribers could be
reached on extended parts of the country.
Buildings, Training Center and Miscellaneous Equipment
10.        Buildings.  The project includes the construction of technical
buildings for large telephone exchanges and for combined telephone exchanges
and transmission centers at 24 locations as follows:
(a) exchange buildings at: Dhaka (4 exchanges, totaling 57,000
sq.ft.); Chittagong (2 exchanges, totaling 22,000 sq.ft.); Khulna
(1 exchange, 32,000 sq.ft.); Narayangonj (1 exchange, 7,000



-52 -                            ANNEX 9
Page 5 of 6
sq.ft.); Zinjira, Chandpur and Kalurghat (1 exchange, 4,000 sq.ft.
each); Comilla, Siddirgonj, Nabigonj and Savar (1 exchange, 3,000
sq.ft. each); and
(b) telecommunications buildings at: Mirkadim, Tangail, Habigonj and
Sunamgonj (1 building, 7,000 sq.ft. each); Manikgonj and Jhenaidah
(1 building, 4,000 sq.ft. each); and Meherpur, Narail and
Lakshimpur (1 building, 3,000 sq.ft. each).
These buildings are scattered throughout the country with estimated contract
size of less than US$0.5 million each and are not likely to interest foreign
bidders. Corresponding contracts would be procured through local competitive
bidding. IDA would finance up to 80 percent of their cost, representing the
estimated cost net of taxes of such contracts and totaling about US$3.2
million base cost.
11.       Training Center at Bogra. The project includes the construction
and equipment of a small regional telecommunications training center at Bogra
for about 120 trainees in telephone and telegraph at technician level. IDA
would finance up to 80 percent of the local cost of the technical building of
the center totaling about US$0.5 million and about US$0.4 million of imported
training equipment procured through ICB.
12.       Miscellaneous Equipment.  Miscellaneous equipment for buildings is
also included to improve and strengthen TTB's capability in implementing the
project works with its own construction staff, to assist in operation and
maintenance of the new installations in particular with regard to traffic
analysis and service quality measuring and testing, and to train staff. This
equipment essentially consists of: (a) air conditioning, power supply,
elevators, and miscellaneous building equipment for material handling and
installation; (b) handling equipment for cables as well as tools and
machinery for local network construction; (c) cable laying, jointing and
testing equipment; (d) measuring and testing equipment; and (f) training aids
on new systems for use in service and at training centers. All items are
IDA-financed and will be grouped in appropriate bidding packages and procured
by ICB.
Technical Assistance and Training
13.       Technical assistance consists of about 42 manmonths of consultant
and expert services, and of 70 manmonths training services for senior
management and professional staff of TTB and of PT&T planning unit to attend
appropriate overseas courses, fellowships and seminars. This assistance
financed by IDA under the project will be in addition to the aid already
available to TTB from various bilateral sources for development of the local
switching and cable networks, and from the ITU for training. TTB will be
provided with the following services and expertise over a period of
approximately two years:
(a) advising on management and administration of the
planning and monitoring of program/project

Return on Investment
1.        The benefit period of the program extends from 1981-2001, when on
average the equipment provided under the program is expected to have
substantially completed its useful life.
2.        Capital expenditures are based on the estimated requirements during
the program period, excluding preinvestments for future programs. Asset
values have been adjusted to reflect 1982 values.
3.        Incremental revenues assigned to the program are primarily based on
the expected additional telephone and telex subscribers and the traffic
increase brought about by the program.  Incremental costs excluding
depreciation and interest are based on the additional assets, traffic and
staff requirements expected from the program. All revenues and costs have
been deflated to bring them to their comparable 1982 price levels.
4.        A summary of the program's incremental cost and benefits stream at
1982 price levels is as follows (in Tk millions):
Year              Costs               Benefits      Net Benefits
1982                900                    -             (900)
1983                587                  273             (314)
1984                778                  500             (278)
1985              1,005                  824             (181)
1986                357                  948              591
1987                357                1,050             693
5.        The internal rate of return for the above benefit stream is 26%.
6.        Applying a standard conversion factor of 0.83, a minimum estimate
of the economic rate of return is 24%. Labor has not been shadow priced as
TTB mostly employs skilled staff of which there is no surplus in Bangladesh.
7.        A sensitivity analysis on the financial rate of return shows that,
with 10% higher capital costs and 10% lower revenues, the rate of return will
be 20%.

Partial Direct Cost Savings Resulting from
Single Telephone Installations at Two Factories
1.        In early 1980 one radio telephone each was installed at the Nabaran
Jute Mill (NJM) and the Ghorasal Fertilizer Factory (GFF) outside of Dhaka.
The two telephones are linked directly to a central telephone exchange in
Dhaka. Data on both telephone usage (SAR paragraphs 1.13 and 1.14) and on
some limited direct cost savings were gathered through interviews with the
general managers and several senior staff of both enterprises. While
considered indicative, these data were not subject to confirmation through
independent sample observation.

Average number of working hours/week                                  42     42
2.        Given these data, before and after differences in direct
expenditures on gasoline consumed on trips to Dhaka for message
communication, and on differences in expenditures on management staff wages
for travel time for message communication with Dhaka for a period of one year
are as follows:

NJM        GFF
Gasoline expenditure savings (Taka)                          268,800    296,400
Reduced wage expenditure for transport
communication for two management staff (Taka)               36,557     39,197
Total yearly expenditure difference (Taka)             305,357    335,597
These before and after expenditure differences include only estimates of the
limited message-related direct cost savings relating to gasoline and
transport time-related management wages. A more complete calculation would
include savings in vehicle capital, other operating, and maintenance costs,
and other direct and indirect expenditure differences (paragraph 5).
Cost of Telephone Service
3.        The capital cost of one VHF radio telephone installed in each
factory plus a proportionate share of the base station cost of the receiver/
transmitter at a central exchange in Dhaka is roughly Tk 190,000. Each
factory reimburses TTB for this cost. Installation cost is about Tk 10,000
and yearly maintenance cost beginning after one year of operation is assumed
to be Tk 20,000 per year. These costs are also reimbursed by the factories
to TTB. Assuming 96 outgoing telephone calls each week charged at Tk 0.75
per call (roughly reflecting TTB operating cost), telephone operation costs
to the factories (and TTB) average about Tk 3,456 per year (a similar number
of telephone calls are received by each factory each week with the Tk 0.75
call charge being paid by the caller). Additional capacity costs incurred by
the network as a whole as a result of the two additional telephone
connections are assumed to be trivial.
Telephone vs. Direct Transport Communication Expenditures
4.        The cost of telephone service to each factory during the first year
of operation is approximately Tk 203,456. The quantified direct
communication expenditure savings by NJM and GFF is Tk 305,357 and Tk 335,597
per year respectively: the quantified first year direct communication
expenditure savings exceed costs by about 1.5 times at NJM and 1.6 times at
GFF. During the second and each succeeding year following telephone
installation, quantified direct savings exceed costs (Tk 23,456) by about 13
times at NJM and 14 times at GFF. Since costs do not exceed benefits in any
year, the internal rate of return on the telephone links between the two
factories and Dhaka is infinite. Such a return is probably not uncommon in
such circumstances in Bangladesh, and is one reason for the large number of
private VHF and HF systems which are licensed by TTB in instances in which



- 64 -               ANNEX 16
Page 3 of 3
TTB is unable to provide adequate public telephone service (SAR paragraph
1.03). From the point of view of the country as a whole the gasoline savings
is a savings in foreign exchange..
The Unquantified Benefits
5.        The above calculations do not reflect what managers at both
factories considered to be the most prominent benefits of the new telephone
links to Dhaka. They cited two major benefits: (a) more timely information
and two-way interaction with the headquarters offices in Dhaka and with
suppliers which enabled greater efficiency in factory management and
scheduling--the trips to Dhaka for day-to-day message communication purposes
prior to the installation of the telephones were less than satisfactory since
they entailed delays and tended to generate partial information which raised
additional questions for senior management at the factories and for message
recipients in Dhaka, and on occasion increased uncertainty; and (b)
significant improvements in the coordination of transport for both supplies
and spares going into the factories and for the shipping of jute and
fertilizer from the factories--both factories have limited warehousing and
storage facilities, hence to prevent factory stoppages a large network of
barge, railroad, and truck facilities must be coordinated and monitored by
the factories and their front offices in Dhaka on a day-to-day basis.

THIRD TELECOMMUINICATIONS PROJECT
Telecommunication Staff and their Training
Staff
1.        At the end of June 1981, TTB had 16,665 employees.  Their past and
present dispersion, as at the end of June 1973 and 1981 respectively, and
anticipated numbers as at June 30, 1985, at the end of the program period are
as follows:
Numbers as at the end of Fiscal Year

laborers                           2,000        3,627        3,630
Other staff (unskilled) for
general services, main-
tenance and construction           3,069        2,227        2,300
Total                          13,007       17,254       18,200
Staff per 1,000 DELs                    245          158          130
2.        Against the anticipated growth in working DELs at an average rate
of 9% per annum under the program, the staff growth has been forecast at a
much lower rate of under 4%. This is possible because of the extended
automatization of the local and long distance telephone services. Staff
level will be reduced from the present 160 to about 130 staff per 1,000 DELs
at the end of the project period.

3.        In spite of such a reduction, staff level at the end of current
program will still be very high, even compared to other developing countries
whose figures range from 20 to 100. TTB's staff, however, includes personnel
engaged in telegraph services and in construction and development,
representing about 5% and 25% of the staff respectively. This improves,
relatively, the level of TTB's staff employed in operation and maintenance.
Also TTB is constrained from making further drastic reduction in its intake
proportionate to system expansion by the government directives to minimize
employment in order to overcome the present critical unemployment situation
in the country. Finally, the anticipated level of 130 staff per 1,000 DELs
by July 1985 compares with past level of 245 in June 1973 at the beginning of
the previous plan period. This shows the continued efforts made by TTB to
improve staff productivity in the prevailing conditions of its operations and
development.
Training
4.        TTB has at present two telecommunications training centers (TTC) at
Dhaka and Khulna, and five divisional training sub-centers (DTC) at Dhaka,
Chittagong, Barisal, Jessore and Rajshahi. At independence, there was only
one regional training center in Dhaka and four smaller divisional centers for
lower level staff. Total capacity was about 150 trainees altogether.
Building-up of adequate training facilities for telecommunications was
considered and implemented on a priority basis since 1973. Existing centers
can now accommodate up to 650 trainees at a time and are still being
developed. Training facilities are available as follows.
5.        The TTCs train officers, assistant engineers, engineering
supervisors and technicians. While Dhaka TTC concentrates on training for
itransmission equipment and of telegraphists and teleprinter operators, the
Khulna TTC concentrates on switching equipment. Their present total training
capacities are 14,000 and 8,000 student-weeks per year; at a time some 320
and 200 staff can be trained respectively. During FY80-81 these capacities
were used at about 65% and usage is being increased each year to meet the
growing training requirements which are estimated to be covered by the two
centers until about the end of 1983. In addition, two more TTCs each with a
c:apacity of 200 trainees at a time are proposed at Chittagong and Bogra to
meet further requirement from the end of the current program on. The Dhaka
TTC was established from 1976 to 1979 under a UNDP/ITU project providing for
aL team of up to seven experts under a project director from ITU, assisted at
aLll levels by counterparts from TTB. Training started in FY77-78 and is now
under TTB management with the continued assistance of some ITU experts in
specific fields. The Khulna TTC was established with the aid of the German
Government. It was completed in 1979 and three German experts are still
working in the center. During the program period it is proposed to establish
a new TTC at Bogra with capacity of 150 trainees at a time. The technical
building and part of the equipment for this center will be financed by IDA

under the proposed project. The Bogra telecenter is planned to be
operational by 1985 and would specialize in training for telecommunications
mechanics and technicians in the regular courses and for refresher courses
for all other cadres of the Northern Division. The start-up of the courses,
based on the experience acquired in the Dhaka and Khulna TTCs, will be
assisted under the continued UNDP/ITU project for Telecommunications in
Bangladesh.
6.        A telecommunications staff college (TSC) is also to be established
with UNDP assistance. ITU will provide the necessary technical expertise.
The TSC is designed to cater the training needs for senior technical and
management staff from assistant divisional and divisional engineers level and
above, as well as other higher categories of telecommunication officers and
managers. Its curriculum will include a course on organization and financial
management in a telecommunication entity. As in other TTB's training
centers, trainees from outside governmental or private organizations
operating telecommunication services, such as railways, defence, inland water
transportation, civil aviation, etc., will have access to TSC. Planned
capacity of the center is initially for 100 students, expandable to 200. The
project is being discussed between GOB, TTB and the UNDP. It is envisaged
that TSC would become operational by FY85. Until that time, the Dhaka
telecenter will continue to organize and conduct specialized seminars and
courses as started since 1979 for a limited number of TTB senior staff and
officers.
7.        For the lower grade staff, there are five divisional
telecommunication training subcenters (DTC), where telephone operators,
mechanics, linemen and cable jointers are trained. These centers were
established with aid from the German Government. Each has a capacity of 24
trainees at a time representing about 6,000 student-weeks of effective
training per annum. Capacity was used at about 60% during FY81 and usage is
gradually expanded by TTB. To meet future needs at this level, it is planned
to reach a level of 10,000 student-weeks per annum which is considered
adequate.

annum for the period 1981-86. These compare with an historical growth rate
of about 12%.
3.        Tariff increases averaging 25 percent are assumed to be effective
by December 31, 1983.

transfers to fixed assets.
12.       Accounts receivable has been projected at about 16% of gross
revenues for each year.
13.       Inventory based upon historical analysis has been projected at 9%
of average gross fixed assets.
14.       Government account represents government investment in TTB as well
as the passing on of various bilateral donor grants and loans.
15.       Current liabilities represents amounts outstanding on construction
program and interest due but not paid.

funds under existing IDA credits 343-BD and 487-BD and funds under the
proposed project.
