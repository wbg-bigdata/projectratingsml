IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA
TRANSPORT PROJECT
(LOAN NO.3593-RO)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Transport Project in
Romania, for which loan 3593-RO in the amount of US$ 120 million equivalent was
approved on April 30, 1993 and made effective on September 7, 1993.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1998, which is the original closing date
provided in the Loan Agreement. It was fully disbursed, and the last disbursement took
place on January 5, 1999. Cofinancing for the project was provided by EBRD, EIB, EU-
PHARE, and the Romanian Government.
The first draft of the ICR was prepared by Anca Dumitrescu of the ECCRO and
reviewed by Enn Vasur, Romania Transport Program Team Leader, and Sven-Ake
Blomberg, Highway Engineer, ECSIN. The borrower has provided comments and inputs
that are incorporated into the report.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision/completion
mission of November 23 - December 1, 1998. It is based on material in the project file.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA
EVALUATION SUMMARY
TRANSPORT PROJECT
Loan No. 3593-RO
Introduction
1.    The Bank had financed two projects in the transport sector before 1990, the
Danube-Black Sea Canal project (Ln. 1794-RO), and the Land Transport Project
(Ln. 2034-RO). After the December 1989 violent overthrow of the communist regime,
Romania resumed relations with the World Bank early in 1990. The reform of the
Transport Sector in Romania began to be considered by the Bank in 1991, when an
IBRD-EBRD joint team came to assess the situation in the sector. Studies for road user
charges, railway restructuring, and urban transport were financed under the TACI Project
(Ln. 3363-RO), and provided background for Bank involvement in the sector. The first
Transport Project and loan to Romania materialized in 1993, and it was the fifth loan
extended to Romania after 1990. The Second Roads Project (Ln. 4178-RO) and the
Railways Project (Ln. 3976-RO), respectively, have been subsequently developed to
follow-up the programs in related transport sub-sectors.
Project Objectives
2.    In support of the GOR strategy in the transport sector, oriented toward European
integration, the project objectives were to: (a) increase efficiency of the sector and
accommodate expected changes in transport demand by improving the condition of the
road network. (b) promote the selection of transport investments on the basis of economic
criteria; (c) improve fiscal performance and reduce the uneconomic use of transport and
energy by implementing a cost-based system of road user charges; (d) develop the
execution of road works by contract; (e) build on transport policy initiatives under the
TACI project particularly with regard to investment selection and restructuring of the
railways; and (f) support the economic reform program and encourage social stability by
financing geographically dispersed works, thereby promoting employment and providing
opportunities for the engagement of recently formed contractors.
3.    To promote achievement of its objectives, the project included the following
components: (a) rehabilitation of about 1,000 km. of national roads; (b) improvement of
border posts; (c) material and equipment for road safety, road maintenance, vehicle
inspection and training; (d) technical assistance and training for the road sub-sector; and
(e) urgently needed track maintenance and data processing equipment, spare parts and
training for the railways.



iii
4.    The objectives and strategy supported by the project were agreed between the
Ministries of Finance and Transport, and the Bank and other donors, EBRD, EIB and
EIJ-PHARE. It was agreed that the Bank would review with the Romanian authorities,
each year starting with 1993, the total road expenditure for the following year, to assess
availability of counterpart funding. It was also agreed that GOR would implement: (a) the
action plans for a revised road user charges system and a system of axle load control; (b)
a time phased plan for shifting selected maintenance activities from force account to
contract; (c) better management practices; and (d) a plan to improve road safety.
Regarding railways, it was agreed that the restructuring study under the TACI project
would address the respective obligations and responsibilities of the GOR and the railways
for railways operations, and define their future role in the transport sector, while the
project would finance urgent track maintenance items and data procession, essential
under any restructuring scenario.
Implementation Experience and Results
5.  The project successfully achieved most of its major objectives, despite the fact that it
was prepared and implemented in an economy in transition, and was challenged by
different degrees of commitment from various Governments' agencies to stabilize the
economy and apply structural reforms. It should be added that the project developed under
a changing economic environment, and the implementing agencies (National
Administration of Roads - AND; National Railways Company - SNCFR; and Romanian
Automobile Register - RAR) had initially little, if at all, experience with Bank financed
projects.
6.  Condition of the national road network was improved significantly through the
rehabilitation of 924 km. of roads, during a period of traffic increase. All national roads
rehabilitated under the project are included in the "Trans-European Corridors" 4 and 9,
meeting thus a priority objective and prerequisite for integration with EU, namely
"ensuring the necessary infrastructure for road users and the integration in the Trans-
European Corridors". Investments were based on economic criteria, the ERR of
rehabilitated network varies between 23% and 54%. The action plan developed for road
user charges, ensuring that revenues from the various road users cover their share of the full
economic cost of building and maintaining the road network, was completed and exceeded;
it culminated with the establishment of a Road Fund (legislation passed in 1996) supported
by the project. Construction and maintenance of road works by contract has evolved from
an insignificant level in 1992 (almost all construction, maintenance and reception was
"integrated" within AND) to 100% for construction, 25% - 96% for various routine
maintenance activities, and 100% for periodic maintenance, in 1998. The first Transport
Project was the starting point for the development of a strong domestic construction
industry, 900/o privatized, and competitive internationally, which provides employment for
over 380,000 workers in the sector. The vehicle inspection lines equipment for the
Romanian Automobile Register (RAR) enabled alignment of Romanian legislation to that
of EU for periodical inspection and control of vehicle emissions. The railways' track
equipment procured under the project was critically needed for the "survival" stage of the
company, and increased productivity by 50%.

7.  The project benefited from full commitment of GOR, particularly the Ministry of
Transport, and of the three implementing agencies. Its sustainability is also supported by
the two projects which followed: the Second Roads Project (Ln. 4178-RO) dedicated to the
road sub-sector; and the Railways Rehabilitation Project (Ln. 3976-RO) dedicated to the
railways sub-sector. Discussions on preparation of the two follow-up projects started
during implementation of the first Transport Project, and they have both expanded the
policy goals and activities of the project.
8.  Total estimated project cost in the Staff Appraisal Report was US$ 405 million
equivalent, of which the Bank would finance US$ 120 million, EBRD and EIB US$ 80
million each, and GOR US$ 125 million with subsequent EU-PHARE financing of about
US$ 24 million equivalent substituting for GOR counterpart funding. Actual costs
amounted to US$ 453.9 million equivalent, which includes additional local costs incurred
by AND during project life (increase in VAT, land acquisition taxes, other fees). The Bank
loan was extended to three beneficiaries: AND (US$ 96 million); SNCFR (US$ 20,00
million); and RAR (US$ 4 million).
9.  The project financed 14 civil works contracts for road rehabilitation, for a total cost of
US$ 380.34 million for a length of 924.2 km, compared to the estimate of US$ 269.32
million for 1053.0 km. One contract on DN5, toward the Giurgiu border crossing, was
added in 1995 (approved by IBRD in 1994). All contracts were completed by the Closing
Date. The original costs of contracts were higher than expected due to the following main
factors: (a) failings in the original detailed design, which proved to be not quite adequate
once construction started. The lack of any road maintenance during the previous years
combined with a strong traffic increase after 1992 had led to a higher deterioration of
roads than anticipated, which was in turn reflected in higher construction costs; (b)
execution of additional retaining structures requested by AND in difficult mountain areas,
and upgraded standards of some roads; (c) VAT increase from 18% to 22% during project
implementation. The Bank therefore approved an additional amount of US$ 16.2 million
from the proceeds of the Second Roads Project (Ln. 4178-RO) to complete the funding of
the works in this project. The project also financed a number of equipment contracts for
AND, SNCFR, and RAR.
10. The cost estimated for road upgrading varied between US$ 375,000 and US$ 600,000
per km in the SAR, compared with a cost at project closing between US$ 400,000 and US$
985,000, based on costs for completed contracts. The economic rate of return (ERR)
calculated over an assumed 15 years service life, ranged from 23% to 66% at appraisal, for
the 13 contracts of roads rehabilitation originally included; on the basis of completion cost
of contracts, the actual ERR varies between 23% and 54%, which is still high.
11. There were no delays in the procurement process; preparation of bidding documents
started early during project preparation, so that many of them were agreed upon at
negotiation. Implementation went well, and disbursement were ahead the schedule during
project life. Loan and project covenants were fully complied with, except for the axle load
control action plan, which was only partially achieved (the relevant covenant was
subsequently revised under the Second Roads Project). Project reports and audits were



v
submitted on time and in good order, and project administration was excellent. All three
sub-.borrowers were GOR agencies ("regies autonomes ') and ensured a smooth
implementation for their components. There were no problems of counterpart funding
availability. Bank performance was generally satisfactory, although there were some delays
in reviewing bidding documents, and processing applications for disbursements and
replenishment of Special Account.
12.   The loan provided for an amount of US$ 20 million equivalent to finance the
supply of rail track maintenance machines, hard-and soft-ware or updating Railways MIS,
as well as a small training program, under a Project Agreement between the Bank and
SNCFR. This component was successfully completed with all funds committed two years
ago. A cost overrun on the supply of track maintenance machines due to the appreciation
of the Austrian Shilling during the manufacturing period was met by "borrowing" about $1
million from AND's loan funds, which amount was fully repaid by SNCFR and borne from
its own budget. The eight track maintenance machines have been operating since 1996,
and have increased productivity by 50%.
13.     The RAR component included procurement of equipment for periodic vehicle
inspection for an amount of US$ 4 million. This component was completed with an
already improved quality and capacity of vehicle inspections. The new modem equipment
consisting of 41 vehicle inspection lines (one for each county in Romania) helped
developed more efficient vehicle inspections for traffic safety and admitted level of
pollution. Both capacity and quality of inspection have improved significantly by using the
new equipment. The number of inspections increased from less than 200,000 in 1995 to
287,400 in 1996 and 312,100 in 1997. The inspections also revealed the technical situation
of the vehicle fleet in Romania; in 1998, only 27% of inspected vehicles were in
compliance with Romanian minimum traffic safety requirements; 23% were below the
admitted level of emissions; and only 9% were fully in compliance with all technical,
safety and pollution standards.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Key Lessons Learned
14.   The overall project outcome is rated satisfactory. The project is also considered
sustainable, with a consistent follow-up on its actions and policies by the two transport sub-
sector projects (roads and railways), currently under satisfactory implementation. All
implementing agencies are competent and dedicated organizations with experience in
carrying out road and rail activities; they are currently being reorganized and restructured,
aiming at achieving a more commercial orientation, suited to a market economy.



vi
15.   Some lessons that can be learned, which have been already carefully taken into
consideration for the follow-up transport operations currently under implementation, are:
(a)    Particular attention should be given to the quality and adequacy of detailed design
with as little time delay as possible between design and the execution of works.
(b)    An inappropriate original price adjustment formula, particularly relevant to the
prevailing high inflation market environment, caused some delays in contractors payment,
and attracted penalties. This suggests that such matters need to receive closer scrutiny at
the time of preparation and negotiations.



IMPLEMENTATION C'OMPLETION REPORT
ROMANIA
TRANSPORT PROJECT (Loan 3593-RO)
Part I. Project Implementation Assessment
A. Evaluation of Objectives
1.   Since 1990, the Government of Romania has and started implementation of reform
measures designed to establish an efficient market economy; 1990 was also the first year
of the post-communist regime, when Romania resumed relations with the World Bank.
Transport is a crucial sector for the economic development of Romania, and its
integration into the European Union; an efficient transport system and particularly
improved roads and road transport are essential to support the structural reforms of the
economy and the emerging private firms. Until 1990, the transport system had relied
primarily on the railways, which had a well developed network of 11,000 km. The road
network totaled 73,000 km, of which 20% were national roads carrying 60% of the
traffic. However, the road sector received less than 10% of total investments in transport
over the seventies and eighties, and rehabilitation lagged behind the needs. At the same
time, private car traffic has increased significantly in the last years, and road transport is
expected to grow faster than other modes.
2.   Early after 1990, major changes took place in the transport institutions, starting
with reorganization of the Ministry of Transport (MOT), to enable it to concentrate on
policy making and regulation function rather than on transport operations. The railways,
highways and ports became "regies automomes" (RA) while road transport departments,
construction departments, and design or research institutes became respectively transport
companies, contractors and commercial companies (CC). All CCs have been, or are on
their way, to become, privatized.
3.   The Government of Romania (GOR) decided that the transport sector required a
major transformation, and had an important role to play in the economic reform process.
It therefore took important steps to rationalize investments and increase the market
orientation of the transport sector by increasing tariffs, setting fuel prices at world market
level, stopping uneconomic investments, beginning commercialization of transport
services and starting a new system of road user charges. At the same time, GOR
recognized that a priority measure, and prerequisite to achieving the conditions for the
EU integration, is ensuring the necessary infrastructure for road and rail users and the
integration in the Trans-European Corridors. The Transport Project financed by the Bank,
and co-financed by GOR, EBRD, EIB, and EU-PHARE, was the first big investment in
the sector after at least two decades of neglect, with slowly increasing budget allocations
from 1993 (US$ 75 million) to 1996 (US$ 1 10 million), and further increases thereafter.
4.   The Bank had financed two projects in the transport sector before 1990, namely the
Danube-Black Sea Canal project (Ln. 1 794-RO), and the Land Transport Project



2
(Ln. 2034-RO). The process of assisting the reform of the Romanian transport sector after
1990 started with studies on railways restructuring and road user charges, financed under
the TACI Project (Ln. 3363-RO). A port master plan study for Constanta, financed by the
Netherlands, started in 1992. The Transport Project was designed as a starting point for a
more comprehensive assistance to the sector, and it therefore addressed critical needs of
both the roads and railways sub-sectors. GOR, through its Ministry of Finance, was the
Borrower, with three RAs as project beneficiaries and implementing agencies: National
Ad,ministration of Roads (AND), National Railways Company (SNCFR), and Romanian
Automobile Register (RAR). It was subsequently followed-up by specific projects for
each sub-sector through the Second Roads (Ln. 4178-RO) and Railways (Ln. 3976)
projects, respectively, both currently under satisfactory implementation.
5.   With this background in mind, the project objectives were to: (a) increase
efficiency of the sector and accommodate expected changes in transport demand by
improving the condition of the road network. (b) promote the selection of transport
investments on the basis of economic criteria; (c) improve fiscal performance and reduce
the uneconomic use of transport and energy by implementing a cost-based system of road
.ser charges; (d) develop the execution of road works by contract; (e) build on transport
Dolicy initiatives under the TACI project particularly with regard to investment selection
and restructuring of the railways; and (i) support the economic reform program and
encourage social stability by financing geographically dispersed works in order to
promote employment generation, also providing business opportunities to the newly
privatized contracting companies to the extent possible. All civil works financed by the
project were to be done by contract. Under competitive bidding, they could provide
opportunities for local contractors to develop, and would create jobs. A program to
graclually shift maintenance work from force account to contract was agreed with AND.
Also, assistance to project management and supervision by consultants was to provide
better practices for AND.
6.   The project objectives were to be met through the following components: (a)
rehabilitation of about 1,000 km. of national roads; (b) improvement of border posts; (c)
material and equipment for road safety, road maintenance, vehicle inspection and
trairing; (d) technical assistance and training for the road sub-sector; and (e) urgently
neecied track maintenance and data processing equipment, spare parts and training for the
railways.
7.  It was agreed that GOR would implement: (a) a revised road user charges system
upon completion of the study financed under TACI Project; (b) a system of axle load
control according to an agreed action plan; (c) a time phased plan for shifting selected
maintenance activities from force account to contract; (d) better management practices;
and (e) a plan to improve road safety. Regarding railways, it was agreed that the
restructuring study under the TACI project would address the respective obligations and
responsibilities of the GOR and the railways for railways operations, and define their
future role in the transport sector, while the project would finance urgent track
maintenance items and data procession, essential under any restructuring scenario.
8.   GOR was fully committed to project objectives, as were the implementing
agencies, and the objectives were fully in line with the Romanian reform program



3
supported by the Bank through its Country Assistance Strategy. These objectives were
realistic in terms of Borrower's capabilities. There were low risks associated with the
project, even in the event of political changes; however, given the difficult budget
situation, it was agreed that the Bank would review with the authorities, each year
starting in 1993, the total road expenditure for the following year, and that any new
investments would proceed after acceptable economic and financial feasibility studies.
B. Achievement of Objectives
9.   The project successfully achieved its major objectives, and carried out the
components identified in the SAR.
Increase efficiency of the sector and accommodate expected changes in transport
demand by improving the condition of the road network
10. The project provided for a first program of enhancement and rehabilitation of main
national roads belonging to European Corridors 4 and 9. It called for the strengthening of
1053 km, for road sections with a daily traffic between 2,000 (min.) and 10,000 (max)
vehicles per day in 1990, and ended up with a total length of 924.2 km rehabilitated. The
roads rehabilitation component financed 14 civil works contracts for roads rehabilitation,
for a total cost of US$ 380.34 million compared to an estimate of US$ 269.32 million for
13 contracts. During execution of contracts, some additional works of reinforcement
(particularly in the difficult mountain areas), and upgrading of some works were included.
All contracts were completed by the Closing Date, though delays as compared with the
schedule were registered with respect to Contracts 1 and 14 in the mountain area. The
original costs of some contracts (particularly (Contracts I and 14) were exceeded during
implementation, due to factors which are reviewed under para. 19 below.
11. The cost estimated for road upgrading varied between US$ 375,000 and US$ 600,000
per km in the SAR, compared with a cost at project closing between US$ 400,000 and US$
985,000, based on costs for completed contracts. The economic rate of return (ERR)
calculated over an assumed 15 years service life, ranged from 23 to 66% at appraisal for the
13 contracts of roads rehabilitation, the actual ERR varies between 23% and 54%, which is
still high (Table 9 of Part II). The rates of return and average costs per km are, however,
difficult to compare, as in many cases the final works differed substantially from the
original design. This objective was substantially achieved.
Promote the selection of transport investments on the basis of economic criteria
12. While before 1990 all investments in the sector were skewed toward very large
projects without regard for economic and financial feasibility, the project developed a
sector strategy which generalized the use of economic feasibility studies as a basis for
decision making on investments. The feasibility study for the project's road component,
though not perfect, was all the more valuable as it was the first one using economic criteria
for the selection of roads; it was done by a domestic research and design institute, and was
financed domestically prior to project start. The study analyzed about 13,000 km of roads
to establish priorities for the rehabilitation program, of which about 1,000 km were selected
for the purposes of the project.  All further investment projects in the sector, including



4
follow-up roads and railways projects financed by the Bank were based on well grounded
feasibility studies undertaken by joint firms of international and domestic consultants. This
objective was fully achieved.
Improve fiscal performance and reduce the uneconomic use of transport and energy
by implementing a cost-based system of road user charges
13. A cost-based system of road user charges is being implemented. As agreed, the
bonrower developed an action plan (AP), that requires revenues from the various road users
to cover their share of the full economic cost of building and maintaining the road network.
The AP was completed and exceeded; it culminated with the establishment of a Road Fund
(legislation passed in 1996) supported by the project. Until 1996 road user charges
consisted of annual vehicle license fees; vehicle registration fees; a 5% tax on the ex-
refinery price of fuels and various fees and tolls. The level of taxation was low and the total
revenues amounted to some US$ 63 million (1992). A Road Fund Law (drawn up with the
assistance of EBRD and IBRD) was passed in 1996, based on a 25% charge on ex-refinery
prices of fuels and a 10% charge on ex-factory prices of vehicles. This generated revenues
of US$ 250 million in 1997, growing further with traffic and vehicle purchasing. However,
roads total costs are estimated at around US$ 400 to 450 million per year. A proposed fixed
annual fee by categories of vehicles was not initially included in the Road Fund. In 1997, a
modlification to the Road Fund Law introduced such a fee. The total collected in 1998 was
about US$ 200 million. The objective was fully accomplished.
Develop the execution of road works by contract
14.  Construction and periodic maintenance of road works by contract has evolved from
insignificant in 1992 (almost all construction and maintenance were "integrated" within
AN!)) to almost 1000/o in 1998. Except for a few activities related to roadside maintenance,
plantation, embankment and river bank protection works (accounting for only 1% of
maintenance activities) all periodic maintenance is now contracted out, as well as
production of road construction and maintenance materials. The target of complete
separation of periodic maintenance from the activity of AND was developed within the
EBRD component of AND institutional component for commercialization of the eight
regional departments, with a view to their further privatization. These departments have
become main AND contractors for periodic maintenance works. Various routine
maintenance activities are still provided by AND through its regional departments, but they
evolve towards execution by contract.
15.  Within the equipment component, the project financed equipment for routine
maintenance only, for a cost of US$ 18.6 million. The selection of such equipment
purchase (multipurpose road maintenance, small asphalt milling machines, snow blower
equipment, etc.) was consistent with AND's medium and long term institutional strategy,
of gradually contracting out routine maintenance activities. The immediate benefits of
using that equipment by AND's territorial branches were translated into a reduction of
AND's manual labor and substantial increase in quality of works. The equipment is
currently owned by AND and administered by its territorial branches, and will be
transferred to the future commercial companies to further emerge from AND during the
commercialization/privatization process. The objective of developing execution of road



works by contract was also accomplished satisfactorily, and the Bank financed equipment
for AND contributed to it.
Support the economic reform program and encourage social stability by financing
geographically dispersed works so as to promote employment generation, providing
opportunities for newly privatized contractors, to the extent possible.
16.  A Construction Industry Study was financed under the project's TA component, with
recommendations on measures to improve the business and contracting climate. The
project was the starting point for the development of a strong domestic construction
industry, which has become 900/o private through the privatization process or newly
established construction companies. There are over 800 such companies, and the industry
provides employment for over 380,000 workers throughout Romania. New public
procurement rules, based on competitive bidding, started to be developed in Romania
through the first Transport Project, at the request of the international financing institutions.
Local contractors were the winning bidders for three contracts financed under the Transport
Project. The new industry has progressively become competitive, and there are currently at
least five internationally competitive Romanian companies, and several joint ventures
bidding for IBRD, EBRD and EIB financed contracts. The above mentioned study, with
inputs from the construction industry, provided the grounds for including the TA
component of the future Second Roads Project. This objective was also fulfilled to the
extent designed initially, and was followed-up in the next project.
C Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
17.  There were no major problems affecting the project, nor were the few ones (as
described below) insurmountable. The overall implementation record was very good, with
excellent project management, timely reportinig and audit submissions, a good
disbursement record, and acceptable quality of works. The total project cost at completion
amounted to US$ 453.9 million, compared to a SAR estimate of US$ 405 million; that was
mainly due to exceeding the cost and time of some civil works contracts. The Axle Load
Control AP was only partially achieved, and r evised under the Second Roads Project.
While most of the otherwise minor problems were subject to implementing agencies'
control, the problem of price escalation formula could not be controlled by either the
agencies, or the MOF, as the Court of Accounts is a Romanian body reporting directly to
the Parliament on public investment expenditure. This problem arose out of an
inappropriate price adjustment clause; the original price escalation formula had been based
only on the US WPI and the exchange rate, and did not cover the actual increase in prices
for construction materials. A new formula was introduced in September 1996, based on
real indices developed since the start of the project. Though MOF had agreed to a
compensation payment based on real price increases and exchange rate changes, the Court
of Accounts (CoA) subsequently disallowed payments under the new formula, arguing that
AND had no right to change it. Eventually the problem was solved through a Government
decision which provided for additional funding.



6
Civil Works
18.  The project financed 14 civil works contracts for road rehabilitation, for a total cost
of US$ 380.34 million for a length of 924.2 km, compared to the estimate of US$ 269.32
million for 1053.0 km. One contract on DN5, toward the Giurgiu border crossing was
added in 1995 (approved to be financed by EBRD, in 1994). All contractors were selected
on the basis of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures outlined in the Bank
Guidelines for Procurement. All contracts were completed by the Closing Date, though
there was a two years delay in finalizing the technically difficult contracts 1 and 14 in the
mountain of "DNI" (National Road No. 1). Supervision of contractors' performance for
the Bank financed contracts was carried out by consultants and was satisfactory.
19.  The original costs of contracts were increased during implementation, due to the
following main factors:
(a)  revision of design. The lack of any road maintenance during that time
combined with a strong traffic increase after 1992 led to a higher deterioration of
roads than anticipated, which was in tum reflected in higher construction costs;
(b)  execution of additional structural support requested by AND in difficult
mountain areas, and upgrading the standards of some roads;
(c)  use of a inappropriate price adjustment clause, which did not cover the high
inflation; the original price escalation formula had been based only on the US WPI
and the exchange rate, and did not cover the huge increase in prices for construction
materials. A new formula was introduced in September 1996, based on real indices
developed since the start of the project. Though MOF had agreed to a compensation
payment based on the difference between price increases and exchange rate changes
for a set period, the Court of Accounts (CoA) subsequently disallowed payments
under the new formula, arguing that AND has no right to change it. Eventually the
problem was solved through a Government Decision which provided for additional
funding of lei 11 billion (about US$ 1.5 million);
(d)  VAT increase from 18% to 22% during project implementation.
20.  In addition to the unallocated funds in the loan, the Bank also approved an
additional amount of US$ 16.2 million for the completion of civil works under the Second
Roads Project (Ln. 41 78-RO).
Materials and Equipment
I. AND Materials and Equipment
21. The Loan Agreement allocated US$ 22 million for the procurement of imported
materials such as bitumen; AND's equipment for routine maintenance such as multi
purpose maintenance vehicles, small asphalt milling machines and manual compactors,
snow blower equipment, bridge inspection vehicles, weigh bridges, traffic counting and
laboratory equipment.



22.  The equipment procurement proceeded as planned, and without difficulties, for an
amount of US$ 20.4 million. Most of it was equipment for road routine maintenance,
which was linked with AND fuiture restructuring plan and institutional development.
The cost was lower than the estimate, which enabled the purchase of more units of such
maintenance equipment. The equipment is in full operation and its benefits materialized
in a substantial increase in quality of maintenance operations, and reduction in AND's
staff/manpower.
II. Railways
23.  The loan provided for an amount of US$ 20 million equivalent to finance the
supply of rail track maintenance machines, hard- and soft-ware for updating Railways
MIS, as well as a small training program, under a Project Agreement between the Bank
and SNCFR. This component was successfully completed with all funds committed two
years ago. A cost overrun on the supply of track maintenance machines due to the
appreciation of the Austrian Shilling during ithe manufacturing period was met by
"borrowing" about $ 1 million from AND's loan funds, which amount was fully repaid
by SNCFR and borne from its own budget. The eight track maintenance machines have
been operating since 1996, and have increased productivity by 50%.
III. Romanian Automobile Register (RAR)
24. The RAR component included procurement of equipment for periodic vehicle
inspection for an amount of US$ 4 million. This component was completed, with an
already improved quality and capacity of vehicle inspections. The new modem
equipment consisting of 41 vehicle inspection lines (one for each county in Romania)
helped transforming RAR into a more efficient institution and enabled car inspections in
line with the EU policy for traffic safety and admitted level of pollution. Both capacity
and quality of inspection have improved significantly by using the new equipment. The
number of inspections increased from less than 200,000 in 1995 to 287,400 in 1996 and
312,100 in 1997. The inspections also revealed the technical situation of the car fleet in
Romania; in 1998, only 27% of inspected vehicles were in compliance with minimum
traffic safety requirements; 23% were below the admitted level of emissions; and only
9% were fully in compliance with all technical, safety and pollution standards.
Technical Assistance and Training
25.  The loan initially allocated US$ 4 million for AND technical assistance and
training, and it included assistance in axle load control; equipment management and
maintenance work by contract; and training of AND managerial and technical staff in
majcr topics such as economic and environmental analyses, design standards and
computer assisted design, pavement management, supervision of works and quality
control. At project completion, the cost of technical assistance and training including
supervision of works, reached US$ 7.7 million, with most of the unallocated amount used
for that category. Such an increase was caused by the financing of the Pre-Investment
studies for the follow-up project (Second Roads), as well as the Construction Industry



8
Study; these studies had not been initially included in the Technical Assistance
component, but were needed to prepare the Second Roads Project which was requested
by the Borrower during implementation of the first Transport Project.
D. Project Smstainability
26.   The Project is considered sustainable and it is likely to maintain and develop its
major objectives through a consistent follow-up on its actions and policies by the two
transport sub-sector projects (roads and railways), currently under satisfactory
implementation. The GOR through its MOT has developed a coherent sector strategy,
including major restructuring of its agencies, supported by the Bank, EBRD, EIB, and EU-
PHARE.
27.   All implementing agencies performed well. Their experience and capacity to carry
out road and rail activities was increased. They are currently being reorganized and
restructured, aiming at improving their commercial viability in a market economy, and
reducing the need for financial support from the Government.
E. Bank Performance
28.    Bank performance was generally satisfactory. Starting the project proved to be a
demanding assignment due to the fact that in 1991 the situation of the transport sector in
Romania was not well known to the Bank. However, preparation was accomplished
relatively quickly, in a joint effort with the other cofinanciers, though there had been no
grant funding for the feasibility study, which was prepared domestically by AND. Some
delays in processing applications for disbursements and replenishment of Special Account
were experienced.
29.    During implementation, the Bank provided prompt attention to the issues of
procurement and proved flexible in the dialogue with the implementing agencies. Staff and
funding for supervision of the project were adequate, and the daily monitoring and dialogue
was efficiently provided through the Resident Mission. The Bank through its missions,
seminars offered on procurement and disbursement, as well as through the permanent open
dialogue with the Client, ensured additional training to the itnplementing agencies. In 1994
and 1995, during project implementation, the dialogue started with GOR on the preparation
of the Railways Project and Second Roads Project, respectively; all Bank missions
efficiently covered both supervision and preparation of follow-up projects. The costs
incurred were relatively low, about US$ 400,000 from preparation through completion,
which compares favorably with other projects of the same character and size.
F. Borrower Performance
30.    AND performed well with regard to project administration. Progress reports were
submitted regularly, as well as good audit reports (though such audit reports were slightly
delayed in terms of timing). Technical performance was generally good, though with some
delays in contract completion (Contracts I and 14), and a few quality deficiencies. There
were no delays in the procurement process; preparation of bidding documents started early
during project preparation, so that many of them were agreed upon at negotiation.
Implementation went well, and disbursements were ahead of schedule during project life.



9
Loan and project covenants were substantially complied with. The Axle Load covenant was
reintroduced into the Second Roads Project and the border crossings component was funded
by PHARE and thus deleted from Bank financing. There were no problems of counterpart
funding availability,
31.    The cooperation with the other financing institutions, i.e. EIB, EBRD and EU-
PHARE, proceeded well. Several missions were undertaken simultaneously and in close
cooperation.
32.    Despite the good organization of PMU in AND, and the staff's good quality and
expertise, the increased number of contracts and tasks related to the several projects
administrated by AND seems to exceed the PMU capacity in terms of staff and equipment.
The Bank has asked AND's management to consider and take measures to ensure optimal
conditions for project management by increasing high level staff, particularly for
procurement. Lack of such measures is likely t:o affect the quality of follow-up projects.
G. Assessnent of Outcome
33.    The overall project outcome is rated as satisfactory, as the project achieved its
objectives with minor shortcomings (see Section B above). The specified amount of road
rehabilitation was carried out, the average ERR at project closing was high; institutional
improvements were made, and the prospect for sustainability of project benefits is good.
H. Future Operations
34.    Two follow-on projects, financed by Loans No. 3976-RO for the Railways
Rehabilitation, and 4178-RO for the Second Roads are under satisfactory implementation
since 1996 and 1997, respectively. The Railways Project, supported by US$120 million of
Bank financing, aims at supporting and deepening the restructuring process which SNCFR
and the Govemment initiated, and finances investments in line with the restructuring
objectives. The project itself is currently under restructuring, due to the transformations
which have taken place within the Railways Company. The Second Roads Project
continues the national roads and bridges rehabilitation process with some additional 1,000
km., further contributes to the institutional strengthening of AND and RAR, and supports
the Borrower in carrying out a Traffic Safety component and an Action Plan for the
reduction of lead in gasoline.  The follow-up projects are intended to ensure the future
operations of the works financed under this project. Some aspects, such as the financing of
road maintenance needs continued attention, while others, like the functioning of the
construction industry can be considered to have established itself on a sound basis, partly
due to the changes induced by the project. Design, bidding and evaluation improvements
addressed under the project are now well established.. The same is valid for RAR and its
inspection activities.
L Key Lessons Learned
35.     The lessons learned from the Transport Project as given below have been addressed
in the follow-on projects, and corrective measures - whenever it was possible - have been
included accordingly:



10
(a) Particular attention should be given to the quality of designs, with as little time
delay as possible between design and execution.
(b) A contract price adjustment formula which takes into account actual changes
in the underlying parameters and which is agreed by all the institutions which have
a say in this matter, is important for effective contract administration.

Having in view the background of the transport system in Romania and the
major changes that took place in the different transport sectors, in its policy making
and regulation functions and institutions, the Transport Project was fiily justified
because of the following reasons:
- the ongoing macro economic and structural reforms had to be accompanied
by the physical reconstruction of critical assets;
- given the deteriorated condition of the infrastructure, there was un urgent
need for making up the deffered maintenence which was possible only by means of
ext.ernal support.
- the Project components promote the reformn of enterpnrse and orivate sectors.
The Project was prepared and apprised jointly with EBRD and EIB as
Cofinanciers.
The parries involved in this agreement were:
Borrower:   ROMANIA
The Bank:   International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development
Benezciaries: National Administration of Roads (NAR)
Romanian Automobile Registrar
Romanian Railways (SNCFR)
The loan amount is USD120 million equivalent, allccated as follows:
- USD 96 million to National Administration of Roads for implementing Part
A. of the Project;
- USD  4 miilion to Romani an Automobile Registrar for impliementing Part B
of the Project:
- USD ZO million to SNCFR for implementing Part C of the Project.
Proiect Objectives
- (a) to increase efficiency of the sector and accomodate the expected changes
in transport desmand by improvingr the state of the road network:
- (b) to promote selection of transport investments on the basis of economic
cr,teria
- (c) to improve fiscal performance and reduce the uneconomical use of
transport and energy by implementing a cost-based system charges for road users;
- (d) to develop the execution of the'roads work by contract,
- (e) to build on transport policy initiatives under TACI project particulary
with regard to the investments selection and railways restructuring;
3



Appendix A
Page 3 of 12
- (f) to support the economic reform and encourage social stability by
financing geographically dispersed works, thereby promoting employment and
providing opportunities for the engagement of recently formed contractors. In this
respect, a program to gradually shift maintence work from force account to
contract has been agreed with the National Administration of Roads (NAR).
Proiect Descrintion.
The Project included the followina components:
- rehabilitation of some 1,100 km of national roads;
- improvement of border posts;
- material and equipment for road safety, road maintenance, vehicle inspection
and ratrainn;
- tecruical assistance and training tFor the road subsector;
- urgently nedeed track maintenance and data processing equipment, spare
parcs and training for the railways.
All sections retained for the project have been of a high prioritv and have had
rates of return above 20%.
Benents and Risks:
The Prcject was expected to plav an important roie in accomodating rhe
economic reorientation of transport demand to road transport and start
reszructuriMa the railways accordinc1y.
Quantifiable benefits for the road rehabilitation component were expected to be
in the form of the reduced vehicle operating costs (VOC). Also, the value of the
road expenditure requirements at the time was to be reduced by undertaking road
strenghtening and avoiding more expensive reconstruction after that date. Road
maintenance expenditures were supposed to decrease on the rehabilitatated roads.
Also, the road safety component was to contribute to the reduction in accidents,
benefits beinz supposed to  accrue to  a large and widespread number of
beneficiaries. Another issue that was aimed at. was that of obtaining lower road
transport costs and time savings for vehicle owners as well as for users. For the
railway components benefits consisted in reduced operating costs and improved
traffic safetv.
The risks of the Project were estimated to be low. At that time. the Government
of Romania. Ministry of Transport and NAR have expressed strong interest in the
project that was bound to continue even in the event of political changes. The main
fear that the Govemrnment would not havetsufficient counterpart funds proved to be
groundless as all the counterpart fund: were allocated in due tine whenever
necessary.

Part A
During the five-years period from the effectiveness date of the loan, due to the
changes in the macroeconomic environment, modifications have been operated to
the initial amounts, resulting in the reassesment of funds by components, as the
adjustments required within the same limits, with the Bank's approval and according
to the legislation in force. Therefore, the initial amounts had to be amended due to
modifications of the quantity structure of works perforned that took place during
the period between elaboration of the Tender Documents (1992-1993) and
execution and completion of works (1996-1997). The severe weather conditions of
the winters 1995/1996 and 1997/1998 together with the increased heavv trafic
contributed to important deterioration of the road surface, leading to additional
works needed for stabilizing the road system and for ensuring the tradc safety. All
these have determined additional time and costs.Thus, it was necessarv to reallocate
USD 1,557,572.14 that remained unutilized from Categorv *Materials &
Equipment" (local and imported) to Category "Civil Works".
The rapid deterioration of the road network has required irther rehabilitation
of other imporrant sections located mainly on European routes. For this purpose
and also in order to obtain funds for the rehabilitation of other sections totalising
about 1.500 km. the Borrower and the Bank ascreed to use the amount of USD
2.000,000 from Catezory "Unallocated" for the elaboration of a pre-investment
s-udy and the desien of the selected road sections for the secord and the third
rehabilitation stages.
This reallocated amount has created the opportunity for newv loans both for the
second staze of the national roads rehabilitation (co-financed bv MRD. EBRD,EM
and the Romanian Governmnent) - for a total amount of USD552.000,000 and for
the third staze (co-financed by EIB, BRD and the Romanian Government).
Regarding the situation of the construction industrv in Romania. an amount of
USD  150,000 was reallocated to Category 1 (c) - "Consultant's services and
training " for a studv that emphasized the new financial environment and the means
of adaptation to the conditions of market economy and to new technologies.
Necessary arnounts were also reallocated to Category I (c). for technical
assistence to the Project Implementation Unit (PI?), as provided in the Staff
Apprisal Report issued by the World Bank in March 1993. In order to improve
professional skills of NAR specialists, the Bank proposed traininz programs abroad
on procedures, regulation and administration of loans granted by international
financial institutions.
The reallocations of funds became official by means of Governmental Decisions.
.As the finds provided for in the Loan 3593 - RO proved to be insufficient for
the completion of the Project. NAR requested to use an additional amount of USD
16,245,000 from the proceeds of the MRE Loan 4178 - RO that was contracted for
the Second Transport Project. The Bank approved that request on November 13",
1997 and the Romanian Government also issued an Emergency Ordinance

confirming the use of the fiunds under Loan 4178 -RO to complete contracts under
Loan 3593-RO.
Proiect Implementation:
Under the Transport Modernization Project, NAR concluded 33 contracts
financed by the World Bank. 20 contracts financed by EBRD and 5 contracts
financed by the EIB.
The Final List of Roads, corresponding to Tabel 12 in the Staff Aopraisal
Report (SAR) for the Project is presented in Annex I.
The Effective Financing Plan corresponding to Financing Plan in SAR is
presented in Annex II.
The Closing Date for the Loan Agreement. i.e. December 31"i1998 was
observed, ail contracts being finalized by that date and all works completed in time.
(1) Road Rehabilitation (a)
The Romanian contractors involved in the Project have accomplished
tremendous progress in their practice of international competitive bidding. As a
result of the program thev are now more familiar with the conditions of
procurement. the FIDIC World Bank conditions of contract and with payment
procedures.They appear also to have understood that, eventually, the constrains
inposed on them by the program regulations have also worked to their advantage
bv forcing them to steamline their orzanisation in order to improve etficiency.
mTe local contractors were also involved in a continuous know-how transfer
under the strict control of inernational supervision consultants.
Whereas at the beginning of the project local contractors have indulged in
their former wavs of doing works, they have improved drastically their operations
after realising that no more profit could be obtained that way. This is demonstrated
by the very slow progress of disbursements at the start of the prograrn when the
NAR advised by the supervision consultants have rejected some of the works
performned.
However, these benefits took time to be implemented on the site as the local
contractors had to re-organize their system of operations.
Another proof for the progress recorded can be seen in the pricing of the
Second Road Project tenders: whereas, for the First Project. tenders by local
contractors appeared to be highly questionable, for the Second Project they
ascertained much more realistic costs.
It is also worth noting that local sub-contractors have greatly benefited from
their involvement in the Project. In some instances, international contractors have
devoted time and resources to train their subcontractors abroad by sending
personnel down to the level of equipment operator to attend training courses.
6

Also, new techniques have been implemented, such as modified bitumen for
asphalt pavements, which were not known to Romanian consultants. As a result, a
real progress in the road industry technology has been achieved.
The Project has played an important role in accomodating the econornic
reorientation of transport demand to road transport. Quantifiable benefits have been
obtained in the form of reduced vehicle operatincg costs (VOC) relating to fuel
consumption, tire wear and general maintenance costs, time and wage savings. The
undertaking, of the road strenghtening in order to avoid more expensive
reconstruction at a later date has also reduced expenditures. Maintenance
expenditures. for the rehabilitated roads have decreased and the traffic safety has
been improved as the number of accidents was reduced by elimination of black
spots.
As for :he lessons taught by the First Transport Project were the foilowings:
Design and preparation of Tender Documents must be approached in a more
rational manner. Local desieners were not familiar with international practice and
consequentlv thev were responsible for the poor qualitv of desia which has resulted
in increased costs. A lesson. in that regard, is that the local desi_ners should not be
left off the mainstream of skills improvement and should benefit &rom training, either
on-site or abroad.
It is also clear that NAR has demonstrated some weaknesses in monitoring its
schedule of disbursements and corrunitments due to absence of a clear and
permanently updated Procurement and Disbursement Plan at the very, start of the
Project when training would have proved necessary.
The instirutional and legal environment in this countrv have not proved
adequate for the efficient implementation of the Project. For instance, overlapping
control byv Ni.AR and the Ministry of Public Works has hampered the quality control
carried out bv the supervision consultants. On the other hand, there are some
clauses in the Romanian road law which have to be reexamined in order to improve
the institutional and technical efficiency (involvement of designers in working
drawings, mandatory technical assistance by the designers on site during
implementation).
(2) Border crossines (b)
NAR proposed and IBRD agreed durinsg the supervision mission in December
1994 to delete from IBRD project all border crossings, as PHARE funds became
available for this particular category.
(3) Road safetv (c)
The proposed 5,000 km of roz.ds were signaled and marked in accordance
with the European standards.

Although it is difficult to estimate the economic return of this component, the
imrnediate benefit consisted in the decrease of the number of accideents, due to the
horizontal marking of the roads (center and sidelines).
(4) Materials and Eguipment (d)
As regards the procurement of bitumen, after the first tender was held and
the offer has been awarded to a Romanian company. PETROLSTUB, it became clear
that Romanian industry can cope with the quality conditions imposed by the
technical specifications of the Project. The amounts left were reallocated to other
categories within the same limits. with the Bank's approval and according to the
legislation in force.
Consequently, the remailnina amounts were reallocated for equipment
procurement and for the additional works that proved to be necessary during the
progress of the Project.
(5) Technical Assistance and Training (e)
Tne main tasks of the Consultant (BECOM-France) within the contract for
supervision of the First Transport Project were to:
- supervise the civil works of the program,
- assist NAR's PIR in fulfilinc their tasks:
- provide a training program for the NAR's staff.
As regards the supervision of works, the transfer of know-how and
responsibilities from the foreign engineers to the Romanian staff has been
successful. As a result, more than 45 local staff benefited from the cooperation with
foreign specialists and are now able to supervise other works on their own.
As for the technical assistance to PRU, the support from the technical experts
assisted by a financial expert has been realy important for the programming and
coordination of the Project as weU as for its financial management.
In addition to this support, PIU  as bcne4j- d rr  the training program
organized bv the Consultant abroad, concerning the Project, contract and financial
management as well as cost estimates and quality control.
Another important activitv within this category has been the training of
NAR's staff on the basis of a contract awarded to Groupment EPC (France ) -
LAVALIN (Canada). Under this contract within a period of 2 years, more than 400
NAR's employees participated in variout forms of training of which about 20%
were trained abroad in a large variety of t chnical subjects.
Given the large number of peo'ple trained and the very wide palette of
technical subjects attended, the general level of professional skill of NAR's
employees has been considerably raised..

Appendix A
Page 8 of 12
Based on this training component, NAR intends to embark upon a long tcrn
staff training strategy by creating a permanent structure such as the Department of
Human Resources Management.
The pre-investment sttidy for the Second Project, financed from the same
Loan category, proved to be very important for the preparation of the Second
Project.
Its main objectives were the identification and the prioritization of the road
sections to be rehabilitated, taking into account the actual state and capacity of the
national roads network, as well as the preparation of the design for the works to be
carried out and the tender documents.
An important lesson learned from the First Project was the importance of a
good preparation of any project, especially from the design point of view, in order
to avoid any errors that later on might bring important additionai cOsts.
The construction industry study, financed under the same category has
emphasized the new financial environment in Romania and has proposed means of
adaptation to the new conditions of a market economy based on new technologies.
Part B
By the time the Loan Agreement was signed. the whole vehicle inspection
activity was carried out within service stations, using rented apparatus which did not
perform at the international standards, and therefore, an adequate technological
endowment was necessary. That meant high technical equipments that had to be
imported, since they were not produced in Romania. Using the amounts of the
Loan. the following aquisitions were made: 40 vehicle testing lines. a emission levels
testing laboratorv in accordance with the no.24,46,43 ECE UNO Regulations. The
total amount of disbursements was of USD 3.999,914. All the inspection lines
procured bv the end of 1995 were installed during 1996. The equipment for the
emission levels testing laboratory was procured by the end of 1996 and is now being
mounted.
As a conciusion, regarding the technical control and supervision, by means of
the material support created by the EBRD financed endowment. RAR will be able to
observe the EU Directives that lie at the basis of the vehicles technical control.
Taking into consideration the permanent need to join the international
standards in this field, RAR proposed the Ministry of Transport to issue two
important decisions stipulating the alignment to EURO 2 poilution standards of all
imported vehicles beginning with 1998 and with 2000 for the national producers
(MaOT Decision no. 157/1997). and the approval of the new norms on road vehicles
registering as well as the right for periodic testing and the surveillance of the
stations carring out this activity on the Romanian territorv (MOT Decision
no.353/1998).
Therefore. the main benefit in this area is the important qualitative
improvement of this specific activity, that would have been impossible otherwise.
The analysis of technical and economic indicators has shown an evolution
of the physical output in 1997 and a standstill in 1998. As a result, the revenues from
9



Appendix A
Page 9 of 12
this activity represented around 80% in 1996, 75% in 1997 and 70% in 1998 out of
the total revenues obtained by RAR. This decrease in revenues from regular
technical inspections is due to the development of new activities that determined
the global increase of the respective turnover.
Revenues increase shows a rising evolution uncorrelated to that of the
physical output due to the inflation rate that imposed the permanent adjustment of
the tarrifs with the prices evolution on the domestic market.
On the other hand it has to be stated that the implementation of the new
standards and the activity of modifSying the legislation in the field of regular
technical inspections became more and more difficult with time.
As reaarding the proper ongoing and implementation of the Project, as well
as of consultancy, there were certain shortcomings in the cooperation process with
NAR which was responsible for all disbursements and repayment of the Loan
according to the provisions of the SLA and the Agreement between RAR and NAP.
Among such shortcomings, the following can be mentioned:
- unjustiried delays in disbursements;
- improper and delayed notification on disbursements payments and other
important issues concerning the Loan;
- incorrect calculation of the interest and commissions paid by NAR for the
account of RAR resulting in unjustified higher charges for the latter.
The specialists of the two companies are at present discussing all these issues
in order to properlv clear up the marter.
These shortcomings have clearly shown the necessity to develop certain
instruments of control and verification in order to ensure a better cooperation
between the final beneficiaries of external loans for the future.
On the other hand this Project has represented a valuable experience for RAP.
in dealine with international financial organizations and manaaina external loans.
Considering the complex experience gained and the specialists that have been
forrned With the occasion of this Project, it is considered that R-AR will be able to
manage by itself possible future loans if necessary.
Taking into account the specific modality of carrying on the loan by means of
three beneficiaries. out of which NAR is the only one responsible with the
disbursements for the other two beneficiaries. and as long as there is a single
implementation unit for the Project. misunderstandings related to the disbursement
of the amounts appeared. There were also problems concerning the relevant
beneficiaries costs between NAR and SNCFR and also, between NAR and RAR.
Part C
According to the provisions of the Loan Agreement, the USD 20,000,000
were to be used as follows:
- USD 19,800,000 for procurement of goods, i.e. equipment needed for the
maintenance of the railways superstructure-
- USD 200.000 for traing of specialists.
10



Appendix A
Page 10 of 12
As regarding the first component, SNCFR concluded:
a) a contract with Plasser & Theurer Company, Austria for specific railway
machines that performed better than expected all over the considered period. The
using of these machines materialized in superior quality of the works performed and
in about one year-enlargement of the duration between two succesive interventions
over the railway, which led to achieving better financial and economic indicators.
As concerning the payments within the contracts, a few details should be
aiven:
- the amounts payable to Plasser & Theurer Companv were expressed in
ATS;
- due to ATS - USD exchange rate, a deficit of USD 816,425,88 for SNCFR
was recorded;
- the scored deficit was transfered from Category (4) - 'Unallocated"of the
Loan Azreement to Category (3) a). NAR disbursed that arnount for the account of
SNCFR,
- further to this reallocation NAR has opened a new deposit account in
which SNCFR transfered the amount of USD 316,425.88.
The problem of how all these aspects are to be reflected and recorded is now
under consideration jointly by IBRD. MIOF, SNCFR and NAR.
b) a contract with Intrasoft Greek Companv of CSD 6. 782.660 for data
processing equipment. The equipments procured within this contract were delivered
on time and no problems were encountered as concernung the technicai
performances.
With respect to the training component, SNCFR concluded a contract of
L[SD 178,386 with Italfer Companv. Italy. This contraca mainiy envisaged the
implementation of a professional training program  for the representatives of
SNZCFR. takinz into account the aliznment to EU Directives.
The total amount of the disbursements concernuing the training program was
of USD 166,031.56.
The unutilized USD 33,000 amount has been used for the advance payment
to the Contract for technical assistence for speeding up SNCFR restructuring
process agreed upon with Chambers, Conlon 7 Harwell Company. USA within the
Loan Agreement no.3976 - RO.
On the whole, we consider that the Project achieved its objectives in a
satisfactory manner. The key lessons drawn from the different issues that appeared
and had to be dealted with all along the implementation process will certainly help
the Ministry of Finance and the beneficiares to improve their performance with
regard to future projects.
