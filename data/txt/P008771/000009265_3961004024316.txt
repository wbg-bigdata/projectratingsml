LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrowers               Romania
Beneficiarims:          National Road Administration, Romanian Automobile
Registrar and National Railroad Company of Romania
Lon Amount:             US$120 million equivalent
T-rma                   Seventeen years, including 5 year grace at the
standard variable interest rate
Proiect Obiectivem
and Descriptions        The objectives of the project are to: (a) increase
efficiency of the sector and accommodate expected
changes in transport demand by improving the condition
of the road networki (b) promote the selection of
transport investments on the basis of economic
criteria; (c) improve fiscal performance and reduce
the uneconomic use of transport and energy by
implementing a cost-based systm of road user charges;
(d) develop the execution of road works by contract;
(e) build on transport policy initiatives under the
TACI project particularly with regard to investment
selection and restructuring of the railways; and
(f) support the economic reform program and encourage
social stability by financing geographically dispersed
efficient employment generation, including in newly
privatizing contracting companies to the extent
possible.
The project includes: (a) rehabilitation of some 1,100
km of national roads; (b) improvsment of border posts;
(c) material and equipment for road safety, road
maintenance, vehicle inspection and training;
(d) technical assistance and training for the road
subsector; and (e) urgently needed track maintenance
and data processing equipment, spare parts and
training for the railways.



ii
Benefits and Risks:      The project is expected to play an important role in
accommodating the aconomic reorientation of transport
demand to road transport and start restructuring the
railways accordingly. Quantifiable benefits for the
road rehabilitation component will be in the form of
reduced vehicle operating costs (VOC), i.e. lower fuel
consumption, tire wear and general vehicle maintenance
costs, time and wage savings. Also, the present value
of road expenditure requirements will be reduced by
undertaking road strengthening now and avoiding more
expensive reconstruction at a later date. Road
maintenance expenditures will also decrease on
rehabilitated roads. The road safety component will
contribute to the reduction in accidents. The
benefits will accrue to a large and widespread number
of beneficiaries. Lower road transport costs and time
savings will benefit vehicle owners as well as users.
For the railway components benefits will consist of
reduced operating costs and improved traffic safety.
Project risks are low. The GOR, NOT and NRA have
expressed strong interest in the project, and are
likely to proceed even in the event of political
changes. The main risk is that the GOR would not have
sufficient counterpart funds. However, the local
component of US$125 million would be affordable. It
would amount annually over the project implementation
period to one third of total highway expenditures
budgeted for 1992. NRA is budgeting for its
contribution as a top priority within its existing
budgetary allocation.

ROMANIA
TRANSPORT PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THZ TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. The Transoort Svstem
1.01        Romania is one of the largest of the former centrally planned
economies in the Central and East European (CDE) Region with a land area of
237,000 sq. km and a population of 23 million, second only to Poland. Per
capita income in 1992 was estimated at about $1,225. The country has a wide
range of natural resources, including a fertile agricultural base, deposits of
coal, lignite, oil, natural gas and other minerals. Long a major food
producer, Romania was a large exporter of agricultural products until the
early eighties.
1.02        The transport system has relied primarily on the railways, which
have a well developed network of 11,000 km, of which 36% is electrified and
26% is double track. There are about 1000 stations for freight and
passengers. The road network totals 73,000 km, of which 20% are national
roads carrying 60% of the road traffic. Road density, with regard to both
population and land area, is the lowest among all CEE countries. The Danube
offers a navigable distance of 1075 km in Romania and the Danube-Black Sea
Canal (68 km) was opened to traffic in 1984. Ninety percent of foreign trade
is handled through the port of Constanza on the Black sea. There are five
major river ports on the Danube, the largest of which is Galati, accessible to
ocean-going vessels up to 15,000 tons. There are seventeen airports of which
3 are international.
B. Traffic
1.03        As in other centrally planned economies, Romania's transport
sector has been heavily rail oriented. In 1960, rail accounted for over 80%
of freight traffic and over 70% of passenger traffic (Tables 1 and 2). While
the rail share has gone down since then, in 1989, rail still accounted for
almost 70% of freight and about 40% of passenger traffic. The higher share of
rail freight was the result of regulation forcing all transport above 50 km to
the railways. This regulation has now been abolished. Rail freight reached
300 million tons and 80 billion ton-km in the late 80s, but has fallen
dramatically over the last two years. In 1991, it was down to less than half
its 1989 level at 37 billion ton-km. Passenger traffic held off better, being
down less than 30%.
1 04        Road traffic grew rapidly in the 70s but stagnated in the 80s as
it was suppressed by physical control and regulation (Table 3). The last two
years have seen an explosion of private car traffic. Truck traffic has been
less buoyant due to the downturn in the economy, but has been affected much
less than rail traffic.
1.05        Traffic through Constanza port was around 60 million tons p.a. in
the late 80s, but in 1991, only 28 million tons were handled (Table 4). Of
the earlier traffic, about 60% was liquid bulk and another 30% dry bulk,



leaving only about 5 million tons of general cargo. Container traffic was
small but hau increased rapidly since 1989 as Romania's markets are
diversifying. Inland water traffic is insignificant at only 3% of total land
traffic. On the Danube-Black Sea Canal, traffic reached 12.5 million tons in
1989, well below the forecasts of 75 million tons made in 1979 before
construction. Traffic in 1990 had fallen to some 6 million tons. Maritime
traffic carried by the Romanian fleet quadrupled in the 70s from 4 to 16
million tons p.a. and more than doubled again to 36 million tons in 1989.
C. Investments
1.06        Investments in the transport sector have been around 10% of total
investments, substantially below the level in market economies. Until the
late-70s, railways got the bulk of the investments in the sector. Later, the
balance shifted toward water transport (maritime, river and canals) with the
construction of the new Constanza port, the Danube-Black Sea Canal and the
Bucharest-Danube Canal (now abandoned) and a major increase in the maritime
fleet. In the 80s, total water transport investments absorbed well over 50%
of total transport investments, while rail received about 27%. By comparison,
investments in road infrastructure decreased from 9% in the late 70c to less
than 5% in the 80s (Table 5). In the 80s construction started on the
Bucharest metro and between 1986 and 1990, this absorbed about twice the
amounts invested in the entire road infrastructure of Romania. In the last
two years, investments in the sector have come to a virtual halt. The 1992
investment budget for the whole sector is US$35 million, only allowing for
urgent capital repairs and periodic maintenance and no new investments.
D. Institutions
1.07        In 1990 and 1991, major changes took place in the transport
institutions. The former Ministry of Transport and Public Works was split
into two separate Ministries. The Ministry of Transport (MOT) was reorganized
to concentrate on policy making and regulation functions rather then being an
operator of transport means (Chart 1). The railways, highways and ports
became autonomous units or "Regis Autonomes" (RA), while road transport
departments, construction departments and design or research institutes became
respectively transport companies, contractors and consultants commercial
companies (CC). The shares of these CC are still owned 100% by the state, but
with the intention of privatization as and when feasible.
E. Sectoral Issues
1.08        One of the main problems of the sector is to evaluate the future
volume and vattern of transport demand. The shift to a market economy, is
likely to result in less emphasis on transport intensive industries such as
steel, cement and petrochemicals and more on higher value added light industry
such as textiles and agro-industry. The latter will require lower transport
volumes and are more likely to use road transport than rail or water
transport. Romania's use of energy was also very intensive. The demand for



coal transport may decline when energy subsidies are phased out, railway coal
tariff. are increased and industries conserve fuel to reduce operating costs.
On the passenger side, all modes of transport have already increased tariffs
substantially and will continue to do so in the future, in order to reduce the
need for subsidies. This could moderate travel demand, until income growth
resumes. Automobile traffic is likely to grow significantly from a low base.
The emphasis of the proposed project on the road subsector is appropriate as
the role of road transport for freight and passengers can only increase with
the structural reforms of the economy. Demand forecasts for rail and water
transport will be done as part of studies now underway.
1.09        As mentioned above, investments in the sector were skewed toward
very large projects without regard for economic and financial feasibility.
The result is that funds for replacement of life expired equipment and
modernization were scarce. Existing infrastructure and equipment are obsolete
and service availability is low. This is particularly evident in the road
sector which received low priority in the past. We are working with the NOT
on a sector strategy that would generalize the use of economic feasibility
studies as a basis for improving decision making on investments.
1.10         The sector was no exception to the general distortions resulting
from administrative rather than market prices Fuel prices are still
controlled, but Government policy is to ensure that they reflect fluctuations
in world markets. Under the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) agreement has
been reached that Government would adjust them periodically for price and
exchange rate movements. In late 1992, pump prices were US$0.34/1. for
gasoline and US$0.26/1. for diesel. Transport prices are free for freight but
still regulated for public passenger transport. NRA has drafted a proposal
for introducing a comprehensive system of road user charges and retained
consultants under the Technical Assistance and Critical Imports (TACI) Project
- Loan 3363-RO to advise on this matter and recommend a system that would
ensure that the various users pay their share of the full economic cost of
building and maintaining the road network. A timetable for the introduction
of a comprehensive system of road user charaes within a year of completion in
mid-1993 of the study was reconfirmed at neaotiations (para. 6.01 a and
Table 7).
F. Sector Strategv
1.11        The following principles and policies are guiding the future
action of government in the transport sector:
a)    Equality of treatment between transport enterprises and state
owned transport means;
b)    Financial autonomy of transport companies;
c)    Freedom of action of transport enterprises;
d)    Free modal choice by transport users; and
e)    Correct allocation of investments based on economic benefits for
the country.



- 4 -
Regarding investments in the sector, the strategy of the Ministry of Transport
is as follows:
a)    Short  term- arrest the technical and operational deterioration of
the system;
b)    Medium term - consolidate and renovate the existing transport
capacity through the free competition between modesl and
C)    Longer term - modernize and develop the infrastructure, equipment
and vehicles to match the economic and technical levels of Western
Europe.
This strategy is sound and is clearly reflected in this project on the
investment side as well as by the agreements reached regarding reforms to be
introduced in the sector.
G. Previous Bank Experience in the Sector
1.12        The Bank financed two projects in the transport sector: the
Danube-Black Sea Canal Project (Loan 1794-RO) of US$100 million of January
1980 and the Land Transport Project (Loan 2034-RO) of US$125 million approved
in April 1981. In January 1987, OED issued the PPAR for the first project.
The main conclusion was that, although completion was 17 months behind
schedule, the work was generally good. However traffic did not materialize to
the extent expected and therefore, the financial results and economic benefits
were lower than estimated. A main issue raised in the report concerns the
Bank's role. The Bank loan came five years after construction of the canal
had started and mainly supplied finance (about 5% of total cost). It would
have been better to participate earlier in the project cycle to have an impact
on technical and economic decisions before they were made.
1.13        The second project was completed and the loan closed on schedule
in May 1987. The PCR was issued in January 1992. The overall assessment is
satisfactory. Disbursements were faster than expected and the project cost
well below estimates. Economic returns are lower than expected following the
downturn in the economy since 1990 but all components remain justified.
Issues of past irregular procurement practices were highlighted by the
Government in its commentary on the project. The Government is anxious to
cooperate fully with the Bank in designing and implementing new projects. The
cooperation throughout the proposed project's preparation has been
outstanding, with the Bank's comments on project design, concept and
implementation fully taken into account.
H. Role of the Bank and Lendino Strateav
1.14        The Bank has begun the process of assisting the reform of the
transport sector through technical assistance for studies in the road, ports
and urban transport subsectors. The road user charges study, the railway
restructuring study and the urban transport study financed under the Technical



Assistance and Critical Imports (TACI) Project (Loan 3363-RO) are underway. A
port master plan study for Constansa, financed by the Netherlands started in
March 1992 and IC PHARN will finance some technical assistance for pavement
management. These studies simply begin our familiarization effort in the
sector. Real institutional reform will require continuous, long term,
technical assistance, only possible when combined with investment lending.
The proposed project is our first loan in the sector since lending resumed and
will focus mainly on highway rehabilitation and maintenance. It also includes
technical assistance and training in the road and rail subsectors as well as a
small railways component for well justified and urgently needed equipment, so
basic that it would be needed in any restructuring scenario. Depending upon
the timing and nature of railway restructuring after completion of the study,
the Bank would be willing to assist such a process.
II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. Network and Traffic
2.01        Public roads in Romania are classified in a three-tier system:
national roads, district roads and communal roads. The National Road
Administration (NRA) is responsible for the national road network. The
district and communal roads are directly under the local administrations,
however, NRA provides technical assistance on standards and project design.
2.02        In 1992, the road network totalled about 73,000 km of which some
15,000 km were national roads.

2.03        In the past, roads and road transport were neglected as emphasis
was placed on rail transport. As a result, the condition of the network
deteriorated, particularly in the 1980.. It is estimated that about one third
of the national road network, 5000 km, require some form of strengthening to
avoid failure. In 1991 and 1992, what was left in the budget after routine
maintenance, allowed NRA to do only 500 km of periodic maintenance.   This

would give a cycle of 30 years for the 15,000 km network, while the need would
typically be for a 7-10 year cycle. The proposed project is focusing on the
urgent need to strengthen the national road network, which carries 60% of the
total road traffic in the country and all international transit traffic.
2.04        Road traffic grew continuously until 1980.  However, traffic on
national roads fell in the 19809 when fuel was rationed and stricter
restrictions applied to road transport, i.e. trucks and buses could only
operate within district boundaries and all transport beyond 50 km had to be
done by rail. The average transport distance for road freight was only 12 km
in 1989. After the revolution, in 1990, road traffic jumped to 46% above
1989, with all the increase due to private cars. In 1991, following fuel
price increases, traffic was still 23% above 1989. This in comparison with
rail traffic which has fallen off by 50% for freight and about 30% for
paosengers between 1989 and 1991. Future forecasts are difficult to make with
confidence until economic growth resumes. Examples from other countries
indicate that once growth resumes, road traffic can be expected to grow even
faster than GDP from relatively low levels at present.
2.05        Detailed traffic surveys, including Origin-Destination surveys are
conducted once every five years on the entire national road network with the
last one done in 1990. In the intervening years, continuous traffic counting
is performed at over 350 locations on the network. Traffic distribution is
assumed constant between the two detailed surveys. To improve the system, the
project includes the acquisition of some classification counters which will
provide continuous data on traffic composition, rather than once every five
year under the present system. Lese than 10% of the network has traffic
levels in excess of 6,000 vehicles per day (vpd) and less than 3% have over
10,000 vpd.

B. Road Transport
2.06        Road transport was completely deregulated in 1990 for freight and
passenger services. Transporters are now free to enter and operate any route
they wish and determine their own tariffs for freight.   The single large road
transport company under HOT and the other 423 own account transport companies
operated by various ministries for their own sectors have been transformed
into smaller units (average of 280 vehicles per company versus 500 in 1989) am



follows: the freight companies are commercial companies with state ownership
of capital (share companies), while the 55 passenger companies are Regies
Autonomes administered by the 41 districts and the Municipality of Bucharest.
In addition to these state owned companies, there are already over 2000
private transport companies, generally in the form of limited liability
companies. The average size of private companies and individual transporters
is small. The intention is to privatize the state owned companies starting
with those dealing with freight.
2.07        There were 1.9 million 4 wheel vehicles registered in 1991 or
about 76 vehicles per 1000 population. This is the lowest ratio of vehicles
per capita in all CEE countries except Albania. Commercial vehicles --buses,
trucks and tractors -- account for 28% of the fleet with cars comprising the
remainder. Cars are concentrated in the urban areas, with Bucharest
accounting for 20% of the registration, and traffic on major intercity roads
has a high proportion of heavy vehicles, often exceeding 30%, which is double
the average proportion in other CEE countries as well as in France and the UK.
2.08        The Romanian Automobile Registrar (RAR), a public corporation
(Regie Autonome) is responsible for registering all road vehicles, as well as
for periodic testing for technical conditions and emission levels. Trucks and
buses are tested annually and cars every two years. Except in Bucharest, most
testing stations still have only rudimentary equipment. Emission tests are
limited to measuring carbon monoxide (CO). The project includes financing for
RAR to equip test stations with modern equipment including facilities to test
brakes, lights, steering and measure emissions of other pollutants such as NOx
and C02.
2.09        The present legal axle load is 10 tons for a single axle on
motorways and European roads (4,500 km) and 8 tons on other roads. NRA is
studying the consequences of adopting the 11.5 ton limit of the European
Community for roads and bridges on European roads as well as increasing the
bearing capacity on other national roads and technical assistance is included
in the project to assist them with this study. Trucks are only weighed at
border posts and not on roads within the country. Overloading was a problem
before the revolution, mostly on roads in the vicinity of large construction
sites. While the problem is less acute now, it is likely to come back with
economic development. The project includes weighbridges to improve data
collection for pavement design and as a basis to revise axle load legislation
and strengthen enforcement.  An action clan for imorovina axle load control
was Precared with NRA (Table 7) with a view to collect data and revise present
legislation to facilitate enforcement. This clan was reconfirmed at
neaotiations (para. 6.01 b).
C. Road Safet
2.10        Road traffic accidents have become a serious problem over the last
few years.  In 1990, there were 9,700 serious accidents, injuring 8,400
persons and causing 3,800 deaths. These numbers are three times higher than
in 1985. The incidence of fatalities is much higher than in Western Europe
but comparable to rates found in other CEZ countries. The Bank-sponsored Road



Safety Study team in Central and Zaztern Europe will vlsit Romania ln
February 1993 and recommend ways to improve the situation. It was aare-d at
neaotiations that a olan to imorove road safety would be oresared by th-
National Committee on Road Transport on the basiz of the recommendations of
the study team (oara. 6.01 c).
2.11        Regarding the technical aspects of road safety which are within
its control, NRA is working on eliminating hazardous points on the network.
Due to lack of funds and unavailability of modern materials, horizontal
markings such as a center line and border lines are completely missing and
vertical signs are very deficient even on the national road network. The
proposed project includes a program to improve markings and signaling on som
5,000 km of priority roads which are designated Zuropean Roads by NRA.
D. Hiahwav Administration and Oroanization
2.12        The NRA is a public service corporation (Regie Autonom-) depending
on the budget for virtually all of its resources. Its present organization is
shown in Chart 2. In 1992, NRA employed some 15,000 persons. The work force
consists of 1,600 technical and administrative staff and 13,400 workers. Only
100 persons are presently employed at headquarters in Bucharest. The NRA is
reducing its labor force through the creation of construction CCs and
attrition.
2.13        The field organization consists of 7 regional directorates further
divided into 41 sections, their borders coinciding with those of
administrative districts. Zach section is divided into 4 to 6 districts for
routine and winter maintenance. In addition, there are some 140 units for
periodic resurfacing and strengthening, each one quipped with one asphalt
plant and the corresponding transport and paving equipment (Chart 3). Other
equipment is held at the district level. There are small workshops for
maintenance and minor repairs in each of the 41 sections and 7 regional
workshops for major overhauls.
Z. Enaineerina. Construction and Maintenance
2.14        Zngineering for the road system has generally been prepared by
institutes of the NOT, the main one being the Dosign Institute for Road, Water
and Air Transport (IPTANA). In 1990, these institutes became joint-stock
commercial companies. The stock is still owned by the state but they are
candidates for privatization. Private engineering consultants have also
started work and are competing with the institutes for work by contract. Road
design standards are appropriate to traffic flows and physical
characteristics.
2.15        Construction was done by specialized groups under the HOT, with
some specialization by mode. There were national companies as well as
regional ones for the smaller works. In 1990, these large construction groups
were divided into smaller commerclal companies in a way similar to that
described above for the institutes.



2.16       Maintenance has so far been done entirely by force account.  NRA
will gradually shift more work to contract and has prepared an action plan
with specific targets for shifting selected maintenance activities from force
account to contract over the next five years (Table 8). Technical assistance
and training to assist NRA in shifting work to contract and developing its
capacity for administering the contracts, controlling work quality, etc. is
included in the project. The action plan was reconfirmed at necotiations
(para. 6.01 dl.
2.17       The shift of maintenance to contract will be gradual over a number
of years and some operations will continue to be done by NRA. NRA's equipment
available is overaged and in bad condition; 64% is over 10 years old and 37%
over 15 years old. (Table 9). Some new road maintenance equipment will be
provided under the project. Also, the project will assist NRA to develop
better practices for managing its equipment pool including the setting up of a
charge back system. An action plan was reconfirmed at neaotiations
(para. 6.01 *).
F. Hichwav Expenditures and Financina
2.18       Total road expenditures have been fairly constant between 1985 and
1991, fluctuating between USS260 to 300 million per year. The distribution of
these between the national roads and the rest of the network has also been
stable around 50-50.

Most of the capital expenditures have gone to improving and strengthening
existing roads rather than new construction.  Extensive statistics are kept on
the condition of the roads by section, based on selected measurements
complemented by professional inspections. This permits reliable priority
ranking of needs. Further improvement in the pavement management system will
be obtained by computerization of the data base and introduction of equipment
to measure roughness as well as other pavement characteristics. Required
training and equipment under the project will complement the equipment and
technical assistance financed by iC PHARN.

2.19        The needs for routine and periodic maintenance and the impact of
the project on NRA's budget for the next few years has been assessed
(Table 10). Aareement in principle was reached with MOEF reaardina the 1993
budaet allocation to NRA. For subseauent years adeauate annual consultations
with the Bank have been aareed to ensure that sufficient funds and prioritv
will continue to be aiven to routine and oeriodic maintenance and to the
oroiect and that acceptable criteria will be used to screen investments in
and/or issuina credit auarantees for road proiects. These aareements were
reconfirmed at neaotiations (para. 6.01 f).
III. THE RAILWAY SUBSECTOR
A. Organization and Manacement
3.01        In 1990, the Romanian Railways (SNCFR) were reorganized (Chart 4),
and now have the legal status of a public service corporation (Regis Autonome
in accordance with Law no.15 dated August 7, 1990) which gives them the right
to decentralize economic activities and accelerate the transition to a market-
oriented economy. SNCFR is divided into eight regions and the area of the
port of Constanza. Each region has 3-5 sub-regional units to manage railway
operational activities. The president of the board is assisted by three vice-
presidents (operational, technical and financial). This board is responsible
for determining railway policy, including tariff policy, organization and
operations control.
B. Traffic and Staff Productivity
3.02        The decline of trade with the former CMEA countries, along with
the restructuring of the domestic economy, has contributed to a decrease in
freight traffic over the past three years. Net-ton freight declined by about
53% from 1989 to 1991 and continued to decline in 1992 with the continued
restructuring of the economy. Railway passenger traffic also declined over
this period, from 35.5 to 25.4 billion pass.km., or 30% (for details, see
Table 11). However, in spite of a significant decrease in traffic, staff
productivity compares favorably with most other railways at 320,000 traffic
units per employee. SNCFR recognizes that staff reductions (from the present
197,000) are required. This issue is being examined in the Railway
restructuring study which has just begun, financed under the TACI loan.
C. Railway Propertv
3.03        The SNCFR network is extensive (11,365 route kmo of which 10,893
standard gauge, 427 km narrow and 45 km broad gauge, and 3,721 km, or 33%,
electrified). There are about 1,000 stations and 30 marshalling yards. Track
is generally in poor condition and traffic density is very high on the main
network (10-30 million gross tons per line-track km on the most heavily used
6,000 km).  About 900 km of tracks need to be maintained (capital overhaul)
annually (of which about 500 km with new material), including the same amount
of ballast cleaning. During the last three years average track renewal was



- 11 -
carried out on about 500 km only and the backlog has now reached about 2,000
km. All track maintenance equipment is beyond refurbishment. The principal
reasons for the unsatisfactory track maintenance situation are: the
insufficient number of track machine.; the low technical level and
deterioration of existing machines and their low productivity; and the
increasing number of machines becoming inoperable due to a lack of imported
spare parts. Many existing track machines (tamping and ballast cleaning) date
back to 1964, and 64% are over ten year. old. In 1991, availability was less
than 50%.
3.04        SNCFR owns 2,200 diesel locomotives, 1,061 electric locomotives,
and about 948 steam locomotives (most of which are out of operation). In 1991
SNCFR had over 140,000 freight wagons with a total capacity of 6.4 million
tons, and about 6,500 passenger coaches (Table 11). In the absence of
imported spare parts and material, SNCFR has been particularly expert in
improvising the maintenance of its assets. In aggregate terms, fleet capacity
exceeds expected traffic demand but does not satisfy technical, qualitative
and structural requirements.
3.05        All construction, maintenance and repairs are performed in 28
locomotive sheds, 117 maintenance workshops and depots, 123 sections for
signalling and telecommunication maintenance, 17 regional data processing
centers, and several enterprises for construction and installation works now
in the process of becoming self supporting commercial companies and candidates
for privatization.
3.06        Although about 4,740 km of the open lines are equipped with an
automatic line block-signalling system, about 650 stations still have electro-
dynamic interlocking equipment and 22 marshalling yards are mechanized. Most
of this equipment is technically obsolete for heavily used routes and needs to
be replaced to improve service, reliability and safety. The
telecommunications system on main lines is generally obsolete and should also
be modernized.
3.07        SNCFR runs its operations and financial control systems on two
distinct and incompatible computer networks with heterogeneous hardware from
different generations, comprising: (i) a 16-year-old central UNIVAC 1106
system with a low-speed network covering all border stations. This system has
been modified due to a lack of spare parts and its availability is under 50%
with frequent down time lasting more than an hour; and (ii) a medium-speed
X.25 network of Romanian PDP-11 compatible minicomputers linking all regional
headquarters and some of the more important railway stations. The computers
are 12-14 years old and spare parts have been unavailable for several years.
Availability ranges slightly over 60%.
D. Olerations
3.08        SNCFR's operational performance in 1991 remained relatively high
in spite of a deterioration over the last three years (1989-91) mainly due to
a significant drop in traffic:



- 12 -
-     utilization of electric locomotives (measured by engine-km per
engine day) decreased from 385 to 349 km/day for passenger
services and from 399 to 322 km/day for freight services;
-     utilization of diesel locomotives dropped slightly for the same
reasons;
-     availability of traction and rolling stock which gives an
indication of maintenance efficiency has significantly decreased
since 1989 (electric locomotives decreased from 83% to 68% and
diesel locomotives from 67% to 51%).
3.09        The main reasons for the decline in availability are: (i) a
shortage of spare parts; (ii) a shortage of modern workshop equipment, and
(iii) an inefficient organization and spare part stock control. However,
given the surplus capacity, SNCFR needs to avoid unnecessary maintenance
through scrapping surplus capacity. The installation of a new management
information system (replacing the existing outmoded and inadequate system)
will help improve the railway operation as a whole.
B. The Restructurina Process
3.10        The Government intends to make its railway system market oriented
by: (i) improving railway efficiency by establishing its future role and size
based on overall economic efficiency criteria and competition with other
transport modes; (ii) reducing or eliminating budgetary drains; and
(iii) minimizing the adverse social effects of necessary staff reductions.
The Government and SNCFR have begun the reform process by launching a
restructuring study (by DR-Consult-Germany) and in parallel by taking urgent
cost-reduction measures to improve SNCFR'c financial situation. SNCFR has
already taken the following cost-reduction measures: (i) staff reductions of
about 1,000 employees per month; (ii) closure of five marshalling yards and
about 50 stations; (iii) separation from SNCFR of 21 workshops and other non-
basic activities together with appropriate facilities and employees; and
(iv) revaluation of assets (to be applied on January 1, 1993) which will
increase the railway depreciation funds approximately tenfold. The project
addresses urgent needs in track maintenance and data processing required to
arrest further deterioration of the system. The proposed items are only
partial replacement of existing equipment urgently needed for priority
maintenance and traffic safety and would be essential in a restructured
railway.
IV. THE PROJZCT
A. Proiect Obiectives
4.01        The objectives of the project are to: (a) increase efficiency of
the sector and accommodate expected changes in transport demand by improving
the condition of the road network; (b) promote the selection of transport
investments on the basis of economic criteria; (c) improve fiscal performance



- 13 -
and reduce the uneconomic use of transport and energy by implementing a cost-
based system of road user charges; (d) develop the execution of road works by
contract; (e) build on transport policy initiatives under the TACI project
particularly with regard to investment selection and restructuring of the
railways; and (f) support the economic reform program and encourage social
stability by financing geographically dispersed efficient employment
generation including in newly privatizing contracting companies to the extent
feasible.
B. Proiect Descriotion
4.02        The proposed project is based on the NRA's 1993-95 rehabilitation
and pavement strengthening program. Implementation of civil works started
during these years would spread over a 3-5 year period. The proposed project
components would consist of high priority items of this program.
Specifically:
(a)   the road rehabilitation component (77% of project cost) includes
the rehabilitation of about 1,100 km of national roads (Table 12).
The sections to be rehabilitated have daily traffic ranging from
2,000 to 10,000 vehicles per day and are mostly on major east-west
itineraries across Romania. The rehabilitation projects follow
existing vertical and horizontal alignments and include
strengthening of the existing pavements where existing ones have
exceeded their design life and are close to failure, widening of
shoulders, improvement of drainage system (side ditches, culverts,
bridges), construction of climbing lanes and removal of black
spots;
(b)   the border croosinac comoonent (2% of project cost) includes
upgrading six main crossing border posts e.g. Ukraine, Hungary,
Bulgaria, to ensure adequate flow of international road traffic;
(c)   the road safety comoonent (4% of project cost) includes the
signaling (international vertical traffic signs) and horizontal
marking (central axis and the two border lines, and auxiliary
pedestrian and vehicle marking) of 5,000 km of roads to improve
information and safety levels on the network. These 5,000 km
represent the total length of the designated "European Roads" in
Romania, and signalling and marking will be done in accordance
with European standards. Each road link would be improved to
international standards of safety;
(d)   the materials and eouioment comoonent (9% of project cost)
includes purchase of imported materials such as bitumen to cover
NRA's expected deficit for the 1993-95 strengthening program of
secondary national roads. It also includes equipment for routine
maintenance, traffic monitoring, vehicle inspection and training,
such as multi purpose maintenance vehicles, small asphalt milling
machines and manual compactor., snow removal equipment, bridge
inspection vehicles, weigh bridges, traffic counting and
laboratory equipment (Table 13);



- 14 -
(e)   the technical assistance and trainino com2onent (1  of project
cost) includes some 60 man-months of technical assistance in axle
load control, equipment management and maintenance work by
contract. Over 100 managerial and technical staff will be trained
in various countries on the following major topics: economic and
environmental analyses, design standards and computer assisted
design, pavement management, contract and equipment management,
supervision of works and quality control and budgeting, cost
accounting and control (Table 14).
(f)   the railway comoonent  (7% of project cost) includes some urgently
needed track maintenance and data procesuing equipment and spare
parts, required under any scenario of railway restructuring, and
related training in various countries of about 50 manmonths on the
following topics: management strategy and railway restructuring,
marketing and accounting, computerization, engineering, operations
and financial analysis (Table 14).
C. Enoineerina and Status of Progect Preoaration
4.03        Detailed engineering and feasibility studies for all project road
sections were completed or are being completed by NRA/IPTANA, with costs
updated to December 1992. The road sections were selected on the basis of an
analysis of the pavement condition of 13,000 km of national roads and with a
view to rehabilitate major national and international itineraries. Designs
for the improvement of the six border posts are still being prepared. They
will be reviewed prior to execution. The designs for the road safety program,
i.e.,signalling and marking of 5,000 km of European roads of the Romanian
network, are complete. The prequalification of contractors has been completed
and the bidding document for civil works have been agreed with NRA. Those for
goods and equipment are in an advanced stage of preparation by NRA, RAR and
SNCFR. Terms of reference for supervision of civil works have been agreed
with NRA (Annex 1).
D. Cost Estimates
4.04        The estimated cost of the project, including contingencies,
amounts to US$405.0 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of
US$271.0 million or about 67% of the total cost. The costs of the different
components are given below.

4.05        Construction cost estimates are based on quantities from final
engineering designs and on NRA/IPTANA estimates of December 1992 unit rates in
US$ checked against recent contract prices in similar projects under
implementation in other countries. A detailed analysis of costs has been made
to determine the foreign exchange component, local costs, duties and taxes.
Taxes amount to 60% of the local cost component.
4.06        Costs of technical assistance (TA) to NRA (60 manmonths including
TA for road maintenance by contractor) are based on an average cost of
US$15,000 per manmonth (m/m) while cost for the supervision of the civil works
has been estimated at less than 4% of the total construction cost. Costs of
materials and equipment are based on the latest acquisitions by NRA and SNCFR,
including some purchases under the TACI project. These costs are in line with
those in similar ongoing operations in neighbor countries. Cost for training
abroad of NRA staff (180 m/m) is estimated at US$5,500 per m/m, taking into
account that the trainee travel costs would be relatively low being mostly
within Europe.
4.07        A physical contingency of 5% has been included  for all components
to cover possible increases in quantities. This amount is appropriate given
the precise engineering designs already available for all civil works except
those of the six international border posts. Price contingencies have been
applied to base costs following the Bank guidelines as follows:
Year         1993  1994  199   129  1222  1998
Local %         43    15   10       5    5      5

E. Proiect Financina
4.08        The Borrower will be Romania with onlending to NRA, RAR and SNCFR
for their components. The proposed Bank loan of US$120.0 million equivalent
would finance about 30% of the total project cost. This includes about
US$9 million of local cost financing for the road rehabilitation component and
its supervision. This is justified since, without it, we would finance only
14% of the civil works and therefore be unable to participate meaningfully in
the process of contracting out road works for the first time in Romania.
Another 40% of project cost, US$160.0 million equivalent, will be financed by
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the European
Investment Bank (EIB) which have agreed to providing loans of US$80.0 million
each. The remaining US$125.0 million equivalent would be financed by the
Government. During neootiations the Government confirmed that it would meet
all local cost includino cost overruns, and any shortfall in foreign exchanoeL
4.09        In accordance with the above, a financing plan, including the
parallel US$160 million cofinanciers' participation in the
construction/supervision of civil works, and in the purchase of equipment, is
as follows:

F.  Imolementation and Monitorina
4.10       The proposed US$120.0 million equivalent loan would be made to
Romania. The project would be implemented by NRA, RAR and the railway
component by SNCFR. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be maintained by
NRA. Its members will include a Chairman and seven representatives in
managerial positions of: (i) NRA's Department of Constructionj (ii) NRA's
Department of Maintenancel (iii) NRA's Department of Equipment and Materials;
(iv) NRA's Procurement Division; (v) NRA's Economic Department; (vi) SNCFR;
and (vii) RAR. The PMU will have a secretary provided by NRA with throe
permanent staff. For its part of the project, SNCFR has established a project
management team (PMT) including a chairman and three high officials, one for
each sub-component of the project. The chairman would be the member of the
PMU. The PMU would review and follow up on procurement procedures and bidding
documents, monitor and coordinate every aspect of project implementation and
assemble, in quarterly reports, all project implementation information. The
PMU will also be responsible for liaising with and coordinating all the
cofinanciers, project tasks and keeping direct contact with their supervision
missions. Terms of Reference for the PMU were agreed and are in Annex 2.
Durina necotiations. the Government reconfirmed that the PMU will remain in
ooeration and fully staffed throuahout the oroiect execution loara. 6.01 a).
4.11       NRA would be the executing agency directly responsible for the
execution of the road rehabilitation, improvement of the six international
borders, and signalling and marking works by private contractors. Consultants



- 18 -
would be employed to assist NRA in supervision of civil works. The terms of
reference are in Annex 1. Acquisition of NRA's materials and equipment,
selection of TA to NRA and the NRA/IPTANA staff training program would be
under NRA's direct responsibility, following approval by the Bank of proposed
specialized experts and training programs. Procurement of vehicle testing
equipment will be done by RAR. The railway component would be directly
executed by SNCFR under the PMU's monitoring.
4.12        The restart of the Bank's transport activity in Romania following
several years of inactivity, and under totally new circumstances, results in a
lack of reliable implementation profiles for the road rehabilitation works
which is the component determining the period of implementation of the
project. These works are planned to start during the first and second year of
project implementation and once started would take about two years to
complete. With loan effectiveness expected in the third quarter of 1993,
project implementation would start in late 1993. Acquisition and delivery of
NRA's and SNCFR's equipment would be completed in the first three years of
project implementation. TA and training would extend for three years. The
project's implementation schedule is shown in Table 15. The proposed loan
would close on December 31, 1998, six months after the projected project
completion date of June 30, 1998. Proposed monitoring indicators for the
preparation of PMU's quarterly reports have been agreed with NRA and SNCFR.
During negotiations. agreement was confirmed on the Droiect implementation
schedule. monitoring criteria, and reporting arranaements loara. 6.01 h).
G. Procurement
4.13        Procurement arrangements of Bank financed project elements are
summarized below. Procurement would be made in accordance with the Bank's
procurement guidelines for all Bank-financed items. The civil works and
equipment components, cofinanced in parallel by the Bank, EBRD and EIB, would
be procured through International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures with
tendering for their respective contracts open to contractors of the Bank's,
EBRD's, and EIB's eligible countries.

4.14        Civil works contracts for roads rehabilitation (about 1,100 km;
US$300 million), the improvement of the six international border crossings
(US$9.5 million), and road signalling and marking (5,000 km; US$16.7 million)
would be let through ICB among prequalified contractors. Road rehabilitation
contracts (Table 12) range from US$5 to $38 million with an average size of
US$20 million. Prequalification has been completed and its results approved
by the Bank. Recently formed Romanian commercial companies specializing in
road construction have formed joint ventures with well experienced and
capitalized foreign firms and have been prequalified. They are expected to be
competitive with their new financial status, former construction experience,
good knowledge of the country, and low salary costs. The implementation
schedule is in Table 15. Bidding for civil works is expected to start in
March 1993 with contract awards in June/July 1993.
4.15        The materials (bitumen and additivesl US$10.4 million) and
equipment (US$26.0 million) for NRA and RAR would be procured under ICB with
post-qualification of bidders. Goods manufactured in Romania will be granted
a preference of 15% or related duties whichever is less provided that the
value added in Romania is more than 20%. However, contracts for materials and
equipment not exceeding US$300,000 each, would be procured by International
Shopping (IS) based on the comparison of price quotations from three different
eligible countries. The total aggregate value of IS would not exceed
US$400,000 for bitumen, US$2.0 million for NRA's equipment and USS1.0 million
for RAR's equipment. Equipment for SNCFR (US$26.7 million) track maintenance
with spare parts and for data processing would be procured under ICB. The
general parts of the bidding documents for goods approved and used for the
procurement of electronic data processing equipment under the TACI project
will be used for this project also.
4.16        Consultants services for supervision of civil works estimated at
some 4% of construction costs (US$13 million), and for technical assistance,
and training, would be carried out by qualified and experienced consultants
appointed in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants
except for contracts estimated to cost less than US$100,000 equivalent. For
supervision it is envisaged that foreign consultants would mainly provide
managerial capabilities and local consultants will carry out the actual work.
Local consultants have demonstrated their competence during project
preparation. Training programs are described in Table 14.
4.17        All contracts exceeding US$300,000 (over 99% of total project
cost) would be subject to prior review and approval by the Bank. Other
contracts will be reviewed by supervision missions. For civil work contracts,
supervising consultants will be assisting NRA in evaluating tenders and
preparing final civil works contracts. Procurement information will be
included in the quarterly project progress reports agreed with the borrower.

4.19        Withdrawal applications for contracts above US$300,000 would be
fully documented and for contracts valued at US$300,000 or less would be made
on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOB). Durina neootiations
acreement was reached that documentation to suooort exoenditures financed
under SOEs would be maintained by the Borrower and made available for review
by Bank suoervision missions, in addition to beina audited annually by
auditors acceotable to the Bank (oara. 6.01 ii.
4.20        A schedule of disbursements is given in Table 16.  Since NRA's
disbursement performance (up to mid-1980s when Bank discontinued operations in
Romania) has been satisfactory and above average, actual disbursements may be
faster than estimated. The Loan Agreement provides for retroactive financing
for supervising consultants contracts entered into by NRA after March 1, 1993,
in an amount not to exceed US$250,000. To facilitate disbursements, the
Bank's share of the project would be financed through a Special Account. The
authorized allocation for the Special Account would be US$7.0 million,
equivalent to about four months of project foreign expenditures (financed by
the loan) during the five-year project implementation period. Funds for goods
(equipment and materials) would be withdrawn by the Borrower from the Special
Account after approval of the ICB or IS procedures and related contract awards
by the Bank. Replenishment for technical assistance, and for consultants for

construction supervision, would be made on the basis of appropriate
documentation. Replenishment of the Special Account would follow Bank
procedures. The Special Account would be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit report would be submitted to the
Bank for review and approval within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
Durina negotiations. aoreement was reached on the establishment. oDeration.
and auditina of the Svecial Account (para. 6.01 ki.
I. Proiect Supervision
4.21        Three two-week Bank supervision misuions per year during the first
two to three years of project implementation would be needed to supervise all
project activities. The missions would be staffed by a civil engineer and one
economist, responsible for all engineering and economic aspects of the
project; they should be longer in 1994 and 1995 when review and clearance of
road sections to be contracted, and discussions on the technical assistance
items would be most frequent. Sufficient time should also be allowed to review
contract documents and specifications for the varied equipment to be procured
under the project. A railway expert would be required for about four weeks
annually to advise on the purchase of railway equipment and supervise the
restructuring study. After 1995, with all project. items under execution, the
participation of the economist can be shorter. One mission in 1998 would
carry out the final wrap-up project supervision and would prepare the Project
Completion Report (PCR). In sum, the proposed project would require about 18
staff weeks in FY94 and FY95 and 14 staff weeks in FY96 to FY98.
J. Environment ImDact
4.22        The project has been classified as "BR for purposes of O.D. 4.01
on Environmental Assessment, meaning that only limited environmental review is
required. The civil works are primarily confined to improvements on existing
roads. These improvements would protect the areas adjacent to every road from
erosion through the construction of side drains, cross drainage structures and
retaining walls, would provide a comfortable and clean asphalt riding surface,
and would eliminate accident black points. Conditions along the roads would
be better through reduction of dust, noise, water ponding and erosion, and
elimination of safety hazards. No population resettlement would be necessary
since the works would be inside the existing right of way. The project would
not affect any archaeological or historical site. Contractors under the
clauses of the bidding documents are responsible for maintaining worksites
pollution free, returning sites to their original condition, and equip asphalt
plants and crushers with dust collectors. They are also responsible for
notification of any problem related to unknown historical sites. The terms of
reference of the consultants which will supervise the works expressly refer to
ensuring that environment protection provisions as set out in the contractual
documents are respected.
K. Accounts and Audit
4.23        Separate accounts would be used to record all project funds
(Government local funds and Bank loan foreign funds) expenditures. These



- 23 -
accounts, including the SOEs as well as the Special Account would be audited
each year by auditor(s) acceptable to the Bank. The accounts and the
auditor's report thereon would be received in the Bank within six months of
the end of the fiscal year.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Benefits and Beneficiaries
5.01        The project is expected to play an important role in accommodating
the economic reorientation of transport demand to road transport and start
restructuring the railways accordingly. Quantifiable benefits will be in the
form of reduced vehicle operating costs (VOC), i.e. lower fuel consumption,
tire wear and general vehicle maintenance costs, time and wage savings. Also,
the present value of road expenditures will be reduced by undertaking road
strengthening now and avoiding more expensive reconstruction at a later date.
Road maintenance expenditures will also decrease on rehabilitated and
strengthened roads. The road safety component will contribute to the
reduction in accidents. The benefits will accrue to a large and widespread
number of beneficiaries. Lower road transport costs and time savings will
benefit vehicle owners as well as users.
B. Costs and Benefits
5.02        NRA/IPTANA has prepared feasibility studies for all road sections
to be rehabilitated under the project. They have also analyzed 13,000 km of
national roads to establish priorities for the rehabilitation program. All
costs and benefits were evaluated in constant December 1992 prices. Financial
costs and prices have been converted to economic prices. Traffic growth rates
have been assumed at 4% p.a. for freight vehicles and 2% p.a. for cars and
buses. VOC have been estimated using the Bank's HDM model; the unit VOCs are
summarized in Table 17. Road roughness coefficients have been estimated based
on engineer's evaluation of the road surface. Time savings were valued at the
predominant wage rates for drivers, no time savings value was inputed for
passengers. The economic rates of return (ERR) calculated over an assumed 15
year service life, range from 23 to 66% for roads to be rehabilitated under
the project (Table 12). 
5.03        The proposed list of equipment to be procured was agreed based on
an evaluation of the total equipment required for NRA's maintenance operations
taking into account those activities that would be shifted to contract work
according to the agreed action plan. These requirements have been compared
with the present fleet, its condition and the need to scrap overaged and
inefficient equipment. All the proposed equipment is for routine maintenance.
5.04        It is more difficult to estimate the economic return of road
safety components, but it is proven that horizontal marking such as center and
side lines reduce accidents significantly.
5.05        Railway track maintenance equipment and ballast cleaning machines
produced mostly in Romania are old and of obsolete technology. Their



- 24 -
availability is lss that 50% and the result is a rapidly deteriorating track
even on main lines. There are speed restrictions on a large part of the
network. The acquisition of 8 ballast cleaning machines and spare parts for
existing machines would improve the technical level of over 2,000 trak-km per
year while increasing technical speed from 64 to 84 km/h with annual savings
estimated up to US$5 million. The IRR for these machines is estimated at 29%.
The replacement of deteriorated data processing and communications equipment
will prevent a costly breakdown of the system. It would also reduce billing
errors, reduce expenditures on foreign cars used and better control 6,000
private freight cars and payments for their rent and maintenance. The IRR for
this equipment is estimated at 22%.
C. Overall Evaluation and Risks
5.06        Project risks are low.  The GOR, NOT and NRA have expressed strong
interest in the project, and are likely to proceed even in the event of
political changes. The main risk is that the GOR would not have sufficient
counterpart funds. However, the local component of US$125 million would be
affordable. It would amount annually over the project implementation period
to one third of total highway expenditures budgeted for 1992. NRA has also
agreed that local funds would have to come from its regular budget allocation
without additionality because of the project.  This was confirmed also by
MOEF.
VI  AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01        During negotiations, agreements were reconfirmed on the following:
a)    implementation of a system of road user charges within one year of
completion in mid-1993 of the road user charges study financed
under the TACI Project (Loan 3363-RO) (para. 1.10);
b)    an action plan to collect data and revise present legislation on
axle load control (para. 2.09);
c)    the preparation of a plan to improve road safety (para. 2.10);
d)    an action plan for shifting selected maintenance activities from
force accounts to contract with quantified targets over the next
five years (para. 2.16);
*)    an action plan for better management practices including a charge
back system, for NRA's equipment pool (para. 2.17);
f)    joint review in advance of each year's total highway expenditures
and criteria for investing in and/or issuing credit guarantees for
road projects (para. 2.19);



- 25 -
g)    continuation throughout project implementation of the Project
Management Unit (para. 4.10);
h)    the reporting procedures for the project (para. 4.12);
i)    the procurement procedures, including bidding documents for civil
works and equipment and selection of consultants for supervision,
Technical Assistance and Training (para. 4.17);
j)    the documentation supporting expenditures financed under SOBs and
its annual auditing (para. 4.19);
k)    the procedures for the Special Account (para. 4.20);
6.02        Based upon the above assurances and agreement, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$120 million equivalent to the Republic of
Romania for a 17 year term including a 5-year grace period.

ROAI) REHABTLITATION PROGRAM
SUPERVISION OF WORKS
Terms of Reference
A.    BACKGROUND
1.    The Government of Romania has requested loans from three International
Financial Institutions (IFI), namely, the World Bank, the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, and the European Investment Bank, for financing
a program of road rehabilitation of selected priority sections of the National Road
Network. The National Road Administration (NRA) of the Ministry of Transport
(MOT) would be responsible for supervision of the works to be carried out by
prequalified civil works contractors through International Competitive Bidding
(ICB).
B.    BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
2.    The works to be carried out ("the Works") include road improvements such
as pavement reconstruction, pavement overlays, widening, shoulder strengthening,
side drains, and, in some instances, retaining walls, in the sections specified in the
Attachment to these Terms of Reference. The rehabilitated pavement consists of
asphalt mixture, binder and asphalt concrete. The work also includes gravel sub-
base, stabilised gravel base and surface treatment where shoulder have to be
widened. The length, estimated cost, starting year, and period of construction are
detailed in Attachment 1 together with the names of the international financing
institution for each contract. The implementation period of the program would be
forty two (42) months with individual contractual periods varying between twelve
(12) and thirty six (36) months. The maintenance guarantee period for every
contract would be twelve (12) months.
3.    The GOR has decided to use part of the proceeds of the loans to engage
qualified consultants ("the Supervision Consultants") with satisfactory international
experience in supervising works similar in size and nature to the Works to provide
services to the NRA on pre-construction activities, construction supervision and
maintenance monitoring of the Works. The detailed engineering report of the
projects together with the bidding documents were prepared by the Design Institute
for Roads Water and Air Transport (IPTANA). The Works will be done under the
supervision of the Supervision Consultant acting as 'Engineer's Representative" as
per bidding documents definition with NRA acting as 'Engineer" as per bidding
documents definition, for approval of certain actions.

C.    OBJlECTIVES
4.    The objectives of the services are:
(a)   to assist NRA for pre-construction activities including tendering
phase, evaluation of tenders and preparation of final civil works
contracts;
(b)   to supervise the Works, approve the materials, equipment and
workmanship;
(c)   to ensure proper accounting and recording of the progress of the
Works; and
(d)   to provide on-the-job training to selected NRA staff in contract
management and supervision.
5.    The Supervision Consultant will exercise every reasonable and possible
effort to protect the interests of NRA and to avoid the occurrence of disorders and
vice of construction during the works. To this end, the Supervision Consultant shall
ensure the supervision and control of on-going works by its engineers and
technicians in a timely manner, The Supervision Consultant, however, will not be
responsible for the incapacity of the contractor to properly implement the works.
6.    Responsibility. If the Supervision Consultant is a joint-venture or an
association of a qualified international consultant and a local consultant, leadership
of the joint-venture shall be the responsibility of the qualified international
consultant and it shall provide the key supervision personnel (at least a resident
project manager and a quality control expert); the balance of the staff may be
contributed by the other firm.
7.    Training of Local Personnel. For purposes of training local personnel and
for such personnel to acquire experience, the central and regional units of NRA may
second staff up to the level of chief-engineer in their current position to work with
the Supervision Consultant. The level and number of the NRA staff accepted on
secondment will be determined by the Supervision Consultant on the basis of the
size of the sub-projects. The Supervision Consultant will select the seconded staff
from a list of qualified nominees offered by the central or regional units of the
NRA. The Supervision Consultant will bear the salaries of the seconded staff;
however, the seconded staff will enjoy the same conditions as the Supervision
Consultant's other local staff. The Supervision Consultant will decide what
responsibilities and function to assign to the seconded staff, and will have the right
to ask to have replaced any seconded staff.
