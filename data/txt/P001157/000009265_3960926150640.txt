Project Description:         The objectives of the project are to reverse the
deterioration which has taken place in the Abidjan
environRent because of the dumping of urban wastes
and industrial effluents into the Ebrie lagoon
bys (a) building waste water disposal facilities;
(b) establishing sound environmental legislation;
(c) monitoring pollution; and (d) ensuring the
sustainability of the sewerage system. The
project consists of the extension of an existing
interceptor and secondary and tertiary sewers, the
construction of an ocean outfall to bypass the
lagoon and to diecharge wastes into the ocean,
studies and training. Project elements comprise
(a) a 6.5 km-long interceptor; (b) 26 km of
sewers; (c) eight pumping stations and ten septage
discharge stations; (d) a sand trap; (e) a
floatable removal plant; (f) a 1.2 km long ocean
outfall/diffuser and (g) a pilot sanitation system
in a slum area. Studies include feasibility and
design of project works, a comprehensive, phased,
master plan of the Abidjan sanitation, drainage
and environmental protection system and design of
a follow-up project. Training for the staff
responsible for implementation of the project
would also be carried out.
Project Benefits and Riskss  The main benefits of the project stem from the
restoration of ecological conditions of the Ebrie
lagoon and from the economic and environmental
losses which would thus be avoided. No technical
risk is associated with the project. A possible
risk would be that delays in the financial
restructuring of the water supply sub-sector would
limit resources available to the sewerage and
drainage sub-sector. This risk, however, is
limited in view of the impressive commitment
towards the sector adjustment program already
demonstrated by the Government.

The benefits of the sectoral adjustment program are substantial and
would not only lead to more efficient management of the water supply
sub-sector, but would introduce a more rational approach to the
management, financing and pricing policy of the sewerage and
environmental sub-sectors. Thus, it would reinforce and complement the
objectives of the proposed project.
6.          Actions aRreed upons These fall into two categories.
Firstly, during negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
actions to be adopted by the Governments
(a)   to enforce new legislation concerning permits of discharge
of industrial liquid wastes so that the sewerage system can
handle improved wastes upon completion of project works; the
new legislation should provide for fines and penalties for
non-compliance;
(b)   to enforce new legislation compelling companies and
individuals now dumping septage into the lagoon to dump it
into the septage discharge stations provided for that
purpose, upon completion of project works; this legislation
should provide for fines and penalties for non-compliance;
(c) to cause the pollution control laboratory of MDM and CRO to
carry out the ocean and lagoon monitoring program starting
no later than June 30, 1990;
(d)   to entrust the operation and maintenance of the project
works to a private operator in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Bank;
Ce)   to cause SODECI to collect the water surcharge as part of
the water bills and promptly transfer these amounts to FNE
in accordance with the provisions of the concession
contract; the Treasury will promptly transfer the proceeds
of the sanitation tax to FIE;
(f)   to cause the inventory of assets in the Abidjan sewerage and
drainage system to be updated and revalued on a notional
basis under DCGTx's supervision;
(g)   to cause the FNE's accounts to be audited at the end of each
fiscal year by external auditors acceptable to the Bank;
(h)   to cause the sanitation tax to continue being earmarked as a
resource of FNE;
(i)   to cause a part of the surcharge equivalent to the annual
service requirements of the debt previously managed by the
former FNA to be allocated to the sewerage and drainage sub-
sector; and
(J)   to cause the annual revenues of the sub-sector to be at
least equivalent to the annual operating costs, including a



- 4 -
provision for depreciation calculated on revalued assets in
service of the Abidjan sewerage and drainage system.
Secondly, the fulfillment of all conditions pursuant to the initial
disbursement of the ESB Loan Agreement would be a condition of
effectiveness.
7.          Justification and benefits. Major beneficiaries of the
reduced pollution levels would be fisheries (both in lagoon and sea
waters as the lagoon is a nursery zone for shellfish and seafish),
aquaculture, residents in the vicinity of the lagoon, and potential
recreational users of the lagoon. Industries would benefit from a
least-cost alternative for waste disposal by discharging directly into
the interceptor without having to install expensive pre-treatment
facilities. Also, an estimated 100,000 households In the poorer segment
of Abidjan's population (corresponding to some 550,000 people) relying
on leaching pits and septic tanks would benefit from improved septage
pumping services. As the project will allow safe disposal of all
domestic wastes, whatever the household sanitation mode, the whole
pqpulation of Abidjan would benefit from a part of the physical
facilities such as the outfall/diffuser, sand trap, floatable removal
plant and pumping station.
8.          Risks. The project would not pose technical risks.
Construction of an oil sealine in the same area as planned for the
outfall has proven successful. Execution of other physical components
is considered straightforward. Operation and maintenance of project
works would be carried out by a private operator. A possible risk could
be that delays in the financial restructuring of the water supply sub-
sector would limit resources available to the sewerage and drainage sub-
sector. This risk, however, is limited in view of the impressive
commitment towards the sector adjustment program already demonstrated by
the Government.
9.          Recommendations: I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the IBRD and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
