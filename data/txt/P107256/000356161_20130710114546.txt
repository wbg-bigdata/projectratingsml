H. Restructuring (if any)
Component 7 (provision of long-lasting anti-malarial nets) was restructured on August 30, 2008
as a result of a proposal for the construction of a Centre for Disease Control on the basis that
other agencies had already distributed anti-malarial bed-nets and there was a clear need for
improving disease control in the State. Component 5 (Rural Livelihoods Component) was
restructured to enhance its coverage and depth upon the approval of Additional Financing of
US$3 million by the MDTF Oversight Committee (OC) on June 29, 2010.



I. Disbursement Profile
1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1      Context at Appraisal
1.      The Blue Nile Start-up Emergency Project (BNSEP) is one of the interventions flowing from the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) that is directed at improving basic services, consolidating peace
and maintaining stability in conflict-affected areas of Sudan. These interventions focus on three conflict-
affected areas in northern Sudan, namely: South Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Abyei. The BNSEP was
approved by the Oversight Committee (OC) for the MDTF-N on March 12, 2007. The Grant Agreement
was signed on May 25, 2008 and became effective on July 14, 2008. The Project was to be implemented
over a period of 23 months and close on June 30, 2011. It was later granted Additional Financing (AF),
extending its closing date to June 30, 2012.
2.      The project became effective three years after signing of the CPA when Sudan was embarking on
a slow transition from managing conflict to pursuing pro-poor development. This transition was
characterized by high needs, limited and uneven capacity, and on-going security and stabilization risks.
3.       The 2005 CPA made a provision for 70% of National Development Reconstruction Funds to be
targeted to the least developed states in North Sudan; this reflected the urgent recovery and development
needs of these areas, as well as their pivotal role in sustained peace and security. Within this group of
least developed states, the particular status of the three areas (Blue Nile, Abyei, and South Kordofan) was
recognized in the CPA through specific protocols, which establish a special status under the Presidency
for Abyei, and provide the Blue Nile and South Kordofan states with their own constitution and
legislative bodies.
4.      The first Sudan Consortium, held in Paris on March 9-10, 2006, noted that since the signing of
the CPA, the three transitional areas had not received the expected resources, thus aggravating the
existing political instability in the region. The quick formulation and start-up of a recovery project –
including quick impact interventions – were both expected and desired.
5.      When the BNSEP became effective, implementation of the CPA in all three areas was behind
schedule. Internally Displaced People (IDPs) were returning to Blue Nile State and humanitarian and
development agencies were scaling up activities. Opportunities for households to invest more in
agriculture had increased, and there was a significant rise in food and cash income derived mainly from
the benefits of increased stability and movement. However, there remained significant disparities between
the three areas and the national average, and significant internal disparities between more and less war-
affected areas.
1.2. Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators
6.       The Project Development Objective (PDO) was: to initiate the recovery of basic infrastructure
and social services provided to the poor people in the conflict-affected area of the Blue Nile State and to
lay the foundations for a program addressing capacity building needs in key state Ministries in order to
ensure future improvements in service delivery especially at local (decentralized) level.

7.       The key performance indicators at time of approval were:

1.3 Revised PDO, Key Indicators, and Justification
8.       The PDO has remained unchanged throughout the lifetime of the project. Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) were originally formulated during the Project Proposal Stage and presented clustered
under three sectors in alignment with the MDTF-N Three Areas Strategy. These indicators were re-
articulated and reflected in project documentation, and reported on by the Monitoring Agent (MA).
9.        Component 7 (provision of long-lasting anti-malarial nets) was replaced with a proposal for the
construction of a Centre for Disease Control on the basis that other agencies had already distributed anti-
malarial bed-nets and there was a clear need for improving disease control in the State. KPIs were revised
to fit the new component.
10.      KPIs were further adjusted in compliance with the mandatory Core Indicators, and subsequently
to include appropriate indicators for approval of the Additional Financing (AF) to expand and deepen the
rural livelihoods component (building and expanding upon the activities in the original grant, enlarging
coverage, diversifying livelihoods, and maximizing development impact). This took place when the AF
was proposed and was approved by the MDTF OC on June 29, 2010. It was approved by the Bank on
August 25, 2010.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
11.     The main beneficiaries of the project (direct and indirect) are the general and conflict-affected
population of Blue Nile State.



                                                                2
1.5 Original Project Components
12.     The original project components outlined in the Final Project Proposal (FPP) are:
13.     Component 1: Water Supply (US$2.775 million – Implementing Agency: UNICEF). It
supported the construction and rehabilitation of improved water sources throughout Blue Nile State, with
the objective of increasing access to potable water on a reasonable per capita per day rate (20 liters), as
well as increasing awareness on hygiene and environmental issues for 71,000 IDPs, returnees and
host/receiving community members.
14.     Component 2: Rural Roads Maintenance and Spot Improvements (US$3.725 million). It
supported the construction of eight small one-lane bridges and 10 box culverts, as well as the clearing of
60 km and grading of 20 km of roads. It also provided capacity building as staff from the Blue Nile State
Ministry of Physical Planning and Public Utilities (MPPPU) participated in all phases of the project.
Purchase of some equipment was also included in the component: two trucks, six vehicles (4x4), one
tanker, one excavator, and one grader. Furthermore, the MPPPU would also rehabilitate two trucks, one
bulldozer (D8), one grader, and one tanker.
15.      Component 3: Basic Education (US$2.780 million – Implementing Agency: UNICEF). It
funded student and teacher kits, and classroom equipment for primary schools. It made basic education
more accessible through the provision of a variety of interventions targeting school infrastructure and
access to water, latrines, and basic hygiene. The Component also built the capacity of 1,300 teachers and
established the Focusing Resources on Effective School Health (FRESH) program in 30 schools.
16.      Component 4: Demining (US$1.599 million – Implementing Agency: NMAC). The National
Mine Action Center (NMAC) implemented this component as part of its urgently needed work on
demining suspected roads and other high priority suspected areas in Blue Nile State. Where possible,
registered and accredited local mine action NGOs undertook clearance operations for mines, Unexploded
Ordinances (UXO) and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW).
17.      Component 5: Rural Households Livelihood Support (US$0.380 million – Implementing
Agency: UNIDO). As a result of the successful implementation of the Community Livelihoods and Rural
Industry Support (CLARIS) Program – Phase I (TF/SUD/03/001) in South Kordofan, UNIDO was asked
to extend its CLARIS Program to Blue Nile State. The Project was implemented using the existing
UNIDO CLARIS Phase I resources and staff in operations as a Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) in
Dilling (South Kordofan) since 2004. The sub-office made use of support staff already available to carry
out the selection and organization of target group training as required, employ existing blacksmiths for the
production of hand tools, and utilize its facility for the production of the Nuba hoes and ox carts.
18.       Component 6: Capacity Building for State and Local Government (US$2.310 million). It
supported the Blue Nile State Government’s capacity in financial management and procurement and
included: (i) institutional assessment and formulation of follow-up programs in Finance and Economy,
Local Government, Education, Physical Planning and Public Utilities, and (ii) construction of basic office
facilities and housing for local authorities.
19.      Component 7: Anti-Malaria Bed-nets (US$0.400 million). While not included in the MDTF
Three Areas Strategy, it was included in the project because of its potential high impact and quick start-up.
It was to include the marketing and distribution of 65,000 long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs).
20.      Component 8: Project Coordination Unit (US$0.640 million). This Component funded
technical assistance for the coordination of the project. This included establishing a PCU within the State
Ministry of Finance and Economy (MoFNE). A group of consultants with accounting, procurement and
project management expertise were recruited to work together with a group of appointed young MoFNE
staff to operate the PCU.

1.6 Revised Components
21.     Component 7: The Ministry later rejected the project as out of line with the priorities of the State,
because LLINs were already being sourced through other channels. Instead, the Ministry requested
funding for the establishment of a Centre for Disease Control (CDC), which was approved by the PCU.
The construction of the Centre was financed through the MDTF, with furniture and equipment provided
by the Unity State Fund (USF). The CDC opened in March 2011.
1.7 Other Significant Changes
22.      Additional Financing of US$3 million was approved by the MDTF OC on June 29, 2010 and
became effective on April 17, 2011 as a supplemental grant to the GoNU to enhance the coverage and
depth of the Rural Livelihoods Component. Under the AF, the Rural Livelihoods Component was
restructured into two sub-components. The delay in effectiveness was largely due to Bank procedures
which treat AF as a new project with a different project ID and a different TF number.
23.     Sub-component 1: Enhancing Coverage of Existing Rural Livelihoods Program (US$0.4
million). The AF was devoted to strengthening the existing program under the Rural Livelihoods
Component and to meet the high demand which could not be met as a result of the low allocation (only
US$0.38) for this component. An additional US$0.4 million was to be set aside for additional coverage of
applicant beneficiaries and scaling up the packages. Activities included under this sub-component were:
(i) improved seeds consultancy (US$30,190); and (ii) procurement of improved seeds (US$220,337).
24.     Sub-component 2: Strengthening and Modernization of the Artisanal Fisheries for
Fisherman Fishing in the Nile River (US$2.1 million). It included: (i) targeting fishers and women
engaged in artisanal fisheries (US$0.4 million) to support training in better practices, supply fisher unions
with improved boats and fishing nets, improve local boat/net supply by training artisans and craftsmen,
fund fisher visits to better fishing areas, and provide equipment and support to market products in
neighboring countries; and (ii) infrastructure for artisanal fishery and fish marketing (US$1.7 million),
including support for retailing and wholesaling fish and fish products by establishing a cooling chamber,
ice making factory, marketing hall and union activity center, and improvement of transportation
technology.

25.     Sub Component 3: Policy, Institutional and Capacity Building: (US$0.25 million). It
supported provision of technical assistance (TA) for: (i) Policy and institution building, including: (a)
drawing up a comprehensive plan for Blue Nile Fisheries, which was subsequently shared with State and
Federal Ministries; (b) preparing a report for developing a fisheries research center and establishing
research infrastructure; and (c) carrying out an institutional study of the Fisheries Department in order to
develop a restructuring proposal for a research and outreach oriented departmental arrangement, and for
participatory management of fisheries resources. (ii) Capacity building support was provided to
strengthen the fisher unions, technically, and in relation to securing micro-credit, as well as federal fishery
departments. The sub-component also sought to support the capture and dissemination among union
members of best practice on fishing, fish processing and marketing.
26.    Sub-Component 4: Support for the PCU (US$0.25 million), which as implementing agency
was provided financing to cover costs of its operations for one additional year.
2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
27.      The project met its PDO despite the challenges of implementation in a highly fragile and conflict-
affected context. In part, the project was able to meet its PDO by: (i) aligning with wider peace-building
approaches in Blue Nile State; (ii) having a strong PCU; (iii) benefiting from a relatively stable state
political environment; (iv) having strong risk management measures; and (v) the Bank team providing TA
and strong implementation support to the PCU.



                                                      4
2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
28.     Project preparation and design were responsive to the emerging policy frameworks and aligned
with donor and GoNU strategy in peace-building, stabilization and recovery. The project did suffer from
design weaknesses, specifically in M&E and in the preparation of project documentation. The Project also
misjudged the capacity (or willingness) of the GoNU to contribute counterpart funding.
29.      The project is characterized by a particularly high level of required counterpart funding that many
key stakeholders in the BNSEP have argued was unrealistic. The project however was part of the MDTF-
N portfolio for which this was a requirement and despite eventually discounting federal counterpart
support to this project; GoNU provided nearly 60% of total MDTF-N commitments via counterpart funds.
This is a rare level of co-funding in a fragile state and in effect, through counterpart funds, the MDTF-NS
substantially enabled pro-poor allocations in a way and at a level that would have been unlikely without
the donor partnership.
30.     By design, the project was an emergency response in a highly fragile and conflict-affected
environment that did not have a significant history of recent Bank engagement. The Bank re-engaged
Sudan in 2004 after a gap of nearly 10 years. However, normal financial support from IDA at the time of
re-engagement was (and is currently) not possible due to Sudan’s outstanding arrears accumulated since
1993 and estimated at US$600 million. In addition, the project was located in a difficult environment
made all the more challenging by the risks and complexity of operating in a transitional area, under
temporary joint administration, with limited capacity, infrastructure, and Bank experience in the region.
31.      The strategic context to the project preparation and design comprised: (i) the 2005 CPA, which
set the stage for recovery, reconstruction and development efforts to sustain and consolidate peace; (ii) the
2005 JAM, and (iii) the subsequent GoNU Five-Year Strategic Plan (2007-11). Strengths of the project
design include how it has aligned with the CPA. Specifically, the project provided assistance to the
implementation of the CPA by encouraging fiscal transfers to Blue Nile State. The project, as part of the
MDTF-N, was leverage to secure GoNU provision of nearly 60% of total MDTF-N commitments in the
form of counterpart funds (US$350 million), a very rare (as discussed further below) level of co-funding.
In effect, the MDTF-N substantially enabled pro-poor allocations in a way and at a level that would have
been unlikely without the donor partnership. Increased fiscal transfers to the transition states was a
contributing factor in the government’s eventual decision to discontinue federal counterpart funding for
MDTF emergency projects. This decision was taken on the basis that GoNU would manage the issue of
government-funded Components through its budgetary process and directly with the concerned states.
Based on that, MoFNE recommended that the Bank and PCU approach the State Government to fill the
gap, which provided US$5.8 million for rural roads construction, taking total counterpart commitment
(MoFNE, USF, and BN State) to approximately US$9.1 million, i.e., above the original co-financing
commitment.
32.      The project addressed the socio-economic focus in the CPA through its activities: access to basic
services, reconstruction of infrastructure and the recovery of some basic economic development of
conflict-affected population. It addressed the institutional development component of the CPA by
providing capacity building for government institutions and key actors, including the PCU.
33.      The project design was also strengthened by its alignment with the priorities of the Joint
Assessment Mission (JAM). The donor-led JAM identified the development needs of Sudan and
emphasized eight sectors, thematic clusters and cross-cutting issues. The project aligned itself with these
needs, as well as the subsequent GoNU Strategic Plan, specifically in terms of: (i) institutional
development and capacity building; (ii) productive sectors; (iii) basic social services; (iv) infrastructure;
and (v) livelihood and social protection.
34.   The project had design weaknesses, specifically in document preparation, including the Project
Implementation Manual (PIM), which was created retrospectively in 2010 as part of the preparation of the



                                                     5
AF. The Results Framework was weak, although it was later updated to include the mandatory Core
Indicators. Because it was initially intended as an emergency project (with an emphasis on securing quick
impacts to bolster peace building and mitigate the risk of return to conflict), it did not develop a rigorous
M&E framework. In addition, the project did not have a baseline against which progress could be
measured: all indicators were set at zero, which meant any project activity was unavoidably an
improvement. Project KPIs were largely oriented to measuring outputs, which while they assisted project
monitoring (as evidenced in the reporting of the MA), were not accurate indicators of impact.
Nevertheless, these weaknesses did not significantly impact implementation or success of the project
largely due to a strong PCU and flexibility by the PCU and Bank team to adapt to changing circumstances.
35.     The PDO was too broadly configured to enable identification of its expected contribution to
recovery and peace-building, which is largely explained by the emergency nature of the project. By no
means a justification, but weak PDO formulation and project documentation are often a consequence of
quick project design, preparation and implementation in unstable environments with little infrastructure or
prior Bank experience, limited baseline data and prior knowledge of the political economy of the region,
and emphasis on securing quick results. Moreover, Bank field presence during design and implementation
was limited; its office in Khartoum was only two years old with minimal staffing.
36.     As with the rest of the MDTF-N portfolio, the GoNU counterpart funding commitment was set
too high and was unrealistic, particularly given the fact that Sudan was at an early stage of recovery from
war, and was still in the process of preparing for the eventual secession of the South. The decision of the
GoNU to discontinue counterpart funding to BNSEP (communicated on October 29, 2008) negatively
affected implementation of the majority of project activities.
37.      The project was responsive to the needs of the Blue Nile State Government and to conflict-
affected populations in the State. Some components included consultations by implementing partners
concurrent with community capacity building activities. For example, UNIDO conducted community
consultations while delivering capacity building in revolving fund management and community
development as part of Component 5. Stakeholder consultations also informed the design of some
activities during project extension. For example, the involvement of local fishers and skilled tradesmen in
the design of activities via consultation managed by the PCU. By engaging local stakeholders, the PCU
managed to increase the sustainability of the project by altering the design based on these consultations.
Rather than procure new fishing boats to replace old and damaged stock, the project organized local
carpenters and fishers to repair old stock and replace unsalvageable materials with locally sourced timber,
with the assistance of locally sourced tradespeople. Boats repaired and built were registered and plated so
that they could be identified, and for the first time received appropriate upkeep and repair.
Risks and Risk Mitigation
38.      The identification and management of risks was satisfactory. The project was designed with
strong and realistic risk analysis and mitigation measures. Project risks were rated substantial in the FPP,
with four risk categories identified, as well as issues pertaining to project complexity and implementing
partners: (i) security, political stability, and political will to support the project; (ii) capacity of State
Government, particularly lack of experience in program implementation, financial management and
procurement; (iii) procedural and implementation risks, including: (a) transfer of counterpart funds in a
timely manner; (b) procurement delays arising from customs, transport and availability of locally-sourced
goods; and (c) availability of contractors capable of implementing planned activities with required
quality; and (iv) fiduciary risks.
39.     The risk of conflict and political instability was largely beyond the control of the project.
However, measures aimed at mitigating other risks have contributed to the management of risks related to
general instability, which are inherent in the external environment. These measures include designing the
project as an emergency intervention with the aim of a fast disbursement of funds and achievement of
results where the “quick wins? success of the project can mitigate the potential negative impact of slow


                                                      6
project effectiveness on confidence and community buy-in, thus contributing towards stabilization.
Similarly, the mitigation of challenges in capacity, and procedural and fiduciary risks all contributed to
better implementation and thus helped the project avoid any negative impact in an unstable social and
political environment. Furthermore, the implementing partners of the CPA (GoNU and Sudan Peoples’
Liberation Movement (SPLM)), as well as the State Government committed to the project. As the project
was implemented, achievement of results contributed to cementing that commitment despite serious
implementation challenges due to the loss of counterpart financing.
40.     Currently, security-related threats to the sustainability of project outcomes persist in Blue Nile
State with increasing confrontation between Sudan’s Armed Forces (SAF) and SPLM-N in the State and
the indefinite postponement of popular consultations, which, as per the CPA, were to facilitate the
determination of the constitutional situation of the State. At time of writing of this ICR, confrontation
between the SPLM-N is occurring in South Kordofan. The third transitional area, Abyei, is currently
under the complete administration of the GoNU with the Abyei Area Administration (AAA) (power-
sharing body established to govern the State) dissolved. Consequently, security-related threats to the
sustainability of the project outcomes remain substantial.
41.     The project utilized three implementation modalities to mitigate risks resulting from severe
capacity challenges: (i) 100% MDTF-funding, implemented by UN agencies (original Components 1, 3
and 5); (ii) 100% GoNU-funding, implemented by Blue Nile State institutions (original Components 2
and 6); and Federal Government institutions (original Components 4 and 7). By diversifying
implementing agencies, the project was able to start some components when others were experiencing
delays. Nevertheless, there were implementation challenges with both UNIDO and UNICEF, which
caused UNIDO in particular to experience significant delays in the implementation of its activities.
Diversifying implementing agencies had an impact on the efficiency of the project with UN-implemented
Components being the more expensive to implement compared to those implemented by the PCU. The
project delegated implementation of Components 1, 3 and 5 to existing programs or work-plans of
UNICEF and UNIDO. To further mitigate capacity-related risks, project design was kept simple and
largely focused on works and construction, as well as having sub-components focused solely on
procurement.
42.      Fiduciary risks were identified as substantial and mitigation measures identified at project design
including: (i) delegation of implementation to UN agencies (UNICEF and UNIDO); (ii) recruitment of
fiduciary professionals in the PCU; and (iii) simple design of project activities. At project completion, it
is clear that measures taken during project implementation also contributed to mitigating risks,
particularly: (i) the hands-on approach of the Bank team to project management and assistance to
implementing partners; and (ii) the quality of the PCU, particularly the Chair and the overall capacity of
the unit.
2.2 Implementation
43.     Blue Nile State faces severe constraints as a result of the conflict, lack of infrastructure and
communications, weak governance and institutional capacity, its status as a transitional area, as being
affected by the confrontation between SPLM-N and the SAF. Despite this highly unstable environment,
the project successfully completed its activities, met most key performance indicators (original and
revised), and achieved its PDO. Furthermore, after completion, results from the project have been
consolidated by the PCU, which has sought Bank financing (including through the State and Peace-
building Fund) and non-Bank financing to develop new programs in agriculture and apiculture. If
successful, this is likely to consolidate the sustainability of some project outcomes. This is a significant
achievement given the security and political instability and significant capacity challenges.
44.     Implementation of restructured activities during the AF show how the project evolved from an
emergency response to the needs of Blue Nile State into a project addressing longer-term issues. This is
particularly the case in the restructuring of Component 7 and extension of Component 5, both of which


                                                     7
responded to needs presented to the PCU and a focus on sustainability and long- term impact. An example
is the 20-year master plan for the regional fisheries industry produced during project extension and shared
with the State Government. This master plan built on the emergency response to rehabilitate local
fisheries, by building the capacity of fisher organizations and developing a longer-term master plan for
the sector in response to the likely influx of larger fishing operations due to the damming of fishery areas..
45.     Project implementation faced the following challenges:
        (a)     Project Component Re-structuring: the original design of Component 7, the supply of
        anti-malarial bed-nets, was changed by the PCU in response to a request of the State Ministry of
        Health for support for the establishment of the Centre for Disease Control.
        (b)     Project Restructuring and AF: Component 5 (Rural Households Livelihood Support)
        was extended to increase the coverage and depth of the component over a longer time period.
        (c)     Counterpart Finance: arguably the most significant challenge to project implementation
        was the decision of GoNU to terminate counterpart funding to the BNSEP resulting in
        implementation delays and requiring the PCU and Bank team to obtain alternative financing to
        ensure implementation of the project.
        (d)      Activities poorly suited to the local (State) context: a consequence of UNIDO
        transferring already implemented activities from other transition States, such as South Kordofan,
        to Blue Nile State without taking into consideration local specificities and geography. Some
        activities were wholly unsuited to the Blue Nile State.
        (e)    Capacity of Implementing Partners and the PCU: UNIDO faced challenges in
        implementing a design adapted from another setting resulting in the delayed implementation of
        some activities. Challenges faced by the PCU were relatively minor, especially in FM and
        procurements, and they were effectively addressed through TA and strong support by the Bank
        team.
46.     Restructuring Component 7 was a timely response to the fact that anti-malarial bed-nets were
being supplied through other programs. Although the revised component (establishment of the CDC) was
to be funded by MoFNE, in the event it was financed through the MDTF-N (construction) and the Unity
Fund (furniture and equipment). The PCU has worked with the State Ministry to ensure the Center
functions independently under the overall coordination of the Health Ministry, and that the CDC pricing
structure aligns with market rates and does not negatively impact private sector health service provision.
47.      Extending and restructuring Component 5 was a response to poor design and slow
implementation by UNIDO. As was the case with UNICEF for Components 1 and 3, the Bank entered
into direct agreement with UNIDO for the implementation of Component 5, to which the agency would
apply its own procurement and disbursement rules, and manage the project expenditure component.
48.      In addition to a slow approach to project implementation, further delays were caused by the
replication of activities implemented in the Rural Households and Livelihood Support Component of the
South Kordofan Start-Up Emergency Project and applying them in Component 5 of the BNSEP without
assessing their suitability in the region. UNIDO planned to produce and supply 2000 sets of hand tools,
200 sets of animal traction tools and to deliver training in the production of hand-tools and animal traction
components to 20 blacksmiths. It also planned to introduce the Nuba hoe (an agricultural tool used in
South Kordofan); however, the tools are unsuited to the soil conditions in Blue Nile State. Moreover,
UNIDO introduced animal traction in locations where it is not suitable, not used, and where there is no
history of maintaining the animals used or the manufactured components. Ultimately, it is unclear where
the responsibility lies in vetting the UNIDO design and whether the Bank team or the PCU should have
identified shortcomings and sought modify the design of UNIDO’s component. The Bank team noted the




                                                      8
lack of coordination between UNIDO and line Ministries and during the Mid-term Review in 2009 put in
place additional monitoring of the UNIDO component to overcome design issues.
49.      Shortcomings in the component were addressed through AF which: (i) enhanced the coverage of
the previous Rural Livelihoods Program; (ii) strengthened and modernized the artisanal fisheries activity;
and (iii) supported the provision of TA for policy and institution building (including the 20-year Fisheries
Master Plan) and capacity building of fishers and fisher unions. As a result, improved fishing methods
and management of stock were noted in the case of fishers, and new equipment and facilities were
provided.
50.     The most significant challenge to implementation of the whole project was the decision by GoNU
to discontinue counterpart funding, which negatively affected the following activities and components.
Table 3: Implementation delays resulting from withdrawn counterpart funding

Component 2: Rural roads, Maintenance and Spot Improvements
Duration of delay is not evident from Bank TT, together with the Country Manager and Project Coordinator, reached an
MA reports or MTR                      agreement with the Governor of Blue Nile State whereby in exchange for securing
                                       additional MDTF financing for the Component, the State would directly finance the
                                       construction of 85kms of rural roads under its ongoing road improvement program.

completed by the end of Q2 (2010).
Component 6: Capacity Building
Absence of counterpart funding for     The TT and Project Coordinator were able to secure funding (US$454,540) for this

implementation; however,               restructuring.
restructuring somewhat mitigated that
cause of delay.

51.     To address the counterpart funding issue, the Bank team and PCU recommended that: (i) the
Bank team discuss with MoFNE the future of the project and try to ensure that GoNU meets its funding
commitments through the MDTF-N, direct budget support, or through the Unity Fund; (ii) the PCU
discuss with relevant State Ministries how their respective components can still be implemented; (iii) the
Bank explore internal trust fund options to support peace and development in the State; and (iv) the State
Government continue efforts to secure funding from MoFNE.
52.     In the end, the shortfall in counterpart funding (US$7.52 million) was met through the
contributions of the State Government and through the USF totaling US$5.8 million and US$2.2 million,
respectively. The total counterpart funding disbursed for the project, from State Government, USF and
GoNU, was US$9.1 million (GoNU contributed US$1,096,730).
53.     In summary, the 2009 and 2011 MTRs appropriately identified the implementation challenges
mentioned above, and mitigation measures to address them. In addition, the strong implementation
support by the Bank team in most areas of project implementation including FM and procurement, the
hiring of international procurement expertise to complement the PCU, and the close working relationship
between the PCU and the Bank team all contributed to the effective identification, management and
correction of implementation challenges throughout the project cycle.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E Design


                                                           9
54.      At the design stage, it was not envisaged that the project would have a comprehensive M&E
system because of its emergency nature. In the FPP, M&E is described as consisting of the preparation of
quarterly Progress Reports by implementing agencies (except for reporting on Component 4, which was
semi-annual), focusing on outputs, implementation progress, financial statements and results against
monitoring indicators. Data would essentially rely on limited existing sources and routine data collection
by the project. The project M&E framework thus concentrates more on monitoring than evaluation, with
results largely output-oriented and little capacity to evaluate impact. In the final analysis, the project had
good tracking of inputs and outputs in line with the original design, and later, with Core Indicators
incorporated in revised frameworks.
55.      The absence of a comprehensive M&E system with an evaluation component in Bank-financed
emergency projects is common, and it constitutes a fundamental design flaw. In this case, an opportunity
was missed to capture the good performance of the project, as well as relevant implementation lessons,
including learning about direct and indirect impacts, implementation innovation and good practices. Such
evaluative learning could prove highly useful for other projects in Sudan, as well as for other fragile and
conflict-affected settings in and beyond the region.
M&E Implementation and Utilization
56.     Monitoring arrangements and frameworks were appropriately applied to gauge implementation
progress. MA reporting in particular provides a concise overview of the progress of the project toward
achieving outputs, tracks implementation delays, and adequately rates project performance in FM,
counterpart funding, procurement, administration, and implementation relative to performance of the
MDTF-N portfolio overall.
57.     The Bank team monitored project progress through close, effective on-the-ground
implementation support, particularly in the early stages of the project when there were delays (e.g., delays
in Component 5 implemented by UNIDO). Standard Bank reporting tools such as ISRs and MTRs
contain summaries of progress toward achievement of the PDO and KPIs, as well as implementation
performance and planned actions to address challenges.
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
58.     ISRs rate compliance with social and environmental safeguards as satisfactory for the duration of
the project.1 The project recognized that GoNU had only limited capacity on safeguard policies. The Bank
team and PCU focused on: (i) application of Bank Africa Regional Environmental Guidelines for CDD
Projects; (ii) precautions in the Water Supply Component to assure hygiene at water-points (human and
livestock) and monitoring of the drawdown of the water-table in the region; and (iii) appropriate disposal
of mines. However, activities were implemented before any Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) or
mitigation management plans were prepared. To close this gap, the Bank team commissioned a
retrospective assessment of project environmental impacts, which reported no significant negative
impacts. In preparation for extension of the project, an Environmental and Social Management
Framework (ESMF) was prepared (January 2012), which included EMPs for relevant components.
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
59.      The project closed June 30, 2012. There are no specific plans for follow-up project activities or
for monitoring the sustainability of project outcomes. The PCU and Bank team have attempted to design
activities in a way that they can be sustained by the State government, or for the PCU and State
authorities to seek additional financing sources to extend project activities and implement activities that

 As per OP/BP 8.00 the project was processed under simplified procedures regarding social and environmental
safeguard policies.



                                                      10
were not part of the project plan but were conceived during implementation. For example, the PCU has
developed two new activities on seed propagation and beekeeping which could be eligible for Bank SPF
funding or sources outside the Bank. The component would construct and equip a seed propagation
laboratory to develop early maturing seeds that can be harvested before the seasonal migration of
pastoralists, thus removing a source of conflict (often violent) between farmers and pastoralists.
60.     An important outcome of the project is the establishment of a strong and capable PCU which has
taken a broader development role in the State, beyond a project implementation unit for a Bank project.
As the PCU has grown in strength, effectiveness and credibility as a technically competent agency, it has
taken on a more active developmental role in the State. The PCU is now able to address development
needs, find innovative solutions to the State’s development challenges, prepare proposals for external
funding and has forged a productive and close relationship with State authorities. PCU capacity was
strengthened through support provided by the project but also, importantly, through close interaction with
and direct support from the Bank team. This is an important institutional legacy of the project that is
benefiting the State and its people.
61.     There are no plans to regularly monitor the state infrastructure and equipment funded by the
project. Longer-term sustainability of project investments will depend largely on whether these are
maintained by State authorities. Many of the issues identified in the “MDTF-N Assessment of Program
Sustainability? (October 23, 2011) have or are in the process of being addressed by the PCU, but
comprehensive information on the state of repair of infrastructure completed during the project is
unavailable. For example, while the PCU is aware that many of the water-points constructed under
Components 1 and 3 are functional, it is also aware that some are not (information is not available on
which ones). UNICEF (Component 1) did not uniformly create Water Users Associations that, along with
the State Water Corporation and the Locality, should manage the water infrastructure and upkeep. In this
scenario, it is uncertain which body is responsible for the upkeep of water infrastructure.
3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance of Objectives and Design
62.     The Project’s objectives, design and implementation are rated satisfactory. The original PDO
was relevant to:
    (i) The 2005 CPA, which set the stage for recovery, reconstruction and development efforts to
        sustain and consolidate peace. The project supported CPA implementation by encouraging fiscal
        transfers to the Blue Nile State. It addressed the socio-economic focus through its activities in
        access to basic services, reconstruction of infrastructure (including de-mining), and the economic
        recovery of conflict-affected populations in the State. The project addressed the institutional
        development component by providing capacity building for government institutions and
        associations formed as part of project activities, including during AF and particularly in the
        fisheries sector.
    (ii) The Bank-led 2005 JAM (and subsequent GoNU Strategic Plan). The project aligned with the
         JAM priorities in terms of: (a) institutional development and capacity building; (b) productive
         sectors; (c) basic social services; (d) infrastructure; and (e) livelihood and social protection.
    (iii) The Bank’s country strategy (Country Re-engagement Note for the Republic of the Sudan
          2003, and the ISN 2008-2009). The Note set the basis for the Bank’s re-engagement and the
          eventual creation of the MDTF-N. The project’s activities were fully in line with the Bank’s re-
          engagement and transition strategy for North Sudan, with an emphasis on strengthening public
          administration, rural development, infrastructure, health and education. The project was also
          aligned with the ISN, which focused on: (a) improving governance; (b) increasing access to basic



                                                   11
        services; and (c) ensuring sustainable, diversified and pro-poor growth, with primary attention to
        conflict-affected and marginalized areas. The ISN indicated the Bank would focus on the key
        provisions of the CPA as a means to ensure stabilization. Support for the three areas was a key
        provision of the CPA.
Relevance of Implementation
63.     Project implementation was effective, especially in adapting to changing circumstances, looking
for solutions when problems emerged, placing emphasis on capacity building, and to the extent possible
managing to shift project focus from an immediate emergency response to consideration of longer-term
issues and questions of sustainability. Effective project implementation is especially noteworthy given the
very difficult setting in which the project and Bank team had to operate.
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
64.     Based on KPIs, the project satisfactorily achieved its PDO. As discussed earlier the KPIs do not
assess impact and in some cases do not link outputs to outcomes. Nonetheless, most KPIs were either
achieved early or exceeded. PDO-related KPIs called for people in rural areas to be provided with access
to “improved water sources? with 71,000 general population and 100,000 pupils as target beneficiaries.
The KPI was achieved by Q3 of 2010. The KPIs also called for a total of 200 farmers adopting and being
trained in new technologies, which was achieved again by Q3 of 2010. PDO-related KPIs aimed at
clearing or verifying 14 high-priority suspected or mined areas and roads in about 33 communities,
affecting a population of 54,000; this was completed by Q3 of 2010. Another KPI aimed at delivering
capacity building in finance, economy, local government, education and public planning to 720
government employees was significantly exceeded (2,058 government employees were trained by Q2 of
2011). The AF contributed to this KPI being exceeded. The PDO-level KPI relevant to the CDC was
improved disease control through investigative samples undertaken by the disease control center (72,000).
The performance of the CDC exceeded expectations, and by Q3 of 2011, it had processed 320,000
samples. The project therefore met all intermediate KPIs.
3.3 Efficiency
65.      Project efficiency in achieving its PDO is rated satisfactory on the basis of: (i) on target
disbursement during the original project and the AF despite implementation delays; (ii) very low
supervision costs (with effective supervision by the Bank team; (iii) low administration costs for both the
original project and AF; and (iv) the ability of the PCU and Bank team to find alternative financing when
GoNU withdrew counterpart funding.
66.    The project’s arrangement to utilize a PCU and two UN agencies (UNICEF and UNIDO) to
implement the majority of project activities constituted an appropriate strategy to mitigate against
implementation constraints. The results, however, point to the higher costs associated with UN
implementation, relative to a well-functioning PCU.
67.     Supervision costs for the project are among the lowest of any comparable project in the MDTF-N
(Table 4) with the BNSEP costing US$56.6 thousand per year on average.

68.     Administration costs for the original project were also low, and the amount disbursed largely
aligned with the original grant allocation (US$1,004,464.64 disbursed compared to US$1,092,000.00).
Administration costs for the original grant were US$237,839.06, and AF administration costs amounted
to US$268,786.20. This brought the total administration cost for the completed project to US$506,625 or
2.7% of the actual final project cost of US$18.922 million (all sources).
69.      As an emergency project, BNSEP did not include economic or financial analysis for
infrastructure sub-components. Similarly, no analysis of the livelihood component was conducted to
gauge the impact on average household, either in the project or in the AF. KPIs do not cover the
economic impact of the project. Some evidence suggests the overall economic impact is positive. CDC
established under Component 7 is generating income. The ice-making factory built under AF is leased to
the private sector and improved fishing practices and equipment are likely to have increased incomes in
fisher communities along the Nile.
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
70.      The Project is rated satisfactory because it was relevant in its design and implementation to the
needs of Blue Nile State and to the overarching Bank and non-Bank strategic frameworks. It has
satisfactorily achieved its PDOs and had satisfactory efficiency. The Bank team reacted effectively to the
implementation challenges presented throughout the project cycle, and both the Bank team and PCU
performed satisfactorily, particularly in the provision of TA and day-to-day guidance (Bank team) and in
sourcing alternative financing when GoNU withdrew counterpart funding (PCU and Bank team).
Furthermore, the project has built the State Government and PCU capacities to develop some of the
activities of this emergency intervention into potential future peace-building and state-building projects.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
71.      There is a wide range of likely poverty impacts, but the exact impact on the conflict-effected
population of Blue Nile State is not clearly measurable due to data limitations. Beneficiaries of specific
Components – for example, farmers in Component 5, fishers and local trades-people in AF activities – are
likely to experience some improvement in household income. The project is likely to have generally
contributed to the educational attainment of children in the State which should improve chances for better
income generation opportunities. For example, basic numeracy and literacy increases access to income-
generating activities such as market trading. Building the capacity of fisher cooperatives and fisher unions



                                                     13
in tandem with rehabilitating the commercial infrastructure for fish processing and preservation is likely
to have a longer-term impact on productivity and incomes.
72.      The project has laid a foundation that may result in significant gains for both farmers and
pastoralists. Should the PCU be successful in securing financing for the development of the seed
propagation activity, there is likely to be additional contributions to better yields for participating farmers
and significant income and social gains as a result of mitigating cyclical conflict between farmers and
pastoralists. Overall, the project contributed to stabilization in the Blue Nile State and, in specific sectors,
has laid the foundation for possible future gains in income generation and access to essential services in
health, education and water. While exact impacts are difficult to measure, initiatives such as BNSEP have
contributed to reducing marginalization, a key driver of conflict in Blue Nile State, and therefore
to reducing community engagement in new conflicts. Contrary to past conflicts in the region, the
renewed fighting in Blue Nile since September 2011 is politically motivated and largely confined to
the Sudan Armed Forces and SPLA-N.


73.      The project was not designed with a gender component, but late in the project cycle it became
sensitive to basic gender considerations. It evolved to utilize some basic gender sensitive indicators which
showed that 53% of project beneficiaries were women (of the 774,000 beneficiaries noted as of December
31, 2011). Women (as opposed to ‘gender’) were explicitly targeted in the AF through the capacity
building of two women’s associations with 90 members working in fish processing, and thus benefited
directly from the AF activities.
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
74.      The project specifically addressed capacity building and institutional development in economic
development, local governance, education and public planning. The program of activities it delivered
accounted for 94% of the Blue Nile State’s capacity building program. The methodology employed by the
PCU was logical and consistent beginning with an inception workshop with Director Generals and Local
Ministry staff, progressing to an externally and independently prepared technical assessment of
institutional weaknesses, and finally to a fully implemented training program across Government
Ministries. The capacity building program of BNSEP was co-financed with GoNU (ultimately through
USF) and included a procurement-focused element that supplied 17 offices, 10 living quarters, and 76
teachers and healthcare dormitories.
75.       Under the AF, the project also created the physical infrastructure of the CDC contributing to
disease control in the State. However, the impact of the CDC exceeds the envisaged KPIs (all of which
are quantitative and pertain to clinical investigations) and extends to bolstering the institutional capacity
of the State in healthcare. The CDC developed an educational wing, which currently trains healthcare
staff for work throughout the health system in the State, thus contributing to the overall capacity of the
sector and not just to the health of the population.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
N/A
3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
N/A
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
76.    The main risk to the development outcomes is external: the unresolved constitutional nature of
Blue Nile State and the risk of violence and destabilization. Given the growing presence of SAF in Blue


                                                      14
Nile State and how both Abyei and South Kordofan have become embroiled in either violent
confrontations between SPLM-N and SAF or have had their joint administrations dissolved by the GoNU,
there is a very real risk that the State will destabilize and that gains made with BNSEP will be lost in the
future.
77.      Additional risks to development outcomes come under the broad heading of the maintenance of
infrastructure. As noted above, steps were taken to ensure that infrastructure provided during the project
remains in a good state of repair, particularly water infrastructure to the general population and to school-
users (pupils). If such monitoring provisions were in place there would still be significant difficulty
accessing the area, and travel there is tightly controlled by GoNU. Consequently, there is no monitoring
of the condition of water infrastructure other than through the field knowledge of the PCU, which
indicates that most of the water points and hafirs are functional but that not all water management
committees have been established by the implementing agency. Thus, the function of the committees (to
manage the water points and payment for accessing water) is not present in all locations. Furthermore,
according to the PCU an undefined number of schools have been damaged or destroyed in intermittent
violence in Damazin.
78.      Sustainability has been addressed in the AF activities, with focus being placed on the legacy
impacts of the project through building a fisher union and transforming the seed distribution sub-
component into the construction of a seed-research facility. Issues regarding the financial sustainability of
the CDC are being addressed, as is the operational independence of the Centre. In spite of this, any gains
made in the sustainability of project outcomes and maintenance of project outputs in a highly fragile and
conflict-affected context can quickly be lost if violence recurs.
5. Assessment of Bank and Grantee Performance
5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
79.      Bank performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry is rated moderately unsatisfactory due to: (i)
deficiencies in the preparation of project documentation including the Project Implementation Manual
(PIM); and (iii) poor M&E framework. This rating takes account of the fact that as an emergency project
(with an emphasis on securing quick impacts to bolster peace building and mitigate the risk of return to
conflict), BNSEP did not benefit from a longer project preparation phase. As such documentation was not
prepared during the preparation phase or soon thereafter and at design it did not envisage a rigorous M&E
framework that would have enabled more accurate and reliable measurement of impact. Nevertheless,
these weaknesses did not significantly impact implementation or success of the project. The PIM was
created retrospectively in 2010 and the output oriented KPIs employed were appropriate for this type of
situation and assisted project monitoring (as evidenced in the reporting of the MA). .
80.     As mentioned above, the project did have strategic relevance and the approach was consistent to
managing the risks associated with implementing a project in fragile and conflict-affected environments.
The Bank team engaged with key stakeholders in the restructuring of Component 7 and, through the PCU,
engaged a variety of stakeholders in the design of the AF including beneficiary communities. In addition,
the project became effective within a reasonable timeframe of nine months from FPP to effectiveness of
GA with the State Government of Blue Nile.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
81.   Bank supervision is rated satisfactory because: (i) there was satisfactory identification and
management of fiduciary and safeguard issues, although some delay was noted in the implementation of



                                                     15
the environmental risk mitigation plan; (ii) there was responsive and, at times, appropriately hands-on
supervision of the project by the Bank team; (iii) the Bank provided appropriate and needed TA,
including external expertise on procurement.
82.     Bank supervision was responsive to the needs of the project and capacity issues of the PCU, and
sought to address implementation delays including those emanating from UN implementing agencies.
Bank AMs are succinct and to the point, and communications with key stakeholders including the
implementing agencies and GoNU Ministries are clear. Despite the project’s implementation challenges,
the Bank team maintained good working relations with GoNU and the State Government, which is critical
where the Bank has been inactive for a prolonged period and relations have to be rebuilt.
83.     The Bank team provided hands-on supervision to address implementation delays, including the
slow start-up of UNIDO-implemented activities. Also, the team built close working relations with the
PCU, especially in technical areas such as procurement and FM. As a result of this close collaboration the
PCU quickly mastered Bank procedures and benefited from the support offered by the Bank team. Lastly,
the Bank team was responsive to Government needs to change and restructure the project and acted
expeditiously to restructure Component 7 and in designing the AF.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
84.      The Bank team rigorously and closely engaged with the project and its key stakeholders during
implementation and the design of the restructured Component 7 and the AF. The team identified and
managed the risks associated with the project and, where needed, engaged in a hands-on manner to ensure
implementation constraints were addressed which allowed the project to close as planned as possible, and
achieve its PDO and KPIs. However, as was common throughout the MDTF-N portfolio, the Bank team
overestimated the capacity of GoNU to deliver on its counterpart funding commitments and failed to
prepare relevant project documentation on time. The impacts of the project, including important
subsidiary or unintended impacts, remain unsubstantiated and links between project outputs and outcomes
are largely unverified.
5.2 Grantee Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
85.     The rating of the performance of GoNU is rated as unsatisfactory primarily because of its
decision to renege on its pledge to provide counterpart funding in line with its original commitment of
US$8.02 million (to the MDTF-N commitment of US$7.32 million). This proved to be the main
implementation issue for the whole project; GoNU-implemented components such as de-mining were
impaired, as were co-financed non-GoNU components. At the time of the MTR (January 2009) the Bank
team was still seeking clarification from MoFNE, which was not timely in its communication, around the
decision to withdraw counterpart funding. Despite this constraint, the Bank team and MoFNE (as well as
other Line Ministries) have managed to maintain a good working relationship. Finances from the USF
replaced much of the counterpart funding originally committed by GoNU.
86.      Despite this and the early stage in conflict recovery, GoNU had created an enabling policy
environment through its coordination with the JAM and production of its Strategic Plan. Fiscally, the
National Government was addressing stabilization needs of the Blue Nile State through USF, which
would eventually replace counterpart funding in the project. Although counterpart requirements were
clearly onerous for GoNU and a solution was eventually found, the Government’s decision not to meet its
commitment or to communicate this clearly to the Bank affected project implementation.
87.     The State Government was clearly committed to the project and took ownership not just of
project activities but, along with the PCU and Bank team addressed the counterpart deficit. Its


                                                   16
performance is rated as satisfactory. While the State Line Ministries lacked technical and physical
capacity, it is clear from the outputs of Component 6 that Ministries were eager to benefit from the project
in order to better serve the needs of the beneficiary population. The State Government had no direct role
in FM or procurement, or indeed in M&E; however, it remained involved in the assets gained through the
project (e.g., the CDC) and supported the PCU to achieve project goals. Although GoNU performance is
rated as unsatisfactory this is offset by the satisfactory government performance at the state level, which
justifies an overall rating of moderately unsatisfactory for the government as a whole.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
88.   The project had four implementing agencies: UNICEF (Components 1 and 3), UNIDO
(Component 5), GoNU (Component 4), and the PCU (all other Components and all those under the AF).
89.     Despite some minor procedural issues concerning the draw-down of funds, UNICEF performed
satisfactorily, implementing all activities on time and achieving all KPIs. UNIDO performed
unsatisfactorily, with delayed commencement of implementation, poor project design and poor
coordination with the relevant Line Ministries. Both agencies appear to have conducted adequate
community consultations but the difficulties with the UNIDO Component suggests these consultations
may not have been effective. Both agencies adhered to reporting progress toward achieving output-
orientated KPIs, although not always on time.
90.     The PCU performed well and receives a satisfactory rating. The PCU was recruited and became
operational relatively quickly (there were minor delays regarding its Technical Needs Assessment) and
throughout project implementation it has shown a strong commitment to its development objectives. Its
capacity to engage with Bank procedures gradually improved during implementation, and despite what
were largely minor errors, the PCU had good FM and procurement procedures. The PCU emphasized
stakeholder consultations and has engaged all stakeholders adequately during project implementation, the
design and preparation of the AF, and in meeting its M&E requirements. With support from the Bank
team, the PCU has made active efforts to extend existing activities, develop new ones and prepare
proposals that could mobilize additional funding. Although the ICR template requires a rating for all
implementing agencies, the performance of the PCU should weigh more heavily since it is an important
achievement of the project and represents institutional capacity that remains after project closure.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Grantee Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
91.      The overall rating for grantee performance is based on a moderately unsatisfactory rating for the
performance of the Government as a whole (GoNU and State Government), a moderately satisfactory
rating for the performance of implementing agents, noting that the performance of the PCU is of greater
importance, and an overall project outcome rating of satisfactory. Save for counterpart funding issues,
broad Government support (especially at the State and PCU levels) played a major role in the project’s
satisfactory outcome.
6. Lessons Learned
92.     BNSEP was designed early in the Bank’s re-engagement with Sudan and at a time when a new
Bank and donor strategy on Sudan was emerging. The design and implementation of BNSEP was, to a
large degree, concurrent with this development of Bank strategy. As such, BNSEP did not benefit from a
more developed and structured strategic context. Furthermore, the project was implemented before the
Bank’s recent analysis of its own work in FCS (which culminated in WDR 2011). Regardless, it still has
important project-related and general FCS-relevant lessons to contribute.




                                                    17
93.      Capacity building in FCS needs to be an integral part of project design, and in extremely
low capacity settings investing in a strong PCU is risky but has potentially high pay-offs. Much of
the success of BNSEP has been built upon the work of the PCU. The Unit contained the correct
competencies and skills for it to be successful in project implementation and in project design.
Furthermore, it was perceived as independent and operated in a transparent and open manner. It also
strove to develop a close working relation with the Bank team. The PCU benefited significantly from TA
in procurement and FM, including that acquired through close working relations with Bank staff; the
more competent the PCU became in Bank procedures, the more efficient it became in project
implementation, reporting and design. For future programming, it is critical that the government, with the
encouragement of the Bank where possible and appropriate, ensure that the PCU be constituted quickly
but with the right combination of skills and expertise. As the experience in Abyei (also a border area
where the Bank implemented an emergency project) shows, this is not always the case or something the
Bank can fully control. Once the PCU is established, it can be politically difficult to change or reform and
if ineffective can seriously undermine project objectives and broader capacity-building efforts. To
mitigate this risk, hybrid arrangements may be appropriate, with a nascent PCU at the center of
implementation arrangements but complemented by other temporary implementing agencies so the entire
project is not compromised by a less-than-effective PCU. Intensive capacity efforts can still concentrate
on the PCU which if effective, as in this project, can emerge with the ability to take on a broader and
longer-term development role.
94.      In FCS settings much TA and capacity building can be effectively provided through regular
Bank supervision and by forging close relations with the PCU. TA provided by the Bank team,
directly and through consultancy and international expertise (most notably in procurement), contributed to
the effectiveness of the PCU and the overall effectiveness of the project. Familiarization and competence
in Bank procedures and safeguards allows the PCU to fully benefit from what otherwise might be
perceived as complex and sometimes painstaking procedures. The Bank should continue to formally (and
informally) provide TA as early as is possible in the life of the PCU or implementing agent in order to
contribute to a greater likelihood of success of any project.
95.       Counterpart funding requirements need to be realistic in the context of a government
emerging from a context of fragility and conflict. As outlined in the MDTF-N Country Portfolio
Performance Review, BNSEP and projects in FCS in general should be designed with realistic
expectations of counterpart funding. The unrealistic funding to which GoNU agreed should have been
better analyzed by the Bank, and the ability of GoNU better assessed. Such high counterpart funding
requirements were clearly unrealistic in Sudan’s case and the Bank could have encouraged a renegotiation
with MDTF-N donors to something more fiscally viable, or if politically not feasible, at least looked in
advance at other potential funding sources. As this project shows, when there is strong local ownership
and commitment, there may be alternatives to centrally-sourced counterpart funding which the Bank
could have assessed ex-ante and thus possibly avoided project delays which emerged when GoNU found
itself in a constrained fiscal situation.
96.      As in any project, but especially in an FCS setting where the Bank has been absent for a
long period, it is critical that project components are well adapted to local conditions. A weakness
in the BNSEP was the transfer of activities from one location (South Kordofan) to another (Blue Nile)
without fully investigating their applicability to the local context. While the pressure to show early results
in settings such as Blue Nile is understandable, care must be exercised when there is wholesale transfer of
activities from a different setting. As a minimum, the subcomponent should build in a validation process
to ensure that the imported models are relevant in the different setting, and there is a strong built-in
feedback mechanism by local stakeholders that can alert implementing agencies on the need to adapt or
make corrections. In the case of Blue Nile there were a number of government, producer and community
structures that could have been used and consulted to validate their applicability to the local context.

97.      Although emergency projects generally do not always pay full attention to good M&E
systems at the project design stage, they should not be completely ignored. Even if crude or rough
some attempt should be made to establish baselines and better measures of impact. Any project
monitoring should clearly link outputs to outcomes, which should be uniformly applied across monitoring
executed by the Bank team, PCU, implementing agents, Grantee and the MA. Furthermore, evaluation, at
least for key Components, should be based on a baseline study and a structured approach to assessing the
impact on beneficiary communities. This is an area where the Bank’s M&E experts could develop better
guidelines for designing basic M&E systems better and more realistically adapted to fragile and conflict-
affected settings.
98.      Exit strategies for emergency operations are essential but rarely articulated. Emergency
projects can have a quick start-up and an equally abrupt ending without any structured formal exit
strategy. In the case of BNSEP, there was no exit strategy by design; rather, the Bank team and PCU
together developed the next round of project proposals based on the implementation of the AF. It would
be sensible for the Bank to have a structured exit from any emergency project that: (i) retained the
capacity built in the PCU (and local implementing partners where relevant) in order to be of value in the
life-cycle of other projects or in relevant sectors outside those immediately addressed by the Bank; and
(ii) included support for the PCU or relevant stakeholders to seek other donor or implementing agent
support in building upon the outcomes of the emergency project.
