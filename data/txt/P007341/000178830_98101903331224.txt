APPRAISAL OF FOURTH POWER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of the Fourth Power Project
for which the Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE) of Honduras
has requested Bank Group assistance totaling US$11.0 million.
ii.       The Bank Group has provided major financial assistance in
Honduran power development through three loans and one credit, totaling
US$21.75 million, for three ENEE power projects. The first two projects
have been successfully completed; the third project is under construction
with satisfactory progress and is expected to commence operation by
the end of 1970.
iii.      ENEE is a fully government-owned corporation responsible for
the development and operation of power facilities in Honduras. The Bank
Group's assistance has enabled ENEE to establish an interconnected system
and to increase the energy production almost six times during the last
six years. The total installed capacity of the interconnected system -
predominantly hydro - and several isolated diesel plants, is 60 MW which
represents 73% of the country's total capacity available for public power
supply. ENEE's management has shown marked improvement since the re-
organization in 1969. However, its engineering staff still needs
strengthening.
iv.       The interconnected system presently encompasses only the narrow
strip from the capital city of Tegucigalpa to the Caribbean port of Puerto
Cortes.  Under the Project ENEE proposes to extend the system:
(a) to serve the important towns of Tela and La Ceiba
on the northern coast which are now supplied by
two fruit companies with inadequate diesel in-
stallations (the concession of one company has
expired),
(b) to supply the Aguan Valley which is being develop-
ed, and
(c) to supply the southern zone presently served by
E\EE's isolated diesel plants.
v.        The Project is a part of ENEE's five-year (1970-1974) ex-
pansion program calling for a total investment of US$54 million. It
would consist mainly of: (a) 138 kV and 69 kV transmission lines and
substations, (b) subtransmission lines and substations, and (c) a gas
turbine plant. The Project would also provide funds to cover communi-
cations and maintenance equipment, training, and studies of future hydro-
electric     projects and tariffs.  The total cost of the Project is
estimated at US$14.8 million with US$11.0 million in foreign currency,
which wouild be financed by the Bank Group.



- ii -
vi.       The design and supervision of construction of the principal
items of the Project would be carried out by consulting engineers. Pro-
curement would follow the Bank's guidelines. The Project is expected
to be completed by the end of 1973.
vii.      Honduras is the least economically developed country in
Central America. It is also lagging behind in the electric power field
despite ENEE's achievements in recent years. The Project would lay a
sound foundation for further development. Extension of the transmission
lines would replace the inefficient diesel installations by the more
economical power of the interconnected system and would also help open
up new areas for economic development.
viii.     ENEEts financial condition and earnings are satisfactory and
are expected to remain so.
ix.       The Project would form a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$5.5
million equivalent with a term of 20 years including 4 years of grace,
and for an IDA credit of the same amount. As in the case of the Rio Undo
Project (Loan 541-HO/Credit 116-HO) the loan and the credit would be made
to the Republic of Honduras which would relend the proceeds to ENEE on
the terms of the Bank loan.

APPRAISAL OF FOURTH POWER PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises   the Fourth Power Project
for which Bank Group assistance totaling US$11.0 million equivalent
oas been requested by the Empresa lNacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE),
the Government-oined authority which is responsible for the development
and operation of power facilities in Honduras. A Bank loan of US$5.5
million equivalent and an IDA credit of the same amount are proposed.
The Borrower would be the Government of Honduras, which would relend
the proceeds to ENEE to cover the foreign exchange costs of the Project,
the total cost of which is US$14.8 million.
1.02      The Project would extend ENEE's main interconnected system to
important areas in the north and the south, replacing diesel engines,
and would permit, sooner than would otherwise occur, full utilization
of the power to be produced by the Rio Lindo hydroelectric scheme under
construction (being financed by the Bank Group) and other future projects.
1.03      The Bank Group has helped finance three power projects in
Honduras, providing major financial support for power development in
addition to loans from US AID and the Central American Bank for Economic
Integration (CABEI), and enabling ENEE to increase its investment in
plant during the last ten years more than twelve-fold. In 1959, Loan
226-HO for US$1.h5 million was made to ENEE for a project to provide a
2.5 MW diesel generating plant at the capital city of Tegucigalpa and to
improve the city's distribution system. The following year, Loan 261-HO
for US$8.8 million was made to ENEE for construction of the 28.5 MW
Canaveral hydro station (the first stage of Lake Yojoa-Rio Lindo Develop-
ment) and associated transmission facilities. Both projects have been
successfully completed. In 1968, Loan 541-HO for US$7.5 million and
Credit 116-HO for US$4.o million were extended to the Government, mainly
to assist ENEE in the construction of the 40 MW Rio Lindo hydro station
as the second stage of the Lake Yojoa-Rio Lindo Development. Construction
progress of this project is satisfactory, and the first generating unit
is expected to be commissioned by the end of 1970.
l.o4      This report is based on a feasibility report prepared by
ENEE's consultants, R.W. Beck & Associates, and on the findings of an
appraisal mission composed of Messrs. Hui Huang, Carel de Beaufort
and A. Bouhaouala which visited Honduras in February 1970.



2. THE POWER SECTOR
General
2.01      A mountainous country with an area of some 112,000 km2, of which
only about one-sixth is arable, Honduras is the second largest of the
five Central American countries and ranks third in population. Its
population of about 2.5 million is growing rapidly at a rate of over 3%
per year. In recent years, Honduras has experienced a reasonable degree
of political stability and has achieved satisfactory economic progress.
The annual rate of growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) has
averaged 6% in real terms. With the per capita gross national product
(GNP) estimated at only about US$260 the country is still the poorest
among the Central American countries.
2.02      Agriculture accounts for about 40% of the GDP.  Bananas have
long been the leading export, but coffee and lumber have gradually
assumed importance. Recently there has been a rapid expansion in manu-
facturing, especially in the area of San Pedro Sula, the principal city
in the north. The manufacturing sector now contributes about 15% of
GDP. Several large industrial projects have been proposed for imple-
mentation in the near future, the most important being a large pulp
and paper project near La Ceiba to exploit the abundant forest resources
in the Aguan Valley. The International Finance Corporation is partici-
pating in the pilot project and is expected to participate in the full
project.
2.03      Since ENEE embarked on the Canaveral hydro project in 1962,
Honduras has made great strides in power development with an almost six-
fold increase in electricity production during the last six years.l/
Further progress will be realized when the Rio Lindo hydro station com-
mences operation by the end of 1970.  As of now, however, the per capita
annual electricity generation is only 104 kWh and less than 20% of the
total population is estimated to have electrical service.
2.04      Public electrical service in Honduras is provided by ENEE,
private companies, and municipalities. As shown below, the present
installed capacity totals   82 MW   and the total energy generation in
1968 is estimated at 225 GWh (excluding captive industrial plants - see
paragraph 2.17).                         Present
Installed Capacity Generation in 1968
ENEE                            6o vw               194 GWh
Private companies               20 YI                29 GWh
lunicipalities                   2 14W                2 GWh
Total                     82 MW                225 GWh
1/ In 1964 energy sales increased 94% over 1963 due to the coming into
operation of Canaveral, the acquisition of the San Pedro Sula system
and a tariff reduction.



-3-
ENEEIs Market
2.05      ENEE is the principal supplier of power.  Its main system
(the interconnected system) serves the most populous and important
zone including the capital, Tegucigalpa, the new industrial center of
San Pedro Sula in the north, and Puerto Cortes on the Caribbean coast
(see rriap). It also supplies the country's two major industries -- the
silver mines at Pochito and the cement factory at Bijao. Under the
proposed Project ENEE would extend the interconnected system to the
north and the south to encompass new power markets.
2.06      The interconnected system presently consists of 229 km of 138 kV
transmission lines and 50 km of 69 kV lines connecting seven hydro and
diesel power plants with a total installed capacity of about 54 MW. The
28.5 MW Canaveral hydro station is the major source of power. The 40 MW
Rio Lindo station and a 15 MW gas turbine at San Pedro Sula are under
construction and expected to be commissioned by the end of 1970. Details
are shown in Annex 1. In addition, ENEE operates 14 isolated plants
totaling 6.2 MW. The largest is the 2.2 MW diesel plant at San Lorenzo
which was recently installed to meet the increasing power demand of the
southern zone.
2.07     Tegucigalpa, the political and commercial center, is served
with a long transmission line coming from the Canaveral station and
does not have an adequate local back-up power source to cope with any
interruption of the line.  Under the proposed Project, a gas turbine
would be installed at Tegucigalpa to ensure reliable supply.
2.08      San Pedro Sula has had an extremely rapid economic growth
in recent years and has become the most important industrial center of
Honduras. Puerto Cortes is the largest seaport in the country, and its
development has been financed by a recent Bank loan. Power to these im-
portant areas is presently supplied with a single 138 kV line from
Canaveral to San Pedro Sula and a single 69 kV line from San Pedro Sula to
Puerto Cortes. To provide economical means of delivering reliable power
to these areas, ENEE proposes to construct, under the proposed Project,
another 138 kV line from the Rio UIndo station to San Pedro Sula viaEl Progreso
and Bufalo, and another 69 kV line from San Pedro Sula to Puerto Cortes.
2.09      Outside of the interconnected system ENEE serves 13 other
towns including the newly industrialized town of San Lorenzo in the
south and the largest southern town of Choluteca by means of isolated
diesel plants. Under the proposed Project, the interconnected system
would be extended with a 69 kV line to these towns. The southern zone
is a potentially rich region whose rapid development the Government has
been promoting in recent years. A large cotton ginnery at San Lorenzo
and a silver mine on the route of the proposed line have been in operation
for a number of years with inefficient power installations; they would
be served by ENEE. Several industrial projects are planned. The merits
of improved port facilities in the area are being investigated by a Bank
financed feasibility study.



2.10      E12EE plans to supply important areas which do not yet have
electric service, either by installing diesel units which are no longer
needed in the interconnected system or, if the distances are not too
great, by linking these areas to the main system with 34.5 kV subtrans-
mission lines (in some cases to be operated at 13.8 kV initially). Under
the proposed Project the latter method would be used to supply the Tamara
Valley near Tegucigalpa, the Comayagua Valley, and La Masica near La Ceiba.
Santa Barbara, the center of a large rural population presently served by
ENEE with an isolated diesel plant, would also be connected to the inter-
connected system.
La Ceiba and Aguan Valley
2.11      Of the ten private companies supplying power to the public, the
most important are the two fruit companies - the Standard Fruit Company
and the United Fruit Company through its subsidiary, the Tela Railroad
Company. The former supplies La Ceiba, the largest town on the north coast
and the third largest town of Honduras, with a diesel plant of 5.5 I4.
Inadequate facilities and high costs have inhibited the increased use of
electricity. With Standard's utility franchise at La Ceiba having expired,
EIEE plans to purchase the power properties from the company and, as part
of the proposed Project, to extend the interconnected system with a 138 kV
line to serve this city. A new highway is being constructed from San Pedro
Sula to Tela and La Ceiba. New pineapple plantations have been established
near La Ceiba, and an international airport as well as the large pulp and
paper mill mentioned in paragraph 2.02 is proposed to be built nearby.
These various projects will stimulate economic activity in this area.
2.12      The Standard Fruit Company also operates irrigation pumps driven
by diesel units at its banana plantations at Isleta (total about 3,000 hp)
and Coyoles (total about 8,000 hp) in the Aguan Valley. For the most
part these units are old and inefficient and the operating cost is high.
ENEE would be prepared to extend a 69 kV line as part of the Project from
La Ceiba to the valley if the company converts its pumps to electric drive.
However, ENEE willonly construct this extension if it is financially and
economically justified.
2.13      Through the National Agrarian Institute, the Honduran Government
recently launched a land reform program to develop the lower Aguan Valley.
Included in this large-scale program are new settlements and the establish-
ment of packing and processing plants for agricultural products. An
Inter-American Development Bank loan of US$7.5 million is helping to finance
the undertaking, in which many public agencies including ENEE are partici-
pating.  Thus, in addition to electrifying the irrigation pumps, the
extension of ENEE's transmission system to the valley would meet the power
requirements of this important agricultural development program and thereby
contribute to its implementation.



-5-
Tela and Sula Valley
2.14      The Tela Railroad Company owns two diesel plants in the north
coast area - one at La Lima with a capacity of 7.4 MW and the other at
Tela with a capacity of 2.6 MW. Each of these plants provides energy
to the company's employees and industrial establishments as well as to
the respective municipalities. As part of the Rio Lindo project, ENEE
has under construction a 69 kV line from San Pedro Sula to La Lima and
El Progreso. The city of Tela is the second largest town on the north
coast and the third most important port of Honduras. The proposed Project
would extend a 138 kV line from El Progreso to Tela, thereby enabling
ENIEE to serve both La Lima and Tela directly and also the company's facili-
ties in these municipalities on a wholesale basis.
2.15      The company also operates a number of diesel-driven irrigation
pumps in the Sula Valley with a total capacity of about 22,000 hp. If
the company converts these pumps to electric drive, ENEE would supply
power to them wholesale, provided a satisfactory contract can be concluded.
Minicipalities
2.16      Some twenty municipalities provide public electrical service
by operating diesel or hydro units of small capacity. These units are
inadequate and the power costs are high. Whenever the interconnected
system reaches these municipalities, ENEE will take over their electrical
services completely and increased consumption can be expected because
of a more adequatepower supply and lower rates.
Industrial Power Plants
2.17      A few industries in Honduras have their own power facilities.
The total capacity of these facilities is estimated at 23 IW. Their energy
generation in 1968 is estimated at 35 GWh, whichl together with the estimated
output of 225 Gdh for public electrical service brings the country's
output for 1968 to 260 GWh. The most important of the industrial power
facilities are the diesel plants owned by the sil ver mines at Mochito
(5.6 MW) and the cement factory at Bijao (2 Nd). As noted heretofore,
these two industries receive their primary power supply from ENEE and
maintain their power plants as standby.
Future Hydroelectric Development
2.18      Honduras is rich in hydro power resources.  Potential sites on
the Humuya River are particularly attractive because of favorable technical
features and proximity to the power market. Motor-Columbus of Switzerland
is carrying out feasibility studies for projects on the river financed under
the loan/credit for the Rio Lindo project. From their preliminary findings,
it appears feasible to build a high dam (about 220 m) at El Cajon creating



- 6 -
a very large reservoir which could produce a considerable amount of power
(of the order of 400 1W) and effectively control the floods in the Sula
Valley. The cost of energy would be low and it might be economic to export
part of the output to neighboring countries, particularly to Nicaragua,
which otherwise would have to resort to more expensive thermal power
generation in the future. However, since such a large multi-purpose
project requires intensive studies of various technical and economic
aspects, which take time, it may be preferable to first undertake a smaler
hydro project o.n the Ulua River which has been explored previously.
ENEE has agreed to continue employing consultants acceptable to the Bank
and the Association for studies on the two rivers. The decision on the
priority of development would be ma d e only after sufficient information
on both projects has been gathered.
2.19      Because neither the El Cajon project nor the Ulua River project
can be expected to be completed by the end of 1974 when additional generating
capacity would be required (see Annex 4), ENEE would have to construct an
interim thermal plant. On the other hand, there is the possibility of
Nicaragua supplying ENEE's needs during this interim period as an initial
phase of interconnection between the two countries. In any event, this
matter would be resolved by EwEE and the Bank before the middle of 1971
in order to allow sufficient time for the construction of the thermal plant,
if the supply from Nicaragua cannot be arranged.



3. THE PROJECT
Five-Year Program
3.01      The proposed Fourth Power Project, which is essentially the ex-
tension of the transmission facitities, is a part of ENEE's five-year
development program for the period 1970-197a. The program calls for a
total investment of about US$5 million and would consist of the following
works in addition to the Project:
Under Construction
(a) Rio Lindo project;
(b) Gas turbine at San Pedro Sula;
(c)  Second 34.5 kV line to the I4ochito mines.
Future Works
(a) Interim thermal project to be started in 1971 (at
La Ceiba - two 30 MW units) for initial operation
by 1974 (paragraph 2.19);
(b) Major hydro project to be started in 1974 for
initial operation by 1977 (paragraph 2.18);
(c) Improvement and expansion of existing distribution
systems;
(d) Supply to additional towns;
(e) Feasibility studies of future power projects.
3.02      The Drogram is adequate to meet the needs, but the generating
projects in (a) and (b) above are subject to review and revision after the
completion of the feasibility studies of future hydro power projects
(paragraph 2.18).
Project Description
3.03      The proposed Bank/IDA transmission extension Project would
comprise the following:
(a) 138 kV transmission lines from Rio Lindo station
to Bufalo (near San Pedro Sula) via El Progreso
and from El Progreso to La Ceiba via Tela, total-
ing 227 km; 69 kV lines from San Pedro Sula to
Puerto Cortes, from La Ceiba to the Aguan Valley,
and from Tegucigalpa to the southern zone, totaling
331 kmn; 138 kV and 69 kV substations with a total
capacity of 103 MVA;



- 8 -
(b)  34.5/13.8 kV subtransmission lines totaling 184 km;
and 34.5/13.8 kV substations with a total
capacity of 20 MVA;
(c) One 15 MW gas turbine at Tegucigalpa (paragraph
2.07);
(d) Communications and maintenance equipment;
(e) Training; and
(f) Consulting services for feasibility studies of
future hydro power projects and for a tariff
study (paragraphs 2.18 and 5.o8).
3.04      The voltages adopted are the most suitable for the distances
involved and the amounts of power to be transmitted. All lines will have
single-circuit structures. The 138 kV and 69 kV lines will be on steel
towers, while the 34.5/13.8 kV lines will be on wooden poles.
3.05      The communications equipment would consist of a carrier tele-
phone system installed on the 138 kV lines, similar to that in use on the
existing 138 kV lines. It is required for centralized dispatching. The
maintenance equipment is required for work on the transmission and distri-
bution systems.
3.o6      ENEE's engineering staff needs to be strengthened by employing
some more experienced and competent engineers (paragraph 5.05). Since no
such persons of Honduran nationality are knownto be available at the
present time, ENEE has agreed to engage 4 or 5 experienced and competent
expatriates, on three-year contracts, to assist the existing staff in
carrying out the Project and at the same time to give additional training
to the ENEE staff. ENEE has also agreed to send selected engineers and
technicians from its present staff to foreign power companies for on-the-
job training. The foreign currency funds required for these purposes
would be met by the proposed loan/credit.
Estimated Cost
3.07      The Project is estimated to cost US$14.8 million with a foreign
currency component of US$11.0 million. Ihe estimates of the cost of the
transmission lines and substations and the gas turbine are based on recent
experience with similar works in Honduras and other Central American
countries. A contingency allowance of approximately 12% (8% to cover in-
creases in quantities and 4% to cover price escalation) of the estimated
costs of the lines and substations has been included which should be
adequate. Details of the cost estimates are shown in Annex 2. The
following is a summary:

Engineering and Construction
3.08      Construction of works under the Project would be done by contrac-
tors. Engineering design and supervision of construction for the 138 kV
and 69 kV lines and substations as well as procurement of communications
and maintenance equipment would be carried out by consultants acceptable
to the Bank and the Association. Motor-Columbus would continue with its
existing assignment on the Hnumuya River feasibility studies and would
also carry out the studies on the Ulua River. During negotiations ENEE
confirmed that it will continue to employ qualified consultants, acceptable
to the Bank and Association, to do the above work. ENEE's own staff would
design and supervise the construction of the subtransmission lines and
substations, with which it has previous experience. Preparation of
specifications and tendering for the gas turbine plant also would be
handled by the Empresa based on its recent experience with such an
installation.
3.09      The Project is expected to be completed by the end of 1973.
Procurement and Disbursement
3.10      Procurement of equipment and selection of contractors would
follow the Bank Group's international bidding procedures. Except for the
engagement of the consultants and individuals (paragraphs 3.06, 3.08 and 5.08)
contracts are not expected to be awarded before the signing of the loan/credit.



- 10 -
3.11       Disbursements from the loan/credit accounts would be made for
the CIF cost of imported equipment and materials and for the foreign cur-
rency cost of contractors' erection work, consultants' services, and train-
ing. Disbursements are expected to be completed by mid-1974. In the event
the Project costs less than estimated, any savings from the loan/credit
should be canceled.

4. JUSTIFICATICN
Forecast of Sales and Demand
4.01     The forecast of energy sales through 1980 in ENEE's market is
shown in Annex 3. ENEE's forecasts which have been remarkably accurate in
the past are based on an analysis of historical trends and on forecast
economic and population growth in the different areas served by ENEE. Sales
to large existing customers were projected on the basis of load estimates
furnished by these customers. New major industrial, agricultural and mining
loads were included only for well advanced projects; the pulp and paper
project mentioned in paragraphs 2.02 and 2.11 is not among these and was not
included in the forecast.
4.02     The average growth of energy sales in the areas presently served
by ENEE's interconnected system is forecast at 15%, considerably below the
24% observed during 1965-1969, because of the expected slower industrial
growth in these areas. However, including the forecast sales for areas to
be added to the interconnected system, total sales are expected to increase
at an average annual rate of 21% through 1974. Maximum demand in the
interconnected system which was 44.5 MWJ in 1969 is expected to increase to
121 MW by 1974 (Annex 4). These forecasts which have been reviewed by
ENEE's consultants are satisfactory.
Justification of the Transmission Extensions
4.03     The principal component of the Project is the proposed extension
of transmission lines to important northern and southern towns and to the
Aguan Valley, in line withl the Government's policy of economic diversifica-
tion by developing these potentially rich areas. The important towns of
Tela and La Ceiba in the north and San Lorenzo and Choluteca in the south
are presently served by isolated diesel generating units which are inadequate
to meet their expected growth in demand. The proposed transmission line
extensions to these towns would ensure reliable service at lower cost, as
small inefficient diesel units would be replaced by the more efficient
hydro and thermal plants of ENEE's interconnected system. The economy
would also benefit from the substitution of the small diesel units used
to drive irrigation pumps in the Aguan and Sula Valleys.
4.04     ENEE's consultants have examined alternative methods of supplying
the areas to be included in the interconnected system and have concluded
that the proposed transmission extension is the most economical way of
supplying power to these areas. Isolated units could continue to be used
to supply these areas, but this would result in a higher cost operation
of the country's power sector.
4.05    T7he incremental financial rate of return (see Annex 10) on the
investment needed for the north coast interconnection from El Progreso to
the Aguan Valley is about 10%. The incremental financial rate of return on
the investment needed for the southern zone interconnection is about 14%.
These incremental financial rates of return are based on
conservative sales forecasts and the actual returns could be higher.

5. EMPRESA NACIONAL DE ENPiGIA ELECTRICA
Organization and Management
5.01     The Empresa Nacional de Energia Electri-ca (ENEE) was established
in 1957 by law as an autonomous authority wholly owned by the Government
and responsible for developing and operating power facilities in Honduras.
It is a reasonably well-managed utility.
5.02     ENEE is governed by a Board of Directors composed of five members:
the Minister of Communications and Public Works, as Chairman; the Minister
of National Resources; and representatives of the National Economic Planning
Council, the Development Department of the National Development Bank, and
the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  The two Ministers are
appointed ex-officio. The term of office of the other three representatives
is three years and they are eligible for reappointment.
5.03     A General Manager, appointed by the Board, is responsible for
all managerial and admlnistrative functions. The ENEE Law stipulates
that the appointment of the General Mqanager shall be reserved to persons
with technical and administrative ability, experience and academic
qualifications in the power sector. The present General Manager, a civil
engineer, is a capable executive. He was appointed in October 1965.
Under the previous loans and credit ENEE agreed to carry out its functions
under the direction of a qualified and experienced General Manager mutually
satisfactory to ENEE and the Bank Group. This provision   was         confirmed
during negotiations and incorporated in the loan and credit agreements.
5.04     When the financing of the Rio Lindo project was under considera-
tion, the Bank found ENEE's organization weak and its operating procedures
too cumbersome to cope with its heavy expansion program and, consequently,
suggested that ENEE engage a management firm to help improve its management
and organization. In 1968 ENEE retained the services of R.W. Beck &
Associates to make a study of ENEE's organization and operating procedures
and to recommend any needed improvements. After the Beck report was
submitted and reviewed by ENEE and the Bank in 1969, work on the reorganiza-
tion commenced with Beck's assistance and is still in progress. As part
of their assignment, the Beck firm formulated the By-laws delineating
the General lvianager's authority and specific duties in order to facilitate
day-to-day operations. The Board recently adopted these By-laws,
essentially as recommended by the Consultants. ENEE's management is
already showing a marked improvement, especially with regard to decision-
making on operational matters.



- 13 -
5.05      ENEE's engineering staff has always been weak resulting in lack
of sound development planning and causing frequent delays of construction
work. A competent expatriate engineer with considerable experience was
recently engaged as a Technical Adviser to the General Manager to deal
with planning and engineering matters. ENEE has also recruited a number of
young Honduran engineering graduates, but they lack experience. The
engineering staff still needs strengthening and training (paragraph 3.06).
Tariffs
5.o6      The ENEE Law gives the Empresa the authority to establish power
tariffs; however, it does not stipulate the basis for determining the
tariffs. In the agreements for the previous loans and credit, a minimum
rate of return of 10% on fixed assets was specified. Thi-s provision is
continued in the new agreements. In recent years ENEE's rate of return
has been well above this level.
5.07      ENEE's tariffs have remained practically unchanged since 1964t.
The overall average revenue per kILXl sold is now about 7.2 centavos (US¢3.6).
It is the highest in Central America but necessary at the present time
because of the need to generate cash for expansion (paragraph 6.07).
After the completion of the Project, some reduction in the tariffs might
be justified. The tariffs for the isolated systems are generally 30-50%
higher than those of the interconnected system.
5.08      In order to attract irrigation pumping loads of the fruit companies
(paragraph52.12 and 2.15) it is necessary for ENEE to formulate appropriate
off-peak tariffs for this purpose. The general structure of its tariffs
should also be reviewied. Because ENEE does not have a qualified commercial
engineer to handle tariff matters, it has agreed to engage consultants
to carry out a tariff study and submit their recommendations for review
by the Bank and Association. The required foreign currency funds would
be provided under the proposed loan and credit.
Capital Structure and Financial Position
5.09      ENEE's financial position is sound. Since 1963 when it suffered
from a shortage of working capital, its liquidity has been satisfactory
and its equity has been increasing at a rapid rate. Due to the reinvest-
ment of earnings, the debt/equity ratio shows a strong improvement from
68/32 in 1965 to 52/48 in 1969.
5.10      The followring table contains a summary of the preliminary balance
sheet at December 31, 1969, as shown in Annex 5.

Long-term Debt, Excluding Current Maturities   35.1            17.5
Current Liabilities                               5.0            2.5
Total Liabilities and Equity               73.6          36.8
5.11      Except for the negligible part identified in footnote 1 to Annex
5, the utility plant has been stated at cost. This is acceptable in view
of the fact that 90% of the assets were acquired during the last ten years,
which in Honduras was a period with a fairly stable level of prices. -
5.12      Straight-line depreciation is charged on each group of assets
at percentages based on their useful lives. The resulting rate of deprecia-
tion on average utility plant in operation during 1969 was 3.4% wlhich is
satisfactory.
5.13     lWorking capital is at a high level of L4.2 million (US$2.1 million)
with a current ratio of 1.83:1. At Ll.9 million (US$1 million) cash
balances are also at a fairly high level, which is prudent in view of the
sizable payments to be made in 1970 for construction, including the
additional cost of the Rio Lindo project largely due to the revaluation
of the German mark, the general contractor being a German firm. The
current assets include accounts receivable from customers in the amount
of L3.2 million (US$1.6 million) or 22% of the operating revenues for
1969 which is somewhat high, but not a major problem. During recent years
this percentage has remained almost constant in spite of ENEE's efforts
to reduce the amount of arrears. W4hile the arrears of various departments
of the Government were reduced, other groups of consumers, especially
hospitals, fell behind in their payments. To some extent the problem was
complicated by errors made in the billing department. ENEE is taking
adequate action to remedy this situation.
5.14      The deferred debits of L1.0 million (Us$0.5 million) consist
mainly of the cost of preinvestment studies.  These costs will be transferred
to the plant account when the projects are carried out.
1 In calculating the rate of return, the gross value of the assets is
determined "in accordance with methods of valuation or revaluation
acceptable to the Bank". At present the book value is accepted for this
purpose.



- 15 -
5.15     At the end of 1969, US$12.2 million or 66% of the disbursed
and outstanding long-term debt consisted of financial assistance given
by the Bank Group. Details of the Group's loans and credits are given
in paragraph 1.03; their original amounts total US$21.8 million.  Most
of the remainder of the debt consisted of a 3½% US AID loan for L5.6
million (US$2.8 million) made in 1961 and maturing in 1987, to help
finance the Canaveral Hydroelectric project, and of local 7% and 73-4
ten-year bonds with an outstanding amount of L6 million (US$3 million).
These bonds were placed by the Central Bank of Honduras which guarantees
their debt service.
Auditors
5.16     The financial statements of ENEE are audited by Price Waterhouse
and Co., Guatemala, wlich is satisfactory.  ENEE   has agreed   that its
accounts will continue to be audited by a firm of accountants acceptable
to the Bank, and that the accountant's report will be transmitted to the
Bank within four months after the end of each financial year.
Earnings Record
5.17     Financial ratios for the 1965-1969 period are given in Annex 9.
Since 1964, when during the latter part of that year, hydroelectric energy
became available from the Canaveral plant, ENEE's rate of return has
shown a steady increase. The minimum rate of 10% agreed upon with the
Bank in 1968, has been earned in every year since 1966. During the
period, sales of energy grew at the high average rate of 24% but net
income did even better with an average annual rate of increase of 34%.
Net income for the five-year period totaling U9.1 million (US$9.5 million)
was used to help finance a 70% increase in gross plant during the period.
Operating expenses were held at a moderate level.

6. FUTURE FINANCES
Proposed Financing Plan
6.01      During the five-year period 1970 through 1974, net internal cash
generation is expected to finance 38.7% of the construction and acquisition
program-plus additions to working capital.  This is satisfactorv espeuially
in view of the fact that during tnis period the investment in p±antow l
increase by about 140%. Government contributions will cover 0.8% of the
requirements and borrowings 60.5%. The following table gives a summary of
the financing plan:

Total Borrowings                         67.0      33. 
6.03      The proposed loan and credit would be made to the Government which has
agreed to relend the proceeds bo ENEE for a term of 20 years including 4 years
of grace, at the interest rate of the Bank loan, under a Subsidiary Loan
Agreement satisfactory to the Bank and IDA.
6.04      Arrangements have not yet been made for the future loans which
will be required to finance the interim thermal plant and the hydroelectric
project. After the completion of the feasibility studies it is likely
that ENEE will ask the Bank to finance these works.
6.05      The future local financing estiriated at L2 million (US$1 million)
would be required in 1972. On the basis of past experience it is assumed
that ENEE will obtain the necessary amount by issuing ten-year bonds which
would be guaranteed and placed locally by the Central Bank of Honduras.
During the negotiations ENEE agreed to use its best efforts to place bonds
as and when required, or to arrange for alternative financing acceptable
to the Bank and the Association. In 1972 ENEE might also have to draw down
its cash and bank balances and obtain a small overdraft which would be re-
paid within two years. Such a temporary overdraft would be acceptable.



- 18 -
6.o6      As under previous loan and credit agreements the Government has
undertaken to make arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank and Association,
to provide, in case of any inadequacy of funds, the amounts needed to carry
out the Project.
Future Earnings
6.07      During the 1970-1974 period ENEE's rate of return is expected to
range between 11% and 13.9%, well above the minimum rate of 10% agreed with
the Bank. During negotiations, ENEE agreed to continue to earn at least
10% per year on its average net fixed assets in operation. The tariff study
referred to in paragraph 5.08 is expected to recommend revisions in some
of the tariffs. In view of the need for cash generation above the return
of 10% during the construction period of the Project, ENEE has also agreed
that it will not adjust its interconnected system tariffs 1/ during this
period without the agreement of the Bank and the Association.
6.o8      The annual rate of increase of operating revenues is expected to
be about 17.5% and of operating costs about 15%. Considerable fluctuations
are expected from year to year in the operating costs due to changing fuel
consumption. During 1970 fuel expense will be high until the Rio Lindo
project comes into operation. Fuel expense should be low in 1971 and 1972
because Rio Lindo hydro energy will replace thermal generation. Projected
increases in wages range between 2% and 3% per year, based on existing wage
contracts and past increases in wages.
6.09      Net income is expected to increase from L5.7 million (US$2.85
million) in 1969 to L12.8 million (US$6.4 million) in 1974. Total net in-
come for the five-year period is estimated at L46 million (US$23 million).
Since the financing plan is based on the reinvestment of all net income,
ENEE agreed during the negotiations to retain, until the Project is completed,
all its earnings from power for investment in its power facilities.
6.10      Interest coverage will be satisfactory at between 2.8 times and
3.2 times. The average debt service coverage for the period will be 2.1
times; the low for the period will be reached in 1972 with a coverage of
1.9 times which is still satisfactory.
6.11      Forecast income statements are included in Annex 7 and a summary
of pertinent financial ratios is given in Annex 9.
Future Financial Position
6.12      The balance sheet projections for 1970-1974 given in Annex 5
reflect a continuing sound financial position. The additions to ENEE's
plant will be covered for 49% by additions to eqiity and for 51% by a net
increase in the long-term debt. During 1970, the Debt/Equity ratio is
1/ The interconnected system provides 93% of the revenues.

expected to rise from 52/48 to 58/42 because of large disbursements to be
made under Loan 5h1-HO and Credit 116-HO for the Rio Lindo project.
Thereafter, the ratio will gradually decline to 52/48 in 1974.
6.13      ENEE agreed during negotiations that it will seek the consent
of the Bank and the Association before incurring debt if the sum of its
net operating income and depreciation is less than 1.4 times the maximum
debt service in any future year.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
a) ENEE wi1ll not proceed with the construction of the La Ceiba-
Aguan Valley transmission line and other facilities required
to supply irrigation loads before submitting satisfactory evidence
that they are economically justified (paragraphs 2.12 and 2.15);
b)  ENEE will continue to employ consultants satisfactory to the
Bank and Association to carry out feasibility studies of
future hydroelectric projects (paragraph 2.18);
c)  ENEE will engage experienced and competent engineers to assist
its staff and to train its personnel and will send engineers
for training abroad (paragraph 3.06);
d) ENEE will engage consultants, acceptable to the Bank and
Association, to make a tariff study and will submit their
recommendations for review (paragraph 5.08);
e) ENEE will use its best efforts to place bonds as and when
required, or to arrange alternative financing acceptable to the
Bank and Association (paragraph 6.05);
f) ENEE will not adjust its interconnected system tariffs during the
construction period of the Project without the agreement of
the Bank and Association (paragraph 6.07); and
g)  ENEE will retain, until the Project is completed, all its
earnings from power for reinvestment in its power facilities
(paragraph 6.09).

ANNEX 10
Page 1 of 1
INCREMENTAL FINANCIAL
RATE OF RETURN
1.        The incremental financial rate of return on the additional
investment needed to extend the interconnected system to the north
coast and the southern zone is the discount rate which equalizes the
present value of the streams of benefits and costs associated with the
project. The stream of benefits is the stream of incremental revenues
generated by the interconnection over the physical life of the project.
The stream of costs is the sum of the streams of incremental capital
expenditures and of incremental operating costs which ENEE would have
to incur as a result of the interconnection.
2.        Incremental revenues are based on the present tariffs,
except for irrigation loads, for which a low rate of about 3 centavos
per kWh was assumed. Revenues are net of the revenues which could be
derived from the isolated plants presently operating in both areas, as
these plants could still be used for some years.
3.        Incremental capital expenditures are the difference between
the cash expenditures on transmission, distribution and generation which
ENEE will have to incur to expand its system (including the new areas)
and the corresponding expenditures if these areas were not included in
the system's expansion.
4.        Incremental operating costs are the increase in the cash
operating expenses of ENEE's interconnected system as a result of the
extension of service to the new areas after deducting the savings
realized on the operation of theiz existing isolated p'nts.
