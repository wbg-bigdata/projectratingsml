REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN           FOR OFCIAL USE ONLY
FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Loan and Proiect Summary
Borrower:               Republic of Kazakhstan
Beneficiaries:          National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NBK); State Property Committee; Ministry
of Economy; Ministry of Finance; participating commercial banks
Amount:                 US$62 million equivalent
Terms:                  17 years, including five years of grace period, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate
Onlending Terms:        Part of the Loan funds would be on-lent to NBK under a subsidiary loan agreement
between the Government and NBK, with a maturity and interest rate substantially
equivalent to the Bank Loan. Under the Project's commercial bank development
component, proceeds of the Loan up to a total of US$12 million equivalent would be on-

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN
FOR A FINANCIAL AND ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          ! submit for your approval the following report and recomnmendation on a proposed Financial and
Enterprises Development Loan to the Republic of Kazakhstan in the amount of US$62 million equivalent to finance a
program to support restructuring in the financial and enterprise sectors. The Loan would be at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate with a maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace. Co-financing would be provided by the
United States Agency for International Development and bilateral grants.
2.          The Bank's most recent economic report for Kazakhstan (Kazakhstan Economic Report) was distributed
in Grey Cover in July 1994. This project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) as discussed by the
Board of Directors during presentation of the Technical Assistance Project (Ln. 3642 KZ) on August 3, 1993.
A. Country and Sector Background
3.          Kazakhstan has made a substantial progress in building a market economy. At the same time, it is
pursuing a macro-economnic stabilization program whose success and sustainability ultimately depends on extensive
restructuring in the real sectors. Specifically, such enterprise-level adjustment will require a supportive market
environment, effective enterprise governance, and adequate human and financial resources. The Government has made
rapid progress towards ensuring appropriate price signals from liberalized domestic markets and extemal trade, and is
now intensifying its efforts to reduce the power of monopolies. It has also been enhancing enterprise governance,
especially through a comprehensive new privatization program that has disposed, in 1994 alone, of some 400 medium
and large firrns, 2,700 small establishments, and 4,000 trucks. It had also privatized earlier about 7,000 mostly small
enterprises. The Government is also setting up a debt resolution institution (Rehabilitation Trust) to liquidate or privatize
those enterprises that have been accumulating the largest arrears and which cannot be immediately privatized through the
Govermnent's on-going programs. To enhance the human resources for enterprise restructuring, the Governnent has
set up business centers for small enterprises; is establishing a Restructuring Advisory Unit to advise large distressed
firms; and is supporting a variety of training activities including study tours for enterprise managers.
4.          In Kazakhstan's financial sector, policy reforrn and bank restructuring have been accelerating since late
1993, when the national currency was introduced. The banking sector consists of: five old specialized banks, of which
two are privatized; new state-owned housing, development, and export/import banks; four to six new, medium-size banks
that have a good potential for reaching international ban;ing standards; about 15 banks with foreign ownership; and some
160 small new banks which are commonly in fragile condition. Until 1993, banks provided central credit resources at
negative real interest rates. By mid-1994, however, more than half of these resources were subject to auction by the
National Bank of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NBK), and the rest were distributed at interest rates similar to the auction
rate, which reached positive levels, in real terms, in the third quarter of 1994. The authorities are now strengthening
the payments system. Moreover, the legal, regulatory and accounting fiamework of the banking sector is being reformned;
NBK's supervisory capabilities are being enhanced; 2nd banks are being strengthened t.irough training and technical
assistance. Particular efforts aim at restructuring and privatizing the old specialized baniks; the former Savingsbank has
become a common commercial bank (People's Bank), and Agroprombank has been  is'De  of many of its non-
performing loans.
B. Project Objectives and Description
5.          The Govermment of Kazakhstan is conimitted to stabilizing and transforming the economy. It expressed
this commitment in the context of a Standby Agreement with the IMF and the Rehabilitation Loan of the World Bank.
The success of this economic reform program critically depends on fundamental restructuring in the enterprise and
financial sectors. The Project would help to accelerate and deepen this restructuring. It would help continue
privatization; prepare enterprise turnaround and liquidation; resolve bad debts; and develop sound commercial banks,



which would then also be able to finance restructuring and new investment. Moreover, thc Project would help to cnsure
cfficient, rapid, and secure payments within Kazakhstan.
6.          In the enterprise sector, the Project would include the following components: (i) The Bank would continue
its assistance for the implementation of the country's privatization Program. Technical advicc would be provided to mass
privatization, as well as to the case-by-case privatization of very large enterprises. (ii) Advisory services for enterprise
restructurin2 would be provided by a Restructuring Advisory Unit. A corc team of rcsident advisors, supplemented by
short-term expert teams, would support this Unit in helping large distressed enterprises assess their viability and elaborte
restructuring or liquidation plans. The Unit would focus on firms that will be subordinated to the debt resolution
institution described below. (iii) A study tour program for enterprise manapeers would help transfer modem market-
economic management skills to about 160 managers. The tours would be rigorously structured, and accompanied by
preparatory seminars and various dissemination activities.
7.          In the financial sector, the Loan would finance the following components: (i) Consultant advice would
be provided to support the operation of a debt resolution institution ("Rehabilitation Trust"). This institution would take
over the budget claims and bank loans of up to forty insolvent enterprises with very high net debt. It would then make
any additional liquidity or debt relief conditional upon drastic restructuring and privatization, or otherwise pursue
liquidation. The Trust would not provide investment financing; and would operate on the presumption that the firms
would be liquidated unless they implement sound restructuring plans to be followed privatization. The Trust would have
a finite life of only four years. (ii) Institutional development propramns for conmmercial banks would involve intensive
long-term technical assistance by foreign banks or other qualified institutions, and the provision of information
technology. The Loan, with co-financing on a grant basis, would fund such programs for two promising private medium-
size banks meeting pre-specified eligibility criteria, and for two formerly specialized banks -- Agroprombank and People's
Bank -- that would implement rigorous restructuring plans with this assistance. (iii) Prudential bank supervision would
be strengthened through on-the-job training of bank examiners, with a special focus on problem banks. (iv) The Loan
would help fund the long-term investments for a new domestic payments system aimed at, inter alia, same-day finality
of settlements and real-time processing of high value transactions, and at an increasing volume of transactions and a wide
range of payment instruments. To facilitate the interface especially of small local banks with the new payments system,
the Project would make customized commercial banking software available to them.
8.          In addition, the Loan would fund assistance for project implementation through external procurement and
disbursement advisors, and through the training of implementation unit staff.
C. Project Costs and Financing
9.          The total project cost is estimr-ated at US$72.9 million equivalent. The foreign exchange cost requirement
is estimated at US$64.4 million equivalent. The Bank Loan would provide US$62.0 million, or 85.0 percent, of the total
financing requirements. Retroactive financing up to 10 percent of the Loan amount in respect of expenditures incurred
since June 30, 1994, would facilitate early project start-up and effective implementation. The financing required from
the Government and NBK shall be reflected in appropriate budget provisions. (Project costs and financing are
summarized in Schedule A).
10.           The Ministry of Finance (MOF) would allocate on behalf of Government part of the proceeds of the
Bank loan to the State Property Committee (SPC) and the Ministry of Economy (MOE) as budgetary contributions. The
Government would on-lend the balance of the Loan funds to NBK, under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement. The Subsidiary
Loan would have an interest rate, maturity, and grace period substantially equivalent to those of the Bank Loan. Under
the commercial bank development component, NBK would on-lend Loan funds to commercial banks under Subsidiary
Financing Agreements. These latter subsidiary loans would be denominated in US dollars, and extend over ten years
with four years of grace. The interest rates would be equivalent to those on 10-year U.S. Treasury Notes plus 2 percent,
adjusted semi-annually. The banks would bear a commitment fee at a rate equivalent to that paid by the Borrower to
the Bank, payable on the undisbursed amount of their subsidiary loans. The cross-currency risk associated with the
Govermment's borrowing the currency pool and the commercial banks' sub-borrowing in dollars would be covered by
NBK. The technical assistance sub-components of the commercial bank development components would be funded



througlh a conibination of grant funds (for fifty percent of thcsc cost, up to a maximum US$1.5 million per bank) and
proceeds of the proposed Loan.
1i.            Local enterprises that benefit directly from the study tours and restructuring advisory services would
cover a substantial part of the local costs themsclves. Banks would pay fees for the use of the new payments system,
aimed at covering the operating and maintenance costs, and part of the amortization costs.
D. Project Implementation
12.            There would be four counterpart agencies under the Project: N BK for the payment system, commercial
bank development, and bank supervision components; MOF for the Rehabilitation Trust component; SPC for the
privatization component; and MOE for the study tour program and the restructuring advisory services.
13.            Three of the four counterpart agencies (NBK, MOE, and SPC) would also be implementing agencies.
MOF would entrust implementation of its single project component to MOE. The three implementing agencies already
have donor relations divisions or project implementation units with some initial experience in procurement. To ensure
sufficient capacity dedicated to the implementation of this Project, NBK and SPC have been establishing Project
Implementation Units, with initially four local staff in NBK's unit and at !east two in SPC's unit. Coordination with other
official development assistance would be provided by an institution yet to be appointed by the Government, as part of
that institution's broader aid coordination mandate. In their respective areas of responsibility, the NBK, SPC and MOE
would be responsible for necessary coordination, procuremeni, disbursements and project accounts. Amounts and methods
of procurement, as well as estimated Loan disbursements, are shown in Schedule B.
14.            The payment system reform and the study tour program will be overseen by steering committees. The
National Payments Council comprises representatives from commercial banks, industry, and NBK. The Study Tour
Steering Committee includes industry and Government representativts as well as former study tour participants.
15.            Various measures would strengthen the still weak implementation capacity: (i) A consultant firm would
be engaged to provide implementation advice and assistance, for initially twelve months but with the possibility of
extension. Under this contract, one advisor with special computer procurement expertise would work full-time with
NBK's implementation unit; a second consultant would work part-time with SPC; a third expert, with strong experience
in disbursements, would support both MOE as well as NBK and SPC; and the consultants' headquarters would help with
computer system specifications. (ii) Implementation unit staff would be trained on the job, in local seminars, and
overseas. (iii) The Bank would conduct a project launch mission after Loan approval, a mid-term review, a final review,
and additional interim reviews as needed, and it would review all consultant reports.
E. Project Sustainability
16.           The changes in enterprise governance through privatization, the restructuring of complex companies,
and the institutional development of selected commercial banks are meant to provide long-term improvements in
efficiency. The new payment system is designed as a long-term solution for meeting a rapidly growing volume of
transactions, as well as increasing diversity and sophistication of payment instruments. Moreover, the Project would
provide extensive on-the-job training and carefully structured study tours. Most of the skills thus acquired would be
useful beyond the initial phases of Kazakhstan's economic transformation.

F. Lessons Learned from Past Experience
17.           Bank experience shows that fundamental policy retonns for the transition to a market economy require
substantial capacity building, implemcntation advice, and market infrastructure investments in order to be cffectively and
sustainably implemented. Experience also suggests that it is important to maintain the momentum, consistency, quality.
and volume of the external support. Furthermore, the inter-linkages between reforms in the financial and the enterprise
sectors need to be taken into account in the Bank's lending program and project design.
18.           Technical assistance and training to underpin financial and enterprise sector reforms have been part of
many Bank and IDA projects, with generally encouraging results. Some Project components stand out as less common:
(i) The experience with study tours has been mixed, with the mnain risk being the selection of inappropriate participants
and insufficient rigor in tour programs. Under this Project, the selection of participants would follow pre-determined
weighted criteria, involve external consultants and trainers, and be supervised by a Steering Committee. Each tour
member would be responsible for analyzing particular issues, contributing to the tour teams' technical reports, and
participating in dissemination activities. The tour program is built on the positive experience of the vast study tour
program under the Marshall Plan after World War II. (ii) The resolution of bad debt in the banking sector, and the
related restructuring or liquidation of debtor enterprises, has been the subject of Bank projects in Poland and Slovenia,
among others. An IDA Credit to Kyrgyzstan helped establish an institution to manage some thirty distressed enterprises.
The preparation of this Project for Kazakhstan has benefitted from reviewing the experience of these operations. (iii)
Intensive bank-to-bank assistance arrangements (bank "twinning") have been funded by the Bank on an extensive scale
in Poland, with encouraging results. Similar arrangements for thirty to forty banks are the core of the FY 94 Financial
Institutions Development Project for Russia. In the Ukraine, the Bank is supporting bank-to-bank assistance for the
Savingsbank. (iv) The Bank has started funding the modernization of the national Payments systems in China and
Hungary. Similar endeavors are being prepared for the Ukraine. In Kazakhstan, interim improvements to the old
payments system are being implemented under the Bank's Technical Assistance Loan, with excellent cooperation of the
NBK.
19.           The experience to date with technical assistance to the Government of Kazakhstan suggests that: (i)
multi-component projects be implemented directly by the counterpart agencies of the respective components, in order to
avoid difficulties of communication, inter-agency coordination, and conflicting priorities; (ii) substantial extemal
implementation assistance is indispensable, since local Govermment staff are still largely unfamiliar with international legal
customs, financial instruments, consultant industry practices, and complex equipment procurement; and (iii) project
implementation units need a sufficient number of capable local staff. These needs have been taken into account in the
design of the proposed project.
G. Rationale for Bank Involvement
20.            The Project will provide important support for restructuring in the enterprise and financial sectors that
is critical for the success of the country's program of economic stabilization and transformation, to which the Govemment
has committed itself with the IMF and the World Bank. Grant funding from other donors is not expected to be available
in sufficient nuantity, giten the scope of reform activities and the still limited local capacity in specialized fields of
expertise. The Project is closely coordinated with other donors, and would focus on areas that require a particularly large
volume of assistance in the coming two years. The CAS foresees a series of adjustment operations that started in 1993
with a Rehabilitation loan (Ln. 3649-KZ) and is planned to be followed in FY 95 by a Structural Adjustment Loan,
supported by technical assistance operations like the initial Technical Assistance Project, a Petroleum Technical Assistance
Project (Ln. 3744-KZ), a proposed Treasury Modernization Project, and this proposed Project to enhance policy
formulation and implementation capacity. Investment projects would aim at halting the output decline and foster private
sector growth, while a recently appraised Social Protection Project would help alleviate the social impact of the economic
transition. The status of Bank Group Operations is shown in Schedule D.

H. Agreements Reached
21.            During Negotiations agreement was reached on: (i) the program of cquipment and software purchases,
consultancy, and training to be financed under the Loan; (ii) the Project costs and the financing plan; (iii) the Project
arrangements, in particular as regards the role of the project implementation units, thcir staffing and external support,
and the accounting and reporting systems; (iv) the arrangements for the appointmcnt of auditors for the Loan; (v) prior
agreement with the Bank on the criteria for the selection of trainces, and the composition and procedures of the selection
commission, and on the terms of reference of technical assistance; (vi) key organizational and operating principles of the
Rehabilitation Trust and the Restructuring Advisory Unit, as well as on the criteria for the selection of enterprises to be
subordinated to the Rehabilitation Trust; (vii) the eligibility criteria for local commercial banks to participate in the
commercial bank development program under the Project, and on the fact that Agroprombank and People's Bank will
only be included in the program if they present restructuring plans that will be satisfactory to the World Bank and will
be agreed on by the Government and NBK; (viii) the role and composition of the National Payments Council; (ix) the
criteria, mechanism, and responsibilities for selecting seminar and tour participants under the manager study tour
program; and (x) the principles of the financial arrangements (subloan agreements and cost recovery) between state
agencies and commercial b-:.eficiaries in the cases of commercial bank development, enterprise restructuring advice,
manager tour program, and payments system.
22.          In addition, the Government has: (i) enacted satisfactory provisions in the national budget for the first year
of operation of the Rehabilitation Trust; (ii) enacted a Presidential Decree referring to the purpose, nature, and scope
of activities of the Rehabilitation Trust, and prepared a satisfactory draft charter for the Rehabilitation Trust; (iii) agreed
on the main features of the long-term payment system; and (iv) created Project Implementation Units in NBK and SPC,
with at least three staff assigned to the Unit in NBK and at least two staff assigned to the Unit in SPC.
23.          Condition for loan effectiveness is the execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the Government
and NBK.
24.          Conditions for disbursement of the Rehabilitation Trust component are the: (i) establishment of the
Rehabilitation Trust in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, which would include, in addition to a Presidential Decree and
a Government resolution, the registration of the Trust's charter and the issuance ai appropriate banking licenses by NBK;
and (ii) existence of legal and regulatory provisions, satisfactory to the Bank, govening out-of-court settlement of debt
claims and necessary for the successful functioning of the Rehabilitation Trust, such as appropriate legal provisions for
foreclosure and debt transfer. A condition for disbursements under the commercial banking development component is
the fulfillment, with respect to a commercial bank, of the requirements regarding the procedures and accreditation
cnteria, and the terms and conditions of a subsidiary financing agreement between NBK and the respective bank.
1. Environment
25.          Since this Project involves the fnancing only of computer equipment for the financial sector and of
consultancy and tramining, it is a category 'C' Project. The Project would be consistent with Bank policy and would
follow accepted Bank procedures. However, Kazakhstan has many mining and metallurgy facilities that are major sources
of pollution. At present, this pmoblem is excerbated by the strains of ecnomic a_-stment on enterprise performance
and employment, and the weak accountability of enterprise managers. At the same time, concerns about enviromnental
liabilities and uncertainty about enviromental standards and regulations are barriers to privatization and restructuring.
Thereforr, consultancy provided under this Project to the restructuring or liquidation of large enterprises would include
assistance on environmental issues. This would complement existing Bank assistance to the legislative, monitoring and
enforcement capabilitims of the Ministry of Environment and Bio-Resources.
J. Project Benefits and Risks
26.          Benefits. The Project would support the private sector and Government institutions in accelerating and
deepening resuctuning in the enterprise and financial sectors. This is critical for the success of economic stabilization
and transformation. First, the Project would reinforce enterprise-level adjustments. It would improve corporate



-6-
govemance throughi privatization; relievc the burdcn of the most indebted insolvent enterprises on banks and suppliers;
set precedentis for liquidation and for rclating bad debt rcsolution to rigorous restructuring of enterprises; build local
consulting capacity for enterprise restructuring; cnhance the know-how of company managcrs; and cnable banks to play
an important role in enterprise restructuring. Second, the Project would enhance the quality and quantity of banking
scrviccs, the prudence and financial discipline in banking, and the cfficient allocation of crcdit to viabic activities. The
payment system component would facilitate financial risk managcinent, reducc the float in the payments system, raise
the efficiency and accuracy of payments, and thereby stimulate commcrcial relations between enterprises. The Project
would help implement policics and institulion-building programs that were assessed and designcd under the Baik's
Technical Assistance Project.
27.          Risks. In a newly creatcd country undergoing fundamental economic transformation there is an inevitable
risk of policy changes and implementation delays, but these risks inherent in the project are worth taking given the
important rolc they will play in vhe implementation of critical struclural reform. Thc direction and speed of reform in
the financial and enterprise sectors are very encouraging, and proper extemal support will be cssential for its success.
Delays could occur in project implementation due to limited administrative capacity, unforeseen technical complexities,
or slowness in preparing and implementing economic reforms closely related to this Project. This risk would be reduced
through substantial assistance for Project implementation; close Project supervision; and some contractor payments being
tied to performance milestones.
K. Recommendation
28.            1 am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
