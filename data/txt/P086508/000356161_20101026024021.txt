RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase 2A

Mitigation Measures
During the process of determining project investment scale and method, a close co-ordination
between technical consultant (CDM Company, USA) and social consultant (Infra_Thanglong -
National Consultant) has been established to achieve 02 following objectives: Promote the
effectiveness of the investment project and minimize the land acquisition of landowners.
During the process of socio-economic survey and consultation of the project affected community,
the Consultant took measures to mitigate project impacts (by means of setting up proper resettlement
and compensation options and residents' consensus towards the Project), which include the
propaganda and community meetings to introduce the Project and the roles of residents during the
project preparation and implementation stage as well.
Simultaneously, measures to minimize temporary impacts in the construction stage was studied and
proposed to avoid or minimize the same impacts in the next stages.
    ,

Policy Framework and Entitlement
The basic principle applied for the RP preparation is: DPs shall be assisted together with their best
efforts to better or at least improve their living standards, their earning capacity and productivity
same as their prior living standards when the project was not started. The lack of legal basis of land
usage does not bar affected persons' entitlements to the compensation and/or assistance for their
economic restoration. Their affected properties shall be compensated based on "Replacement Costs".
The cut-off date of the project is the date when the project DMS completion, which is April 15th
2010 thus the cases arising after this date will be not be the project affected objects.

Rehabilitation Program

The life recovery program is one of the important activities in the implementation process of
compensation and resettlement. In the project, a vocational training program, job introduction by the
Da Nang Women's Employment Service Centre have been studied and proposed to apply to the
project affected persons, at the same time, a loan program under Component A-3 was proposed for
these subjects, partly contributing to helping people repair houses after acquisition and stabilize their
lives soon.                                                                                           .

Institutional Arrangement
The Project's compensation, assistance and resettlement will be under the management of the Project
Management Unit and the City Compensation and Resettlement Committee (CRC) will be directly
in charge of this work. In the implementation process, the close cooperation among site staffs,
DCRC, Project Management Unit, commune officers and residential groups as well as coordination
with resettlement specialists of the project in process of resettlement and compensation will be
carried out.

Implementation Plan

The RP will be implemented and completed before the construction of the project works started. It is
estimated that affected households will be compensated and carry out site clearance in the second
quarter of2011.

RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase 2A


Consultation and Participation
The Project's resettlement policy in this resettlement plan has been prepared with the close
cooperation of local authorities, community organizations, and DPs to maximize their participation
in the preparation and implementation of the resettlement plan. The local authorities, community
organizations and about over 300 affected households were consulted through different forms and
channels of information including meetings, community consultations, in-depth interviews for
typical cases and questionnaire survey for all project affected households. The information obtained
in the consultations is not only useful for building resettlement plan policy but also assists for setting
up of compensation options in the implementation process.

Monitoring and Evaluation
The.implementation of the detailed resettlement plan will be monitored and examined internally by
PMU's staffs. The implementation of resettlement plan will be also monitored frequently via the
prepared reports and the proposals. Arising and outstanding problems will be brought out to solve
absolutely.
At the same time, an independent monitoring organization will be employed to monitor the RP
implementation and evaluate the DP's living standards after resettlement.

Grievance and Grievance Redress
In the implementation process of the resettlement plan, grievances will be settled in accordance with
the procedure, which is approved in the resettleplent policy. The local authorities at all levels and
project staffs will resolve DPs' grievances fairly and quickly. DPs will not pay any administrative
fees for their grievance redress.

Cost Estimation
Total estimated cost of resettlement plan is 71,300,000,000 VND (Seventy-one billion, three hundred
million dong only). This includes compensation and allowance costs for project-affected land and
architectures, the income rehabilitation programs, the transition assistances, the monitoring,
evaluation and administrative management and contingency costs.

1.1    PROJECT OVERVIEW

1.1.,1 Introduction
Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project (PIIP) includes two stages. The preparation for
the investment of the first phase began in January 2007 and completed in June 2008. The
construction of Phase 1 began in May 2008 and is estimated to continue till June 2010. Phase 2
began in 1212009, when the International Consultancy CDM started and expected to end their job on
1112011.
The investment of infrastructure is expected to focus on six urban districts of Da Nang as shown in
the Picture below, which will also identify the project area.

RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase 2A



Project Objective
The project aims to upgrade the tertiary infrastructure for the low income community, provide
resettlement houses and micro-credit plan, and to improve dwelling for people. The infrastructure
investments will include flood control, new drainage system, wastewater collection, wastewater
pumping, wastewater treatment and building new roads and bridges in the urban area.
The main objectives are:
   Upgradipg the urban services effectively and sustainably;
   Improving the quality of life in low income areas;
   Promoting the social and economic development and expansion of urban space through the
    investment of strategic roads.
    ,
   Improving the urban environment and;
   Strengthening the management capacity of state departments and agencies.
As target platforms, Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project (PUP) aims at reducing
urban poverty and promo.ting economic development in the implementation of the Master Social-
Economic Development Plan of the City, the period until 2020, gradually building Da Nang into a
nuclear center of the Central Vietnam.
Project Components
The project includes four components and two phases below.
Component A - Upgrading the Tertiary Infrastructures in Low Income Areas
The participatory method similar to the one applied in the Vietnam Urban Upgrading Project will be
applied in this component. The upgrade ensures low-income population in urban areas to access
basic services. The tertiary infrastructure will include expanding and asphalting the road, newly
building or upgrading the wastewater and storm-water sewerage system, the water supply
connections in new households, local solid waste transferring stations (waste collection), public
lighting as well as upgrading such social infrastructures as clinics, kindergartens, market places and
other similar works. Some first and secondary infrastructures outside the area like entrances (paths),
main drainage systems may be built to complete the tertiary infrastructures in low-income areas.
The project will finance the regional development, development of residential areas used as the
resettlement for project affected people. Da Nang City has policy to temporarily lease houses for
project affected people while awaiting the completion of resettlement areas.
Phase 2, Component A will continue upgrading services in 10 low-income areas in the list of 14
areas which were selected at the pre-feasibility study stage. The full community survey and
community upgrading plans in these areas are also deployed.
Component B- Upgrading Environment Infrastructures: Wastewater Drainage, Collection and
Treatment
This Component will provide infrastructural investments for environmental improvement, such as
preventing flood in low-lying areas and dredging protection embankment for drainag.e canals. Also it
aims to reduce environmental pollution by upgrading the drainage systems and wastewater
collection, transportation and treatment systems (including family connections) through the

RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase 2A

investments in new sewers and combined sewer-ditch systems, wastewater canals, pumping stations,
pressure pipes and wastewater treatment plants. The upgrading drainage systems are possibly
supported by flood controlling measures leading to lakes scattered in urban areas and prone-flood
areas.
Component C - Construction of Urban Bridges and Roads
This component will finance the strategic infrastructure for economic development, and will include
(i) expansion of Nguyen Tri Phuong road from southern city to Tran Dai Nghia road and, (ii)
upgrading the new urban road linking Highway lA to Tran Dai Nghia, southern city (the expected
southern ramp).
The project preparation also requires two or three bid packages, bridge and road works for the
proposed southern road linking Highway lA and Tran Dai Nghia road and Phuoc Hoa Bridge.
Component D - Strengthening Capacity and Supporting the Project Implementation
This Component will support the project sustainability through funding training courses and
providing equipment for urban state agencies, which are benefited from the project investment.

1.1.2   Study Scope of Phase 2A
The preparation of the project resettlement report is divided into two (2) phases; (i) Phase 2a is
mainly for the works of Component Band C and (ii) Phase 2b is mainly for the works of Component
A and part of Component B & C. Accordingly, the categories of works under Phase 2A are as
follows:
Component B: The storm-water drainage sys~m in Lien Chieu and Son Tra districts: (1) Lien
Chieu district includes three main works: (i) Hoa Minh - Hoa Khanh residential population, (ii) Hoa
Minh - opened canal new railway station, and (iii) Ho Tay lake - Phu Loc river culvert (2), Son Tra
District includes two main works (i) Tho Quang ward - Bien Dong culvert which originally passes
the low area of Nguyen Phan Vinh road to Sluice Gate CX 16 of Son Tra-Dien Ngoc road (the box
culvert from Nguyen Phan Vinh road to Sluice Gate CX 16) and (ii) Tho Quang -Man Thai wards-
Bien Dong culvert which originally supplies water for the southern residential area of Phan Ba Phien
road to Sluice Gate CX 25.
Component C: The extension Nguyen Tri Phuong - Tran Dai Nghia road (bridge and road), where
the beginning point intersects Nguyen Tri Phuong and Cach Mang Thang Tam road (August
Revolutionary Road) in Khue Trung ward, Cam Le district and the ending point intersects Tran Dai
Nghia at Km 6 +534 in Hoa Quy ward, Ngu Hanh Son district. Besides, three bridges will be built
including (i) Bridge 1 (825m long, KmO +626), (ii) Bridge 2 (110m long, Km2 +162) and (iii)
Bridge 3 (343m long, Km2 +940).

1.1.3 Main Assignments
In Phase 2A, the work scope includes (i) update the socioeconomic information (ii) preparation of
resettlement plan report, specifically:
Update the socioeconomic information: a socio-economic survey in the project area was conducted
in 2006-2007, which reviewed impacts of the selected investment components on the communities
and population groups benefited from the project. The main works that require land acquisition in

     RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase 2A

     Phase 2 will be surveyed through the review of the reports completed in Phase 1 and determination
     of update information level, which is primarily focused on Component C of the project.
     Preparation of the Resettlement Plan: The investment components, especially the tertiary
     infrastructural improvements and construction of road class 1, are estimated to cause certain social
     impacts. Among them, special attention to low-income areas, ethnic minority groups (if any) and
     vulnerable groups must be paid. Although the impacts are very ~iverse, a resettlement plan report
     shall coyer detailed descriptions of the impacts, benefit policies, rehabilitation assistances to ensure
     the improvement or at least maintenance of the living standard of households as compared to their
..   pre-condition of the project implementation. The resettlement plan report is prepared to ensure the
     compliance with the approved project policy framework and in appropriate with the current policies
     ofDa Nang city.

     1.1.4 Executed Resettlement Plans
        ,
     The resettlement action plan reports under various project stages have been implemented including:
     Phase 1: Phase 1 started in 2008 and is under the construction, including the construction of Thanh
     Khe Tay resettlement area, Hoa Minh resettlement area, Hoa Quy resettlement area and other low-
     income areas as Xuan Hoa A, Thanh Khe 1 & Xuan Hoa A, Thanh Khe 5, Chau Thanh and Trung
     Tam, and the environmental improvement of Phu Loc River. A resettlement plan report was
     prepared by SECO Consultant in 2007, which estimates approximately 671 affected households, of
     which 236 households must resettle and cost for relocation, compensation and assistance is VND
     108.7 billion.
     Phase 2A: Phase 2A of the project includes the construction of (i) Component B: drainage works of
     Lien Chieu, Son Tra districts and Component C: Nguyen Tri Phuong - Tran Dai Nghia extended
     road (bridge and road). A resettlement plan report is expected to complete in September 2010.
     Phase 2B: Phase 2B of the project includes the construction of (i) Component B: Tertiary
     infrastructure upgrading of 10 LIAs; and Component B: rainwater drainage system in the centers of
     Hai Chau and Thanh Khe districts, expanding the wastewater systems in Son Tra, Cam Le, Lien
     Chieu district, first and secondary drainage systems connected to the LIAs and wastewater treating
     plants (including construction and upgrading) and (iii) Component C: Ring Road south of Da Nang
     city (bridges and road). A resettlement plan report is expected to complete in December 2010. .
     This resettlement plan report is developed for Phase 2A, whose preparation and site survey began
     from March 2010 and is expected to end in August 2010. It is submitted to the WB in late April
     2010 and expected to be cleared in September 2010. Details of investigation, survey and report
     content are presented in Section 1.3: Survey and Investment.


     1.2    INVESTIGATION AND SURVEY
     During the period from 09/3/2010 to 15/4/2010, a socio-economic investigation and affected asset
     survey were conducted. Accordingly, all affected households were preliminary surveyed, in which
     156 households (estimated 40% affected households) were investigated by socioeconomic
     questionnaires and all relocated households and severely affected households were investigated by
     consultation meetings. Steps for investigation, survey and consultation with affected communities
     are expressed as follows:

        mv~stment components and to map for the entire route of the Project - Phase 2A projects
        while conduct field surveys to take measures to minimize the land acquisition and
        resettlement impacts (if any). => Details are shown in Chapter 2: Mitigation Measures.
       Map the affected areas in order to demonstrate the typesllevels of impact associated with the
        relevant information of the economic and social survey and asset inventory.
        Conduct an inventory of affected land/property over (100%) households and a
         socioeconomic survey for 20% of partially affected households and 100% seriously affected
         and displaced households, thereby to establish an economic and social database report
        ,(enclosed with the resettlement plan report) :=> see Chapter 3 and 4 for more details: Land
         acquisition, resettlement and economic and social information;
   JI   Investigate replacement costs by ways of the collection of compensation unit price issued by
        Da Nang People's Committee, collection of information on real estate transactions over the
        city (in or nearby the project area), collection of quotations on the propertieslbuilding
        materials ... and in the consultation process, consult people on compensation rates applied in
        their locality => for more details see Chapter 13: Cost Estimate for Compensation, Assistance
        and Resettlement.
       Organize consultations with the community and stakeholders such as unions, community
        representatives and affected households (applicable to all displaced and affected households).
        In addition, consultations with the PMU staffs have been conducted to discuss and agree the
        contents mentioned in the report, focusing on the investigation and survey of replacement
        costs and livelihood rehabilitation programs of affected households ... => for more details see
        Chapter 10: Community Consultation and Participation.

     2.1'   OBJECTIVES
     The first principle of WB' s resettlement guideline is to avoid or mitigate impacts on resettlement and
     land acquisition. In case it is not feasible to avoid such resettlement, mitigation methods and/or
     reasonable compensation should be applied for DPs.
                              -
     As unified in the implementation principles of Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project,
     the resettlement and land acquisition should be minimized. The Designed Consultant CDM, PMU
     and related authorities have made efforts to minimize impacts on land acquisition since the stage of
     project design and completion of the investment report; therefore, the impact scale on resettlement is
     limited.
     Unavoidable land acquisition impacts are caused by the need of land acquisition for the construction
     of extended Nguyen Tri Phuong road (in 04 wards ofKhue Trung - Hoa Xuan (Cam Le district) and
     Hoa Quy - Hoa Hai (Ngu Hanh Son District) and the renovation and construction of the drainage
     systems in Lien Chieu and Son Tra districts .... Wide-range consultations between the resettlement
     consultant (Infra-Thanglong) and local authorities, community-based organizations and especially
     households, who may be affected by the project, were organized to minimize resettlement impacts.
     The agreed instruction principles are attempts to finalize optimal options and solutions to avoid
     moving residents from their existing shelters.


     2.2    MITIGATION MEASURES
     In the project design process, the close coordination between Resettlement Consultant and the
     technical team of CDM Consultant in an effort to mitigate the project impact have been made.
     Thereby the plan of building culverts under the existing roads will not affect households and has no
     permanent land acquisition. Households will be temporarily affected during the construction period.
     However, the percentage of temporarily affected households accounts for small numbers in this
     resettlement plan report. For the construction works of extended Nguyen Tri Phuong road and newly
     building or renovating canals of Lien Chieu, Son Tra districts, regardless of many mitigation
     measures (such as building culverts on the existing canals and building box culverts beneath the
     roads ... ) some cases of partly affected houses are inevitably. Therefore, in order to minimize
      impacts on these families, including those whose houses are partly or indirectly affected during the
     construction, the following mitigation measures were applied:

     Infra-Tbanglong                                                                             18175
RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase 2A

   1. Firstly, the fIrst action of project impact mitigation is to help households get infonnation
      locations and benefIts of the project as well as estimated impacts in order to establish
      together a suitable policy framework for minimizing impacts. On the other hand, if
      households are provided with full infonnation in this stage, they will have spiritual and
      physical preparation for expected project impacts. The community consultations in the whole
      project area were carried out to publicize (i) project infonnation and (ii) expected impacts as
      well as land acquisition and resettlement compensation methods. In the consultancy
      meetings, many opinions were exchanged. In general, people supported the Project and
      hoped that it will be soon accomplished to solve the flooding situation in the area.
   2. Secondly, for the design of extended Nguyen Tri Phuong road, immediately during the route
      identifIcation and preliminary design, an appropriate technical plan has been proposed to
      avoid residential areas. Avoiding impacts are the most feasible measures to minimize the
      project negative impacts effectively and solve the root of adverse effects. In case of
      inevitable negative effects on property, adequate compensation policy and compensation
      value guarantying restoration of the damages at least will be given in consistent with the
      project RPF.
   3. Thirdly, for the box culverts - most box culverts have been studied and put in the middle of
      the road to minimize direct impacts to households living on both roadsides such as the
      construction of box-culverts in Minh Hoa - Khanh Hoa residential area of Lien Chieu district,
      the box-culverts on Phan Ba Phien road, Son Tra district. Accordingly, remaining impacts
      after the application of mitigation methods are only temporary impacts in the construction
      process, especially on the access to business facilities of households living on two roadsides.
      In addition, as a result of the expected dimensions of box culverts in the project area, the land
      acquisition for these culverts ranges from 2.5-4.0m while road width ranges from 6- 6.5m.
      However, in order to minimize impacts on households living along the roadsides,
      consultation meetings were held with households living in these wards to get their supports
      on the construction process. Some temporary impacts (on traffic, business, etc.) will be
      minimized by the Contractor, in a close cooperation with the community, based on (i)
      notifying the Contractor's construction plan so that residents can make necessary and suitable
      arrangements; (ii) the construction activities should fInished one by one with
      fencing/excavation section by section to minimize affects on traffic and business activities' of
      households.
   4. Fourthly, the improvement of opened canal alignments are studied and proposed to minimize
      impacts by means of the option of box culvert construction and creating upper traffic lane
      like the culvert alignments in Tho Quang ward, Son Tra district. Where it is feasible for land
      acquisition, stone embankments will be built and canal will be widened.
   5. Fifthly, in some drainage alignments, which have been mentioned in the feasibility study
      report and approved in January 2008, there are many changes now because local people and
      organizations in the area have built many works... therefore to minimize impacts on land
      acquisition and resettlement, the design consultant CDM should review the current status of
      these works to suggest more appropriate locations (if any). The box culverts from Nguyen
      Phan Vinh road to Sluice Gate CX16 in Tho Quang ward may affect about 30 households, of
      which about 11 households are relocated. Through fIeld survey, the construction position of
      the culvert alignment will be adjusted to minimize resettlement of about eight households

RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase 2A

       adjacent to Sluice Gate CX16. This is one of the mitigation measures of land acquisition and
       resettlement of the project.
   6. Sixthly, during construction, there will be negative impacts to the people's lives in the area
      like repairing partly affected houses. The technical team has been discussed and worked with
      to find out mitigation measures such as to complete the construction section by section. For
      the materials generated in the dismantlement of th~ architectural works, the Contractors are
      r~quested to quickly clean-up and move them out of the area.

   7. Finally, many meetings were held with the technical group to determine locations of drainage
      alignments and establish criteria of impact mitigation during the construction such as setting
       up working safety plans (when constructing near residential areas), making proper
      'arrangement of materials and instruments (project sign boards, making partitions with
      residential areas, etc.), and preparing construction schedule to minimize temporary impacts.
In die next stage of the project, further mitigation measures should be continued to propose solutions
for negative impacts on society and culture, the penetration of social evils, increasing traffic
accidents after the project is put into operation ... There will be specific action plans and clear
implementation mechanisms (if any, by CMC Contracts) to increase awareness or at least retain
people's accessibility to the existing systems and enhance benefit capacity from the project to local
people.

    The DPs will be fully compensated and assisted in accordance with RPF agreed between the
    Vietnamese Government and World Banle

    3.1.2 Affected Area
    Based on the preliminary design, the project is implemented in 2 phases. This report show the
    project impacts in Phase 2A, including 7 wards of 4 districts:
          o Ngu Hanh Son district: Hoa Quy wards and Hoa Hai ward
          o Cam Le district: Khue Trung ward and Hoa Xuan ward
          o Lien Chieu district: Hoa Minh ward and Hoa Khanh Nam ward
          <? Son Tra district: Tho Quang ward
t
    In addition to the mentioned direct affects, the project also cause temporary impacts to over 200
    households living along the routes of Nguyen Phan Vinh and Phan Ba Phien, along the existing
    canals/ditches ... in the construction process. These impacts primarily prevent/limit few households
    from indirectly temporarily accessing their business facilities during the Project construction period,
    where the road is closed and the traffic is cramped. The issue will be reported in the construction
    contract to minimize the impact that if the construction time is prolonged, the contractor (s) will be
    responsible for compensating the impacts.


    3.2      INVENTORY OF PROJECT AFFECTED PROPERTIES
    Based on the technical design, the typical cross section (1) of Component C: Nguyen Tri Phuong
    extended road, (2) Component B: Storm-water drainage systems of Lien Chieu district, Son Tra
    district, including box culverts/opening canals of Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project,
    Phase 2A. The Project works may affect 07 wards in four districts, in which the impact area is
    divided into two main categories (i) land arealland acquisition work by other projects and (ii) land
    arealland acquisition work by Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project. The area,which
    has been acquired by other projects, includes:
         1) Nguyen Tri Phuong - Tran Dai Nghia route affects the land acquisition of four wards,
             including Hoa Xuan, Hoa Quy, Hoa Hai, Khue Trung, in which Hoa Xuan was compensated
             by the Ecoregion urban Project invested by the Land Management and Exploitation
             Company according to decision No 35811QD-UBND dated May 5th, 2008 on land
             acquisition, handing over for the Land Management and Exploitation Company to implement
             City planning (the Compensation Department No.2 carries out the statistics and
             compensation). The acquisition land area is about 330,000m2 and the number of affected
             households is estimated about 230 households, whose are mainly affected with agricultural
             land. The Land Management and Exploitation Company will hand over this area to construct
             Nguyen Tri Phuong - Tran Dai Nghia road
         2) The box culverts in Hoa Minh - Hoa Khanh residential area and the box culverts from Ho
             Tay to Phu Loc River have been built by the Northwest New Urban Area Project (Lien Chieu

           2008. The Northwest New Urban Area Project is responsible for handing over the area to the
           Project.
    The land areas acquired by another projects is reviewed thoroughly, that a Resettlement Due
    Diligence report will be prepared separately and enclosed with the report, as Appendix 4:
    Resettlement Due Diligence Report. For the land area which has not been acquired, the inventory,
    survey has been conducted to determine the amount of land/asset impacts; details of impacts are
    shown in the table below.

    3.2.1 Impacts ofResidential Land Acquisition
    As stated, thanks to the approach of land acquisition and resettlement mitigation in the project design
    stage, the number of resettled households is minimized. However, there are 108 households residing
    in the site clearance area will be affected with total 27,958m2 of residential land to be permanently
    acq~red, of which 83 households have to be resettled. There is no temporary residential land
    acquisition in this project, phase 2a.

     The table shows that the affected volume of agricultural land for the entire project concentrates in
     Hoa Quy and Hoa Hai ward, where there is the construction of extended Nguyen Tri Phuong road.
     Households living here are suburban residents and their income is primarily from cultivation, so the
     land acquisition will cause certain impacts on their livelihoods and income sources. Thus, in addition
     to the compensation and assistance following the requirements of the approved Policy Framework,
     such life recovery programs as vocational training, vocational guiding and loans for business and
     production will be provided to assist households' early adaptability with the new living environment
     and to improve their income.

            3.2.5 Impacts on Trees and Farming Products
            In Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project, not many cases are affected with plants and crops and agricultural land
            because the project mainly locates in the urban areas. Afew routes as Nguyen Tri Phuong, the Opened canal ill Lien Chieu district
            affect industrial plants and ornamental plants ... but the affected volume is not significantly.

     3.2.4 Impacts on Other Works 1
     In Nguyen Tri Phuong route, Hoa Quy ~ Hoa Hai section, the project affects a cemetery where
     an estimate of 850 graves will be moved for the project construction. According to the
     discussions with local authorities, due to the large affected volume of graves, the planning of the
     graveyard should be consulted with the superior authorities (district or city level), but the
     current plan is to move the graves into Hoa Son cemetery of the city which are acceptable with
     DPs during compensation community consultations.
     Besides, no local cultural, religious works are affected by the Project. The table below shows the
     land acquisition impact summary of the Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project
     (PUP Da nang), Phase 2A .

      Regarding who decide the expenditure in families, 44.5% of interviewees said the wives give
      the final decisions and 38.5% said both wives and husbands give the decisions.
      Households' Savings: In the total surveyed households, the majority of households said that
      within their earnings and the inflated, basically they could not have savings and their extra
      income just knits part of their family spending rather than the savings.
      In summary, the people's living standard in the project area is basically medium, estimated
       18% of households living in difficulty and as poor households because their income is mainly
      depended on agricultural production in addition to the difficult condition ofthe suburbs of the

      On water supply, most households are using water from drilled or excavated wells,
      accounting for 79.5% and these households are in Hoa Hai ward, Hoa Quy ward ofNgu Hanh
      Son district. Just over 19% of households use tap water, concentrating in Tho Quang ward
      (Son Tra district) and Hoa Khanh Nam ward (Lien Chieu district). The use of rain water and

RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase 2A


Main Gaps between Viet Nam and World Bank Policy
There are a number of ways in which the approaches of the Vietnam Government - either in
policy or practice - are compatible with the World Bank guidelines. The most important
compatibilities are:
     On the issue of land tenure and the legal right to compensation, the Government and
      World Bank approaches are compatible. Vietnam has a process whereby people
      without legal land rights may meet conditions of legalization and receive
      compensation for losses up to a rate equal to 100% of land price minus the taxes and
      fee for land use right registration from 15 October 1993 (Article 42,49 and 50 of2003
      Land Law)
     Permanent residents are provided with options that include relocation to an improved
      site, or cash, or a combination of the two
     Resettlement sites offer not only better improved infrastructure and services but
      represent a higher standard of living
     Allowances are provided to help the DPs in the transition period and there is an
      institutional structure through which people are informed, can negotiate
      compensation, and can appeal.
     Compensation at replacement cost is ensured in Article 6 of Decree 197120041ND-CP
      dated December 3rd, 2004 that " ... people who have land being acquired shall be
      compensated with land of similar land use purpose. If there is no land for
      compensation, cash compensation equal to land use rights value at the time of land
      acquisition shall be applied. If there is many differences in value, in case of
      compensation by new land or house, such difference shall be settled in cash" and
      Article 19 in the same Decree states that " ... house and structure of domestic use of
      household or individual shall be compensated with the value of construction of new
      house, structures of similar technical standard".
However, with the promulgation of the 2003 Land Law and the adoption of Decrees No.
197/20041ND-CP and No. 18812004IND-CP, Decree 17/20061ND-CP, Decree 84/20071ND-
CP, and Decree 69120091ND-CP the policies and practices of the Government have become
more consistent with WB's social safeguards policies. Nonetheless, provisions and principles
adopted to the project will supersede the provisions of relevant decrees currently in force in
Viet Nam wherever a gap exists, consistent with Decree No. 131120061ND-CP on ODA
management. The main gaps between national policy and OP 4.12 on involuntary
resettlement of the World Bank are as follows.
      The 'significance' of impact is triggered by a loss of 30 per cent or more agricultural
       land in Decree 197, in the RPF the trigger is a loss of 20 per cent or more of
       productive land/assets.
      Houses and structures will not be compensated if they have been constructed without
       permission, constructed in contravention of a land use plan, or if they have encroached
       upon a demarcated safety protection corridor. However. they will be supported up to
       80 per cent of their value or compensation rate if they have been built on land that is
       ineligible for compensation;
      Decree 197 recognizes businesses or economic entities DPs as only if they hold a
       business certificate (Le. excludes non-registered businesses);
      Decree 197 recognizes DPs losing employment only on a permanent basis (i.e if they
       are made redundant) and only if the DPs has an employment contract and is employed
       by a business or economic entity holding a business certificate;

             Under Decree 197, assistance for occupational change and job creation is only
              provided to DPs engaged directly in agricultural production and in cases where more
              than 30 per cent of their agricultural land is affected;
             The requirements for consultation in the Land Law and Decree 197 are limited to
              "informing" DPs rather than providing information and seeking feedback from those
              directly affected; and


     5.2      PRINCIPLES OF EGlLffiILITY AND COMPENSATION
     ,5.2.1 Objective
     The objectives of the Vietnamese law on resettlement and rehabilitation for relocated people
     and compulsory resettlement objectives of the World Bank are applied to finalize the
     resettlement policy framework. The policies and principles applicable to the Project are based
     on the policies of the World Bank (OPIBP 4.12) and the current regulations of Vietnam.
     The main objective of the resettlement policy framework is "to ensure all project affected
     persons receive the compensation respective with the replacement prices and the support
     policies that help them restore, improve their living standard or at least maintain their living
     conditions and earning capacity same as the time prior to the Project".

     5.2.2 Project Displaced Persons
,"   Project affected persons (APs) are those who suffer from:
           (i) Involuntary land acquisition resulting, in:

..            (a)
              (b)
                      relocation or loss of shelter;
                      loss of assets or access to assets;
              (c)     loss of income sources or means of livelihood, whether they must move to a
                      new residence or not; or
           ii) Involuntary restriction of access to prohibited or protected forests, resulting in adverse
               impacts to their means of support of the displaced persons.

     5.2.3 Cut-off date
     A valid time for receiving compensation and assistance for each resettlement plan is the date
     that the project or specific project components are formally approved and published by the

      6.1    RESETTLEMENT NEEDS
iii
      'According to the survey results, there is the total of 83 households in need of resettlement
.      (moving houses) to facilitate the project implementation successfully, including:
      The Storm-water Drainage System in Lien Chieu District: This opened canal system passes
      two wards of Hoa Minh and Hoa Khanh Nam, however, the effects of land acquisition
      focuses on Hoa Khanh Nam ward. Total of 12 households must relocate for the project
      implementations, which are living along the existing canals.
      The Storm-water Drainage System in Son Tra District: The drainage system here is
      inclusive of box culverts, collecting wastewater from the roads of Nguyen Phan Vinh and
      Phan Ba Phien to discharge the Sluice Gates: CX 16, CX25. For culverts connecting Sluice
      Gate CX 16, owing to the mitigation measures, the Project only affects 03 households locating
      next to the existing canal. Separately, the box culvert route starting from Phan Ba Phien road
      to Sluice Gate CX25 basically affects 13 households, who are totally affected and must
      resettle.
      Nguyen Tri Phuong Link Road: This route runs through 04 wards of Cam Le and Ngu
      Hanh Son districts, where the effects related to land acquisition have been done by other
      projects, there is only an estimate of 55 affected households whose houses are affected and
      must move, including 13 cases in Khue Trung ward, 25 cases in Hoa Quy ward and 17 cases
      in Hoa Hai ward.


      6.2    COMMUNITY CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION
      The resettlement for households who are totally cleared is based the following order:
               Households who belong to the relocation and resettlement are consulted about
               resettlement areas;
               Disclosure the detail design of resettlement areas;
               Distribute land plots and/or apartments in resettlement areas on the principle of
               consultation of affected households;
               Move households to resettlement areas and launch rehabilitation measures for their
               lives
      Certain consultation contents about resettlement options are as bellow:
      As the result of the survey by questionnaires and community consultations, some comments
      and viewpoints of local people are as follows.
      Compensation and Resettlement: People said the land acquisition and site clearance is quite
      common, even in their hometown other projects are carrying out the land acquisition and site

      clearance. Therefore, local officials and citizens understand quite clearly the procedures as
      well as the meanings and roles of this work.
      In fact, when a project is implemented, people firstly concern about the level of compensation
      and assistance. They hope the state has such compensation policies that they are not much
 i
      disadvantageous. This shows clearly during the Consultant's survey in the project
 ..   wards/communes, where 70.8% households want the Project's satisfactory compensation
      policy. Because of no trust and having common cognition and viewpoint to the "projectless"
      status (or suspended project), people want the Project to be commenced soon to avoid their
      risks of investing in land; 94.3% households want the advantageous resettlement points to
      limit their living disorders. In addition to the stipulated compensation rates, people also want
      more assistance for their lives stabilization after the project implementation.
.     Expectations for the resettlement plan: This is a focus; most households (more or less
      affected) are very interested in the compensation rates. Regarding the resettlement locations,
      people want that the Project builds on-site resettlement areas (at the local precinct), which
..    will not cause effects, disruption to people's lives, particularly for their social relations and
      lifestyles.
      According to the survey results, people generally tend to the land plots in resettlement areas
      of the city where the basic infrastructures are established. Receiving such land plots, people
      will be more active in their coordination, settlement as well as seeking other business
      opportunities to maintain their lives. However, in reality of discussion, they also wish in-site
      resettlement if their remaining area can be settled down. Additionally, there is number of
      people who wants receiving compensation money and manages their accommodations by
      themselves but these cases are not significant (1.4%). Thus about 98.6% relocated households
      agreed and be willing to resettle in three resettlement areas of the project. The households
      (said 1.4%), who do not agree to relocate to the above resettlement areas, the City People's
      Committee will issue commitments to arrange them in other resettlement areas on the
      district/ward.
      Besides, there are certain consultation contents about resettlement options as bellow:
              Firstly, people generally understand the value and benefits brought by the Project, so
              they agreed with the projects and activities related to site clearance and resettlement.
              Secondly, locals desire new resettlement areas near their old residence or within the
              ward precincts. Thus, the habits, the customs and the participation in the activities of
              the resident groups in the community will not be disturbed; the cultural aspects,
              community relations will not change much ...
              Thirdly, people want the resettlement areas to be completed and handed over to them
              before acquiring their land. The technical and social infrastructures in the resettlement
              areas must be complete before handing resettlement land to relocated households.
              Fourthly, because most households living in the project area are middle and wealthy
              families, they want the Project having additional supports in the house construction
              and reconstruction in the resettlement areas. They hope that the compensation and
              assistance costs will be enough to cover their restoration of life in the new place.
      In addition, the households also raised many questions about the compensation unit prices
      and support regime for poor urban people and the project's criteria for the resettlement of
      households whose agricultural land is severely affected ...

     6.3         DEVELOPMENT OF RESETTLEMENT SITE

     6.3.1 Availability of the Resettlement Sites
     Currently, the resettlement home fund is being built in three areas including (i) Thanh Khe
     Tay Resettlement Area, (ii) Hoa Minh Resettlement Area and (ii) Hoa Quy Resettlement
     Area. The detail scale of the resettlement areas are shown below (description of the
     r~settlement sites, refer to the project F/S, phase 1):

           .:.    Thanh Khe Tay Resettlement Area: This area is 5.18 hectares wide with total 111
                  land plots and 66 apartments, of which 91 plots and 38 apartments were allocated
                  for resettlement households in Phase 1. Currently, there are 20 land plots and 28
                  apartments available in Thanh Khe Tay resettlement area.
           :.    Hoa Minh Resettlement Area: This area is 7.18 hectares wide with total 209 land
                  plots and 132 apartments, of which 107 plots and 6 apartments were allocated for
                  resettlement households in Phase 1. Currently, there are 102 land plots and 126
                  apartments available in Hoa Minh resettlement area.
..         :.    Hoa Quy Resettlement Area: This area is 5.9 hectares wide with total 266 land
                  plots, of which 02 plots were allocated for resettlement households in Phase 1.
                  Currently, there are 102 land plots and apartments available in Hoa Quy
                  resettlement area.
     In sum, the three resettlement areas of Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project
     have 386 land plots and 154 apartments to arrange for affected households in Phase 2A and
     2B.
     According to the above data on the resettlement home fund and based on the resettlement
..   demand in Project Phase 2A, we can be seen that the resettlement home fund is able to meet
     the resettlement need of the resettled households. Resettlement arrangements for individual
     household in total 83 households will be implemented by the Project Management Unit based
     on the agreed resettlement registration process.

     6.3.1 Resettlement Arrangement
     As noted above, 83 estimated households are resettled for the project implementation and
     according to the project progress; the project construction will be started in the fist quarter
     2012. Thus, the land acquisition and resettlement for these households must be completed in
     June to September 2011 (03 months before the project implementation). To ensure the
     progress, right from this moment the Project Management Unit (and concerned agencies)
     should take necessary activities for land acquisition and resettlement soon.
     As a result of the consultations, most households are keen for resettlement land plots. So for
     such cases, prior to making procedures of land acquisition and resettlement, the PMU (or

...   7.1    OVERVIEW
      Restoring life is an important part of the resettlement when DPs lost production and business
      facilities, employment, or other sources of income, whether they lost their homes or not.
      However, damaged cases of housing and income sources are subjects to have highest risks
      caused by the project. When the project effects to people are negative, people may be worse
      off and bankruptcy of the resources to create life. This can lead to loss of land, loss of job,
      loss of homes, to b~ separated from the social marginalization, illness, lack of food, loss of
      the use-right of public properties and they are at the risk of becoming social order disturbing
      elements, including crimes and thieves. Therefore, measures to restore life are the core of the
      resettlement and require maximum attention. Measures to restore life will be designed with
      extensive consultation from the project affected persons. The general purpose of this program
      is to restore the livelihoods of affected persons same as or higher the rate before there is the
      implementation of the Project, and will ensure that affected people adapt to new conditions in
      shortest time.
      Recovery of income are taken into account as an important part in the consideration of
      livelihood accessibility or improvement of the DPs's economic circumstances, which aims to
      improve skills or to create more opportunities for poor households, households with difficult
      economic circumstances and households belonging to the vulnerable groups.
      To perform the next step of the Resettlement Plan (RP), the Project Management Unit of Da
      Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project will combine with local government agencies
      at all levels such as the social organizations: Da Nang Women's Employment Service Center,
      Da Nang Employment Center ... to conduct the operations to restore DPs' incomes. The
      activities here are mainly vocational training, loan provision and job introduction which are
      free of charge for those who are acquired land by projects in the Oa nang city. The specific
      contents, forms and schedules of implementation are shown below.


      7.2    ANALYSIS OF DEMAND
      According to the survey results, there are 108 households whose landlhouses and other works
      and structures are affected, including 83 relocated households. In addition, there are 263
      households, whose agricultural land is affected, including 193 heavily affected households
      (losing 20% or more of agricultural land). The affected households here mainly earn for
      living by agricultural works along the proposed road or the canal routes. According to the
      survey, an estimate of 51% household's occupations are currently agriculture, and together
      with other secondary jobs (about 85% out of said agricultural households); that their income

     general, DPs mostly live in the suburban, which are in the urbanization conversion process.
     The DPs have been consulted and investigated through the questionnaires and community
     consultations, their views and opinions to the life restoration after resettlement is shown as

     ,significant impacts on their lives. Namely, about 35.8% households will have no land for
     production; 36.6% said the project will disturb their family life; 12.9% said their family

     7.3     PROPOSAL OF LIFE RECOVERY PROGRAM
     7.3.1 Budget Source
     Income recovery is seen as an especial component if affected households can recover their
     sources of income or improve their economic situation. People with low incomes are defined
     as those who do not have skills or opportunities to improve their earning. The resettlement
     program looks for optimistic possibilities to ensure that all resettlement areas are in such
     positions that create favorable conditions for improvement of DPs' skills and income
     increase, or ideally it can combine both the improvement oftheir skills and income increase.
     Budget for the life recovery program will be taken from the city counterpart fund and is
     attached in the total compensation cost of the project.

RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase lA




                  CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION

10.1   OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The major objectives of the consultation and participation are:
   a) Ensure that affected people and involved parties have their voice in the making decisions
      of all compulsory resettlement issues related to them;
   b) Minimize adverse effects caused by compulsory resettlement;
   c) Avoid conflicts occurring in the process of project implementation.
It is regulated in WB's policy that DPs shall be informed and consulted fully on the resettlement
and compensation plans. Consultation for DPs is the starting point for all resettlement activities.
DPs may worry about losses of subsistence means and community or worry that they are not
ready for complicated negotiations on their entitlements. Participating in the resettlement plan
preparation and management brings opportunities for DPs to participate in the decisions of what
will affect their lives. The resettlement implementation without the community consultancy may
lead to an improper and ineffective strategy. Without consultancy, DPs may protect again the
project and create social difficulties to remarkably prevent the project from objective completion
and even make the project cost increased. Therefore, if there is the consultation, the initial
objection about project may be changed to the constructive consultation.
In Vietnam, one next step in the democracy increase at basic level is Instruction No.30-CTrrW
of the Central Committee of Vietnamese Communist Party in "Construction and implementation
of basic democratic regime" and Decree No.79/2003/ND-CP on this matter. The key of the legal
documents is the well-known sentence: "people know, people discuss people do, people check".
Ordinance No.34/2007IPL-UBTVQHll points out that the local authorities and communities
have opinions prior to the authorized agencies' making decision; including the establishment of
compensation and resettlement plans relating to the projects and works in ward/commune areas.
Article 39, clause 2, Land law 2003 requests to open the matters relating resettlement such as
reasons, land acquisition plans, relocation plans, general compensation plans, and land

     consultation meetings inclusive of the resettlement policy framework were held in the project
     wards, residential areas". Representatives of households who are definitely affected by the project
     were invited to attend and give comments in the meetings. The local governments and residents
     were consulted on their agreement and commitment to the resettlement policy described in the
     project policy framework, which is considered as the policy reflecting the objectives and policies
     of the Work Bank and the Government of Vietnam. After the Project is approved, the
     information on the objectives, components and activities of the project have been widely
     introduced in the public places.

     public consultations (group discussions with communities affected by the project) to gather such
     qualitative information as demographic status, income sources, compensation expectations and
     compensation rates, demand for vocational training and loan revolving fund

The method used for valuation of losses in the WB projects is based on the "REPLACEMENT
COST". In this Project, the losses consist of damages to urban land, structures and other assets.
Urban land of the same area and using value should be determined by replacement costs in the
consideration of the public structures and social services plus registration costs and transferable
taxes. For houses associated with other structures, their value is determined by market prices of
building materials to build a replacement house of the same area and quality at least, or to repair
the affected structures, plus transport material costs, labor costs, bidding cost, registration fees
and transferable taxes. Asset depreciation and material value that can be salvaged by affected

      RESETTLEMENT PLAN - Phase 2A


      Through the review of Da Nang's new compensation policy for architectural works, the PMU
      proposed the compensation unit prices for architectural works, properties on land in the project
      area accordingly to Decision No.36/2009/QD-UBND on 2411212009 by Da Nang People's
      Committee relating unit prices of houses and structures, graves, plus 20% inflation for such
      architectural objects. The prices for architectural items and the compensation prices for trees and
      crops are in the attached appendix. Based on the proposed rates, the estimated cost for
      compensation and assistance shall be determined in the following pages: Cost Estimate.


      13.3    COST ESTIMATE
      Costs for compensation and resettlement including RP preparation and implementation costs and
...
      administrative and management costs are estimated based on the following items8:
             The costs for affected land and property compensation in the project area;
             The costs for the program of income restoration and special support for vulnerable groups
              (policy families, families deserving for the revolutions, family owned by women,
              disabled people, poor households etc.);
             The allowances, subsidies, bonuses for affected people to move out of the project areas as
              scheduled;
             The cost for recruitment of domestic resettlement specialists and independent consultant;
             Contingency cost: The new Land Law, every January, the city People's Committee will
              issue the unit prices of land. Experiences shows that in most cases, land prices increase
              gradually each year.
      The detailed statistical analysis of impacts and cost estimates will be divided into categories and
      represented in the pages below.
      Thus, the total cost of compensation, assistance and resettlement of Da Nang Priority
      Infrastructure Investment Project is VND 71,300,000,000 (in words: Seventy-one billion and
      three hundred million dong only). This cost is expected to be disbursed in 02 years, starting from
      quarter 212010 and ending in quarter 4/2011.
      In the first year (2010) - the beginning of the project compensation and site clearance, the PMU
      needs VND 30,000,000,000 to serve the organization of compensation payment for affected
      households. In 2011, this cost will be disbursed about VND 41,300,000,000.

  The Da Nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project (PIIP) is being implemented in two
  stages that (i) Stage 1: preparation for the investment portion of the first phase began in
  January 2007 and was completed in June 2008; the construction work in Phase 1 began in
  May 2008 and is 'estimated to continue until June 2010 and Stage 2: the international
  c6nsultants, CDM, started preparations for Phase 2 in December 2009 and expected to
  complete on May 11,2011.

  + Project Objective
  The project aims to upgrade tertiary infrastructure for the low income area (LIAs) by
  providing resettlement housing and microcredit plans to improve housing for the people. The
, infrastructure investment will include flood control, new drainage systems, wastewater

  The project includes four components and two phases:
  Component A - Upgrading the Tertiary Infrastructures in Low Income Areas
  The participatory method similar to the one applied in the Vietnam Urban Upgrading Project
  will be applied in this component. The upgrade ensures low-income population in urban areas
  to access basic services. The tertiary infrastructure will include expanding and asphalting the

2.4.       Resettlement Arrangements
It is reported that, at present, there is no case of relocation in the above said project, except
for only the Xuan Hoa Urban Ecology Project which is currently implementing resettlement
arrangement.
The Da Nang City People's Committee issued Decision No. 78511QD dated, 24/0912008
promulgating the unit price of land allocated to resettle households under the Xuan Hoa
Urban Ecology project. The price for eligible resettlement land in the E - Residential South
Bridge area of Cam Le Bridge, Xuan Hoa Ward, Cam Le district, is defined below:

  i SIT       Land position 1 type of road                          Land price

  I                                                Main households         Auxiliary households

       1     MC 20,5 m (5-10, 5-5) m                   1.100.000                  1.430.000
       2     MC 16,5 m (4,5 -7, 5 - 4,5) m              900.000                   1.170.000
       3     MC 11,5 m (3-5,5-3) m                      800.000                   1.040.000

Through a survey of households in the resettlement area, the it is found that people in the
region expressed that the prices charged to the resettlement land are relatively consistent with
their financial capabilities. Households are expected to buy the land in the resettlement area.
2.5.       Complaints and Complaint Redress
It is found DP has no complaint about the unit price of residential land and houses. They only
have questions about the area and legal status of the land because most of the people in the
area had large areas of adjacent land but it has not been given prices for compensation. It is
proposed that the executing agency that carried out the compensation and site clearance
should quickly review and verify the land measurement and pricing, then provide them
compensation and assistance payments, for peace of their mind.
2.6.       Monitoring and Evaluation
Land acquisition, clearance and resettlement for the projects are also being implemented by
the project owners. They implement compensation and site clearance under the capital budget
or capital invested by the enterprise so they do not hire independent consultants for
monitoring; there is only internal monitoring.
2.7.       Commuuity Satisfaction
Through field surveys and interviews with households affected by the project, some issues of
concern were raised by the people:
           1. According to a survey of households in the project area, people generally
              supported the project implementation, construction and be willing to handover
              their cleared land to the contractors.
           2. For households with agricultural land taken, it is proved that the DPs are willing
              to hand over land for development projects, they anticipate that their children
              should be assisted to attend training courses for their living rehabilitation and that
              they could be able to ensure a stable source of income.

       3. The resettler (s) who have relocated in the city's resettlement site, especially those
          with residential land affected in Hoa Xuan ward agrees with the unit price for
          residential land at Southern Area of Cam Le Bridge (also located in Hoa Xuan
          ward, Cam Le district) that is relatively low compared to exchange rates on the
          market. For example, land plot located along side of the 5.5 meters (in width) road
          is about VND 800,000 per m2 for main household (who is eligible to relocate in
          resettlement site); and VND 1,040,000 per m2 for sub-household.
       4. The a gricultural land affected in peripheral areas of Da N ang city (Cam Le
          district) is relatively large. The people in the region still live mainly based on
          agricultural income. However, due to urbanization in recent years, they no longer
          maintain such agriCUlture based livelihoods, so the affected land does not affect
          their lives overally.

IV.    CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
4.1.   Conclusion.
Based on assessment of the project implementation of compensation, land acquisition and
resettlement, it is concluded that:
            There are some construction works/components under Da Nang Priority
            Infrastructure Investment Project which will be constructed overlapping with
            those of other involved projects implemented by Da nang PPC. The Da nang PIIP
            also required land which has been cleared by other projects where compensation
            payment has been completed. Thus, these project owners will hand over cleared
            land to Da nang Priority Infrastructure Investment Project.
            Other projects are infrastructure ones and they will bring benefit for community.
            Thus, before implementing, these projects carried out information disclosure
            widely and fully for project community. Thus, local people supported project
            actively. In general, local people were satisfied with project compensation and
            resettlement policies
            Other said projects might be carried out contemporaneously with the PUP but it is
            not directly and significantly related to the project and not to achieve its objectives
            as set forth in the project document.
4.2.   Recommendation
Based on shortcoming issues, it is proposed with following recommendation:
            Currently, due to lack of staff responsible for measurement, certification of city
            land, thus, cadastral map making and certification of land original have been
            implement slowly. This led to some delay in compensation and caused complaints
            from local people.

          It is necessary to enhance coordination between relevant PMUs to promote
          progress of site clearance for construction.
          Relevant PMUs should have meetings to update compensation and resettlement
          progress, based on updated data they will have to make solutions or propose
          recommendations to City PC to have timely polices for promoting progress of
          compensation and resettlement.
