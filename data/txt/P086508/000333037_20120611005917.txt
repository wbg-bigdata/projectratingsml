1. INTRODUCTION

1. 1 Project Background

With a population of 890.470 people, a natural area of 1.283,42 km2 (Statistical Yearbook in 2009) and
located in the central region of Vietnam, Da Nang is considered as an important gateway to the sea, to
the central highlands and countries such as Laos, Cambodia and Thailand.

The Socio-economic Development Plan (Phase 2006-2010) had set targeted annual GDP growth rate
of about 14-15%. This intense growth has an environmental cost; the old and degraded infrastructure
system affects public health, environmental quality, and economic development.

Under these circumstances, in 2004, the Government of Vietnam requested FDI support for the
development project Priority Infrastructure Investment Project in Da Nang. The project as described in
the investment report (IR/PFS) of the Da Nang People's Committee was adopted by Decision No.
2456/QD-UBND issued April 4, 2007. Thecredit agreement was signed between the World Bank and
the State Bank of Vietnam on 28/08/2008 and the project became effective on 26/11/2008.

Priority Infrastructure Investment Project-Da Nang, an active investment in infrastructure sector, has
contributed to completing City Development Plan (2006-2013) and Socio-economic Development
Strategy 2020.

1.2. Project Objectives

      Urban poverty alleviation through upgrading of technical infrastructure, environmental
       condition and improvement in living condition of the urban poor;
      Improvement of environmental condition in polluted areas relating to waste water, sewerage
       issues;
      Enhancement of economic growth through investment in development of strategic
       infrastructure, implementation of improvements and technical assistance to create an attractive
       investment climate;
      Gradual adaptation to urban development planning;
      Socialization in process of planning, programming and implementing investment in urban
       infrastructure upgrading through participatory technical solutions, human resources and fund
       contribution;
      Promotion in participatory project preparation, implementation and management in order to
       satisfactorily meet people’ demand;
      Provision of support to institution and enhancement in management capacity to City’s
       administration authorities.

       The project is divided into two phases: Phase 1: 2008 – 2010; Phase 2: 2009 – 2013. The EIA
       of phase 1 was completed in 2008 and the full EIA has been completed and approved and its
       executive summary (ES) was already submitted to the Board of the World Bank. The remaining
       investments of Phase 2, considered together to be equivalent to a Category A project, were
       considered in a separate EIA which has also been completed and approved by the Government
       of Vietnam and the World Bank (dislosed at the Infoshop on 01 August 2011). This ES
       summarizes that second EIA, covering the investments under Phase 2. In the remainder of this
       ES, “the Project? refers to Phase 2 of the PIIP project.

                                                                                                    4
1.3 Basis of law, legislation and regulation

3. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES

3.1 Component A: Urban upgrading

Component A is for upgrading roads/alleys, sewerage system, water supply, lighting and community
works such as childcares and meeting halls for the LIAs. The options were focused on upgrading
roads/alleys and the third sewerage system based on the participatory approach. The rests that were in
line with the master plan of communities or regulations of the city, were not considered.

Upgrading the road / alley has two options the width of roads/alleys (1) was kept as the status from 2-5
-3.5 m, (2) expanded to from 3.5 m - 4.5 m. As a result, the people chose the option 1 because the
expansion of road greater than 3.5m will only help fire trucks reach the fire incident, but the people
have chosen to build docks fighting in residential areas to fight fire when it occurs. Thus, the
expansion is not necessary. In addition, the expansion of roads will raise the costs of construction and
relocation compensation.

Upgrade the drainage system has three options (1) box culvert with concreted cover, (2) circular
reinforced concreted culvert, (3) box culvert built by brick and covered by reinforced concrete. The
community chose option 1 because box culvert in place and covered with concreted cover is firm and
                                                                                                   8
easier to be regularly maintained and more convenient for household connecting their wastewater pipes
into the city sewerage system.

3.2 Component B: Environmental Management

Component B consists of expanding the sewerage and drainage system, constructing new Hoa Xuan
WWTP and Lien Chieu WWTP and upgrading Son Tra WWTP, one of the existing WWTPs in the
city, as pilot. Regarding alternatives, expanding the sewerage and drainage system and the positions
for constructing Hoa Xuan WWTP and Lien Chieu WWTP were in line with the city wastewater
management strategy to 2040. The alternatives were only focused on analyzing the wastewater
treatment technology of the WWTPs. Three options identified were the second treatment technology,
odor control and disinfection.

The second treatment technology

Because of the narrow buffer zone based on QCVN 07/2010/BXD (40m), some treatment technologies
such as biological lagoons or disinfection by UV light are not considered. Sequencing Biological
Reactor (SBR) and Extended Aeration (EA) were two options identified for providing secondary
treatment at the Hoa Xuan and Lien Chieu WWTPs. The technology of extended aeration oxidation
ditch (Lass-EA) is evaluated more advantageously than the batching biological reaction technology
(SBR) in term of the wastewater treatment efficiency and environment pollution thank to its less smell
and sludge formation.

Odor control

Three methods are proposed deodorizers to control odor in option (i) by activated carbon absorption,
(ii) the biological filter and (iii) by chemical treatment. Based on the advantages and disadvantages of
each option, the biological filter method is proposed because of simple application, does not generate
by-products of environmental pollution and lower operating cost.

Disinfection

Three options to choose for the disinfection of treated wastewater before discharging into the water
body are using Cl2, NaClO, and UV. Chlorine gas is chosen due to broad spectrum antimicrobial, easy
to use, can reduce environmental pollution, low operating cost.

3.3 Component C: Roads and Bridges

The investment is to construct Nguyen Tri Phuong and the South Link Road with four bridges in the
alignment with the roads. This is in line with the city transportation master plan, therefore no options
were considered.

4. BASELINE CONDITIONS IN THE PROJECT AREA

4.1 Geography and Terrain

Da Nang City is located in the middle of the country, on the North - South Axis. It is 764km far from
Hanoi to the North, 964 km far from Ho Chi Minh City to the South, and 108km from Hue city to the

                                                                                                      9
Northwest. It borders Thua Thien – Hue to the North, Quang Nam to the West, and the China Sea to
the East.

Danang terrain includes the coastal plain and mountains. The hilly terrain covers a large area in the
North of city with height compared with sea water level of about 700 – 1500m. The coastal plain is
low, which is suitable for paddy field cultivation and often affected by flood in raining season.

Phase 2 of DN – PIIP consists of three components A, B and C, which is located in 6 inner districts of
the city: Hai Chau, Thanh Khe, Son Tra, Ngu Hanh Son, Lien Chieu, Cam Le with the urban area 1 of
241.51 km2 and one rural district - Hoa Vang. The project will be constructed within the plain area and
the city centre. (Annex 1).

4.2 River network and Sea

       ? River network

River network passing Da nang city is short and declined, and most of them originated from the west,
northwest and Quang Nam province. Meteorological system is the main source which provides the
fresh water to meet demands of Da Nang city. The Rivers of the City are: Tuy Loan River, Cu De
River (in the north), Yen River, Qua Giang River, La Tho River, Vinh Dien River and Han River. Tuy
Loan and Cu De have independent water basins and locate in Da Nang city. Other Rivers are all
downstream of Thu Bon and Vu Gia Rivers.

Vinh Dien River is the branch of Thu Bon River at Cau Lau Bridge, approximately 5km toward the
upstream. Vinh Dien River brings part of Thu Bon water and receives the flows of La Tho and Qua
Giang Rivers before discharging into Han River. The river will receive the treated wastewater
discharged from Hoa Xuan WWTP at Co Man village (called Tu Cau river) (N: 15059’17.4?; E:
108013’19.3?) with the smallest water flow of 67.37m3/s. The river has currently been used for water
way and flora and founa system is poor without any valuable and protected species.

Cu De basin is on the northern city and has plume shape, which tilts North East - South West. The total
area of the River basin is 472km2. Total length of Cu De River is 38km. The river will receive the
treated water discharged from Lien Chieu WWTP at the downstream (N: 1605’19?.9; E: 10807’4.7?)
with the smallest water flow of 20m3/s. The river has currently been used for water way and aquatic
system is poor without any valuable and protected species.

       ? Sea

Da nang city is considered as a coastal city with nearly 70km sea shores traversing from the foot of Hai
Van pass to Non Nuoc area with a range of beaches that are potential for tourists.

4.3 Social and environmental conditions

Although the socio - economic development is significant, Da nang city is experiencing problems in
the deterioration of infrastructure such as roads and waste water collection and drainage system, which

                                                                                                     10
has resulted in local flooding in low areas, blocked waste water discharging into the receiving body. As
a result, the environment within the city has become worse recently.

The percentage of households connected to the city drainage system is still low, at about 20%. Most of
the untreated water is discharged into the river or into the ground, causing surface and groundwater
pollution.

The surface water quality in most of the rivers has signs of pollution with organics and coliforms but
the concentrations are still within the allowable standard in accordance with QCVN 08:2008. The
ground water in the Low Income Areas (LIAs) is heavily contaminated with organics and coliforms,
the concentrations of BOD5, coliforms exceed the standard regulated by QCVN 09: 2008.

The seawater at several places especially at the river month has signs of organic pollution. This will
probably affect the potential of tourism of the city, which may influence the sustainably economic
development of the city in the future.

5. IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND IDENTIFICATION OF MITIGATION MEASURES

Impact assessments and mitigation measures for each component investment were developed based on
document reviews, meetings with key agencies, field visits to project sites and collection of
environmental baseline data (air, noise, vibration, sediment, sludge analysis, etc). A checklist method
was used to identify key issues and the required mitigation measures, based on knowledge and
experience in the country and taking into account good international practices. In addition to the EIA
reports, a Social Impact Assessment (SIA), Resettlement Action Plans (RPs) have also been prepared
in line with relevant WB’s safeguard policies. These have all been taken into account in EIA
preparation and all documents have been disclosed to the public and are available for consultation in
the Bank’s infoShop as well as nationally.

5.1 Overview of the Project Impacts

5.1.1 Potential positive impact

The project investment will improve the environmental and social conditions in Da Nang city in
general and for the people living in the project area in particular. The project is to upgrade
infrastructure, social and environmental sanitation for low-income areas such as roads, electricity,
water and waste collection, social services such as childcare and community meeting halls. The project
also improves the collection and wastewater treatment, storm water drainage to overcome flooding and
environmental pollution in the project area. Nguyen Tri Phuong road and The Southern Ring Road of
the city completed will create social- economic development opportunities for the city. Residents of
suburbs have access to urban infrastructure such as education, health and income opportunities to
improve thanks to trade with the outside. The population density in the center may reduced due to the
people are probably to move to downtown to seek opportunities in the new urban areas.

5.1.2 Potential negative impact

Besides the above-mentioned positive effects, the potentially negative impacts have been evaluated in
the full EIA report. Below is the summary of typical impacts:

      Land Acquisition and Resettlement
                                                                                                     11
          Dismantling buildings, fences in preparation for construction
          Potential impacts during the construction such as dust, wastewater, runoff water, solid wastes
           and other impacts such as noise, vibration, damage of public and private works
          Potential impacts during operation phase such as odors, sediment and sludge treatment,
           chlorine gas.
          Physical Cultural Resources such as temples in construction area, relocation of graves
          The cumulative effects such as plant waste water treatment area of Lien Chieu and Hoa Khanh
           Industrial Zone wastewater.

5.2 Potentially negative impacts and proposed mitigation measures

5.2.1 Impacts during the Land acquisition and resettlement phase

The need to minimize to the extent possible land acquisition and resettlement was a factor taken into
account during the feasibility study for three components. The summary of number of affected
households and land acquisition is reflected in Table 5-1.

Mitigation measures: Two detailed Resettlement Action Plan (RAPs) have been prepared for the
project’s phase 2A and 2B and were approved by both Government of Vietnam and the World Bank.

5.2.2 Impacts during the Land clearance and constructions

Key impacts will include: (a) relocation of existing infrastructure (water supply, electricity, etc.), (b)
site clearance such as demolishing roads, fences and earthworks construction, (c) increased traffic
during construction, wastewater from construction sites, worker recreation, runoff water from freshly
excavated areas, and disposal of solid waste materials, including material from canal dredging, some of
which may be contaminated with organic and odorous pollutants.

During the detailed design of the project works, attention will be given to mitigating these impacts to
the extent possible by incorporating into the designs, bidding documentation, and resulting contracts.
Specifically, the bidding documents and the contracts will reflect (i) the provisions of the
comprehensive Environmental Codes of Practice (ECOPs) for small-scale urban construction works
that have been prepared for the project (see Table 5.2 below); and (ii) site specific impact and
mitigation measures that have been prepared for each of the project works where impacts and
mitigation measures are beyond, or in addition to the provisions of the ECOPs. Full details on the
ECOPs and the site-specific measures are included in the EIAs.

Categories of Impacts Covered by the ECOPs are as follows:

      Dust generation
      Air pollution
      Impacts from noise and vibration
      Water pollution
      Drainage and sedimentation control
      Management of stockpiles, quarries, and borrow pits
      Solid waste
      Management of dredged materials
      Traffic management
      Interruption of utility services
      Restoration of affected areas
      Worker and public safety
      Chance findings


5.2.3 Impacts during operation

In the operation phase, the most concern negative impacts on workers and local people living in the
surrounding area are (i) odors, and (ii) sludge and chlorine gas.

Mitigation measures: Odors arising from water treatment facilities and sludge will be collected and
treated by biological methods to ensure 99% H2S removed. Also, green trees will be planted around the
landscape to reduce odors in the surrounding environment. Sludge will be dried and agglomerated then
buried in Khanh Son landfill. Chlorine gas will be used for disinfection the effluent automatically in

5.2.4 Potential impacts on Physical and Cultural Resources

There are 1027 graves that need to be relocated, of which 850 graves in phase 2A and 177 graves in
phase 2B. The activity results in the WB’s policy on Physical and Cultural Resources (OP 4.11) being
triggered. None of the other cultural resources in the project area will be affected by the project
because they are away from the construction area by at least 300-400 m.

Mitigation measures: Impacts on identified cultural resources, associated mitigation measures and
environmental monitoring are addressed in EIAs. Mitigation measures to relocate graves are identified
through community consultation, relatives and local authorities. The mitigation measures include
relocation, relocation time and funding support for the entire relocation were determined, the relatives
of graves are responsible for conducting the relocation under monitoring from the local authority and
PMU.

The EMPs include clear guidance for project activities on identified PCR locations, and also chance
finds procedures to be followed, in line with Government regulations and consistent with World Bank
policy. The chance find procedures are illustrated in Figure 5.1.

5.2.5 Cumulative impacts

The EIA identified that Cu De river in which Lien Chieu WWTP will discharge its treated wastewater
is the same as that into which Hoa Khanh Industrial Zone also discharges its effluents. As long as both
point sources respect national standards for effluent discharges, the EIA has shown that the receiving
waters can absorb the discharges without any significant impact on river water quality. Thus there is a
cumulative impact resulting from operations of the two WWTPs, Lien Chieu WWTP and Hoa Khanh
industrial Zone WWTP, but it is not considered significant. However, the responsible agency, Da Nang
DONRE, must carefully carry out its responsibility of periodic inspection and assessment of
wastewater quality outputs of both Lien Chieu and Hoa Khanh WWPT. The PIIP project includes
capacity building and assistance to the Recipient to ensure this monitoring takes place.

6. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN

Based on the assessment of the potential negative impacts discussed and the mitigation measures
outlined in Item 5, this part presents a summary of the Environmental Management Plans (EMPs). The
EMPs identify actions to be carried out under each responsible agencies in the city including the
environmental monitoring program and the implementation arrangements. These take into account the
need to comply with the Government’s EIA regulations and the World Bank’s safeguard policies.

6.1 Basic principles

As a part of the EIA, an Environmental Management Plan (EMP) is a safeguards instrument that
consists of information on and guidance for the process of mitigating and managing adverse
environmental impacts throughout project implementation. Typically, in Vietnam, an EMP comprises a
list of mitigation measures to be carried out by contractors, an environmental monitoring program,
organizational arrangements, and an estimated monitoring cost.

There is a comprehensive regulatory framework in Vietnam related to EIA preparation, environmental
standards, protection and management of forest and cultural property, and other aspects related to
construction and operation of facilities and infrastructures. The project EMP’s are consistent with
these regulations.

To facilitate effective implementation of the EMPs, PIIP- PMU will: (a) establish an Environment and
Social Unit (ESU) responsible for ensuring timely implementation of the EMP, including monitoring,
reporting, and capacity building related to safeguards; (b) assign the Construction Supervision
Consultant (CSC) to be responsible for supervision of the contractor’s safeguard performance as part
of the construction contract and this requirement will be included in the CSC terms of reference
(TOR); and (c) hire qualified national consultants as the Environmental Management Consultant
(EMC) to assist the ESU in performing these tasks.

The city water supply, drainage, urban environmental management companies and transportation
agencies as appropriate, will be responsible for implementing the mitigation measures during the
operation stage of the project and they will ensure that the mitigation measures are implemented and
adequate budget is provided. The City Steering Committee (CSC) chaired by the Chairman or Vice
Chairman of the City People’s Committee (CCP) will provide the overall policy guidance and
oversight of project implementation.

In terms of laying out the mitigation measures of the EMP, there are two fundamental parts. Firstly, the
project has developed and will use Environmental Codes of Practice (ECOPs). These ECOPs, which
are presented in the EIA, outline typical general low-level impacts that can be expected to occur in a
wide range of construction activities of the project. These include mitigation measures for these
impacts and a process for including them in the project’s construction contracts. Secondly, all site-
specific impacts that are either not covered in the general ECOPs or which are of an order of
magnitude that require mitigation measures not covered in the ECOPs, are described in more detail in
the EMP.

Impacts due to, and mitigation measures for, land acquisition and resettlement are presented separately
in the respective subproject RPs and they will be implemented and monitored separately.

6.2 Management Organization and Responsibilities
                                                                                                     15
Environment management responsibilities have been defined in the EIA and the related EMPs.
Environmental management during construction involves the PIIP- PMU, CMC, contractors, and the
Independent Environmental Monitoring Consultants (IEMCs), Community, Local Authorities such as
DONRE, and NGOs . Details of these responsibilities are provided in the EIAs.

6.3 Environmental Monitoring

It is essential to design the monitoring program and monitoring frequency appropriately to be able to
record both the overall performance of the project works as well as the short-term impact due to
construction activities. The environmental monitoring program will be implemented during the pre-
construction, construction and operation phases. Environmental monitoring plan should include two main
activities of (a) monitoring of mitigation measures and (b) monitoring of environmental quality at 3 levels:

      Monitoring the level of compliance with mitigation measures,
      Community-based monitoring, and
      Monitoring the environmental parameters set out in the EIAs.

6.4 Environmental Supervision

Environmental supervision during construction will be the responsibility of the PMU and its
contractors assisted as needed by DONRE and community representatives in accordance with national
environmental law and other legal regulations such as Decision 80/2005/QD-TTg dated April 18,
2005.

6.5 Independent Environmental Monitoring Consultant (IEMC)

The IEMCs will be recruited by the PMU and responsible for carrying out environmental sampling and
monitoring at least twice a year, on all environmental-related issues regarding the works. Based on
their regularly field visits and the collection of secondary data from CMC, constructors and PMU, they
will check, review, verify and validate the overall environmental performance of the project and the
relevant mitigation measures and monitoring programs provided in the EMP are being fully complied
with. The IEMCs will also supply specialized assistance to the PMUs and, if required, to the CSCs, on
environmental matters.

6.6 Costs of Environmental Management Plan

The EMP cost will comprise: (a) cost for implementation of the mitigation measures by contractor, (b)
cost for supervision by the CSC, (c) cost for the independent environmental monitoring consultant
(IEMC), (d) monitoring of environmental quality, and (e) PMU safeguard management costs. Costs for
the implementation of the mitigation measures during construction will be part of the contract costs
while the costs for monitoring by the CSC is provided for in the construction supervision contracts.
Costs for PMU operations related to the EMP are provided for in the project management budget of the
PMU. None of these costs can be easily calculated separately.

7. PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND INFORMATION DISCLOSURE

7.1. Public consultation during preparation of the EIAs

Community consultation is a key component in EIA process which is required by World Bank
safeguard policies and Vietnam decree No. 80/2006/ND-CP. Two rounds of community consultation
were carried out by EIA consultant.

First round

The objective of first round consultation was to: (i) collect opinions/feedback from affected people and
local authorities on environmental impacts as well as effective mitigation measures to complete
EIA/EMP report; and (ii) have initial agreement in cooperation to local authorities during project
implementation process.

The first round of public consultation was described as follows:

Summary of results

         The PMU must apply the mitigation measures stated in the report to minimize the identified
          negative impacts on the environment and society.
         The investors must have a specific plan to arrange an appropriate resettlement plan for totally
          affected households. The compensation and clearance must be carried out quickly based on the
          policies of the Government and WB.
         During construction time, constructors must have a reasonable plan to avoid damaging the
          public works especially power and water supplies, to minimize the negative impacts on the
          local people such as dust, noise, traffic safety and social security in the project area to an
          acceptable level.
         Constructors must follow strictly the regulations on safety transportation to avoid accidents.
         For operation of the WWTP, the mitigation measures stated in the report must be strictly
          applied to reduce odor to an acceptable level, to protect the surface water in the Vinh Dien and
          Cu De rivers.
         Periodic check of the quality of input and output wastewater in the WWTP must be strictly
          carried out to ensure the WWTPs are always in a good operation.
         The investor must work closely with the relevant agencies in the city to implement the project
          as the schedule, in good quality and comply with the mitigation measures to minimize the
          negative impacts in three phases: Pre-construction, construction and operation of the project
          and put the project in effect as scheduled.

8. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION

Implementing the project is necessary because the project completion will contribute largely to
improved sanitation conditions through: (1) develop a number of services (water supply, water supply
for fire fighting, wastewater and solid waste collection) for 09 LIAs (2) build and develop a collection
                                                                                                       18
system and wastewater treatment, (3) development of transportation systems (bridges and roads) in the
south of city that contributes to develop infrastructure, urban landscape in order to meet overall
development needs of the city.

However, it would not avoid the negative impacts during the phases of pre- construction, construction
and operation of projects.

During pre-construction phases, some negative impacts will affect the local environment and local
populations in the project areas. Land acquisition and resettlement of project affected households as
well as relocation of a substantial number of graves will be required. Detailed Resettlement Plans and
relocation of graves were prepared as part of project preparation.

During the construction phase, there will be negative impacts, including vehicle and equipment
exhaust emissions, smoke, dust and noise from construction equipment; road and sewage system
construction, rain water and sewage sewer installation, wastewater from construction workers and
construction activities, construction solid waste, dredged sludge and some contaminated waste, among
others. These have been identified in the EIA studies. These impacts can be mitigated by ensuring that
the project contractors comply with the provisions of their contracts, including those which relate to
environmental impacts. The PMUs and their CSCs will be responsible for ensuring that this
compliance occurs. In accordance with their contracts, contractors will be required to prepare site-
specific detailed design documents, including environmental provisions. The site-specific EMPs will
be approved by the project owner prior to the work commencing. Periodic monitoring reports will be
prepared by independent consultants and the results will be submitted to the World Bank and the
Government.

To facilitate effective mitigation of impacts during operation, the project will also provide support to
ensure that local regulations and operation manuals related to operation of the project facilities will be
put in place.

The PMU is committed to the compliance with the mitigation measures in three phases of the project
and comply with the policies of the World Bank and the Government in the EIA report.
