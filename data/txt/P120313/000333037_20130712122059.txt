F. Results Framework Analysis


Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)

The Climate Change DPL supported the Government of Indonesia’s (GOI) efforts to develop a
lower carbon, more climate-resilient growth path. It also intended to help Indonesia prepare for
the post-2012 global climate change regime by establishing a conducive policy, regulatory and
institutional setting to allow Indonesia to access global climate finance opportunities and carbon
markets.

The CCDPL focused on three main thematic areas: climate change mitigation; adaptation; and
cross-sectoral issues. On mitigation, key targets for reductions were forest loss and peat land
conversion and burning, reducing the over use of fossil fuels, developing renewable energy
alternatives (e.g., geothermal and biomass) and promoting energy efficiency. On adaptation, the
key priorities were in agriculture, water management, coastal and marine resource management,
as well as disaster preparedness and resiliency. Institutional and cross-sectoral issues included
better analysis, policy coordination, and the integration of climate change priorities into the
national development planning and budgeting system.

              CLIMATE CHANGE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
           IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT


1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1. Context at Appraisal

1.1.1. Economic Context

In 2010, the outlook for Indonesia’s economy was that momentum would continue to
build, with growth rising above 6 percent in 2011 and with scope for growth to average
7 percent by mid-decade, despite the weaker global economic outlook. The projected
growth rates above 6 percent and the projection of mild inflation rates to rise only slightly
over the coming years, suggested ongoing progress in poverty reduction. In the period 2010-
14, the budget was expected to increase by more than 30 percent in real terms compared to
2005-2009 period (about US$500 billion in 2008 prices) creating significant opportunities to
improve public services. In order to seize these opportunities, the Bank recommended that
Indonesia needed more effective and accountable institutions that could translate available
resources into better development outcomes. The Bank considered these actions as
particularly important as Indonesia embarked on a period of second-generation reforms to
provide, for example, more sophisticated services in infrastructure, better education, and a
sustainable health system. These projections of rising growth rates and improving social
outcomes were considered by the Bank to be contingent on the government aggressively
progressing in this agenda, with political developments at the time creating the risk that
reforms would be slower and shallower than may have been expected in late 2009.

1.1.2. Political Context

The Government, re-elected in 2009, recognized the need to face the challenge of
realizing its potential as a competitive, inclusive, sustainable and resilient middle-
income country by adapting the institutions and mechanisms that govern the functioning of
the state and shape state-society interactions. To go beyond strong economic performance
and consolidation of the political system, the Bank concluded that Indonesia needed to
accelerate growth and job creation while ensuring that it is inclusive and sustainable.
Indonesia also needed to capitalize on the potential of its young population and rapidly
growing labor force, improve the investment climate (mainly by improving quality of
infrastructure and reducing regulatory/legal uncertainty), stimulate creation of higher value-
added non-agricultural jobs and increase agricultural productivity. Inadequate environmental
management was also seen as a challenge to sustainable development, providing some of the
rationale for developing a climate change focus in the Bank’s engagement with the
Government of Indonesia (GOI) on development policy operations. The GOI developed
National Priority Action Plan for 2010, which laid the base for the Medium Term
Development Plan (RPJM) 2010-2014). The GOI’s 11 sectoral priorities included energy
issues, environmental and climate change, and disaster preparedness.

The CCDPL operation was planned and implemented in the aftermath of the global
financial crisis of 2008-9 – from which Indonesia emerged relatively unscathed, thanks
in large part to growth driven by strong domestic consumption and key commodity
exports. At the time there was still some uncertainty about the state of the economy and the
potential for repercussions from the down turn affecting trading partners and investors. Thus,
                                              1
there was considerable interest to put in place financing mechanisms to ensure budget
support, but no additional incentives to establish more robust coordination mechanisms or
cross-sectoral policy reforms that cut across multiple sectors and issues.

1.1.3. Strategic Context

The CCDPL was strategic because climate change remains an economic development
challenge facing Indonesia, in terms of threats to food and water security, agricultural
productivity, rural and coastal livelihoods, disease processes and production of essential
environmental services. At the same time, Indonesia’s green house gas (GHG) emissions are
globally significant, with two thirds coming from land use change and forestry (LUCF) and
peat fires. Although fossil fuel related emissions per capita are relatively low. Energy use is
growing rapidly and becoming more emissions intensive because of the increasing reliance
on coal-fired power and rising use of motorized transport. Policy interventions under this
operation were also strategic because of the opportunity to increase economic efficiency and
competitiveness in the forest, land use and energy sectors.

The CC DPL supported the GOI’s policy agenda on climate change, an issue of growing
global concern. The CCDPL focused on three core strategic areas: (i) addressing the need to
mitigate Indonesia’s greenhouse gas emissions; (ii) enhancing adaptation and resiliency
efforts in key sectors; and (iii) strengthening the institutions and cross-cutting policy
framework needed for a successful climate change response. It was also seen as an
opportunity to harmonize support with several development partners and create a platform for
continuing dialogue and reform, and to build on the Bank’s significant history of DPL
support in the areas of economic and infrastructure policy reform.

The CCDPL was fully consistent with the WBG Country Partnership Strategy for
Indonesia (2009-2012), which was oriented towards strengthening Indonesian
institutions in order to face development challenges. Consistent with the CPS, specifically
Core engagement 5 “Environmental Sustainability and Disaster Mitigation?, the CCDPL
focused on strengthening institutions and building effective country systems. Other ongoing
operations at the time included several Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects, and
the Forest Investment Program (FIP). In terms of collaboration with key partners’ programs,
the CCDPL was jointly deployed with and provided parallel financing for the “Climate
Change Policy Loan? (CC-PL) series, jointly financed by JICA and AFD.

1.2. Original Program Development Objective and Key Indicators

The CCDPL aimed to GOI efforts to develop a lower carbon, more climate-resilient growth
path. It was also intended to help Indonesia prepare for a post-2012 global climate change
regime by establishing a favorable policy and institutional setting to access global climate
finance opportunities and carbon markets. The CCDPL was designed for the Government to
use program/policy lending to support the President's ambitious climate change agenda.
Specifically, the CCDPL supported the following policy areas in Table 1.

1.3. Revised Program Development Objectives

The PDO remained consistent and unchanged throughout the series.

1.4. Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

Policy Area 1: Mitigation: Land Use Change and Forestry (LUCF) Sector. The CCDPL
focused on actions critical to address governance issues and upstream drivers of deforestation
and loss. The operation recognized GOI efforts to develop strategies and identify financing
sources for addressing LUCF emissions sources, in collaboration with development partners.
CCDPL policy actions were aimed at: peatlands, REDD piloting efforts, and forest
governance improvements. Expected benefits included: policy harmonization and enabling
conditions for integrated action to reduce peat degradation and fires and improved forest and

                                              3
land management practices. In addition, improved policy setting plus implementation actions
were expected to reduce emissions and allow the GOI to access forest financing mechanisms
in the post-2012 climate regime. The CCDPL recognized Indonesia’s achievements in this
policy area and all others below with the prior actions listed in Table 2.

Mitigation: Energy Sector. The CCDPL focused on policy actions essential to addressing
emissions reduction priorities, including renewable energy, energy efficiency, and cost
reflective energy pricing. Due to large potential capacity, geothermal is one of the best
options to diversify Indonesia’s energy mix. However, the regulatory framework created
barriers and uncertainties for project developers. To accelerate geothermal power
development, three key policies were targeted: (1) mandatory power purchase (off-take) by
PLN; (2) mandatory market policy of a fixed tariff (feed-in tariff) or a fixed quantity
(renewable energy portfolio standards); and (3) a compensation mechanism to allow the
incremental cost of geothermal power purchase to pass-through to consumers or compensate
PLN through government payment. Expected benefits included increased economic benefits
from energy efficiency; increased energy security from investments in renewable domestic
energy sources; and economic and social benefits of reduced emissions.

Policy Area 2: Adaptation and Disaster Preparedness. The CCDPL focused on actions in
the key areas of Indonesia’s vulnerability and adaptation needs, including water resources,
agricultural resilience, coastal threats and livelihoods, and disaster preparedness. Indonesia
recognized adaptation as a key priority area to protect the poor, who will likely experience
the greatest impacts, yet have the least resources and capacity to respond. CCDPL policy
areas included planning and institutional development at the regional level in the water
resources sector and disaster risk reduction area, extension and capacity development at the
community level in the agriculture, and strategic planning and community development in the
coastal and marine sector. Expected benefits in this policy area included: improved capacity
and resilience at institutional level and community level in key sectors, as well as integration
of adaptation needs into disaster preparedness plans and institutions.

Policy Area 3: Cross Sectoral and Institutional Issues. An integrated national response to
climate change requires cross-sectoral planning and coordination and appropriate institutional
structures for formulating and carrying out policies and programs. BAPPENAS, Ministry of
Finance, the National Council on Climate Change and the Ministry of Environment each play
an important role in coordination, policy making, planning and budget formulation, while
sectoral ministries retain responsibilities over key areas of the economy responsible for the
bulk of Indonesia’s emissions. Key actions targeted by the CCDPL include: developing a
firmer scientific understanding and institutional framework for coordination and action;
mainstreaming climate change issues into the national development planning and budgeting
process; and developing institutions, plans and information systems to allow Indonesia to
benefit from global climate finance mechanisms.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1. Program Performance

Table 2 provides a list of ‘prior actions’ achieved by the Government as the basis for
approving the first CCDPL. As climate change policy and financing touches on many aspects
of economic management, the matrix of policy actions covered a wide array of commitments.
The Bank and partners showed considerable flexibility in recognition of the GOI’s ownership
of program objectives and the need to engage across a range of ministries and agencies.


As expected for a program covering 11 separate policy areas, some parts of the program
performed better than expected while others fell short. In a number of key areas (climate
finance, REDD+, water resources management, disaster preparedness) progress was
significant, with outcomes exceeding expectations. In other areas (peatlands, energy
efficiency, and coastal adaptation) progress was considered less significant or transformative.
Those areas with less than desired achievements were hindered in part by complex regulatory
environments, and uncertainty in prioritizing investments.

2.2. Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Adequacy of Government commitment

The CCDPL was conceived as a series of operations supporting the GOI’s program for
climate change response and reform. The Bank’s operation came in the third year of the
GOI’s engagement in this effort, following on two prior annual policy operations supported
by JICA and AFD. However, as the Bank’s first operation was approved in May 2010,
important changes were announced in the senior management of the Ministry of Finance,
resulting in some uncertainty in the appetite for development policy operations.
Responsibilities of key personnel also changed at BAPPENAS, the agency most involved in
managing the CCDPL process with affected ministries. This resulted in a shift in continuity
of policy dialogue with key officials, if not the overall level of commitment to the aims of the
CCDPL. These changes also reduced the level of coordination and communication between
these two key agencies. By early 2011, uncertainties were also expressed about the GOI’s
need for continuing budget support through the series of climate operations.

The Bank discussed the CC program/policy loan concept with GOI and partners as early as
2007, during the UNFCCC COP 13 meeting in Bali. In 2008, the Bank determined to wait
for a more conducive governance / coordination framework to emerge (The National Council
on Climate Change was formed only in July 2008 and was months away from becoming
operational) with a more integrated policy reform program. This had an impact on the
program because the matrix of policy actions and the coordination/oversight system of the
process had already been established for two years before the Bank became actively involved.
The Bank team strived to streamline and prioritize the existing policy agenda, but there was
less effort on considering the political dynamics and possible pitfalls on certain issue areas.
Also, by coming in late relative to JICA and AFD, the Bank was mainly in the position to buy
into the existing process, providing another layer of international financing support.

Overall, Goverment commitment to the CCDPL was strong, since over the course of CCDPL
implementation, there was strong ownership and interest among the central planning and
financial management agencies in using climate change and the President’s commitments as a
driver for important reforms in key sectors, including land use and energy. There was also
good capacity at operational levels to carry initiatives through to implementation. The Bank
entered the operation in its third year based on its assessment of the availability of a
meaningful entry point into forestry and energy sector issues, as well as policy progress on
the national coordinating mechanism; in this case led by BAPPENAS and the Ministry of
Finance. Based on these considerations, the timing of entry for the CCDPL operation is
judged as appropriate.

Soundness of background analysis including lessons learned

The CCDPL was borne out of a strong framework of technical analysis, strategic documents,
and action plans, as a result of the GOI’s efforts on SNC, Strategy Response, and submissions
to the UNFCCC. These provided a strong rationale for specific actions and a unified sense of
what needed to be done across a range of sectors, particularly on mitigation. It is important to
note that a leading technical rationale for the chosen policy actions was emissions mitigation
potential. While important, this one focus might ignore other important factors in a decision,
                                               6
such as the distribution of benefits or the impact on the poor. Where climate objectives were
perceived to impose some opportunity cost or interference with achieving other important
objectives of an institution, less progress was made. For example, the belief that economic
growth would suffer was a common argument for resisting action to reduce emissions or
further regulate forestry and land use change.
Assessment of design

There was good coordination and strong levels of technical assistance between Government
and development partners, which was an important part of the CCDPL program, particularly
in areas where analysis of data, options and scenarios could inform agencies’ policy choices.
For this reason, the Bank was keen to cooperate and coordinate with JICA and AFD and
strengthen our partnership of support behind the Government’s climate agenda. Development
partners provided consultants, analysis, and monitoring support on renewable energy issues,
forestry issues, and on particular industry engagements (e.g., cement).

Through the CCDPL’s steering and technical committees, there was a good framework for
coordination across agencies in terms of establishing policy actions and monitoring
achievements. Process meetings were managed by BAPPENAS with wide representation
from involved agencies. Beyond coordinating the process, there were challenges in
coordinating the GOI’s policy response on some key issues, such as peat land management or
upstream incentives in the energy sector. Resolving these kinds of issues involved a
combination of technical and financial decisions and required bringing in parts of agencies
not originally represented in the CCDPL steering process. This was a good and logical step
in terms of resolving issues, but resulted in some delays on some critical issues.

Relevance of risks and effectiveness of mitigation measures.

The risks identified in the CCDPL’s original project design document were appropriate and
realistic. The task team benefited from strong client and partner relationships with country
clients and also across sectors and units within the Bank. This enabled the identification of
key issues, engagement with the key agencies and officials, and sustained dialogue and
coordination with Government and development partners. The key risks identified in the
project design document and the assessments of mitigation measures are included below:

•   Viability of GOI's climate change national action plans. The mitigation measure was
    to improve capacity via TA and AAA to assist the GOI to develop priorities and workable
    plans with appropriate resource allocations. Much of this work continues into the World
    Bank’s current engagement with the GOI, via projects identified in section 2.4 below.

•   Effectiveness of GOI counterpart. The mitigation measure was for the DPL operation
    to contribute to efforts to harmonize development partner support and focus analysis and
    policy advice within the steering committee and monitoring mechanism. This mitigation
    measure was judged as effective, particularly in the World Bank’s cooperation and
    coordination with the AFD and JICA to monitor progress across the CCPL and CCDPL.

•   GOI commitment to a progressive series of policy reform over medium term. There
    was no mitigation measure for this identified risk, though as climate policy and
    implementation have progressed, GOI commitment to policy reforms in key areas –
    particularly renewable energy and forest governance – remains strong.

•   Operation size and visibility. The identified risk was that the CCDPL should choose
    appropriate triggers of sufficient importance in order to justify the lending volume. This
                                              7
    was an appropriate statement, and justifies the Bank’s prudence in narrowing down the
    CCPL’s policy matrix to 11 policy areas.

•   Fiduciary and reputational risks. This identified risk is consistent across all Bank
    programs in Indonesia and the rationale that the CCDPL – and all other Bank
    engagements, with the required FM and procurement procedures – could contribute
    towards a strengthened overall fiduciary environment is appropriate.

•   Forest management as a long term challenge with possibly slow progress. The
    identified mitigation measure was to engage via a range of instruments to help the GOI to
    develop a sound REDD+ program to address governance and forest loss. The Bank is
    engaging in REDD+ in the 2013-2015 CPS and progress is considered positive, though
    slow.

•   Energy pricing is a long term challenge and there is a risk that progress will be
    intermittent. The Bank rightly judged this as a ‘highly charged political issue’ and the
    mitigation measures – advocating reforms to improve the investment climate for
    alternative energy investments and incentives for greater energy efficiency – were
    suitable within the scope of the CCDPL.

2.3. Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

The CCDPL monitoring and evaluation framework was designed to provide feedback and
adjust approaches on the overall climate policy reform agenda. The technical meetings and
sectoral engagements produced a rich understanding of the issues and challenges in a range of
high priority areas, as well as some understanding of the pros and cons of different
approaches and the reactions to the approaches at different levels in critical ministries. The
matrix of actions was focused through dialogue to a fairly tight set of issues and performance
indicators, at least for such a complex and cross-cutting agenda. However, the breadth of
coverage did present some challenges for tracking and monitoring performance. A more
focused and effective monitoring system, developed, owned and implemented by the
Government, may have been better able to monitor policy outcomes and performance
indicators. Such a system could be housed in the Deputy for Development Performance
Evaluation (www.BAPPENAS.go.id) in BAPPENAS, for example.

The M & E framework was implemented via three mechanisms. First, at the official level,
the GOI established a Steering Committee and a Technical Committee, responsible for
ensuring progress and follow up on agreed policy actions. Second, the GOI counterparts and
Development Partners held regular meetings and continuous dialogue to assess progress and
bottlenecks. This was facilitated by having the teams (from all development partners) based
in the field, with external technical support missions as needed. Locally available team
members were able to bring in sectoral knowledge, results from analysis, and networks based
on other operations to deepen the CCDPL policy dialogue around complex issues. Third, the
monitoring effort had a dedicated technical team from a consultancy (financed by JICA) and
a forestry expert (financed by AFD) to gather detailed evidence and documentation of
achievements and progress. This was especially useful in the production of monitoring
documents to track progress in key policy areas.

The CCDPL monitoring was used mainly in response to reporting needs related to the
program loan, though the information could also have been used to assess where and how
policies were being implemented properly with good results and where more intervention
might be needed. In addition, the results framework indicators could have been more closely
                                              8
linked to policy triggers and more achievable in the time frame of the operation. For example,
many actions might contribute indirectly and over the long term to the GOI’s commitment to
reduce GHG emissions by 26% by 2020 against business-as-usual projections, but these
results might not be seen in 2012 or even 2015.


2.4. Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operations

The GOI continues to prioritize climate change action, well beyond the policies and triggers
originally included in the CCDPL. Indonesia embraces REDD+ as a means of mitigating
emissions and creating incentives for more sustainable forest management and governance
reforms. Reforms in the energy sector have resulted in feed-in tariffs, upstream geothermal
proving efforts, and plans for subsidy reform that follow on the priorities and programs
outlined in the CCDPL.

The Bank continues engagement in key areas to advise central agencies on upstream policies
and strategies that affect environment and climate outcomes. The current CPS (2013-2015)
prioritizes sustainable development and disaster resilience as a key engagement area. The
Bank’s environment and climate work program focuses on challenges identified as priorities
in the CC DPL, such as strengthening national forest governance and monitoring systems.
The Ministry of Finance and BAPPENAS, for example, are now interested in creating a
“Green Development Support Facility to provide advice and technical assistance on key
sustainability issues, with the aim to influence the next RPJM. However, Indonesia’s
institutional structures and coordination mechanisms for integrating work across a range of
sectors remain weak, and thus pose challenges for unified climate intervention from the top.

Regarding the GOI’s ultimate decision to drop the CCDPL series, this was a political
decision, but perhaps could have been addressed with better communication and constituency
building. As it became clear that certain factions resisted the notion of borrowing for climate
change, the Bank and development partners prepared fact sheets and briefs to explain the
concept of a “development policy loan? (as a strategic tool for convening and progressing
priority policies at a high level, in a country with a declining debt burden), to a more general
audience. These points may not have been communicated sufficiently at a high level, partly
because the appetite for this form of dialogue was not evident and partly because the partners
did not want to be seen as “marketing? loans.

The monitoring of the 2011 matrix was continued beyond the CCDPL and a final steering
committee meeting was organized by the Government on November 2012.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1.   Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The CCDPL recognized and supported GOI commitments, built on the climate policy and
financing dialogue between the Government and its development partners and enhanced
Indonesia’s efforts to access other forms of climate finance. It also built on the GOI’s strong
program and road map for climate change action, as embodied in key planning and budgeting
documents. In that regard the PDO and policy areas continue to be highly relevant to GOI
policy as well as the World Bank’s CPS (2013-2015). The actions initiated under the DPL are
consistent with the follow-up operations discussed above in section 2.4, notably support to

                                               9
the REDD+ agenda, incentives for sustainable forest management and governance reforms,
and support to the emerging green development agenda.

The CCDPL included objectives that were extremely relevant to addressing Indonesia’s
climate challenges and built on priorities and programs that the GOI itself had set in motion.
These objectives and focus areas for action remain relevant. At appraisal, climate change and
environment were (and remain) among the core areas of engagement under the Bank’s
Country Partnership Strategy. The Bank recognized Indonesia’s potential as a leader in
mitigating and adapting to climate change and anticipated facilitating access to global climate
finance, supporting reforms and investments in the forestry and energy sectors, and working
to increase resilience to disasters. The operation also supported the GOI in harmonizing
policies and coordinating across institutions to improve the GOI’s climate response and
potential to access global climate finance.

The Bank and development partners continue to assist the GOI to establish appropriate
policies, implement programs and stimulate investment to reduce emissions from forest and
land use loss and degradation, to improve energy efficiency and competitiveness, to foster
development of renewable energy resources, to prepare and prevent disasters and build
resilience, to improve water management and agricultural practices, and to improve
institutional coordination in policy making at all levels.

3.2. Achievement of Program Development Objectives

3.2.1. Overall Achievement of Objectives

The overall outcome rating for the CCDPL is moderately satisfactory. The CCDPL
aimed to support the Government’s efforts to develop a lower emission, more climate-
resilient growth path and to help in establishing a favorable policy and institutional setting to
access global climate finance opportunities and responded to the President's ambitious
climate change agenda.

In terms of access to climate finance, Indonesia has successfully accessed nearly every
possible form of global climate finance (grants, trust funds, concessional loans, program
loans, etc) and sustained substantial bilateral grant support for climate change actions that
would not ordinarily be available to a middle income country. The CCDPL contributed to the
visibility of Indonesia’s programs internationally and provided an endorsement through
development partners’ agreement on the policy reform matrix.

In terms of forests and land use, Indonesia has scaled up its REDD+ initiative and made
important reforms in a challenging institutional context. The moratorium on new forest
clearance licenses was an historic action that many sector analysts had recommended for
decades. The effort to solidify a REDD+ regulatory framework and agency is ongoing. There
continues to be resistance from entrenched interests. But the REDD+ process also has
substantial allies and has created a relatively more open and consultative process around
forest and land use issues than in the past. This result is emerging from a process of policy
reform supported by a wide range of partners and institutions over years, not least Norway’s
global efforts and the CCDPL process. Emissions reductions take time to achieve and need to
be built on a solid set of policies and programs, which Indonesia has been putting into place.
Monitoring of forest cover change is a slow process and results are not produced annually.

In terms of energy sector regulation and incentives, the picture in retrospect is more positive
than it appeared as it emerged. Indonesia now has a reasonable system of feed-in tariffs for
                                               10
renewable energy and prioritized plans for promoting energy efficiency in key sectors, as
well as experience with energy efficiency auditing. The large energy sector subsidy remains a
deep political economy issue linked to poverty alleviation, budgeting, and economic
performance, not just to climate change, and it was never part of the CCDPL program for that
reason. On the regulatory side, the framework is gradually improving through better
coordination across the energy and finance ministries, which are learning to speak a common
language across a large institutional divide in terms of mandate and perspective. This
represents the challenge of making policy incrementally in a complex institutional
environment – including concerns about budget impacts, risk allocation and favoritism across
industries and firms -- more than any issue associated with climate change.

On peatland, certainly more could have been done. Peat is an important gap in the legal
framework and is not adequately captured under the responsibilities of any one agency.
Indonesia could do more to bring the appropriate players together and develop an approach
that makes some improvement over the status quo, which makes these lands nearly an open
access resource with little oversight or control.

Indonesia made efforts on issues related to water resources and management, agricultural
resilience, coastal threats and livelihoods, and disaster preparedness, with the establishment
of offices in every province. This partly reflects Indonesia’s experience with earthquakes,
storms and flooding in recent years and stakeholders’ perception of the need to act. More
could reasonably be done on adaptation, particularly actions in the key areas of Indonesia’s
vulnerability and adaptation needs. However, this is an area of great uncertainty and it is
difficult to know how to prioritize and where investments will have the greatest pay off. (cf.
Turn down the heat, 2012, World Bank).

The CCDPL provided a clear program and policy direction that served as a platform for
harmonizing partner investments in key areas. CCDPL did not become the chief convening
mechanism for GOI agencies, partly due to competing political and institutional interests
compounded by changes in key officials in key agencies. A public expenditure review (by the
MOF in 2012 supported by UNDP) showed increasing resource allocations to climate
relevant activities – and that improvements in cost effectiveness and targeting were possible.

The CCDPL unfolded in the context of competition among GOI agencies over the role of
climate finance, the North-South divide in the global climate negotiations, and by changes in
power and responsibility within key Government agencies. But the objectives and actions
achieved were worthwhile and the process has stimulated further action. Experience and
capacity were developed and relationships among agencies were fostered that may provide
the confidence to continue and accelerate reforms.

3.2.2 Pillar 1 Actions Related to Mitigation 1

Peatland Conservation - Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

CCDPL recognized that the GOI had previously issued and begun implementation of a
master plan on peat land rehabilitation in Central Kalimantan. This was seen as an
opportunity to enhance policies for conserving peat from drainage, conversion and fire, one
of the country’s largest sources of emissions. Under the CCDPL series, the GOI agreed to

1
  In later documentation, the GOI and partners agreed to reorder the issues in the program document to reflect
the importance of cross cutting issues and upstream strategic actions. This also reflected the perception that
institutional and governance issues, as well as adaptation issues, should be given equal space with mitigation.
This ICR document reflects the original order of issues in the Bank’s DPL documents.
                                                      11
coordinate among ministries to control peatland emissions under the framework of
presidential regulation and to implement key steps in national multi-sector policy dialogue
establishing a legal framework for the national strategy for lowlands.

While substantial progress has been made in dialogue and regulatory initiatives have been
launched, inter-sectoral coordination and a stronger regulatory base has not yet been
achieved. The Ministry of Environment has drafted a government regulation on peatland
management (2011). In parallel, the Ministry of Public Works has developed a regulation on
Lowland/ Swamp management (2012). The two processes are based on different legal
frameworks and ministerial authorities. Some peat land is lowland and some lowland is peat
land, so the technical aspects of who regulates remain to be clarified. The two drafts provide
a firmer basis for inter-departmental consultations to determine the way forward to improved
management of these critical areas. After harmonization between the two Ministries
(ongoing), the two regulations will be issued to improve coordination mechanisms for
managing peat land and lowlands. MOE has also produced maps of Peatland Hydrological
Units in Sumatra and Kalimantan as a basis for further specifying regulatory needs.

REDD+ - Rating: Satisfactory

The CCDPL recognized Indonesia’s efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest
degradation through the implementation of a national REDD+ framework, particular the
launch of a National Readiness Program for REDD+, initiation of a regulatory framework,
and membership in both FCPF and UN-REDD. Policy commitments under CCDPL included
plans to better define roles and responsibilities of government agencies, local communities,
and the private sector in managing forest carbon assets. The GOI has made substantial
progress on its National REDD+ initiative, in parallel with the CCDPL process.

The GOI is currently determining how REDD+ will operate, under the leadership of a
National REDD+ Agency to be established under the authority of the President. In the
interim, a multi-sectoral Task Force has managed the participatory and consultative process
of developing a National Strategy, selected Central Kalimantan as a pilot province, and
suspended new forest conversion licensing for two years. The GOI has made substantial
progress on creating a financing mechanism and planning for establishment of a National
REDD+ Agency. Presidential Instruction No.10/2011 on Moratorium was issued in May
2011. The REDD+ National Strategy was finalized in June 2012 and launched at the Rio +20
Conference, as well as domestically.

The GOI also exceeded targets when committing to establish and implement REDD
demonstration activities in at least 3 locations, together with partners. In fact, more than 30
REDD+ demonstration activities are operating in Indonesia with some level of recognition
from MOFR. Plans for the REDD+ Agency and financing mechanism are now in an inter-
departmental review process, expected to lead to approval by the President. This is a complex
agenda and further progress, and possibly some setbacks, can be expected.

Forest Management and Governance – Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

This action aimed to improve forest governance and management through the establishment
of improved rules on Forest Management Units (FMU), financial incentive scheme for local
governments, and timber legality. FMUs are work units of local governments that can
perform site-level forest management and medium- to long-term planning depending on the
designated conservation, protection, and social functions of the forest. FMUs are designed to
be staffed by professionals on matters pertaining to forest and land-use planning and
                                              12
monitoring, forest protection, investment and work opportunity development, and engaging
with forest stakeholders including concessionaires and forest communities.

The CCDPL acknowledged the GOI (Ministry of Forestry, MOFR) effort to improve forest
management and governance through establishment of Forest Management Units. In 2010,
the MOHA and MOFOR issued key regulations regarding norms, procedures, and technical
standards of FMU management. Using this regulatory base, the GOI established 22 model
FMUs (across the Protection, Production, and Conservation forest areas) in 2010 and an
additional 77 Model FMUs in 2011. The establishment of FMU’s should provide a
framework for decentralizing management of forest areas and managing for multiple uses, in
conjunction with communities and local stakeholders.

The CCDPL recognized the GOI’s achievement in issuing regulations to establish a national
timber legality standard and a system for verification and monitoring (SVLK) to assist in
reducing illegal logging and forest loss. Building on this, the GOI issued decrees for
assessing the capacity for oversight, certification and monitoring in the National Standards
Agency. After pilot testing with 11 firms, the timber legality system was implemented
through 115 timber industries, 4 natural forest concessionaires, and 1 industrial timber
plantations up to June 2011. Having established a this domestic timber legality system, the
GOI Voluntary Partnership Agreement in May 2011 with the European Union, allowing
Indonesian timber products to compete in European markets. In December 2012 the UKP4,
the KPK, the Ministries of Forestry, Environment, the Attorney General’s Office, the
National Police, and the Center for Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis (PPATK)
signed a Memorandum of Understanding to coordinate efforts towards law enforcement
related to crimes in the forest and peatland sectors.

The above policy achievements demonstrate progress toward the PDO Indicator 3 (illegal
logging cases) because that data source was discontinued by the MOFOR after 2009. It is
expected that further investment in the FMU agenda will promote improved forest
management and governance, due to more professional management closer to forest areas,
greater ownership and management of forest areas by local governments, and improved
engagement with forest stakeholders, notably concession holders and forest communities.

Renewable Energy Development - Rating: Satisfactory

The CCDPL recognized the need to improve energy security and reduce future GHG
emissions from electricity generation through new geothermal projects within an improved
policy framework for private sector participation. The operation recognized the GOI’s effort
to issue national and ministerial regulations to mandate the development and purchase of
power from renewable energy resources, to establish a ceiling price for geothermal power
purchase, to establish the purchase price of electricity from renewable energy sources, and to
provide tax incentives for renewable energy development.

In subsequent actions, the GOI aimed to improve the policy framework for promoting and
identify financing needs to mitigate upstream risk of geothermal projects. In 2010, MOF,
MEMR and BAPPENAS completed studies toward a policy framework for geothermal
development, including a risk mitigation mechanism and tender process improvements.
Based on this, the GOI established a Rp 1.16 trillion fund for upstream exploration drilling as
a means of mitigating risk and stimulating investment in the subsector. Subsequent MOF
decrees established the Geothermal Fund (financial mechanism) and appointed the Centre for
Government Investment as its manager.

                                              13
Through an iterative process over several years, the GOI clarified the scheme of
compensation for the incremental cost of geothermal electricity to off-takers. A Presidential
Regulation in 2010 established a higher compensation level for geothermal electricity. Later,
a regulation obliged the national electricity company (PLN) to purchase geothermal power at
a maximum price of US$0.097 per kWh. Also, MOF issued regulations that provided for a
Guarantee Letter for PLN, later in August 2011. Progress on signing power purchase
agreements between PLN and independent power producers was substantially better than
expected. Six new PPAs were signed by March 2011 for total 435 MW geothermal power
and another 4 PPAs were signed by October 2012. The GOI then gradually expanded this
regulatory approach to other renewable energy sectors. Regulations in 2010 and 2011
provided incentives for renewable energy development and implemented valued added taxes
for fuel subsidies. Feed in Tariffs rules for solar and wind were completed in 2012.

In 2011, the Government began the development of two power plants of approximately 110
MW and approximately 40 MW at the Ulubelu and Lahendong (Tompaso) geothermal fields,
respectively, alongside the construction of a Steamfield Above-Ground System. These
activities are partially funded by the Geothermal Clean Energy Investment Project for
Indonesia and supported by the World Bank, and are meant to increase the utilization of clean
geothermal-based electricity to reduce pollution and improve the environment. They also are
useful pilots for installing major geothermal capacity on islands outside of Java, and help to
diversity the nationwide energy mix towards renewable energy sources.

Energy Efficiency - Rating: Satisfactory

CCDPL acknowledged GOI efforts to reduce emissions by enhanced energy efficiency in
energy intensive sectors through the use of new technology and the rehabilitation, renovation
and replacement of existing facilities. As prior actions, the GOI had issued a Government
Regulation on Energy Conservation and implemented a national system of energy audits for
major firms in key sectors.

In the years following CCDPL, the Ministry of Industry developed a Grand Strategy for
energy conservation in the industrial sector (with financing from ICCTF), with the first phase
of implementation started in September 2010, and a second phase in June 2011. The strategy
included technical needs assessment, energy manager training and standard operation
procedures. Outputs of the work with 35 steel companies and 15 pulp and paper companies,
and 9 cement companies included energy and emissions baselines, energy management
information systems, capacity building, technical guidelines, investment audits, and
dissemination events. The Ministry of Industry also finalized technical guidance on emissions
reductions for the cement industry. MEMR also completed work on a framework, known as
REFF-Burn: An Integrated Program for Reducing Emission from Fossil Fuel Burning. In
other actions related to energy conservation, MEMR drafted a master plan for energy
conservation (RIKEN) including energy efficiency standards, an energy audit program and a
monitoring and evaluating framework, in collaboration with MOI. The RIKEN and related
rules were in draft as of late 2012, awaiting finalization and approval. MEMR issued
Regulation No.6/2011 on the procedures and performance tests for Energy Saving Lamps.

3.2.3 Pillar 2 Actions Related to Adaptation and Disaster Preparedness

Water Resources – Rating: Highly Satisfactory

CCDPL recognized the GOI’s issuance of a Presidential Regulation to establish and staff the
National Water Resource Council – a multi-stakeholder body designed to formulate water
                                             14
policies at the national government level – and efforts to prepare integrated water resource
management plans (POLA) with climate change assessment in national strategic river basins.
In 2010 and beyond, Indonesia continued efforts to improve water resource management for
adaptation in strategic river basins. MPW made further progress on strategic assessment of
the water future of Java, and prepared an action plan for priority interventions as part of the
River Basin Strategic Water Management Plans.

In 2010, provincial water councils were formed in 18 provinces, and 8 River Basin
Management Plans were approved by the Minister of Public Works. Four additional plans
were approved in 2011, and draft master plans were completed for 2 key River Basins on.
The monitoring indicator was to increase the number of water management plans from 3 at
baseline to 12 by 2012. At this time, a total of 29 have been approved for basis under
provincial authority and 13 for basins under the jurisdiction of the national government, or
350% over the target. These plans establish a uniform information baseline and adaptive
management approaches that will help basin managers adapt to an uncertain future.

Climate Resilient Agriculture – Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

CCDPL recognized the GOI’s effort to develop an irrigation asset management information
system and implement a rice production intensification program and climate field schools in
target provinces. In the following implementation periods, MOA continued to strengthen and
scale up efforts to improve resilience of farm production and reduce drought risk. The System
for Rice Intensification (SRI) was completed in 62 units of 8 provinces (16 districts). The
Climate Field School program completed 261 units in 29 provinces (243 districts) by two
directorates within the Ministry of Agriculture. In 2011, 599 units were completed.
Technical Guidance related to Climate Field School (based on Presidential Instruction No.
5/2011) was issued in March 2011. The guidance focuses on measures to control pests and
disease caused by climate change impact and water management in non-irrigated areas.

Disaster Risk Management – Rating: Satisfactory

CCDPL noted that the GOI enacted the law on Disaster Management and established a
National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), finalized and launched the National Action
Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction, and integrated Disaster Risk Reduction and climate change
adaptation into the medium term development plan (RPJMN, 2009). Following in 2010 and
2011, the GOI fulfilled the commitment to establish Local Disaster Management Agencies
(BPBD) in all provinces with 32 at the end of 2010 and the final one in Papua, established in
2011. These agencies are now budgeted regularly and functioning according to their allocated
tasks. Capacity strengthening activities are ongoing with support from several sources,
including GFDRR. As of 2013, the BNPB reports that 33 of 34 provinces (the latest province
being established in December 2012) have functioning, budgeted, and staffed BPBDs, with
up to 400 branch offices established at the district-level.

The monitoring indicator was the percentage of farmers that showed understanding and
practicing of adaptation techniques, relative to a baseline that was to be created during the
project. The 2010 baseline was not established over the one-year duration of the project, so
data is not available for this policy area.

Marine and Fisheries – Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Under CCDPL, GOI was recognized for launching the National Plan of Action of Coral
Triangle Initiative and approving a roadmap of CTI actions for 2010-11. In subsequent years,
                                              15
the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) continued to strengthen the
institutional and regulatory framework to manage coastal zones and to increase coastal
community resilience. MMAF’s Climate Resilient Village planning project for coastal area
was completed in mid 2010; this entailed detailed engineering, implement the design and
develop the community resilience through workshop and training; also a Strategic Plan for a
model coastal village was finalized in 2011 for Tanjung Pansir Village, Banten Province. In
2010, MMAF also completed a study on coastal vulnerability in relation to sea level rise in
Java and Bali and another in West Sumatra. These studies resulted in a more comprehensive
draft strategic plan and recommendations for wider coastal vulnerability application in
Indonesia. MMAF also reviewed and updated its Strategic Plan for Blue Carbon Research in
Indonesia for 2011-2014 and released the plan for public review.

The monitoring indicator for this area was the percentage of coastal communities in 8
districts on the north coast of Java that showed a greater awareness and changed practices,
relative to a baseline to be created over the duration of the CCDPL. The baseline was not
established during the project life, so data are not available for this policy area.

Climate Forecasting and Impact and Vulnerability Assessment – Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory

After the initial CCDPL period, the GOI and Development Partners agreed to add a focus
area on climate forecasting and vulnerability assessment. Under this focal area Indonesia took
the following important steps to strengthen the institutional framework and capacity for
scientific research on adaptation:
    • The Meteorological Agency (BMKG) developed a climate change modeling program
        to assess impact and vulnerability and completed 7 modeling scenarios, as well as
        vulnerability assessment study in East, Central and West Java;
    • In 2010, MMAF established the Indonesian Global Ocean Observing System
        (INAGOOS) Data Center and Secretariat in Jakarta; and
    • In 2011 the MMAF publicized its Strategic Plan (2011-2014) for INAGOOS and it
        became part of the RAN-GRK regulation.

INAGOOS is the Indonesian counterpart to the Global Ocean Observing System, an
international program (coordinated by UNESCO-IOC) meant to coordinate ocean
observations and provide modeling and technical analysis support. INAGOOS monitors
ocean climate phenomena and provides information to meet GOI’s demand for high-quality
and timely information relevant to sound policy and decision making.

3.2.4 Pillar 3 Actions Related to Cross Sectoral and Institutional Issues

Mainstreaming Climate Change in the National Development Program - Rating:
Satisfactory

Under CCDPL, the GOI was recognized for finalizing the 2nd National Communication to the
UNFCCC, submitting mitigation actions under the Copenhagen Accord in January 2010, and
issuing key development planning documents related to climate change, as well as the RPJM.
Later in 2010, the GOI went on to finalize the Indonesia Climate Change Sectoral Roadmap
(ICCSR), which became the basis for further actions. The presidential decree on National
Action Plan for 26% GHG voluntary reduction (No 61/2011) was signed on September 26,
2011 (a delay from the original plan). This formalized the commitment and specified the
necessary actions of line ministries and regional governments.

                                              16
Policy Coordination and Financing for Climate Change – Rating: Satisfactory

The CCDPL recognized the GOI’s achievement in issuing the National Action Plan
Addressing Climate Change, establishing a National Council on Climate Change, and
launching the Indonesia Climate Change Trust Fund (October 2009). In terms of climate
financing, following the establishment of the Indonesia Climate Change Trust Fund (ICCTF),
the GOI evaluated proposals and funded $4 million worth of projects from Ministries of
Agriculture, Industry and the Meteorological Agency. Operating procedures and trustee
arrangements were formalized, in line with applicable Presidential Regulations.

The GOI has also succeeded in accessing climate finance resources from several global trust
funds under the Climate Investment Funds, as well as bilateral development assistance. It is
estimated that the GOI has benefited from over a billion dollars worth of climate assistance
over a five year period (including $400 million from the Clean Technology Fund, a billion
dollar pledge from Norway, and hundreds of millions in bilateral programs). This contributed
to awareness, interest and capacity to access international climate finance.

In terms of incentives for climate change action at the sub-national level, there has been some
progress on a thorny topic. MOF and BAPPENAS held discussions and developed technical
studies for improving the design of the Special Allocation Fund (DAK) to provide more
explicit climate change incentives for sub-national governments. This proved difficult
because of the cross sectoral nature of climate change and the sectoral nature of the existing
DAK (19 sectors, Rp. 25 Trillion in 2011). As an interim alternative, the GOI increased the
allocation for the forestry sector. In coordination, MOFOR issued Technical Guidance for
using Forestry DAK to improve incentives for better forest management in line with climate
needs. MOF continues Analytical studies on this key issue.

GHG Measurement and Monitoring - Rating: Satisfactory

In later periods, the GOI also wished to record progress in developing a monitoring
mechanism for carbon emission and absorption through establishment of a National GHG
Inventory System. After submission of the main report of the 2nd National Communication to
UNFCCC (Feb 2011), the GOI also issued a Presidential Regulation on National GHG
Inventory (No. 71/2011). Under the regulation, the Ministry of Environment is charged with
developing the National GHG Inventory System (SIGN) at the national level, with technical
inputs from the line ministries. Work is in progress at the local levels – with the support of
provincial governors and mayors – to improve data used for local and national GHG
inventories. By 2014, the Government plans to have established a solid foundation for GHG
inventory preparation, in line with increased reporting requirements under the UNFCCC and
also so that inventory data can be used as a tool for effective and informed policy making.

3.3 Justification for Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The CCDPL’s objective of supporting the Government’s efforts to achieve a lower emission,
more climate-resilient growth path and to help in establishing a favorable policy and
institutional setting to access global climate finance opportunities was strategically important
and appropriate given demands from Government. The CCDPL responded specifically to the
President's ambitious climate change agenda and brought together significant financial
resources from key development partners. In a number of key areas (climate finance,
REDD+, water resources management, disaster preparedness) progress was significant, with
                                               17
outcomes exceeding initial expectations. In other areas (peatlands, energy efficiency, and
coastal adaptation areas) progress was less significant or transformative. Those areas with
less than desired achievements were hindered in part by complex regulatory environments,
and uncertainty in prioritizing investments.

As noted above, the CCDPL process was managed in an institutional landscape colored by
competition among agencies on the role and placement of climate policy and particularly
climate finance, the North-South divide in the global climate negotiations, and by changes in
power and responsibility within key Government agencies. But the objectives and actions
achieved were worthwhile and the process has stimulated further action, including the grant
and TA projects that the Bank is now managing in the climate change mitigation space.
Experience and capacity were developed and relationships among agencies were fostered that
may provide the confidence to continue and accelerate reforms.
3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

3.4.1. Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects and Social Development

In the forest sector, the Indonesia CCDPL supported efforts to reduce forest degradation,
deforestation, illegal logging, and use of fire through regulatory processes and institutional
capacity improvements. Although there is some potential for negative social and poverty
impacts depending on how a scheme for REDD or peatland management is carried out in
practice, the REDD+ process in Indonesia has been very consultative, with opportunity for
engagement with disadvantaged groups, including indigenous peoples. Investments in land
use planning, water management, and governance, as well as civil society monitoring offer
the potential to improve the positive and reduce the negative aspects of REDD
implementation. When REDD+ programs or more rigorous standards in land management are
implemented, land-use patterns and values will be affected; some will gain and others will
lose. Although there is a need for caution to ensure that policies do not unduly restrict or
disrupt local livelihoods, there is also a need to consider these potential impacts against the
‘business-as-usual’ path, which would entail continuing loss of habitat and biodiversity,
illegal logging and revenue loss, and marginalization of poor and indigenous communities.

In the energy sector, the CCDPL helped to promote investment in energy efficiency and
renewable energy through an improved regulatory framework and coordination of incentives.
More efficient energy use and pricing will also free up budgetary resources for job creation
and poverty alleviation. Policies that can affect consumer prices are linked to programs that
anticipate and avoid negative impacts on the poor, such as compensatory cash transfers.
Experience and sophistication on targeting and evaluating cash transfers has improved over
time and the GOI has demonstrated the capacity to lessen the adverse impacts on the poor. In
general, mitigation actions are likely to have positive environmental impacts, including direct
emissions reductions and co-benefits such as cleaner air, better managed watersheds, and
preservation of habitat, as well as reduced health losses associated with smoke and haze.

The CCDPL also aimed to to improve adaptation, resilience and preparedness in rice
production, water management, coastal zones and disaster response. The poverty and social
impacts of policies related to adaptation, disaster preparedness and cross-sectoral and
institutional issues are expected to be positive or neutral. Domestic investments in adaptation
help to increase the resilience of the resource dependent poor, both in coastal and inland
areas, as well as the urban poor exposed to flooding, disease and extreme weather events. In
the medium to long run, adaptation efforts will help the poor to be more prepared for climate
related changes, even though there is some uncertainty. Climate change has definitely

                                              18
brought new forms of financing to Indonesia, including investments at local level,
participatory processes, information exchange and livelihood programs.

3.4.2. Institutional Strengthening

The CCDPL aimed to improve institutional coordination and capacity for climate change
response, which will help Indonesia in the long run as the effects of climate change become
more apparent. The program aimed to strengthen coordination and regulation of peat land
issues, an area of weakness in current law and practice. It also aimed to strengthen the body
of knowledge, policy and guidance on climate mitigation and adaptation. Through dialogue
processes and policy discussions, the CCDPL helped key GOI agencies understand links
between sectors and levels of the economy and create networks of practitioners with a
common understanding and approach to addressing climate change over the medium term.


3.4.3. Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

As noted above, there are a number of co-benefits associated with climate change mitigation,
including reduced air and water pollution, reduced health risks associated with fire/haze,
improved production and delivery of environmental services, greater energy efficiency and
international competitiveness. These are not unintended, but non-quantified, outcomes and
impacts. On the institutional side, the CCDPL process unfolded in parallel with an overall
increase in the level of interest, attention and action on climate change among the central
planning and finance ministries that allocate resources and address trade-offs. This has led to
stronger leadership on cross cutting issues and program level responses, such as planning for
greener and more sustainable development. This is in contrast to an approach based around
more narrow sectoral interests and a competition for resources and policy influence.

3.5 Summary of Stakeholder Workshops

The lead GOI regularly convened technical working groups and steering committees that
invited cross sectoral participation. Meetings were used to clarify the nature and rationale for
the CCDPL program and to track progress against indicators. These meetings served an
important function for exchanging information and views among key stakeholder agencies.


4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

The risk that the development outcomes of the CCDPL will not be maintained going forward
is rated as moderate. Three risk areas identified in the 2013-2015 CPS are relevant:
coordination, governance/corruption, and external shocks.

Weak coordination and entrenched organizational behaviors may undermine capacity
to develop and implement complex institutional reforms. Commitment to policy reform at
the highest levels of government and in strategic, planning and budgeting documents remains
strong; however, the ability to deliver reforms across a wide agenda and multiple institutions
remains weak. Institutional rivalries undermine the capacity to craft and implement integrated
policies across key sectors, including energy and land use. Decision making on complex and
sensitive issues is fragmented and only intermittent progress can be expected over the next
year of electoral transition. On the positive side, key agencies and reformers now advocate
moving toward a greener, more sustainable development path, beyond the core climate
agenda of mitigation and adaptation. The next medium term development plan presents the
                                              19
opportunity to codify some key policies and programs for the longer term. The scope of the
challenge is large: success will require action across legal mandates and economic interests
from forestry, agriculture, mining, land use and local governments. Success will mean
building sustainability concerns and incentives into rapidly growing and profitable economic
sectors, in particular oil palm plantations. The Bank’s current CPS aims to strengthen
institutional capacity via technical assistance and analytical support for the design and
implementation of the government’s reform agenda. Many of the policy areas identified in
the CCDPL remain important in this context.

Weak governance and the potential for corruption also represent risks going forward.
Entrenched economic interests have the motivation and capacity to resist needed reforms.
Addressing climate change mitigation and adaptation will require actions that touch on key
economic sectors, as well as increased awareness and implementation capacity at the local
level. On the positive side, there has been important progress on land use and forestry issues,
particularly with the Government’s “One Map? initiative and the recent two year extension of
the moratorium on forest clearance licenses. On the other hand, local officials and elites still
collude to produce changes on the ground, even where national laws and policies are sound.
An example is continuing unwillingness to enforce bans on use of fire for land clearing.
Along with better coordination, the GOI will need better communication about the economic
sustainability rationale for environmental and climate improvements, including the benefits
and trade-offs for specific groups of stakeholders. The planning and finance ministries
increasingly recognize the need for comprehensive rationale and solid analytical base to
justify a greener development agenda, as well as the need to use communication and dialogue
to forge understanding across stakeholder groups on green development opportunities and
challenges, based on clear rationales and sound evidence. Development partners are
increasingly supporting these key ministries with integrated policy analysis, technical
assistance and capacity development in this area.

Indonesia continues to be vulnerable to economic shocks, which could threaten
available financing for climate related actions. Indonesia’s economic performance
continues to be relatively solid, due to growing domestic demand and good export potential.
Recent success in reducing the fossil fuel subsidy is a sign of progress and could provide
some fiscal space for investment in a more climate friendly path. However, the Bank
believes that higher growth could be achieved with better policies and more coordination.
Macroeconomic and financial management continue to be key elements of the Bank’s
engagement and policy dialogue, including under the ongoing economic DPL series.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1. Bank Performance Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

5.1.1. Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Climate Change DPL was one of the first operations of its type for the Bank, certainly in
East Asia. The design was based on good analytical work and the Government’s own
assessments of sectoral needs and priorities. It was also responsive to the agenda’s of the core
economic and planning ministries in terms of stimulating a response to the President’s
commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The reforms that were recognized as part of
the Bank’s CCDPL were a carefully selected subset of a broader range of actions. The Bank
                                              20
aimed to become involved in a few key areas with potential for positive impact and where the
Bank had substantial sectoral engagement and knowledge.

A multi-disciplinary team comprised of Bank staff and consultants (Annex 1) helped to
prepare the CCDPL, in consultation with Government and development partners. The team
conducted appropriate environmental and social assessments of the policies targeted in the
operation, in line with OP 8.60. The number of staff weeks (59.57) and the preparation costs
(US$ 227,193) required for the operation are consistent with similar DPLs of its size.

The Government of Japan/JICA and the AFD initiated the Climate Change Program Loan in
concert with the GOI and based the early design on the GOI’s “Development Response to
Climate Change,? published in 2008. The Bank participated in early discussions of the
program loan concept, but chose not to participate in the operation until the GOI’s institutions
and priorities for climate change policy reform were more firmly established. By 2010,
particularly after the high level attention of the President and several years’ experience with
climate change analysis and institutional coordination, the Bank determined that the
conditions were conducive for this operation. The Bank entered the operation in its third year
based on its assessment of the availability of a meaningful entry-point into forestry and
energy sector issues, as well as policy progress on the national coordinating mechanism.
Based on these considerations, the timing of entry for the CCDPL operation was judged to be
appropriate. However, the Bank’s late entry to the program created some need for
adjustments by the partners and GOI agencies in the selection and focus of policy actions.
Harmonization of the policy dialogue and interpretation of the results of the monitoring
process were complicated by having more partners with different documentation
requirements and approval processes. This concern was echoed in the Borrower’s comments
in the next section.

Before 2010, the policy matrix that the GOI was tracking with the development partners
included many actions across many sectors. With the Bank’s entry into the dialogue, there
was an effort to streamline and prioritize to three pillars and eleven policy areas. Even after
this streamlining, the program touched on many issues and sectors across many responsible
agencies. Several individual ministries expressed their strong desire that their programs be
included in the CCDPL in order to be recognized in relation to the high visibility climate
change issue. In particular, the desire for balance between adaptation actions and mitigation
actions led to inclusion of more sectors and more actions, some of which were less
transformative. On the positive side, this breadth reflected the climate change challenge in
Indonesia, responded to the GOI’s requests for inclusion, and created entry points with
sectors and ministries seen to be important in the long run, such as agriculture. However, on
the negative side, this inclusive approach diluted the depth of analysis and dialogue that could
be achieved and created monitoring challenges, as discussed below.

5.1.2 Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Supervision of the CCDPL was conducted during the follow up period and preparation for the
second operation in the series, where progress against actions was assessed. Supervision
activities were relatively continuous and involved regular meetings among the development
partners and with the government counterparts. A few intensive joint missions were
scheduled around delegations visiting from the partners’ headquarters offices. Supervision
also involved regular workshops and technical discussions convened by BAPPENAS around
specific technical or policy issues of high concern. Development partners with smaller teams
                                              21
on the ground had to be selective in determining where and when to participate. As part of the
supervision process, JICA and AFD provided the services of a monitoring team from a
consultancy firm and a forestry expert respectively. This provided the manpower needed to
follow up with specific ministries and directorates and get detailed updates on specific policy
actions and indicators.

Upon assessment, it would have been more effective for GOI officials to lead monitoring
efforts with line ministries/responsible agencies, rather than technical consultants. This would
have provide more direct feedback from the policy actions (and challenges being faced) to the
senior officials managing the CCDPL process on behalf of the GOI.

5.1.3. Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The CCDPL was strategically relevant and timely for the Government and the Bank. The
partners maintained an active and open dialogue with the Government through a series of
formal and informal meetings and multi-sectoral workshops. The Bank also ensured that the
policy areas selected were supported by good analytical work and – together with
Development Partners – helped to direct technical assistance to key areas as needed.

5.2. Borrower Performance

5.2.1. Government Performance Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

This section covers the central agencies leading the process and convening dialogue on the
policy agenda under the CCDPL. BAPPENAS, assisted by Ministry of Finance, lead the
CCDPL preparation process, effectively coordinating across departments, convening key
meetings, and maintaining dialogue with development partners. The Government
counterparts were closely involved in defining the overall framework and adjusting the
balance of actions across sectors, ensuring that it was not solely a mitigation program.
Steering Committee meetings provided a venue for senior officials and development partners
to review progress and performance on agreed policy indicators.

The GOI documented meetings, reviewed policy performance at mid and senior level, and
managed the process on a time schedule consistent with development partners’ needs for
processing operations. Due to the needed time commitment, the GOI central agencies were
not involved continuously in progress monitoring meetings and tracking of indicators at
activity level. Having GOI officials more involved and visible in the process may have
signaled greater commitment and ownership to the technical ministries. In hindsight,
integrating the progress monitoring role into the institutional framework of BAPPENAS
would have provided greater opportunity to manage and monitor the success of the reform
process. At the time, however, it would have been a challenge for BAPPENAS to take on this
role. In 2013, BAPPENAS is now planning a monitoring framework as part of its
implementation activities of the national and local mitigation action plans (RAN and RAD-
GRK).

Regarding involvement of line ministries for greater effectiveness, the central agencies
steering the policy dialogue need to provide a more compelling rational and incentives for the
participation of line ministries that are charged with delivering program results. On a related
                                              22
point, there could have been better integration and articulation of the link between the GOI’s
financing needs and the policy program. Sometimes there were different signals from
different quarters on the overall need for borrowing and the balance among partners. Clearer
communication of intentions regarding the policy program relative to the need for borrowing
would have been helpful, particularly regarding the preparation and later cancellation of the
follow on operations.

5.2.2. Implementing Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Most participant agencies valued the convening process of the DPL as an opportunity to share
information across sectors and learn about what other agencies were doing about climate
change issues. Some agencies valued the DPL process to gain recognition and visibility for
their programs, as well as interest and financial/technical support from development partners;
indeed, some agencies volunteered actions for the policy matrix, sometimes even with too
much detail. Other agencies resisted the idea of being coordinated or giving something up
(policy advances) for little in return (budget resources).

Initially, and at key decision meetings, ownership and commitment were visible at higher
levels of Government, particularly the Ministry of Finance and BAPPENAS. Later, in more
routine monitoring meetings and workshops, participation was at a lower level. Large
meetings of middle level officials were not an effective venue for addressing important cross
cutting issues or bureaucratic/coordination challenges. Although the aim of these meetings
was to resolve difficult, cross cutting, priority issues, some officials may have felt targeted in
this setting to explain weak performance. This may have reduced the incentive for active
participation. As an alternative, there could have been a clearer process for elevating key
concerns to higher levels for resolution in more focused meetings. Although there were cases
where high level or informal interventions were used to stimulate participation or encourage
greater performance, these were (understandably) not well documented or shared with
external partners like the Bank.

5.2.3. Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The Government exhibited good ownership of the program. The policy reforms included in
the matrix were in line with the needs and priorities identified in GOI planning and analytical
documents. The Ministry of Finance and BAPPENAS in particular contributed to the quality
of the program by convening and managing the process, documenting discussions and
decisions, and elevating key issues to more senior levels for resolution. The Government
helped to identify areas where additional resources or technical assistance were needed and to
meet those needs (e.g., with grants under ICCTF). The CCDPL served as a platform for
bringing together a wide range of agencies that need to work together to address Indonesia’s
climate challenges.

However, the GOI could have done more on communicating the aims of the program and the
role of the policy operation to the responsible agencies, participating in and internalizing the
performance monitoring effort with the responsible agencies. The GOI could also have
communicated more openly with Development Partners about its changing positions or
priorities regarding the CCDPL series.

                                               23
6. Lessons Learned

Key lessons learned from the CCDPL process include the need for strong institutional
support for the policy program, clear communication about priorities and changing priorities,
and monitoring and feedback linked into the policy making process.

Champions are needed, but institutional engagement too. Development programs need
champions to drive an agenda and make progress toward key milestones and outcomes. But
there is also the risk that complex programs become dependent on the skills or ambitions of a
few people, rather than becoming embedded in the vision and mission of an agency with a
reach beyond the individual’s grasp. High level champions have used DPL operations to
drive important policy reforms within a core set of key ministries with convergent aims.
When the DPL model was extended across a wider range of sectors and issues, as in CCDPL
and IDPL, the capacity to bring high level attention to all issues was diminished. Changes in
some players reduced drive to achieve results, possibly because institutional priorities were
not fully aligned for all participating agencies.

Clear and open communication is needed for strong partnership, and climate finance is
a political issue. The role of loans in addressing climate change became a communication
challenge for this operation. The role of policy loans in development finance was a
communication challenge with the line ministries responsible for delivering results. Wider
and more regular communication about these sorts of issues would help to clarify
expectations and intentions, strengthening the partnership.

GOI leadership is needed on the policy program, but also the monitoring program.
More involvement in monitoring and tracking of indicators at activity level could have sent a
stronger signal to technical ministries, provided greater opportunity to steer the policy
process, and provided feedback to senior management.

Policy based operations provide an important convening instrument. The CCDPL
process brought together policy makers, policy implementers, development partners and other
stakeholders in a dialogue process. This was relatively unique at the time for the breadth of
issues covered and the number of agencies convened. However, the number of agencies and
actions covered also created challenges for communicating clearly about the rationale for the
operation, the use of the funds, and the links to the specific policy actions. The time and
resource commitment needed to do this successfully should not be underestimated.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

Comments from the Borrower

The GOI provided verbal comments directly on the draft ICR. Insights on lessons learned and
the attention to the results framework demonstrates ownership by the Government over the
climate change and green development agenda. The Government expressed its support on the
utility of the CCDPL in coordinating and mainstreaming climate change as a national
development priority and also provided constructive inputs on the Bank’s performance,
particularly at the entry stage and in regards to monitoring and evaluation efforts.

                                             24
   •   Overall, the program was useful in mainstreaming climate change into national
       development planning and helped to advance the climate change agenda into relevant
       action plans. The presence of a unified policy matrix consistent across ministries and
       agencies is now apparent in the RAN-GRK and the Indonesia Climate Change
       Sectoral Roadmap, as well as the National Medium-Term Development Plan (2010-
       2014). The CCDPL and CCPL contributed to this policy coordination and were useful
       for their convening and coordinating functions. Furthermore, BAPPENAS benefited
       from the valuable insights into the development of a monitoring system for national
       development planning;
   •   The policy matrix in the CCDPL and CCPL operations required a negotiation process
       between the Borrower and development partners in order to focus on key areas;
   •   The program promoted important new policies in relevant sectors and enhanced
       coordination and communication among relevant ministries. Several key policies and
       programs were mainstreamed as a result of the program, including REDD+,
       renewable energy policies related to geothermal development, and watershed
       management. As above, the CCDPL was a useful convening mechanism to fast-track
       important cross-cutting programs across Government ministries and agencies;
   •   Inter-ministry and inter-agency communications could have been stronger. The
       Borrower noted the difficulty in harmonizing efforts across the various actors
       involved in the CCDPL, particularly in monitoring and evaluation, and added
       incentives could have been provided to the line ministries;
   •   On Bank performance, the Borrower noted that the Bank’s entry and choice of policy
       actions could have been better synchronized with the existing policy matrix agreed
       upon for the CCPL. There were challenges in the coordination of monitoring and
       evaluation efforts, given the difficult of measuring policy achievements or setbacks
       across two M+E frameworks;
   •   On the assessment of outcomes against agreed objectives, progress was judged to be
       strongest in the forestry and water management sectors, particularly in the promotion
       of forest rehabilitation efforts, Forest Management Units (FMUs) and Water Resource
       Management Plans (POLA)
   •   On the risk to the development outcome, the Borrower determined that the risk of
       project achievements not being maintained was low, citing the high visibility of
       climate change and environmental sustainability outcomes in national development
       planning documents including the RAN-GRK. Energy subsidies, however, remain a
       highly politicized issue requiring champions throughout the executive and legislative
       branches of the Government. Recently there has been progress on this issue, with the
       Parliament recently approving a budget package (June 2013) to reduce fuel subsidies
       and provide cash handouts to cushion the impact on impoverished households.

The comments provided by the Borrower on the ICR are in accordance with the perspective
and assessment taken by the ICR. The comments have been fully incorporated and the Bank
has no comment on issues raised.

b) Cofinanciers

Comments from AFD
The AFD described the ICR as well documented, precise and accurate in terms of analysis.
AFD’s comments focused on aspects of the monitoring and evaluation process, including the
hiring of a forestry expert financed by AFD and the continuation of the monitoring and
evaluation effort after the close of the CCDPL in 2011. AFD also noted that a fully internal
monitoring effort by the GOI may not have been feasible at the beginning of the CCDPL and

                                             25
parallel CCPL (JICA and AFD) operations, and that as part of the future implementation of
the RAN/RAD-GRK, Bappenas is planning to use a monitoring framework.

Comments from JICA
JICA noted that the CCDPL ICR was concise and clear, and useful for the completion
appraisal process that they are conducting the CCPL. JICA noted the establishment of the
Climate Change working group under BAPPENAS, as well as the fact that other institutions
established over the course of the CCPL and CCDPL (including the Ministry of Enviroment’s
National GHG Inventory System, the Ministry of Finance’s Climate Change Center, and
BAPPENAS’ RAN-GRK Secretariat) could be considered as unintended positive impacts of
the CCPL and CCDPL. JICA noted that BAPPENAS took a central role in the monitoring of
the policy matrix and the technical consultants provided support on updating the policy
matrix. Similar to the Bank’s findings above, the line ministries lacked clear incentive to
actively participate in the CCPL and CCDPL monitoring and evaluation process, despite their
having made good contributions to technical meetings for the inter-ministerial discussions
and provided data for the policy matrix. JICA flagged the need to examine the program loan
incentive framework for lime ministries as an important lesson from the process.

The Bank’s views on the above comments are in accordance with AFD and JICA and there is
no further Bank comment.

Annex 5. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments from AFD

The Agence Française de Développement (AFD) became involved in the Climate Change
Program Loan (CCPL) from its beginning in 2008 together with the lead co-financier, JICA.
All through the three yearly cycles, AFD provided US$ 800 million of soft loans to the
Government of Indonesia. This three-year programme aimed to encourage necessary public
policy development in order to fight climate change (by reducing GHG emissions and
adaptation). Each of the three annual engagements was supposed to accompany climate-
related public policy decisions or physical projects.

This support was accompanied by continuous follow-up activities and targeted technical
collaboration. Alongside the loans; AFD funded targeted expertise to help implement specific
actions on a grant basis. Indeed it was found critical to maintain dialogue with those
ministries charged with implementing the different programmes or reforms. Relations with
coordinating bodies (Bappenas, NCCC or environment ministry) are also important given
their essential coordination role. To this end, technical assistance is essential.

Consequently, in addition to the provision of a forestry expert from CIRAD supporting
Bappenas regarding methodological approaches and contributing to the monitoring of the
programme, the AFD provided support to the NCCC and to the Ministries of Forestry and
Industry related to: (i) Feasibility of a small scale Indonesian green carbon market, (ii) Land
use planning with regard to climate considerations, (iii) the NCCC and McKinsey & Co's
GHG abatement cost curve, (iv) GHG emission reductions in the cement industry.

The rationale behind CCPL was to support the strong engagement of the Indonesian
Government in fighting climate change, as reflected by the repeated announcements that
Indonesia would reduce its GHG emissions by 26% by 2020 compared with the business-as-
usual scenario, made by the Indonesian President (from Pittsburgh G20 summit in 2009, to
COP15 and Indonesia's own communication at the end of January 2010 as part of the
Copenhagen accord). This political commitment was ultimately translated into a National
Mitigation Action Plan (the so-called RAN-GRK approved at the end of 2011) and Provincial
Mitigation Action Plan (the RAD-GRK developed in 2012). It is to be noted that that
momentum initiated by the Government of Indonesia around the fight against climate change
has been kept even beyond the end of CCPL, resulting in the structuring of its climate policy.
Initially uncoordinated climate-related actions launched by different actors are now being
coordinated with one another, especially through NCCC and RAN/RAD-GRK.

Comments from JICA

Japan has been assisting developing countries to tackle sustainable development and climate
change since the Kyoto Initiative in 1997. In 2009, Japan announced its Fast-Start Financing
under the Copenhagen Accord of 15 billion dollars up to 2012. This financing aims to assist
developing countries make efforts to reduce emissions or that are particularly vulnerable to
climate change. JICA, as an executing agency of Japan’s official development assistance,
undertakes many climate change projects and programs in developing countries through its
three schemes for development assistance: technical cooperation, grant aid and ODA loans.
JICA has been tackling climate change including both mitigation and adaptation measures in
developing countries as a critical part of development issues since 2008. Japan’s climate


                                              29
assistance to developing countries emphasizes a co-benefits approach, which aims to promote
double dividends of sustainable development and climate change mitigation and adaptation.

The Climate Change Program Loan (CCPL) in Indonesia was an innovative scheme to
facilitate the implementation of climate change policies through financial and technical
assistance for developing countries in alignment with their national development policies and
strategies. JICA signed a CCPL Agreement with Indonesia in September 2008 as its first
case, with co-financing from AFD. Working with Indonesia’s key ministries, JICA conducted
monitoring and provided advisory support to Indonesia to achieve implementation of the
National Action Plan addressing Climate Change. During the period 2008 to 2010, JICA,
AFD and Indonesia signed the 2nd and 3rd CCPL agreements after updating of the policy
matrix to improve effective, feasible and tangible policy actions based on year-round
monitoring. The policy actions covered in the CCPL process were developed based on
dialogue with key agencies and based on specific measures in national programs. JICA
played a leading role in facilitating coordination among agencies and development partners,
which contributed to achieving a high level of dialogue and transparency throughout the
program formulation. Also JICA facilitated the process by conducting a number of technical
cooperation projects with various ministries for accelerating implementation of key climate
change policies using Japanese knowledge and experience, and a monitoring team to assist
with establishment of baselines and verification of results.

JICA and AFD also initiated CCPL agreements with Vietnam in June 2010. In both
countries, the CCPL process was elaborated through a series of cross sectoral policy
dialogues among multiple ministries and development partners to support the implementation
of climate change related policies and strategies based on national priorities and targets. In
both countries, international collaboration and coordination was an important aspect, with
AFD and later the World Bank, providing co-financing.

The CCPL instrument (in Indonesia and in other countries) made a significant contribution to
international discussions on effective financing approaches for development and climate
change with involvement of recipient governments own instruments and initiatives. The
CCPL also demonstrated a good model for development partner cooperation in joint support
for developing countries to combat climate change by providing innovative budget support
and assisting implementation of actions defined in a policy results matrix.

The CCPL program supported Indonesia’s policy framework to combat climate change based
on a policy matrix. The regular supervision of this matrix demonstrated performance in
achieving results and led to the allocation of new financing following the same approach. In
the East Asia Region, JICA has been also engaged in climate change activities in Vietnam
and Thailand, in the areas of adaptation and mitigation, policy support, capacity development,
institutional strengthening, mass transit, remote sensing, and research into new technologies.
In the coming years, JICA will be building on this approach, which has shown results in Asia,
and pursuing further partnerships.
