2.     Project implementation has been satisfactory. The fully disbursed original Loan
closed on December 31, 2010. An Additional Financing Loan was approved by the
Board on November 9, 2011. As of October 20, 2011, that Loan has disbursed US$253
million (20 percent). The closing date is December 31, 2013. There are no significant
changes in project objectives or activities or in administration of the loan and project.

3.      The proposed reallocation is necessary because the Ministry of Finance and
Public Credit has withheld the authorization necessary for the National Coordination of
Oportunidades to use loan resources to cover operating costs. In order to be able to
utilize fully the loan, the Borrower is requesting a reallocation of the resources now in
Category 3, “Operating Costs? to Category 1, “Oportunidades Grants?. We do not
expect any fiduciary issues to arise as a result of this reallocation since existing nationally
financed processes and systems for Component 1 can manage the additional project


                                              2
resources. The operating costs which were to have been covered by the loan instead will
be              covered               by              national               resources.
