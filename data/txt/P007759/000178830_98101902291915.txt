RURAL SANITATION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:                  Republic of Nicaragua.
Amount:                    US$3.0 million equivalent.
Terms:                     17 years including 4 years of grace, with interest
at 7.9 percent.
Project Description:       The project seeks to improve basic sanitation
services to rural areas by providing an integrated
program of water supply, latrines, sanitary house
improvements, health education and child immuni-
zation. About 172,000 people (1971 Census) in about
550 dispersed villages would benefit from the
project, with an estimated 250,000 to be served in
these villages by 1988; the population to be
reached is made up mostly of persons within the
lowest income groups in Nicaragua. Most of the
project benefits are unquantifiable (increased work
productivity, increase in effective nutrition), and
with an integrated project of this nature it is
difficult to isolate the benefits of each component.
It is clear, however, that the project will contri-
bute substantially to improvements in health and
welfare generally, as reflected in the provision of
safe water, increased life expectancy and reduced
mortality rates of infants and young children.
Although limited experience of the executing agency
and substantial dependence on community participa-
tion are recognized as risks, neither is considered
likely to impede the achievement of project objec-
tives.
This, document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF NICARAGUA
FOR A RURAL SANITATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
for the equivalent of US$3.0 million to the Republic of Nicaragua for a Rural
Sanitation Project. The loan would have a term of 17 years, including 4 years
of grace, with interest at 7.9 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A memorandum entitled "Economic Memorandum of Nicaragua" (Report
No. 914-NI) was distributed to the Executive Directors in November 1975. An
updating economic mission visited Nicaragua in June 1977 and a new report is
now being prepared. The following discussion incorporates the main findings
of the 1977 economic mission.
3.        Nicaragua's major natural resource is its arable land, which is
suitable for a variety of products. Although the share of agricultural
production in total output has declined in recent years, agriculture con-
tinues to be the main source of economic expansion, and is responsible for
about 45-50 percent of employment and almost 70 percent of export earnings.
The country is divided into three distinct agricultural zones: The Pacific
Zone, where about 60 percent of the nation's 2 million population lives,
is marked by a dual structure of farming -- a large number of small farms
grow basic grains with conventional technology, and a few large farms
specialize in cotton and sugarcane using modern technology; the mountainous
Central District is devoted mainly to coffee and livestock; and the large
Atlantic Plain holds a largely unutilized potential for forestry and live-
stock production.
4.        Nicaragua's economic growth prior to the 1972 earthquake was im-
pressive, although it was characterized by sharp cyclical changes. Real income
grew at an average annual rate of 6.4 percent (3.5 percent per capita) during
the 1946-1972 period. The strong upward trend in income resulted from the
expansion of production for exports, primarily of cotton, coffee, and beef,
but also of simple manufactured goods. The substantial growth of the economy,
however, did not mitigate the highly skewed distribution of wealth and income.
Moreover, the rural sector is characterized by a dualistic structure of
agricultural production and the related, highly concentrated pattern of land
ownership. The poorest one-third of the rural population, for example, holds
only about 3.5 percent of the country's arable land.



- 2 -
5.        Progress in reducing disparities in income and consumption has been
delayed by the persistently low level of public expenditures. The slow growth
of current expenditures -- and a consequent shortage of important public
service facilities such as education and health -- largely reflects budgetary
stringency dictated by insufficient revenues. Outside the field of transport
and electricity, the process of project identification and preparation has
been very limited in the past. As discussed below, however, progress
has been made in both fiscal performance and project preparation in the
last three years.
6.        The earthquake which struck Managua on December 23, 1972 took a toll
of about 10,000 lives, and destroyed or rendered unusable practically all
the central zone of the city, including most government offices, hospitals
and schools, the financial and commercial buildings and perhaps 2,500 shops
engaged in small-scale manufacturing and retail trade. About 32,000 housing
units, or about 45 percent of the housing in the Managua area, were destroyed.
The impact of the earthquake on productive capacity, however, was considerably
lower than initially feared, and the economy has recovered at a much faster
pace than originally estimated. Growth in GDP was 4.2 percent in real terms
in 1973 and reached 13 percent in 1974. The impressive growth of the latter
year was mainly attributable to construction activity in lManagua. Unemployment,
which had increased very steeply in 1973, moved down to pre-earthquake levels
of about 6 percent in 1974. However, as a result of slackening reconstruction
activity, compounded by a weak external demand for some of Nicaragua's indus-
trial exports, 1/ GDP grew by less than 2 percent in 1975. During 1976,
improved world market conditions for Nicaraguan exports gave new impetus to
economic expansion and GDP is estimated to have grown by over 6 percent during
the year and by a somewhat higher rate in 1977. As far as the accomplishment
of physical reconstruction is concerned, most public service facilities were
back to, or exceeded, preearthquake levels by 1975, but much remains to be
done to rebuild housing and commercial outlets for the poorer segments of the
population.
7.        The emergency taxes introduced after the earthquake reflected a
major fiscal effort which resulted in the increase of the tax ratio to GDP
from 8.9 percent prior to the earthquake to almost 11 percent in 1973-74.
While new permanent taxes were approved in late 1974 to replace the emergency
measures, the yield of the new taxes has fallen short of expectations, and
the tax ratio has declined slightly. The authorities are currently studying
a new program to increase fiscal revenues. These increased domestic revenues
are urgently required to finance the completion of reconstruction and the
projected levels of investment in the Government's development program.
8.        Some progress in overall planning and project preparation has taken
place in recent years. The public investment plan prepared by the Government
1/   E.g. exports of metal manufactures and chemical products, which together
accounted for 38 percent of manufactured exports in 1974, declined in
real terms by 13 percent and in nominal terms by almost 18 percent in
1975.



- 3 -
for 1975-79 assigns priority to expanding agricultural production and improv-
ing heaith, education and housing facilities for the rural poor. While a major
effort is still required to improve project preparation in the fields of rural
and social development, several projects have been developed recently or are
in preparation in these fields; for example, in addition to the Bank's second
education project (Loan 1244, signed on June 15, 1976), the IDB recently
approved a loan for rural electrification. Also, the Government is proceeding
with the reorganization of public sector agricultural institutions with finan-
cial and technical assistance from USAID. The main focus is on the implementa-
tion of an integrated rural development program -- INVIERNO -- which is
supplying credit and technical assistance to low income producers in the
Central Pacific and Central Interior regions and is also coordinating public
activities in education, health, housing and infrastructure for the same
target groups. The INVIERNO program became operational in 1976 and has so far
provided credit and technical assistance to over 5,000 rural families.
9.        In the years following the earthquake, cotton, coffee and beef have
continued to be the leading traditional exports and constituted on the average
29 percent, 13 percent and 9 percent respectively of total merchandise exports
over the period 1973-75. Relatively simple manufactured exports (e.g. tex-
tiles, animal feed, chemical and wood products) have been rising rapidly and
already represent over one-third of total exports. While imports averaged
less than 30 percent of GDP until 1972, the post-earthquake reconstruction
process, rapid credit expansion and higher import prices drove this figure up
to 45 percent in 1974. The value of imports increased by almost 150 percent
from 1972 to 1974, while earnings from exports increased by less than 60
percent; the resource balance changed from a surplus of US$23.0 million to a
deficit of US$200.0 million. This deficit was covered by heavy borrowing
during the period (much of it on commercial terms) and international reserves
remained unchanged. The balance of payments situation improved substantially
in 1975 when, largely as a result of slackening economic activity, imports
declined by 10 percent, while export proceeds remained virtually unchanged.
The resource gap declined from 14 percent of GDP in 1974 to 9 percent in 1975.
1/ A further improvement took place in 1976 and 1977 when the unusually
favorable prices for exports of coffee and cotton reduced the gap to substan-
tially lower levels.
10.       Since the earthquake, Nicaragua's external public debt outstanding
and disbursed has increased rapidly -- from about one-fourth of GDP in 1972 to
over one-third in 1975. The average terms of the debt have hardened consider-
ably because of heavy borrowing from private commercial sources. In the imme-
diate future, because of high coffee prices, this may not result in too high
a debt service ratio (the ratio for 1976 is estimated at 12.6 percent).
However, as coffee and cotton prices decline from their present unusually high
levels, the debt service ratio will tend to increase. However, if the country
successfully undertakes a serious effort to further expand and diversify exports
while keeping to a minimum additional external borrowing on commercial terms,
the debt service ratio should not exceed 17 percent during the remainder of
the decade.

11.       The overall prospects for the country's future economic expansion
will thus depend heavily on movements in international prices of its major
exports (cotton, beef and coffee) and imports (especially petroleum and
fertilizers), as well as on the success of policies in the following fields:
(a) export diversification, which is most likely to be achieved through the
promotion of resource-based exports such as wood products, fruits and vegetables;
(b) substitution of imports such as corn and some processed food products which
could be produced efficiently in the country; (c) holding overall imports down
to a reasonable level through appropriate domestic credit management; and
(d) restraining external borrowing on hard terms. If these policies are
implemented, the Nicaraguan economy may be expected to continue to grow at a
satisfactory pace.
External Finance
12.       External official finance is provided principally by the IDB, USAID,
the Bank, and CABEI. Recently, the Venezuelan Investment Fund (VIF) has begun
providing assistance to Nicaragua through a US$16.1 million equivalent loan
for electric power. USAID has made loans for agriculture, highways, industry,
rural electrification, housing, education and health. In agriculture, it has
played an important promotional role in developing the INVIERNO program to
assist rural development in some of the more depressed areas of the country.
CABEI is financing projects with regional impact, principally in transportation,
industry and power. In addition, CABEI has lent for housing and in lesser
amounts for education and agriculture. IDB is financing agriculture, water
supply and sewerage, industry, housing, transportation and higher education.
The lending of the principal external lending agencies from 1950 through 1976
is summarized below:

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       To date, Nicaragua has received 22 Bank loans and two IDA credits,
totalling US$171.9 million. As of September 30, 1977 a total of US$43.6 million
remained to be disbursed on six loans for education, power, agriculture and
ports, and on the 1973 Earthquake Reconstruction Credit. The most recent
operation was a loan for the equivalent of US$22.0 million for the Ninth Power
Project, signed April 22, 1977. In general, progress on most of these projects
has been satisfactory, although cost overruns in the past three and one-half
years have hampered execution of several projects, particularly ports and
electric power. With respect to the Earthquake Reconstruction Project: the
power and water supply components were implemented without significant prob-
lems; a portion of the education component and the sites and services component
were delayed initially, largely because of difficulties in acquiring sites,
but are now nearing completion; and the industrial component suffered initial
delays in the submission of acceptable projects by sub-borrowers, but has now
been completely disbursed. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits, and IFC investments as of September 30, 1977, as well as
notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
14.       In the past, Bank Group lending was heavily weighted towards
assisting Nicaragua develop basic infrastructure, through loans for electric
power, ports and highways. More recently, an increasing share of Bank lending
has been directed towards agriculture, water supply, education and earthquake
reconstruction. The Bank's current lending program is designed to respond to
Nicaragua's development requirements in several different ways. Given the
importance of efforts to strengthen the balance of payments, one objective
is to support Government programs for export diversification through loans
for agriculture and industrial credit; another is to help reduce the country's
dependence on imported fuel, possibly through a project for the development of
Nicaragua's geothermal energy resources. Another major objective is assisting
the Government to improve productivity and living conditions in the rural
sector, which would be supported by this proposed Rural Sanitation Project and
by rural development projects designed to complement activities in progress
under the INVIERNO program. In this connection, the Bank has agreed to send
an FAO/CP mission to help identify and prepare a project for the first stage
of a program for the development of the Atlantic frontier; the program will
include feeder roads, land distribution, credit and technical assistance as
well as necessary social infrastructure. The Bank also intends to assist the
Government in improving living conditions in urban centers through a sites and
services, urban upgrading and small business credit project, as well as
through the proposed Managua Water Supply III Project (which would satisfy the
city's water needs through 1985) being presented separately to the Executive
Directors.
15.       The Bank's share of total external public debt disbursed and out-
standing is likely to remain at about 10 percent on the average through 1981.
The Bank and IDA's share of debt service in 1974 was about 11 percent; it is



- 6 -
projected to decline during the remainder of the decade because of Nicaragua's
substantial increase in relatively hard-term commercial borrowing in the past
few years.
16.       In FY 1968, IFC made a loan and equity investment totalling US$2.1
million equivalent to help establish a new cotton and synthetic fiber textile
company (FABRITEX). IFC's equity has since been sold to local investors.
FABRITEX was hampered in its early years by marketing problems associated with
the difficulties experienced by the Central American Common Market, further
aggravated by the 1972 earthquake in Managua. The company has now reorganized
its operations and financial structure. In FY76, IFC made a loan of US$6.5
million to Nicaragua Sugar Estates Limited to help expand its sugar production
capacity, and a loan and equity investment totalling US$900,000 equivalent to
help finance construction and equipment of the Camino Real Hotel in Managua.
PART III - THE SECTOR
Sector Background
17.       The improvement of Nicaragua's water supply system during the 1960s
contributed substantially to bettering health conditions in the country, but
serious problems still exist as evidenced by a high infant mortality rate
(146 per thousand births), high percentage of deaths among young children
caused by enteritis and other diarrheal diseases (37 percent) and low life
expectancy (52 years) relative to other Latin American countries. Contami-
nation in Nicaragua is not effectively regulated or controlled. By 1975,
about 100 percent of Nicaragua's urban and 14 percent of its rural population
had access to potable water. Of the urban population, 72 percent had house
connections for water and 38 percent for sewerage; another 38 percent were
served by latrines. Of the rural population, only 24 percent had access to
latrines. Although the availability of water and sewerage services in urban
areas ranks average in comparison to other Latin American countries, services
in rural areas are among the lowest, with only five countries in the
Hemisphere having inferior service levels.
Sector Organization
18.       Public water and sewerage services in Nicaragua are provided by
Empresa Aguadora de Managua (EAMI), Departamento Nacional de Agua Potable y
Alcantarillado (DENACAL) and the Ministry of Public Health (1IOH). Four
municipalities and some large industrial users have their own water sources.
19.       EAM has been a Government-owned utility since 1932 and is the
capital city's main supplier of potable water. In 1976, it was serving
435,000 persons (90 percent of the city's population) with house connections;
almost all others had access to community standpipe services. DENACAL is a



- 7 -
national agency, dependent on MOH, that operates sewerage systems in all
urban areas as well as all urban water systems throughout the country, except
in Managua and the four municipalities which have their own systems. In 1976,
it served 62,000 water and 48,000 sewer house connections, reaching 320,000
and 390,000 inhabitants respectively.
20.       MOH has responsibility for rural water supply and excreta disposal.
To develop these services, it created a new unit in 1976 called PLANSAR
responsible for planning and constructing rural sanitation systems. PLANSAR
is divided into planning and executing branches and is one of three sections
in the Ministry's Rural Health Department. The other two sections are the
Administration section, which is in charge of all procurement and general
services for the Rural Health Program, and the Human Resources section, which
trains the paramedical personnel required for rural areas.   PLANSAR has
initiated and is satisfactorily executing a program, financed with the assis-
tance of a 1976 AID loan, to train personnel for rural health, improve rural
health care and provide water and excreta disposal services for 300 rural
communities. PLANSAR is also the proposed executing agency for the Bank's
Rural Sanitation Project, which will extend its coverage to over 500 additional
communities. The Bank and AID projects together would bring the PLANSAR
program to all provinces of Nicaragua except for largely inaccessible areas in
the sparsely populated eastern province of Zelaya. As part of this Bank
project, PLANSAR's staff will be increased to assure its ability to execute
effectively both projects.
Sector Development
21.       Investment for water and sewerage during the last six years (1971-76)
reached US$38.2 million, or 7.8 percent of public fixed investment, with 95 per-
cent of this investment being concentrated in urban areas. The Government now
plans to extend, improve and integrate services and give greater emphasis to
rural areas. Its target for 1981 is to serve 80 percent of the urban population
by water house connections and 70 percent with sewerage connections, and in
the rural areas, to serve 40 percent of the population with safe water and to
provide 48 percent with latrines. In rural areas, the Government is aiming at
integrated development, including education, sanitation and house improvements.
These efforts are expected to increase life expectancy, reduce child malnutri-
tion, increase productivity of the rural population, improve environmental and
healthlconditions and help slow migration to urban areas. This program
represents a key element in the Government's overall effort to improve rural
living conditions and should complement other programs, like INVIERNO, being
undertaken in the rural areas.
22.       External assistance has financed over half (53 percent) of urban
and rural water/sewerage investment over the past five years. The IDB, AID
and World Bank/IDA have supplied major aid for urban areas, while CARE has
been a source of assistance for small rural communities, working with DENACAL
to develop water supply for several towns below 3,000 inhabitants. AID,



-8-
through the loan mentioned above, is also financing rural sanitation efforts.
In order for the Government to continue its program in the sector and achieve
its targets for the country by 1981, it is estimated that public investment in
the sector would have to grow on average at about 10 percent per annum in real
terms. Certain measures are being undertaken to help ease the financial
burden of investment in this sector. In urban areas, the Government is
phasing out its program of giving foreign loans to DENACAL as grants for
construction works, and EAM is implementing tariff increases and structural
modifications. In rural areas, the Government is emphasizing the development
of simple designs and the participation of the community, in cash and labor,
which will bring costs for construction, operation and maintenance of the
systems to levels which will enable the country to readily duplicate the
program in the future in additional communities. The proposed Rural Sanitation
Project conforms to this goal and will provide facilities with the capacity to
serve a projected population of close to 250,000 in 1988 at about US$19 per
person. Both this project and the proposed Managua Water Supply III Project
would give strong impetus to the current Government policies of improving
sanitary conditions and living standards of the poor.
Prior Bank Projects
23.       Bank Group lending for water supply in Nicaragua has included one
loan, one IDA credit and a component of the 1973 Earthquake Reconstruction
Project, all for the Managua area.   The first operation in 1962 (First Managua
Water Supply Project, Credit 26-NI) for US$3 million helped finance a US$6
million water supply project, which was successfully completed in 1966. Under
this project, water supply capacity was expanded to allow an eventual increase
in the number of house connections from 15,300 to 39,200 by 1972. The second
operation in March 1972 (Managua Water Supply Project II, Loan 808-NI) for
US$6.9 million helped finance a US$10.0 million project designed to develop
and expand EAM's water sources, transmission and distribution facilities. EAM
was in the early stages of this project when the earthquake struck, and the
project was subsequently modified to meet the new conditions in the service
area resulting from the shift of a substantial part of the population from
downtown to suburban areas. The deletion of a few project elements, which
were no longer of high priority due to the changed circumstances, freed an
estimated US$850,000 of loan funds to be used to finance loan interest and
commitment charges. Also, the closing and maturity dates were extended by one
year, and the rate of return requirement waived through 1976 (Board presenta-
tion R73-67, dated April 10, 1973). In addition, to provide resources needed
to reconstruct water works and extend services to new areas populated after
the earthquake, a US$2.5 million component was included in the Earthquake
Reconstruction Project (Credit 389-NI) of June 6, 1973. This component
financed US$1.0 million of civil works, equipment and supplies for repair and
rehabilitation, and US$1.5 million to cover the higher prices of civil works
being performed under Loan 808. Both the Second Managua Water Supply Project
and the water supply component of the Earthquake Reconstruction Project have
been completed.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report of Rural Sanitation
Project, Nicaragua" (No. 1753-NI dated November 9, 1977) is being distributed
separately. This project has been under preparation for two years with PAHO's
assistance, and was appraised in March/April 1977. Negotiations were held in
Washington on October 20-21, 1977. The Government of Nicaragua was represented
by Mr. Jose Maria Zuniga, Director of PLANSAR.
Description of the Project
25.       The proposed loan represents the first Bank involvament in a project
designed to provide basic sanitation and health-related services exclusively
to the lowest income rural population, living in dispersed areas (maximum
population of 800 and median population of only 75). It supports an integrated
program of water supply, latrines, sanitary house improvements, health educa-
tion and child immunization, and will reach rural communities in 3 of the
country's 8 regions (Regions I, III and VI). About 172,000 people would be
reached by the project initially, and it is estimated that by 1988 the popula-
tion served would have grown to about 250,000 people, or 41 percent of the
rural population in these areas. The target group is among the poorest in
Nicaragua, with annual per capita incomes below US$150 (i.e., below one-fourth
of the national average). The project would also strengthen the managerial
and operational capabilities of PLANSAR, the executing agency for the Ministry
of Health. The specific project components are as follows:
(a) Construction of basic water supply systems in approximately
550 villages. The investments chosen for each community
will be the least-cost solutions and are estimated, subject
to the technical solution chosen for each village selected,
to include 135 drilled wells, 300 dug wells, 300 improved
wells and 77 aqueducts of varying levels.
(b)  Provision of sanitary excreta disposal through improvement,
rehabilitation and addition of over 26,000 latrines.
(c) Improvement of sanitary conditions (trash disposal, floor
leveling, mosquito prevention, crack and roof repair, inside
partitions, eventual water hook-up, etc.) in about 26,000
houses in project villages (to be financed entirely by the
Government).
(d) Vaccines to immunize about 72,000 children, five years of
age and younger, in project villages against measles, polio
and other diseases (to be financed entirely by the Government).
(e) Equipment to be used by PLANSAR in executing the project,
mainly office and communications equipment, jeeps and
trucks.



- 10 -
(f) Project Technical Advisor to assist PLANSAR in bid prepara-
tion, tender analysis, implementation of low-cost technical
solutions, promotion of community organization, assurance of
adherence to eligibility and design criteria and administra-
tion of procurement and supply; consultants to make recommen-
dations on project cost control, programming and construction
supervision.
(g)  Additional PLANSAR personnel to provide health education and
promote community organization.
(h) Additional PLANSAR administrative and engineering personnel
to plan technical solutions, direct community construction
works, procure the required materials and equipment and
train the community to maintain its own systems (to be
financed entirely by the Government).
26.       Given the large number (over 2,000) of villages in the regions to be
served by the project, a set of criteria have been established for selecting
the estimated 550 rural villages included in the proposed project. These
criteria are: population size between 50 and 800 inhabitants in 1978;
access to roads (at least part of the year); willingness to provide labor,
cash or materials to cover at least 15 percent of project costs; and an
estimated least-cost water supply solution of less than US$25 per capita (1977
dollars). Standpipes and hand-pumps will be used whenever possible, and
mechanized systems (wind or eventually electricity) only when no other solu-
tion is feasible. Agreement has been reached on these eligibility and design
criteria, which are similar to those being used under the AID project (Loan
Agreement, Sections 1.02(a) and 3.01(b)(iii) and Schedules 1, 2 and 5).
Cost and Financing
27.       The total project cost is estimated at US$6.3 million, including
US$2.0 million for price and physical contingencies. Base costs have been
estimated at January 1977 prices, to which yearly allowances for price
increases have been added as follows: for foreign costs, 7.5 percent up to
1979 and 7 percent thereafter; for local costs, 12 percent in 1977, 9 percent
in 1978 and 7.5 percent thereafter. Physical contingencies have been calculated
at 30 percent for drilled wells, 5 percent for engineering and administration
and 10 percent for all other items. The average cost of consultant assistance
(48 man/months for the Project Technical Advisor and 10 man/months for other
consultants) would be US$3,400 per man/month (January 1977 prices). This
relatively low cost figure is attributable to the simplicity of the tasks to
be carried out and the use of direct hiring of individual consultants.
28.       The proposed loan of US$3.0 million would finance the foreign
exchange cost of the project (US$2.3 million) and about US$0.7 million (18
percent) of local costs. The proposed local cost financing is justified to
assure a reasonable Bank participation in a project which has a low foreign
cost component, and which represents a key initiative to improve living con-
ditions for families within the lowest income groups in Nicaragua. Government



- 11 -
budgetary allocations would finance a total of US$1.9 million (30 percent)
over the four-year period of the project. The communities would make a cash
or labor contribution of US$1.4 million (22 percent). Although the minimum
community participation has been fixed at 15 percent of project cost, based on
experience so far with the AID project and mission estimates of the participa-
tion needed for the different types of project works proposed, the average
contribution is likely to be 22 percent. (Details of project costs and of the
financing plan are presented in the Loan and Project Summary at the beginning
of this report.)
Project Execution
29.       The project will be executed by PLANSAR, with work beginning in
Region VI in January 1978, in Region III in January 1979 and in Region I in
January 1980 (after work in Region VI is finished). The experiences and
results obtained under this project and under the previously mentioned AID
project will be exchanged within PLANSAR to achieve coordination of these
programs.  In order for PLANSAR to execute both projects, it is estimated that
its one existing Regional Unit (being used for the AID project) would have to
be supplemented by two new Units, one immediately and a second in 1979, with
professional staff composed largely of educators and engineers. Training of
additional educators, most of whom are expected to be women, for these new
Units has already begun under the AID project, and it has been agreed that as
a condition of effectiveness, the Nicaraguan Government will adequately staff
a new Regional Unit, requiring about 44 employees, including 21 professionals.
It has also been agreed that a second Unit would be staffed no later than
January 1, 1979 or on such other date agreed by the Bank and the Government
(Loan Agreement, Sections 6.01(b) and 3.01(b)). Although PLANSAR's management
is adequate and there is a PAHO engineer providing technical advice to the AID-
financed project, Nicaragua's short experience in rural sanitation makes the
presence of a Project Technical Advisor critical to the proper execution of the
Bank-financed project. The selection of this Advisor, with qualifications and
under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, will therefore also be a
condition of loan effectiveness (Loan Agreement, Sections 3.03 and 6.01(a)).
Likewise, assurances have been obtained that technical assistance consultants
acceptable to the Bank to make recommendations on PLANSAR's project cost
control, programming and construction supervision will be appointed not later
than March 1, 1978 (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03).
30.       Implementation arrangements for the project, the majority of which
are already beginning to be applied under the AID project, would be as follows.
Each Regional Unit would establish operational centers in two or three villages
within a Region to serve the rural population within a 50-100 kilometer radius.
A PLANSAR educator would visit each village to instruct its population on
basic health problems and organize a Health Committee (HC). The PLANSAR
educator and HC would then evaluate health problems and develop possible
solutions. The educator would also assess the community's willingness
and ability to participate in the project. Upon receipt of a favorable report
from the educator, PLANSAR would send an engineer to carry out a study of the
least-cost solution for water supply and waste disposal. The community would



- 12 -
then present to PLANSAR a written request for assistance, prepared with the
help of the PLANSAR educator, and describing the work to be done, implementa-
tion schedule and the community contribution. A typical project would include:
water supply (usually by hand pumps), latrines, child immunization, and home
improvements (appropriate waste disposal, drainage for mosquito control, roof,
floor and wall improvements and water hook-up in rural towns where a water
distribution system would be installed).
31.       After review and approval by the Project Technical Advisor, and
further approval by PLANSAR's Director, this request would form the basis of a
contract, whose basic format will be approved by the Bank as a condition of
effectiveness (Loan Agreement, Section 6.01(c)). This contract, to be signed
between the Government (PLANSAR) and, on behalf of the community, the corre-
sponding municipality or an association of members of such community (usually
a cooperative), would describe the works to be performed and the respective
contributions and responsibilities. The contract would provide that each
community would own, operate and maintain its system, with MOH responsible for
supervision and assistance in operation and maintenance. In order to assure
the timely execution of these contracts, it will also be a condition of
effectiveness that the Government will have confirmed, with evidence satis-
factory to the Bank, that existing legislation for cooperatives and municipali-
ties is adequate to allow local organizations to legally sign such contracts
on behalf of the communities involved (Loan Agreement, Section 6.01(d)). The
Government has agreed to take all necessary steps for the expeditious granting
of legal status to each cooperative formed for this project (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.02(d)). The Government has also indicated that it expects these
cooperatives to be used in the future to organize communities for other
programs--such as nutrition, family planning and education--which would form
part of integrated rural development.
32.       PLANSAR engineers would direct the community works or, in the case
of drilled wells and some aqueducts, request bids for the necessary civil
works. The Regional Unit would order necessary materials and equipment from
a Central Office, which would handle all procurement. The Central Office
would fill the order from materials and equipment stored centrally and pro-
cured in suitable quantities in advance on the basis of estimated requirements
supplied by the regions. The Planning Department would coordinate work in
different regions for both the AID and Bank projects, control project costs,
produce educational aids and perform all general planning. During project
execution, PLANSAR educators would train leaders to provide the continuing
education and direction required to maintain the improved public health
conditions and teach one or two persons in each participating village the
required skills to operate and maintain the water system. After completion
of project works, they will be turned over to the community free of charge.
Operation and maintenance would be a community responsibility (under the
supervision of MOH). The cost of this should be readily manageable, as most
systems would be hand-operated and administered by the community, and cash
outlays would, therefore, be very small (estimated from about US$.14 to US$.57
per capita per year, depending on the type of water system installed). To
assure effective project administration and monitoring, it has been agreed



- 13 -
that the accounting and procurement units of the Rural Health Department's
Administration, which are adequate for current programs, will be reinforced
as and when needed to support project activities (Loan Agreement, Section
3.01(b)(i)), and that quarterly reports will be submitted to the Bank on
specified monitoring indicators acceptable to the Bank (such as number and
percentage of villages served, percentage of community contribution, number of
wells and latrines, etc.), to be established no later than March 31, 1978
(Loan Agreement, Section 3.07).
Procurement and Disbursement
33.       All contracts for materials or equipment with an estimated cost of
US$20,000 or more, or civil works contracts with an estimated cost of
US$100,000 or more, would be awarded through international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Contracts for lower amounts may be
awarded on the basis of competitive bidding in accordance with local pro-
curement procedures acceptable to the Bank, provided however that the aggre-
gate costs of these contracts for materials, equipment and civil works do
not exceed US$500,000. Suppliers from the Central American Common Market, in-
cluding those in Nicaragua, will be allowed a preference of either 15 percent
of the CIF price, or 50 percent of the import duties applicable to suppliers
from non-member countries, whichever is lower. It is expected that most
civil works contracts would be won by Nicaraguan firms, and most of the
equipment and material supply contracts would be won by foreign firms. A
schedule of the villages to be served during each calendar year and a proposed
procurement program covering the items estimated to be required for these
villages will be presented by the Director of PLANSAR to the Bank before bids
are invited. Disbursements would be made only for expenditures included in the
approved procurement program (Loan Agreement, Section 3.06 and Schedule 1,
paragraph 4(b)).
34.       The loan would be disbursed over a period of four years to meet:
(a) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 80 percent of local expenditures
for water supply (wells, distribution and transmission lines and reservoirs);
(b) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 80 percent of local expenditures
for the latrine program; (c) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for equipment
and vehicles; (d) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for the Project Technical
Advisor and technical consultants; and (e) 50 percent of total expenditures
for salaries of PLANSAR personnel to be hired for the project for health
education and community organization. The closing date is expected to be June
30, 1982.
Project Risks
35.       The short experience of PLANSAR in project implementation represents
a possible source of delay. However, the proposed projects for rural communi-
ties are simple and repetitive, and the AID program is being executed well ahead
of schedule with enthusiastic community participation, so no major problems
are expected. In addition, the Bank project includes a substantial technical
assistance component to PLANSAR to help assure effective project execution.



- 14 -
Another potential risk is the project's heavy dependence on community partici-
pation in maintenance of the systems, but the continuous supervision and
support to be provided by MOH, the simplicity of the systems and the minimum
maintenance needs of the works should ensure that the risks are no greater
than those that could normally be expected with water supply and sewerage
projects.
Environmental Effects
36.       No adverse environmental effects can be expected from the project.
On the contrary, contamination levels would be reduced as a result of the
latrinization program.
Justification
37.       A quantitative measure of economic benefits for this project is not
possible, not only because of the scarcity of data, but also because the
project is designed to provide an integrated approach to basic sanitation and
health, including many dissimilar components (water supply, latrines, garbage
disposal, house improvements, immunization, etc.). A considerable part of
the project cost (20 percent) is dedicated to expenses for community organiza-
tion and basic health education, which should not only result in better health,
but also contribute to the overall economic welfare of the population. Al-
though these economic benefits are difficult to measure in monetary units, it
is clear that the project will contribute significantly to supporting Govern-
ment efforts to improve living conditions in Nicaragua s rural population.
The primary benefit of improved health and welfare will be reflected in greater
access to safe water, increased effective nutrition, increased life expectancy,
reduced mortality rates for infants and young children, and increased work
productivity. The beneficiaries' willingness to pay for these perceived
benefits will be demonstrated by their contribution of at least 15 percent of
project costs and all operating and maintenance expenses.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Nicaragua and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank, and the text of the Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The draft Loan Agreement conforms to the normal pattern of loans
for water supply and sewerage projects and its more important features have
been included in Part IV and summarized in Annex III of this report. There
are four special conditions of effectiveness of the Loan Agreement: (i) that
the Borrower will have engaged a Project Technical Advisor acceptable to the
Bank; (ii) that it will have adequately staffed a new PLANSAR Regional Unit to
initiate project execution; (iii) that it will have submitted for Bank review
an appropriate model form for contracts to be signed between it and the
participating villages; and (iv) that it will have confirmed, with evidence



- 15 -
satisfactory to the Bank, that existing legislation for cooperatives and
municipalities is adequate to allow local organizations to legally sign such
contracts on behalf of the community.
39.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMIENDATION
40.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Ln. 532   Education Project; US$4.0 million of April 10, 1968; Effective Date:
June 25, 1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
This project is supporting government efforts to improve and expand
secondary education in major cities and upgrade primary teacher training.
Despite delays in implementation, related primarily to the 1972 earthquake in
Managua and some administrative problems, 19 of the 20 project schools are now
in operation and the remaining one will be completed by the end of 1977.
Ln. 840   Eighth Power Project; US$24.0 million of June 28, 1972; Effective
Date: March 30, 1973; Closing Date: December 30, 1977.
The two main works of the project -- the steam power plant with
associated transmission lines, and the interconnection with Honduras--were
delayed about 14 months on average for several reasons: the need to make
repairs and install emergency facilities for power after the earthquake, late
deliveries of equipment by suppliers, and late loan effectiveness because of
delay in signing the interconnection contract with Honduras. The interconnec-
tion was placed in service in October 1976, and the project originally
appraised to cost US$34.7 million equivalent is now expected to be completed
in 1978, with a substantial cost overrun amounting to US$24.3 milion. ENALUF
raised tariffs 30 percent on average in February, 1975, in addition to a fuel
surcharge of about 50 percent which went into effect in late 1974. The



ANNEX II
Page 3 of 4
Venezuelan Investment Fund has approved a US$16.1 million loan to assist
ENALUF in covering the financing requirements arising from the cost overrun.
An extension of the closing date by about one year will be required.
Ln. 943   Agricultural Credit Project; US$8.5 million of November 16, 1973;
Effective Date: April 10, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
After an initial delay in loan effectiveness caused by (1) addi-
tional time required for the Borrower to sign a subsidiary loan agreement with
the first participating bank, and (2) difficulties in hiring a project director,
the rate of sub-loan approvals by the Project Unit and the participating
banks is satisfactory. However, considerable cost increases are expected
to reduce the number of sub-loans to be made under the project to below
appraisal estimates.
Cr. 389,  Earthquake Reconstruction Project; US$20.0 million of June 6, 1973;
Effective Date: August 7, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
With the help of the US$5.0 million power component, the National
Power Company (ENALUF) has completed repairs to its damaged equipment and
is providing service to people displaced by the earthquake. The Water Supply
Company of Managua (EAM), assisted by the US$2.5 million water supply com-
ponent, has repaired all its storage reservoirs and all its main distri-
bution system. Production and distribution of water is back to normal.
No serious delays in project execution or cost overruns were experienced for
the power and water supply components. As for the US$2.0 million education
component, the four prefabricated schools built under Part I of this component
are in full operation. The multilateral secondary school and the technical
institute to be built under Part II are under construction. Because of
difficulties in acquiring sites, the construction of these two institutions
is expected to be completed by December 1977, one year behind schedule.
Project execution on the US$8.0 million sites and services component is
proceeding satisfactorily. The Managua I and II, the Masaya, Granada, Leon,
and Jinotepe projects have been completed. The remaining project is Managua
III where dwelling and sanitary cores are expected to be completed by December
1977. Design standards have been reduced for many of the sites in an effort
to offset the cost escalation which has taken place during the last two
years; however, the total number of serviced lots still has had to be reduced
from the originally planned 5,500, to a total of 4,453 units at present.
After some initial delays in the submission of acceptable sub-projects by
the implementing agency, the industrial financing component is fully disbursed.
An extension of the closing date may be required for complete disbursement of
project funds.

Ln. 879   Second Port of Corinto Project; US$11.0 million of February 2, 1973
and US$5.0 million Supplementary Loan of August 1, 1975; Effective
Date: March 23, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The project initially encountered substantial cost overruns pri-
marily due to world and domestic inflation and earthquake-related delays in
project execution. In order to help finance these overruns the Government
obtained supplementary financing from the Central American Bank for Economic
Integration and the World Bank. Progress on the project is now good. Of the
project components still in execution, the containers' wharf is nearly com-
pleted and should shortly become operational for general cargo shipments,
and the administration building will be ready by the end of the year. No
action has been taken, however, by the Government to improve the access road
to the port, and the Bank has expressed its concern about this delay. The
Government has already paid C$11 million of its overdue contribution to the
equity of the Port Authority, and has agreed to pay a total of C$35 million
by the end of the year.
Ln. 1244 Second Education Project; US$11.0 million of June 15, 1976;
Effective Date: August 17, 1976; Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
Project implementation is progressing satisfactorily. Architec-
tural designs, selection of construction firms, in-service teacher training
courses and selection of an agency to manage the technical assistance compo-
nent of the project are proceeding in accordance with the appraisal schedule.
Ln. 1402 Ninth Power Project; US$22.0 million of April 22, 1977;
Effective Date: October 27, 1977; Closing Date: March 31, 1981.
This project has just become effective.
