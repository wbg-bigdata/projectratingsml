INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO JAMAICA FOR AN AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT PROJET
1.        I submit the following report and recommendatian on a proposed
loan to Jamaica for the equivalent of US$12.5 million to help finance an
airport development project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, in-
cluding four years of grace, with interest at 8% per annum. US$11.3 mil-
lion of the proceeds of the loan would be relent on the same terms to the
Airports Authority of JaMaica (AAJ).  A Project Agreement would be signed
between the Bank and the AAJ.
PART I  - THE ECONOMY
2.        Economic Report (No. 257a-JM) entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Jamaica" was distributed to the Executive Directors on
March 12, 1974. Country data sheets am attached as Annex I to this report.
3.        During the decade 1962-72 the economy expanded rapidly with the
annual rate of growth accelerating from about 4.5% to about 5.5%. At the
same time the economy experienced major structural changes. Mining, alumina
production and tourism, all supported by large private capital inflows,
expanded, while agriculture stagnated and agricultural exports, notably of
sugar, declined. This shift in the production pattern was accompanied by
rapid urbanization, and by the emergence of severe and persistent unemploy-
ment and of sharp disparities in income distribution. Large-scale emigration
during the decade resulted in the loss of significant numbers of skilled and
semi-skilled workers; the consequent shortage of technically qualified
personnel has been aggravated by deficiencies in the academically oriented
educational system.
4.        As a result of its limited resource endow-ment and the small size
of its domestic market, Jamaica has a very open economy heavily dependent
on the external sector. Until 1972 a widening current account deficit in
the balance of payments had been offset by substantial private capital in-
flows for expansion of the bauxite/alumina industry. These inflows fell
off sharply in 1972 with the completion of major investments in alumina
capacity. Partly as a consequence, but also due to some weakness in
monetary and fiscal programs, Jamaica for the first time since independence
experienced serious balance-of-payments difficulties. Corrective action
taken late in 1972 and early 1973, including devaluations, the imposition
of import restrictions and a tightening of credit policy, was successful
in temporarily reversing the reserves drain during the middle of 1973.
However, subsequently exchange reserves have fallen again and by the end
of 1973 were down to about one month's imports. The situation has been
aggravated by the tripling of petroleum prices at the end of 1973 which
will cost Jamaica about US$90 million extra in 1974, equivalent to about
13% of 1973 export earnings. To conserve foreign exchange reserves the



- 2 -
government in early 1974 took additional measures including an increase in
gasoline taxes, further restrictions on imports and credit availability and
an increase in interest rates.  Jamaica has recently obtained increases in the
prices of its sugar and banana exports to the United Kingdom and in M1y of
this year announced increases in taxes and royalties on the U.S. and Canadian-
owned bauxite companies, estimated to yield an additional $155 million in a full
year. The greatly increased revemnes in prospect from bauxite taxation would
provide substantial relief to Jamaica's balance of payments during the rest of
1974 and in ensuing years.   The larger revenues should offset the higher cost
of oil and other commodity imports and enable Jamaica during the next 2 to 3 years
to restore a reasonable level of foreign exchange reserves following their depletion
during 1973 and early 1974. The current account is still likely to remain in
deficit reaching on average over $200 million per annum through 1979, although to
offset this deficit substantial inflows of capital are in prospect (see paragraph 8).
5.        The government action to increase taxes and royalties followed the
failure to reach agreement with the companies on a renegotiation of the tax clauses
in the original company contracts.   The companies have objected to the tax increases
announced and indicated that they would take legal action; three US-owned corn-
panies have requested arbitration before the International Centre for Settlement
of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The requests for arbitration have been registered
by the Centre. The next step will be the constitution of arbitral tribunals. The
Convention creating the Centre establishes rules for the constitution of tribuhals,
including rules for the appointment by the Centre of arbitrators in case of failure
of the parties to act. * intend to follow developments in this matter closely.
In addition to the issue concerning the taxes and royalties, there are other out-
standing issues (such as land ownership, government participation in companies,
and guaranteed supply of bauxite for companies), on which the companies and the
gorernment are negotiating.
6.        Over the last 18 months or so there has been a sharp increase in
Jamaica's domestic price level which during 1973 increased by an average of
19% over the previous year. By April 1974 the consumer price index had
increased by about 29% over April 1973, owing in part to recent
increases in world prices and higher import prices resulting from devaluation.
However, under the pressure of active trade unions, wage settlements in recent
years have outstripped increases in productivity and have been particularly high
during the last few months, reaching 25% in the construction industry and even
higher levels in other sectors. The government is considering the adoption
of an incomes policy which would be related to increases in productivity and
which, if effective, would help Jamaica retain its international competiveness.
The government is keeping under review the level of interest rates, which have
become negative in real terms as a result of recent price inflation. Higher
interest rates would encourage savi.ngs, and help reduce the present
incentive to invest funds abroad rather than in Jamaica.
7.        kithout a sustained rate of economic growth of about 7% annually it
will be difficult for the country to achieve its principal objective of a signi-
ficant reduction in the high rate of unemployment, currently about 15%. The need
for increased job creation will become even more acute in the years ahead since
the growth rate in the total population of working age is expected to rise from 0.5%



to 3% during the period to 1980 due to falling emigration and an increase in
the birth rate in the 1950s. For the immediate future the potential for
increased growth and employment is encouraging. In agriculture, a compre-
hensive review of the sector has recently been undertaken with assistance
from the Bank. Government initiatives are already under way to rehabilitate
the important sugar industry; other government plans to revitalize the sector
include land-use reorganization to increase productivity and employment, and
measures to stimulate other export crops and domestic food production. In
the mining sector, bauxite and alumina output should increase substantially
as a result of recent investments. A substantial investment in an oi- refinery
is in prospect with the possibility of associated investments in petro-chemicals;
and in manufacturing, there is potential for increased contribution to export
growth. Further growth in tourism (the country's second largest foreign ex-
change earner) may also be expected after present uncertainties about the energy
situation have been resolved. However, the extent to which Jamaica's agri-
cultural and industrial growth potential can be realized will depend in large
part on how successful the government is in implementing policies to improve
Jamaica's competitive position.
8.       The increased rate of growth necessary to make a significant impact
on unemployment will require substantially higher inflows of private and
public capital than in the recent past. Such inflows are in prospect over
the next few years and given continued progress in public policies, it is
likely that they could be maintained for the rest of the decade. The source
and direction of commitments of external public loans (including government-
guaranteed loans) from 1965 to 1972,which have averaged over $hO million per
annum, are given in the table in Annex I. For the five-year period 1974-78,
public capital inflows, including guaranteed loans to the private sector, could
average nearly US$100 million a year. From existing indications, about 60%
will be raised from official sources - the Bank, IDB and bilateral aid sources -
while the remainder would consist of medium-term loans from suppliers and
financial institutions. Jamaica will also need to mobilize increased domestic
financial resources, both public and private. It will thus be necessary for
the government to take measures to restrain the growth of government current
expenditures and to achieve a further growth of revenue relative to GDP. A
recovery in private sector savings can be expected only if the government
maintains fiscal discipline and discourages consumption by the appropriate use
of monetary policy.
9.       Jamaica will need to take prompt and determined policy measures in the
critical areas of the economy outlined above, and discussed at greater length
in the Economic Report, to maintain economic stability and achieve a reasonable
rate of sustained economic growth. Assuming sound policies are pursued, public
debt service as a ratio of export earnings is projected to rise sharply from
nearly 5.0% in 1973 to a peak of 7.5% in 1976 and then to decline steadily to
about 4% by the end of the decade. Given that exports including non-factor
services accounted for over 4C% of Jamaica's GNP in 1972, the sharply increased
level of public debt service forecast for the next two years, largely on account
of heavy Euro-dollar borrowings in 1973/74, is high; however, it is not unmanage-
able, and we do not consider that it will give rise to problems of creditworthiness.
Although no special terms of Bank lending appear justified on country grounds,
the foreign exchange component of projects which the Bank may finance in sectors



-4-
such as agriculture, urban development and population, may be relatively
small; in order, therefore, to help achieve an adequate level of external
capital inflows some local currency financing would be justified in these
cases.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN JAMAICA
Introduction
10..      Since the country's independence in 1962, the Bank has made eleven
loLns to Jamaica totalling just over $100 million. Of this amount about half
has been for infrastructural investments in electric power, water supply and
highways; the remainder has gone into education, family planning, agricultural
creidit and a sites and services project. The proposed loan would be the first
for airports development. There have so far been only two IFC operations; a
loan in 1961 to a pre-mix concrete company, and an equity/loan investment in
1968 in a hotel project. Annex II contains a sumuary statement of Bank loans
and IFC investments as of June 30, 1974 together with notes on the execution
of ongoing projects. As noted in the Annex, the Bank is experiencing problems
in the exacution of some of its projects in Jamaica, and is in discussion with
the governmont and relevant agencies on measures to improve performance.
Future Direction of Bank Lending
11.       The case for continued Bank lending rests on the need to provide some
of Jamaica's external financing requirements and to support appropriate policies
in critical areas of the economy mentioned in Part I of this report. As in the
past, Bank lending will also be directed towards achieving improvements in infra-
structure, at contributing to the alleviation of the unemployment problem and to
assisting in the wider distribution of the benefits of growth. After a lull in
Bank lending 1972/73 - due largely to institutional constraints and slow project
preparation - the pace of B-nk operations has recently accelerated. The Bank's
share of external public debt is projected to increase from about 9% in 1974 to
a peak of about 23% in 1979. This sharp increase is also attributable to the
fact that a substantial part of the heavy Euro-dollar borrowings contracted by
Jamaica in 1972 and 1973 will have been repaid by end 1979.
12.       In  infrastructure, the Bank plans to continue to lend support to
high priority investments in the transportation sector which were identified
by a national transportation survey financed by CIDA and carried out in 1968/70.
In July of this year the Executive Directors approved a $13.5 million loan for
arterial road construction constituting the first phase of the government's
1974-79 arterial road investment program; it is expected that the government
will seek further Bank assistance for the second phase of the program to start
in about two years' time. The project now before you would help relieve con-
straints upon the future growth of international air traffic and provide a more
sound financial and institutional base for managing Jamaica's two international
airports.



13.       Other infrastructure investments being considered by the Bank
would have as a primary objective improving essential facilities for the
rapidly expanding Kingston Metropolitan Area (KMA), which itself accounts
for over one-quarter (about 550,000) of the total population of Jamaica
and a large proportion of its industry and comerce. A proposed sewerage
and water supply project would provide limited extension of Kingston's
sewerage system to meet its most urgent needs, and also additional water
so as to avoid shortages which would otherwise develop over the next three
to four years. The project would also include engineering studies and pre-
paratory work necessary for the next major water supply project for Bank
financing. More generally the proposed infrastructural investments would
help strengthen the institutions concerned.
14.       In the social areas, in addition to the recent sites and services
project, we propose to continue our association with the education sector with
a third education project. However, the scope of this project will not be
defined until the conclusions of a recent survey of the education sector,
undertaken by AID with Bank participation, have been discussed with the govern-
ment and more progress made in implementing the ongoing second project. Further
ahead, it is expected that a second family planning project, which might include
a nutrition component, would be considered.
15.       In the directly productive sectors, the Bank is already involved in
agriculture through a loan to the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) for on-lending
for agricultural credits and a second loan has recently been approved. At the
request of the government, the Bank assisted in the conduct of an agricultural
sector survey with a view to revitalizing this sector as a means of promoting
exports, stimulating import substitution and helping to check the population
drift from the rural to the urban areas. We expect to be able to assist the
government in implementing the program of action which is emerging from this
study, and will be placing increasing emphasis on agriculture in our future
lending to Jamaica. Detailed feasibility studies are already under way which
should result in a project for Bank financing to rehabilitate the important
sugar industry.  Looking further ahead, it is expected that the government
would wish the Bank to assist in the preparation and financing of a project
designed to ameliorate the situation of small farmers; the content and scope
of such a project have not yet been defined but may take the form of a rural
development project including components for improving land utilization and
crop production.
PART III - TRANSPORTATION IN JAMAICA
16.       Jamaica's transport system consists of about 9,500 miles of
arterial, secondary main and parish roads, a government-owned railroad of
about 180 miles, six airports, 13 seaports and 30 miles of private railway.
The basic system is generally adequate serving most of the population centers



- 6 -
and productive areas, although there is considerable need for expansion in
capacity and improvement in condition.   There is also scope for improving
transport planning and, following upon discussions with the Bank in the con-
text of the recently approved Bank-financed third highway project, the gov-
Ecrnment is now taking steps to strengthen its transport planning capability.
17.       Most of the internal transport needs are met by roads.  Road trans-
port has expanded rapidly in recent years, growing at an average rate of
8.5% per annum between 1964 and 1972; and vehicle density, one per 20 persons,
is the fifth highest among the Latin American and Caribbean countries.
Generally, roads are narrow, winding and in relatively poor condition making
travel slow and vehicle operation costly.  Based upon a CIDA-financed transport
survey conducted by the consulting firm, Lamarre Valois International Ltd.
(Canada) in 1968-70, major improvements to the road network system are being
undertaken. A Bank loan of $9.3 million (ln. 899-JM) in June 1973 is helping
to Linance a road improvement and maintenance project and a loan of $13.5 mil-
3ion for construction of about 20 miles of arterial roads was approved by the
Rank in July of this year. Assistance is also being provided by CIDJA for a
bridge construction program, by the IDB for the construction of secondary main
and parish roads, and by AID for construction of rural feeder roads.
18.       The railway, run by the Jamaica Railways Corporation (JRC) has in
recent years lost most of its general traffic to the roads and is now largely
a contract carrier for the bauxite mining companies. The JRC is operating at
a small loss (J$500,000) largely because it provides a subsidized passenger
service to some of the poorer areas where the road system is deficient. The
two main seaports at Kingston and Montego Bay are general cargo ports and
handle most of the country's imports; other ports are specialized and handle
mainly exports. A major program is under way for the development of Kingston
as a transshipment port at an estimated cost of J$41.0 million.
Air Transport in Jamaica
19.       Two international airports and several small domestic airports and
airstrips serve air transport requirements. The international airports are
located at Montego Bay (Sangster Airport) on the north coast, serving mainly
the tourist industry, and Kingston (Norman Manley Airport) on the south coast,
catering primarily to business and private travel by residents. The national
airlire, Air Jamaica (in which Air Canada has a 34% equity interest), and 11
foreign airlines provide scheduled international services between Jamaica and
over 40 foreign centers. As a result of increased tourism to the island and
the country's expanding economy, air traffic has grown rapidly in Jamaica. Over
the period 1967-72 the annual growth of foreign passenger traffic at Sangster
Airport has averaged 13% and at Manley about 11%. In 1972 the two airports
handled an aggregate 1.6 million passengers and 93,000 aircraft movements.



In 1973 the rate of growth in the number of tourists was not as rapid
as in previous years and this may continue through 1974., partly as a result
of the recent slower growth in the number of flights and increases in
ticket prices; consequently some decline was experienced in the rate of
growth of passenger traffic at the two international airports during 1973
and during the first six months of 1974. However, despite recent
increases in prices of fuel and their impact on traffic demand from tourist-
generating countries, as well as other prospective consequences of recent
changes in international oil prices, the situation is expected to improve
after 1974 and average annual rates of growth in total passenger traffic
are forecast for both airports at just under 8-1/2% from 1972 to 1977 and
of almost lC0 for Sangster and 8-1/2% for Manley from 1977 through 1980.
The higher growth at Sangster reflects the larger proportion of tourist
traffic. Somewhat slower annual growth rates in freight and aircraft
movements are also expected.
20.      At present the Civil Aviation Department (CAD) of the Ministry of
Public Utilities, Communications and Transport is responsible for the control
and regulation of all civil aviation activities in Jamaica, including the
operation of airports and related facilities such as air traffic control
and navigational aids. The present organization, however, suffers from a
number of weaknesses. There is a clear need for financial objectives to be
established, supported by appropriate financial and accounting systems, so
that major revenue-earning enterprises such as the airports can be operated
on a proper commercial basis. In addition, there is need for more effective
forward planning and the development of a well-defined management and staffing
structure. To this end, the government, on the recommendation of consultants,
enacted legislation on July 31, 1974 to establish a new independent statutory
body, the Airports Authority of Jamaica (AAJ) to take over the day-to-day
operations and management of the two international airports; responsibility
for all other aspects of civil aviation under the existing Civil Aviation
Act will remain with the CAD.
PART V - THE PROJECT
21.       Following the recommendations of the national transport survey
undertaken by Lamarre Valois International (paragraph 17 above) a master
plan for the long-range development of the two internationml airports was
prepared, under terms of reference agreed by the Bank and with CIDA-financing,
by the consulting firms, Kates, Peat, Marwick and Comparn and the Montreal
Engineering Company. The master plan included as a first stage investment a
substantial expansion and upgrading of both international airports. However,
in view of its other public investment priorities the government decided in
1972 to concentrate on developing Sangster airport with only limited interim
improvements to Manley airport. The Bank appraised a project on these lines
in May 1973 but increasing budgetary constraints and the onset of the energy
crisis led to a further redefinition of the project at the end of 1973. The
major change is that a new passenger terminal building at Sangster airport
has been deferred for the time being.

22.      Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington in
May of this year and final approval of the loan documents by the govern-
ment and the newly established AAJ was received on August 20, 1974. The
government negotiating team was led by Mr. H. Barber, Financial Secretary,
Ministry of Finance. The AAJ was represented by the-then Chairman
designate, Mr. A. Alberga. A report entitled "Jamaica - Airport Development
Project" (No. 405a-JM dated August 20, 1974), is being distributed sepa-
rately to the Executive Directors. The main features of the loan and
the project are summarized in Annex III of this report.
Project Objectives
23.       The principal objectives of the project are to relieve capacity
constraints to continued growth of international air traffic to Jamaica,
thereby supporting a major source of foreign exchange, and to improve the
institutional base, both managerially and financially, for operating the
tw'o international airports. The project would provide the minimum acceptable
level of passenger and aircraft service to meet forecast traffic until 1980,
and would provide a sound starting point for a longer-term development of
the airports thereafter.
Project Description
24.       The proposed project includes:   (a) physical works at the two
international airports to improve aircraft ground handling and passenger
processing; (b) improvement of air traffic control and air navigation facili-
ties to reduce delays and increase safety; and (c) technical assistance to
help organize and establish the AAJ and to supervise the execution of the
physical aspects of the project.
25.       At Sangster, the existing terminal building would be modified to
increase passenger capacity, and improve processing procedures. A new partly
constructed parallel taxiway would be completed, a simple separate structure
to handle charter passengers would be erected and the aircraft parking apron
extended to accommodate wide-body aircraft. At Norman Manley, modificaticns
would be made to the terminal building to improve passenger flow and to the
parking apron to provide an additional aircraft position and improved apron
utilization. The runway would be lengthened by 600 feet to provide better
take-off parameters for Air Jamaica's long-range aircraft which have recently
commenced non-stop service to Europe. At both airports improved baggage
handling and rearrangement and expansion of passenger waiting areas would be
undertaken to alleviate problems of passenger processing.   Electrical distribu-
tion systems, switchgear and airfield lighting would be modernized and improve-
inents would be made to the water, sewerage and storm-water drainage systems. In
addition, more effective navigation aids would be installed at both airports.
The project would also include the provision of telecommunications equip-
ment to improve air control, air-ground communication as well as modern
crash/rescue equipment and motorized runway sweepers. The government
has agreed that by December 31, 1976 a program satisfactory to the Bank for
air traffic control, aeronautieal cowminications and aviation mot.orologieal
services including related training and syFites modernization will be drawn
up by the government, and thereafter implemented (draft Loan Agreemnt;
Section 4.03).   Tho governxnt will also by December 31, 1976



- 9 -
establish regulations to safeguard the orderly development of the
airports and protect their environment (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.02).
26.      The above improvements would result in increased efficiency,
and greater safety of operations and comfort of passengers at the Sangster
and Manley airports. However, current forecasts indicate that by 1980
traffic capacity at both airports will again be severely strained and that,
as recommended in the master plan, additional passenger terminal space will
be required at both airports. It is expected that the government will
approach the Bank to help finance this expansion. In order to prepare for
the planned expansion during 1978 to 1980, the project includes detailed
engineering and architectural studies and design for the next phase of the
master plan. Any substantial investment subsequent to the project and
before 1981 would be decided on in agreement with the Bank (draft Project
Agreement; Section 4.05); this would permit the Bank to be satisfied that
the scope and timing of any such investment is justified by the projected
rate of increase in traffic after 1976/77. The planned expansion of the
airports would complement the large investments in tourist and transportation
infrastructure already under way in Jamaica. To ensure a coordinated and
orderly approach to future tourist investment the government has undertaken
to formulate an integrated tourist development plan for the island (draft
Loan Agreement; Section 4.02).
Project Execution
27.       As the AAJ is a newly created entity which has not yet been
fully staffed it is proposed that the Bank loan be made to the government
and that the physical aspects of the project be implemented by the
Ministry of Works. For this purpose a project team would be formed within
the Ministry of Works and staffed by government personnel; the team
would be assisted by consultants who would provide design and construction
supervision services, and train Ministry counterpart ataff in the pro-
ject team. The appointment of the ccnsultants and the personnel of the
Ministry of Works project team on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank, would be conditions of loan effectiveness (draft Loan Agreement;
section 6.01). In order to ensure the necessary coordination between the
yarious entities and ministries involved in the project an inter-departmental
steering committee will be established.
The AAJ and CAD
28.       A major objective of the project is to ensure the establishment
of the AAJ on a sound managerial, technical and financial basis. The
organizational and salary structure of the AAJ will be determined in
consultation with the Bank and the Bank will also be consulted about the
appointment of the general manager and the financial, operating, and
personnel managers immediately below him. It would be a condition of
loan effectiveness that consultants had been contracted, on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank: (a) to assist the AAJ to establish
its initial organization and salary structure and to advise on the intro-
duction of appropriate management, accounting and information systems,
including management training and development; and (b) to assist CAD
in the improvement of its organization and its management techniques
(draft Loan Agreement; Sectiorn 4.05 and 6.01).

Cost Estimates
29.      The total cost of the project is estimated at $19.6 million includ-
ing contingencies but excluding duties and taxes. The Bank would finance
the foreign exchange costs estimated at $10.9 million and, in order to allow
a reasonable period for the newly created AAJ to establish itself on a sound
financial footing, it is proposed that interest on the Bank loan during
construction estimated at $1.6 million be capitalized. The loan would there-
fore total $12.5 million of which $11.3 million would be relent to the AAJ,
at 8% interest with the same grace period and term as the Bank loan to the
government. The sub-loan would be denominated in US dollars and the AAJ
would bear the foreign exchange risk arising out of any exchange rate adjustments
between the US dollar and the Jamaican dollar. The government would bear the
residual foreign exchange risk. These on-lending arrangements would be embodied
in a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the government and tle AAJ which would
be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 6.01). The remaining proceeds of the Bank loan ($1.2 million) would
be retained by the government for project expenditures by its CAD. Local
costs of the project estimated at $8.8 million would be financed by a govern-
ment equity contribution to AAJ of $4.3 million and an AAJ cmntribution of
$4.5 million from its revenues.
Procurement
30.       Major civil works and equipment procurement contracts (other than
the navigational equipment referred to below) would be awarded through in-
ternational competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for
Procurement". Related civil works items would be grouped together as much
as possible but it is unlikely that any one paokage would attract wide-
international interest due largely to the diversity and small size and value
of the packages. Smaller structures and related works contracts, estimated to
cost a total of $1.0 million, would be advertised for local competitive bidd-
ing. Certain navigational equipment, which is urgently required and needs to
be standardized with existing equipment and which is estimated in the aggre.-
gate to cost about $400,000, would be purchased by direct negotiation with
suppliers.
Disbursement
31.       Disbursement of the Bank loan would extend over about three years
and would be at a rate of 55% of total expenditures for civil works, repre-
senting the estimated foreign exchange component, 100% of foreign expendi-
tures for directly imported navigation, communications and other equipment,
and 100% of foreign expenditures for foreign consulting services and 70% of
local expenditures for local consultants. Disbursement against locally pro-
cured imported equipment would be at a rate of 90% of local expenditures. In
order to avoid delay in the preparation of detailed design and engineering,
and in setting up the AAJ,certain preparatory work is already being undertaken
by consuLltants; in addition, the CAD has placed orders for certain urgently
required navigational equipment for the project. It is therefore recommended that
expenditures incurred after April 1, 1974 and before loan signing for these can-
sulting services and navigational equipment, and not exceeding $550,000 in the
aggregate, should be financed retroactively from the loan proceeds.



Financial Evaluation
32.       It is the government's intention that the newly established AAJ
should be a commercially viable body and should earn revenues sufficient to
cover cash operating expenses, debt service, and a contribution,to invest-
ment including a return to government on its capital invested. The authority's
financial structure will include equity consisting of ordinary shares to be
held by the government and retained earnings of AAJ built up from annual
surpluses. The government would provide AAJ with initial equity equivalent
to: (i) the net depreciated value of the fixed assets of the two international
airports taken over on vesting day and (ii) a government contribution to the
local costs of the proposed project (paragraph 29 above) amounting to at
least US$4.3 million. AAJ woulditBelf service its long-term debt including
US$11.3 million of the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan. The government and AAJ
have agreed with the Bank that (a) the existing assets of the airports to be trans-
ferred to the AAJ will be valued in accordance with a method satisfactory to the
Bank and that provision for depreciation will be made in AAJ's accounts based
on this valuation and (b) any future transfer of domestic airports to the AAJ will
be made after consultation with the Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Section 4.08;
draft Project Agreement, Sections 3.04 and 3.06).
33.       The government proposes to introduce substantial increases in air-
craft landing fees over the period to 1978 and the government has agreed that
annual revenues from the passenger departure tax in excess of the present
level of J$1.2 million should be retained by the AAJ as airport operating
revenues (draft Loan Agreement; Section 4.04). The level of all airport user
charges will be reviewed not later than December 31, 1975 and revised as
necessary to cover the costs of services provided.
34.       Financial projections indicate that although operating deficits are
likely in 1974 and 1975 the AAJ can cover all its cash needs during this period.
Net inccme is modest during the rest of the project period but by 1980 reaches
a level where AAJ can safely pay a dividend to government on its equity which for
the period 1980-85 has been set at 7% per annum. Forecast revenue accounts indi-
cate that AAJ should be able to achieve a rate of return on net fixed assets of
about 7% in 1978 when the project has been completed, rising to about 10 % by 1981.
To ensure that AAJ after a reasonable period raises sufficient revenues to meet
its requirements, AAJ will undertake to take all necessary steps, including ad-
justment of its charges, to produce revenues in each year commencing January 1,1978
sufficient to cover operating expenses, service debt and pay an appropriate divi-
dend on issued share capital; in addition the AAJ would finance from these revenues
at least 40% of capital expenditures over each three-year period (draft Project
Agreement, Section 4.03). The AAJ has also agreed (draft Project Agreement,
Section 4.04) that it will not incur any long-term debt (other than for financing
the project) without the prior approval of the Bank, if its consolidated net
revenues for the financial year or a later 12-month period ended prior to in-
curring the debt is less than 1.25 times its maximum future debt service re-
quirements in any succeeding financial year.

35.       With the help of consultants to be financed from the loan, the
AMJ will establish a modern accounting system, capable of readily identifying
the costs and revenues applicable to major functional centers at the airports
within one year of the loan becoming effective.    Independent auditors,
satisfactory to the Bank, will be appointed within one year from the intro-
duvction of the new accounting system.
_roject Justification and Economic Evaluation
36.       Jamaica has shown impressive growth in tourist and business visitors
in recent years. Tourism in particular is an important source of foreign exchange
earnings (amounting to an estimated $115 million in 1973) as well as providing
much-needed employment opportunities. In order to retain this growth, a sizable
irvestment program is being undertaken in hotels, Air Jamaica is expanding its
fleet of aircraft and an active program to promote the influx of foreign tourists
has been launched in many foreign countries.   However, in recent years invest-
ment in the two international airports has consisted largely of maintenance and
minor ad hoc works to cope with immediate problems.    The system has not
therefore been able to keep pace with the recent increase in the growth of
traffic.   Airport installations, including passenger handling facilities, air
traffic control equipment and navigational aids have become inadequate to meet
present needs at an acceptable level of service during peak periods.    The result-
ing delays and inconvenience to passengers and airline operations are reaching
serious levels and improvements are now urgently required, in the framework of
a longer-term development plan for the airports, to meet requirements during
the next few years.   The proposed improvements at the two international airports
would complement the other large tourist-related expenditures already referred to.
For the purposes of the economic evaluation, at Sangster Airport the
(puantifi.ed benefits accruing to the international community consist of the
71ircraft time-savings resulting from the parallel taxiway and improved terminal
and apron area.  The full aircraft cost savings accruing to Air Jamaica and the
additional landing fees to be recovered from foreign airlines as a result of the
project hvave been considered as a Jamaican benefit. As regards passenger benefits,
t-.e;e is ev;dence that delay times at airports, under congested and trying cir-
ciu:s;_nces, are likely to lead to a  loss of visitors who have a wide choice
.^. :-vi-,ernative destinations. The entire net foreign exchange contribution for
-!nisD loss of visitors has been considered a total potential loss to the
Jamaican economy.
'.d.      There is a high degree o.f interdependence between Sangster and Manley
airoorts and since the two airports will offer similar services after iiprove-
men- s made at both of them under the project, the proposed increases in landing
Cee tariffs will have to be the same for both airports. Therefore, the same
landing fee increases used for Sangster have been applied to the Manley aircraft
movements as a measure of the minimrum value of the Manley improvements to the
airlines.  Passenger-time savings accruing to Jamaican residents have been in-
cluded in the auantificaticn of benefits at Manley, but in view of the limited
number of tourist visitors arriving through this airport, the potential loss
frorm deterred traffic has not been included.



- 13 -
39.       The economic return of the project for the Jamaican economy is
estimated at about 19% for each airport individually.    Disregarding any
passenger benefits, the rate of return is estimated at 14% for Sangster
and at 15% for Manley.   The first year return is above 14%.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Loan Agreement between Jamaica and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between the Bank and AAJ, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
41.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
42.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C Proje-2ts in S:_cKutiorr-
Lr No. 727  Second Education Project; US$13.5 million of March 25, 1971
Closing Date:  December 31, 1975
Managerial weaknesses in both the Education Ministry and the
proj3ct unit have caused delays in the implementation of the project; imple-
mentation is about two years behind appraisal schedule. It is expected that
all the project items will be completed by December 1976.    A postponement
of the closing date by a year and a half is likely to be required. Because
of the late implementation, devaluation of the Jamaican dollar and inter-
national inflation a cost overrun of about 25% is likely.   The project unit
is understaffed. The project director, whose contract has expired, has not
yet been replaced and the project architect post is vacant. The government
is considering the possibility of transferring project implementation to a new
govenment agency and the Bank is in contact with the government on the urgent
need to strengthen the management of the project.
Ln No. 719 Agricultural Credit Project; US$3.7 million of December 28, 1970
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
After a slow start the project picked up momentum during the last
year and the Bank loan is now about fully committed. Disbursements have not
improved equally but the Jamaica Development Bank (JDB) has taken steps to
streamline and simplify procedures which have mainly accounted for the delays.
The Bank has agreed to a second reallocation of the loan proceeds to increase
credit availability for beef and dairy production.
Ln No. 690  Population Project; US$2.0 million of June 18, 1970
Closing Date: March 31, 1975
There have been dalays in the design/construction programs for
the Victoria Jubilee Hospital (VJH) and ten rural maternity centers (RMCs),
due primarily to problems of coordination, and weaknesses in the management
of the family planning program. However, more recently improved progress
has been made in implementing some of the principal aspects of the program.
Construction of all ten RMCs has been physically completed, 5 are already
operating and the remaining five will open within the next 3 months. Con-
structicn has started on the VJH expansion; during a Bank supervision mis-
sion in April, the Ministry of Works agreed to undertake stricter supervision
of the contractor and to provide site security, in response to earlier problems
that were causing constructian delays. Progress has been slow in implementing
the training and home encouragement aspects of the family planning program,
but intensified efforts are being made in these areas through the use of com-
munity health aides. The family planning services have been integrated into
the Ministry of Health and the Bank is providing technical assistance for
redesigning the program.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this senee, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln No,98    Kingston Water Su      Project; US$5.0 million of May 1h, 1969
Closin& Date: December 31, 1974
After initial delays over the acquisition of land rights and in the
award of contracts, impLementation of the physical aspects of the project has improved
and the works are now partially in operation. Full service should be in operation by
July 197T although optimum pressure w41ll not be available until after delivery of
certain booster pumping equipment in about 3 months' time. The loan closing date,
originally June 30, 1972, has been postponed to December 31, 1973 and again to
December 31, 1974h. However, the financial position of the Water Commission remains
weak and the amnual rates of return over the last three fiscal years were significantly
below the 8% required in the Loan Agreement. Substantial increases in water rates
were introduced in June 1973, but since then increased operating costs, largely due
to higher wages, have again eroded the Commission's financial position. However,
the Water Commission is taking action to reduce its operating costs and is considering
measures to ensure the maintenance of adequate revenues from water tariffs. Other
measures to remedy staffing and management weaknesses are currently under discussion
between the Bank and the Borrower.
Ln No. 899 Road Improvement and Maintenance Project; US$9.3 million of June 1, 1973
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
This loan became effective August 31, 1973 and is progressing satisfac-
torily. Consultants to carry out the technical assistance component of the project
started their assignment in October 1973 and government has appointed all counterparts.
Contractors for the first phase of the resealing work have been engaged and works
started in June.   A number of roads to be resealed under the project were damaged
by floods in late 1973. In order to get them back into operation as quickly as
possible and prevent further deterioration, the Bank agreed that about 40 miles of
the total 250 miles to be resealed under tho project should be repaired by force
account rather than by contractors; this work is under way. Bids for equipment have
been received and invitations to bid for phase I of the asphaltic concrete overlay
work were issued in July.
Ln No. 1003 Sites and Services Project; US$15.o million of June 13, 1974
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
Invitations to bid for the infrastructure and for the core housing units
have been issued for the Camplands, Marcus Garvey and Spanish Town sites. The Director
of the Sites and Services Unit has been appointed. Invitations will be shortly issued
for proposals for the clagnostic study of the programs, organization and staffing of
the Ministry of Housing. The terminal date for the effectiveness of the loan has been
postponed from August 14, the original date, to September 13, 1974 to provide additional
time for the Borrower to execute the Subsidiary Loan Agreement.
Ln No. 1004 Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$5.5 million of June 13, 1974
Closing Dste: December 31, 1977
This recently signed loan is not yet effective.
Ln No. 1032 Third Highway Project; US$13.5 million of July 26, 1974
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Prequalification of contractors for the civil works is under way. Invita-
tions will be sent to consultants not later than the end of August 1974 for proposals
for supervision of the execution of the civil works. The loan is not yet effective.

bidding. Certain navigational equipment (estimated to cost
about $400,000 in the aggregate) would, for reasons of
standardization, be purchased by direct negotiation with
suppliers. Expenditures incurred after April 1. 1974 and
before loan signing for consulting services and navigational
equipment, and not exceeding $550,000 in the aggregate,
would be financed retroactively from the loan proceeds.
