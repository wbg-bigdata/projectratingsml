                         Program Development Objective (from Program Document)

                         The DPL will support the Government's Anti-Crisis Plan to protect the social gains made in the past decade and reinforce the framework for economic recovery.
                          The SSGER DPL is included in the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), which is being presented to the Board at the same time and complements other
                         investment operations. While the SSGER DPL will contribute to meeting the immediate financing needs of the Government, it will also serve as a bridge
                         between the ongoing DPL and a possible programmatic DPL series in FY11 and FY12.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                            Yes           No

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The 9 prior actions of the DPL were met by the time of signing of the Program. The DPL was approved by the Congress on August 27, 2010 and disbursed immediately after
                         effectiveness.

                         The progress towards the expected outcomes described in the program document has been substantial. One of the expected outcomes (80 percent of individuals in the poorest
                         municipalities are formally registered and receiving prevention and promotion services through the Model of Integrated Health Care Services) is likely to be achieved by December
                         31, 2010. The other expected outcome (the elaboration of a new curriculum for the teaching of science and technology in upper secondary school) will be achieved later, as the
                         Government has focused on reforming primary education curriculum.

                         The Government agreed to receive an ICR mission in February or March 2011.
