                                11 municipalities.
                          Strengthening institutional capacity for policy formulation and
                          implementation in the social sectorsfor economic recovery:

                          The SSGER DPL i s included in the proposed World Bank Group's
                          Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009-2010 (Report No. 50642-
                          SV), which i s being presented to the Board at the same time and

                                                  i
                          complements other investment operations. While the SSGER DPL
                          w i l l contribute to meeting the immediate financing needs o f the
                          Government, i t w i l l also serve as a bridge between the ongoing DPL
                          and a possible programmatic DPL series in FY 11 and FY 12.

                                 Fiscal pressures are likely to emerge due to the sharp decline in
                                 current revenues associated with the economic slowdown, while
                                 expenditures w i l l grow in order to protect the poor from the
                                 effects o f the crisis. The fiscal deficit i s expected to reach 5.3%
                                 o f GDP in 2009. Even though the authorities have indicated
                                 their commitment to lower the fiscal deficit in 2010 this could
                                 prove difficult if the crisis i s longer than anticipated or the
                                 planned tax reform does not produce the expected results.
                                 Mitigation: The risk is partly mitigated through ensuring
                                 adherence to an acceptable macro-economic framework and
                                 continuous policy dialogue with the Government to ensure that
                                 incremental expenditures are targeted to protect the vulnerable
                                 population and services used by the poor. The Government has
                                 reached agreement on a new three-year Standby Arrangement
                                 with the IMF.
                                 Opposition to approval of Bank loans in Congress: The new
                                 administration does not have the required majority to approve
                                 Bank loans in Congress. In the past, lack o f Congressional
                                 approval led to cancellation o f several Bank loans. Mitigation:
                                 The Bank has made sustained efsorts to maintain dialogue on the
                                 Government's program (including with opposition parties) and
                                 the SSGER DPL is being processed as part o a package,   f
                                 including the new CPS and two investment projects supporting
                                 the Government's program.

                                             I.INTRODUCTION

1.       El Salvador i s at a critical juncture in its development, after a historical political transition
 which took place in the midst of an unfolding economic crisis triggered by global financial turmoil
 and the U.S. recession. In March 2009, President Mauricio Funes, candidate o f the Frente Farabundo
 Martipara la Liberucio'n Nacional (FMLN), the party which had been in opposition for 20 years since
 the end o f the civil war, won the Presidential elections. The FMLN also won the greatest number of
 seats in the Congress, although not enough to secure a majority. The Presidential candidate ran on an
 electoral platform with a clear social policy agenda, focusing on employment, job creation, provision of
 basic health and education services, and social protection for the poor. The new Government also
 promised improvements in the efficiency o f public spending and taxation in order to ensure the fiscal
 sustainability o f i t s ambitious medium term development strategy. The creation o f institutional
 mechanisms to promote the participatory development o f economic and social policy was also a
 cornerstone o f the electoral platform. The elections were held at a time when El Salvador was hit hard
 b y the triple shock o f rising fuel and food prices, followed b y the global financial crisis. The outcome
 o f the elections indicates a broad-based support for a reform program that touches o n every aspect o f
 economic and social policy.

2.       The impact of the global economic crisis on El Salvador has generated major economic and
 social risks and jeopardizes the ability of the new Government to implement its social policy
 agenda. By early 2009, tens of thousands o f Salvadoran households had been affected by the loss o f
 jobs, especially in the export sector, reduction in incomes and a sharp drop in remittances. The sharp
 downturn in the U.S. economy in the first half o f 2009 magnified these impacts, due to the close links
 between the two economies. These developments compound the problem o f a rapid rise in the poverty
 rate in 2008 caused b y the increase in food prices. The new Government was also confronted with a
 rapidly deteriorating fiscal outlook, as tax revenues declined more than anticipated, constraining its
 efforts to deliver on i t s pro-poor social agenda. Within three weeks o f assuming power on June 1, 2009,
 President Funes presented the Government's Anti-Crisis Plan with priority initiatives and actions to
 protect the most vulnerable individuals o f the population, while preparing for economic recovery.' The
 Anti-Crisis Plan demonstrated the willingness o f the Government to tailor i t s agenda to the new fiscal
 realities.

3.      The Government intends to address the challenges brought by the economic crisis while
  laying the ground for a social policy that i s sustainable and responds to the long-term
  development agenda. In December 2008, faced with adverse fiscal pressures and a threat to
 macroeconomic stability, the previous Government sought and secured a two-tranche Public Finance
 and Social Sector Development Policy Loan for US$450 million from the Bank and a parallel US$ 500
 million loan from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The first tranche o f US$200 o f the
 World Bank DPL was released in February 2009 and the program was designed to have a second
 tranche disbursing in FY 11. However, the fiscal deficit for 2009 i s projected at 5.3 percent of GDP

 against an initial projection o f 2.8 percent o f GDP in the IMF Standby Arrangement (SBA) approved in
 early 2009. As a result, the Government has requested support from the multilateral institutions to
 finance the fiscal gap without having to curtail expenditures on social programs and public investment,
 which are required for the long term development o f the country.

4.      The crisis calls for a combination of interventions to strengthen social safety nets and to
  build human capital to avoid reversing the important socio-economic gains of the recent period. El
  Salvador needs to improve i t s safety net program, which i s characterized b y a large number o f small
  programs with l o w coverage which have limited impact on aggregate poverty. The most successful o f
  these has been the conditional cash transfer program for rural areas, Red Solidaria which, in 2008,
  covered 30 o f the country's poorest 100 municipalities. Aside from traditional interventions to reactivate
  the economy, expanding the coverage o f safety nets, improving training programs, generating temporary
 jobs and increasing access to secondary education w i l l be critical to prepare the country for the
  economic recovery.

5.       The Sustaining Social Gains for Economic Recovery (SSGER) DPL will assist the
 Government of El Salvador (GoES) to undertake immediate measures in the Anti-Crisis Plan to
 protect the poor, while supporting the process of economic recovery through the design of new
 initiatives and institutional strengthening in the social sectors. Apart from providing a part o f the
 financing for the Anti-Crisis Plan, the proposed DPL w i l l also enable the Bank to provide technical
 assistance in the area o f institutional strengthening and policy development to a new Government with
 limited experience in the executive branch. The SSGER DPL w i l l contribute to building a fiscally
 sustainable medium term development policy and serve as a platform for dialogue with the GoES,
 opposition parties and c i v i l society on the reform agenda.

6.       The proposed DPL i s structured around three pillars:

     a. Protecting fiscal space for social expenditures. The DPL w i l l help to protect non-personnel
        recurrent spending and essential investments that are required to sustain the quality o f education
        and health services, while generating resources from the reduction o f the transport subsidy.
     b. Protecting income and consumption of the vulnerable populations. The DPL w i l l support the
        launch o f essential social programs including the protection and extension o f access to basic
        health and education services and the provision o f temporary income support to unemployed
        persons in poor municipalities.
     C. Strengthening institutional capacity for policy formulation and implementation in the social
        sectors for economic recovery. The DPL w i l l support specific actions to build the capacity o f
        the Ministries o f Education and Health, as well as the Technical Secretariat of the President
        (Secretaria T k n i c a de la Presidencia - STP), which i s in charge o f coordinating and monitoring
        the implementation o f social policy.

7.      The SSGER DPL i s included in the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and is
 designed as a single tranche D P L . This operation complements two investment projects that w i l l be
 submitted to the Board at the same time, as well as the ongoing two-tranche DPL approved by the Board
 in January 2009. The lending envelope for FYlO i s US$250 million, o f which US$lOO million i s
 allocated for a social sector DPL. The indicative envelope for FY11 and FY12 i s US$400 million,
 subject to availability o f IBRD resources. Although no specific operations are included in the CPS as
 the lending envelope and program for outer years have not been finalized, a programmatic DPL series,
 which w i l l build on the progress under this operation, i s envisaged to ensure continuity in the policy
 dialogue in human development. While this DPL w i l l contribute to meeting the immediate financial
 needs of the Government, i t i s also designed to serve as a bridge between the ongoing two-tranche DPL
 and the possible new programmatic DPL series starting in FY11.

A. POLITICAL CONTEXT AND IMPACTS OF THE ECONOMIC CRISIS

                                   3
 education remains low, while the net enrollment rate for high school i s much lower than that o f similar
 middle income countries. As demonstrated by results from international and regional standardized
 testing scores (TIMSS 2008; SERCE 2008), the performance o f students in El Salvador i s low relative
 to other countries with a similar Human Development Index. For example, sixth graders perform below
 the regional average in every subject area (mathematics, science, reading).

11.     The need to create economic opportunities for the cohorts entering the labor market i s
 another major challenge for El Salvador, which has a relatively young population. About 34 per
 cent o f the Salvadoran population i s between 0 and 14 years old, compared to 23 percent for Uruguay,
 27 percent for Brazil, and 30 percent for Mexico (only Guatemala and Honduras have a higher child
 population share in LAC). Moreover, half o f the Salvadoran population i s less than 30 years old.
 Limited access to high school education as well as to opportunities for quality employment has
 constrained youth development. While adult unemployment rates have remained constant or even
 decreased in recent years, the unemployment rate for youth (15-24 years old) i s nearly three times
 higher, around 11.5 percent. About 80 percent o f youth are confined to informal and low-paying jobs.
 Outmigration s t i l l seems to be the most economically rational decision for a large portion o f the youth
 population.

12.    El Salvador's relatively high dependence on remittances from the United States, which
 support the incomes of a significant proportion of poor households, also makes the country highly
 vulnerable to external shocks. I 2007, workers' remittances (mainly from the U.S.) represented 18.1
                                   n
 percent of GDP. The extent o f dependence on remittances has increased rapidly between 2000 and
 2007. More than 26 percent o f Salvadoran households received remittances in 2007, compared to 20
 percent in 2000. The level o f dependence i s greater among rural households (29.2 percent) than in
 urban households (25.2 percent). Remittances contribute 42 percent o f the income o f recipient
 households. About 12 percent o f these households (nearly 150,000 households) receive more than 50
 percent o f their income from remittances. Interestingly, remittances are relatively more important for
 households in the second, third and fourth quintiles than for the richest or poorest households.

13.     I n 2008, the poverty rate rose sharply, almost entirely wiping out the gains in poverty
 reduction of the decade and demonstrating El Salvador's vulnerability to external economic
 shocks. The poverty rate rose to 42.3 percent, similar to the rate in 2001 (43.6). The rural poverty rate
 shot up to 45.3 percent in 2008 from about 40 percent in 2007, reversing a decline from 52 percent to 35
 percent between 2001 and 2006. In urban areas, the proportion o f poor was actually higher in 2008 than
 in 2001 (40.7 and 37.2 percent, respectively). This rise in the poverty rate was almost entirely due to the
 steep increase in the price o f food staples o f about 8 percent in 2007 and 17 percent in 2008, while
 income was almost stagnant.

14.      The on-going economic crisis will increase unemployment and lower incomes, compounding
 the negative impacts of the food and fuel price increases of 2008. Unemployment i s expected to
 increase with job losses in the maquilas and other industries, as well as in the construction and service
 sectors. Migration, which has traditionally absorbed a significant share of new entrants to the labor
 force, has become relatively less attractive as the job opportunities in the U S have shrunk. These
 developments come on top o f a sharp increase o f 2.1 percentage points in the labor force participation
 rate in 2008, possibly reflecting an attempt b y households to cope with the rise in the cost o f food. As a
 result, underemployment rose in 2008 to 32 percent, compared to 27 percent in 2007. These impacts
 may lead to stagnation or even an increase in poverty rates.

15.      The projected reduction in remittances from the United States will also have a perceptible
 impact on incomes and poverty. Data from the Central Bank o f El Salvador show that there has been
 a reduction in remittances o f around 13-14 percent in real terms in the 12 months up to January 2009.
 Simulations done in the context o f the Bank's on-going analytical work on the social sectors indicate
 that if remittances o f all households were reduced by 15 percent, the overall poverty headcount would

                                                     4
 rise by 0.9 percentage points, -1.13 and 0.73 in rural and urban areas, respectively. These increases in
 the incidence o f poverty would push approximately 5 1,000 Salvadorans below the poverty line, eroding
 a substantial part o f the gains made in poverty reduction between 2000 and 2007. Moreover, beyond the
 macroeconomic and income poverty implications, there i s concern that lower remittance flows w i l l
 negatively affect social indicators such as school enrollment and child malnutrition, as households
 adjust spending to declining revenues.

16.     Given these challenges, the GOEShas prepared an Anti-Crisis Plan for the period of 2009-
 2011 to mitigate the immediate economic and social impacts of the global economic crisis, while
 preparing the foundation for implementing its medium-term development agenda once global
 conditions improve. The Government recognizes that while enhanced social expenditures are required,
 maintaining fiscal and macroeconomic stability i s key to putting the country on a sustainable growth
 path which can support a permanent reduction in poverty and accumulation o f human capital. Hence,
 the authorities have focused on selective expansion o f the safety nets and access to education and health
 services, together with institutionalization o f the mechanisms for social policy formulation, coordination
 and implementation and improvement o f public expenditure management.

17.    The following sections outline the recent economic and social developments, the medium-term
 outlook and the country's strategies to meet both short and medium-term challenges in the context o f the
 proposed DPL.

B. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

Recent Economic Developments

18.      Until 2008, the growth performance of El Salvador was broadly positive, but the global
 crisis i s having a significant effect on the country's economy. Growth accelerated from 2.3 percent in
 2003 to 4.2 percent in 2006 and 4.7 percent in 2007 (the fastest growth rate since 1995). The observed
 acceleration in economic growth was triggered to a large extent by rapid improvements in the external
 environment which resulted in cumulative export growth o f 26.2 percent between 2002 and 2007. In
 addition, the country's traditional sound macroeconomic management facilitated the transmission o f the
 positive global developments. In 2008, however, El Salvador started feeling the effects o f the global
 crisis and, despite initial projections above 4 percent; GDP growth reached only 2.5 percent.

19.      The growth slowdown has become even more marked in the first half of 2009. According to
 the monthly indicator o f economic activity in May, economic activity contracted more than 10 percent
 with respect to May 2008. The M a y decline was smaller than the contraction observed in April (11.7
 percent) but i t marked the eighth consecutive month o f declines in economic activity. The observed
 economic contraction i s broad based as nine o f the eleven sector categories underlying the index
 contracted over the same month o f 2008. The decline was particularly sharp in commerce, hotels, and
 restaurants. Current projections foresee a decline o f GDP by about 2.5 percent in 2009. This would be
 the first full-year GDP contraction in over two decades.

20.     There are several elements behind the evolution of economic activity, including lower
  domestic investment, a dramatic deterioration in export performance, and a marked decline in
  workers' remittances. On the investment front, gross domestic investment i s expected to decline from
  16.1 percent o f GDP in 2007 to about 13.1 percent in 2009. This decline would be mainly driven by
  lower private investment which already declined from 14.1 percent o f GDP in 2007 to 12.8 percent o f
  GDP in 2008 and i s expected to further decline to 11.1 percent in 2009. At the same time, public
  investment has not been able to offset these changes as i t increased from 2 percent o f GDP in 2007 to
 just 2.1 percent in 2008 and 2009. On the export front, following the positive developments o f the past
 few years mentioned in paragraph 18, exports receipts declined over the first half o f 2009 by 16.5

                                                    5
 percent with respect to the same period of 2008 on account o f both lower volume (-14 percent) and
 lower prices (-2.5 percent). For the year as a whole, export receipts are expected to decline by about
 15.7 percent in 2009. Remittances, which in El Salvador represented 18.1 percent o f GDP in 2008,
 started to decrease in the second semester o f 2008 and abruptly dropped in the first quarter o f 2009.
 Indeed, over the first six months o f 2009 remittances reached US$1,740 million, in contrast with the
 flow over the f i r s t six months o f 2008 when remittances reached US$1,939 million (Le. a decline o f
 more than 10 percent).

21.     The economic contraction i s having a negative impact on the country's labor markets. The
 2008 (formal) unemployment rate was 5.9 percent (the lowest in more than one decade) and even if El
 Salvador does not report periodical figures, the available information points to a significant increase in
 2009. According to the Salvadoran Institute for Social Security (Institute Salvadorefio de Segun'dad
 Social -ISSS), which provides monthly figures on the evolution o f private sector workers contributing
 to social security, formal employment was falling at an annualized rate o f 3 percent in February 2009.
 Taking into account the existing correlation between national employment rates and social security
 contributions (0.78), the country's unemployment could increase to about 9-10 percent by the end o f
 2009 (the highest in more than one decade).

22.     The crisis has resulted in an increasingly tight fiscal situation. El Salvador had been making
 continued improvements on the fiscal front over the past few years, with the non-financial public sector
 deficit falling to 1.9 percent o f GDP in 2007 from a peak o f 4.4 percent in 2001 and 2002. Notably, the
 primary balance showed a surplus o f 0.6 percent o f GDP in 2007 for the first time in more than a
 decade. The observed fiscal consolidation was largely due to strong revenue performance as the
 Government managed to increase tax revenues by nearly 1.0 percent o f GDP between 2005 and 2007.
 However, this trend did not persist in 2008 as public spending increased at faster rate than fiscal revenue
 (15 and 10 percent with respect to 2007, respectively). As a result, 2008 closed with a fiscal deficit o f
 3.1 percent o f GDP.

23.      The fiscal situation has continued to deteriorate during the first half of 2009 to a large
 extent because of the negative impact of the crisis on tax collection. As in many other countries, the
 economic slowdown has resulted in a significant decline in tax revenue. During the f i r s t half o f 2009 tax
 collection (which represents three quarters o f fiscal revenues) was 12 percent lower than during the
 same period o f the previous year and for the year as whole estimates o f Government revenue have been
 cut down from 17.2 percent o f GDP to 15.7 percent. On the spending side, the government has been
 showing restraint keeping spending levels below those envisaged in the IMF Standby program approved
 in early 2009. Yet, as a percentage o f GDP public spending i s expected to increase from an early
 estimate o f 20.1 percent to a current estimate if 20.8 percent. The combination o f these elements i s
 expected to result in a public sector fiscal deficit o f 5.3 percent o f GDP in 2009. This would be in
 contrast to a projection o f 2.8 percent o f GDP in the IMF Standby program. In order to finance the
 larger than anticipated fiscal deficit, the main political parties reached an agreement in June 2009 to use
 the proceeds of the IDB and World Bank budget support operations approved in late 2008 and early
 2009. The Government had initially planned to use the proceeds o f these operations to pre-amortize the
 Eurobond series coming due in 201 1, when the country's debt service i s expected to more than double
 reaching $1.4 billion versus an average o f $650 million during 2008-2010. As part o f the same
 agreement, the Government was also authorized to issue medium-term debt to cover the financing needs
 associated with the Eurobond. The Government has also sought multilateral support to cover the fiscal
 gap o f 2009 and t h i s DPL i s a response to that request.

24.    The mirror image of the evolution of the fiscal deficit i s the evolution of public debt levels.
 After declining from 42.1 percent o f GDP in 2003 to 39.1 percent of GDP in 2007, the stock o f total
 public debt increased to 41.2 percent o f GDP (of which 23.7 percent was external public debt) in 2008



                                                      6
 and i s expected to further increase in 2009 to 47.7 percent o f GDP (of which 30 percent would be
 external public debt).

25.     On the external front, the current account deficit i s expected to improve in 2009. After
 averaging 3.5 percent o f GDP in 2005-2006, the current account deficit expanded to 5.5 percent o f GDP
 in 2007. This deficit was financed by large capital inflows (7.0 percent o f GDP), in part related to the
 sale o f three major domestic banks to foreign buyers in 2007. The current account deficit further
 deteriorated in 2008 to 7.2 percent as a result o f the high food and o i l prices. As with most countries in
 the region, imports have contracted more than exports in 2009. As a result, the current account deficit i s
 expected to fall to 1.7 percent o f GDP as the trade balance improves.

26.       Following the dramatic spike due to rising oil and food prices, inflation has moderated in
 2009. During 2008, inflation accelerated drastically to levels not seen in more than a decade. In the
 first semester o f 2008, inflation rose to 9 percent. Most o f this increase i s explained by rising food and
 o i l prices. The current crisis followed this period o f high inflation that was strongly felt among the
 poorest households. Food inflation reached 16.4 percent, while inflation for the poor tripled to 11
 percent (3.6 percent in 2007). Inflation was reduced to 5.5 percent in December 2008, and by June 2009
 the country was approaching deflation as the annual headline inflation rate fell to 0.2 percent. Despite
 the deflationary pressures the Central Bank s t i l l expects to end the year at about 1 percent (see Table 2).

27.     The banking sector in El Salvador has coped relatively well with both the global financial
 crisis and the change in administration. In addition to the challenges presented by global
 developments, during 2009 Salvadoran investors and bankers were concerned about the political r i s k s

                                                               7
  that they associated with a potential triumph o f the FMLN, the leftist party, in the January 2009 national
  assembly elections and the March 2009 presidential elections. Bankers and supervisors were afraid that
  such a triumph could prompt a run on the banks. T o address this concern, the Superintendence o f Banks
  had raised the liquidity requirements from 25 percent to 28 percent o f deposits, counting as liquid only
  assets deposited abroad in highly liquid instruments (managed by the Central Bank). As a result o f the
  raised requirements and o f their own concerns, banks raised their liquidity ratios to an average that, b y
  M a y 2009, had reached 46 percent o f assets. Eventually, the FMLN won both the presidential and
  congressional elections (although i t fell quite short o f commanding a majority in the Assembly), but the
  feared run did not take place.

28.     Currently, capital adequacy ratios are at levels comparable to those observed before the
 current financial turmoil and well above the regulatory minimum of 12 percent. The system i s also
 relatively liquid with net liquid assets to short-term liabilities o f 34.4 percent. However, the combined
 effect o f the decline in growth and lower remittances i s leading to an increase in non-performing loans
 (NPLs) (see Figure 1). B y February 2009, N L had increased by 30 percent relative to the same month
                                                Ps
 in 2008. While there are no data relative to sectors, it i s significant that the two banks with the higher
 exposure to consumer credit have the highest level o f NPLs as well as the highest rate o f growth o f
 these loans. B y February, four o f the five largest banks had provisioned between 100 percent and 122
 percent of the NPLs, and only one o f them was marginally below 100 percent.

29.      Bank profitability, however, i s declining. At this moment, the banks are primarily concerned
 with their declining profitability, which i s the result o f (a) l o w return assets associated with high levels
 o f liquidity and (b) growing levels o f provisions prompted b y the increasing NPLs. Yet, even though the
 two-pronged erosion of the profitability o f the banks i s a source o f concern, the banks are s t i l l making
 profits.

Macroeconomic Outlook

30.    Recent indicators suggesting that economic activity i s starting to turn around in the United
 States are particularly relevant in the Salvadoran context. Forty-eight percent o f Salvadoran
 exports are directed to the United States. Furthermore, as mentioned previously, workers' remittances
 (mainly from the United States) represent more than 15 percent o f GDP. Thus, to the extent that demand
                                                                                    S
 for Salvadoran products and remittances increase in parallel to a potential U recovery, the economic
 prospects o f the country w i l l also increase. Current estimates foresee a recovery in GDP growth rates to
 about 0.5 percent in 2010, 2 percent in 2011, and around 3 percent in 2012 and 4 percent in 2013 and
 2014(see Table 3).

31.    Inflation i s expected to remain under control in the medium term. The current medium term
 macroeconomic framework incorporates projections for the inflation rate that would be consistent with a
 moderate increase to 2.5 percent in 2010 and 2.8 percent in 2011 and beyond. These projections already
 incorporate the rebound in o i l prices observed since February 2009 (when the barrel o f West Texas
 Intermediate o i l reached US$39.1) to US$69.9 by midyear, and the recovery in food prices which, after
 having declined b y 40 percent in the second half o f 2008, increased about 12 percent between January
 and June 2009.

32.      I n a similar vein, the current account deficit i s expected to deteriorate in 2010 with respect
 to 2009, but the deficit i s expected to be contained slightly below the levels of 2005 and 2006,
 before the food and oil crisis hit the country. These developments would be driven b y a combination
 o f factors o f which the following are worth highlighting: the expected additional pressure on the import
 front as the prices o f commodities and food recover, and the relief provided from an expected recovery
 in remittances flows in parallel to the expected improvements in the U.S. labor market. On the financing
 front, foreign direct investment (FDI) i s also expected to recover from less than 1 percent o f GDP in
 2009 to the levels observed before the crisis, which hovered around 2-3 percent, with the exception o f
 2007 when FDI reached 7 percent in connection with the sale o f three banks.

33.     The deterioration of the fiscal situation, however, has turned i t into the main source of
 macroeconomic concern, but the Government i s taking measures to maintain a disciplined stance.
 The 2010 fiscal deficit (projected at 4.3 percent o f GDP) i s expected to decline slightly with respect to
 the one in 2009 as the modest recovery projected for next year w i l l not likely result in dramatic
 improvements on the tax collection front. Similarly, the 2010 budget i s expected to include about
 US$355 million (1.5 percent o f GDP) in programs and projects from the Government's US$560 million
 Anti-Crisis Plan, pushing public spending to 21.4 percent o f GDP. In order to cover at least in part the
 additional financing needs emerging from the revised deficit for 2010 the Government i s relying on
 multilateral support and policy measures to keep expenditures under control and raise tax collections.
 Indeed, the Inter American Development Bank i s now preparing a US$200 million budget support
 operation planned for 2010. Beyond 2010, permanent commitments associated with the Anti-Crisis
 Plan could add between US$200 and US$250 million (depending on how coverage o f the programs
 evolves) to public spending per year (0.8 percent to 1 percent o f GDP).

34.     The Government is aware of the need to reduce the fiscal deficit to sustainable levels once
 the crisis is over. In this regard, with World Bank and IMF support, the administration i s working on
 the preparation o f legislation that w i l l include a reform of the tax administration. Measures under
 consideration include administrative actions to fight tax evasion, introduction o f new taxes (such as a
 new tax on vehicles) and adjustment o f some taxes (such as those on alcoholic beverages). On the
 spending side, the Government i s preparing a plan to rationalize (through better targeting and in some
 cases elimination or reduction) existing subsidies in the water, transport, and liquid petroleum gas
 sectors. This would be in addition to the actions already taken on the electricity front (supported b y the



                                                     9
 Bank's Public Finance and Social Sector Development Policy Loan) to reduce the electricity subsidy for
 firms. As a result, the fiscal deficit i s expected to decline to less than 2 percent of GDP in 2014.

35.    The medium term macroeconomic framework described above will be supported by a new
 three year SBA with the IMF. The authorities have requested to end the earlier SBA in 2009. That
 arrangement achieved i t s key objective o f helping the country weather the global crisis, maintaining
 macroeconomic and financial sector stability. In addition, following the IMF mission in late September
 2009, the IMF and the authorities have agreed on a new 3 year SBA. The authorities intend to treat the
 SBA as precautionary.

Debt Sustainability

36.     The recent deterioration in the medium term macroeconomic outlook of El Salvador i s also
 affecting the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) presented in the Public Finance and Social Sector
 Development Policy Loan that was approved by the Board on January 22,2009. At that time, the
 D S A projected the country's public debt level declining to below 33 percent o f GDP by 2013. Similarly,
 the D S A projected a total external debt (including both public and private) to GDP ratio o f about 40
 percent in 2013. Clearly, the higher than initially envisaged fiscal deficits in 2009 and 2010 together
 with the lower growth projections have negatively affected the medium-term public debt trajectory. On
 the other hand, the total external debt DSA remains basically unchanged as the negative impact o f the
 lower growth and inflation projections i s offset by the lower than initially envisaged current account
 deficits.

                                                       10
37.     The revised DSA indicates that the country's public debt will not fall below 47 percent until
 2014. Annex 4 indicates that public debt i s expected to increase to above 50 percent o f GDP in 201 1 to
 then start declining as the overall balance o f the public sector increase. As for the external debt, Annex 4
 indicates that total external debt to GDP ratio w i l l decline to 40 percent o f GDP by 2014.

38.    Even though the economy has entered a downturn and there are significant risks to the
 short-term outlook associated with the difficult external environment, the macroeconomic policy
 framework i s adequate for the purposes of this development policy loan.



                             1 1 THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM
                              1.

39.     The new Government's electoral platform focuses on four areas: social reform, economic
 reform, environmental sustainability, and political reform. In the area o f social reform, the
 objectives are to substantially reduce poverty, raise the quality o f education and the educational
 attainment o f the population, reduce inequity and economic and social exclusion, and promote security.
 The program proposes measures to strengthen nutritional security, reform o f the health system to ensure
 universal coverage o f basic health services, reform of the education system to move towards creating a
 knowledge society, the development o f housing and urban areas, and initiating a system o f old age
 security to cover workers in the formal and informal sectors. In the area o f economic policy, the main
 objective laid out b y the new Government i s to generate more and better quality employment, in
 particular for the youth, through promoting investment and reducing barriers for starting new
 businesses, raising the competitiveness o f agricultural production, improving access to credit, and
 creating a system o f national innovation, and scientific and technical development.

40.     The Government's program gives priority to developing policies and strategies to improve
 the coverage, equity and quality of social services, and the Anti-Crisis Plan, which was announced
 by the President within a few weeks of assuming power, focuses on key elements of this general
 program. Hence, there i s a large degree o f coherence between the Anti-Crisis Plan and the longer term
 vision o f the Government. Various sectoral Ministries are preparing draft medium-term strategies which
 are currently being discussed with key stakeholders. However, the expansion o f on-going programs and
 the introduction o f new programs, especially those involving large public expenditures, i s being done in
 a coordinated and phased manner, as part o f the Government's Anti-Crisis Plan, which i s managed b y
 the Technical Secretariat o f the Presidency.

41.     A crucial part of the Government's agenda i s the creation of new institutional mechanisms
 for consultation and participatory processes to prepare a medium-termdevelopment agenda. The
 Government has instituted a "National Dialogue" for defining a national development plan, which
 concretely involves weekly consultations with the private sector and social organizations. Another i s
 the creation o f the Economic and Social Council (Consejo Econo'mico y Social) which w i l l take the lead
 in economic and social policy formulation. The composition, functions and powers of this Council are
 currently being drafted. A third prong o f this activity comprises the development o f sectoral strategies,
 especially in the areas o f education, health, environment, agriculture, and economy, b y the respective
 sectoral Ministries through the creation o f mechanisms for conducting sectoral dialogue with relevant
 stakeholders and policy formulation. Many Ministries, including those for education and health, are
 carrying out internal re-organization to support policy development and implementation.

42.    The Ministry of Education (MINED) has begun the process of developing an education
 strategy, focusing on quality improvement, decentralization, and institutional strengthening. A
 preliminary "Plan Social Educativo 2009-2014" has been produced with six strategic lines: (i) equality
 and access to education; ( irelevant curriculum and improved learning; ( i )
                           i)                                              i iprofessional development
 and revised teachers' career status; (iv) strengthening institutional and pedagogical management in

                                                     11
 educational centers; (v) lifelong learning for youth and adult population; and (vi) integrating science and
 technology into education. In particular, MINED envisages a strong encouragement to the development
 o f science and technology, with a particular focus on improving science education from pre-school to
 the high school and training of science and technology professionals. The emphasis in curricular and
 pedagogical reform i s o n encouraging creative thinking and the creation and application o f knowledge.
 Along with science and technology, the MINED'Spolicy includes the promotion o f arts and culture as a
 transversal theme in education reform.

43.     I n health, a new draft strategy has been prepared by the Ministry of Health (Ministerio de
 Salud Ptiblica y Atencidn Social - MSPAS) to achieve universal coverage, greater equity and
 enhanced quality through the creation of an integrated network of health care services. Over the
 past three months, the new Government has met with various key actors and stakeholders in the health
 sector to discuss and analyze how to overcome the existing fragmentation within the health sector. The
 MSPAS has proposed the creation o f an integrated network o f health care services which would unite all
 the different service providers including the MSPAS, the ISSS, the military health facilities, the private
 sector and non-government organizations, which provide mostly primary health care and nutrition
 services.

        The re-organization of the health sector i s proposed along six strategic lines:

       Reform of the structure, organization and functions within the health sector, focusing o n the
       creation o f an integrated system o f primary care which prioritizes health promotion and disease
       prevention; the elaboration o f a mechanism for creating an integrated network o f public health
       services; strengthening the capacity for policy making and planning in the MSPAS; the regulation
       o f the health system, including the private sector, and promotion of community participation in
       health.
       Improving the coverage and quality of health services and their ability to cope with
       emergencies and natural disasters, including optimizing the network o f public health providers,
       creating a laboratory network to complement the health network and strengthen epidemiological
       surveillance, creating a regional network of public hospitals with division o f care between
       secondary and tertiary hospitals, administrative and financial restructuring o f the ISSS, and
       strengthening nutritional security.
       Development of human resources to include planning for current and future needs with a focus
       on providing primary health care in the poorest and most remote areas, developing the
       professional and occupational profile o f health workers, creating coordination mechanisms with
       the education and training institutions and developing community health workers, including a
       system o f training and accreditation.
       Formulation of a National D r u g Policy to ensure the availability and access to essential drugs
       in the entire network public health services and the rationalization o f the prescription and
       dispensation o f medicines
       Coordination with water and sanitation sector to ensure the provision o f safe drinking water to
       the population and the safe disposal o f waste.
       Strengthening the financing and public expenditure management of the health sector to
       ensure accessibility for the poor b y eliminating user charges; to improve public resource
       allocations to public institutions and regions in line with policy objectives and the health
       requirements o f the population; and to create mechanisms for social audit and control to promote
       transparency in the management o f the funds and combat corruption.

       The Universal System of Social Protection i s also a priority initiative of the Government
 and builds on successful experiences in El Salvador and L a t i n America. The creation o f the
 Universal System o f Social Protection (Sistema de Proteccidn Social Universal - SPSU) i s a medium-
 term objective that aims to provide a minimum standard of social services and economic opportunities

                                                    12
    to all Salvadorans. I t i s based on the principles o f citizen's rights and local governance, among other
    things. The core o f the initiative w i l l be based on Comunidades Solidarias, a program which builds o n
    the successful experience o f Red Solidaria, the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program for poor
    families in rural areas launched b y the previous Government. The Comunidades Solidarias goes
    beyond the CCT program and has four areas o f intervention to strengthen local development: (i)    human
    capital development; (ii)                                             i i income generation and productive
                                 provision o f basic public services; ( i )
    development; and (iv) local governance. In rural areas, the Comunidades Solidarias Rurales focuses o n
    the 100 poorest municipalities and w i l l increase the benefits o f the current CCT program, encourage
    investment in basic infrastructure (water and sanitation, electrification, schools, and health centers),
    provide basic pensions to the elderly who are more than 70 years old, coordinate the implementation o f
    the Programa de Vivienda Piso y Techo, and strengthen the governance capacity o f municipal
    authorities. The Comunidades Solidarias Urbanas (CSU) w i l l introduce CCTs for education in urban
    areas, activities for prevention o f youth violence and increasing security, improvement o f social
    infrastructure in the communities with high concentration o f poverty, worker training, micro-credit and
    a temporary income support program for unemployed persons.

46.     The further development of the Government's ambitious medium-term program into
 operational programs has inevitably been delayed by the economic crisis and the Government's
 first priority was to elaborate an Anti-Crisis Plan, which has four major objectives and
 components. As stated earlier, the Anti-Crisis Plan and overall program o f the Government are broadly
 consistent. The objectives o f the Plan are to: (i)
                                                   protect employment and generate new opportunities for
          i)
 work; ( iprotect the vulnerable population from the impacts o f the economic crisis; ( i )i iinitiate the
 creation o f a Universal System o f Social Protection and (iv) begin the construction o f economic and
 social policies in an inclusive manner. T o this end, the program elaborates four components o f work:

     0   Support the production and generation o f income and employment
     0   Design and launch o f the Universal System o f Social Protection (SPSU)
     0   Strengthen Management o f Public Finances
     0   Improve the institutional framework for the medium-term development agenda

47.      The component supporting productive activities envisages stimulation of small and medium
 enterprises, infrastructuredevelopment and employment generation. As part o f the recovery plan,
 the Government i s also planning to escalate public sector banking lending through two existing f i r s t tier
 institutions-Banco                              e
                      Hipotecario and Banco d Foment0 Agropecuario-and            through a second-tier
 institution that would be turned into a first tier bank -Banco Multilateral d Inversiones (BMI).'
                                                                                  e
 However, this strategy w i l l require close monitoring to ensure the financial soundness o f these
 institutions.

48.      This component of the Government Anti-Crisis Plan will also provide state guarantees to
 enable small and medium enterprises and enterprises in strategic economic sectors to increase
 access to bank credit. The Government proposes to import fertilizers and other agricultural inputs and
 distribute them at a reduced cost to small and medium agricultural producers. In 2009, 450,000
 agricultural producers in 160 municipalities are expected to benefit, with the number o f beneficiaries
 increasing to 600,000 in 2010. The Government also plans to expand and improve public services and
 basic infrastructure, including in water and sanitation, electricity, schools and health centers, as well as
 infrastructure works to mitigate risks. Finally, the program includes the construction o f housing units for
 the poor through the extension o f bank credit and subsidies for the purchase o f land. A temporary



* BMI was created to provide medium and long-term resources to the banks. Since dollarization, the commercial
banks' demand for BMI funds declined sharply because they could mobilize long-term resources much cheaper than
the cost o f BMI funds.

                                                      13
 income support, employment and training program targeted at unemployed persons will be implemented
 in 100 o f the poorest municipalities.

49.     A a prelude to developing the Universal System of Social Protection, the Anti-Crisis Plan
         s
 focuses on immediate crisis alleviation measures to ensure that investment in human capital is
 maintained. These include the provision o f nutrition services in the basic package o f health care
 services in the 131 municipalities with high levels of malnutrition among children under 3 years o f age;
 the expansion o f the ongoing school meals program to urban areas, covering all children from pre-
 school to grade 9; provision o f uniforms, shoes and school supplies to all children from pre-school to
 grade 9; the temporary extension o f health services for 6 months to workers in the formal sector who
 have lost their jobs and who had been previously covered by the ISSS; the elimination o f co-payments
 (cuotas voluntarias) for public health care services; and the supply o f essential medicines, vaccinations,
 laboratory supplies and strengthening o f the distribution and maintenance system.

50.     The Anti-Crisis Plan also proposes important measures for strengthening public finance
 and transparency. An Executive Decree including various austerity measures was promulgated in
 June 2009. As noted earlier, an important element o f the Government's strategy i s to increase tax
 collection and rationalize subsidies. These measures signal the interest o f the new Government to ensure
 continuity o f the country's traditional sound fiscal policies. The Government has also proposed reforms
 to the law on procurement (Ley de Adquisiciones y Contrataciones de la Administracidn Pliblica -
 LACAP) and the establishment of a new law on access to information (Ley de Acceso a la Informacidn
 Pliblica).

51.    The cost of the Anti-Crisis Plan i s about US$560 million to be implemented over 2009 and
 2010. The Government has already secured financing for about 60 percent o f the cost o f the plan and i s
 exploring options to finance the remainder. About US$205 million (1 percent of GDP3)i s expected to
 be spent in 2009, and if financing i s found for the whole program, the 2010 budget for the Anti-Crisis
 Plan w i l l amount to about US$355 million. The budget for the Anti-Crisis Plan w i l l be submitted to the
 Assembly in the form o f an Extraordinary Budget for Social Investment (Proyecto de Decreto
 conteniendo las Reformas a Presupuesto Extraordinario de Inversidn Social - PEIS).
                              1

52.     The overwhelming share of the proposed expenditure i s on social programs and i s intended
 to cushion the impacts of the crisis on the poor, while preparing the framework for a system of
 social protection. A large share o f the spending goes towards the Comunidades Solidarias (including
 expenditure on vivienda social and basic pension) and another important component towards the
 provision o f uniforms, school supplies and school meals for children from pre-school level to grade 9.
 Another significant expenditure w i l l be for expanding health and nutrition services and reducing barriers
 to health services consumption, through the elimination o f the co-payments and the supply of essential
 medicines. Most o f the programs w i l l be included as part of the Universal System o f Social Protection,
 subject to the evaluation o f their costs and results, which the STP intends to conduct o n a regular basis.
 For example, the Government intends to evaluate the expansion o f the school feeding program and the
 supply o f free uniforms to school children, as the costs o f both programs are substantial. The Temporary
 Income Support Program, on the other hand, w i l l be phased out after 18 to 24 months, when the most
 severe effects o f the crisis are expected to have passed.




  Nominal GDP in 2009 i s estimated to be US$ 22.1 billion by IMF and MOF.

                   Iv.BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S STRATEGY


A. LINK TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY (CPS)

53.     The CPS, presented in parallel with the SSGER DPL, covers the fiscal years 2010-2012 and
 comes at the beginning of a new political cycle for El Salvador. The CPS provides support to the
 Government's program, including i t s Anti-Crisis Plan to address fiscal challenges, focus priority
 spending and set the stage for a strong recovery. The strategic guiding principle o f the CPS i s to balance
 the immediate response to the economic and social aspects o f the crisis, while also addressing the
 longer-tern development challenges - a principle that i s also being applied within this one-tranche
 SSGER DPL which has been an important entry point to establish a dialogue on medium-term policy
 actions. The strategic objectives o f the CPS are specifically to: (i)   address macro and institutional
                   i)
 vulnerabilities; ( i mitigate the social impact o f the crisis and support the social sectors; and ( i )  ii
 strengthen prospects for economic recovery. This one-tranche DPL, which i s included in the CPS,
 supports these objectives and specifically helps close the 2009 fiscal gap while protecting social
 expenditures and supporting policy actions in education, health and social protection sectors to protect
 the most vulnerable.

B. COLLABORATION W I T H THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

54.     The Bank has been collaborating very closely with the IMF and the Inter-American
 Development Bank during the preparation of this operation. This collaboration began with the
 efforts to engage with the new administration. A workshop was organized jointly b y the Bank and the
 IDB and IMF in M a y 2009, before the new government took office in order to discuss possible areas of
 support. These coordination efforts have continued since then. Consultation with the IMF has been
 particularly close in the context o f preparing the review o f macroeconomic development and in the
 update o f the Debt Sustainability Analysis. Moreover, the proposed DPL program i s consistent with
 IMF policy advice to the Government regarding how to address the fiscal imbalances that have emerged
 during 2009. The IDB and the Bank are coordinating their support for the Government's program,
 through budget support and investment operations supporting the CSU program and the social
 protection agenda.

C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

55.     The proposed SSGER DPL i s accompanied by parallel and mutually reinforcing operations.
 In particular, i t builds on the ongoing Public Finance and Social Sector DPL (Ln.76350-SV), which
 supports the reduction and subsequent elimination o f the electricity subsidy, by focusing o n one o f the
 largest remaining subsidies, public transport. The f i r s t tranche o f t h i s US$450 million operation was
 released on effectiveness in February 2009, and the Government i s o n track to meet the second tranche
 conditions in early 201 1. The mtblic Finance and Social Sector DPL also supports improvements in the
 social protection and education sectors, in particular, expansion o f the Conditional Cash Transfer
 Program, Red Solidaria, and improving the coverage and quality o f secondary education. The proposed
 SSGER DPL complements these actions b y protecting critical expenditures in the social sectors,
 expanding the school feeding program and laying the foundations for better institutional capacity in the
 social sector line ministries.

56.    The Government has made significant progress with the conditions of the Public Finance
 and Social Sector Development Policy Loan and the Bank i s working with the Government to
 ensure that problems are highlightedahead of time and corrective actions implemented (Table 4).
 The only condition related to education i s being discussed with the new Government, given that i t i s in

                                                     15
 the process o f reassessing the country's education strategy, including programs such as EDUCAME. To
 the extent that there are important shifts in the country's strategy the fulfillment o f this condition i s
 uncertain. However, the Government i s trying to secure the required resources for this action in the
 2010 budget.

57.    In addition, the Government and the Bank are preparing a new investment operation, El
 Salvador Social Protection: Income Support and Employability Project (US$50 million -
 P117440), which will support the design and implementation of the temporary income program
 set up under the SSGER DPL. This new investment project w i l l also strengthen the institutional and
 policy capacity o f the Government to develop inclusive social policies especially on social protection

                                                           16
 and employment dimensions. Finally, SSGER i s also closely linked to the upcoming US$20 million
 technical assistance project on Fiscal Management and Public Sector Performance (PO953 14), which
 w i l l support capacity development in line ministries, thus building on the institutional capacity pillar o f
 the proposed SSGER DPL.

D. LESSONS LEARNED

58.     One of the key lessons reflected in the CAS Completion Report i s the importance of
 consensus-building efforts to ensure successful implementation of the program in a politically
 polarized environment. The process followed in the preparation of this DPL builds on the successful
 experience o f the Public Finance and Social Sector DPL, which was discussed and agreed with the main
 political parties, as approval o f loans with a sovereign guarantee requires a two-thirds congressional
 majority. Moreover, during the consultation process with Government, legislature and other
 stakeholders, i t was suggested that presenting to Congress a package o f loans, rather than single loans,
 would facilitate the approval process. As a result, this DPL would be accompanied by a CPS and other
 operations,

59.     The CAS Completion Report also finds analytical work to be an extremely important tool to
 identify gaps in specific sectors, inform stakeholders, build consensus around important
 development issues and prepare the groundwork for future engagement in areas of mutual
 interest. Experience in El Salvador has shown that the Government greatly values the range o f global
 expertise the Bank can bring to complex development issues. The extensive analytical work o f the last
 12 months to prepare Policy Notes on Education, Health and Social Protection sectors and an ongoing
 Public Expenditure Review underpins the proposed DPL.

60.     Additional lessons from good practice have been elaborated in Box 1.




                                                      17
                               Box 1. Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

       Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership. The operation supports the Government's request to assist El Salvador
 during the financial turmoil and global economic slowdown. This operation supports specific programs and areas
 which are reflected in the Government's Anti-Crisis Plan. The administration, although new has been working
 closely with both political parties to ensure support for this operation. The focus areas for the SSGER D P L were
  selected through sustained policy dialogue, based on extensive analytical work, which began with a two-day
 meeting (Encerrona ) in early M a y 2009 between the multilateral agencies and the transition team o f the new
 Government, before the new administration formally assumed power.
       Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and otherfinancialpartners on a coordinated
 accountabilityframework. The Bank's support i s summarized in a brief and focused policy matrix, agreed with
 the Government, which provides the accountability framework for the operation. The DPL i s consistent with the
 IMF's policy advice.
       Principle 3: Customize the accountabilityframework and modalities o Bank support to country
                                                                                    f
 circumstances. The Ministry o f Finance has indicated that i t intends to fill i t s multilateral "budget support"
 needs through the proposed SSGER D P L operation, complementing the current DPL operation and the
 investment lending portfolio o f other donors and the Bank. The selected policy actions develop the ideas of the
  Government's social agenda and the Anti-Crisis Plan and are based on the work being done in the technical line
 Ministries and agencies. Accordingly, the specific actions and intended outcomes enjoy technical and political
  support in their respective sectors. The relevance and soundness o f said actions have been assessed through the
 Bank's analytical work and follow-up activities.
       Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement.The prior
  actions form part o f an agreed accountability framework that focuses on the Government's critical actions for
  achieving the program objectives. The operation supports three complementary policy areas and the policy
 matrix has been limited to a number o f actions considered necessary to maintain coherence o f policy dialogue
  and benefit from complementarities toward the intended outcomes.
       Principle 5: Conduct transparentprogress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
 financial support. The approach and the timing o f the planned disbursement respond to the Government's stated
 financial needs. The MOF w i l l exercise leadership in coordinating the monitoring and evaluation o f the
  arrangements.


E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

61.     The actions supported by the DPL have been assessed through the analytical work of the
 Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. In addition, prior work done b y the Bank on
 education and health in Central America also highlights the main policy issues and provides
 recommendations. The substantial body o f work has provided the basis for an in-depth dialogue with the
 new administration and has supported the design o f the DPL. Table 5 shows the links between the prior
 actions in the DPL and the recommendations included in recent analytical work.

                             adverse effects o n the country's fiscal position. In general, poor
                             households in El Salvador have less access to services, consume less,
                             and therefore benefit less from the existing subsidies. Reducing
                             subsidies i s therefore likely to generate fiscal space for social
                             expenditures without worsening the position o f the poor.

A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

62.     The SSGER DPL i s designed as a single tranche operation to support the Government's
 Anti-Crisis Plan and elaboration of its medium-term development agenda, and will serve as a
 bridge between the ongoing DPL and a possible programmatic DPL series in F Y l l and FY12. As
 described in paragraph 55, the proposed operation complements and builds upon the ongoing Public
 Finance and Social Sector DPL (Ln.76350-SV) b y helping the Government to reduce or re-target main
 public subsidies. At the same time, the proposed SSGER would serve as a stepping stone towards a
 future programmatic DPL series which the Government has requested and, subject to the availability o f
 IBRD funds, the Bank intends to support. A single tranche operation i s an appropriate instrument to
 address the immediate needs o f the Government's Plan while the new administration completes the
 preparation of i t s medium-term development strategy. The policy and institutional framework supported
 b y the SSGER DPL w i l l also enable the Bank to provide the policy guidance and advice that the
 Government has sought.

63.     The SSGER DPL i s constructed around three pillars, drawn from the most important
 elements of the Government's general program and its Anti-Crisis Plan in particular, that will
 protect the social gains made in the past decade and reinforce the framework for economic
 recovery. These three pillars are: (i)                                                         i)
                                           protecting fiscal space for social expenditures; ( i protecting
 income and consumption o f the vulnerable population; and ( i ) i istrengthening the institutional capacity
 for policy formulation and implementation in the social sectors for economic recovery. While the
 Government's Anti-Crisis Plan i s wide-ranging, the SSGER DPL selectiveIy supports specific and
 critical policy actions, focusing on those with the greatest immediate impact on the poor and vulnerable
 sections and institutional strengthening.

64.    A negotiated policy matrix i s attached in Annex 2 and includes prior actions for the SSGER
 DPL. These actions and baseline as well as target values o f the expected outcome indicators were
 discussed and agreed during the preparation o f the operation with the Government, including the
 Ministry o f Finance and sectoral Ministries/agencies.

B. K E Y POLICY AREAS

        -
Pillar 1 Protecting fiscal space for social expenditures.

65.     In El Salvador, as in other countries, subsidies constitute an important part of social
 spending. The most important subsidies are for electricity, liquid petroleum gas, transport and water. In
 2008, subsidies to basic services cost US$420 million (about 2 percent o f GDP), compared to spending
 in health in education, which was US$365 million (1.65 percent o f GDP) and US$635 million (2.87
 percent o f GDP), respectively. Although subsidies are not the best way to address equity issues, their
 complete elimination in the absence o f well-developed safety nets would have negative consequences
 for the welfare o f the poor. This i s all the more so in a situation o f economic crisis, when the poor face
 downward pressures on their incomes.

66.     Nonetheless, the Government i s committed to reform the system of untargeted subsidies,
 continuing the program initiated under the Public Finance and Social Sector DPL (Ln.76350-SV)
 with the previous Government. Under this operation, as a prior action for the release o f the first
 tranche, the previous Government reduced electricity subsidy for firms. The elimination o f t h i s subsidy
 for firms, which i s expected to yield savings of 0.4 percent o f GDP, i s a prior action for the release o f
 the second tranche. Prior to coming to power, the current Government agreed to these actions. This was
 later confirmed when the current administration included the reduction o f the cost o f subsidies as a
 critical element o f the Anti-Crisis Plan.

                                                     21
67.     The SSGER DPL extends the policy framework of the Public Finance and Social Sector
 DPL by supporting further actions to reduce the cost of another untargeted subsidy and releasing
 fiscal space for protecting critical expenditures in the social sectors. This operation focuses on the
 reduction o f the cost o f the transport subsidy. I t also contributes to the medium-term outcomes o f the
 Public Finance and Social Sector DPL, namely, the reduction o f untargeted public subsidies b y 40
 percent in 201l(with respect to 2008).

    Policy area l a : Reduction of the public transportation subsidy

68.     The current public subsidy to urban and inter-city passenger transport i s poorly targeted
 and costly. This subsidy was established in November 2007 to stabilize the price o f public
 transportation, which would have otherwise increased as a result o f the rising petrol prices. Since i t s
 implementation, the monthly lump-sum transfer paid to registered buses and microbuses, although not
 directly tied to changes in diesel prices, has increased with the increasing prices. For instance, in July
 2008, after o i l prices rose sharply, the Government doubled the subsidy to US$800 for buses and
 US$400 for microbuses and i t remained at this level even though diesel prices started declining from
 September 2008. Funding for this subsidy i s partly based on taxes o f US$O.lO per gallon o f diesel and
                                                                          However, because the subsidy i s so
 gasoline. The current subsidy has an annual cost o f US$ 84 m i l l i ~ n . ~
 poorly targeted, the benefits rarely protect vulnerable households. The subsidy does not consider the
 number o f passengers being transported, the distance traveled, diesel consumed or access to transport,
 which i s actually less in urban areas than in rural areas.'

69.     Prior action: The Government has reduced the Public Transportation Subsidy by means of
 a legislative decree, effective August 1, 2009. In July 2009, the Government originally proposed the
 elimination o f the transport subsidy; however, as a first step, the Government negotiated with the bus
 operators to lower the subsidy to US$500a month for buses and US$250 a month for microbuses, which
 equates to around 38 percent from i t s current level o f US$84 million a year. The reduced tariff w i l l last
 18 months, at which point the Government w i l l revisit the subsidy. The complete elimination could not
 be done this year without raising tariffs for consumers.

70.        Over the medium term, the GOES intends to review and rationalize the transport subsidy,
 including the option of completely eliminating it and thereby saving an additional US$50 million
 every year. The administrative costs o f supervising the implementation o f the subsidy are high relative
 to the benefits. Regulations require that vehicles operate 25 days a month and make 7 daily trips, and i t
 i s difficult to ensure compliance with over 12,000 buses and microbuses.

    Policy area lb: Protect critical non-personnel recurrent expenditures in the social sectors and
    critical investments in the health sector

71.     The quality of education and health services is likely to deteriorate unless expenditures on
 educational supplies, medicines, laboratory materials, and other equipment are maintained.
 Evidence from previous crises indicates that cutbacks in these expenditures,' due to the rigidity o f
 personnel expenditures, has a long-term impact on educational quality and a more immediate impact on
 health outcomes (for instance, reduced vaccinations, preventive and curative services due to lack o f
 medicines or laboratory tests). In the case of education, non-personnel expenditures also include
 transfers to community schools (EDUCO) for paying teachers' salaries. Protecting these expenditures
 therefore ensures the continuation o f education services to poor and rural areas where EDUCO operates.

 Further, i t i s necessary to protect investments in the health sector to ensure the availability o f medicines
 at hospitalsklinics in rural areas where the population continues to be without critical medical services.

72.       Prior Action: The Government has: (a) maintained non-personnel recurrent expenditures
 in i t s education and health sectors for fiscal years 2009 and 2010, at least at fiscal year 2008 levels;
 (b) ensured that critical investment expenditure contemplated for hospitals in its Draft General
 Budget 2010 represents at least 39 percent of the investments budgeted for hospitals in its General
 Budget 2009; and (c) executed, by August 31,2009,48% of the 2009 investment budget for public
 hospitals. The execution rate o f the non-personnel recurrent and the investment budget as o f August
 31, 2009 reflects the protection o f the budget in 2009. For 2010, the Government w i l l protect these
 resources through the draft Decree which reforms the Extraordinary Program o f Social Investments for
 2009-2011 and the Draft General Budget for 2010 to be presented to the Legislative Assembly (See
 Annex 5).

73.     While these short-term measures are appropriate in the current critical situation, the
 Government i s conscious of the need to incorporate medium-term planning and budgeting
 framework in the sectoral Ministries. While sector strategies have been prepared (or are under
 preparation), they do not present the costs broken down by investment and recurrent expenditure. The
 criteria for making the necessary trade-offs and prioritization have also to be developed. The proposed
 El Salvador Fiscal Management and Public Sector Performance Technical Assistance Loan, which i s
 also being concurrently presented to the Board, w i l l provide assistance to develop a multi-annual
 framework for the budget.

Pillar 2 - Protecting income and consumption of the vulnerable population

                                 f
      Policy area 2a: Expansion o School Feeding program to urban pre-schools and basic schools

74.      School feeding programs have proven to be successful in increasing school attendance and
 the students' ability to concentrate in class. These are important and necessary to increase access to
 public education, particularly in times o f economic crisis. The private costs o f schooling are cited as an
 important reason for non-attendance and completion in El Salvador and the Government intends to
 provide free textbooks and uniforms, in addition to free school meals. In 2008, the GOESassumed the
 full responsibility o f the financing o f the school feeding program, originally financed by the World Food
 Programme. As o f June 2009, the school feeding program reached nearly 876,500 students from pre-
 school to the end o f basic education (end o f grade 9) in rural areas (all school centers with the adequate
 facilities for storage and preparing meals are eligible).

75.       Prior Action: As of August 31, 2009, the Government has expanded the School Feeding
 Program to cover additional 764 public schools and 452,800 more students between preschool
 (ages 4-6 years) and the end of basic education (1S'-9th    grade), compared to a baseline of 857,400
 students as of 30 June 2009. The expansion o f the program began in August 2009 and the total
 coverage i s expected to reach 1.3 million students, or an additional half a million students (the program
 w i l l continue to grow slightly in 2010 to include some schools in urban areas, which could not be
 included this year). The program with the expansion for the last third o f the school-year 2009 i s
 expected to cost US$27.9 million in 2010.

76.     Over the medium term, the Government will evaluate the benefits of continuing a universal
 School Feeding Program with significant budgetary costs. The STP, which i s in charge o f the Anti-
 Crisis Plan, intends to carry out this evaluation at the end o f the two years.




                                                     23
    Policy area 2b: Ensuring access to health servicesfor the poor

77.     The system of co-payments (cuotas voluntarius) in public health institutions (medical centers
 and hospitals) was meant to provide them with additional funds to purchase essential medicines,
 supplies and maintenance in prompt and timely basis. Receipts from patients were retained by the
 centers and hospitals and did not accrue to the general revenues o f the Government. Although the
 revenue from this cost recovery has not been substantial relative to the total budget o f the MSPAS
 (approximately US$10.1 million for 2008, or less than 5 percent o f the Ministry's budget), there i s
 strong evidence that the co-payments had a negative impact in the utilization o f health services by the
 poor due to the absence of a targeting scheme in the health centers. Even prior to the economic crisis,
 payments in public health facilities prevented about one-quarter o f the poor and one-third o f the extreme
 poor from seeking health care when they were sick. According to household survey data for 2007,
 households spent on average US$90 per capita during the year. Although these expenditures include
 those on private health clinics and medicines, co-payments constitute a significant proportion o f private
 expenditure. For a single episode requiring attention in a hospital, an individual could end up paying
 US$40 in public hospitals. In an economic downturn, these payments w i l l further lower the demand for
 health services b y the poor.

78.     The Ministry of Health abolished these co-payments in June 2009 through an instruction to
 the health establishments. Every hospital and health center prepared an action plan for the year and
 estimated the amount that would have been collected from voluntary co-payments. This information was
 utilized b y the MSPAS to estimate the loss o f revenues o f those centers and to request additional budget
 from the Ministry o f Finance to maintain the quality o f services.

79.      Prior action: The Government has eliminated existing co-payments for services offered by
 public health facilities and has provided supplemental funds to the M S P A S to compensate fully
 for the resulting loss of revenue. The Government w i l l issue: (i)Decree to prohibit the levying o f
                                                                        a
 these copayments by any type o f medical establishment under the MSPAS and ( ia Decree modifying
                                                                                      i)
 the Reglamento General de Hospitales del MSPAS, to forbid the copayments. To compensate for this
 loss o f revenue to the public health system, b y August 31, 2009, the Ministry o f Finance has authorized
 to transfer around US$3.1 million to the MSPAS. For 2010, the M O F w i l l transfer about US$10 million
 to the extraordinary budget o f the MSPAS, through a specific line item called "compensation to fees
 paid by patients."

80.     This measure will lower barriers to utilization of public health services by the poor and
 raise demand. The MSPAS anticipates a 30 percent rise in demand for public health services and a 10
 percent increase in hospital discharges, which w i l l be partly met b y the six new and rehabilitated rural
 hospitals funded b y the Bank (Earthquake Emergency and Reconstruction and Health Services
 Extension Project (Ln.76350-SV) that w i l l become operational in 2010.

81.     However, over the medium term, additional policy measures on financing are required to
 sustain quality and forestall the rise of informal, unregulated payments. Experience shows that
 unless a viable system o f financing i s put in place for hospitals and medical centers, the lack o f
 resources generates perverse incentives. Over the medium term, the MSPAS will need to generate
 additional resources through improving management efficiency and protecting budget o f essential
 expenditures such as medicines, medical supplies and maintenance o f medical equipment in hospital
 networks.

                                      f
   Policy area 2c: Protecting income o the poor

82.    The economic crisis has hit the country in several ways. During the f i r s t five months o f 2009,
 exports shrank b y 16 percent. A steep fall in remittances in 2008 and 2009 has increased income
 vulnerability due to the high level o f dependence on these transfers. Job losses have been substantial.

                                                    24
 Between September 2008 and April 2009, more than 30,000 formal jobs were lost and this number may
 reach 90,000 by the end o f 2009.

83.      This situation has affected the urban population disproportionately, in particular the youth,
 as well as women. In 2007, young people (between 15 and 24 years o f age) made up 20 percent of the
 overall population and 32 percent o f the working-age population (ages 15-65 years). Around 63 percent
 o f the youth live in urban areas (28 percent in San Salvador). However, less than 25 percent of youth
 between 20 and 30 years o f age had access to formal salaried employment. Unemployment incidence
                                                                           n
 and duration remain greatest among those with less than basic education.6 I the context o f the crisis, the
 number of unemployed young people i s expected to increase by 2-3 percentage points, representing
 roughly 15,000 additional young people each year. The crisis has also generated unemployment among
 urban women who constituted most o f the workforce o f the export-oriented maquilas.

84.     Rising youth unemployment i s likely to contribute to violence and risky behaviors, which
 are already having a profoundly negative impact on the society. El Salvador has the highest
 homicide rate among young people (176 cases per 100,000 young male population- data from 2005) in
 Latin America and the highest teenage pregnancy rates (around 14 percent o f Salvadoran females report
 an early birth- women aged 15-19 aged years- data from 2006).

85.       I n response, the Government has prepared a program of income support through
 temporary employment in the poorest urban communities, as part of the Comunidades Solidarias
 Urbanas. The Temporary Income Support Program (Program de Apoyo Temporal a1 Zngreso - PATI)
 i s a flagship program o f the Government, which was launched in 2 municipalities in September 2009.
 The program i s part o f the CSU, which aims to promote an integrated development o f extremely poor
 urban areas to improve the living conditions and create opportunities for growth o f individuals, families
 and communities (see paragraph 45). The main objectives o f the PATI are to: (i)          provide income
 support to the poor and unemployed population, in particular youth and women ( i augment human
                                                                                         i)
                                           i i strengthen the role o f the municipalities in designing and
 capital development through training; ( i )
 delivering the program; and (iv) encourage participatory processes in selection o f beneficiaries and
 monitoring o f implementation. The criteria for selection give preference to new entrants into the labor
 market, those who have recently lost jobs, and women. Intended as a temporary program, i t i s expected
 to last two years, up to early 2012.

86.     The Temporary Income Support Program marks a departure from traditional social
 assistance and public works programs and involves the coordination of several institutional actors
 to meet program objectives. The design elements include appropriate targeting, criteria for selection of
 beneficiaries, capacity development o f municipalities and other actors, funds flow and monitoring and
 evaluation. The program design uses a two-stage targeting mechanism. At the first stage, the poorest
 municipalities are selected based on a poverty map. At the second stage, the targeting o f eligible
 beneficiaries i s mainly through self-selection, by setting the wage at about the minimum wage level in
 rural areas. A minimum education qualification level o f 9 years o f schooling i s set in order not to create
 incentives for dropping out from school. Those who have not completed 9 years o f schooling w i l l need
 to go through the non-formal education called EDUCAME. Selected beneficiaries have to participate in
 community projects and training to receive income support. The design i s intended to deliver income
 support to the poor more rapidly than traditional public works program for creating infrastructure. A
 welcome feature o f the design i s the inclusion o f the training component which ensures that, unlike
 other simple emergency workfare programs, there i s medium and long-term investment in building
 human capital. Further, the training combines training in generic, transversal s k i l l s as well as job
 specific skills. The program expects to cover about 40,000 beneficiaries in 43 municipalities, covering
 35 percent o f those households living under extremely precarious conditions in those municipalities.

87.     The delivery of the program, as part of the CSU, requires a legal framework to secure
 coordination across agencies and Ministries of the Government and with municipalities. The
 legal framework lays out the responsibilities o f the STP, as overall coordinator o f the program, the
 FISDL as the main implementing agency and the municipalities as partners.



                                  Box 2 - The Temporary Income Support Program
      What the program jnances: Temporary income support (PATI) to the vulnerable population in urban areas, in
      exchange for their participation in training and community service activities.
      Types o activities: Social and community services such as childcare, sports and youth activities, improvement of
                 f
      public spaces; and specific training modules to enhance employability o f participants.
      Targeted municipalities: Large municipalities with high concentration o f urban poor communities
      (asentamientos). Selected using the criteria o f the urban poverty map o f UNDP and violence indicators.
      Eligible beneficiaries: Urban poor - particularly youth and women, especially female household heads that may
      be disproportionately affected by the economic slowdown.
      Amount of payment per benejciary: US$lOO per month, totaling US$600 at the end o f six months. This wage
      level w i l l promote self-selection o f the poor.
      Implementation mechanism: The program w i l l be executed by the Social Fund (Fond0 de Inversidn Social para el
      Desarrollo Local - FISDL) under the strategic coordination o f the STP. Municipalities from identified areas from
      the urban poverty map (UNDP, 2009) w i l l submit proposals for PATI activities supported, including nature of
      activities, duration, co-participation through material and tools, number o f participants, and type o f training.
      Design o f training packages would be required for all eligible activity proposals. Most training activities would be
      carried out through the network o f training institutions certified b y INSAFORP, the public sector institution
      which regulates and accredits technical training. Payment to beneficiaries would be centralized b y F I S D L through
      field verifications from the municipalities, while the training providers would be paid b y FISDL through
      INSAFORP.
      Monitoring and evaluation: The STP in coordination with FISDL w i l l monitor the program implementation and
      evaluate results in an articulated fashion with that M&E system being developed at the STP. An impact
      evaluation funded b y the Spanish Impact Evaluation Fund i s also planned.
      Participatory processes: All proposals to be prepared by Municipalities would respond to the demands from the
      community and the advice o f training experts. Municipalities, in coordination with local communities, w i l l decide
      on a l i s t o f eligible participants based on specific criteria for eligibility.
      Program phasing: The Government launched the program in two municipalities in September 2009, with
      expansion to 11-13 municipalities in March 2010 and 40 municipalities at the end o f 2 years.



88.    Prior action: The Government has established the program Comunidades Solidarias, of
 which the Temporary Income Support Program i s part of its urban intervention, and has set forth
 the legal and operational framework for i t s implementation. The program i s envisaged to come to an
 end in two years, but the lessons of the program w i l l serve to put in place income support mechanisms
 in the future. Over the medium term, municipalities are expected to have capacity to initiate local
 development and social protection programs.

Pillar 3 Strengthening institutional capacity for policy formulation and implementation in the
social sectors for economic recovery

      Policy area 3a: Strengthening institutional capacity and policy-making in the Ministry of
      Education

89.     Construction of policies for the long-term economic and social development of the country
 i s one of the Government's top priorities. The Government has launched important initiatives,
 including the creation o f an Economic and Social Council, to initiate a national dialogue for the


                                                            26
  development o f a medium term strategy o f development. Consultations with business and civil society
  have begun on a regular basis, led b y the STP. Line Ministries are undertaking re-organizations to
  improve their ability to design and implement medium and long-term policies. The SSGER DPL w i l l
  focus on actions that are critical for strengthening institutional capacity in education, health, and social
  protection.

90.     Education: The MINED'S   new organizational structure supports its emphasis on improving
 quality, giving a prominent role to the development of science and technology education and
 research, and encouraging decentralization. In undertaking this re-organization, the Ministry w i l l
 make maximum use o f existing capacity and knowledge o f the personnel and technical teams already in
 place, while re-assigning personnel where necessary in line with the new structure. Specifically, i t
 focuses on:

             creating posts o f Vice-Minister for general education and Vice-Minister for science and
             technology (the latter has a transversal responsibility across levels of education), identifying
             areas under the direct responsibilities o f the Vice-Ministers, assigning corresponding units to
             each Vice-ministry according to the new academic, technological, and cultural emphasis
             supported b y the GOES'S  education policy;

            strengthening and redefining the role o f the Central Directorates o f the Ministry in key areas
            essential to adequately inform and support decision-making and policy guidance such as: (i)
            planning (strategic planning, project and external cooperation, monitoring and evaluation and
                          i)
            statistics); ( ilegal advice; ( i internal audit and (iv) communication;
                                           ii )

            decentralizing to the Education Departmental Directorates (Directores Departamentales de
            Educacidn - DDEs) the functions related to pedagogical support, monitoring o f quality and
            student learning achievements, as well as regular administrative and management tasks

91.       Prior Action: The Government has created a Vice-Ministry for Science and Technology
 within the Ministry of Education. The following six key strategic lines have been identified by the
 Vice-Ministry over the 2009-14 period to upgrade the quality o f science and technology education in
 line with international standards: (i) update and increase the availability o f computers and access to
                                        to
 internet in all education centers in the public sector; ( ito strengthen the competencies and s k i l l s o f
                                                            i)
 school directors and teachers alike in pedagogical use o f information and communication technologies;
    i ito
 ( i ) develop and expand the equipping o f scientific laboratories in the education centers in the public
 sector; (iv) to strengthen and expand programs for the training o f talented youth to support the country's
 scientific and technological developments; (v) to adapt the curriculum for technical education in upper
 secondary and higher education to develop professional competencies and skills, to meet the needs o f
 the productive sectors and the future development o f El Salvador; and (vi) to promote and support
 scientific investigation in higher education to contribute to knowledge generation. The Government also
 proposes to create a Fund for Innovation and Technological Development, which will promote alliances
 between different stakeholders in the innovation and research system o f the country.

92.     One significant expected outcome of this institutional strengthening i s an assessment of the
 relevance and quality of science and technology curriculum and teaching, specifically at the
 secondary education level, which i s a priority of the Vice-Ministry. Based on the findings and
 recommendations of t h i s assessment, new content for the teaching o f science and technology and pilot
 programs for the retraining o f teachers in science and technology w i l l be developed in 2010. The
 introduction o f other policy measures requires careful prioritization and further detailing o f the strategic
 plan in order to ensure that scarce resources are used efficiently. Over the medium term, the
 Government intends to launch the implementation o f the reform o f science curriculum in secondary
 schools.


                                                     27
   Policy area 3b: Strengthening institutional capacity and policy-making in the Ministry o Health
                                                                                           f

93.     Health: Extending basic health care services to all sections of the population is a policy
 priority of the government. This has been done through the implementation o f various programs
 aimed at providing basic health care services to poor and isolated rural populations, especially women
 and children. Since 2005, the MSPAS embarked on an innovative approach using two different
 strategies o f extension o f coverage: (i)contracting o f NGOs to deliver the basic health and nutrition
 package in coordination with the MSPAS health units and (ii)      public-public contracting, commonly
 known as institutional strengthening o f MSPAS health units, to deliver the basic health and nutrition
 package through mobile teams comprising public personnel. T o date, over 650,000 people have
 benefitted under this program in the North and Oriental regions in 59 municipalities in the poorest areas
 o f El Salvador. The provision o f these services was financed under the Bank's project Earthquake
 Emergency and Reconstruction and Health Services Extension Project (Ln.70840-SV). Since 2009, the
 GOEShas financed this strategy with i t s own funds.

94.      The MSPAS intends to continue these efforts to ensure coverage of this population through
 the creation of an integrated network of health care services, which will also address the
 fragmentation in the health sector, based on an Integrated Health Care Model. The MSPAS aims
 to form a network between the various service providers and various forms o f insurance mechanisms in
 order to extend coverage o f health services to all individuals. The MSPAS has acknowledged the
 effectiveness of the contracting o f NGOs to deliver health care services in a context of limited public
 networks in the rural and remote areas. However, i t also considers i t necessary to include both public
 health centers and NGOs to deliver services in rural and remote areas in order to promote efficiency at
 the health center level. The MSPAS proposes to consolidate all the experiences o f rural health services
 coverage through an Integrated Health Care Model (Modelo de atencio'n integral de salud, MAIS). The
 integrated health care model i s an approach to provide continuous health care to the population with
 special focus on the family health, and i s based on a collaborative care approach involving health
 services and community participation. I t consists o f the provision o f health care directed to the
 individual and family health, rather than to specific health intervention or illness.

95.     Prior Action: The Government has created a Vice Ministry of Health Sector Policy and a
 Vice-Ministry of Health Care Services within the MSPAS. In particular, the Vice Ministry o f Health
 Sector Policy w i l l strengthen the design, implementation, and oversight o f health care policies,
 including the development and definition o f the Integrated Health Care Model. The Vice Ministry o f
 Health Care Services w i l l focus on improving the quality and access o f health care services through the
 creation o f the network o f integrated health care services including prevention, promotion and general
 health care.

96.    One expected outcome of this institutional strengthening i s the expansion of the coverage of
 health services through the Integrated Health Care Model for poor people in the 80 poorest
 municipalities. This will require the MSPAS to continuously monitor the provision o f health services
 through the networks of public and non-government health providers.

   Policy Area 3c: Strengthening institutional capacity for policy planning in social protection

97.      Social Protection: The design of the Universal System of Social Protection i s a core policy
 objective of the Government. The SPSU envisages coordination in the provision o f a variety o f social
 services for an integral development o f families and communities through a partnership between the
 state, the municipal governments, the labor market, and the community. Specifically for the population
 living in extreme poverty and social exclusion, the Government proposes to create the program o f
 Comunidades Solidarias. In rural areas, the program w i l l build on the experience o f Red Solidaria, the
 Conditional Cash Transfer program. However, for urban areas, the program needs to be designed. T w o
 key instruments in the design of the SPSU w i l l be the creation o f a Registry of Beneficiaries in order to

                                                     28
 coordinate social programs and optimize the use o f resources as well and a sound system o f monitoring
 and evaluation to assess the efficacy o f interventions.

98.     Prior Action: The Government has re-organized the STP to coordinate social policies. The
 STP has been given the mandate for social policy planning for coordination across social sector
 Ministries. This w i l l be supported by the design o f technical instruments and capacity development o f
 staff responsible for designing, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating social policies. This capacity
 development w i l l be supported by the Bank's El Salvador Social Protection: Income Support and
 Employability Project (P117440).

99.     A n expected outcome of t h i s is the piloting of the CSU in two municipalities. The
 implementation o f the pilot would reflect the ability o f the STP to conduct analysis of the factors
 leading to urban poverty and the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation o f coordinated
 multi-sectoral interventions.

100. The following table summarizes the links between policy actions supported by the SSGER
 DPL, their outcomes, the medium-term Government program and the CPS target outcomes (see
 Table 6).

                                 VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

101. The proposed operation i s expected to have significant positive distributional effects by
 supporting the Government's efforts to protect social spending levels with a special focus on the
 most vulnerable population. Pro-poor actions in the social sector, including protecting incomes o f the
 poor, eliminating health co-payments, and implementing school feeding programs, are specifically
 designed to promote poverty reduction or at the very least prevent deterioration during the crisis. Recent
 analytical work, including the ongoing PER and Policy Notes in Education, Health, and Social
 Protection suggest that the distributional impacts o f some o f the above actions supported b y this DPL
 w i l l be positive. In addition, since the reduction o f the transport subsidy w i l l not lead to higher tariffs
 for consumers, this measure w i l l not have any immediate social effects. In the medium term, options for
 reforming the subsidy regime in the transport sector w i l l need to take into account possible
 distributional effects o f these changes and include a public communication campaign to ensure their
 political and social sustainability.

B. CONSULTATIONS

102. The Government's program and the preparation of the SSGER DPL have been based on
 extensive consultations with political and civil society actors. Taking into account the political
 context, the background for Bank involvement, and the risks associated with the design o f this
 operation, the Government and the Bank have invested in a substantial consultation process with
 political actors, including the policy teams o f the FMLN and ARENA. In addition, discussions have
 been held with a wide range o f civil society organizations including think tanks, and private sector
 representatives. These discussions have covered the Government's Anti-Crisis Plan, the CPS, the
 proposed SSGER DPL, the proposed El Salvador Social Protection: Income Support and Employability
 Project, and the proposed El Salvador Fiscal Management and Public Sector Performance TA Project.
 Specific laws, institutional reforms, and programmatic actions supported b y these operations w i l l be
 discussed with different groups including the Consejo Econdmico y Social, which i s made up o f
 delegates from c i v i l society, the private sector, representatives from the Government, and the academic
 community. The proposed SSGER DPL w i l l be discussed with members o f Congress from both major
 political parties. The Bank Country Office has also established permanent communication mechanisms
 with such stakeholders and political players in order to make sure all parties are properly informed o f
 the objective and scope o f the operation and thus facilitate i t s domestic discussion and dissemination.

C. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

103. The specific actions supported under the proposed DPL are not likely to have significant
 positive or negative effects on the country's environment, forests, and other natural resources. In
 particular, measures to protect income and consumption o f the poor are not expected to have significant
 environmental effects, and since the reduction o f the transport subsidy w i l l be achieved without raising
 tariffs, i t i s not expected to have any environmental effects either.

D. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

104. The Ministry o f Finance (MOF) i s responsible for the implementation o f the DPL as well as for
 coordinating actions among the concerned line ministries/agencies including, in particular, the Central
 Bank, Ministry o f Education, Ministry o f Health, the Vice Ministry o f Transportation and the Technical
 Secretariat o f the Presidency. Together with the Ministry o f Finance, these ministries/agencies will
 collect the necessary data to assess implementation progress and report i t to the Bank, taking into



                                                       32
 account both process advances and service statistics, survey and other data that might be used to assess
 the achievement o f the program's end outcomes.

E. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

105.    El Salvador's fiduciary environment for DPLs i s adequate. As part o f the Government's
 overall long-term focus on public sector modernization, significant improvements in the performance o f
 budget and procurement management institutions have been made over the past one and a half decade.
 In April 2009, a PEFA assessment was completed with financing o f the European Commission and with
 participation o f the World Bank. The overall finding indicates that the general PFM environment i s
 solid, with a good performance in most o f the dimensions covered by the PEFA methodology, and the
 Government has completed successfully the PFM reform initiated ten years before. However, the report
 indicates that there are some shortcomings that affect the general efficiency o f the system and
 recommends a second generation of reforms for further strengthening o f the following areas: (i)      the
                                                            i)
 linkage between policy planning and budgeting and ( ithe auditing and external control mechanisms
 and credibility. In connection with this, and as part o f the El Salvador Public Finance and Social Sector
 DPL, the Bank i s engaged in public financial management dialogue with the Government to follow up
 on recommendations made through the C F A A and CPAR.

F. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

106. The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
 loans. The untied finances w i l l be disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the development
 policy program and not tied to any specific purchases. Once the loan credit i s approved by the Board
 and becomes effective, the proceeds o f the loan w i l l be deposited by IBRD in an account designated b y
 the Borrower and acceptable to the Bank at the Central Reserve Bank o f El Salvador at the request of
 the Borrower. The Borrower shall ensure that upon the deposit o f the Loan into said account, an
 equivalent amount i s credited in the Borrower's budget management system, in a manner acceptable to
 the Bank. The Borrower w i l l report to the Bank on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency
 account and credited to the budget management system. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such
 request shall be cancelled. The administration o f this loan w i l l be the responsibility o f the Ministry o f
 Finance.

107.   The Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador i s the financial agent of the Government. At the
 conclusion o f writing this project document, the latest IMF Safeguards Assessment performed in 2009 i s
 not available. However, the Central Bank publishes i t s Annual Financial Statements with an audit
 opinion provided by the Banking System Oversight Office (Superintendencia del Sistema Financiero).
 The opinion provided was clean for the last two years. Based on a review o f external audit reports,
 nothing came to the attention o f the Bank that would indicate that the banking control environment into
 which the loan proceeds w i l l flow i s other than adequate.

G. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

108.    The operation i s subject to two significant risks:

   a) Macroeconomic instability arising from fiscal pressures: Fiscal pressures are likely to emerge
      due to the sharp decline in current revenues associated with the economic slowdown. Tax
      collection i s expected to decline from 13.0 percent o f GDP in 2008 to 12.0 percent o f GDP in
      2009, and the fiscal deficit i s expected to reach 5.3 percent o f GDP in 2009 and 4.3 percent o f
      GDP in 2010. Even though the authorities have indicated their commitment to a lower fiscal
      deficit in 2010, t h i s could prove difficult if the crisis i s longer than anticipated or if the planned
      tax reform does not produce the expected results. Mitigation: The risk is partly mitigated through
      ensuring adherence to an acceptable macro-economic framework and continued policy dialogue

                                                      33
    with the Government to ensure that incremental expenditures are focused on the program's
    objectives o protecting the vulnerable population in an economic crisis. The Government has
                f
    also reached agreement on a new three-year Standby Arrangement with the IMF.

b) Opposition to approval o Bank loans in Congress: The operation supports specific programs
                             f
   and areas which are reflected in the Government's program and Anti-Crisis Plan. Although the
   new administration has been working closely to ensure support for this operation, the relationship
   could change with time. The administration does not have the required majority to approve Bank
   loans in the Congress. The approval process involves two votes by the Congress, requiring a
   simple majority in the first vote and a two-thirds majority in the second vote to approve the loan.
   In the past, the Congress did not approve several Bank projects, including those in the social
   sectors, leading to their cancellation. Mitigation: To mitigate this risk, the Bank has made
   sustained efforts to maintain dialogue with all parties, including opposition parties, on all aspects
   o the Government's program. The SSGER DPL is also being processed as part o a package
    f                                                                                      f
   including the new CPS and two investment projects supporting the Government's program.

                                                                    San Salvador, October 1,2009



Mr. Robert Zocllick
President
World Bank
Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Zocllick:

The Government o f President Carlos Mauricio Funes Caitagena i s requesting a US$lOO million
Development Policy Loan (DPL) from the World Bank to "Sustain Social Gains and Establish
the Foundations for Economic Recovery". These resources are being requested in order to
sustain the social gains made in the past and reinforce the Government's framework for
economic recovery.

This Policy Letter is structured in 5 sections with the objectives to: (i)
                                                                         provide a clear view o f El
Salvador's current economic and socio-economic situation; (ii) present the new Government's
policy agentla, refonns and Anti-Crisis Program; and (iii) the poiicy measures already taken in
the first four months of the new Administration with the overall goal o f seeking funding to
support thcsc initiatives during the current econoniic downturn.

Country Contest

Prior to the global financial crisis and economic recession, El Salvador's macroeconomic
fundamentals improved and several social indicators showed important advances. In addition,
notable economic, financial, and tax reforms were accompanied by an institutional
modernization process, which helped to position the country among the top countries in the
Central American and Latin American region in many categories and international indices
including the Index o f Global Competitiveness, the Doing Business Index, and the Index o f
Economic Frecdom.

Since 2008, however, higher food prices as well as record and volatile o i l prices in the
international inarket have severely impacted the Salvadoran economy. This price shock was
exacerbated by the international financial turmoil and the global econoniic slowdown. As a
result, El Salvador`s fiindamentals weakened. I n 2008, the economy slowed to a 2.5 percent real
grow rate, clown from 4.7 percent i n 2007, while the fiscal deficit rose from 1.9 percent o f GDP
in 2007 to 3.1 percent o f GDP and total debt rose to 39.7 percent o f GDP compared to 38.7
percent ot`GDI' in 2007.
The continued negative effects o f the global economic recession are reflected in the loss o f more
than 30,000 jobs, a 10 pcrcent drop in family remittances, a near 17 percent drop in exports, and
over 28 pcrcent drop in imports. Fui-thermore, though June 2009, the 12-monthmoving average

effects have impacted tax revenues, which are I 4 percent below target. I t i s estimated that by the
end o f 2009, tax reveilties will fall short of the budget by nearly $500 million -equivalent to 2.3
percent of GDP, broadening the fiscal deficit. Given the negative performance during the first
semester o f 2009, economic growth i s expected to decline 2.5 percent by year end.
The economic crisis i s also threatening the social gains achieved. I n fact, according to the
Multiple Purpose Household Survey, poverty levels rose from 34.5 percent in 2007 to 40.0
percent in 2008, while extreme poverty worsened, increasing from 10.8 percent to 12.4 percent.
In addition, and despite increased allocations for education, El Salvador's illiteracy rate for
population 10 years and older increased to 14.1 percent from 13.9 percent in 2007.

Govenimcat's Agentln

The 2009-2014 Government's Program i s concentrated in reducing poverty; the main priorities
include: improving social conditions, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable sectors o f
the population; regaining economic growth and fostering broad based and socially inclusive
economic development; promoting environmentally sustainable growth; and strengthening
democracy through an open and broad based dialogue to build consensus on political reforms.

I n the social arca, the Government aims to tackle povcrty by increasing allocations to education
and health programs. focusing on improving quality and access to such services. To date,
coiisidcrable advanccs have been ntade on the development o f the Universal Social Protection
System including the estension o f free education up to high school level, free health services,
and a solidarity pension for the elderly in some o f the poorest municipalities in the country. In
addition, the new Adminis!ration i s expanding thc former Rcd Solidaria Program, now called the
Coniunidades liurnles Solidarias to include the ConiunidadesUrbanas Solidarias.

 111 terms o f the economy, the Government aims to regain economic growth, taking advantage o f
 the current global economic recession to promote equitable and socially inclusive growth. In,
this regard, the Govcrnnient has begun to iinplement several initiatives to boost growth in
 agriculture and infrastiucture. Actions include a program to provide farmers with fertilizers to
 increase agricultural productivity, the housing programs known as "Piso y Techo" and "Vivienda
 para Todos", and the expansion o f credit to the private sector. The Government expects that
these programs will create an estimated 100,000 jobs over the nest three years, offsetting the
jobs loss during the current economic contraction.

To address the economic crisis and protect the most vulnerable sectors of the population, the
current Administration has developed an ambitious Anti-Crisis Program (ACP). The ACP's
objectives are: to protect employment and the most vulnerable population from the negative
impacts o f thc crisis; to implement the Universal Social Protection System; to strengthen public
finances; and to serve as a counter cyclical fiscal policy to regain economic growth and establish
the basis for a broad based and inclusive economic devcloprnent process. The ACP i s the first
major program announced by the new Administration and it builds on the Government's strong
social agenda.

The policies, programs and actions that will be supported by this $100 million DPL focus on
expanding thc liscal space through increased tax collections and enhanced expenditure




                                               36
manageinent. I t i s important to take iiito account that this Program builds upon the ongoing $450
million "Public Finance and Social Development Policy Loan" granted by the World Bank as
well as o n thc parallel $25 million "Strengthening Fiscal Management and Enhancing Public
Sector Expenditure Performance" project currently under formulation with the Bank. Areas that
will be supported by this DPL prograni will be explained in detail in sections 2, 3 and 4 o f this
Policy Letter.


Justification for Finnncing

As previously indicated, the current Administration has piit together an Anti-Crisis Program
designed to lessen the negative impacts o f thc economic crisis. This US$575.3 million Program
intends to protect the incomes o f the poorest and most vulnerable sectors of the population and
serve as a counter cyclical fiscal policy to stimulate the economy and lay down the foundations
for social inclusion policies which are at the core o f the new government`s agenda. The ACP
also considers ineastircs to strengthen the fiscal position and increase transparency and
accountability as a i n e m s to generate fiscal space to finance new social programs fostering a
more efficient use of public resources.

Even though the size o f the ACP should be proportionate to help offset the size o f impacts o f the
global economic recession, given fiscal limitations which have been further constrained by the
economic crisis, its total amount i s still important given the timeliness, temporality and the
programs included. Nonethcless, as indicated, there are important fiscal restrictions; i t i s
important t o mention that as o f today, 60 percent o f the cost o f the ProgrRm i s already funded by
internal efforts and reorientation o f existing external and internal resources,

Considering the urgency and importance o f the ACP, the government i s requesting the World
Bank i t s financial support to help close the current financing gap and help meet the needs of the
poorcst and most vulnerable sectors o f the population, thus helping sustain the social gains
achieved during recent years.

    1. Recent Econoniic and Social Developmeiits

During the last four years (2005-08), the economy grew at an annual average rate o f 3.8 percent,
much faster than in the previous four years (2000-04) when it grew at an annual rate o f 2.0
percent. This highcr expansion came in a period o f rapid global economic growth, and i t was
supported by a rapid increase in family remittances which averaged 17.9 percent o f GDP.
Furthermore, exports expanded at a 10.5 percent annual grow rate over the 2006-08. Growth
was also supportcd by a 9.6 percent annual increase in domestic credit, which averaged 40.2
percent o f GDP. Inllation, however, jumped to a nearly 5.0 percent annual average reflecting
higher petroleum priccs and the increase in basic foodstuffs.

The fiscal policy \vas also strengthened during this period as fiscal policy concentrated on
increasing the tax burden and keeping current expenditures under relative control. In fact, as a
result o f thc 2004 tax reform, El Salvador's tax intake increased from 12.0 percent o f GDP in
2003 to 14.0 perccnt oi' GDP in 2008; current expenditures, 011 the other hand, averaged 15.6
percent o f GDP over the 2005-08 period, but expanded in 2008 to 16.5 percent o f GDP reflecting
the increasing costs ofuntargeted subsidies. The overall deficit in 2007 was cut to 1.9 percent o f
GDP and the total debt to 38.7 percent o f GDP compared to 3.7 percent o f GDP and 40.4 percent
of GDP, respectively i n 2003.

As a result o f the global financial turmoil, record and volatile oil prices, and the global recession
that was originatccl in the advanced economies, E! Salvador's economic performance and the
overall fiscal position weakened since 2008. For instance, economic growth slowed down from
4.7 percent in 2007 to 2.5 percent while the fiscal deficit rose from 1.9 percent o f GDP in 2007
to 3.1 percent o f ODD i n 2008, and total debt rose to 39.9 percent o f GDP vis-a-vis 38.7 percent
of GDP in 2007.

In 2009, the wortd economic slowdown continues affecting adversely El Salvador's economy.
This is reflected in a 10.3 percent decline i n family remittances, a 17.0 percent drop in exports,
and a 28.3 pcrcent decline in imports, a sluggish behavior o f domestic credit, a drop in tourism
revenues. Furtherinore, the Index o f Economic Activity Volume (IVAE) -a proxy for GDP
growth, for the month o f Juiic shows, the economy contracted by 4.8 percent; in addition, more
than 30,000 jobs haw been lost due to the contraction in exports and domestic demand cutting
formal employment by 3.6 percent over the last 12 months ending in April 2009,

On the fiscal front, the deficit for the Non Financial Public Sector has widened and debt i s
increasing. Tlic rcsults for the first seven months o f 2009 indicate that the fiscal deficit reached
2.7 percent ol' G1)P compared to 1.1 percent o f GDP in the same period o f last year, reflecting a
9.0 percent dccliiic in tax collections (on a gross basis). 'Tax collections could fall short o f the
budget b y nearli $500 million equivalent to 2.3 percent o f GDP thus widening the fiscal deficit
and increasing thc total debt,

n
I the social area, despite the fact that the budgets for the Ministry o f Education and the Ministry
o f Health have incrcasecl by 52 percent and 69 percent, respectively over the 2004-09 period,
there i s still a greiit nccd to increase allocations to both institutions to deal with social lags. Even
though both poverty and extreme poverty had been reduced fiom 38.8 percent and 16.1 percent




                                                 38
 i n 2001 to 30.7 and 9.6 percent in 2006, respectively, according to the 2007 and 2008 Multiple
 Purpose Houscholtl Surveys, by 2007 both indicators havc reversed their gains. Extreme poverty
jumped to 10.8 pcrccnt and total poverty to 34.6 percent with fiirther deterioration in 2008 when
 extreme poverly reached 12.4 percent and total poverty rose to 40.0 percent.

Considering the weakened fiscal position as evidenced by a growing fiscal deficit and total
public debt and the increased social challenges poised by the current economic crisis, El
Salvador's goveriunent i s taking rapid and effective fiscal measures to bring the deficit down and
maintain debt as perccntage o f GDP on a sustainable path. To create additional fiscal space and
increase allocations to social programs, the Administration i s focusing in controlling
expenditures and incrcasing internal revenues by implementing tax and administrative reforms,
enhancing public expenditure management, and increasing transparency and accountability.

On the expenditure side, the first nieasure that the new Government approved i s the Public
Sector Austerity Policy. I t a i m at controlling current expenditures, especially those related to
goods and services, yielding a savings o f 0.2 percent o f GDP during the second semester o f
2009; in addition, the new Administration has reduced the subsidy on public sector transpoitation
by 37.5 percent.

On the reveiioe side. tlic Government was able to attain Congress`s approval to make permanent
the $0.1 surcliarge on the consumption o f gasoline and diesel. This measure helps to fully
finance the tmnsporta~ion   subsidy that prior to the reform prcssured the Treasury to make up for
the gap betwecn revenues and the transfer to the public sector transportation operators.

As a rcsult of the coinbination o f measures on both the revenue and the expenditure side, the
deficit for the tion finruicial public sector will be reduccd in 2009 from an estimated 6.0 percent
o f GDP to 5. I percent of GDP. To continue consolidating fiscal accounts and to accommodate
the new socinl needs, the Gosernment has designed a tax reform packaged which include
revisions of tas rates on cxcisc taxes, broadening the tax base o f V A T and Income Tax combined
with measures to close Ioopholes and to tackle tax evasion and smuggling. It i s estimated that
the reform package will be submitted for Congress' approval during this month.


   2. Tiic Govc~ntiient'sProgram

The current Administration`s mission is to establish peace with democracy, promoting economic
growth and social development and the vision i s to become a robust growing and educated
country, socially inclusive, with gender equality, improving justice and security.

To achievc those goals. thc Government's Strategic Objectives, include: regaining economic
growth for which the Global Anti-Crisis Program i s the first policy under implementation;
generating 1 1 w and bettcr employment by promoting productive investment, improving starting
business procedures, and increasing credit to the private sector; reducing poverty and increasing
social inclusion by ts(ablis1iing an Universal Social Protection System. In addition, the
goveimment is interested to increase transparency and accountability for which it intends to get
Legislative approval to reform the Public Sector Procurement Law and approval for an Access to




                                               39
Public Infortnation Law. Finally, it aims at consolidating democracy through an open dialogue to
establish Public Policies and strengthen governance.

Government's priorities are to protect the most vulnerable and regain economic growth in a
fiscally responsible approach. To advance in these areas, the Administration will give priority to
policies and actions to increase investment i n the agriculture and the construction sectors; in
addition, i t will continue with the process to integrate El Salvador to the global economy,
strengthening the Central American Integration Process. In the financial sector, the priority will
be to strengthen integrated financial supervision and enhance public sector banks' activities in
order to iiicrcasc credit to small and medium enterprises. In the fiscal sector, through the
Ministry 01' Finance. the Government will focus on increasing the tax intake and will implement
tax and adniinistrati\rc reforms aimed at tackling tax evasion and smuggling and closing
loopholes. In addition, it will improve public expenditure management through the application o f
the Austerity Policy, reducing subsidies, and increasing transparency and accountability. In the
social area. the niain priority i s to establish the Universal Social Protection System to reduce
poverty, cspanding the quality and coverage o f public services including education, health,
potable water, and electricity.


    3. The Anti-Crisis Progrnm

As part o f the Economic and Social Development National Strategy, on June 19, 2009, the
Government announced the implementation of an Anti-Crisis Program (ACP) to offset the
negative impacts that the global ecotiomic slowdown is having on El Salvador's economy and
sustain social gains achieved over the last years.

The main characteristics o f the ACP are: its total Dollar amount, the timeliness o f the
implenientstion constitiiliiig it as a countercyclical policy measure; the temporality as it serves
two main ob,jectives -regain economic growth and sustain social gains without compromising
medium and long term fiscal sustainability, and its holistic approach as it includes education,
health, basic pension coverage for the elderly in poor municipalities, investment in housing,
agriculturc, incrcase production o f basic grains, among others.

The four main objectives o f the ACP includc: i) protect existing and create new jobs; ii)   protect
the most vuli~erable  population from the negative impacts of the crisis, especially the poorest and
most excluded families; iii)design and iniplement the Universal Social Protection System; and
iv) iniprovc the current institutional framework taking advantage o f the new opportunities
created by the crisis to develop and implement socially inclusive public policies.


   4. The Program Supported by the DPL

Even though not directly financed with, the programs that will be supported by the DPL
operation include programs and projects that are included in the Anti-Crisis Program suck as the
expansion o f the school fceding program. It i s built around three main components: a) protecting
social expenditure and improving targeting o f subsidies; b) protecting income and consumption
o f vulnerable population; and c) strengthening institutional capacity for policy formulation and
implementation in the social sector.




                                               40
       A, Protecting social espcnditurcs and improve targeting o f subsidies

 i.    liationalization o f public transportation subsidy, In December 2007, the previous
       Administration introduced a $400 and $200 subsidy for buses and microbuses, respectively
       to maintain stable the cost o f public transportation 011 the face o f increasing costs to the
       system's operators as a result o f increasing oil prices, As the prices for fuels reached record
       levcls in 2008, the subsidy was doubled to $800 and $400, for buses and microbuses,
       respectively. Considering that this subsidy i s not well targeted and the need to protect social
       spending, the new Administration has already taken actions to reduce its cost and cut it by
       nearly 40 percent. In the medium term, the government's strategy will focus on the
       modernization ofthis sector as a means to further reduce the cost o f such subsidy.

ii.    Protecting critical non-personnel recurrent expenditures in the social sectors and
       critical investmeiits ill the healtli sector. The current Administration i s concerned that the
       negative iinpict from the crisis on the incomes o f the poors, might discourage them from
       accessing v i h l scrviccs such as cducation and health. To address this issue and to improve
       the quality mid coverage o f such services, the government is committed to maintain the
       allocations IO non-pcrsonncl recurrent expenditures, including those transfers for educational
       supplies and ineclicines, among others.


       D. Pratucting inconic and consuinption o f the vulnerable population

iii.   Expanding the School Feeding Program to urban pre-schools mid primary schools. I t
       has been tlemonstrated that the school feeding program is a successful mechanism to increase
       both attentlance and students' ability to concentrate in class. As o f June 2009, the MINED`S
       school feeding program i s servicing nearly 600,000 students betwcen pre-school and end o f
       primary educalion. Similar to [lie protection o f non-personnel expenditure action, this
       approach riims at lessening the negative impact o f the crisis on the income o f poor families
       helping thcir children to remain in school atid avoiding an increase in the drop out rate.

iv.    Ensure ~ C C C S S t o health services for the poors. Despite increasing allocations to the
       blinistry o f Heoltll over the last 10 years and the improvements in coverage and quality o f
       healtli scrvices, s t i l l an important sector o f the population did not benefit from them or had to
       makc "voluiitmy payments" to rcceive attention. To ensure free access to all sectors o f the
       population, especially to tlie poorest and most vdnerable, starting this semester the
       governincnt has climinated any voluntary payments and has declared illegal any socio
       economic evaluation to assess paynient capacity.

v.     Protect inconies of the poors. As already mentioned, the global economic recession has so
       far led to the loss o f over 30,000 jobs and a 10 percent reduction in family remittances, thus
       hurting tlie incoiiic and the consumption capacity o f thousands o f poor families, women who
       worked at maquilas are among the most severely impacted. The government is working to
       develop r? Temporary Income Support Program to neet the demands o f the poorest and most
       vulnerable sectors of the popdation.




                                                     41
       C. Strengtliening institutional capacity f o r policy fortnulation and implementation in
          the socii11 sectors for economic recovcry

 i.    Constructing polieies for thc long-term economic and social development. To this end,
       the goveri~iiicnthas created an Economic and Social Council in order to evaluate and
       establish national public: policies and build a broad based national strategy to promote social
       inclusion and higher economic growth. Fatherinore, it i s strengthening the administration at
       the Ministry o f Health and the Ministry o f Education by creating new offices aimed at
       improving services and deal with structural lags such as deficiencies in science and
       technology i n education and coverage in health.

 i
i . Raising qunlity o f school education, particularly in science and technology, and work
       sltills f o r young peoplc. As indicated in the previous point, the government i s undertaken
       institutional nieasures to improve the quality o f education, To achieve this goal, the MINED
       is developing a n d education strategy that w i l l integrate science and technology in the
       curriculum and will enhance technical skills to allow young people integration in the labor
       market on a coiiipetitiva basis. Furthermore, the MINE33 will decentralize activities at the
       Departnicntal lcvrl in order to expeditc quality improvements in classrooins reducing
       bureaucratic procedurcs :it the Central level.

iii.   Extciitlirig coucwge under t h e clecentralized models o f basic health care service
       delivery. So far, the decentralization of services has proven to be successful in providing
       adequate health care in i*ciiiotcand deprcssed areas o f the country. To consolidate this model,
       Ihc Ministr) of I icalth will create a Community Health linit which will be in charge o f the
       oversight o f the "Estcasioii of Service Coverage Program" currently managed by the
       Planning IJnit.

iv.    Creation o f tlic Univrrsal Sgstcin o f Social Protection (SPSU), to protect vulnerable
       groups and to enable thc population to participate in economic recovery. The achieve
       this goal, thc Governmcnt is restructuring the administration to include the newly created
       Social Inclusion Secretariat and the Strategic Affairs Secretariat and has streamlined the
       Technical Sccretariat's role on social policy coordination.


       5. Rcquest t o Support tlic Program

  This Policy 1,etter suinmariLes the niultiple challenges that El Salvador i s facing and the main
  policies and cspected outcomes that the new Administration envisages for the short and medium
  term. As esplained in sections 2, 3 and 4, the Government's Social Agenda i s being threatened
  by the negativc impacts from the slowdown of the global economy. Thousands o f jobs have
  already been lost. the economic activity is declining, expoits and imports are dropping and there
  are expectations that this [ w i d will continuc in the near future with the economy contracting by
  2.5 perccnt during 2009. povcrty lcvcls are widening, worsening the conditions o f living for the
  most vulnerable ones.




                                                  42
Considering all the negative economic and social inipacts that the global recession is imposing
on 131 Salvador, the technical and financial support from the World Banks is critical to help
alleviate the most urgent needs of the poorest anti most vulnerable sectors of the population and
to contribute to advance with the Social Agenda of President Mauricio Funes' government.

                           El Salvador-Assessment Letter for the World Bank
                                            October 7,2009

The latest assessment o f El Salvador by the IMF's Executive Board i s contained in the press release of
                                                                     1O.htm),
January 16,2009 (htt~://~~~.imf.0rg/external/np/~ec/pr/2009/pr09 which summarizes the views
Directors expressed at the approval o f the request for a 14-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) from the
Fund for 300 percent o f quota (about US$800million), which was to be treated as precautionary. The last
Article I V Consultation discussion took place on November 12,2008 (see
                                                    151
http://www.imf.ordexternal/n~/sec/~r1/2008/~nO8 .htm).

El Salvador has been severely impacted by the global crisis. The (former and current) authorities'
strong commitment to macroeconomic stability, supported by the Fund's Stand-By Arrangement,
contributed to maintaining investor confidence during the political transition, despite the severity of the
global financial shock. Nonetheless, the Salvadoran economy has been adversely impacted b y the
slowdown in world economic growth, in particular through trade and remittance flow linkages with the
U.S. economy. As a result, the Salvadoran economy i s now projected to contract b y 2.5 percent in 2009
(versus 2.5 percent growth under the January program framework), while end-year 12-month inflation i s
expected to fall to around 1 percent.

The decline in trade and activity has led to a sharp decline in tax revenues, while overall spending
has remained broadly in line with the budget (including the anti-crisis plan adopted b y the government
that took office o n June 1). As a result, the deficit o f the nonfinancial public sector for 2009 i s projected
to be well above original program levels at 5.1 percent o f GDP, and be financed mostly with external
resources (including from multilateral development banks). This deviation from program targets, in the
midst o f a political transition, prevented completion o f the reviews contemplated in the January
arrangement.

The collapse in imports and trade i s projected to lower the external current account deficit to under
2 percent of GDP (from 7.2 percent in 2008). The real exchange rate appears to remain broadly in line
with fundamentals, and several indicators suggest exports remain competitive. The banking system
(mainly foreign-owned) has been resilient to the global financial turmoil and remains highly liquid,
although nonperforming loans are increasing, and rising provisioning i s cutting into profitability.

In late September, Fund staff and the authorities reached agreement, ad referendum, on a three-
year macroeconomic program that could be supported by a new Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The
authorities program i s anchored on maintaining the dollarization regime, improving public expenditure
management, and ensuring fiscal sustainability and financial sector stability. The strategy envisages that
output growth w i l l remain subdued in 2010 and that the recovery w i l l start taking hold in 201 1; inflation
i s expected to remain stable at 2%-3 percent. The fiscal program envisages a steady but gradual
improvement in the overall fiscal deficit, starting with a reduction in the deficit to 4.3 percent o f GDP
in 2010 and further into the medium term consistent with an overall declining debt path. The program
gives priority to improving the efficiency o f social protection programs, infrastructure investment and tax
administration. The economic program envisages a moderate increase in the external current account
deficit, financed mainly b y FDI flows and official borrowing (mainly from multilaterals). The program
w i l l continue to strengthen the financial system: the authorities have submitted legislation to bolster
financial sector supervision (expected to be approved before year end) and plan to review the bank
resolution framework, and strengthen the legal basis for investment funds. Fund s t a f f regards the

                        ANNEX 4: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

 1.    The outlook on El Salvador's medium-term macroeconomic prospects has deteriorated since the
last DSA was prepared in the context o f the Public Finance and Social Sector Development Policy Loan.
As a result debt dynamics have also changed. The revised debt sustainability analysis in this Program
Document i s based on the macroeconomic framework developed b y IMF staff for the Standby Program
and Bank staff projections.

2.       The debt sustainability analysis (Table A.l) indicates that the public debt to GDP ratio i s
expected to continue on an increasing path until 2011, when i t w i l l reach 50.1 percent o f GDP before
starting to decline to reach 46.2 percent in 2014. This trajectory would be consistent with a primary fiscal
balance deficit averaging 1.5 percent o f GDP over 2009-2011, and a primary balance surplus averaging .7
percent o f GDP over 2012-2014. The fiscal improvement after 2011 would be driven b y both an expected
better economic environment and the fiscal interventions o f the Government (tax reform and
rationalization o f subsidies). As for the trajectory o f the total external debt, the revised macroeconomic
framework assumes an average non interest current account balance surplus o f 0.4 percent o f GDP over
2009-2014 and i s consistent with stable debt dynamics until 2011 (at about 44 percent o f GDP) before
declining to 40.5 percent o f GDP in 2014.

 Key Assumptions

 Real GDP growth (%)                                     -2.5    0.5    2.0        3.0    4.0    4.0
 Inflation (%, e-o-p)                                     1.o    2.5    2.8        2.8    2.8    2.8

 Growth o f real primary spending (% o f GDP)              1.7    0.5        2.0    3.0    4.0    4.0
 Primary balance (% o f GDP)                              -2.9   -1.3       -0.3    0.3    0.9    1.0

 Nominal interest rate on public debt (%)                 5.9     6.5       6.4     6.4    6.3    6.3

 Growth of exports (US dollar, %)                     -15.0       2.8       6.5     7.0    7.4    8.1
 Growth o f imports (US dollar, %)                    -23.0       6.6       6.0     6.8    8.5    8.5

 Non-interest current account balance (% of GDP)          1.2    -0.2       0.2     0.4    0.1    0.0


3.      Thus, even though the higher public debt levels in the revised D S A imply an increase in the
country's vulnerabilities, in the absence o f a crisis scenario the medium-tern public and external
positions of El Salvador remain sustainable.


                                                    50
4.       There are, however, a number o f risks to the medium-term outlook associated with the global
situation, as well as with the ability o f the new administration to maintain macro stability and push
structural reforms in a very volatile environment. Table A2 presents projected debt dynamics under more
pessimistic alternative scenarios:

     o   Under less optimistic growth scenarios with growth .5 percentage points over 2009-2014 lower
         than the one in the baseline (3.5 percent over 2008-2013) -scenarios A1 and B l - the total external
         debt to GDP ratio would be about 1 percentage point o f GDP higher than under the baseline
         scenario, whereas the public debt would be 2.5 percentage points o f GDP higher than under the
         baseline scenario.

     o   Under tighter financial market conditions resulting in higher interest rates both for the external
         and the public debt o f around .5 percentage points over 2008-2013 -scenarios A2 and B2-,
         projected debt indicators for 2014 would be .5 higher than under the baseline scenarios for the
         external debt and 1.4 percent higher for the public debt.

     o   Under a more difficult external environment -scenario A3- resulting in a higher current account
         deficit (.8 percentage points o f GDP), the total external debt to GDP ratio would reach about 44.7
         percent in 2014.

     o   Under a looser fiscal policy -scenario B3- with an average primary balance deficit o f .7 percent o f
         GDP over 2009-2014 rather than the assumed 0.4 percent o f GDP under the baseline scenario, the
         public debt to GDP ratio would be in 2014 about 2 percentage points o f GDP higher than under
         the baseline scenario.

     o   Scenarios projecting the impact o f contemporaneous shocks (albeit more moderate than those in
         Al-A3 and Bl-B3) -scenarios A4 and B4- would result in indicators for 2014 o f 43.3 percent o f
         GDP and 48.7 percent o f GDP for the external and public debt, respectively.

     o   Scenarios based o n key variables fixed at 10 year historical levels -scenarios A5 and B5- would
         result in an external debt to GDP ratio 2014 projection that i s about 2.3 percentage points lower
         than under the baseline and in a 2014 public debt to GDP ratio that i s 1 percentage point higher
         than under the baseline.
