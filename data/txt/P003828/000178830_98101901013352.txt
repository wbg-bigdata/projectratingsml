I.  THE SECTOR
A. Background
1.01      Population.  Indonesia is the fifth most populous country in the
world with more than 150 million people 'Living on 3,000 islands. The
average population density is 77 per sq km, but in East Java (the Province
in which the proposed Project is located') it is 609, one of the highest in
the world. With 30 million people, the province has 20% of Indonesia's
population and 2% of its land area. Indonesia's population is increasing at
an average annual rate of 2.3% and in Java the rate is 1.5%. About 20% of
the national population lives in urban areas which are growing at 3.7% per
annum. Eleven percent of East Java's population reside in its eight self-
governing cities (Kotamadya). The largest of these, Surabaya, has 2.2
million people and is, after Jakarta, Indonesia's second largest city.
Tables 1 and 2 of Annex 1 provide additional data on population, population
density and land area for Indonesia, Java and East Java Province.
1.02      Administration.  Indonesia has 27 provinces which are divided into
216 districts (Kabupatens), and these in turn are divided into about 3,300
subdistricts (Kecamatens).  There are 54 autonomous cities (Kotamadyas),
about 3,300 district towns (Ibu Kota Kecamatens), and about 65,000 villages
(Desas). East Java Province has 29 Kabupatens, 54 Kecamatens, 8 Kotamadyas
and 8,260 Desas.
1.03      Health.  As measured by standard indices, health conditions in
Indonesia lag behind those in other countries at a similar stage of economic
development. At the end of the 1970s, life expectancy in Indonesia was 53
years, while the average for other low- and middle-income countries was 57
and 61 years, respectively. The average infant mortality rate was estimated
at 93 per 1,000 births compared to about 55 in the Philippines and Thailand,
and 32 in Malaysia. Infant mortality rates as high as 200 per 1,000 births
have been reported in some areas. Endemic diseases, caused principally by
poor water supply and sanitation, are major factors behind these statistics.
In 1974, the latest year for which comprehensive statistics are available,
Indonesia exceeded all other countries in the number of cases and deaths
from cholera. Additional comparative health indicators, together with other
basic indicators, are given in Annex 1, Table 3.
1.04      Water Resources.  Indonesia is well endowed with rainfall and
ground and surface water resources, but problems of distance, reliability,
contamination, excessive demand and conflicting uses preclude simple and
rapid development on a wide scale. Because of population density, intensive
agriculture and above average industrialization and urbanization, the water
supply situation in Java is more critical than in other parts of Indonesia.
Although Java has above average rainfall, (a) it has only 6% of the nation's
available water; (b) its per capita water availability is only 9% of the



national average and (c) the estimated 1990 demand represents 98% of the
available supply in Java and 46% of the nations total demand.  For further
details, see Annex 1, Table 4.
1.05       Indonesia water resource specialists estimate that household and
industrial water requirements are about 5% and agricultural needs about 95%
of total needs. Much of household needs can be supplied from subsurface
water and springs, but usually the location and reliability of such sources
are not precisely known and their development requires exploration time and
expense. Surface water, while more readily accessible, has the disadvantage
of requiring more specialized treatment which is both cosl:ly to build and to
operate. On balance, from technical and economic standpoints, subsurface
and spring sources are preferable and all of the schemes under this Project
use these sources.
B. Sector Service Levels
1.06       About 40% of the urban population had access to piped water supply
in 1981. Much of this suffers from contamination, low pressure, and
intermittent supply. A considerable portion of the urban population does
not have access to public water supply and is dependent on water from
vendors or from shallow wells, streams or rivers at considerable health
risks.  Only 20% of the urban population has satisfactory sanitation
facilities.
1.07       Of the rural population, only 18% had access to potable water from
either piped systems, wells with handpumps, central rainwater collectors or
protected springs. The remaining 82% obtain water from unprotected streams,
springs or wells. Only 24% of the rural population is estimated to have
satisfactory sanitation facilities.
1.08       While the present situation is unsatisfactory, there has been
considerable improvement in water supply over the period 1970-81 during
which the percentage of population served rose from 2.5% to 23%. However,
the absolute number of people without access to safe water remained almost
the same at 118 million in 1970 as against 117 million in 1981. The
proportion of the population served by sanitary facilities in the country
has increased from about 15% in 1970 to 23% in 1981, but the population not
served also increased, i.e., from 103 million to 117 million, with the urban
areas particularly falling behind. The water supply and sanitation
situation in 1970 and 1981, in both the urban and rural areas, is shown in
Table 1.1.

C. Sector Institutions
1.09      Three ministries of the Government of Indonesia (GOI) are
principally responsible for the water supply, sewerage and sanitation sector.
The Ministry of Public Works is responsible for development in urban areas,
the Ministry of Health for rural areas, and the Ministry of Home Affairs,
indirectly, for overseeing operations (see para. 1.24). Other government
agencies with a role in the sector include the National Development Planning
Board (BAPPENAS) which allocates funds for development projects, and the
Ministry of Finance which disburses funds to the executing agencies and
establishes the terms under which such funds are provided.
1.10      Within the Ministry of Public Works, the Directorate of Sanitary
Engineering (DSE) of the Directorate General Cipta Karya (CK) is responsible
for overall planning, design and implementation of water supply, sewerage
and sanitation projects funded by GOI (see para. 2.02). During the period
of construction DSE and CK provide technical and managerial assistance to
water supply and sewerage utilities and on occasion temporarily operate water
utilities until they become semi-autonomous water enterprises (PDAMs). At
present they operate about 80 such utilities.
1.11      The Ministry of Health, through its Directorate of Hygiene and
Sanitation (DHS) is responsible for rural water supply and sanitation. DHS
supervises design and construction, and assists in operation and maintenance.
CK provides technical advice to DHS and the public works departments of
individual provinces and kabupatens undertake construction.



- 4 -
1.12       Water and sanitation systems are owned and operated by local
governments, either by a department (a Dinas), or by a semi-autonomous public
enterprise (a PDAM). Occasionally these entities also engage in the
construction of projects. The Ministry of Home Affairs, by virtue of its
responsibility for local government and local government enterprises, oversees
such operations.
D. Sector Development
1.13       During the period covered by GOI's First Five-Year Development Plan
(REPELITA I, covering 1969-74), total capital investment in the sector was
close to Rp 16 billion. About 80% of this amount was contributed by GOI, and
included the funds provided by external assistance agencies; the balance was
obtained from various local sources including provincial budgets. The initial
emphasis was on water supply; production capacity increased from 9,000 liters
per second (lps) to 15,000 lps during the period. Investment during REPELITA
II (1974-79) amounted to Rp 166 billion, of which Rp 140 billion was invested
in urban projects and Rp 26 billion in rural projects. Productive capacity
increased from 15,000 lps to 21,000 lps during this period.
1.14       In 1979 as REPELITA II Twas drawing to a close, it was recognized
that the pace of development needed to be accelerated, and that in particular
the smaller cities and towns and the poor of those places must be accorded
priority. Therefore, during REPELITA III (1979-1984) the Government embarked
upon a "basic needs" approach to projects which seeks to rapidly provide
essential service at low-cost for the cities and towns included in the current
and successive Plans. Under the impetus of the UN International Drinking
Water and Sanitation Decade overall service level targets were set by GOI in
1981 for 1990 as follows: urban and rural water supply to serve 75% and 60%
of the total population, respectively; and urban and rural sanitation to serve
60% and 40% of the total population, respectively. Two major programs for
meeting the targets for urban water supply in the 1980s are the Basic Needs
Approach (BNA) program for cities and larger towns (with populations 20,000
and up), and the Ibu Kota Kecamaten (IKK) program for kecamaten headquarter
towns with populations in the 3,000-20,000 range (para. 1.17).
E. Earlier Bank Lending
1.15       The Bank has made two urban water supply loans which cover a total
of 12 cities. The first, (Loan 1049 of 1974) sought to apply the principal
recommendations of a 1971 sector report that (a) financing for projects be by
loan rather than grant; (b) semi-autonomous water utilities (PDAMs) be estab-
lished and developed; (c) DSE be reorganized and its management capabilities
improved; (d) the functions of the key ministries active in the sector be
defined; and (e) staff be trained to implement projects and operate systems.
That project is now virtually complete but experienced a 2-1/2 year delay
caused by poor performance of the consultant responsible for design, slow and
cumbersome procurement procedures, and delayed deliveries by several
suppliers. PDAMs for the beneficiary cities have been developed and are
generally performing satisfactorily. DSE, which underwent reorganization and



- 5 -
staff strengthening, improved its capabilities but is still overburdened
because its workload expanded so greatly (see para. 2.02). Important
departures from covenants under the loan agreement concern: (i) the
Government's failure to submit adequate audited financial statements for the
beneficiary PDAMs (Section 4.02(b) of Loan Agreement 1049); and (ii) the
failure of Government agencies to pay their water bills (Section 4.05(b) of
Loan Agreement 1049). A problem on this first project is in its delivery of
benefits: the installation of service connections for three of the five PDAMs
has been delayed and the expected benefits from them will accrue more
gradually - from one to three years later - than originally planned. The
delay resulted from project implementor's late recognition that connections
were a part of the main project framework and not, as had been past practice,
a part of the PDAM-s routine connection program. The Project Completion
Report currently under preparation will review these and other issues.
1.16      The second Bank project (Loan 1709 of 1979) followed the lines of
the first project. It continued the strengthening of DSE, the establishment
and development of seven PDAMs, and the training of staff. It experienced
delays in preparation and procurement of about one year but now all supply
contracts have been placed and it is moving at a normal rate. Audited
financial statements and payment of bills by Government agencies are also a
problems under this project, as they are country-wide. Audits are the subject
of ongoing dialogue with Government. In addition to the establishment in 1931
of an Accounting Development Board to advise the Government on development of
accounting and audit, present discussions are focusing on the establishment of
a Governmental Commission with powers to execute major improvements of
accounting and auditing in Indonesia. For PDAMs receiving support under Bank
projects, the Directorate General of State Financial Control of the Ministry
of Finance is designated as independent auditor. During negotiations CK
confirmed that it will employ independent GOI-authorized accountants from the
private sector to assist the PDAMs in p:reparing their accounts for audit.
Regarding nonpayment of water bills by GOI agencies, CK agreed to (i) study
the underlying the causes for non-payment; (ii) provide assistance and
training to PDAMs in the areas of billing and collecting; and (iii) mount a
campaign to increase public awareness of the cost of (and hence the need to
conserve and pay for) potable water.
F. Urban Water Supply - Policies, Issues and Constraints
1.17      Government Objectives and Mechanisms.  The Government-s urban water
supply objective as enunciated at its 1982 National Workshop /1 is to provide
by 1990 water supply systems to 75% of the urban population. It would do this
by continuing BNA and IKK Programs (para. 1.14) started in Repelita III, that
is, to build systems with grant financing which provide an average of 60 lpcd
(45 lpcd for IKK) to about 60% of the population. Systems with capacities
from 60 to 120 lpcd would be financed by a blend of loans and equity, and
above 120 lpcd by loans only. Government-s program includes training of water
/1 Hleld in Bali in October 1982 and attended by representatives of BAPPENAS
and the Ministries of Finance, Health, Home Affairs and Public Works.



-6-
supply staff, public health education, and improving the capabilities of local
consultants, civil works contractors and suppliers.
1.18      BNA and IKK projects are distinguished from earlier ones in that
special attention is given to speedy implementation, low cost construction,
and designs which focus on household needs including the poor. The intent
is to build systems which provide an essential service at an affordable
price, to use scarce manpower effectively , and to demonstrate to consumers
the benefits of safe water so the community itself will take initiatives to
extend and improve the service. Accordingly facilities are of low cost
design; design procedures are standardized; half of the population served
receives house or yard connections, the other half standpipe service;
projects are executed in the provinces and kabuputens by local staff to the
extent capabilities there permit; goods are purchased in bulk and
distributed from regional and central stores; the projects are financed as
grants and are given free to the communities; and tariffs are expected to
cover operation and maintenance costs and the depreciation, (although some
subprojects may be subsidized in the early years of operations when there are
few connections).
1.19      Government-s basic needs programs have praiseworthy objectives and
the mechanisms for implementating them are logical. The Bank-s strategy for
the sector is to support the Government's program, to help identify areas
where improvements are desirable, and, over time, to assist in bringing
about such improvements. The ADB and the Australian and Netherlands
Governments are equally committed to support the sector and there have been
good coordination and useful information exchanges between these and other
external agencies and the Bank. The proposed Project follows current
practices but encourages and supports reassessments which in the longer term
should further strengthen the sector./l These reassessments would be in the
areas discussed below.
1.20      Investment Funds and Cost Recovery.  The investment required to
meet the 1990 urban water supply target is estimated to be about US$1.7
billion, or US$240 million per year for the remaining years of the decade.
This represents a three fold increase over the 1981 sector investment budget
and an allocation to urban water supply of more than one percent of the
total development budget. Given Governments stringent resource position,
it is considering options to recover from water users a portion of the
capital costs, which would contribute to a revolving fund to be used to
offset the capital cost of subsequent projects. Analysis by Bank staff of
subprojects in East Java province indicate that such cost recovery could
finance a portion -- perhaps up to 30% -- of the capital cost with tariffs
at levels which can be afforded by East Javan communities. Under the
/1 In addition to the dialogue which took place during the preparation of
this Project the Bank has under way an Urban Sector Study which is
analyzing institutional and financial arrangements for urban develop-
ment generally. The results of its work will complemernt that being
done in connection with water supply projects.



-7-
proposed loan, consultants will study the merits, effects and institutional
arrangements for capital recovery, and the findings of the study would help
shape policy in this area (para. 6.06).
1.21      Project Implementation.  By law the provision of water supply is
the responsibility of local government, but in reality the central govern-
ment plays the leading role in design, construction and funding of projects.
At the first National Workshop for Water Supply and Sanitation (Bali, 1981)
the participating ministries agreed to promote regional autonomy in develop-
ing projects. This is desirable given the size and geographical dispersion
of Indonesia, and because it builds up Local capabilities, shortens the
management span and helps ensure that projects are responsive to local
needs. Consistent with the Workshop's recommendations, recently more design,
planning and construction supervision work is being done in the regions.
But it is usually done by a province-based office of the central Directorate
of Sanitary Engineering rather than by offices of the provincial government;
hence not all of the advantages of decentralization are achieved. Under
this Project, as described in para. 4.01, there will be more local
responsibility than heretofore and the arrangements will serve as a test for
future projects in East Java and other provinces.
1.22      Operation and Maintenance.  Water systems, although generally
built by DSE, are operated by the local government either as a unit of its
public works department (a Dinas) or as a local government enterprise (a
PDAM). As a Dinas, staff and accounts are not kept separate from other
government functions and water revenues flow into the local government's
general fund. As a PDAM, the enterprise is directed by a board, it employs
management and staff who work exclusively for the utility, and accounts are
independent of other agencies. The concept of PDAM's is sound and Govern-
ment intends that eventually all urban water systems will be operated by
them.
1.23      The functioning of PDAMs is not without problems.  Newly employed
staff require extensive training and experience, and accounting, management
and operational systems have to be developed. Overstaffing is common and
some local governments have used the water systems as a source of income,
(resulting in excessive connection charges and underutilized capacity).
These practices frequently continue despite the intent of financial and
managerial autonomy. Each PDAM has a Board of Directors with representation
from local and central governments, but the notion of assertively providing
a public service through a financially viable, well managed organization has
to be instilled virtually case by case. Advice and control by a higher
authority also appears to be necessary.
1.24      As part of its institution building function, on centrally funded
projects DSE sets up PDAM management anid accounting systems and trains staff
in their use (and assurances to this effect, for the PDAMs benefitting



- 8 -
from the Project, have been obtained at negotiations). But after projects are
complete DSE has few legal powers and insufficient staff to continue control.
The Directorate for Urban Development of the Ministry of Home Affairs nominal-
ly has the authority to supervise and assist the PDAMs but it has neither
staff nor qualifications to do so. In any case the numbers and diversity of
PDAMs are so great that in the long run, central controls over individual
PDAMs probably would not be workable. In provinces which have numerous
PDAMs (such as East Java) a provincially based control unit would appear to
be appropriate, possibly located as a part of an existing office of the
Provincial Government, and, through a line of command, responsible to the
Governor. Under the proposed Project DSE will provide assistance during the
construction period and the Bureau for Promotion of Economic Infra-
structure /1 of the East Java Provincial Government would gradually assume
responsibilities as the facilities come into operation. The Bureau among
other things, would: (i) provide technical and financial guidance to the
PDAMs; (ii) supervise the operation, finance and management of PDAMs; (iii)
review and assist in the preparation of tariff and other charges; (iv) study
investment proposals and review their priority and justification; (v)
provide channels to exchange information on the improvement of systems and
procedures. These are new functions for the Bureau; the functions would be
prescribed in detail, and Bureau staff trained, by consultants employed
under the Project.
1.25      Human Resources for the Urban Water Program.  The Directorate of
Sanitary Engineering has in progress a manpower development program which
was started in 1979 under Dutch assistance. The program is one (among many)
of the Ministry of Public Works training activities. It has the objective
of training management, administrative and operating personnel for DSE and
water enterprises. The program has experienced difficulties, some due to
design, some to implementation, and at present is not operal-ing at a
satisfactory level. Cipta Karya, with the participation of consultants and
a Bank training specialist, is re-evaluating and reforming it, and
attempting to move more of the training activities to the provinces. Under
the proposed Project, funds are allocated to support, in parallel with Dutch
funds, a revitalization of both regional and national train:ing activities;
(details are in Annex 2.) This would complement a broader effort to
strengthen MPW staff training activities to be supported by the proposed
Manpower Development Project, and DSE would utilize as appropriate the
facilities and services provided under that project. The form and function
of the training program to be supported by the proposed loan were confirmed
at technical discussions which preceeded negotiations. Details are in
Annex 2.

II. THE BORROWER AND) BENEFICIARIES
A. The Borrower
2.01      The Government of Indonesia normally acts as the borrower of loans
provided by multilateral and bilateral agencies. It then passes the
proceeds, together with the local currency requirements, to the executing
agencies. For the proposed project, GOI would be the borrower and the
proceeds would be allocated to Cipta Kary'a - the proposed executing agency
which, in cooperation with the East Java Provincial Government and eight
kabupatens, would implement the Project. On completion of the Project the
assets would be turned over to the eight PDAMs as equity and management and
operations would be entrusted to them.
B. Cipta Karya and DSE
2.02      Cipta Karya, with a staff of about 5,000, is composed of five
Directorates, i.e., Building Development, Building Research, Housing, City
and Regional Planning, and Sanitary Engineering. The Directorate of
Sanitary Engineering (DSE), with a staff of about 1,600, is composed of the
subdirectorates of Planning, Construction, Development and Logistics and an
Administration Division. DSE's Planning Center (under the Planning
Subdirectorate) is the focal point for the planning and implementation of
BNA and IKK projects. Its 350 engineers and technicians, with the assist-
ance of consultants, prepare projects, train regional staff in project
design, review designs, and monitor projects and programs. DSE also has
regional project offices in 20 of the 27 provinces; these offices normally
execute projects outside Jakarta. The East Java project office is staffed
with 12 engineers and technicians and annually executes about 20 water
supply projects. For large projects and those which receive foreign
assistance DSE appoints specific project mnanagers who work under the general
supervision of the Director of DSE. The staffing of DSE is shown in Annex 1
Table 5 and the organizations of Cipta Karya and DSE are shown in Charts 1
and 2.
2.03      About 500 of DSE-s staff are employed at the headquarters in
Jakarta. Of the total central staff about 300 are directly engaged on
central planning, development and construction activities. About 30% of the
staff at the headquarters hold engineering or technical degrees and another
25% are educated in finance or administraltion. DSE's staff virtually
doubled over the last several years, in parallel with the growth in sector
programs. But despite this increase, there are still manpower constraints
in terms of numbers of people, their educational qualifications and
experience. For this reason DSE is making increasing use of its province-
based offices, and cooperates with provincial, kotamadya and kabupaten
governments in the implementation of projects.



- 10 -
2.04      Cipta Karya and DSE receive considerable technical assistance: the
Bank is financing the services of a full-time expatriate Management Advisor;
the Australian Government has provided six engineering advisors and is plan-
ning additional technical assistance projects; WHO provides a full-time
sanitary engineering advisor; UNDP is funding a sanitation specialist; WHO
and DANIDA are helping to develop a monitoring and information system; and
the Dutch Government provides engineering consultants and, until 1982, an
economist and an engineer to assist the Planning Division of Cipta Karya's
Secretariat.
C. The Provincial and Kabupaten Governments
2.05      East Java Province is managed by the Governor who, while reporting
to the Ministry of Home Affairs, is also the representative of all central
ministries active in the Province. In 1982 the Provincial Public Works
Department of East Java was split into three departments, Cipta Karya (for
urban development), Bina Marga (roads) and Pengarin (irrigation), each of
which reports to the Governor. The new Provincial Cipta Karya, which has
taken over the urban development staff of the former Provincial Public Works
Department, will share responsibility for project implementation with
Central Cipta Karya. To this end, in addition to its own staff, it would
use qualified persons from the public works departments of the eight second
level governments (i.e., seven kabupatens and one kotamadya) which are
beneficiaries of the Project. The public works capabilities of the
provinces of Java are generally recognized as among the best in Indonesia.
D. Water Enterprises - PDAMs
2.06      Project facilities would be owned and operated by PDAMs under the
direction and ownership of the kabupaten or kotamadya governments in which
they are located. Law No. 5 of 1962, Law No. 5 of 1974, and the Ministry of
Home Affairs Decree 26 of 1975 provide the legal framework for PDAMs. There
is considerable experience in establishing and operating PDAMs in Indonesia./l
The regulation for each PDAM is approved by the respective People's Council
of the kotamadya or kabupaten and it is ratified by the Governor. Whereas
typically PDAMs were organized to serve a single urban area, in order to
effectively and efficiently use management systems and manpower, PDAMs have
recently been organized to operate all urban systems within a kabupaten.
Such is the model for the PDAMs covered by the Project, a typical organiza-
tion is shown in Chart 3. Under the proposed Project, five PDAMs are
already formed and operate limited existing systems and three others would
be formed before the systems come into operation (para. 6.01). The
Preliminary Design Studies (Document B.1 in the Project File) describe the
existing PDAMs and their proposed organization. PDAM management reports to
a board of directors and the board chairman is typically the head (Bupati)
of the kabupaten. The board appoints the Managing Director who, with the
/1 Twelve PDAMs are beneficiaries under two earlier Bank loans. They have
been established and strengthened by technical assistance components of
the projects, and many of the management systems developed for them are
now used nationwide.



- 11 -
assistance of three deputy managers (Finance, Technical and Operations), is
responsible for implementing policy and conducting day to day business.
Kabupaten PDAMs have a head office in the principal city and local operating
units in the other cities and towns of the kabupaten. Tariff adjustments
are approved by each PDAM and ratified by the Bupati and Governor. There
are -national guidelines for the tariff structure (para. 6.04) which are
generally followed by PDAMs.
III. THE PROJECT /1
A. General
3.01      In the late 1970s, the Government developed its Basic Needs Approach
(BNA) for water supply with the objective of providing low cost essential
service to numerous cities and towns with populations of 20,000 or more
(para. 1.14). As a part of this program, CK employed consultants to prepare
25 such projects in East Java. Subsequently Government added the IKK program
to its development efforts. The original plan was to do two projects in East
Java with Bank support, one under each program. But in 1982 these were merged
as a single project because many of the subprojects from the two programs were
in the same kabupatens and would be operated by the same PDAMs, thereby
enabling administrative and physical efficiencies. Accordingly, this Project
is comprised of subprojects in 13 cities and 37 IKK towns, one located in a
Kotamadya (Madiun) and the others in seven of East Java-s 27 kabupatens.
3.02      The beneficiary cities and towns were selected by CK in consultation
with the Ministry of Home Affairs, the East Java Provincial government and
local governments using a rating and ranking system which included: cost
(favoring towns easily supplied by groundwater or springs), need (where there
is a significant water service deficit or health problem), economic growth
potential, and parallelism with other government programs. The ranking
system was reviewed by Bank staff and is satisfactory. The original list
included 25 cities and 100 towns scattered throughout East Java Province. In
order to keep the project manageable, and so that attention could focus on the
/1  The analysis presented in this Appraisal Report is based on an exchange
rate of 700 Rupiah to the US dollar. However, after project appraisal and
loan negotiations the Government announced on March 30, 1983, the devalua-
tion of the Rupiah from 700 to 970 per dollar. While it is difficult at
this early stage to completely assess the effect of this decision we have
concluded that it will not materially change the basic scope and objec-
tives of the project. The base cost of the project as expressed in
dollars equivalent, would decline somewhat and consequently the rate of
Bank participation in the project would increase slightly. The project
cost, as expressed in Rupiah will increase both because of the 38% upward
adjustment of the Rupiah equivalent of the foreign costs and an increase
in local inflation which can be expected to follow the devaluation
decision. Consequently, tariffs about 7% higher (in 1983 prices) than
indicated in the appraisal will be needed to comply in 1988 with the
revenue covenant. This would not however affect the affordability of the
project to the beneficiaries since the resulting higher water bills would
be well within the capacity of even the poorest consumers to pay.

development of kabupaten - wide PDAMs, 50 cities and towns located in eight
kabupatens were selected for an initial project. Government intends to carry
out a subsequent project for additional cities and towns in the near future.
3.03       The subprojects in the BNA cities were prepared by Sir M. Macdonald
and Partners (acting as lead consultant) and three consortia of Indonesian
consulting companies (totaling 13 firms). The IKK subprojects were prepared
by P.T. Ciriajasa and Associates, a consortia of Indonesian firms. All
preparation work was funded by proceeds of Bank loan 1709, the Second Water
Supply Project. Several missions visited Indonesia over the period 1979-1982
in connection with the Project. There were several policy issues which were
addressed during the course of project preparation and this process took time
and effort. These included (a) tariff and cost recovery issues (para. 1.20);
(b) arrangements for project implementation (para. 1.21); and (c) institu-
tional issues such as how PDAMs would be controlled (para. 1.24).
3.04       The Project is based upon preliminary design reports prepared by the
consultants which cover engineering, institutional, operational and financial
subjects. These reports, completed in September-October 1982, are the primary
documents for this appraisal. Some concepts and assumptions were subsequently
modified, most notably in the area of demand and financial projections
(paras. 5.03 and 6.09).
B. Objectives
3.05       The objectives of the Project are to:
(a) provide potable water to about 60% of the population and
commercial and industrial users in 50 cities and towns of East
Java./l The Project is expected to serve about 720,000 persons.
About half of them are poor and most would have access to potable
water for the first time;
(b) establish PDAMs, develop or improve their organizational
capabilities and strengthen their technical and financial
performance;
(c) continue Bank assistance to DSE and Cipta Karya and strengthen
their managerial capabilities;
(d) establish a permanent training unit for East Java Province,
strengthen DSE's capability to manage nationwide training, and
assist in the more rapid decentralization of training to other
provinces; and
(e) provide a vehicle for study and dialogue to promote efficient and
appropriate policies and institutions, including financial policies,
/1 In order to simplify project preparation and implementation the Govern-
ment has asked external agencies to concentrate their efforts on
designated provinces. Thus ADB supports projects in Central Java and
South Sumatera; the Netherlands, West Java, North Surmatera and Aceh; the
Bank, East Java and, in the future, the three provinces of Sulawesi.

technical criteria and institutional arrangements, for the water
supply sector.
C. Content
3.06      The Project consists of 50 water supply subprojects, technical
assistance for project implementation and institutional development, and
training. The water works component consists of fifty piped water supply
systems. Each system will be complete with source development, pumps and
motors where necessary, transmission and distribution pipe, service reservoirs
and treatment where appropriate, service connections and public standpipes,
and office and workshop space (a description of each system is in the Project
File).  Water sources would be either spring or tubewells since these have
been determined to be lowest cost and capable of producing water of sufficient
quantity and quality./l Gravity pressure systems will be used where feasible
to avoid the need for pumping equipment and recurrent energy costs. Pipes
will be of polybutylene, polyvinylchloride or asbestos cement, reservoirs of
reinforced concrete. Service connections for BNA subprojects would be
metered, for IKK subprojects, fitted with flow restrictors (see para. 3.07).
(Flow restricted service connections enable the distribution system to be of
lower capacity and hence of lower costs. They also eliminate meters and
costly volume-based billing. Their disadvantage is that the consumer cannot
instantaneously draw a large volume of water, thereby necessitating in-house
storage.) Water from all systems would be chlorinated and meet WHO Drinking
Water Standards; most systems would meet these standards without treatment
(for those few systems where treatment is required, only aeration is neces-
sary). The estimated numbers of these facilities are given in para. 3.10.
Sanitation is not included in the Project but is being addressed under other
government programs, including those of INPRES and Kampung Improvement
Program (KIP),/2 and government will coordinate those programs with water
supply to the extent feasible.
3.07      Planning and Design Criteria.  Thirteen of the subprojects are in
cities which fall under the Government-s BNA program, and 37 in towns under
the IKK program (see paras. 1.14, 1.17 and 1.18). Although the numbers and
locations of the cities and towns are established, the option remains to
substitute a limited number of them provided their replacements meet the
selection criteria and funds are sufficient. There are eight existing systems
in the BNA cities; five will be abandoned because of age and inefficiencies,
and three will be integrated with the proposed subprojects. There are no

work primarily for the Directorate General Water Resources Development.
Consequently groundwater exploitation is coordinated with irrigation
activities such as those funded by the Bank-s Seventeenth Irrigation
Project.
/2  INPRES is a presidential funding source which is provided directly to
provincial and kabupaten projects of their choice. KIP is a program to
improve the quality of crowded urban areas; typically it covers walks,
roads, drains, water supply and sanitation. KIP is financed in part by
the Bank-s urban development loans.

existing systems in the ITKK towns. Facilities are designed in accordance with
DSE criteria, standards and procedures which have been developed with the
assistance of consultants. The design service levels and how the water is
allocated is shown in Table 3.1. Improvements in design criteria have
evolved over the past year and this would continue over the course of the
Project. Also systems presently being installed would be monitored (in
particular those with flow-restricted service connections, see para. 3.06)
with the view of improving the effectiveness of future design and ensuring
customer acceptance. At negotiations assurances were obtained that DSE,
under terms agreed with the Bank, would arrange for a review of design
criteria and monitor systems in operation. Design and physical works under
this Project are proceeding without awaiting the results of this review but
recommendations of the review would be adopted for this project where
feasible, and for future projects. Annex 4 presents details of the planning
and design criteria, lists items to be included in the above review, and would
serve as a supervision checklist for the review of final designs and draft
contracts.

(para. 3.06); (f) continue assistance to DSE and CK so they may more
effectively carry out their responsibilities under the Government's expanding
urban development and water supply programs. Consultants would assist DSE's
Development Subdirectorate in carrying out (a) and (b) above and would
assist CK in (c), (d) and (e). For (f), management consultants would be
employed to make an assessment of DSE's and CK's responsibilities,
functions, development targets, management systems, organization, staffing
and operating budget, and recommend improvement actions. Annex 3 elaborates
on the technical assistance and study components of the Project.
3.09      Engineering services under the Project consists of assistance to the
Project Management and Implementing Units i;n project management, construction
supervision and manufacturing plant inspections. These services would be
provided by local and foreign consultants. Additionally consultants would
be employed to prepare future water supply projects.
3.10      Summarized, the Project elements are:
(a) Civil Works and Equipment
(i) 1,400 km of pipe and 3,500 valves of 20 mm to 400 mm;
(ii) 50 forwarding pumps of 5 to 40 liters per second capacity;
(iii) 70 tubewells with screens, casings, pumps and motors;
(iv)  80 chlorinators;
(v) 15 reservoirs of 60 to 1,000 cu m capacity;
(vi) 86 diesel generators of 5 to 40 Kw output;
(vii) 63,000 service connections and 45,000 water meters; and
(viii) miscellaneous supporting equipment, office buildings, ware-
houses and works.
(b)  Institutional Development and Training.  The provision of
experts and consultants to develop PDAMs, establish a training
system and train trainers, develop capability for assisting and
monitoring PDAMs, review design criteria and improve the effec-
tiveness of CK, including DSE.
(c) Engineering Services. The provision of consultants for project
management and supervision, review of design criteria and the
preparation of future projects.

D. Cost Estimates /1
3.11      The total cost of the Project, including physical and price
contingencies, is estimated at Rp35.6 billion equivalent to US$50.9 million,
including a foreign exchange cost of US$27.5 million equivalent, or
about 54% of the total cost. Taxes and duties are estimated at $0.5 mil-
lion equivalent. An abridged summary of the cost estimates is provided in
Table 3.2, and detailed Project cost estimates are provided in Annex 5.
3.12      The cost estimates for the physical works are based upon prelim-
inary designs for nine of the 13 BNA, and all of the IKK subprojects. Costs
are based upon information obtained from manufacturers, Iocal contractors
and suppliers, bid results of recent projects in East Java, and published
rates of various governmental agencies. The base costs are expressed in
January 1983 prices.  Physical contingencies have been estimated at 15%.
Price contingencies for local costs were estimated at 13% for 1983, 10% for
1984 and 7% per annum thereafter, and for foreign costs at 8% for 1983, 71/2%
for 1984 7% for 1985 and 6% thereafter.
3.13      The cost of consultants for project supervision, technical
assistance and training is estimated at US$5.6 million equivalent. This is
comprised of US$2.0 million equivalent for engineering and supervision
(about 7% of the cost of physical works), US$2.7 million for technical
assistance and US$0.9 million for the preparation of future projects. The
cost of consultants are based on 1,072 and 312 man-months of local and
foreign personnel, using an average total cost (including travel, subsis-
tence and overhead) per man-month of US$2,500 equivalent for local and
US$10,000 equivalent for foreign personnel.
E. Project Financing
3.14      A Bank loan to GOI of US$30.6 million equivalent would finance the
foreign exchange cost of the project, the capitalized front-end fee of about
US$0.08 million, and about $3.06 million in local cost. The Bank loan will
finance 60% of the total cost, excluding reserve procurement for vehicles
and motorcycles. The loan would be for a period of 20 years, including a
grace period of 5 years, at the standard variable rate of interest applied by
the Bank. GOI would provide the balance of Rp 14.2 billion ($20.4 million
equivalent) from its own resources as DIP funds (i.e., development budget
funds) to Cipta Karya by way of annual budgetary appropriations. Bank loan
and DIP funds will be provided as grants to the PDAMs in accordance with
Government policy. This policy is accepted for this Project but will be
reviewed under the cost recovery and financial study funded under the Project
(paras. 1.20 and 6.06). The funds needed in Rp billion are 0.20 in 1983, 5.22
in 1984, 6.52 in 1985, 1.70 in 1986 and 0.60 in 1987 (Table 3.2). Given the
normal time required to obtain reimbursement for withdrawal applications,
actual budgetary requirements of CK would be somewhat higher in the first
year. The financing plan is shown in Table 3.3.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANiGEMENTS
A. Project Management
4.01      The implementation arrangements for the Project follow a recently
adopted standardized model. The Directorate General of Cipta Karya, through
its Directorate of Sanitary Engineering (DSE), will have overall responsi-
bility for the Project and for international procurement. A Project
Management Unit (PMU), to be a part of the East Java office of the Ministry
of Public Works (Kantor Wilaya P.U.) and assisted by the East Java Office of
DSE, will manage and coordinate project activities. It will be responsible
for selecting sites, preparing designs and procurement documents, procuring
those goods and civil works covered under local procedures, supervising
construction, and coordinating all other project activities including assis-
tance to PDAMs studies and training (the latter of which will be provided by
DSE's East Java office). The staff of the PMU have been designated by CK
and the Provincial Government. Day-to-day implementation will be handled by
a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) working under the overall supervision of
PMU. The PIU will be headed by a project manager (an engineer has already
been designated), and will supervise subproject managers each of whom will
be responsible for a group of subprojects within a kotamadya or kabupaten.
The PMU and PIU will draw staff from Provincial Cipta Karya, the subproject
managers will be designated by the beneficiary PDAMs or kabupaten public
works office. (The establishment and staffing of both units would be a
condition of effectiveness.) The PMU and PIU will be assisted by consultants
for design, construction supervision and management.  The Ministry of Rome
Affairs, through its Directorate of Urban Development and Regional



- 19 -
Autonomy, will assist on policy matters and in dealings with the provincial
and local governments. Table 4.1 and Chart 4 depict these arrangements.
4.02      On December 29, 1982 the Provincial and Central Government entered
into an agreement which sets forth their respective obligations with regard
to (a) implementation of the physical, institutional and training aspects of
the Project; (b) establishing the Project Implementation Unit and providing
it with necessary staff and other resources; (c) ensuring that the
beneficiary kabupatens are provided support in fulfilling their obligations
for project implementation and establishing and developing PDAMs; and (d)
participating in the studies concerning the tariffs and monitoring of PDAMs
(paras. 1.24 and 6.11, and Item 2.C of Project File).
B. Implementation Schedule
4.03      Procurement actions for goods under the Project began in October
1982 when the Bank approved a first draft document to purchase pipes, meters
and service connections. This first contract, which is a critical path item
for pipelaying, was advertised in January 1983 and first deliveries are
expected in the second quarter of 1984 after which pipelaying will begin
with the following exception. At negotiations CK stated that it intends to
expedite some works by using selected materials on hand. These meet the
technical specifications approved under the Project, and would be replaced
subsequently by materials procured under the Project. Civil works (such as
buildings and reservoirs) which are not dependent upon separately procured
goods or which will incorporate material on hand will begin in mid-1983./l
Initial works (which would enable the delivery of some water service) would
be completed in the last half of 1984, and all work would be complete by
1987.  Chart 5 shows the project implementation activities and schedule and
Annex 6 describes the overall implementation program.
C. Project Supervision
4.04      The main responsibility for project supervision will necessarily
rest with Government, because of the numerous project activities and records,
and because physical works are numerous, widely scattered and inaccessible.
Experience with the first water supply project implemented by DSE indicate
the need to strengthen the project monitoring and supervision function at
DSE headquarters, and for this (among other) purpose a resident management
advisor was appointed under the second water supply loan. Because of the
increasing numbers of projects in recent years, it has become apparent that
supervision must be decentralized from Jakarta. For this Project the PMU
has been dLesignated by GOI to be responsible for supervision. To this end
it will issue semiannual reports (to be copied to the Bank) which would
contain, among other things:
/1  Advance contracting and retroactive finance are not involved because
loan signing is expected to occur prior to the signing of contracts.

the staffing and work of the PMIJ, PIU and the consultants;
- the status of training;
- project accounts and audits;
- project progress and identified bottlenecks;
- the status of land acquisition and the procurement of
consultants, equipment and civil works;
- the latest cost estimates, the status of GOI budgeting and
Bank loan disubursements, and the availability of Rupiah
counterpart funds;
the status of studies (see Annex 3), and their recommendations;
-  any proposed subproject substitutions or replacements; and
- special review of subprojects which exceed US$65 and US$50 per
capita for BNA and IKK respective, or which use river water sources.
D. Procurement
4.05      Civil works to be implemented under the Project estimated at
US$16 million excluding contingencies would be widely dispersed, labor
intensive, of small scale and therefore not suitable for ICB. IKK civil
works contracts would average less than US$100,000 each, BNA contracts, less
than US$500,000 although about two contracts would may be slightly more than
US$1 million. Therefore civil works would be bid in accordance with GOI
procurement regulations using standardized documents which are satisfactory
to the Bank.  They would be packaged to enable small contractors to partici-
cipate individually, and to attract large local contractors or joint
ventures of smaller firms to bid for groups of contracts.
4.06      Equipment and materials with an estimated value of US$14.8 million
(excluding contingencies) to be procured under the Project include pipes,
fittings, well screens, casings, pumps, meters and chlorination and well
drilling equipment. Vehicles including motorcycles will be subject to
reserve procurement because Government restricts their importation.
Equipment and materials required in small lots or on an urgent basis, valued
individually at less than $100,000 and totalling less than US$2.0 million,
would be procured through GOI procedures acceptable to the Bank. All
remaining equipment and supply would be procured under ICB. Local
manufacturers would be granted a preference of 15% of the CIT price of
imported goods, or the customs duty, which ever is lower.



- 22 -
4.07      Contract Review.  No prior review of civil works procurement
documentation by the Bank is proposed because: (a) all civil works
contracts are individually small and will be let on thes basis of local
procedures; and (b) Bank emphasis has been to review and agree on the local
procedures to be followed and the standard contract documents to be used;
not much is to be gained through contract by contract reviews. Bank
supervision missions will, however, conduct random post review. All bidding
packages for equipment and materials over US$200,000 equivalent would be
subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement documentation.  This would
cover about 95% of the total value of goods.
E. Disbursements
4.08      Disbursements would be made at the rate of 100% of the foreign
expenditures for directly imported goods, 95% of local expenditures (ex-
factory) for goods manufactured locally and procured under international
competitive bidding, and 65% of local expenditures for imported goods which
are procured under local procedures. Disbursements for consultant services,
training specialists, and overseas training would be at: 100% of
expenditures. Disbursements for civil works contracts would be at 45% of
cost on the basis of periodic statements of expenditures submitted by GOI.
There would be no disbursements for motorcycles and vehicles. The proposed
allocation of loan proceeds is given in Annex 7, Table 1. The loan would be
disbursed over the period December 1983-June 1989 and June 30, 1989 is the
proposed Closing Date (Annex 7, Table 2). Historical disbursement profiles
for Indonesia are longer than projected for this Project, however because
final designs are in progress, procurement actions have begun and the
systems are relatively simple, an accelerated profile is appropriate.
4.09      In the event that the amounts to be disbursed total less than the
amount of the loan, the unused balance would be disbursed, as approved by
the Bank, against the purchase of goods and civil works; for the East Java
water supply program, additional consulting services, cr the continuation
of the training program.
F. Project Accounts and Audits
4.10      Project accounts would be maintained by the PMU and PIU showing,
for each contract, itemized expenditures based on measured units of work
certified by the supervising engineer. DSE has an established system of
project accounting which is satisfactory and it will introduce this to
the PMU. During negotiations assurances were obtained that project accounts
satisfactory to the Bank would be maintained, that project accounts and
statements of expenditures would be audited by GOI's Directorate General
for State Financial Control or others satisfactory to the Bank, and that the
audits would be made available to the Bank within seven months of the end of
the fiscal year.  The audit of PDAMs is discussed in para. 6.10.

V. POPULATION, SERVICE AND DEMLiD
A.  Present Water Service
5.01      At present eight of the proposed 50 beneficiary cities and towns
have public water systems, the balance depend variously on individual shallow
or deep wells, springs or river sources. Both the public and non-public sys-
tems are tenuous water sources because they are generally unreliable, both in
terms of quantity and quality. Most of the public systems are old, have leak-
age of 30% of more, and only serve from 2 to 8% of the population. All are in
need of expansion, and most, because of poor upkeep, require extensive repair
or replacement of equipment. Although house connections are generally
metered, about half of the meters are out of service.
B. Population Served and Service Levels
5.02      Twelve BNA cities and 37 IKK towns located within eight Kabupatens
and one Kotamadya are the beneficiaries of the Project. The assumptions made
in estimating water demand for the individual PDAM's are listed in Annex 8 and
are summarized in Table 5.1 below:

5.03      The Project will largely serve residential customers who will
recive 89% of total connections and 80% of the total consumption.  Half of
the beneficiaries would be urban poor, and about 46% of the total water
consumption will go to families with low and moderate income with water
consumption at 30 lpcd to 80 lpcd. About 60% of the residential house
connections are assumed to use less than 15 cu m per month, and none are
assumed to use more than 30 cu m per month. The original project objectives
set in 1980 were to achieve the 60% target of population served in 1986.
Under the revised construction schedule, and because of a downward estimate
for the rate of connections, this objective would be achieved by 1988. The
estimated demands are outgrowths of the planning and design criteria for the
BNA and IKK programs (para. 3.07 and Annex 4), but there is some risk that
the pace of house connections may be slower than planned, while the
consumption for some connections may be higher (para.  7.08).
C. Project Area and Service Area
5.04      it has not proved possible to lay down a single, simple definition
of the project area, since there is generally no town boundary which can be
used; if kecamatan boundaries were used, the project areas would generally
be too large and would cover low density rural areas. Hience, based on
engineering judgement, settlements within a reasonable reach of the town
(i.e., those to which the distribution system could eventually be extended,
say by year 1990) have been included as part of the project area.
Topographical features, population densitites, the views of Government
officials and future development plans have all been considered where these
are relevant to the project.
5.05      The 60% of people in the project area who will actually be supplied
generally comprise those where the service can be provided in the most
cost-effective manner. This is normally achieved by allocating supplies to
the town centre and the most densely populated parts of the town, and then
working outwards until the 60% figure is reached. This general policy has
been modified to take into account existing water supplies and sanitation
arrangements; for example, areas where the existing health hazards of
waterborne disease appear to be above average have been given priority.
Modifications have also been made where there is an unwillingness expressed
by the local people and desa officials to receive a piped supply.
5.06      On the above basis, a  service area' is defined to include all
the people who will receive the piped supply either by individual connections
or by standpipe. In certain situations (such as along a transmission main
supplying a town) households which are not in the project area can be
supplied at very low cost and source and transmissions works have been sized
accordingly. Similar provisions have been made for communities whose
existing water supplies are endangered by proposed spriqn  or wellfield
developments for the Project; in general standpipe installations are
provided for these communities.

D. Population and Demand Projections
5.07          Population  projections  were made  by  the  consultants  using  census
data. For each subproject the area to be served encompasses about 60% of
the area's total population (in accordance with the BNA planning criterion)
and is selected so facilities are provided in the most cost-effective
manner, usually the more densely populated town centers. The demand assumed
for various types of connections is shown in Table 3.1. It is likely that
unconstrained demand would exceed these allocations, but under the design
criteria BNA house connections would be metered and the progressive tariff
structure is expected to inhibit excess consumption. For IKK systems demand
will be limited by flow restrictors inserted in the service pipeline. The
demand summary for the eight PDAMs is given in Table 5.1., a typical demaind
analysis is in Annex 9, and the consolidated demand for each PDAM showing
the population served by house connectiorts and standpipes is in the financial
projections (Annex 10) and the monitoring indicator tables (Annex 12).
5.08          Under  the  Project  the  population with water  will  increase  from
7,100 to  796,000,  the  percentage  of  population  served  will  go  from  4.8%o
to 47.7%, the number of connections will increase 6 times and the volume
produced 4 times (Table 5.2). Compared to the volume of water per connec-
tion or per capita presently provided by the existing systems, after project
completion the unit volume will be reduced, in keeping with the objective to
provide smaller quantities of water to each person, but to extend service to
far more people.

VI.  FINANICIAL ANALYSIS
A. Existing Water Enterprises
6.01      Until recently water supply in Indonesia was operated by each
city, either as a department or as a PDAHI. But now that hundreds of new and
smaller systems are being built, their operations will be consolidated under
PDAMs which will be responsible for all systems within a kabupaten. This
is expected to provide economies of scale, better use of scarce human
resources, enable cross subsidization from the larger and wealthier cities
to the surrounding smaller towns, and reduce the level of tariffs required
to cover operating expenses. Malang, Madiun, Mojokerto, Sampang and
Sidoarjo have established PDAMs./l Situbondo has a temporary water enter-
prise operated by DSE, but this is scheduled for conversion to a PDAM.
Tuban and Tulungagung do not have water supply systems but PDAMs would be
established before project completion. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that PDAMs would be established and staffed in the kabupatens
of Tuban and Tulungagung, and the temporary enterprise in Situbondo converted
to a PDAM, not later than December 31, 1984. Assurances were also be
obtained that assets provided under the Project will be inventoried and
transferred to the respective PDAMs shortly after construction is completed.
B.  Past Finances
6.02      There are no financial statements available for the periods when
the eight existing systems were operated as departments of their respective
kabupaten, and other than in Madiun the financial statements; for 1981 are
also not available. Statements were post-ante constructed by the consult-
ants and the chief accountant of each PDAM and are used as a starting point
for projections of future performance. Although the reliability of this
information is limited, it is not expected to affect the overall projections
since the future systems will be either totally new or many times larger
than the present systems.
6.03      The systems under operation in 1981 (with some exceptions for
Madiun, which has a better performance) share the following characteristics:
(a) accounting is on a cash rather than an accrual basis;
(b) financial information is limited and produced with long delay;
(c) the record of fixed assets is very limited;
(d)  depreciation is calculated but not incorporated in the accounting
records;
/1 Malang in June 1981, Madiun in March 1978, Mojokerto in January 1982,
Sampang in May 1980, Sidoarjo in July 1982.



- 27 
(e) billing and collection is satisfactory with receivables at about
10% of billing, mostly resulting from six-month delays in payments
by government offices;
(f) operations are subsidized by government in Madiun, Sampang and
Situbondo (payment of some salaries) but some cash surpluses are
produced in Malang and Mojokerto;
(g) labor productivity is low, 20 to 33 employees serve 1,000
connections, whereas a target of 10 is recommended by the
consultants for the overall PDAM (individual systems, especially
the small IKKs, may have a higher ratio, see Annex 11, Table 1);
(h) most connections are metered but many meters do not work;
(i) high charges and stringent payments terms for the installation
of house connections discourage connection applications;
(k) no guidance or assistance is provided in technical, financial
or managerial aspects; and
(k) although average tariffs are low in absolute terms (US$0.11
per cu m) they are not cheap considering the low level of service
provided.
C. Tariff Structure
6.04      In the mid 1970s DSE issued a Guideline for Tariff Structure which
prescribed unit price ratios for various consumer groups and levels of conr-
sumption. The guidelines are being revised jointly by Cipta Karya and
Ministry of Home Affairs to reduce the monthly consumption base from 15 to
10 cu m, and increase the progressivity for consumption above the base.
Standpipe consumers will pay 80% of the minimum unit tariff for house connec-
tions and IKK house connections will have flow limiting devices and be
charged at a fixed rate.  The ratios prescribed in the guidelines are not
mandatory and individual PDAMs are free to adjust them as long as they take
into account their obligation to meet the revenue covenant (para. 6.05).
GOI discussed with the Bank the proposed revised guidelines and agreed that
they would be further reviewed as a part of the tariff study.  The recommen-
dations of this study will be incorporated as appropriate in the national
guideline for tariff structure by December 31, 1984.
D. Revenue Covenant /1
6.05      Present service in the eight water systems under operation is
limited to a few thousand persons, with water rationed most of the day.
The existing PDAMs are financially weELk and their staff are inefficient and
untrained. Given the time required to bring about institutional improvement
/1 See footnote page 11.

and training, and the relative large size of new works compared to existing
facilities, normal financial covenants would not be meaningful before the
new works enter into operation. Agreement was reached during negotiations
that the minimum tariff for residential connections will be increased to
Rp 50 per cu m starting in mid-1983, and that consumption aLbove this level,
and the consumption of other users will be charged the progressive rates
established in DSE's Tariff Guideline. According to current Government
policy, PDAM's providing basic needs services must generate sufficient
revenues to at least cover operation, maintenance and depreciation costs.
Agreement was reached during negotiations that tariff and other revenues in
the Project PDAMs will be at least sufficient to cover operation, mainte-
nance and depreciation on revalued fixed assets staring in 1985. Since the
PDAMs have no previous debt service, and the Government and the Bank are
financing 100% of the capital expenditures, this would ensure that each PDAM
is financially viable, and the depreciation allowance will generate cash for
working capital or minor expansions. Agreement was also reached that the
depreciation allowance will be used exclusively for improvements or expan-
sions of the water systems or to pay debt service if recommended under the
tariff study. The average and minimum tariffs required to comply with the
revenue covenant are shown in Table 6.1. The average tariff (in 1983
prices) required in 1988 to meet this requirement would be Rp 94 per cu m
(US$0.13 per cu m).

6.06       Analysis by Bank staff indicate a tariff policy wh:ich achieves a
greater level of cost recovery could be adopted without affecting afforda-
bility for low-income persons.   The Government ias agreed to study cost
recovery potentials and this would proVide an input to formulating cost
recovery policies for the sector during Repelita IV.  Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that constultants, under TOR acceptable to the
Bank, will make a study based on the eight beneficiary PDAMis of tariffs that
would produce satisfactory level of financial performance as well as capital
cost recovery while remaining affordab'Le to consumers. The study should
show how capital payback could help to finance further sector investments
(possibly through a revolving fund) ani recommend mec_hanisms for the
collection and reinvestmenit of fu ids a3  either the national, grovincial or
kabupaten level.  I'he recommendations of tne study would be discussed with
the Bank and incorporated as appropriate in GOI's policies for urban water
supply development and in the national guidelines for tariff s-ructure by
December 31, 1984.  The specific recommeindations concerning the beneficiary
PDAM's would be implemenited by June 30, 1 985
6.07       Affordability./l  The averags 1988 tarifEf f'or indi-,;idual PDAMs
would vary from Rp 66 to Rp 11.1 per cu m.  Given the progressivIty of the
tariff structure the charges for the minimum consumjpt-ion of 1.0 cu m per
mionth would average Rp 59 per cu m (Rp 42 to .'0 per cu -m) or about US$ 0.85
per family per month.  The highest tariff is e xpected ir. Sampang where the
umonthly expenditures for stardpipe serv ice (Rp 224           4 cu -a per month)
wjould average only 1% of the families g-th the lowest reported income (Rp
20,000, Annex 14).  Only 30% of the total population is expected initially
to have house connections, but the month1ly cahages for house connections (Rp
590) would amount to only 3% of the m.inimum reported income per family, and
less than 2% for families within the lowest 20%.' income f(Rp 30,000 per
month).  Thus wateir charges will be below the range commonly consldered
affordable, i.e., .3-7% for average families and about 2% for low-income
families.  Excessive water demand and usage will be constrained by price
lewhen connections are metered) and by flow restrictors elsewhere.
6.08       Although initially onLy about 30% of the population is expected
tLo be provided with house connections, the government wants to promote
greater use of house connections.  It is therefore imporLant to 'fimit the
charge for nouse connections to its actual cost, and to provi de payment
facilities for connections. Assurances have been obtained that the charge
for the installation of domestic service connections would not exceed the
actual average cost and consumers would be permitted to pay for co-nnections
over three to five years.
/1  See footnote page 1L,  Prior to the devaluation, it -w7as calcul-ated that
the average tariff required in 19883 (in 1983 prices), to comply with the
covenant would be about Rp 94 per cu , ($0,13/cu_ mn).  Preli-minary indi-
cations are that tariff levels in 1;988 prices would bie about Rp 101
($0.11) per cu m in 1983 prices, cr about 7% higher tkhan shown in this
report,well within the capacity of even the poorest consumers to pay.

6.09      Future Finances.  The projections (Annex 10) fo  the beneficiary
PDAMs consolidate the finances of the 50 subprojects plus some small systems
presently under operation.  They were prepared by Bank staff under assump-
tions given in Annex 11, and are based on selectively modified feasibility
report data (Document B.1 of Project File). The PDAMs may require start-up
subsidies in their early years of operation (as their systemz gear up to
full capacity) and allowances for this have been included in project costs.
Under the proposed revenue covenant (para. 6.05) the financial position of-
all PDAMs will be satisfactory when the new assets enter into operation in
1986.  Some selected financial data are shown in Table 6.2.
E. Reporting Requirements
6.10      In order to permit the satisfactory monitoring of project progress
by DSE, CK, Ministry of Home Affairs and the East Java Governor, assurances
were obtained during negotiations that:
(a)  starting with the period July-December L983, ses.i-annual reports
would be prepared by the Project Management Unit (PAU) covering:
(i) the status of project cost and implementation, land
acquisition and contracts, and (ii) statistical data for each
PDAM on the number of connections, volume sold and produced,
tariff and other revenues, operating expenses, number of
employees, average tariffs, number of days of accounts receivable,
and working ratio./l Copies of the reports should be sent to the
Bank within two months of the end of the reporting period;
(b)  Under the direction of the PMU, the PDAMs will establish and
maintain an accrual accounting system, these accounts will be
accessible to the Bank, will be audited annually commencing for
FY 1984 by GOI's Directorate General for State Financiaal Control
or others satisfactory to the Bank, and the Audit Report will be
sent to DSE, CX, Ministry of Home Affairs and the Bank not later
than June 30 of the following year; and
(c) CK will prepare a Project Completion Report, satisfactory to ttie
Bank, not later than 6 months after the closing date.
F. Governor's Instructions
6.11      The beneficiary PDAMs are autonomous water enterprises under their
respective kabupaten or kotamadya governments.  To ensure full participation
by the local governments and water enterprises, the Governor has issued
instructions to them which contain:

VII. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Justification
7.01      The population density of Java is higher, the poverty is greater,
and the water availability is less than elsewhere in Indonesia. External
assistance for Java's water supply development is allocated by agreement
with Government to the Dutch, the ADB and the Bank, who operate in West,
Central and East Java Provinces respectively. The proposed Project will
meet the basic water supply needs of the population in priority cities and
towns. The Project's systems are designed for low cost and rapid implement-
ation, and reaeh the poor at affordable prices.
7.02      Raising the health and living standards of the population is the
main purpose of the Project, but emphasis is also placed in the achievement
of sound institutional and financial policies for the sector, the strength-
ening of DSE and other sector institutions and the establishment of
financially viable and effectively managed PDAMs. The individual sub-
projects represent the least cost method for providing basic water service.
7.03      Marginal Cost.  The long-term marginal cost for water was esti-
mated using long-run Average Incremental Cost (AIC) at a LO% discount rate.
The AIC for the eight PDAM's is estimated (in 1983 prices) at Rp 191 per cu
m compared with the covenanted average tariff (in 1983 pr:ices) at Rp 87 per
cu m. The large disparity in the average tariff and the AIC is because a
large proportion (46%) of the water sales are to low-income consumers for
whom low tariffs are maintained as a matter of policy. Government expects
that low tariffs would promote the use of safe water to people who would
otherwise rely on unsafe alternative sources. However, under the tariff
structure guidelines (para. 6.04) charges for commercial, industrial and
residential users consuming more than 30 cu m per month would exceed AIC.
Higher tariffs than those proposed are not considered feasible until
consumer confidence in the new system is established.

7.04      Rates of Return.  Rates of return were calculated for each PDAM by
aggregating subprojects within its boundaries. Aggregation is appropriate
because the tariffs are uniform within each PDAM and there are no signifi-
canLt difLerences in the per capita cost of individual subprojects. Economic
rates of return (ERR) were calculated using the water charges paid at
present by consumers for purchases from water vendors for up to 15 lpcd, and
using average water charges for higher consumption as a surrogate of benefits.
ERR's so calculated average 4% and range from 3-6%. A 20% increase in
capital costs with an unchanged benefit stream would reduce the average ERR
to 3%, and with a 5% reduction in the benefit stream, would yield an average
ERR of 2% (Annex 16).  These calculations are not, however, a fair measure
of the economic rate of return because it does not adequately capture exter-
nalities (such as health benefits) which accrue to the community at large or
the benefits which result from the new systems for the present users in the
form of improved service. The low rates of return indicate economic
justification for higher tariffs, but this is not adopted at present because
the Government wants to promote community acceptance of safe, publicly
supplied water. The justification for the project does not rest with the
rate of return, but rather that it at least cost provides essential and safe
water supply service to a here-to-fore unserved population (more than half
of whom are poor), will help to improve the health and living standards of
the population and provides the means for strengthening sector institutions
and policies (paras. 7.01-7.03).

7.05      Population Benefited and Urban Poverty Impact.  The Project will
benefit about 720,000 people by 1988 through house connections and standpipes
(Table 7.2). The level of population served in the PDAMs will be increased
ten times, while present users will have improved water quality, service
pressure and reliability. Ninety-one percent of the total connections and 80%
of the distributed water will be for households, with government, commercial,
social and industrial users receiving the balance.

/b  Since there is no water services in Tuban and Tulungagung this ratio
will be infinite. For comparative purposes the average level existing
in Mojokerto and Situbondo (4%) was used for those two cities.
7.06      About 56% of the population in the beneficiary towns are below the
relative poverty level for Indonesia./l Because of the nearly uniform
distribution of population of different incomes across each city and town,
about 50% of the population served, or some 360,000 persons, would be poor
(Table 7.2).

7.07      The expected level of average water charges and the minimum charges
for house connections and standpipes is shown in Table 6.1. Under the
proposed tariff level and structure water service would be affordable to all
of the population, although only 60% would actually receive water services
at this time (para. 6.07).
B. Project Risks
7.08      Project risks are as follows:
(a)  The Provincial Cipta Karya and kabupaten staff have never
carried out water supply projects of the scope covered by this
Project, and how well they will perform is unknown. The risk
is mitigated by the establishmeni: of a Project Management Unit
which will draw upon more experienced staff and consulting
advisors, and the support to be given the PMU by Cipta Karya and
DSE.
(b)  Some design features are innovative and have not been extensively
tried in Indonesia. The purpose is to reduce costs, speed project
implementation and make service available to the poor. But it is
not known if there will be functional problems or reluctance by
consumers to accept this technology. The systems have been used
in the Philipines, and are now being installed in West Java where
they will be tested. During project execution consultants would
evaluate the design criteria and field performance of this
technology and make recommendations on its improvement (para.
3.07). If necessary and feasible, the designs will be modified
under the Project, and further improvements will be made in future
projects. The low cost of using these designs and the reasonable
certainty that they will work justifies the risk.
(c)  Most of the prospective consumers presently obtain their water
from rivers and shallow wells. It is sometimes difficult to wean
people away from these traditional sources, and there is some risk
that the Project will be underutilized. This risk is reduced
because during project preparation, the community leaders were
consulted by the project preparation teams to determine if they
wanted a new system (and were willing to pay the water charges),
and because the systems are nominally designed to serve only 60%
of the population. On the other side there is the risk that the
Project will be too successful, that is, that demand will rapidly
exceed available supply because the systems are designed to serve
only 60% of the population with only 60 lpcd. This would result
in short supply and the early need for further investments.  Under
the proposed revenue covenant, however, some excess cash would be
generated and this could be applied toward system improvement.



- 36 -
(d) Finally there is the substantial risk that the systems will not be
effectively and efficiently operated and maintained. Although
operation of the facilities is relatively simple, the PDAMs are
new and inexperienced in operations, staff are new and must be
trained, and sound public utility practices have to be introduced
and accepted. The training and institutional development of the
PDAMs, and the mechanisms to be established to provide assistance
and control of the PDA1s, mitigate this risk.
C. Environmental Impact
7.09      Because it provides safe, potable water the Project will have a
positive environmental impact and improve, the quality of life of persons in
the beneficiary cities and towns. During construction there will be some
disruption of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and earth excavation will
increase sediment loads of storm water runoff, but these will be temporary
situations without major detrimental effects. After project completion the
volume of wastewater will increase, but this will be limited by virtue of
the low capacity of the water supply system; the expect volumes will be
readily handled by existing storm water canals and drains.  Moreover some
wastewater will probably be used for watering gardens and controlling dust.
The quality of the wastewater will not be obnoxious: it would at worst be
wash and laundry water and free of fecal matter. Water-borne fecal systems
do not exist, nor are they expected to come into being because of cost and
the limited flushing water volume available to households. Pourflush
latrines and pit privies are the commonly adopted methods for fecal waste
handling, and these are supported by government KIP and INPRES programs (see
para. 3.06).
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from GOI that:
(a) each PDAM will receive organization, management and accounting
assistance and will participate in training programs (para. 1-.24);
(b) DSE would arrange for a review of BNA and IKK design criteria
(para. 3.07);
(c) project accounts would be maintained and audited, and the audits
would be made available to the Bank (para. 4.10);
(d) service connections would be provided with meters or flow
restrictors, and the charge for domestic connections would not
exceed their average cost and be payable over three to five years
(para. 6.08).



- 37 -
(e) PDAMs would be established in Tuban, Tulungagung and Situbondo by
December 31, 1984 (para. 6.01);
(f) assets provided under the Project would be inventoried and trans-
ferred to the PDMIs within six months after commissioning
(para. 6.01);
(g) tariff guidelines would be reviewed and revised as appropriate
by December 31, 1984 (para. 6.04);
(h)  operational revenues of the beneficiary PDAMs will cover opera-
tion, maintenance and depreciation by 1985 and the depreciation
allowance would be used exclusively for water systems (para.
6.05); and
(i) a study would be undertaken of tariffs and mechanisms for cost
recovery and the agreed recommendations would be implemented in
Repelita IV (para. 6.06).
8.02       Subject to the above, the Project is suitable for a Bank loan of
US$30.6 million equivalent, for a term of 20 years including a grace period
of five years.

FIRST EAST JAVA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Training
Current Arrangements
A.        Training support for the urban water supply sector is provided by
the Sub-Directorate for Development (SDD) of DSE. SDD's training resources
comprise four main sections covering, respectively, management development,
technical development, laboratory, and training implementation. The
training implementation section includes a reasonably well equipped
residential training center for the provision of classroom instruction.
Except for a training laboratory, which is little used, there are no
facilities for the provision of practizal skills training.
2.        SDD's training repertoire comprises about ten standard course
programs broadly covering the subject areas of general, financial and
technical management of PDAMs, the supervision of water treatment and
distribution operations, and construction supervision. Most of these
courses are assembled into an annual training program geared to meet, to
the extent possible, the priority training needs of existing PDAMs and
those in process of being developed to PDAM status (BPAMs). Limited
training support is also provided to st'aff operating water systems being
developed under the IKK program. Standard training courses have been
offered at SDD's central training faci'Lity throughout the 1970s. Since
1979, the program has been increasingly decentralised to the provinces
through arrangements made with the development staff of DSE's provincial
offices (PABs). SDD's main training role, is therefore, to plan and
administer this annual program, and provide "software" support which
currently comprises an incomplete set of training manuals. The actual
delivery of the standard training programs is contracted to one of a panel
of local consultants most of whom are sanitary engineers but none appears
to have received substantial training .In the skills of training.
3.        The annual training program for FY1982/83 is given at Appendix I
to this Annex. Within the budgetary and staffing limitations of SDD, and
the extent to which PAB development staff can assist, the training program
for FY1983/84 is targetted to train a naximum of 2000 PDAM staff.  This
will represent about a threefold increase over the numbers trained during
FY 1982/83 but, without commensurate st:rengthening of SDD's training
resources for FY 1983/84, is unlikely t:o be realised.
Sector Manpower and Training Forecasts
4.        SDD has estimated that, currently, there are approximately 300
urban water supply systems in operation employing some 14,000 staff. In
the longer term (to 1990) GOI service targets for the water supply and



- 44 -                         ANNEX 2
Page 2
sanitation decade (as given in Section I of this report) would indicate
that the range of possible staffing requirements could be between 26,000 to
62,000. For indicative purposes a median figure of 44,000 staff is assumed
to represent the total staffing complement required for both BNA and IKK
programs at 1990. Allowing for existing staff and assuming linear growth
during the period to 1990, an annual sector recruitment rate of some 3,750
is indicated. The staff attrition rate for the urban water sector is
currently below 1.0% and is not expected to increase markedly over the
period. No allowance has therefore been made for this factor.
Project Manpower and Training Forecasts
5.        Using similar guidelines to those employed by SDD to develop
sector manpower forecasts, for the East Java Project DSE estimates that the
total staff required for beneficiary cities and towns will be 726 by 1987.
This represents an increase of about 100% over existing staffing levels.
SDD has prepared quite detailed manpower projections for East Java Province
as a whole, and is in the process of refining these data using the new MDP
Manpower Classification System (MCS). The SDD manpower projections for the
Province indicate an annual average training load of about 400 PDAM staff
(including IKK systems) over the period 1983-1990. Thie inference is that
if the proposed East Java Project is to address the toltal provincial urban
water sector manpower and training need, as opposed to project related
needs, an additional 1650 staff would be trained under the Project by 1987.
Training Strategy
6.        Recognising the inadequacy of current urban water supply training
support to meet this order-of-magnitude training load iFor new PDAM staff,
SDD has, since 1980, been attempting to accelerate the decentralization of
training services. The strategy is to build up local training capability,
province by province, with the focal point for training being, initially,
the development staff of PABs, but shifting in the longer term to become
the responsibility of provincial Cipta Karya. To assist the implementation
of this strategy, a Manpower Development Program (MDP) was initiated in
1980, with technical assistance provided by the Netherlands and
administered by the International Reference Center (IRC) for Community
Water Supply. The objective of the MDP/IRC was to lay the foundations for
the gradual development of a national training system for the urban water
sector as a whole. Initial concentration was to be upon 12 selected
provinces which would include those receiving bilateral and multilateral
donor assistance. Developmental activities of the MDPJ'IRC were targetted
to train regional (PAB) development assistants as trainers for the
provinces, devise a model MCS, prepare centrally produced "modular"1/
training materials, and provide training support and advisory services to
embryo provincial training units (PTUs).
1/   Training Module:  Training based upon building up knowledge and
skill in task-related units, as needed by an individual. A
training module could comprise both off and on-the-job training
elements and, possibly, an education element.



- 45 -                            ANNEX 2
Page 3
7.        Due to management and staffing problems, the MDP/IRC has achieved
only partial success and there is no apparent plan for the Netherlands to
continue support for this program beyond mid-1983. In February 1982 the
MDP/IRC was modified to be used primarily to re-inforce the implementation
of standard training courses offered annually by the SDD Training Section.
Responsibility for the production of MDP training materials was transferred
to a production team comprising of consortia of Dutch consulting firms
(DHV, TGI and IWACO) who will complete a first batch of 25 training manuals
(comprising 217 modules, or one-half of the total number required), by
mid-January 1983. Upon completion of this task, and the completion of the
Netherlands assisted Eleven Cities training project in July 1983, other
than training support for IKK schemes, Netherlands funding for urban water
sector manpower development may be halted.
Proposed East Java Project Training Component
8.        Cipta Karya's training strategy for the urban water sector is
consistent with GOI policy to promote regional autonomy through development
projects and, also, with the Bank's aim to assist institutional development
within the sector. Although a substantial sector-oriented training
component was included in the Bank-financed Second Water Supply Project
(Loan 1709), implementation of the plan was deferred, at the request of
GOI, in order to allow the Netherlands funded MDP to take precedence.
9.        Therefore the training component of the First East Java Water
Supply Project is designed to continue, and further develop, the
implementation of Cipta Karya's training strategy for the urban water
supply sector. It is also designed to be integrated with the overall MPW
training strategy to establish a coordinated manpower development program.
To achieve this, the scope of the training component extends beyond meeting
the manpower and training needs associated with the subprojects in 13
cities and 37 IKK towns. It would additionally:
(a)  Establish a permanent provincial training unit (PTU) to be
developed, initially, as a training arm of the East Java PAB.
Although the PTU would give priority to assisting with the
recruitment and training needs of the Project beneficiary cities
and towns, manpower development services would also be available
to other BNA and IKK projects in the East Java Province. PTU
training services would contribute to the planning and design of
urban water supply development as well as meeting manpower and
training needs generated by construction, management, operation
and maintenance of water installations.Subject to appropriate
local modifications, the proposed PTU would be modelled upon the
successful PTU established by the Dutch consulting firm DHV at
Medan to support the North Sumatra Eleven Cities Project. The
East Java PTU would be developed with the view to its eventual
upgrading as one of the six Regional Training Centers2/ for the
urban water sector.
2/   In the longer term, (1985-90), Cipta Karya would consider
establishing regional training centers to support urban (and
possibly rural) water supply training, based at: North Sumatra
(Medan), South Sumatra (Palembang), West Java (Bandung), Mid-Java
(Semarang), East Java (Surabaya) and South Sulawesi (Ujung
Pandang).



- 46 -                        ANNEX 2
Page 4
(b) Strengthen SDD's ability to fulfill its role as the central
training resource for the urban water supply sector through the
provision of training services which would include, as a minimum:
(i)  the central provision of training courses, workshops and
seminars for urban and municipal PDAM managers and senior
staff;
(ii) implementation of the planned "crash" training program
through expansion of the existing SDD field training
program, to provide both and off and on-the-job training,
for the key staff of PDAMs and project management units
(PMU) (particularly construction supervisors) with priority
allocation to BNA and IKK programs in provinces not
supported by PTUs.
(iii) the development and commissioning of the currently
under-utilized central laboratory training facility;
(iv)  furtner development of the MDP to include the provision of
training advisory and support services to PTUs and, where
PTUs have not yet been established, to existing
regional/provincial training development staff;
(v)  installation of a manpower planning and forecasting service
incorporating, and refining in the light of experience, the
existing Manpower Classification System (MCS);
(vi) the provision a standard range of "training of trainers"
programs, covering appreciation seminars for PDAM/BPAM
managers, full-time PTU staff and instructors, regional/PAB
development assistants, BNA/IKK project management staff,
and local consultants retained to assist with the
implementation of SDD training courses;
(vii) further development of the MCS to include a battery of
experimental skill/aptitude tests and selection criteria to
assist with the recruitment of PDAM staff; and
(viii) the establishment of a central training media development
function to continue the work of the MIDP production team
currently comprising a consortia of Dutchconsultants; and
(c) Provide the means to extend Cipta Karya's training strategy
elsewhere in the urban water sector by developing, concurrent
with the East Java PTU, a "pre-construction" training program in
one, or more, provinces to be selected by DSE (for example, South
Sulawesi). This would lead to, and assist, the planned and
timely establishment of additional PTUs capable of meeting
training needs generated by the construction, operation and
maintenance phases of urban water supply development in the
selected provinces.



- 47 -                      ANNEX 2
Page 5
10.       Achievement of these broader training objectives would make
substantial progress towards the implementation of Cipta Karya's training
strategy for the urban water sector. Regional/provincial training
resources would, by 1987, be permanently established in East Java and South
Sulawesi and North Sumatra/Aceh and West Java. Moreover, the central role
and resources of SDD would be strengthened to facilitate the development of
additional PTUs at Palembang (serving South Sumatra) and Semarang (serving
Central Java). The next Bank-financed project for urban water sector
development could assist in the completion of this aspect of the sector
training plan so that, by about 1990, the first six regional/provincial
training centers would be established.
Training Program Content and Related Data
11.       Data is available in the project files covering:
(a) Training program curricula and job descriptions for seven key
PDAM staff positions;
(b) Training curricula and job descriptions for Regional/Provincial
Manpower Development Assistants;
(c) Guidelines for staffing and training project management unit
personnel;
(d) Outline specification and staffing profile for a typical PTU; and
(e) Subject areas to be covered by 60 training manuals currently
being prepared by the MDP Production team, together with the
breakdown of manuals into constituent "task-specific" training
modules.
Cost Estimate
12e       The total cost of the project training component, including
approximately 110 man-months of technical assistance, is estimated to be
US$2.0 million with a foreign exchange component of US$1.5 million. This
budget estimate is based upon the following assumptions:
(a) the cost of preparing the 35 additional training manuals required
to complete the full set of 60 manuals identified by the MDP
production team, would have been met by uncommitted training
funds in Loan 1709-IN; and
(b) the Netherlands technical assistance for training support to the
urban water sector would focus more upon the IKK Program in
provinces not covered by the proposed East Java Water Supply
Project training component.
The cost breakdown of the proposed training component is given at Appendix
2 of this Annex.

4.        Tariffs, Financial Viability, Cost Recovery and Affordability.
Using the beneficiary PDAMs as case studies, analyze the required average
tariffs and tariff structure which would generate funds for operation,
maintenance, and different levels of capital pay-back, all while keeping
tariffs at levels which are affordable to the poor (by way of cross subsidy
and unit price tariffs which increase with volume used). Prepare revised
financial projections and show how cost recovery can reduce the Government s
financial burden or increase water supply development. Identify appropriate
mechanisms for recovery costs (for example, by financing investments with
loans under different terms) and appropriate recipients for the recovered
capital funds (i.e., central, provincial or kabupaten governments). To be
done in conjunction with Item 3, PDAM Institutional Development. No
specific man-month allocation.

EAST JAVA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Planning and Design Criteria
I. Planning Criteria
A. Selection of Beneficiary Towns
The beneficiary towns were sel.ected by Cipta Karya in consultation
with the Ministry of Home Affairs and provincial officials. Factors
considered in selecting towns were: simplicity (favoring towns easily
supplied by ground or spring waters); population size (favoring the larger
towns); need (favoring places which have not received earlier support from
Government for water supply and/or where incidence of waterborne disease or
poverty is high); other Government programs (where water would contribute to
other development efforts); and the poltential for economic growth. If in the
course of the Project substitute towns are proposed, they would fulfill the
above criteria.
B. Existing Systems
Existing facilities would be integrated into proposed systems where
expected service life justifies and abandoned if expectations are for high
leakage, operating costs or repair frequency. Existing systems in the BNA
cities of M4adiun, Batu and Kapangen will be integrated. There are no existing
systems in IKK towns.
C. Project and Service Area
The physical objective is to provide an average domestic supply of
60 lpcd in BNA cities and 45 lpcd in IKK towns to about 60% of the 1985
population within project area. The areas to be served are those where
service can be extended in the most cost-effective manner, usually the more
densely populated town centers. Higher priority is given to areas which
have poor present water service, poor sanitation, or adverse health
experiences. Service is not provided where local people and officials have
expressed unwillingness to receive service. Standpipe service is provided
to persons near springs (particularly if the spring has been the traditional
source) and along transmission lines, even if such persons live outside the
project area. Hence subprojects generally serve more than 60% of the target
population.
D. Water Quality
WHO highest desirable level, but consideration given to Indonesian
standards; chlorine dosing capacity: 3 mg of free chlorine per liter;



- 5-                                   ANNEX 4
Page 2
average chlorine dosing 1.5 mg of free chlorine per liter; not less than two
chlorinators per system.
E. Water Service Levels
The water supply service levels and allocation of water for
domestic consumers is shown in the following table:

/a  Represents about 60% of the community's total population.
Under BNA standards, the water allocation for institutions will be per DSE
standard allowances by category of institution or 25% of domestic demand,
whichever is lower. Losses are allowed for at least 15%' of total consumption
maximum day flow is 1.15 times average day, lumpy investments (such as
transmission mains) are sized at 1.43 times the 1985 maximum day demand, and
there is no allocation for fire flow. Under IKK standards non-domestic
consumption is allocated at 5% of the domestic allocation, losses are 15% of
total consumption, maximum day is 1.1 times average day, and there is no
maximum hour or fire flow allocation.
II. BNA Design Criteria and Checklist

H. Control Systems and Instrumentation /2
(i) For pumps, manual if not more than two pumps in close proximity;
instrumentation to indicate flow rate and quantity, and water level and
pressure. Audible alarms for overflows. For remote sources, control by
float operated valve in storage reservoir and pressure activated switch on
transmission line.
(ii) Pumps protected by low water level cutouts and relux valve micro
switches to indicate flow failure. Instantaneous flow rate and totalizer
flow meters to be located at well head and storage tank outlets.
(iii) At startup of facilities operating procedures will be developed to
optimize the time of pumping, to enable maximum use of off-peak power rates.
I. Buildings
Office buildings sized at 6 sq m per office worker will be provided
under the Project if space is not presently available. Each subproject will
be provided with a standard workshop of 84 sq m, and a major workshop will
be built for each PDAM headquarters. Generators and chlorinators will be
housed in buildings dedicated to such purposes. Guard houses will be
provided where security needs dictate.
III. IKK Design Criteria and Checklist
A. IKK Standard Systems
The IKK subprojects are a part of Government's effort to rapidly
build water supply systems in numerous kecamaten headquarter towns, to which
end DSE has prepared standardized modules to simplify design, procurement,
/_ Subject to review by DSE to determine if 15 or 20 mm is more cost
effective.

Project; Sir M. MacDonald and Partners, August 1982; Section 5.14 (Docu-
ment B.1 in Project File).

D. Standard Designs and Specifications
DSE has standard designs for IKK wells, well heads, service
connectors and standpipes.  Standard civil works and equipment specifications
for IKK subprojects are the same as for BNA subprojects. The more unique
feature of the design is that, in order to reduce capital and operating
costs, one day's household supply is provided over 24 hours, i.e., there is
no ability to meet instantaneous and peak demands. This lowers pipe costs
andl eliminates meters, meter reading and volume-based billing.
E. Storage Reservoirs
No storage is provided in IKK systems. Hlowever, each household
provides a traditional in-house tank of about 1 cu m capacity.
F. Buildings
Office buildings and workshop space will not be provided.
IV. Review of BNA and IKK
A review would be conducted of present BNA and IKK design
criteria. The review would cover the theoretical aspects of design and also
the experiences of actual installations, with regard to practicality,
economy and consumer acceptance. The review would address questions such
as:
(a) Is the 60% target service level appropriate and economic?
(b) Can the high speed design methods developed by DSE be
improved to produce more efficient designs?



- 58 -                             ANNEX 4
Page 6
(c) Is the time horizon for design capacity adequate? What about for
lumpy investments?
(d)  Do consumers accept low flow systems which require in-house
storage? Should the systems be designed to accomodate
extensive conversions from low flow connections to metered
connections which could meet peak demands?
(e) What is an appropriate water allocation for commercial and
industrial connections in BNA and IKK systems?
(f) Should IKK systems have service storage? (At present there is
no provision for such storage).
(g)  Does the source selection procedure of DSE ensure that the
least cost water source is chosen?
(h) Are the mechanisms for testing if the community wants and needs
the proposed wate- system appropriate, and if not, how can they be
improved? How can there be more advanced consu:Ltation with
the communities?
(i) What is the "bad debt" experience from house connections and
standpipes?
(j) Is the lumpiness of IKK connection numbers (i.e., in lumps
of 180, 360 or 720 connections) appropriate and efficient?
Are limits on numbers of connections appropriate, or should the
numbers be determined by actual count of prospective consumers done
in consultation with local officials?
(k) To what extent should systems be designed with standby facilities
to enhance reliability?
(1) Consideration is being given to providing partial day service in
the initial years of operation (to reduce operating costs,
especially where electric generators are required for pumping).
What are the implications of this, considering: (i) the distri-
bution systems restricted connections are designed for average
flow rates, i.e., a uniform flow over a 24 hour period; (ii)
possible contamination of water in distribution system; (iii)
potential capital and operating cost saving; and (iv) possible
design changes, and changes in operating procedures.
(m)  Should IKK systems invariably have two wells each, (one as standby)
even if not required to meet water demand?

(in) Should IKK systems unvariably have two wells each (one as
standby), even if not required to meet water demand?
(n) House connections are designed for 10 persons per connection,
yet census data shows the on average only 5 persons live in a
household. CK explains that it uses 10 persons on the assumption
that two houses will draw water from each connection. What are
the design and cost implications of this practice? Should it be
changed?

EAST JAVA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Project Implementation and Supervision
A. Implementation Program
1.        Project implementation is divided into the following ten main areas
of activity which would be carried out as shown in Chart 5.
(a) Engineering services for the ENA City and IKK town subprojects,
'covering studies, surveys and design;
(b) Engineering services for project management and construction
supervision;
(c) Land acquisition;
(d) Bulk procurement of pipes, well screens and casings, and related
equipment;
(e) Bulk procurement of electrical and mechanical (E and M) equipment
and supplies;
(f) Civil works, covering the contracts for all general construction
and pipelaying;
(g) Well construction, covering completion of all deep wells;
(h) Other equipment such as drill rigs and training materials,
purchased separately and not under bulk procurement;
(i) Other technical assistance and studies; and
(j) Training.
2.        Engineering Design Services for the BNA and IKK Subprojects.  The
preliminary design studies for the 13 cities were completed by October 1982
and the final designs would be finished by May 1983. Final design and
cost estimates for the IKK subprojects of those towns which do not depend on
groundwater drilling are complete. Final design for the towns where
groundwater drilling is required will have to await completion of drilling,
scheduled for February 1983.
3.        Advisory Services for Project. Management and Construction
Supervision.  These services provide project management expertise to the



ANNEX 6
-- 64 -                             Page 2
Project Management and Project Implementation Units, covering procurement,
contracting, liason, critical path analysis, construction supervision and
start-up. The functions of the PMU and PIU are described in the Project
File, which also contains TOR for the advisory services. About four foreign
and numerous local engineers and technicians would be required. The work
would begin about May 1983 with two people, and the staff would gradually
be built up to full complement by 1984. In addition, several Indonesian
consulting firms would assist in the field supervision of construction and
in plant inspections of goods during manufacture as necessary. Consulting
firms to be employed have been designated.
4.         Other Technical Assistance and Studies.  The Project includes
technical assistance to help develop PDAM organizations and to continue the
support for DSE begun under earlier water supply and urban development
loans. Studies are in the area of finance, tariffs, institutional
arrangements, design criteria and the preparation of future projects.
Technical assistance to PDAMs and studies would be phased over the period
1984-87, starting with existing PDAMs and progressing to those formed in the
later stages of the Project. Annex 3 describes technical assistance and
studies in greater detail.
5.         Training.  Training is in the areas of PDAM management and
operations, and includes administrative and manual skills. Training will
take place over the period June 1984-December 1987. Annex 2 describes the
program.
6.         Land.  Land acquisition must also be completed quickly, to allow
the final site investigations to be done and to confirm land availability
for the final designs. Land requirements have been defined by the
consultants and land acquisition has been initiated by DSE, the East Java
government and the beneficiary kabupatens.
7.         Bulk Procurement.  The bulk procurement documents will allow for
the provision of the equipment quantities envisaged at preliminary design
stage with options to adjust the quantities by moderate amounts. Bulk
procurement contracts will cover:
(a)  Pipeline equipment and supplies;
(b)  Well screens and casings;
(c)  Water meters for production facilities;
(d)  Pumps, motors and controllers, including associated pipework,
valves;
(e)  Generator sets and electrical appurtenances; and
(f)  Chlorination equipment.



ANNEX 6
5-                                 Page 3
8.        Pipeline Equipment and Supplies.  Pipeline equipment and supplies
include procurement of all transmission and distribution pipework and
valves, all pipework and valves for service connections, flowmeters,
restrictors and similar items. This heading also covers all special tools
and equipment needed for installation and testing of the above items.
9.        The procurement of pipes is normally the critical path item
because a period of 11 months must be allowed for bidding, evaluation and
award, and another 7 months for the initial delivery of goods (4 months for
fabrication and 3 months for shipping and customs clearance). The draft
tender documents have been prepared and approved by the Bank and the call
for bids has been issued. In order to expedite the project CK will draw
on existing stocks of pipe and accessories (and well casings and screens,
see para. 1) until equivalent goods, procured under the project, are
delivered. Stocks so drawn will be then also be replaced. CK has assured
that goods in stock which will be used for the project fully meet the tech-
nical specifications approved by the Bank.
10.       Electrical-Mechanical Equipment and Supplies.  The timing for
these items is similar to that for the pipeline equipment and supplies:
award of contracts in January 1984. However most of the electrical and
mechanical equipment is not needed at such an early stage in the Projects
construction and delivery can be programed to match the requirements of the
other contracts. The first main requirement will be for the well pumps and
equipment, forwarding pumps, control equipment and other items, for the
first IKK subprojects towns in December 1984.
11.       Well Screens and Casings.  Twenty six IKK subprojects will be
supplied by wells. Of these 17 wells are already in place; they were
originally drilled under the exploration program and will be converted to
production wells. The same is true for eight of the 24 wells required for
the nine BNA towns which will be served by wells. As described in para. 9,
well casings and screens required prior to the delivery of project -
procured goods would be drawn from existing stocks and subsequently
replaced.
12.       Civil Works.  Preparation of tender documents is proceeding
simultaneously with the final design work. Indonesian standard documents
will be used. For the 13 BNA subprojects, the documents should be
completed by end of March 1983, while the IKK documents should be completed
two months later.
13.       The first batch of civil works contracts would be bid in the last
half of 1983. Bidding periods are scheduled to take two months, followed by
two month periods for the evaluation of bid, approval of the recommendations
and award of tender.



ANNEX 6

14.        Civil works contracts would be phased to spread out the work of
evaluating and awarding the large numbers of contracts involved. Con-
tractors for the first batch of towns (Batch A) would start construction
in 1984; Batches B and C follow in two month intervals. Provisional
allocation of the batches has been based on achieving a balance of BNA and
IKK subprojects. Batch A covers Madiun, Sampang and Tulungagung; Batch B,
Malang and Tuban; Batch C, Situbondo, Mohokerto and Sidoarjo.
15.        The allocation of service connections to individual consumers
should be decided by the PDAM staff not later than March 1984 so contractors
can make connections while laying mains. All connections under the Project
should be completed by the end of 1987.
16.       Well Construction.  The program for well construction (other than
that already done under the exploration program, see para. 11) follows a
similar pattern to that for the civil works: documents prepared by December
1983 and work on site starting in July 1984. This program would allow bulk
procured well-screen and casing to be used in the wells with delivery of
these supplies in April 1984.
17.        Other Equipment.  This covers equipment which is not purchased
under the bulk procurement procedures. The principal items are: vehicles,/l
office equipment and furniture, and possibly laboratory and workshop
equipment.
B. Contract Arrangements
18.        Contracts are divided into five types:
(a)  civil works construction for the BNA  -.&bprojects;
(b)  civil works construction for the IKK subprojects;
(c)  civil work construction for any PDAM Head Office in a town
where there is no new waterworks system;
(d)  groundwater development, to provide deep drilled wells;
(e)  procurement of equipment and supplies for all the subprojects.
19.        Civil Works Construction.  Civil works contracts are small and
widely scattered in area and time span. They would be carried out following
local competitive bidding procedures. They would be grouped (where feasible
/1 Because GOI does not allow importation of vehicles, all motor vehicles
and cycles would be procured locally following GOI procedures, and
Bank loan would not disburse against them.

in packages which would exceed US$320,000 in value) to encourage the
participation of large local contractors or joint ventures of small local
firms. A tentative listing of contracts is given in Attachment 1 to this
Annex.
20.       For the BNA systems, two packages have been adopted:  one would
cover all general construction work for the source works, transmission main,
service reservoir, offices and other buildings; the other would cover all
the pipelaying for the distribution system, including installation of the
service connections. The general value of each contract package is expected
to lie in the range of Rp 100 million to 1,000 million, at December 1982
price levels.
21.       For the IKK subprojects, the value of the construction work in an
individual town will be quite small. Thus a single contract would be
sufficient for each town; in fact, it may be found that several IKK schemes
which are sited close together could be combined into a single contract.
On the assumption of an individual contract for each town, the average
value is likely to range between Rp 25 million to 100 million.
22.       The [lead Offices for four of the Kabupaten PDAMs will be located
in towns where water supply schemes will be under construction for the
Project. In these cases, construction of the Head Office should be
included in the general construction contract for the town.  lowever, for
the other three Kabupatens, the Head Office will be a town where no other
construction work is in progress for the Project. In these cases the use
of existing Government or other office space would be considered, but
separate contracts have been tentatively listed and included in the Project.
23.       The BNA subprojects will need about 16 additional deep wells (plus
conversion work for the eight existing exploratory holes); the work has been
split into two contracts. The number of wells to be drilled for the IKK
subprojects depends on the results of the ongoing investigations contract
and on the policy adopted for the number of wells per town. On the
assumption that 26 wells are required, a set of three drilling contracts is
proposed. Thus the value of the groundwater drilling contracts are expected
to lie in the range of Rp 80 million to 100 million; in all cases of work
will cover construction of the well alon,e, without pumping equipment and
pipework.
24.       Procurement of Equipment and Supplies.  Procurement of equipment
and supplies would be done in nine packages covering: pipes and fittings
(2 packages), borehole screen and casing, water meters, electrical/
mechanical equipment, chlorination equipment, vehicles, drill rigs and
miscellaneous items. 'lost of these items would be obtained under the normal
ICB procedures; some of the packages, such as for miscellaneous equipment,
may be covered by other procurement arrangements and vehicles would be
procured under GOI procedures. All procurement contracts will be adminis-
tered centrally, from the DSE and Cipta Karya offices in Jakarta.



ANNEX 6
- 68 -                             Page 6
25.       Bulk procured items would be delivered to the headquarters town of
each of the Kabupatens. This will avoid the need for a very large stores
compound in Surabaya and some double-handling and transport costs.
C. Project Management
26.       Project Implementation and Project Management Units would be
established comprising of two central units, located in Surabaya, and eight
subunits. Each subunit would supervise all construction work within one
kabupaten. The largest subunit (for Malang Kabupaten) would be responsible
for four BNA schemes and nine IKK schemes; the smallest number of schemes
under one subunit would be the single subproject for Kotamadya Madiun.
Specialist advisers would be located in the PIU and PMU. The functions of
the PIU and PMU are described in item B.2.4 of the Project File.
27. The Units to be established in Surabaya will be responsible for:
(a) overseeing work of consultants during preparation of final
designs and contract documents;
(b) liaison with all local government offices, at provincial,
kabupaten and kecamatan levels;
(c) liaison with the central offices in Jakarta of DSE, Cipta Karya
and other agencies;
(d)  approval of all contract documents for construction, issuing
of documents, appraisal of tenders and award of contracts;
(e) supervision of construction for all these contracts, through the
PIU subunits in the kabupatens;
(f) maintaining records and project accounts;
(g) receiving and dealing with design queries and changes initiated
by the subunits;
(h) coordinating the procedures for procurement, delivery and storage
of equipment and supplies (the actual contracts will be adminis-
tered centrally).
(i) assisting in start-up of facilities; and
(j)  assisting in training of construction supervisory staff and PDAM
operating personnel.
28.       The staff in each subunit would be responsible for administering
all the construction contracts within their kabupaten. Assisted by
consultants, they would undertake all the normal site supervision duties,
would check contractor's statements for payments, review contractual

problems as they arise and initiate queries, improvements or changes
required for the detailed designs.
29.       The PMU, PIU and subunits would be staffed by integrated teams
drawn from DSE/Cipta Karya offices and from consultants.

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FI]NANCIAL PROJECTIONS /1
Existing Financial Statements
1.        Other than Madium, the six PDAMs which have water supply systems
have precarious operations, low percentage of population served, water
rationing, and staff which have not the experience or training required for
public utilities. These deficiencies are a common factor for the project
PDAMs (see para. 6.02).  Accounting is rudimentary and the financial results
for 1981 were not available when the feasibility report was prepared.
Furthermore there is no accounting information previous to the establishment
of these PDAMs in 1981. Financial data for 1981 and estimates for 1982 were
then prepared by the consultants during the feasibility studies. The
financial information information available is therefore limited and not
fully reliable. Financial projections for the period 1981-90 were prepared
by consultants as a part of the feasibiliLty study, and revised by Bank staff.
The deficiencies of the feasibility reports and financial data are noted
in the Project File and have been discussed with CK. These projections will
be revised in detail during the preparation of the tariff studies.
Revised financial projections
2.        Financial projections are shown in Annex 10.  Consultants esti-
mates for 1982-83 were maintained where appropriate.  The main modifica-
tions made by Bank staff and the financial assumptions are described below.
3.        Demand.  In the feasibility reports practically all connections
and population benefitted is assumed served by 1986. Given the project
construction schedule, some of the IKKS would be completed in early 1985.
Therefore the revised projections include some connections and volume sold
in this year. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the forecasted large
increase in connection and population served would be achieved by 1987,
especially since in some IKKs the capacity being provided would serve more
than 90% of the population, and its is difficult to reach these levels of
service during project construction. In the appaisal projections the
population and connections targets are reached only by 1988, although it
takes up to 1990 for IKKs where the capacity has been provided to serve up
to 90% or more of the forecasted population.
4.        Population.  No separate analysis of demand by towns or IKKs was
presented in the report. Detail anlaysis of population and levels of
services was made during the appraisal for the cities and IKKs included in
the project and those others, served or not, under the PDAM-s jurisdiction
(see Annex 9, typical Demand Analysis). The reasons above explain why the
annual targets for population, connection, volume sold etc. are different
between the appraisal and feasibility reports. The overall capacity is the
same. Population forecast are based in the 1980 census and actual surveys
by consultants. The population with water include all users and the popula-
tion served refers to house connection service.

5.        Water production.  Unaccounted-for-water was reported at very low
levels (below 3%) in some PDAMs. Since this is not feasible the volume sold
was adjusted to reflect at least 15-20% unaccounted-for-water. After the
project completion, the design target of 15% unaccounted-for-water was
maintained (but increased for PDAMs were the old system is a significant
part), since the water systems are going to be practically new. In Madium a
leak detection study combined with the new systems built, is expected to
reduce the unaccounted-for-water to 17% by 1983. These assumptions are
optimistic but consistent with the design parameters.
6.        Financing.  The feasibility report assumed that half of the project
works would be financed by soft-terms loan. Financial projections prepared
during the appraisal (available in Project File), show that debt financing
is affordable if soft term conditions are provided. The government s present
policies of grant financing have been accepted by the Bank, pending the
result of financial and tariff studies convenanted under the Project (para.
6.06). The appraisal projections are based on grant financing and levels of
tariffs and other revenues (house connections) which would cover all operat-
ing expenses and the revalued depreciation of fixed assets in operation i.e.
0% rate of return, starting in 1985.
7.        Other operating revenues.  Other operating revenues include
meter-maintenance charges, charges for late payment etc. However, the main
source are connection charges. Since the respective installation cost is
financed with the other capital expenditures, and the connection belong to
the PDAM, these charges are considered an alternative to tariffs which would
recover the capital expenditures. This also allows all revenues to be
controlled by the revenue covenant. The feasibility report assumes that the
average charges for residential consumers and industrial connections will be
about Rp 70,000 and Rp 90,000 respectively (in 1982 prices). That report
also assumes that residential consumers will be allowed to pay these charges
in installments during a five year period (free of interest), and that others
users will be allowed to pay during two years. These assumptions have been
maintained, but the charges for house connections were reduced to Rp 40,000,
which is considered the average cost of connections in cities and IKKs, and
would be affordable to the population. Assurances were obtained that resi-
dential consumers will be allowed to pay the house connection cost over
three to five years. The annual values used for the financial statements
(Annex 10), represent the expected annual collection from these revenues.
8.        Depreciation is based on the replacement value of existing and
operating assets, plus the value of new assets in operation incorporated
during project construction. The depreciation rates for each type of asset
and the corresponding compound rate are shown in Annex 5 Table 1, page 2.
Depreciation rates of 2.86 to 3.65% were used for the new assets and slightly
less for the overall PDAM, (because of totally depreciated assets among the
old fixed assets).  In the past the transfer of assets from CK to the PDAMs
have been a slow process. Under the Project these assets should be transfer
shortly after their commissioning.

0perairng expenses
9.         Personnel.  Personnel expenses are based in detail analysis for
the number of employees required to operate each PDAM.  The integration of
serfa. citIsi and towns in a water enterprises results in economics of
sCale. The number of employees requixed to serve one thousand connections,
which be.tween 15 to 33 in the existing systems, is expected to be reduced to
about 10 by 1987 (compared with 3 in USA and about 7 in Latin America).
This increase in efficiency does not require reduction in present staff but
a better use of the additional staff needed after the project completion.
Some: I-ey persons (engineers, managers. etc) may require to be hired, and
traiLne e ven before the new connections will generate additional revenues.
This requires subsidies for operation (show as operational grants) for the
sta -t-up period of some PDAMis.
110        Chemicals and Power.  These expenses have been projected using
uncn CEostS ir constant prices per cubic meter produced.  These and other
unci prices are not fully reliable (details available in Project File) and
ave-age coefficients per cu m were used in some PDAMs (mainly Sidoarjo and
Sitabondo'. The unch:Lorinated water provided now would be chlorinated after
the new systems enter into operation.
i11        Ooher expenses.  Expenses in materials, maintenance, transporta-
tionC and general expenses were projected in relation to the number of
cornections, but allowing for economics cf scale and inflation. Since the
systei  would be new the expenses in materials and maintenance are expected
to iDe lower than for the old systems.  Values forecasted in the feasibility
reports were used until 1983.  In some PEMLs the forecasted expenses were
considered excessive and the coefficient per cubic meter produced adjusted
wit-hin. the range of the mission analysis of 60 BPAMs in Indonesian which are
presently In operation (available in Project File). This raises or lowers
some of the expenses between 1983 and 1984.
12.        Bad debts.  Bad debts are compvted (Annex 13) based in a percentage
of uncolleotable bills of 2% for residential users below 10 cu m, 1% for
other residential users, 5% for social consumers, 0.3% for large users, 17
for the iovernment and 15% for standpipes.  The bad debts allowance varies
bet:7i en 2524 and 3.12 for the different IPAMs, and if higher during the
13,        inflation.  The estimated rates of inflation for local costs are
13%  for 1933.l10% for 1984 and 7% thereafter.  The estimated foreign infla-
i i< n i5s 8%o in 1983, 7.5% in 1984, 7%0 in 1985 and 6% thereafter.  The
axehange ra-te Is estimated at Rp 700 per dollar.

ii  was redu_ed from 15 to 10 cubic meters per month per connection.
(i.e  about 60 lerd for an average family of 5.2 persons).  This histogram



- 106 -                          ANNEX 11
Page 4
is very conservative since no residential connections are assumed to use
more than 30 cu m per month, at which level the maximum tariff is applied
(three times the minimum tariff).
15.       Tariffs and affordability.  Revenues achievable based in this
consumption histogram, are shown in Annex 13. The average ratio between the
average and minimum tariff is 1.58, which is used to estimate the tariff for
minimum consumption (Annex 14). The progressivety for excess consumption
can be increased, in which case these ratio would become 2 or more. This
tariff progressivety allows the subsidization of urban poor, while maintain-
ing overall satisfactory tariffs. The tariff for minimum consumption is
assumed to be increased to 50 Rp cu m in June 1983. The full effect of this
increase is reflected in 1984. In 1985 and thereafter tariffs are assumed
sufficient to cover operation, maintenance and depreciation on revalued
assets. Althoug this has been proposed by Cipta Karya, it may not be fully
achievable in 1985, since the increase in the number of consumers and water
sold would be small in relation to the new assets entering into operation.
16.       Income distribution.  The income distribution was estimated by
consultants based in socio-economic surveys for cities and IKKs. Although
the results show some differences which are difficult to explain (i.e.
higher income in the IKKs than in the cities), these data is indicative of
levels of income (Annex 14). The relative poverty level, based in 1/3 of
the per capita income, shows that between 40 to 76% (average 60%) of the
population is in relative poverty.
17.       Affordability.  Expenditures for water services between 3 and 7%
of the household income are normally considered affordable. A level of 4%
of the income was used for the analysis of affordability. The results show
that minimum tariffs for house connection service of 40 Rp/cu m in 1983
prices are affordable to practically all, 88 Rp per cu m are affordable to
88% of the population and of 132 Rp/cu m are affordable to 76% of the
population.  The average tariffs which are affordable to 88% of the popula-
tion are 139 Rp/cu m (Annex 14). The percentage of monthly income required
for house connection and standpipe service is below 2% of the minimum family
income (para. 6.07).
18.       Balance statements.  Cash.  Minimum cash is about one month of
personnel expenses. Since there is no debt service, nor identifiable works
other than the project, the excess cash is allowed to acc-umulate. This cash
should only be used to increase, repair and expand the systems. Accounts
receivable are projected (net of bad debts) at about two months of billing.
Inventories are projected on the basis of annual expenditures in materials
and chemicals. Accounts payable are projected as 60 days of expenses (mainly
for power).
19.       Additional information.  Full financial projections, including
detailed tables on demand, project cost, financial assumptions, financial
statements, marginal cost and internal rate of return analysis are avail-
able in Project File for each PDAM. Monitoring indicators are presented in
Annex 12.

EAST JAVA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Governor's Instructions - Summary of Contents
The instructions issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs to the
uovernor of East Java, on February 12, 1983, which were passed in turn to
the beneficiary kabupatens/kotamadya, contain directi-es concerning:
(a) Management of PDAMs and the receipt of projec: assets by the PDAM
upon project completion.
(b)  Establishment of PDAMs by June 1983.
(c) The opening of subbranches in IKK towns.
(d) The employment of central government personnel to rrepare local
personnel for the tasks of managing PDAMs and participating in
construction.
(e) Water tariffs in conformity with national guidelines.
(f) PDAM actions to activate the supervisory board, increase the
numbers of house connections and manage an appropriate financial
system.
(g) Investment of capital in the PDAM by the Level II (local)
government.
(h) Funding of land acquisition by the Level II government.
(i) The conservation of water sources.
(j) Assignment of Level II government personnel to the project.
The instructions have attached a brief description of each subproject. The
instructions are in the Project File, Item B.2.

Rate of Return
1.        Economic rates of return (ERR) have been calculated for the overaUl
PDAM, including all BNA cities and IKKs under their respective jurisdiction,s
This analysis is considered appropriate since the per capita investment cos
and the standards of service are similar, the administration and management
will be shared, the investment will start and reach its design horizon
within the same period, and the tariff will be uniform for all cities in the
same PDAM. However, the overall analysis is a rough estimate since only
preliminary feasibility reports are available, and some cities or IKKs halr-e
design horizons longer than the average, making difficult the estimation o-
the year when the overall capacity of the project will be reached.
2.        The rates of return have been calculated using the charges pai;
currently to water vendors for small quantities of consumption (15 lpcd) and
the covenanted tariff levels for the higher consumption as a proxy for
economic benefits. The analysis includes some complementary investmen-s
(additional pumps) required to fully utilize the project's capacity in some
cities. This, for on the IKKs which have a capacity to serve more tha.1
80-90% of their population (which are expected to be served only by 1ij90),
explains the increase in connections between 1988 and 1990. Following
present policies of the Government the revenue covenant requires tariffs and
other revenues to cover operation and depreciation starting in 1985=
Because this results in a relatively low tariff, and because of the long
period forecasted to build the project and reach the connection target
(1983-88), the ERRs are low, averaging +4% (Table 1). The ERR indicates the
economic justification for higher tariffs. Such tariffs are likely to
result from the proposed study on tariffs and cost recovery (paras. 1.21 and
6.06), and would provide a more meaningful ERR. Nevertheless, lower tariffs
are considered adequate at the begirLning in order to promote the acceptancea
of safe, publicly supplied water.

3.        The ERR using tariffs as a proxy for consumer willingness to pay
measures only a part of the project benefits. This is especially relevant
to this project, since the water services are going to be heavily curtailed,
allowing the use of minimum amounts of water (half of the beneficiaries will
be served by standpipes, IKKs connections will have flow restriction devices,
and water pressure will limit the volume usable by other connections). The
willingness to pay for low volumes of water is shown by the price paid to
water vendors. This price is about Rp 250 per cu m (for about 1.2 per cu m
per family, purchased in 20 liter cans), but reaches Rp 1,000 per cu m in
Sidoarjo and Rp 2,000 per cu m in Panarukan. The willingness to pay for the
first 15 lpcd is estimated at Rp 250 per cu m /1 and for the remaining
consumption at the average tariff in each PDAM. To ensure that the PDAMs
are properly managed and to retain the staff to be trained the feasibility
study recommends a new salary structure which will increase the personnel
expense for new and previous employees. Both the benefits of the improve
service for existing consumers (continuous service, better water quality,
higher pressure) and the revised cost for the existing staff are not inclu-
ded in the economic analysis. A typical analysis is shown for Mojokerto,
Table 1. The analysis of the other PDAMs is in the Project File and is
summarized in Table 2.
/1 This is about 4 cu m for the total connections including standpipes.

6.        These rates of return underestimate the economic benefits, because
they do not capture externalities which accrue to the community, such as
improved health and reduced morbidity and mortality. Furthermore the water
purchased from water vendors is not purified and lacks the convenience of
piped water; therefore its price does not fully express the consumer's
willingness to pay. In any case justification of this project does not rest
upon these rates of return, but that at a minimum cost provides essential
and safe water supply to a heretofore unserved population (more than half of
whom are poor) and strengthens sector institutions and polices.
