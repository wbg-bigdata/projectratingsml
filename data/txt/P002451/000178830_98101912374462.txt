MOGADISHU WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOR
Background
2
1.01      Somalia, with a land area of 637,700 km , is situated in the most
easterly corner of the African continent, bordered on the north by the Gulf
of Aden and the Arabian Peninsula, on the east by the Indian Ocean, and on
the west and southwest by Ethiopia and Kenya. Although the northern and
parts of the eastern area are mountainous, most of the country consists of
plateau sloping easterly from the Ethiopian Highland to the Indian Ocean
with a broad coastal plain to the south.
1.02      The climate is arid in the north and central portions to semi-arid
in the south in the inter-riverine area, with rainfall ranging from 50 mm
to 600 mm annually. Annual precipitation is irregular and risk of drought
ever-present. The principal rainfall season is from April to June with a
minor season occurring from October to December. About 80% of the popula-
tion depend upon agriculture and animal husbandry and more than half of
Somalia's land is suitable for livestock production.
Water Resources
1.03      Water resources in Somalia are unevenly distributed and scanty.
There are only two perennial rivers, the Giuba and the Shebelli, which origi-
nate outside Somalia and traverse the southern part of the country. Although
generally limited both as to quantity and quality, ground water is Somalia's
principal source of water supply. In the Giuba and Shebelli river basins,
ground water can be used in conjunction with surface water supplies. Good
records of surface water exist although records of ground water resources are
deficient.
Population
1.04      The population of Somalia was estimated at 3.3 million in 1975 and
to be increasing at a rate of 2.4% per year. Urban population was estimated
at 1.0 million and has been growing at about 4.4% annually, whereas the rural
population has been growing at a rate of about 1.3% per year. Mogadishu,
with an estimated 445,000 inhabitants, or 40% of the urban population, is the
country's capital and largest city and is growing at about 6% per year whereas
the balance of the urban area has an annual growth estimated at about 3.6%
per year.
Population Served
1.05      Based on information collected during a water supply and sewerage
sector study made in 1976 under the WHO/IBRD Cooperative Program, 20% of the



- 2-
rural population and about 60% of the urban population had reasonable access
to water supply service in 1975.  The percentage of Somalia's urban population
provided with water service is significantly affected by the relatively large
proportion (about 87% in 1975) of Mogadishu's population served from the
public water supply.
1.06      Public sewerage exists only in Mogadishu where service is restricted
to hotels, offices and a relatively small residental population (about 3000)
located in the central portion of the City.  The system is old and a project
to extend this system and also provide storm water drainage recently was ap-
praised by the African Development Fund (AfDF). The remaining urban popula-
tion is served by individual disposal systems.
Public Health
1.07      There are few reliable statistics on specific water-borne and sani-
tation-associated diseases although morbidity and mortality due to common
enteric and parasitic diseases are known to be exceptionally high through-
out the country. Tuberculosis, malaria, various diarrheas, dysenteries and
parasitic infections directly attributable to environmental deficiencies, are
the more commonly observed of the important communicable diseases.  Among
infants and children, gastroenteritis is the most common communicable disease,
a recent study revealing that 40% of the children examined were suffering
from the disease. Rural areas, small urban centers and fringe areas of the
largest cities are particularly subject to these diseases due to the lack of
communication, convenient medical facilities and basic sanitary measures of
safe water and sanitation.
Organization
1.08      Although several different agencies are involved, no agency is
in charge of overall planning and programming of community water supplies
and waste disposal in the country. At the central Government level, three
organizations, viz., the Ministry of Minerals and Water Resources (MMWR),
the Ministry of Health (MOH), and the Water Resources Development Committee
(WRDC) mainly are involved in the sector. A recently formed Ministry of
Municipal Affairs and Rural Development may also become indirectly active in
the sector although presently there is no information indicating the extent of
these future activities. Local government agencies are responsible for both
water supply and sanitation but, except for a rudimentary wastewater system in
Mogadishu (see para. 1.06), currently only water supply is provided. Autono-
mous water agencies exist in three major cities, viz., Mogadishu, Hargeisa and
Chisimaio.
1.09      Responsibilities of MMWR are carried out by the Water Development
Agency (WDA) and the Mogadishu Water Agency (see paras. 2.02 and 2.18), which
are the principal organizations in the sector. WDA provides technical



- 3 -
assistance to both rural and urban communities through seven regional offices
and a headquarters office located in Mogadishu. Although WDA has many re-
sponsibilities, due to staff constraints, it is effective in only a few. Its
activities have been confined largely to the construction of tube wells for
domestic and livestock use, provision of public standposts and impoundments
for small urban communities and rural villages, and watering points for the
nomadic population.  It also constructs tube wells under contract to private
and quasi-governmental organizations. Due mainly to the lack of qualified
engineering personnel, WDA does not design or construct piped water supply
systems. The little work of this type so far attempted has been contracted to
foreign consultants financed through bilateral assistance. A program of this
type financed by the Federal Republic of Germany recently was begun for ten
small towns throughout the country.
1.10      WDA is headed by a General Manager appointed by the President on
the recommendation of the Minister of Minerals and Water Resources. Four
major departments exist, viz., Drilling, Engineering, Administration and
Hydrogeology, although many authorized posts are vacant. 1/ WDA is partially
funded through Government budgets and partially through revenue-producing
activities. It is empowered to recover project costs from municipalities,
may borrow funds for its operations from Government and from external sources
with prior approval of MMWR, and may contract its services to cooperatives or
clients outside of Government channels.
1.11      MOH's responsibility in the sector has been limited mainly to exer-
cising control and surveillance over water quality and guiding local communi-
ties in environmental sanitation. Through the basic Health Service projects,
MOH is attempting to improve water supply and sanitation in rural areas.
These pilot projects have been effective although, due to limited finance and
constraints in material and human resources, effectiveness of MOH in other
areas has been minimal.
1.12      WRDC is a national advisory group consisting of representatives
of the ministries of Interior, Mineral and Water Resources, Livestock and
Director General of Planning and Coordination. The Committee is instrumental
in helping to shape sector policies and functions as a coordinating body with
respect to all water resource projects. It advises the sector agencies,
principally WDA and local governments, in the selection of projects and in
budget preparation.
1.13      Other Ministries also are active in the sector.  The Ministry of
Agriculture implements projects which involve the construction of tube wells
and dug wells, the Ministry of Livestock provides watering points in rural
1/   In 1976 approximately half of the established posts were vacant with
none of the posts in the Hydrogeological Department and only 40% of
the posts in the Engineering Department being filled. A particular
deficiency exists in the Drilling Department due to the shortage of
experienced drilling superintendents.

areas for nomads, and the Ministry of Defense constructs wells for military
reservations. None of these organizations has the capability of independently
planning and implementing water supply projects and must depend upon WDA, ex-
patriate advisors, or consultants for such expertise, generally on a project
by project basis. The various agencies operate more or less in isolation thus
fragmenting sector development efforts.
Sector Objectives
1.14       Government's development objectives for the sector are expressed
in general terms, and are not supported by plans for attaining those objec-
tives. Government's objectives are to provide: (i) adequate, reliable and
saEe water for domestic use and water for livestock, industry and agriculture
at modest prices throughout the country; and (ii) future water facilities
within reasonable access of all potential users.
Sector Development
1.15       Little sector development has occurred to date.  In the early 1970s
external assistance from the United States Agency for International Develop-
ment (USAID) provided technical assistance and finance for water system
extensions in the cities of Chisimaio and Mogadishu. Additional aid was
provided in the mid-1970s by the People's Republic of China through finance
of extensions to the Hargeisa water system. Other more recent assistance was
provided to WDA and has consisted of the furnishing of expatriate advisors
by the United Nations Development Programme and the financing of specialty
equjipment by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The latter assistance
recently was terminated.
1.1L6      Ongoinig external assistance also is being provided to WDA by the
Federal Republic of Germany (Germany). The assistance consists of a 5 DM
miLlion (US$2.5 million) technical assistance grant and a 22.9 DM million
(US$11.5 million) capital assistance loan for the construction of water sys-
tems in ten townls (see para. 1.09).  The German Government is also consider-
ing additional technical assistance to strengthen WDA through training and
provision of expatriate advisors.
Sector Investment
1.17       The Five Year Development Program (FYDP) for 1974-78 allocated
So Sh. 139 million (US$22 million) for water supply out of a total planned
public investment program of So.Sh. 3,863 million (US$614 million).  Due
maiinly to the drought, but also affected by the international economic
crisis and the poor state of project preparation, neither total invest-
ment nor investment in the water supply sector achieved planned expenditure
levels. Actual total investment during the period 1974-76 in all sectors
reached 52% of the planned investment program while actual investment in
the water supply sector for the same period reached only 45% of the pro-
grammed amount. Only two agencies were involved in implementing water supply



5-
improvements included in the 1974-78 FYDP. These were MWA for Mogadishu and
WDA for the remaining urban projects, the rural projects, and for procurement
of equipment and for carrying out related research. The 1976 water supply
and sewerage sector study recommended that the balance of the 1974-78 Devel-
opment Program be reformulated in the light of recent developments and sug-
gests a revised sector investment program for the period 1976-83. The total
required investment 1/ approximates So.Sh. 534 million (US$84.8 million) with
most of this investment scheduled for the four years 1978-82. Based upon past
experience, this proposed level of investment is unlikely to be achieved due
to Government's limited absorptive capacity.
1.18      Despite the relatively large proportion of population currently
provided water service in Mogadishu (see para. 1.05), Government places a
high priority in the early expansion of the Mogadishu water system because
of Mogadishu's high rates of growth of population and water demand, its
importance as Somalia's center of government, and the current extent of
the City's water supply deficiencies. Proposed Bank Group participation is
intended primarily to assist with long-term institutional improvements within
the sector.
1.19      Initially, it was assumed that Mogadishu's existing well field could
be expanded to develop whatever additional supply capacity was required. How-
ever, in 1977 it became apparent that production from MWA's existing well field
could not be significantly increased and future increases in demand instead
must be met from as yet unidentified sources of supply. Comprehensive water
resource investigations are needed to identify suitable sources. Assuming
these investigations could begin shortly, a project including long-term water
supply improvements could not be appraised before 1979. Since Mogadishu faces
serious water shortages which cannot be relieved until a major addition in
supply capacity is completed, it was decided to split the project into two
separate projects. The first of these, the proposed Project (Phase I), is a
small-scale project to carry out water resource investigations and to increase
production from the existing well field. The subsequent water supply project,
designated Phase II, would provide a long-term solution through provision for
additional supply capacity located elsewhere. In order to speed up the time
of preparation of the Phase II project, the Bank's Project Preparation Facil-
ity (PPF) is being used to finance a portion of the water resource investiga-
tions.
Water Rate Policy
1.20      No national water tariff policy exists.  Tariffs are levied only
in urban areas where water rates vary by community.

II. THE BORROWER AND THE PROJECT IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
Introduction
2.01      The Borrower would be the Government of the Somalia Democratic
Republic (SDR) which would relend the major portion (about 99%) of the US$6
million IDA Credit to the Mogadishu Water Agency (MWA), on the terms stated
in para. 5.08. The remaining portion of the credit consisting of technical
assistance would benefit the water supply sector through the Water Develop-
ment Agency.
Mogadishu Water Agency
Formation
2.02      MWA was established in 1967 to provide public water supplies in
Mogadishu shortly before the signing of a loan agreement between MWA, Govern-
m(ent and USAID. In April 1970, together with Chisimaio Water and Electric
Utility, it was merged into the National Water Agency (NWA). In 1971, NWA
was replaced by the Water Development Agency (WDA) and MWA was reestablished
and became responsible for the operation of Mogadishu's water supply system.
In 1974, the Council of Ministers and the Supreme Revolutionary Council
officially approved the creation of MWA. Recently MWA was made an auton-
omous agency under the Ministry of Mineral and Water Resources (MMWR).
Responsibility
2.03      Previously MWA's General Manager reported to the Mayor of Mogadishu
but was given considerable freedom to conduct MWA's affairs, consulting the
Maiyor mainly on issues of a possible political nature. The General Manager is
expected to continue to enjoy similar freedom of action under the new arrange-
ments. MWA's annual budgets are approved by the Ministry of Finance and will
now be subject to the prior approval of MMWR. Up to now there has been no
effective monitoring of MWA's budgets against performance, but major capital
expenditure projects are approved by the State Planning Commission.
Staffing and Recruitment
2.04      Appointments to the position of General Manager and other senior
positions will be made by the President following the recommendations of
the Minister of. Minerals and Water Resources. Prior to this, MWA's General
Manager will submit his recommendations for senior appointments to the
Miinister. Other appointments are made though the Ministry of Labor and
appointments are made on the recommendations of an examining committee on
which MWA is represented. Salaries and wages are determined by the Govern-
ment scale of salaries for public agencies and are generally in line with
Government salaries.

2.05      MWA's General Manager, who is experienced in public administration,
was appointed in late 1976 and, with adequate technical support, appears to
be capable of managing the undertaking. However, operational and accounting
staff are weak and need to be strengthened through the appointment of advisors
and through staff training which is to form an important part of the Project.
2.06      MWA is presently divided into two departments, one headed by a
Director of Technical Operations responsible for the operation and maintenance
of the water supply facilities, and a Director of Finance and Administration
responsible for accounting, purchasing and personnel. MWA will also create
a Project Management and Planning Unit (para. 2.09). MWA's organizational
structure, including the planned change, is shown in Annex 2.1.
2.07      In the past, MWA has been troubled by high staff turnover.  Some
staff have been attracted by higher paid jobs in nearby Middle Eastern Coun-
tries, but Government is attempting to reduce this flow through emigration
controls. It seems unlikely that employee compensation could be increased
to a level competitive with Middle Eastern Countries, although Government
is reviewing the adequacy of present salary scales.
2.08      Both the present Director of Technical Operations and the Director
of Finance and Administration need support in order to carry out their duties
effectively. Therefore, to advise and assist the two Directors, MWA will
appoint a Technical Operations Advisor and a Financial Advisor having ex-
perience, qualifications, duties and responsibilities acceptable to the
Association. The two advisory positions will be retained until Government
and the Association have agreed that they are no longer required. Appoint-
ments to the two positions will be conditions of Credit Effectiveness.
2.09      MWA is to establish a Project Management and Planning Unit (PMPU),
the head of which would report to the General Manager. It is expected that
the functions of this unit will be progressively extended to cover planning,
design and construction of capital projects. In carrying out these functions,
the Unit will monitor and report upon the progress of the Project and handle
payment certificates and Credit withdrawals. MWA is to appoint a qualified,
experienced and competent person as the head of the PMPU and the appointment
of such a person will be a condition of Credit effectiveness.
2.10      To help ensure the continuation of MWA's management capability during
Project implementation, future appointments to the positions of General Manager,
Director of Technical Operations, Director of Finance and Administration, and
head of the PMPU will only be made after the Association has been given a rea-
sonable opportunity to comment on the qualifications, experience and competence
of the persons proposed to fill such positions.
Accounting Practices and Procedures
2.11      MWA's accounting is on a cash basis.  Capital and operating expen-
ditures are included in the same expense classifications. Fixed asset and
depreciation records are not maintained. Physical inventories are periodi-
cally checked as to quantity with bin cards by an internal auditor, but there
is no reconciliation with financial records. Procurement planning has been



- 8 -
weak leading to items having to be ordered at high cost to meet urgent needs.
Accciunts receivable records, although cumbersome, are well maintained but
lack the additional controls which would be provided through a double entry
system.
2.12      As part of the USAID project commissioned in 1973, an accounting
system was designed for MWA by Middle West Service Company, a U.S. consulting
firm. The consultants found it necessary to assume responsibility for the
maintenance of the records and, after their departure, MWA's key staff also
left.  Subsequently, financial reporting and budgeting has been maintained
on a cash basis f'ollowing local government practice in Mogadishu. Due to
circumstances beyond their control, USAID were unable to monitor the prog-
ress' of the accounting system. There appear to be only limited controls
over expenditures as actual performance is not monitored against budgeted
perf'ormance. Because of inadequate information for financial planning, MWA
is Unable to make! effective judgments as to what extent capital spending
should be financed from its internal resources or from loans. MWA has a
number of accounting machines financed by USAID but these are not used and
their precise capability is not known by MWA.
2.13      It is necessary to establish accounting practices along commercial
lines so as to provide adequate information on revenues, capital and operat-
ing expenditures and inventory levels; and also to provide information for
cash forecasting and planning and controlling capital and operating expendi-
ture levels. To help achieve this, accounting specialists whose qualifica-
tions, experience and terms and conditions of employment are acceptable to
the Association, would be employed by January 31, 1979. The accounting
specialists would design and assist in the implementation of a commercial
accounting system and would be responsible for identifying any further staff-
ing needs. FurthLermore, the specialists would be responsible for arranging
or conducting trasining for existing staff.
Billings and Collections
2.14      All water consumption is metered.  Meters are read monthly and 25
meter readers are employed at seven district offices. Bills are prepared at
the Head Office for Government, embassy and fountain sales and at district
offices for private consumer sales.  All bills are checked at the Head Office
and deliveries are made by hand. Disconnections are made if bills are unpaid
withLin about two months of the billing date. Outstanding accounts at the
end of 1976 were equal to about 35 days annual sales which are indicative of
good collection performance.  District offices collect accounts billed by
them and remit collections daily to the Head Office.
Auditing
2.15      There are no private auditing firms operating in Somalia.  The
audits of Government departments and enterprises are conducted by the Magis-
trate of Accounts who is responsible to the President. Government agencies
condLucting commercial activities are audited under the supervision of the
Agencies Branch of the Magistrate of Accounts office.



- 9 -
2.16      The Magistrate of Accounts audit performance on the Bank Group
financed port project in Somalia has been generally satisfactory. The
scope of the audit and report on MWA's accounts would be in accordance with
generally accepted auditing standards and it is expected that the audit per-
formance would be satisfactory. To ensure that future audits continue to
be of a satisfactory standard, MWA will have its accounts audited annually
by auditors acceptable to the Association. MWA's audited accounts would be
submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of the fiscal year.
Scope of MWA Activity
2.17      MWA's present activities are confined to water supply.  However, a
Mogadishu sewerage and drainage project was recently prepared by consultants
and has been appraised by the African Development Fund (AfDF). Government
is seeking co-financing to help meet the project costs. The Ministry of
Public Works will be responsible for project construction. Although Govern-
ment has decided in principle to make MWA responsible for operating the sewer-
age and drainage facilities, no plans have yet been made for doing so. Before
carrying out any plans for extending MWA's activities into the provision of
services other than water supply, Government will inform the Association of
its proposed managerial, staffing and financing plans and afford the Associa-
tion a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon.
Water Development Agency
2.18      WDA would be a minor beneficiary of the Project receiving about
US$50,000 (less than 1%) of the US$6 million Credit. WDA is a Government
agency charged with the responsibility of providing numerous technical
services to the sector. One of its principal activities is tube well con-
struction, part of the cost of which is funded through Government budget
appropriations and part through charges to Government and private enter-
prises. However, WDA's effectiveness has been limited mainly due to short-
ages of experienced drilling superintendents and hydrogeologists, and to
shortages of equipment and supplies (see paras. 1.09 and 1.10).
2.19      Although Government recognizes the need to improve WDA's performance,
it requested that all well construction in the Project be carried out by WDA.
WDA has been evaluated by the consultants, who indicated WDA would be capable
of constructing the wells provided it was strengthened through the addition of
expatriate drilling superintendents and hydrogeologists and the provision of
some items of equipment. This evaluation is acceptable. Accordingly, with a
view to expediting implementation, and with the agreement of the Association,
WDA has been employed to undertake the water resource investigations partly
financed through the Project Preparation Facility, subject to price safeguards
satisfactory to the Association. As noted in para. 4.08, remaining well drill-
ing contracts included in the Project would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding in which WDA would be permitted to participate.

Manpower Development and Training
2.20      Due to the importance placed by Government on the urgent need to
develop the entire water supply sector, and given the weakness of the exist-
ing organizations and the current scarcity of training resources, the pro-
posed Project would include a US$770,000 training component which would be
implemented in two stages.
2.21      The first stage would be to make an overall assessment of sector
training needs as a basis for determining the scope, cost and expected bene-
fits of a water supply sector training program. As there is no agency in
Somalia capable of undertaking this work, consultants will be employed,
not later than January 31, 1979, on terms and conditions acceptable to the
Association to assess the training needs of all sector agencies and to prepare
a detailed schedule and description of a training plan for MWA and the con-
sultants' recommendations will be furnished to the Association not later than
July 31, 1979. It is anticipated that implementation of the elements of the
program relating to sector agencies other than MWA would be included in sub-
sequent external assistance projects.
2.22      The second stage of the proposed training component would be the
implementation of a training program designed to strengthen the operational
and accounting functions of MWA. The principal objectives would be to:
(a)  strengthen and upgrade the present operational and
maintenance performance of MWA; to help to develop
an effective commercial accounting system and prepare
MWA, in all departments, for the implementation of
the Project and, subsequently, the Phase II project;
and
(b) enable MWA to develop a permanent training capability
with appropriate resources and local expertise which
would, in turn, be available to assist other urban
water supply agencies, particularly in training for
water distribution and pumping operations.
2.23      Government and MWA have agreed that MWA, with the assistance of
consultants employecd on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association,
will promptly carry out the training program agreed with the Association.

III. DEMAND AND MARKET ANALYSIS
Background
3.01      Meaningful records of water consumption and production are limited
to thes period since 1973 when MWA's existing water system was commissioned.
Prior to 1973, service was provided to the majority of the population from
privately-owned we:Lls with the balance of the population mainly served from
the former municipal system now abandoned due to deterioration of facilities
and to degradation of ground water quality by seawater intrusion. All MWA
individual sources of supply and service connections are metered. Records of
consumption and production are believed to be reasonably complete although,
in view of the high mineral content of the water and the apparent low level
of meter maintenance, meter accuracy needs to be confirmed.
Existing Facilities and Service
3.02      MIA's existing water system consists of several sources of supply,
of which the Balad Road well field is the principal element, plus various
facilities for treatment and storage prior to delivery of the water to
consuaLers. The Balad Road well field, which was financed largely by USAID,
is located north of Mogadishu about 10 km inland from the coast. A system
of collector mains and a 9 km long tranmission main deliver the water to
Mogadishu. Two storage reservoirs, a booster station and a distribution
system consisting of in excess of 100 km of mains varying from 50 mm (2") to
500 mm (20") in diameter currently provide service from two separate pressure
zones to customers through about 8000 individual connections and 300 kiosks.
The Balad Road supply is supplemented with production from several small-
capacity tube wells located in Mogadishu. Due to marginal water quality,
however, the latter wells are not connected to the distribution system but
serve as individual water points for residential users and for livestock.
3.03      As originally planned, the 1173 improvements were sized to meet
maximumu-day system demands of 31,500 m /day forecast for 1980.  Due to a
subsequent restriction in the number of wells and the inability to obtain
planned-for unit weLl yiehds, however, the field was only able to produce a
maximumu of about 24,000 m /day at the time of commissioning. The subsequent
failure of two of the original 19 wells and declining production at the
rSmain:ing wells have reduced total installed capacity to a current 19,000
m /day. Due to lowering ground water levels, coupled with the suspected clog-
ging oi well strainers due to incrustation, a continuation of the past trend
of declining production capacity 1/ is expected at the field. However, it is
expected that some of this lost capacity can be recovered through rehabilita-
tion of individual wells.
1/   This decline in production capacity has averaged 3% annually.



- 13 -
Historical Water Demands
3.04      1974 was the first full year for which records of demand were avail-
able and, therefore, it is difficult to establish a long-term trend based upon
historical experience. As indicated in Table 3-1, increases in annual metered
consumption averaged in excess of 20% during the period 1974-76. This rate
of growth is not likely to be sustained over a long term since it has depended
upon several unique situations occurring simultaneously, viz., (a) the start-
up of a new system, (b) a population in-migration due to a prolonged drought
in inland areas, (c) a backlog of potential customers requesting water ser-
vice, and (d) capacity to install new connections.

Composition of Demand
3.05      Approximately half of the water consumed in Mogadishu is for govern-
mental and institutional use. Residential usage represents slightly less
than 50% of total consumption. In 1976 private connections provided ser-
vice to only about 9% of a household population of 400,000 and accounted for
about 22% of the total consumption. As noted in Table 3-2, little change in
composition of demand has occurred during the period 1974-76.

Factors Affecting Future Demand
3.06      Demand forecasts recognize three basic categories of future consump-
tion: residential, institutional and industrial. Projected residential
consumption is tied to population growth but also is dependent upon household
size and per capita consumption, the latter of which is further related to
housing type of which four basic types are recognized (see Table 6-2). Insti-
tutional consumption, which includes Governmental, is expected to increase
generally in accordance with population. Industrial consumption, which is
currently small and expected to remain so for the foreseeable future, is
expected to grow in general conformance with Somalia's GDP.
3.07      Based upon recent trends and the current backlog of applications for
service, the growth of demand is not constrained by the cost of providing ser-
vice 1/ but is expected to be dependent upon the ability of MWA service crews
to meet future requests for new service connections. In recognition of the
probability that the yield from MWA's existing Balad Road well field cannot be
significantly increased, in May 1977 MWA decreed that a water supply emergency
existed and that new service connections would be limited until the emergency
order is rescindedl. However, the installation of kiosks would not be simi-
larly, limited. In practice the decree was applied effectively only during
May-September 1977 and relaxed as soon as water shortages at source became
less apparent. However, Government and MWA have given assurances that, after
satisfying a backlog of applications for service existing at April 15, 1978 up
to a maximum of 400, new private water connections would be limited to no more
than 70 each year until future expansion of MWA supply capacity would make
such limitation unnecessary. Moreover, these additions would be permitted
only if, and to the extent that, they would have no reasonable effect upon
Mogadishu's water supply situation. Mogadishu's water supply constraints are
not likely to be eliminated until the commissioning of the Phase II Mogadishu
water supply project tentatively expected by 1982.
Population Forecast
3.08      Past population estimates of Mogadishu have not been reliable and,
due to the influx of nomads from inland areas because of the recent drought,
the total 1976 population of 445,000 estimated by the consultants is subject
to some uncertainty. Despite this, in view of the short-term nature of the
Project and the limited increase in supply capacity provided, the mission
has accepted the consultants' projection and a reasonable trend of popula-
tion growth was established based upon the experience of other nearby African
countries. Future population has been estimated based upon a natural rate of
increase of 3% compounded annually and an annual net in-migration of 20,000.
1/   The cost of installing a new private service connection approximates
So.Sh. 300 (excluding the cost of customer meter) and is borne by the
customer at the time that the application for service is submitted.
Current sales price at kiosks 3and for customers with individual house
connections is So.Sh. 3 per m . Customary sales price for delivery of
fresh water by vendors p5ior to completion of the existing system in
1973 was So.Sh. 14 per m



- 15 -
3.09      As the consultant's demand forecast (see para 3.06 for basis of
forecast) appears high, a revised demand forecast (Annex 3.1) was prepared
on the basis that growth in demand for the period 1976-82 is likely to be
constrained by supply capacity. Unaccounted-for-water, the difference be-
tween consumption and production, has been assumed to remain at about 20%
of production. In the absence of a longer period of record, and in the
expectation that meter maintenance procedures will improve, this seems
reasonable.
Variation in Demand
3.10      Evaluation of likely variations in demand is important in planning
and sizing elements of the expanded Mogadishu water system. Annex 3.2 shows
future demands based upon different peaking factors for selected time periods.
Only the factor shown for a maximum-demand month was based upon Mogadishu
experience. Factors used for other time periods were based upon the consul-
tants' experience with other water systems located elsewhere in the region.
This approach is reasonable. Water systems normally are designed so that
peak demand is not imposed directly upon the sources of supply. In the case
of Mogadishu, operational storage capacity in each of the two service zones
is able to absorb existing momentary differences in supply and3demand. System
reservoirs, with a combined capacity of approximately 22,000 m (5.8 million
U.S. gallons), currently provide the equivalent of slightly over one day's
storage at the average day demand rate projected for 1979. This storage
capacity is considered sufficient for the present and no additions to capac-
ity are proposed as part of the Project.
Interim Improvements by MWA
3.11      Due to the combination of increasing water demands and declining
production capacity, some suppressed demand has become evident and the
situation is likely to worsen before becoming better. During much of 1977,
all available well units were kept operating continuously 24 hours a day.
Due to the lack of standby or reserve capacity, required maintenance could
not be accomplished and it now appears that major maintenance of mechanical
equipment will have to be deferred until significant additions to capacity
can be made.
3.12      Recognizing the seriousness of the situation, and with the expec-
tation that the proposed Project will not be effective until late 1979,
MWA has taken steps which, if successful, will result in additions to supply
capacity in late 1977 and in 1978. These additions include the construction
of six new wells and the reactivation of existing dug wells in and adjacent
to the City and an interim extension of the Balad Road well field. Due to
marginal water quality likely to be available from the City wells, their
future usefulness can be questioned. There also is uncertainty over the
probable effectiveness of MWA's Interim Improvement Program due to the little
emphasis on engineering and the utilization of WDA for well construction
without proper direction and supervision.

Production Capacity Provided by Project
3.13       AdditiorLs to production capacity included in the proposed Project
(Phase I) will constitute only a modest extension of Mogadishu's existing
Balad Road well field.  These additions will bring the combined production
capacity of these wells close to current estimates of the well field's safe
yield and to the economic capacity of the transmission main. Although over-
production from the field is possible through the introduction of additional
wells, such additi'onal production is likely to be only temporary in nature
and at the expense of future production. Overproduction also could have
long--lasting, detrimental effects upon the area's ground water levels and
quali'ty. Thus, effective additions to supply capacity cannot be made until
better information is available concerning the area' s ground water resources
and a much larger project including such additions can be identified, prepared
and implemented. The Project (Phase I) would provide improved information
through inclusion of water resource investigations. The subsequent Phase II
project would then utilize this information in providing the required addi-
tions to supply capacity.
3.14       Annexes 3.2 and 3.3 show existing and proposed MWA production
capacity. Annex 3.3 particularly indicates the critical shortage of supply
capacity with the possibility of suppressed demand occurring from 1975 until
the completion of Phase II facilities scheduled for 1982. Supply additions
to be included as part of MWA's Interim Improvement Program and the proposed
Project (Phase I) will not materially change the relationship between supply
and clemand but will merely prevent it from getting worse. An historical loss
of production capacity averaging about 3% per year annually has been assumed
to continue to affect MWA's future well production.

IV. THE PROJECT
Scope of Project
4.01      The3proposed Project (Phase I) will increase supply capacity by
about 8,000 m /day, which is roughly equivalent to 18 months' growth in
maximum day demand. The incremental addition is sized so as to increase
the effective capacity of the Balad Road well field up to the 31,500 m /day
installed capacity of the transmission facilities provided by the previous
1973 project. A larger water supply component has been deferred until later
when better information is available concerning the extent of local water re-
sourcess (see para. 1.19). Water resource investigations (a portion of which
are being financed from the Bank Group's PPF) required to assist in the prep-
aration of the Phase II project constitute an important element of the
Project. The balance of Project components were selected to strengthen MWA
instiltutionally and, in general, to provide for improved future service in
the sector.
Project Description
4.02      Major Project components consist of the following:
(a)  Water resource investigations including the drilling of
test holes and bore holes, the retention of consultants,
and the iEurnishing of associated advisory, monitoring and
reporting services.
(b) Construction work including: (i) the extension of Balad
Road well field through the drilling, development and
equipping of ibout 8 additional wells to produce approxi-
mately 8000 m /day (1,467 US gpm); (ii) the extension and
modification of Balad Road well field collector mains,
and transmission main; (iii) the extension and modifica-
tion of power plant and electrical supply grid at Balad
Road well field; (iv) the provision for standby pump set
at existing city booster station; (v) the extension of
water distribution grid and construction of about 40
additional public hydrants and; (vi) the construction
of workshop and field staff quarters.
(c)  Procurement of the following equipment:  (i) vehicles and
maintenance equipment; (ii) tools and workshop equipment;
(iii) communications equipment; and (iv) laboratory and
water treatment equipment.
(d)  Support of advisors to be appointed by MWA as counter-
parts to the directors of Finance and Administration,
and Technical Operations (see para. 4.12).
(e)  Support of proposed Project Management and Planning
Unit (see para. 4.13).



- 21 -
(f) Training component including: (i) identification of
detailed training needs of MWA and WDA; (ii) implemen-
tation of training program for MWA.
(g) Consulting services for: (i) engineering design and
supervision of construction for the Project; (ii) en-
gineering design of the following Phase II project;
(iii) accountancy and financial management; and (iv)
tariff studies.
Cost Estimates
4.03      The estimated total cost of the Project is So.Sh. 48.6 million
(US$7.7 million equivalent) and excludes taxes and duties. Foreign exchange
costs would amount to US$5.8 million or 75% of the total expenditures. A
detailed breakdown of the cost estimates is shown in Annex 4.1 and can be
summarized as follows:

4.04      Cost estimates are based upon preliminary Project design and are
expressed in terms of mid-1978 price levels. An allowance ranging from 10% to
20% was added to baseline costs for physical contingencies. The 20% allowance
was applied to water resource investigations, borehole construction, and
rehabilitation of existing wells due to uncertainty relative to the extent and
nature of this work. Due to expected variations in the depths and locations
of proposed wells, an allowance of 15% was used for the costs of well casing,
collector mains, and pumping equipment, while a 10% allowance was used on
remaining components. Annual price contingency factors shown below were
applied to baseline costs and to physical contingencies. Government has
indicated that it would waive duties and taxes on all imported goods and
services required for the Project.

Financing of Project
4.05      The proposed IDA Credit of U$6 million equivalent would be used to
finance all foreign costs and approximately US$200,000 equivalent of local
costs of selected components and would cover about 78% of the total Project
costs. These would include costs associated with the water resource investi-
gations and that portion of said costs paid by advances from the PPF (see
para. 4.01). The advances would be reimbursed from the Credit when it becomes
effective. The allocation of the proposed Project costs between MWA and WDA
and the related financing sources are given below:

Project Implementation
4.06      A Project Management and Planning Unit (PMPU) to be formed within
MWA will be responsible for Project management (see para. 2.09) but MWA would
utilize engineering consultants for detailed design, preparation of tender
documents, evaluation of tenders and construction supervision. 1/  MWA has
retained Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners (Africa), a Nairobi-based firm in-
volved in Project pre-investment studies, for this purpose and this arrange-
ment is acceptable. The Institute of Hydrology (UK) is associated with Gibb
in carrying out the water resource investigations and subsequent source
development work. It has been agreed that MWA would continue to retain
engineering consultants whose qualifications, experience, and terms and
conditions of emplcoyment would be satisfactory to IDA. The Consultant began
work associated with the water resource investigations in November 1977 and
the investigations are scheduled to be complete by early 1979. All Project
1/   Total engineering effort is estimated at 370 man-months of which 220 man-
months would be required for detailed design and preparation of tender
documents for the following (Phase II) project. Average total cost per
man-month projected for engineering approximates US$3,750.

physical works would be completed by March 1980 while all remaining Project
elements would be completed by late 1981. A bar chart showing physical
elements and timing of the work program is included as Annex 4.2.
Advance Contracting and Retroactive Finance
4.07      Due to an urgent need to supplement existing water supply capacity
(see paras. 3.13 and 3.14), MWA intends to proceed as rapidly as possible
with the water resource investigations and with the implementation of Project
components which will result in increased production capacity. There also
is a critical need to begin efforts to strengthen MWA. The water resource
investigations are being partly financed through US$500,000 PPF finance and
up to this amount is expected to be reimbursed through the IDA Credit when
it becomes effective. In addition to the above, retroactive finance of up
to US$400,000 equivalent is proposed for consulting services, procurement of
equipment and materials and, in general, to expedite Project implementation.
Procurement
4.08      Approximately 60% of the total Project costs would involve construc-
tion and supply contracts. Mechanical and electrical equipment and pipe are
not manufactured locally and would be procured from abroad. Except as noted
below, all construction and supply contracts financed by the proposed IDA
Credit would be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding
(ICB) in accordance with Bank Group guidelines. The exceptions consist of
drilling of boreholes and the furnishing of selected equipment, materials and
supplies urgently required for the water resource investigations. MWA has re-
tained WDA, through a negotiated contract, for all drilling services required
in the investigations 1/ but would follow ICB procedures in contracting for
the rehabilitation of existing wells and for all other Project drilling. 2/
In view of the urgency, the Association has agreed to WDA participation in
the investigations and has approved of the terms and conditions of their
employment. WDA would be permitted to bid on the balance of drilling work not
included in the investigations. In the absence of an expression of interest
by other qualified bidders (interest is unlikely in view of the small amount
of drilling work remaining), MWA would have no alternative but to negotiate
with WDA in contracting for this work.
4.09      Should domestic contractors (including WDA) bid for all or a por-
tion of civil works in ICB, a preference of 7-1/2% would be applied to these
bids.
1/   Drilling costs for the water resource investigations are estimated at
US$700,000 of which about US$200,000 would be financed from the PPF.
2/   The cost of this remaining work, including the rehabilitation of exist-
ing wells, is estimated at about US$600,000.



- 24 -
Disbursement
4.10      The IDA Credit would be disbursed to meet selected portions of the
Project cost as follows: (i) 100% of total expenditure on civil works (in-
cluding the cost of drilling boreholes not included in the water resource
investigations); (ii) 100% of the foreign exchange costs of equipment and
supplies; (iii) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of advisors, consultants
and/or specialists; (iv) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of the training
component; and (v) 100% of the refunding of the project preparation advance.
An estimated disbursement schedule is given in Table 4-1. Any Credit funds
undisbursed at the end of the Project would be cancelled.

Closing Date
4.11      The proposed closing date for the IDA Credit would be June 30,
1982. This allows a margin of six to eight months after the estimated
completion of work by the counterpart advisors, training consultants, and
engineering consultants.

Counterpart Advisors
4.12      Existing MWA staff do not have the requisite training or expe-
rience to provide the General Manager, who is a recent appointee without
prior experience in the water supply sector, with adequate technical support.
To address this problem, the Project would provide funds for- che temporary
appointment of two senior advisors as counterparts to the Directors of the
departments of Finance and Administration, and Technical Operations (see
para. 2.08). It is estimated that counterpart advisors would be required for
72 man-months at a cost of US$4,500 per man-month.
Project Management and Planning Unit
4.13      The Project includes the cost of a Project Management and Planning
Unit to be created to assist in Project implementation (see para. 2.09).
Training
4.14      A comprehensive training component would be included in the Project
to identify specific training needs of the water supply sector and to further
strengthen MWA. Although the details of the proposed program still are not
known, 11 the immediate thrust of training efforts would be to strengthen MWA
maintenance and operation functions, to strengthen MWA accounting procedures,
and, possibly, to assist in the upgrading of WDA well drilling crews (see
paras. 2.22 to 2.26). The latter would supplement ongoing and proposed
training efforts provided through German assistance (see para. 1.16). It is
estimated that 54 man-months of consultancy services would be required at a
cost of US$5,000 per man-month.
Management Specialists
4.15      Management specialists also would be provided to establish appro-
priate accounting procedures for MWA. The specialists would be required
to assist in the implementation of such procedures and to develop a job-
related training program (see paras. 2.22 and 4.14). This assignment is
estimated to require about 12 man-months at about US$5,000 per man-month.
Tariff Studies
4.16      Consultants also would be retained to review MWA's tariff level
and structure and to make such recommendations as are considered necessary
(see para. 5.05).
Environmental Impact
4.17      The Project would have a negligible environmental impact although
some improvements to public health are anticipated (see para. 6.11). Con-
struction efforts should cause only minor inconvenience to the resident
population.
1/   Consultants would be retained in the Project cycle to evaluate
specific needs and to design a program to meet these needs.

Monitoring Criteria
4.18      The progress of the water resource investigations and construction,
the Project costs, disbursements, MWA's internal cash generati.on, and im-
plementation of the training program are important elements to be monitored
through periodic progress reports during implementation of the Project.
However, other less critical indicators also would be monitored during and
following Project implementation in order to measure the achievement of
technical, financial, administrative and training goals set for the proposed
Project.  These indicators are illustrated in Annex 4.3.  Due to incomplete
MWA records, ce:rtain of the indicators have not been quantified. An effort
would be made, through communications with MWA, to confirm the reasonableness
of those indicators that have been quantified and fill in those indicators
that are not yet known. Promptly after Project completion, MWA will submit
to the Association a report on the execution and operation of the Project
and related matters.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past History anid Present Financial Position
5.D01     As noted in para. 2.11, MWA's financial records are prepared on a
cash basis and are not intended for the evaluation of MWA's financial perform-
ance. The valu,e of water sales grew by 21% in 1976 over the previous year,
but supply constraints limited consumption in 1977.  Available information
suggests that MWA's revenues over the last few years have been sufficient to
meet cash operating expenses and debt service, to finance minor capital ex-
penditures and additions to working capital, and also to accumulate a small
cash surplus to help finance capital spending. This accumulation would have
been greater had MWA been paid for water supplied to the Mogadishu Municipal-
ity. For examp]Le, revenue from this source would have amounted to about
So Sh. 1.4 mill.ion (US$0.22 million) in 1976, about 8% of MWA's revenues. It
is estimated that, of MWA's total assets at December 31, 1976 (including net
current assets), about 62% were financed from loans, 10% from grants, and 28%
from retained earnings.
5.02      MWA's transactions with the Municipality of Mogadishu have not been
wholly conducted on a commercial basis. As noted in para. 5.01, MWA has sup-
plied water to the Municipality without payment.  However, from January 1978   3
the Municipality will pay for water consumed at the flat rate of So.Sh. 3 per m
chatrged to other consumers. All future transactions between MWA and the Munic-
ipality will be handled on a commercial basis and be based upon reasonable
charges.
5.03      MWA does not maintain fixed asset records.  Fixed assets consist
substantially of assets constructed under the USAID project completed in 1973
at a cost of So.Sb. 68.5 million (US$10.8 million) and, although records of
additions since then are inadequate, additions have probably not exceeded 3%
of the cost of the USAID Project. Part of the accounting consultants' work
(see para. 2.13) would consist of the establishment of fixed asset records.
It is necessary to revalue the fixed assets to reflect more closely current
costs and it may be expedient to use the Mogadishu Cost of Living Index for
this purpose. This index indicates an overall increase in the cost of living
in Mogadishu of about 60% between 1973 and 1976, but this rate of increase
appears to be moderating considerably. MWA's fixed assets are to be revalued
by September 30, 1979 and revalued annually after that date using methods
acceptable to the Association. As the cost of future major additions could
be estimated at that time (see para. 5.05), it would then be appropriate to
establish appropriate financial rate of return performance standards based on
revalued fixed assets.
Tariffs
5.04       The flat rate tariff of So.Sh. 3 per m3 (US$1.80 per thousand U.S.
gal), which is high by comparison to most other countries in the Eastern



- 31 -
Africa Region, 1/ has remained unchanged since MWA became operational in 1973.
Water production costs in Mogadishu are high because of the relatively low
yield characteristic of the supply sources. There is a minimum water charge of
So.Sh. 10 per month (US$1.59) and a fixed meter rental charge of So.Sh. 2.50
per month (US$0.40). About 25% of the quantity of water sold by MWA is
through kiosks. The concessionaires are paid a commission of So.Sh. 1.5 per
m  (US$0.90 per thousand US gal) supplied 3thus leaving the net cost of water
to the concessionaire at So.Sh. 1.5 per m (US$0.90 per thousand US gal). The
concessionaires pay the kiosk maintenance costs. Much of the water purchased
from kiosks is distributed to consumers by private vendors whose selling price
apparently varies, depending Sn the distance water is carried, but is believed
to be at least So.Sh. 6 per m (US$3.61 per thousand US gal). Selling prices
are not controlled and it is doubtful that this would be possible under the
present system for distributing water. The proposed Project, by increasing
the number of kiosks, would tend to reduce water prices to consumers as more
consumers would purchase water directly from kiosks.
5.05      Changes to the present day tariff may be needed to take into account
MWA's long-term financial needs and long-term water supply costs. However, no
reliable estimates can be made of the nature, cost and financing plan for the
next major production capacity addition (Phase II) until about mid-1979 fol-
lowing the completion of the water resource investigations which are being
financed under the proposed Project. Therefore, MWA will employ consultants
on terms and conditions acceptable to the Association to complete by September
30, 1979 a study to recommend such changes to MWA's tariff structure and level
as are considered necessary. Before taking any action to modify the level or
structure of MWA tariff both the recommendations of the study and the Associa-
tion's comments will be taken into account by the Government and MWA. Mean-
time, MWA will not reduce its tariff below the current level and will maintain
the tariff at a level no less than is adequate to cover cash operating expenses
and depreciation or debt service, whichever is the larger.
Proposed Financing
5.06      It is estimated that MWA's capital requirements during the Project
disbursement period 1978-82 would amount to So.Sh. 293.93 million (US$46.69
million). During this period, it is estimated that expenditures on the next
major project would be about four times those on the proposed Project. Under
the tentative financing plan shown below, MWA would provide 24% of its
capital requirements from internal cash generation, 73% would be provided
from loans, 2% from Government grants and 1% from consumers.
1/   Some examples of 1977 water rates in other countries of the Eastern
Africa Region expressed in US$ per thousand U.S. gal. and shadow-priced
where appropriate are Blantyre, Malawi: US$1.10; Gaborone, Botswana:
US$1.05; Mombasa, Kenya: US$1.81 and Nairobi, Kenya: US$0.91. The
comparable MWA water rate, with shadow pricing, would be US$1.26.

expected to extend until 1983.
/2   This includes interest on Government on-lending of the proportion of
the proposed IDA loan allocated to MWA and interest on the next major
project.
/3   Excludes interest during construction financed through loans.
/4   This represents proportion of the the proposed US$6 million IDA credit
allocated to MWA.
5.07      Based oII crude estimates of the Phase II project, referred to in
para., 5.05, construction of which is expected to start in 1980, expenditures
on this project would amount to So.Sh. 191 million (US$30 million) between
1978 to 1982 as compared to only So.Sh. 48.20 million (US$7.66 million) on
the proposed Project. Government intends to seek Bank Group assistance to
help finance the Phase II project. As indicated in para. 5.05, the extent
of arLy required tariff adjustments related to future capital spending would
be assessed in late 1979.  In the financing plan given in para. 5.06, it has
been assumed that tiriff increases would be made to increase average rerenues
from So.Sh. 3 per m (US$1.80 per thousand US gal) to So.Sh. 4.50 per m



- 33 -
(US$2.70 per thousand US gal) on January 1, 1980 and to So.Sh. 5.75 per m
(US$3.45 per thousand US gal) on January 1, 1981. This would allow 20% of
Phase II project costs to be met from internal cash generation.
5.08      The proceeds of that part of the IDA Credit allocated to MWA (about
US$5.95 million out of US$6 million) would be relent by Gove.iment to MWA over
20 years, including a 4-year grace period, at a 7% interest rate and interest
would be financed through borrowings until 1980 with combined level payments
of principal and interest commencing in 1981. Execution of a subsidiary loan
agreement between the Government and MWA would be a condition of Credit effec-
tiveness. It has been assumed that Phase II financing would be on similar
terms with debt service commencing 1983. Government is also to provide MWA
with a grant of So.Sh. 5.35 million (US$0.85 million) to help finance the cost
of the water resource investigations forming part of the Phase I project.
Future Performance
5.09      Forecast cash flow projections, income statements and balance sheets
covering 1977-84 are presented in Annexes 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, followed by ex-
planatory notes in Annex 5.4. Based on the assumptions in paras. 5.07 and
5.08, it is expected that MWA's future operating performance will be satis-
factory as indicated by the following projected financial data. However, a
better assessment of MWA'S future financial performance can be made when the
cost and financing plan for the next project are known and related tariff
increases have been planned. The rate of return on revalued fixed assets
is an estimate assuming an initial revaluation of 50% as of December 31, 1976
and an 8% annual revaluation thereafter.

5.10      To help ensure a sound financial structure, MWA will not incur debt
without IDA approval unless future debt service, including that of proposed
borrowings, is covered at least 1.4 times by internal cash generation and,
until Project completion, MWA will not incur annual capital expenditures,
other than for the proposed Project, in excess of US$250,000 equivalent
without a financing plan approved by the Association.

Notes to Financial Statements
General
1.        The financial statements have been prepared from information sup-
plied by MWA and Gibb.
Income Statement
Revenue
2.        Water consumption forecasts are derived from Chapter III, Annex 3.1.
It has been assumed that the 3tariff would be raised to produce average   3
revenues of So.Sh. 4.5 per m on January 1, 1980 and to So.Sh. 5.75 per m on
January 1, 1981.
Expenses
3.        Except where otherwise indicated, a 9% inflation rate has been added
to estimated expenses in addition to the estimated real increases in expenses,
as indicated below.
Salaries, Wages and Other Employment Costs
4.        These are assumed to increase by 8% per annum.
Fuel Oil
5.        This is based on water production.  An immediate price increase of
80% has been provided for based on information supplied to the mission.
Chemicals
6.        Chemical costs are assumed to increase in proportion to production.
Repairs and Maintenance and General Expenses
7.        These costs are assumed to increase by 8% per annum.
Fountain Concessionaires Commission
8.        This is based on projected kiosk sales volume.  Kiosk concessionaires
receive a commission of So.Sh. 1.5 per m  out of which they pay kiosk mainte- 3
nance costs. The net cost of water to the concessiolaires is So.Sh. 1.5 per m
(So.Sh. 3 per m less commission of So.Sh. 1.5 per m).

ANNEX 5.4
Page 2 of 3
Depreciation
9.        Depreciation has been taken at an average of 6% per annum.  This
is higher than normal for water supply undertakings because supply is mainly
frorm low-yield sources reflecting relatively short service lives.
Annual Payment to Mogadishu Water Agency
10.       There is no firm agreement between MWA and the Municipality regard-
ing an annual payment and it has been assumed, in the financial projections,
that: the present annual payment of So.Sh. 0.5 million will continue although
it is expected to be renegotiated. The present payment is understood to
compensate the Mtnicipality for the small water supply system which MWA took
over on its inception.
Transactions Between MWA and the Municipality
11.       Government has now agreed that the terms of all commercial trans-
actions between MWA and the Municipality will be settled on the basis of
reasonable charges.
Balance Sheet
Fixed Assets
12.       An initial 50% revaluation of fixed assets has been assumed as of
December 31, 1976, and an 8% annual revaluation thereafter.
Accounts Receivable
13.       These are assumed to amount to 40 days average sales based on past
collection performance.
Inventories
14.       Inventories are high because of delivery uncertainties, and nominal
additions have been assumed each year.
Accounts Payable
15.       These are assumed to be equal to about 45 days operating expenses.
IDA Credit
16.       It has been assumed that Government would lend the proceeds of
that part of the IDA Credit benefiting MWA, estimated at So.Sh. 37.47 million



- 39 -

Page 3 of 3
(US$5.95 million), at 7% interest over 20 years, including a grace period of
4 years. Interest during construction would be added to the principal amount
of the loan.
Unarranged Loan (for Phase II Project following IDA Project)
17.       It has been assumed that 80% of the estimated Phase II project
costs would be financed through borrowings on terms similar to the relending
of the IDA Credit.
USAID Loan
18.       Under the terms of a loan agreement dated January 7, 1968 between
Somalia, MWA and the U.S., MWA is to repay Government over 30 years from date
of first loan disbursements, including a 5-year grace period, by equal semi-
annual principal installments together with interest at 3-1/2% per annum.
The final principal installment is due January 20, 1999.
Grants
19.       Government has agreed to provide MWA with a grant of So.Sh. 5.35
million (US$0.85 million) to help-finance the cost of the water resource
investigations forming part of the Phase I project.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Satisfaction of Demand
6.01      The population of Mogadishu, about 445,000 persons in 1976, is
growing at a rate of about 6%, or over twice the national growth rate of
2.4%. During the limited period of record (1974-76), however, Mogadishu's
annual water demand has grown at a rate more than three times the rate of
its population increase. Due to this past rapid increase in system demand
coupled with a gradual decline in production capacity (see para. 3.03),
existing production facilities now are fully utilized and some suppression
of demand has been experienced (see paras. 3.13 and 3.14).
6.02      Since the Project would provide an incremental addition equivalent
only to about 18 months' growth of maximum-day demand, and since interim
improvements currently in progress by MWA similarly are limited, the water
supply situation is likely to remain critical until the commissioning of the
Phase II project expected in 1982. MWA has recognized the seriousness of this
problem by limiting new private water connections. The limitation would not
limit: the installation of public standposts. The combined effect of this
limit:ation, when considered together with constraints in supply capacity, is
estimated in Table! 6-1.

1980          8,268           6,898            1,370          17

6.03      By limiting new connections mainly to public standposts, improved
water service would be extended to that portion of the population now largely
dependent upon water delivery by donkey cart or who have to transport water
relatively long distances from existing standposts. Such limitation of
service would assure utilization of this limited resource by the maximum
number of people since per capita consumption associated with standpost
service is significantly less than consumption through house connections
(see Table 6-2).

IV          Temporary houses                                4.25
Benefits to Urban Poor
6.04      Project benefits would mainly accrue to population resident in low-
cost and temporary houses who, in Mogadishu, constitute the urban poor. The
benefits would consist of an increased number of persons served, improved
access to water and, for those customers changing their mode of delivery
froI vendor to public standpist, a reduced water charge (from a present So.Sh.
6/m , or more, to So.Sh. 3/m ).  Service would be extended by the Project to
an additional urban poor population of 29,000 (443,000 in 1982 less 414,000 in
1979).
More Reliable Water Service
6.05      The MWA system currently is operating with insufficient reserve
capacity at the Balad Road power plant and the City booster station. Due to
the need to continuously operate most units, it is impossible to carry out
major maintenance without further suppression of demand and system reliabi-
lity is therefore constrained. The Project would improve reserve capacity
through the addition of engine-generator sets 1/ at the Balad Road power
plant and the provision of an extra pump set at the City booster station.
1/   Possibly supplemented with a connection to the Mogadishu-Balad electric
transmission line currently proposed by Exite National Energia Electrica
(ENEE). Studies are planned by MWA relative to the cost and availability
of energy from this alternative source. If the results of these studies
are favorable, and if the timing of construction is satisfactory, the
additional capacity to be provided by engine-generator sets would be
reduced and the corresponding capacity instead would be secured from

Least-Cost Alternative
6.06      Due to the existence of un-utilized capacity in the existing
transmission main from the Balad Road well field, an increase in production
capacity at that source is the least-cost means of providing a short-term
increase in the availability of water to meet Mogadishu's immediate needs.
A long-term solution must await the outcome of the water resource investi-
gations included in the Project.
Strengthening of Water Supply Sector
6.07      The Somalia water supply sector, of which MWA represents a signifi-
cant part, has obvious needs for institutional development. To address these
needs, the Project includes: (a) support of counterpart advisors to MWA man-
agement; (b) support of proposed Project Management and Planning Unit; (c)
identification of training needs and implementation of training program; and
(d) consultants' services for accountancy and financial management. While
the principal thrust of these efforts would benefit mainly MWA, the staffing
and training needs of the entire sector also would be evaluatecl.
Retarn on Investment
6.03      Only that portion of Project costs affecting additions to capacity
or betterments to service was used in calculating return on investment (ROI)
and in calculating average incremental costs referred to in paragraph 6.10.
Specifically excLuded are those costs associated with: (a) the preparation
and engineering design of the following Phase II project, (b) a portion of
the training program estimated to produce benefits beyond those related to
existing facilities and facilities to be added by the Project, and (c) tariff
studies. The included costs are estimated to total about US$4.8 million
equivalent, or 62% of total Project costs.  ROI on the Project was taken to
be t:he discount rate at which the present worth of Project costs including
all capital and operating costs, but excluding taxes and duties, equals the
present worth of related benefits. Costs attributed to the Project aSe based
upon mid-1978 price levels while the current tariff of So.Sh. 3 per m  was
used in calculating benefits. ROI on the Project is 14.6%. Shadow pricing
of the foreign cost component of capital and recurring costs results in a
reduction of ROI to 9.1%. The latter value demonstrates that, on average,
the tariff will reflect the cost of supply. However, the economic rate of
return, as calculated, is an underestimate of Project benefits since the
consumer surplus is not reflected by using revenues as a benefit: proxy.
Sensitivity Analysis
6.09      A sensitivity analysis shows that ROI is moderately sensitive to
capital costs. For a 10% increase in Project costs, without shadow pricing,
ROI would decrease to about 13.1% while a 20% increase in Project costs
would cause ROI to decrease to 11.8%. With shadow pricing, comparable values
of ROI would be 8.4% and 7.3%, respectively.

Average Incremental Costs
6.10      Reliable information about the nature and cost of the next major
(Phase II) project are not available and, therefore, calculations of average
incremental cost (AIC) are limited only to the proposed Project. On this
basis, assuu-ng the opportunity cost of capital to be within 3the range of 8%
to 12%, the AIC varies from So.Sh. 2.05 to So.Sh. 2.60 per m . Shadow pric-
ing of foreign cost components of tqe Project would increase AIC to the range
of So.Sh. 2.72 3to So.Sh. 3.45 per m , which brackets the current tariff of
So.Sh. 3 per m . In the absence of a capital market in Somalia, no precise
estimate of the opportunity cost of capital is possible. Annex 6.1 describes
the assumptions used in calculating AIC and ROI and gives details of the cal-
culations.
Non-quantifiable Benefits
6.11      Additional, though non-quantifiable, benefits would result from
the Project based upon the extension of safe water service to additional
populations. These benefits would include a reduction of incidences of
water-borne and sanitation-associated disease commonly occurring throughout
Somalia (see para. 1.07). Contributing to the Project benefits is the im-
proved access provided to current customers through construction of additional
public hydrants.
Risks
6.12      The main Project risks are that, because of institutional weak-
nesses, construction may be delayed thus further extending water shortages in
Mogadishu, and that operation and maintenance may be inadequate. To reduce
these risks the Project provides for: (a) strengthening MWA through the
appointment of counterpart financial and technical advisors, (b) the creation
of a Project Management and Planning Unit, (c) an extensive training program
to improve MWA's operating and maintenance performance, and (d) hydrogeolog-
ists and drilling superintendents to assist in the planning and construction
of Project wells.
6.13      Project risks have been minimized to the extent feasible through
the above measures. To monitor the progress of the Project, MWA will provide
periodic progress reports during Project implementation, and will prepare a
Completion Report upon Project completion.

Incremental Costs and Return on Investment
Assumptions
1.        The following assumptions were used in calculating AIC and ROI:
(a) Constant prices (as of mid-1978) were used throughout;
(b) The effesctive service life of the Project's physical plant was
estimatesd at 20 years beginning with the year 1980;
(c) Annual costs include capital costs (reflecting physical con-
tingencies) and recurring costs exclusive of taxes and duties;
(d) Capital costs consist of a portion of Project costs only (those
componenits of costs related to the preparation and engineering
design of the Phase II project, a portion of the training program,
and tar:iff studies were excluded from consideration);
(e)  Annual maintenance expense has been estimated to equal 1X of cumu-
lative capital costs of the physical works portion of Project
costs;
(f) Annual operational expense consists of the costs of pumping (fuel
and l1bricants), purchase of chemicals, and other operating costs
per m produced as shown below:
Pumping cost               So.Sh. 0.207
Cost of chemicals          So.Sh. 0.014
Other operating costs      So.Sh. 0.087
(g)  Shadow pricing was based upon the application of a factor of 1.43 to
foreign cost components of capital cost and operational expense.

VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Government
relative to the following principal points:
(a) Before extending the activities of MWA to include other
than water supply services, Government shall inform the
Association of the effects such extension is likely to
have upon MWA and shall afford the Association the oppor-
tunity to comment thereon (para. 2.17);
(b) Consultants would be employed to prepare and assist
MWA in carrying out promptly a training program agreed
with the Association (paras. 2.21 and 2.23);
(c) MWA will enforce a limitation on new private water
supply connections (para. 3.07);
(d) MWA will not reduce its tariff below the current level
and will employ consultants to recommend such changes to
MWA's tariff level and structure as considered necessary
(para. 5.05).
7.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed Credit are that:
(a) Experts having experience, qualifications, duties and
responsibilities acceptable to the Association are
appointed to the positions of Technical Operations
Advisor and Financial Advisor (para. 2.08);
(b) A duly qualified, competent and experienced person will
be appointed as head of the Project Management and
Planning Unit (para. 2.09);
(c) a subsidiary loan agreement covering the relending by
Government to MWA of the proposed IDA Credit has been
executed (para. 5.08).
7.03      Subject to the foregoing, the Project is suitable for an IDA Credit
of US$6 million equivalent.
