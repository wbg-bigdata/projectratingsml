MEMORANDUM AND R9COMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTIRNATIONAL BANK FOR RZCONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPIENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO PETROLEO BRAILESIRO S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL
FOR A HYDROCARSON =RANSPORT AND PROCESSING PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (PETROBRAS), the national oil company, with the
guarantee of the Federative Republic of Brazil. for US$260 million equivalent is
submitted for approval.  The proposed loan would have a term of 15 years,
including five years grace, at the standard variable interest rate, and would
help to: (a) expand natural gas distribution to Sao Paulo; (b) economize on
liquid product distribution; (c) improve the efficiency of product processing;
and (d) reduce safety risks and environmental costs.
2.          The Federal Government, as part of its broader structural reform
strategy, has begun the process of reforming the hydrocarbons sector. Three
elements of this process are worth noting. First, the operations of PETROBRAS
in peripheral areas such as petrochemicals, fertilizer, minerals and trading are
being privatized or closed down (para. 7). Second, pricing reforms have been
initiated--including steps toward the (i) ending of subsidization of naphtha (the
major feedstock for petrochemicals) (para. 9), and (ii) economic pricing of
natural gas (para. 11). Third, PETROBRAS has been chosen as the first state
enterprise to sign an annual *contract management" agreement with the Government,
which defines the responsibilities of each part to the other (para. 12).
3.          Of course, more remains to be done, especially in two areas--pricing
and competition. For the former, a critical element is the calculation of
economic costs through the development of a new costing system at PETROBRAS
(para. 11), so that this data can be fully incorporated into Government pricing
decisions.  Entry of new competitors in the sector will be more difficult to
achieve because of constitutional limitations (para. 6).  However, President
Collor is publicly committed to seeking the end of monopoly rights for PETROBRAS
when the Constitution comes up for revision in 1993. For further progress with
the policy dialogue, a direct relationship with PETROBRAS is essential; and this
loan will accomplish that objective.
4.          iackarcnu.  Despite its substantial energy resources, increasing
energy demand had made Brazil by the 19705 the largest net importer of petroleum
among developing countries. The high level of international petroleum prices in
the 1970s and early 1980s led to a national strategy of increased energy self-
sufficiency, primarily via the development of petroleum, hydroelectric and
alcohol (from sugar cane) resources. By 1987, only 47% of the petroleum consumed
was imported, compared with 85% in 1979.
5.          The increased domestic supply of petroleum, hydroelectricity and
alcohol required high levels of public expenditures. By the early 1980s, the
energy sector absorbed more than one-fifth of all investments in Brazil and over
4% of CDP. Energy investments declined thereafter, as demand growth and resource
availability fell.

6.          PUTRtODM  is a public enterprise under the Ministry of Infrastructure
with a majority of shares owned by the Federal Government. It exercises the
monopoly reserved to the Federal Government under of the 1988 Constitution for
(a) the eploration, production and refining of petroleum productsl (b) shipping
of domestic petroleum and pipeline transport of natural gas, oil and basic
petroleum productal and (a) import and export of hydrocarbons. But while the
Constitution bans new wrisk contracts* for exploratlon, ufarm-Lnsw are permitted
on exletlng acreage. PETROBRAS also has over 35% of the competLtive domestlc
retaLl morket for petroleum products, and operates internationally under
competitive condLtions.
7.          P3TBDSRAS has also domlnated production of fertliLzer and upstream
petrochemLcals  (hydrocrackers)  througe  lts  subsldlarles,  PETROFERTIL  and
PETROQUI8A. As part of the Government privatizatLon program, these operatLons
are to be sold to the prlvate sector over the next few years. This will Lncrease
competltlon ln those areas, and leave PUTRODRAS free to concentrate on lts main
line of busines. Consultant teams are already examlning how the fiLst of these
entorprises shall be sold. PETROBRAS' commodity tradLng subsidiary has already
been closed down.
8.          PBTROMRAS has been a rare publlc success story ln Latin Amerlca. It
Ls about 34% private sector owned. It has relatively wide management autonomy
and a strong commercial orientation. As a consequence, desplte havlng monopoly
in several areas, lt is efficlent and technologically advanced, and has
successful lnternational operations. PESROBRAS has been flnanclally sound and
has largely self-financed lts investment program. Annual Lnvestments were
uS$3 - 4 billion in the early 1980s, but have fallen to an average of USS1.9
billion durlng the past three years due to macroeconomLc deterioration and lower
profits. Unlike most other state-owned enterprises, PETROBRAS has regularly been
transferring slgnlfLiant funds (US$1.3 - 2.7 bllion per annum) to the Federal
Government.
9.          Federal guidellnes require regular adjustments of retail prlces of
petroleum products to (a) reflect the cost of importst (b) offset LnflatLon; and
(c) provide mlnimum rates of return on investment. The Department of Combustible
Fuels (DNC) recommends (to the Mlnistry of Economy) prLce changes based on
PBTMRmRA8  cost-of-servlce submisLsons  At present, the average domestLc prlie
of a composLte barrel of oil products slLghtly exceeds the border parity
equivalent, due to the hlgh price of gasoline.  DLesel is prLced near lts
economlc tost, whlle the excess revenues from gasoline cross-subsidize the use
of llquld petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene, whlch are prlced below cost because
of their role in the budget of low Lncome familles.  These relatlve-prlce
distortLons have caused some undesirable lnter-fuel substLtutLon (e.g., dLesel
and LPG for gasolLne). In addltlon, the economlc cost of the alcohol program,
whlch substltutes for petroleum ln about half of BrazilLan made automoblIes, is
partLcularly high (about US$1.7 billlon/yr).
10.         For natural gas, wholesale priLes  from PETROSRAB remaLn the
responslbillty of the Federal Government, whlch has confLrmed lts intention to
pursue  economic  prLeLng  prLnclples.    The  Constltutlon  transferred  the
responsibility for retall gas prLcing to the Statesg progress is being made
toward ettlng retall gas prlces on the basis of long-run marginal cost (LRMC)
under the Sao Paulo Natural Gas Dlitrlbutlon Project (Loan No. 3043-BR).

11.         To provide a sounder and more transparent basi  for its pricing
submissions with respect to petroleum products and natural gas and for its
investment and operating programs, PETROBRAS is upgrading its costing system to
introduce economic concepts to complement financLal Lnformation. The system will
determine costs by product and location, and enable PETROMAES to create internal
profit centers. The new sstem is being implemented in stages, and will be
completed by the end of CY 1993.
12*          To improve coordination between macroeconomic policy and specific
policies of the state-owned firms, the Government is experimenting with the
concept of "contract management" on a yearly basis. In May 1991, PETROBRAS
became the first organization to draft such a contract with the Government. The
contract would comprise commitments in terms of financial and production targets
as well as agreement on the rules for price adjustments.   However,  the
effectiveness of the "contract management' approach has yet to be tested in
Brazil.
13.         Rationale for Rank Involvement* The Bank strategy ln Brazll has been
to support policies and investments that encourage economic growth and social
development in the context of macroeconomic stability.  The emphasis is on
efficient natural resource use and resource allocation, improved public sector
management, and appropriate targeting and delivery of support to the poor. The
energy sector is a key element in this strategyt a secure and efficient supply
of energy is indispensable to economic growth and social welfare.   Bank
involvement  promotes  efficiency  through  pricing  reforms,  international
competitive bidding, independent review of institutional, financial and technical
issues, and emphasis on environmental and conservation mcvsures.
14.         The sank has analyzed pricing and investment issues in the energy
sector in the Energy Strategy and Issues study (3818, to be issued in September
1991). At the same time, Brazil is completing work on an Energy Matrix, which
will identify the implications of alternative policies on the long-term supply
of and demand for different final energy sources. These two documents will
provide the underpinning for a broad sector dialogue.
15.         The Bank has lent some US$4.0 billions since 1949 to the Brazilian
electric power sector. However, due to issues concerning nuclear power and
electricity pricing, no loans were made in the period 1987-1989.  Furthermore,
the Electricity Transmission and Conservation Loan (3227-BR), approved on June
14, 1990, has not yet been signed because of lack of progress towards meeting the
average tariff level which is a condition of effectiveness.
16.         There has been only one loan for hydrocarbons, the Sao Paulo Natural
Gas Distribution Project  in 1988.   This operation, which  is proceeding
satisfactorily, permitted the Bank to begin playing a role in the development
of natural gas, and to broaden lts involvement in general energy sector policy,
including pricing, planning and implementation issues. As a basis for further
progress in the policy dialogue, a direct relationship with PETROBMS, the key
entity in the hydrocarbon subsector, would be established by the proposed loan.
17.         Proieat Obiectives:  The project aims to: (a) enhance natural gas
utilization as a substitute for other forms of energy with higher economic and
environmental costsl (b) reduce the distribution costs of petroleum products by



- 4 -
substituting pipelines for road and water transport; (c) reduce petroleum product
losses through processing optimixation; and (d) reduce environmental costs and
safety risks in petroleum product transport and refining. These are some of the
highest-priority issues identified by the 388.
18.         Progict Decriction:  The Transport Component consists ofs (a) one
gas pipeline to expand deliveries to Sao Paulo and three multi-purpose liquid
product pipelines to economize on deliveries from refineries to distribution
centers (55% of project cost); and (b) engineering design, environmental impact
studies, and training in pipeline operation and transport planning (3% of project
cost). The Processing Component containss (a) a hydrotreatment plant at the
Presidente 8ernardes Refinery at Cubatao (RP8C) to upgrade the quality of
petroleum products, reduce product losses and improve energy efficiency (39% of
project  cost)l  (b)  a  safety/industrial  training  program,   including:
(i) comprehensive risk evaluation at the RPBC, and an in-door air pollution
evaluation study; (ii) training in risk assessment and hazardous material and
waste  handling;  and  (iii)  procurement  of  air  pollution  control  mobile
laboratories for refineries (about 1% of project cost); and (c) an automation
(AGO) program consisting of studies (on optimization of processing and
centralized control for loading, storage and offsite facilities) and action
programs in three refineries based on these studies (2% of project cost).
19.         The project would be implemented over four years.  For the pipeline
construction, detailed designs will be done by local consultants. Contractors
will do the pipeline construction plans, profile and commissioning. For the
hydrotreatment unit, engineering will be done largely by PETROBRAS.  This
component will be implemented by a full-time PETROBRAS task force, with
production scheduled by mid-1994.   The automation and industrial safety
components will be developed and implemented with consultants' assistance. The
Financial Services Division will coordinate implementation of the various project
components. These arrangements are satisfactory.
20.         Total project financing requirements are estimated at US$623 million
equivalent, with a foreign excnange component of US$317 million (S1). Advance
contracting of US$60 million has been undertaken by PETROBRAS for urgently needed
project components with long procurement lead times. Retroactive financing of
up to US$25.0 million would be provided for project components implemented since
September 1, 1990. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement
schedule, are in Schedule B. The timetable of key project processing events and
the status of Bank Group operations in Brazil are in Schedules C and D,
respectively. One map, and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 8767-BR dated, June 6,
1991, are also attached.
21.         Actions Aareeds PETROBRAS has agreed to put the costing system now
being developed (see para. 9) into effect by December 31, 1993, and to exchange
views with the Bank on its implementation and application. The Government also
agreed to exchange views from time to time with the Bank and PETROBRAS on the
implementation and technical application of the new costing system. In addition,
PSTROBRAS has agreed tot (a) incur no long-term debt without Bank agreement if:
(i) a reasonable financial forecast shows an annual debt-service coverage ratio
of less than 1.4 times, or (ii) after the incurrance of such debt, the ratio of
debt to equity would be greater than 40 to 60; (b) maintain a current ratio of



not less than 0. 8 and produce funds from interna;. sources eqpivalent to not l-es
than 30% of capital expenditures in 1991, rising year by year to 45% in 1995t (O)
establish and maintain a Risk Assessment Unit and make its best efforts to carry
out the industrial safety programs agreed with the Bank; and (d) complete tho
automation (ACO) diagnostic study by December 31, 1991 and execute the pilot
projects by December 31, 1993 if recoamended by the diagnostic study. Prior to
disbursement, for the relevant project components, the Baik will (a) receive
evidence of timely availability of natural gas for the Santos to Sao Paulo
pipeline from the Merluza field; (b) review and approve the environmental impact
stat e  nts (RIMAs) related to two pipelines (REPAR to Joinville and RELAM to
Itaipu); and (c) receive evidence of formal approval by the appropriate
environmental authorities of the RIMAs.
22.         Proiect Benefitgs: The quantifiable beneflts are expected to generate
an economic rate of return (ERR) of about 21% for the Transport component, and
23% for the Processing component. In addition, pipeline transport of hydrocarbon
products is environmentally superior to the current truck and marine transport,
an vehicular emissions and the risk of traffic accidents that release hazardous
materials will be eliminated. The hydrotreatment unit will reduce the sulphur
content of diesel and fuel oil produced at RPBC. The use of natural gas, mainly
as a replacement for fuel oil, will also reduce air pollution.
23.         Proiect Risks: There are no serious technical risks associated with
the project. From the standpoint of gas reserves and deliverability, the project
carries minimal risk. The primary risk regarding the hydrotreatment plant is
related to sensitivity to international petroleum prices; however, analysis
confirmed the robustness of this component, even under relatively low
international petroleum prices (US$10/bbl).
24.         :egmndalons  I am satisfLed that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommnd that the gxecutive
Directors approve the proposed Loan.
