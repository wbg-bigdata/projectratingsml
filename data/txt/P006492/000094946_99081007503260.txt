BRAZIL
HYDROCARBON TRANSPORT AND PROCESSING PROJECT
(Loan 3376-BR)
PREFACE
I.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Hydrocarbon Transport and
Processing Project (Loan No. 3376-BR for US$260 million equivalent), approved by the Board
on June 26, 1991. The Borrower was Petr6leo Brasileiro S.A. (PETROBRAS), the Brazilian
Federal Government-owned oil company, and the Federative Republic of Brazil was the
guarantor. The loan was signed on October 26, 1992 and became effective on January 22, 1993.
2.    The loan will close on December 31, 1999, four years behind the original schedule. The
last disbursement took place on January 21, 1999 resulting in a total disbursement of $260.0
million. There was no undisbursed amount on the loan.
3.    The ICR was prepared by Mr. Luis H. Luzuriaga (consultant) under the supervision of
Mr. Luis M. Vaca-Soto (Task Manager, LCSFP) and with the assistance of Sati Achath
(LCSFP). It is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and Guarantee Agreements, the
Amendment to the Loan Agreement, Bank's supervision reports and Borrower's quarterly
reports. The Borrower reviewed the draft document and contributed with a summary evaluation
of the project. The ICR was reviewed by Mr. N. de Franco (Energy Team Leader for Brazil,
LCSFP), and Ms. Maria Victoria Lister (Quality Assurance Officer, LCSFP) and cleared by Mr.
J. A. Carvalho (Lawyer, LEGLA).

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
HYDROCARBON TRANSPORT AND PROCESSING PROJECT
(Loan 3376-BR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
Since 1949 the Bank was very active in supporting the development of the electric power
sector in Brazil, with over US$4.0 billion lent to support the activities of the sector. However,
there were only two loans to the hydrocarbon sector, the first one to finance a natural gas
distribution project in Sao Paulo and the second one, the Hydrocarbon Transport and Processing
Project, the subject of the present ICR. The first project played a significant role in the
restructuring of the natural gas sector at the State level, while the second project was
instrumental in the transformation of the energy sector at the national level. Indeed, the above
projects, together with the preparation of the Gas Sector Development Project, were the vehicles
to carry out a meaningful dialogue with the Government of Brazil on sector policy issues,
including the legal framework and the structure of the sector.
Project Objectives
The objectives of the Hydrocarbon Transport and Processing Project were to: (a) enhance
natural gas utilization as a substitute for other sources of energy with higher economic and
environmental costs; (b) reduce the distribution costs of petroleum products by substituting
pipelines for road and water transport; (c) reduce petroleum product losses through processing
optimization; (d) reduce environmental costs and safety risks in petroleum product transport and
refining; and: (e) support the Government of Brazil through the Ministry of Mines and Energy on
the reform and regulatory activities in the energy sector.
To meet the above objectives, the project's main components included: (a) a Transport
(Component consisting of a gas pipeline and three pipelines to deliver fuel products more
economically to distribution centers; (b) a Processing Component consisting of a Hydrogen
Treatment Plant to increase efficiency and productivity, automation of facilities at three
refineries to improve operating efficiency and reduce operating risks, and an industrial safety and
environmental component; and (c) an Energjy Sector Structural Reform Component that included
support for the reform of the hydrocarbon and electric power sectors, consisting of costing,
pricing, regulatory, organization and planning studies, as well as training programs.



Implementation Experience and Results
The physical components of the project were completed satisfactorily. The Technical
Assistance (TA) for the energy sector, dealing with the structure, legislation and regulation of the
hydrocarbon and electric power sectors, will be completed by the end of 1999. A final
evaluation of the TA component will be completed after the project's closing date and
incorporated as a complementary note to this ICR. The project assisted PETROBRAS to: (a)
install 42 km of gas pipeline and 767 km of oil products pipelines and related facilities; (b) build
a hydrogen treatment plant; (c) perform studies for the automation of operations of five
refineries; and (d) establish risk management and training programs to improve efficiency of
operations. The Technical Assistance component of the project provided significant guidance to
the Ministry of Mines and Energy to make decisions on the structure and regulation of the
hydrocarbon and electric power sectors.
Due to an initial delay of the Congress to approve the loan and coordination difficulties
within PETROBRAS, execution of the project was delayed and completion of the physical
facilities lagged by about two years. When the Government of Brazil requested technical
assistance for the reform of the energy sector, the Bank agreed to include a new component in
the project. The execution of the related studies demanded additional time. Due to these
reasons, the closing of the loan was extended by four years.
Project Sustainability
It is likely that the overall achievements of the project will be sustainable. The pipelines
and related facilities constructed under the Transport Component will provide efficient means of
transportation of fuel products by lowering the transport cost as compared to road, sea and fluvial
alternatives, reducing congestion of roads and ports and lowering the risk of accidental spills and
contamination. The natural gas delivered by the pipeline to Sao Paulo will keep substituting
more expensive and contaminant fuels.
The Technical Assistance Component is assisting the Government to introduce changes to
the hydrocarbon and the electric power sectors, with the purpose of opening up the energy
markets to competition by private companies while concomitantly protecting the consumers.
The restructuring of both sectors is likely sustainable because it is being supported by
comprehensive legislation and regulation, while private capital investments are increasing.
Bank Performance
The Bank provided effective advice to the Government of Brazil and PETROBRAS
during identification of the project, through the execution of an energy strategy study, which
provided the basis for the design of the project. Appraisal, negotiations and supervision were
adequate. The Bank provided guidance to PETROBRAS to resolve the coordination and
reporting problems present at the beginning of project execution. The Bank was flexible to
accept re-programming of activities and re-scheduling of the closing date to resolve the initial
delays of the project, and the Government's request to finance, with unused funds from the loan,
a Technical Assistance program for the energy sector.



iv
Performance of the Borrower
Performance of the Borrower was satisfactory during the preparation and appraisal of the
project and it provided the required information for project definition. There were problems of
coordination and implementation during the first three years of the project. However, once
procurement and internal coordination of the Borrower were resolved and implementation got
underway, the regional branches of the Borrower implemented the project efficiently and
provided the information required for project monitoring and supervision.
During the period of project execution, PETROBRAS was restructured to increase the
efficiency and effectiveness of its operations, which followed international trends. The
performance of the Secretariat of Energy, as one of the executing agencies for the Technical
Assistance component, has also been satisfactory, including coordination with the Bank on the
preparation of work programs, drafting of terms of reference for studies and hiring of
consultants.
Assessment of Outcome
The overall outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory, as all major physical
objectives have been achieved and are likely to be permanent. The alternative means of
transportation provided by the pipelines eased the pressure on roads and ports and helped to
reduce the cost of fuels. The installation of a Hydrotreatment Plant helped to reduce the import
of low sulfur diesel oil and improved the environmental performance of the refinery. The
automation of several refineries improved efficiency and reduced operational risks. The
implementation of studies and training of personnel improved the performance of the
hydrocarbon sector in general. The studies under the Technical Assistance component, together
with the preparation of the Gas Sector Development Project (Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline), have
supported the Government's decisions to reform the hydrocarbon and the electric power sectors.
Summary of Key Findings and Lessons Learned
The key findings are: (a) the planned execution schedule of the project was too optimistic
and did not foresee the delays in the Congressional approval, the difficulties in the coordination
of project activities within PETROBRAS, nor the need for the Borrower to adapt its
procurement process to Bank standard procurement guidelines. These issues caused a delay of
about two years in project execution and early difficulties in monitoring and reporting the
project's progress; and (b) despite initial delays and difficulties, an experienced and strong
company, such as PETROBRAS, can satisfactorily complete a complex project in a priority
operational area when it is motivated by either the potential benefits of the project or by the
potential for overall improvement in the efficiency of its operations.
The main lessons learned from the project are: (i) when preparing the schedule for
execution of a project, the time for congressional approval, if required, should be considered; (ii)
to avoid execution delays due to procurement processing, during appraisal a complete analysis
should be made of the internal procedures and procurement practices of the borrower, especially



v
when it is a large corporation with well established practices and procedures, in order to
coordinate them with Bank's procurement guidelines; (iii) as energy sector reforms take usually
longer than expected, the Bank should be ready to extend closing dates beyond the usual terms if
the benefits of the continued dialogue with the authorities override the administrative costs of
keeping the loan open; and (iv) the increasing availability of project-related information in the
Bank's Internet pages is highly improving the interface between the Bank and its clients.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
HIYDROCARBON TRANSPORT AND PROCESSING PROJECT
(Loan 3376-BR)
PART I - PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Introduction
1.    This report evaluates the implementation of the Hydrocarbon Transport and Processing
Project, which was financed by a Bank loan of US$260 million, approved on June 26, 1991. The
Borrower was the Federal Government-owned company PETROBRAS and the guarantor was
the Federative Republic of Brazil. The Hydrocarbon Transport and Processing Project permitted
the Bank to play a significant role in the optimization of operations of the hydrocarbon industry.
More importantly, the project opened up a dialogue with the Government of Brazil on key sector
policy issues and on the reform of its legal framework and organization.
B. Statement and Evaluation of Objectives
2.    Project Objectives. The original objectives of the project were to: (a) enhance natural
gas utilization as a substitute for other sources of energy with higher economic and
environmental costs; (b) reduce the distribution costs of petroleum products by substituting
pipelines for road and water transport; (c) reduce petroleum product losses through processing
optimization; and (d) reduce environmental costs and safety risks in petroleum product transport
and refining.
3.    The loan amendment signed on October 4, 1996 added a fifth objective to the project: (e)
support the Government of Brazil through the Ministry of Mines and Energy on the reform and
regulatory activities in the energy sector.
4.    To meet the above objectives, the project's components included:
* Transport Component consisting of: (a) a pipeline and related facilities to deliver natural gas
to Sao Paulo; (b) three pipelines with storage tank and pump stations, to deliver liquid fuel
products more economically to distribution centers; (c) engineering design, environmental
impact studies and training in pipeline operations and transport planning.
* Processing ('omponent consisting of: (a) a Hydrogen Treatment Plant at the Cubatao refinery
to increase productivity, upgrade the quality of petroleum products and reduce product
losses; (b) automation studies focusing on optimization of process and centralized control of
loading, storage and offsite facilities and, on the basis of theses studies, execute an action
program for three refineries; (c) an industrial safety and environmental program including: (i)
development of norms for risk assessment, hazardous waste handling and relevant training;
(ii) comprehensive risk evaluation at the Cubatao refinery; (iii) acquisition of air quality



2
monitoring mobile laboratories; and (iv) training to help institutionalize safety and
environmental awareness.
Energy Sector Structural Reform ('omponent: This third component, which was added by the
October 4, 1996 loan amendment, included: (a) support for the reform of the hydrocarbon
sector, consisting of: (i) hydrocarbon costing and pricing studies, (ii) regulatory, organization
and planning studies for the Brazilian oil and natural gas sectors, and (iii) training programs,
hiring of consultants and acquisition of related equipment and materials; and (b) support for
the reform of the electric power sector, consisting of: (i) electricity costing and pricing
studies, (ii) regulatory, organization and planning studies for the Brazilian electric power
sector, and (iii) training programs, hiring of consultants and acquisition of related equipment
and materials
5.    Evaluation of Objectives. The project's objectives were based on the priorities of the
Government of Brazil, which were confirmed by the Bank through the "Brazil: Energy Strategy
and Issues Study", prepared by LAC through the Energy and Industry Division I and published
in May 1990. The project was designed to address high priority issues, including substitution of
gas for other less efficient fuels, efficiency improvements in the supply of fuels, improvements
of the environmental conditions related with the supply of fuels, and setting efficient pricing
policies. The project was also designed with the purpose of promoting the Bank's dialogue with
the Government of Brazil on overall energy sector policies. In this respect, the loan amendment
of 1996 further supported the Government's objective of reform of structural and pricing policies
of the hydrocarbon and electric power sectors.
C. Achievement of Objectives
6.    Implementation Record. The project was appraised in August 1990 and was approved
by the Executive Board on June 22, 1991. The loan was signed on October 26, 1992 and became
effective on January 22, 1993. The original loan closing date was December 31, 1995 and it was
extended to December 31, 1997 and then to December 31, 1998 due to project execution delays
and then for a third time to December 31, 1999 to allow additional time required to implement
the reforms of the energy and electric power sectors.
7.    Project Cost and Financing. Actual project cost amounted to US$592 million,
compared to US$623.9 estimated at appraisal. The actual cost included US$ 20.5 million
invested in the Technical Assistance to the hydrocarbon and electric power sectors, which was
not a part of the original scope of the SAR. The Bank financed US$260.0 million and the
Borrower financed US$332 million from its own resources.
8.    Execution of Physical Project Components. The project was executed as follows:
*  Transport Component. By the third quarter of 1996 the following pipelines under this
component were completed and in full operation: (i) the Santos-Sao Paulo (GASAN) gas
pipeline, 153 km long and 12" diameter, 1.5 million m3/day capacity; (ii) the Guararema-
Replan (OSPLAN II) petroleum products pipeline, 153 km long and 18" diameter, 23,000
m3/day capacity; (iii) the Repar-Florian6polis (OPASC) petroleum pipeline, 253 km, 10" and



3
8" diameter, 6,400 m3/day capacity and (iv) the Temadre-Jequie-Itabuna (ORSUB) products
pipeline, 361 km long, 10" and 8" diameter, 4,500 m3/day capacity. The pipeline
construction included related components such as pumping stations, storage tanks, truck
loading facilities, etc. The program to enhance transport planning capacity and training for
pipeline staff was completed through the execution of II studies and training modules.
Processing (omponent. (i) The hydrogen desulphurization and treatment facility
(Hydrotreatment plant or HDT), designed to increase production of low sulphur diesel oil and
reduce product losses was installed and was fully operational by December 1997. The
capacity of the plant is 5,000 m3/day. (ii) The studies for the automation program of oil
refineries or ACO were completed and PETROBRAS implemented the recommendations in
five refineries (REFAP, REDUC, RLAM, RPBC and REGAP). (iii) The industrial safety
and environmental program was completed. It included a risk analysis of the Cubatao oil
refinery, an evaluation of odor emissions at the same refinery, the installation of an emissions
mobile testing station and the implementation of recommendations and training of operating
personnel. As a result, the environmental conditions in the surrounding areas of the Cubatao
refinery improved to acceptable levels and PETROBRAS' technical and operating personnel
were trained to extend similar improvements to other refineries in Brazil.
9.    Execution of the Energy Sector Structural Reform Component The Technical
Assistance component supported the execution of studies financed by the loan, which directly or
indirectly were instrumental for reforms of the energy sector. The details of these reforms are as
follows:
* Hydrocarbon Sector: In November 1995 the Congress approved a constitutional amendment
to abolish the monopoly of the hydrocarbons sector by PETROBRAS. On August 1997, the
Hydrocarbon Law was enacted, which effectively ended the monopoly by PETROBRAS,
provided open access to other investors and created the National Council of Energy Policy
("Conselho Nacional de Politica Energetica" or CNPE) and the Hydrocarbon Regulatory
Agency ("Agencia Nacional do Petr6leo" or ANP). The ANP was established in January
1998, with the responsibility of overseeing the process of opening up of Brazil's petroleum
and gas industries to other domestic and foreign players. Progress has been made in fuel
price deregulation, including the freeing of downstream distribution of gasoline, alcohol and
LPG. Until the end of 1999, consultants financed by the project will provide advice to the
Government on further sector improvements, including: norms for the taxation of the
hydrocarbon industry, norms for the open access to the national gas pipeline network, norms
for the exploration and production of gas and oil fields, satellite integrated system for the
detection of oil spills on the ocean and an environmental and socio-economic study for the
Bacia de Campos oilfield.
*  Electric Power Sector: The Law of Public Services approved by Congress in February 1995
established a new regime for awarding concessions for public services, allowing the intensive
participation of private sector in power, transport, telecommunications and water. The Law
ofElectricity Services issued on July 1995, defined the role to be played by public and
private investors in the supply of electricity services, and allowed large consumers to contract
electric supply directly from power generators. Law No. 9648 of May 1998 mandated the



4
unbundling of all of ELETROBRAS regional subsidiaries into one or more generating and
transmission companies. This law also established an Independent System Operator (ISO),
responsible for dispatch, supervision and control of both generation and transmission
facilities, and created awholesale power market. The National Agency of Electric Energy
("Agendia Nacional de Energia E1ltrica" or ANEEL) was established in December 1996, and
since then a drastic reform of the power sector is being implemented by the Brazilian
government, allowing the participation of the private sector in all activities of the sector,
including generation, transmission and distribution. In the last three years, 12 distribution
companies, representing 47% of the market, and one generation company were privatized. In
addition, the Technical Assistance program financed by the loan continues to provide the
advice of consultants to furwther examine options for the structure of the power sector and for
the redefinition of the role of ELETROBRAS in the sector.
10.   The project accomplished its objectives substantially, as (i) the natural gas transportation
component was completed as planned and natural gas utilization increased, substituting other
sources of energy with higher economic and environmental costs; (ii) the distribution costs of
petroleum products were reduced as the new pipelines provided an efficient and low cost
transportation altemnative to road and water transport; the construction of the HDT plant helped
to reduce petroleum losses through processing optimization and increased the national
production of low sulphur diesel oil; (iii) the training provided to pipeline staff and the corrective
measures on pipeline operation reduced environmental costs and safety risks in product
transportation and refining; and (iv) the technical assistance provided by the project, together
with the preparation of the Gas Sector Development Project, was instrumental for the
implementation of reforms in the electric power and hydrocarbon sectors.
ii.   PETROBRAS complied with the financial covenants, with the exception of the current
ratio, which in several years was below the covenanted value. This lack of compliance was due
to the existence of large amount of accounts receivable from the central Government, and the
decision of the extemnal auditor not to include such debts as receivable. At the start of the
project, the external auditors had difficulties in auditing the project accounts, due to the
difficulties in collecting project information under the decentralized project implementation
system of PETROBRAS. This issue was resolved after internal procedures were adapted to the
project monitoring needs. The overall financial situation of PETROBRAS remained strong
throughout the period of execution of the project, as shown in the following table:

12.   The current Internal Economic Rate of Return (IERR) for the physical components of the
project was calculated following the same methodology of the SAR. The costs include the actual
capital investment, less taxes, duties and subsidies, plus operational costs. Benefits for the
petroleum product pipelines are the net savings due to the lower cost of transportation by
pipeline than by road or barge. Benefits for the Santos-Sao Paulo gas pipeline are the savings
due to the substitution of high cost fuels by low cost natural gas. Benefits for the hydrogen
treatment plant include the increased production of low sulfur diesel oil, instead of high sulfur
fuel oil, which is a fuel of lower economic value and higher negative environmental impact. The
following table shows the IERR as calculated at appraisal and the values calculated for the

D. Major Factors Affecting the Project
13.   The delay of congressional approval of the Loan Agreement required under Brazilian law
caused initial delays of about 18 months in the execution of the project.
14.   Another factor that affected the project was that the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU)
required under the loan agreement had difficulties in establishing a monitoring and information
system under the complex and decentralized organization of PETROBRAS during the first years
of project execution. This situation caused problems for the procurement of works and services,
as PETROBRAS' regional branches were accustomed to internal procedures that were often in
conflict with Bank guidelines. Eventually, PETROBRAS made the changes and adaptations
required to facilitate procurement and created ad-hoc methods for retrieving accounting
information as required for the project.
15.   The national economic stabilization plan of 1995 affected the project, because of the
changes in methods of price adjustment for inflation. Some of PETROBRAS' contractors
declared bankruptcy or decided to rescind their contract, which was legally permitted by law.
This caused additional delays in the execution of the project, but did not affect the overall project
cost.
16.   The Technical Assistance for the hydrocarbon sector had an initial delay, due to the
difficulties in selecting an agency to provide administrative and technical support to the
Secretariat of Mines and Metallurgy of the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME). After the



6
responsibilities for these studies were transferred to ANP, a satisfactory agreement was reached
with ELETROBRAS and is to be signed soon.
E. Project Sustainability
17.   It is likely that the overall achievements of the project will be sustainable. The pipelines
and related facilities constructed under the Transport Component will provide an efficient means
of transportation of fuel products, thereby lowering the transport cost as compared to road, sea
and fluvial alternatives, reducing congestion of roads and lowering the risk of accidental spills
and contamination. The natural gas delivered by the pipeline to Sao Paulo will keep substituting
for more highly contaminant and expensive fuels. The Hydrotreatment Plant and the automation
of fuel refineries achieved under the Processing (omponent, has increased the production of low
sulfur diesel oil, increased the efficiency of oil refineries and reduced ambient contamination.
The Studies and Training programs executed under the above two components have assisted
PETROBRAS in the introduction of risk management programs and control of the efficiency of
operation of pipelines and refineries.
18.   The Technical Assistance Component is assisting the Government to introduce changes to
the hydrocarbon and the electric power sectors, with the purpose of opening up the energy
markets to competition by private companies and protecting the consumer. The restructuring of
both sectors is being carried out through legislation and regulation which is likely to be
sustainable through the times, especially considering that large private capitals are flowing into
the energy sector.
F. Bank Performance
19.   The Bank provided effective advice to the Government of Brazil and PETROBRAS
during identification of the project, through the execution of an energy strategy study, which
provided the basis for the design of the project. Appraisal, negotiations and supervision were
adequate.
20.   The Bank provided guidance to PETROBRAS to resolve the coordination and reporting
problems present at the beginning of project execution. The Bank was flexible to accept re-
programming of activities and rescheduling of the closing date to resolve the initial delays of the
project, and the Government's request to finance, with unused funds from the loan, a Technical
Assistance program for the energy sector.
G. Performance of the Borrower
21.   Performance of the Borrower was satisfactory during the preparation and appraisal of the
project and it provided the required information for project definition. There were problems of
internal coordination and implementation, mainly procurement, during the first three years of the
project. However, once procurement and internal coordination issues were solved by the
Borrower, the regional branches of the Borrower implemented the project efficiently and
provided the information required for project monitoring and supervision.



7
22.   During the first three years of project execution, the external auditors reported
discrepancies on the accounting of disbursements of the loan proceeds. The issue was resolved
when the Bank provided the Borrower with direct access via Internet to the Controller's
Department databank.
23.   During the period of project execution, PETROBRAS was restructured to increase the
efficiency and effectiveness of its operations, following international trends, as follows: (a) the
Financial Department was divided in two sectors, Finance and Controller, to reinforce the
communications with the capital market and the monitoring of the accounting function; (b) three
up-stream departments (Exploration, Drilling, and Production) were reunited in one: Exploration
and Production; and (c) three down-stream departments (Refining, Transportation, and
Commercial) were reunited in the Supply Department.
24.   The performance of the Secretariat of Energy of the MIME, as one of the executing
agencies for the Technical Assistance component, and ELETROBRAS, as the Government's
adviser, have also been satisfactory. Coordination with the Bank on the preparation of work
programs, drafting of terms of reference for studies and hiring of consultants was adequate. The
participation of ANP, as the implementing agency for the petroleum and natural gas sectors, has
started recently. A final evaluation of the TA component will be completed after the project's
closing date and incorporated as a complementary note to this ICR.
H. Performance of Consultants
25.   The performance of all consultants involved in the project is evaluated as satisfactory.
Consultants financed by the Bank are: (a) Automation Studies: Profimatics; (b) Simulation
Software Development for Pipeline Scheduling: ICON Interactive Computer Modeling; (c) Risk
Analysis: Entec UK Limited; and (d) Power Sector Reform: Coopers and Lybrand.
L. Assessment of Outcome
26.   The overall outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory, as all major physical
objectives have been achieved and are likely to be permanent. The alternative means of
transportation provided by the pipelines eased the pressure on roads and helped to reduce the
cost of fuels. The installation of a Hydrotreatment Plant helped to reduce the import of low
sulfur diesel oil and improved the environmental performance of the refinery. The automation of
several refineries improved efficiency and reduced operational risks. The implementation of
studies and training of personnel improved the performance of the hydrocarbon sector in general.
27.   The execution of studies under the Technical Assistance component, together with the
preparation of the Gas Sector Development Project (Bolivia-Brazil Gas Pipeline), resulted in
recommendations to the Government on the required legislation and regulations to restructure the
hydrocarbon and the electric power sectors.

J. Future Project Operation
28.   Through the period of project execution, PETROBRAS continued improving its capacity
for the operation of pipelines and refineries and strengthening the risk management of those
installations. Therefore, no problems are foreseen in the future operation of the project-financed
facilities.
K. Key Findings and Lessons Learned
29.   The main findings are:
*  The planned execution schedule of the project was too optimistic and did not foresee the
delays in the Congressional approval, the difficulties in the coordination of project activities
within PETROBRAS, nor the need for the Borrower to adapt its procurement process to
Bank standard procurement guidelines. These issues caused a delay of about two years in
project execution and early difficulties in monitoring and reporting the project's progress.
*  Despite initial delays and difficulties, an experienced and strong company, such as
PETROBRAS, can satisfactorily complete a complex project in a priority operational area
when it is motivated by either the potential benefits of the project or by the potential for
overall improvement in the efficiency of its operations.
30.   The main lessons learned from the project are:
*  When preparing the schedule for project execution, the time necessary for congressional
approval, if required, should be considered.
*  To avoid execution delays due to procurement processing, during appraisal a complete
analysis should be made of the internal procedures and procurement practices of the
borrower, especially when it is a large corporation with well established practices and
procedures, in order to coordinate them with Bank's procurement guidelines.
*  As energy sector reforms often take longer than expected, the Bank should be ready to extend
closing dates beyond the usual terms if the benefits of the continued dialogue with the
authorities override the administrative costs of keeping the loan open.
* The increasing availability of project-related information in the Bank's Internet pages is
highly improving the interface between the Bank and its clients. According to the experience
with PETROBRAS, increasing the information available will have a very positive effect in
the accuracy and timeliness of Borrower's reports to the Bank, like the Quarterly Progress
Reports.

Project Completion Report (PCR)
Introduction
The main objectives of the Project were: (a) to enhance natural gas utilization as a substitute
for other sources of energy with higher economic and environmental costs; (b) to reduce the
distribution costs of petroleum products by substituting pipelines for road and water
transport; (c) to reduce petroleum product losses through processing optimization; and (d) to
reduce environmental costs and safety risks in petroleum product transport and refining. The
Project was divided in two parts: a Transport Component and a Processing Component.
Both components were managed by PETROBRAS itself
In 1996 another objective was added: a Technical Assistance Component to support
reform and regulatory activities in the energy sector, under the direction of the Ministry of
Mines and Energy. The participation of PETR(-)BRAS in this component was to relend to
ELETROBRAS vii and to UNICAMP viii - parties of a separate agreement together with MME -
the proceeds of the loan allocated for such activities.
PROJECT ExEcuTION
The Transport Component - Part A - comprises the following:
(a) Santos - Sao Paulo Gas Pipeline - GASAN;
(b) Guararema - Replan Pipeline - OSPLAN-1I;
(c) Repar - Florian6polis Products Pipeline - OPASC;
(d) Temadre - Jequie - Itabuna Products Pipeline - ORSUIB;
(e) Transport Planning and Training - TPT.
The Processing Component - Part B - comprises the following:
(f) Hydrotreatment Plant - HDT;
(g) Industrial Safety Program - SEP;
(h) Automation Program - Aco.
All programs were executed in accordance with the specifications and put in operation
including OSPLAN-II pipeline, which was fully financed by PETROBRAS.
The TPT program and other training programs were completed. PETROBRAS has a permanent
training program; the IBRD financed training programs are only a very small portion of it.

PETROBRAS                                             Loan Agreement 3376-BR
Because the gathering of required documentation for follow-up and for draft support as per
IBRI) standards was very toilsome and different from PETR(:)BRAS standards, the
corresponding reports and financial performance were not completely fulfilled.  As a
consequence, the drafts of training programs fall short of estimates.
CONSULTANT PERFORMANCE
Aco program was made by a consultant: Profimatics, Inc. The study is of very high quality
since it has been applied into five of our refineries with success. Only the study was financed
by IBRI), not the implementation of its conclusion.
As part of TPT program, ICOM - Interacting Computer Modeling, Inc. - developed an
automatic scheduling system for pipeline. It is working properly.
As part of SEP program, ENTEC UK Ltd. developed a study to assess the risks associated to
RPBC refinery. The conclusions have been taken in consideration.
The work done by Coopers and Lybrand was under the exclusive supervision of
ELETRO )BRAS.
IBRD PERFORMANCE
IBPRI) assistance was very good in order to help PETROBRAS to comply with its requirements.
Some of them presented special difficulties:
* the difference between PETROBRAS procurement system and IBRD procurement
guidelines;
*  the difference between PETR(.)BRAS accounting system and SAR  budget breakdown
items of the programs.
PROJECT COST
One factor that strongly impacted Project cost: the acceleration of the inflation rate during the
first years (1992>1994: above 5000% a.a. in June.94) followed by a sudden decrease in the
last period (1995+1999: about 7% a.a. in 1999). Fluctuations in the exchange rate also
imposed a heavy burden by distorting the visibility of the work done.
Because of these two facts the Project's financial figures are of minor significance.
Nevertheless the total cost in American dollars - IBRD and PETROBRAS-financed components
- was less than the initial estimates.

FINAL REMARKS
It has been a great experience for PETR(:)BRAS to work with IBRD. The main advantage is to
profit from the IBRD sophisticated technology for project follow-up and control. The direct
access to the IBRD financial databank through Internet, allowed PETROBRAS to keep its
financial records updated without any time delay or deviation. We would suggest that the
IBRD steps forward and increase accessibility to other project-related databases to improve
the Bank-Borrower interface and facilitate preparation of Quarterly Progress Reports.
