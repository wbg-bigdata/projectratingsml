REPORT AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR
A SECOND LIVESTOCK PROJECT THROUGH THE
DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES
1.        I submit the Following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Philippines for an equivalent of $20.5 million.
The loan would have a term of 14-1/2 years, including 5-1/2 years of grace
and an interest rate of 8.5 percent per annum. $19.8 million of the proceeds
of the loan would be reLent to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)
on the same terms as those of the Bank loan for on-lending to specific live-
stock enterprises. The balance would be used by the Government to help
finance livestock research and a feed analysis laboratory.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The most recent Economic Report - "Current Economic Position and
Prospects of the Philippines" (No. 568-PH of November 7, 1974) was circu-
lated to the Executive D)irectors on November 11, 1974. A basic economic
mission visited the Philippines in April/May 1975 and is now finalizing
its report; the discussl'on below includes the findings of the mission.
Annex I of this report contains country economic data.
3.        During the 1900s, the economy grew in real terms at the rate of
5-6 percent per annum. However, the rate of growth was less than the level
that might have been achieved if the considerable natural and human resources
of the Philippines had been exploited more effectively. Moreover, the bene-
fits of growth were not distributed widely and unemployment rose. Low levels
of taxation resulted in inadequate public investment in necessary infrastruc-
ture and social services.   Relatively weak export performance, combined wi t'..
a failure to reduce the import dependence of domestic industry, resulted
in a steady deterioraticn in the balance of payments position.
4.        During '1970-72, the authorities adopted policies of monetary and
fiscal restraint in order to lay a firm basis for future growth. With
assistance from the Consultative Group, they succeeded in improving substan-
tially the maturity structure of the external public debt. Real GNP during
that period increased at about 5 percent a year. In 1972, following severe
floods, the President began a series of social and economic reforms in the
country including an agrarian reform program, tax reforms, and an adminis-
trative reorganization. These programs are beginning to show results.
1/   The paragraphs in this part, except for paragraphs 13 and 14 which
have been updated,are the same as those in the President's Report on
the Industrial Investment Credit Project (Report No. P-1726-PH) dated
December 3, 1975.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Dank authorization.



-2-
5.       'In 1973 there was a sharp increase in the level of economic acti-
vity in the Philippines. This upsurge was led by the international commodity
boom, which resulted in higher export incomes in the Philippines, a strong
recovery in agricultural and industrial production for the domestic market
and an expansion in public and private investment. The growth in real GNP
doubled to 10 percent.
6.       TLike most countries, the Philippines was profoundly affected by
the tumultuous events in the world economy that began with the jump in the
prices for food and petroleum in late 1973. With international trade the
equivalent of almost half of its GNP, the Philippines proved quite vulner-
able to the impact of world inflation, the increase in oil prices and the
prolonged recession in the industrialized countries. This sequence of
events has temporarily frustrated the Government's attempt to accelerate
the rate of development, and in 1974 GNP increased by only about 6 percent
in real terms. While adverse effects of the recession were cushioned some-
what in 1974 by a modest improvement in the external terms of trade, the
Philippines has been even more seriously affected in 1975 by the continued
rise in import prices and reduced demand for Philippine exports. The real
growth of GNP in 1975 is estimated to have been at about the 6 percent rate of
the previous year. Improvement in the growth performance in 1976 can be
expected only if recovery takes place in the economies of the Philippines'
main trading partners.
7.        Agricultural production has grown at an average rate of 3.2
percent per year during the 1970s, a period which has been affected by un-
usually adverse weather conditions. Rice production increased by 25 percent
in 1973-74, but due to serious damage by typhoons, it grew by only 1 percent
in 1974-75, and the Government had to import 200,000 tons in the first half
of 1975 to ensure adequate stocks. However, initial indications are that
the outlook for rice production in 1975-76 is bright. The Government is
giving the highest priority to increasing agricultural production and has
initiated a number of programs designed to expand the use of fertilizer,
irrigation and supervised credit. It has also intensified efforts to expand
social services needed in rural areas, including rural electrification,
health and family planning services as well as small-scale road and irri-
gation projects.
8.        Although progress has been slower than initially planned, the
Government has moved ahead with its agrarian reform program for the nation's
one million tenant farmers who grow rice and corn. By mid-1975, land trans-
fer certificates had been issued to nearly 200,000 tenants and progress had
been made on land valuations and the transfer of titles. The Government has
raised the cash portion of the compensation package to landlords to reduce
their resistance to land reform, but strong administrative efforts will be
necessary to ensure continued progress in the implementation of the program.
9.        Industry accounts for almost 30 percent of net domestic product,
one-third of total fixed investment and 15 percent of total employment.
Industrial production, which grew by 12 percent in 1973, was adversely



-3-
affected'in 1974 by the world-wide economic slowdown and grew by only 3.6
percent in 1975.   This decline is primarily a result'of depressed demand
for Philippine exports on the part of the country's main trading partners
and the concomitant slowdown in the rate of economic growth in the Philip-
pines. Nonetheless, the long-term prospects for industrial growth are
favorable because of the natural and human resource endowment of the Philip-
pines and a very active private sector.
10.       The Government has made significant progress in increasing public
investment. The ratio of public investment to GNP is currently about 3 per-
cent compared with 1.8 percent in FY72. The Government has also imple-
mented a series of long needed tax reforms and improvements in tax adminis-
tration. These reforms, aided by the increased economic activity, the boom
in export incomes, and domestic inflation, resulted in a 36 percent increase
in national government tax revenues in FY73, and an estimated 47 percent in
FY74. As a result, the ratio of national government tax revenues to GNP
has increased from an average of 9 percent in recent years to an estimated
12.3 percent in FY74.
11.       'In the latter part of 1973, inflation emerged as a major problem
in the Philippines and in 1974 consumer prices rose by almost 40 percent.
The rise was caused by the large increase in liquidity that came with the
export boom in 1973-74, and by a number of cost-push factors, including the
higher rate of world inflation. To deal with this problem, the Government
adopted contractionary monetary and fiscal policies, and attempted to
reduce the impact of inflation on consumers by subsidizing such essential
goods as wheat, imported rice, and cooking oil. As a consequence of the
Government's measures, the annual rate of inflation decreased to less than
20 percent at the end of 1974 and less than 10 percent in 1975.
12.       The rapid inflation in 1974 exacerbated the decline in real wages
which had begun in 1970. Overall, there was a decline of about 20 percent
in real wages during 1974. In order to offset the deterioration of real
wages in urban areas, thE Government increased the salaries of Government
employees and directed private firms to grant emergency cost of living ad-
justments to employees earning less than P 600 per month. Nevertheless
real urban wage incomes declined and reduced the demand for manufactured
products, which contributed to the poor performance of the manufacturing
sector in 1974. The depression in the urban areas was partly offset by the
improvement in rural incomes that stemmed from continued high prices for
agricultural commodities.
13.       On the external side, the Philippine balance of payments bene-
fitted considerably from the international commodity price boom during 1973.
High prices for the country's chief exports, including coconut products,
sugar, copper and wood products resulted in a 70 percent boost in export
earnings and a balance of payments surplus of about $670 million. Since
mid-1974 the external trade position has deteriorated, due to the sharp
increases in the prices of oil and other imports, less favorable prices
for Philippine exports, and reduced volume of some exports resulting from



the recession in the economies of the Philipines' main trading partners. As
a result, the overall balance of payments surplus fell to about $100 million
in 1974, and a deficit of about $400 million was recorded in 1975. Inter-
national reserves stood at about $1.1 billion at the end of 1975, the equiv-
alent of three months imports.
14.       The outlook for 1976 is for exports to increase by about 12 per-
cent in real terms on the assumption that there will be some international
economic recovery. Imports will need to grow by about 7 percent in real
terms in order to maintain the growth of the economy. Due to a modest de-
terioration of the terms of trade, the current account deficit may reach about
$1.0 billion compared to $860 million in 1974. Medium and long term capital
inflows are expected to finance most of this deficit, producing an overall
balance of payments deficit of about $200 million. Such a deficit can be
managed without serious pressure on reserves through utilization of IMF
oil facility and by short-term foreign borrowing by the Central Bank.
15.       The overall level of debt of the Philippines is expected to remain
within reasonable limits, as the ratio of debt service payments to exports
and non-factor services would average about 16-17 percent during the rest of
this decade. At present, the Bank/IDA share in total debt outstanding is
about 10 percent and its share in debt-service is about 4 percent. These
shares are expected to increase somewhat in the years ahead.
16.       Foreign assistance is expected to continue to be of major import-
ance in helping to finance the larger investment expenditures which will be
necessary for the country's development. In order to ensure that disbursement
of external assistance reaches levels commensurate with the level of develop-
ment expenditures which will be required during the latter part of the decade,
total commitments will need to be maintained in real terms at least at the
level of about $500 million which was achieved in 1974. The Consultative
Group for the Philippines at its meeting in Paris on October 1, 1975, agreed
that it would be reasonable for the Philippine Government to seek aid commit-
ments of about $600 million during 1976.
Growth Prospects
17.       Despite the slowdown in the growth of the economy which is primarily
a result of worldwide economic conditions, the Government remains committed
to regaining the growth momentum which began in 1973 to provide for a con-
tinued increase in incomes and employment. High priority must be accorded
to expanding employment opportunities - in the short-term as well as the
long-term - because unemployment and underemployment are still high, and the
labor force continues to grow at 3 percent a year.
18.       Priority must also be given to expanding food production for the
domestic market, to expanding industrial export production and to accelerating
development of local energy resources. The difficulties experienced during
the last two years in importing sufficient quantities of food at reasonable
prices, especially cereals, have increased the Government's resolve to



- 5 -
achieve self-sufficiency in rice and corn as soon as possible. The Govern-
ment rightly recognizes that the increased cost of petroleum and other
imports cannot be financed indefinitely by borrowing abroad, and it is active-
ly encouraging both local and foreign investors to expand the productive
capacity of export industries and to undertake major new import-replacing
investments. Because ii: will take time for these investments to have an
impact on the balance of- payments, the Government is seeking increased
support from the international financial community to help carry out its
development program and to ease the adjustment to higher petroleum and other
import prices. Because of the substantial easing of the external debt burden
which has taken place in the last several years, the Philippines now has the
capacity to borrow externally larger amounts of capital in support of its
development program.
19.       Given the likely availability of resources and the expected growth
in various sectors, it is reasonable for the Government to plan for a longer
term growth in GNP of about 7 percent a year in real terms. To achieve
this objective, increased investments will be needed in a wide range of in-
dustries. Public investments also need to be increased. A new public in-
frastructure program is being prepared, and the Government is putting emphasis
on developing nuclear and indigenous power sources and on irrigation, feeder
roads and other projects to support increased food production. The Government
has made considerable progress in recent years in building up the capacity of
public sector agencies to prepare and execute projects. However, there will
be a need for continued efforts to strengthen this aspect of administration.
The ratio of public investment to GNP will need to rise from the present level
of 3 percent to about 5 percent by 1980. To support the level of investment,
the Government will need to intensify its tax efforts so that the ratio of
national taxes to GNP rises from its present level of 11-12 percent to 14
percent by 1980.
20.       The Governmernt's ambitious development program will continue to
require foreign resources in addition to the capital which would become
available for the financing of the foreign exchange component of develop-
ment projects. Some financing of local costs is justified, especially for
projects of economic and social importance which need limited amounts of
foreign exchange.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES
21.       The Philippines has received 32 Bank loans and three IDA credits
totalling $791.2 million, net of cancellations. About 36 percent of the
Bank/IDA lending, $293 million, has been for infrastructure projects in
power, transportation, and water supply and $38 million has been for popu-
lation and education. Of the remainder about $216 million has been for
agriculture and about $250 million for industry. There has been a marked
improvement in the way Bank financed projects in the Philippines have been
executed in the last three years, compared with experience in the 1960s,
whien shortages of peso counterpart funds combined with poor administration



to cause serious problems. All these projects are now going reasonably well.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC
investments as of January 31, 1976 and notes on the execution of on-going
projects.
22.       The Bank's lending program has been designed to continue to support
the Philippine development effort with its particular emphasis on
agriculture and infrastructure. Shortages of domestic revenues led to low
investment for these purposes in the past. The last three years have seen
major changes which have helped to overcome these constraints and both the
ambitious Philippine development program and the Bank's lending program have
been designed to make good past neglect and to meet future needs. Commit-
ments in FY74 amounted to $165.1 million, and in FY75 $208 million compared
to an average of about $30 million a year in the preceding five years.
23.       Two loans, one of $42 million for the Magat River Multipurpose
Project and one of $75 million for the Industrial Investment Credit Project,
have already been approved by the Executive Directors in FY76. In addition
to this project and the proposed Third Education Project, other loans for
fisheries, grain storage, urban development and irrigation may be ready
for Board consideration in FY76.
24.       IFC has made commitments in the Philippines totalling $76.2
million for investments in 13 companies in the fields of development bank-
ing, power, telecommunications, ceramic tiles, paper, petroleum products,
nickel mining and refining, chemicals and synthetic fibers. Of these
investments, as of January 31, 1976, $18.9 million had been sold, $0.4
million cancelled and $3.4 million repaid, leaving a net portfolio of
$53.5 million. On the same date all commitments were fully disbursed.
Preliminary proposals have been received for an aluminum smelter and
other projects in the pulp and paper, dinnerware, metal alloys and ship-
building fields.
PART III - THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR
25.       The performance of the agricultural sector is crucial, since prob-
lems of poverty and income distribution are particularly acute in the rural
areas. Of the 15 million people in the bottom 40 percent of the income scale,
12 million live in the rural areas. The Government is attempting to deal with
the problems by undertaking agrarian reform, increasing institutional support
to agriculture to raise productivity of the small farmers and by encouraging
diversification. Development of the livestock sub-sector is important in the
effort to diversify agricultural production and to raise the incomes of small
farmers.  Currently, the livestock sub-sector contributes about 18 percent of
totaL agricultural output and about 5 percent of gross domestic product.
26.       The per capita intake of meat products has not increased sig-
nificantly over the past decade, and in recent years may even have decreased
as a result of relatively high meat prices. Although demand has in part



- 7 -
shifted to cheaper fish 1:roduc-ts, prices of these, products have also in-
creased substantially so that the total consumption of both meat and
fish has decreased since 1970. With the projected recovery in the growth
of urban incomes, demand for livestock products could grow at about 6 per-
cent a year in the future. Most of the demand over the next decade will
probably continue to be i:or pork and poultry meat, although the relative
importance of beef will continue to increase.   To limit the extent to which
this anticipated growth :in demand for livestock products is met by imports,
to facilitate price stab-ilization for livestock products and to increase
small farmer incomes, the Government has been putting. special emphasis on
livestock development.
27.       The major const:raints on the growth of the livestock industry
in the past have-been the lack of long-term credit, inadequate livestock
extension services and the lack of higher quality feeds. In order to help
in alleviating these problems, the Government requested the Bank in 1970 to
finance a first livestock project and the proposed loan is expected to
continue the support provided, under Loan 823-PH to meet the requirements
of a growing livestock industry.
28.       The first loan of $7.5 million, made in 1972 was for:    (a) a
program of livestock development in specified areas, carried out by the
Development Bank of the Philippines. (DBP); it was assigned to provide
assistance to some 1,450 small and medium size pig, poultry and integra-
ted coconut/beef cattle farms, 25 hill beef cattle ranches, and 3 slaugh-
terhouses; and (b) technical services for DBP.and livestock research.
After a slow start, caused largely by delay in recruitment of technical
advisors, the project is now progressing satisfactorily, and all farm/
ranch funds have been committed. Other Bank assistance over the years for
livestock development in the Philippines has been provided through two Rural
Credit Projects (Loans 607-PH and 1010-PH), administered by the Central
Bank of the Philipines and carried out by the rural banks; about 8 percent
of funds under Loan 607-PH and 6 percent so far under Loan 1010-PH have been
onlent to livestock farmers, mainly for pig and poultry development.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Description of the Project
29.       The proposed project would:   a) continue to assist the Philippines
to increase domestic production of livestock products by providing funds
to DBP for onlending to l:Lvestock producers particularly for smallholder pig
and poultry operations; b') improve the technical services provided to DBP's
sub-borrowers; c) provide for applied research and trials on specific live-
stock production problems and assist with the establishment of a feed quality
control system; d) assist the country to upgrade municipal slaughterhouses
which need to be rehabilitated and improved to meet hig.her standards.   Spe-
cifically, the proposed project would help finance about 1,850 pig farms, 460
poultry farms, 200 small-scale beef cattle farms, 440 integrated coconut cat-
tle farms (where coconut and cattle are developed within the same farms), 60



- 8 -
hill beef farms (beef cattle development on hilly pastureland), 10 municipal
slaughterhouses, and supporting technical services, training and research.
The loan would finance fixed investment costs and incremental working capital
for both farm development and slaughterhouses.
30.       The project was prepared by DBP.   A Bank mission appraised the
project in April/May 1975 and negotiations were held in January, 1976. The
leader of the Government negotiating team was Ambassador Eduardo Z. Romualdez.
The Appraisal Report (No.1070-PH) on the proposed project is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III provides a loan and project
summary.
Major Objectives of the Project
31.       The project would support Government objectives of increasing
livestock production by helping alleviate existing constraints through
the provision of credit, better research and extension and a system for
improving animal feeds. In designing the project, attention has been given
to meeting the needs of smaller farmers and the rural poor, and it is
estimated that about 80 percent of the direct and indirect beneficiaries
of the project presently have per capita income of less than $140. The
component for development of backyard cattle farms (maintaining a few heads of
beef or dairy cattle on small farm plots) has considerable potential for
increasing the production and incomes of small farmers.
Project Execution
32.       As in the first project, the credit component of this project
will be executed by DBP, a wholly Government-owned development bank which
operates in all sectors of the economy. A thorough analysis of DBP's overall
capabilities and financial position was provided in the President's Report for
the Second Industrial Investment Credit Project (See R75-239) reviewed by
the Executive Directors at a meeting on December 16, 1975. Over the years,
DBP has administered a number of Bank assisted projects in the industrial,
shipping and agricultural (grain processing and storage, fishing and live-
stock) sectors and the implementation of these projects has been satisfatory.
The Livestock and Poultry Group, within the Agricultural Projects Department
of DBP, would have the responsibility for implementing the proposed project.
The feed quality control and research components would be the responsibility
of the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) in the Department of Agriculture.
The Project Area
33.       Under the First Project, it was agreed to limit sub-loans
to specific areas of the country (Central and Southern Luzon, North and South
Mindanao and Mindoro and Masbate islands) to ensure that DBP would
have the capacity to process and service sub-loans. However, DBP's loans
processing and supervision capabilities have improved as more branches
and agencies have been opened; therefore, this limitation under the First
Project has been relaxed and will be removed under the proposed project
(Para B.1 of Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement).



- 9 -
Training, Technical Services and Research
34.       The Livestock and Poultry Group of DBP was established under
the First Livestock Pro;ject and has since grown in strength and expertise.
However, DBP does need l:o improve further its capacity to provide technical
services to livestock sub-borowers, undertake promotional work and conduct
monitoring programs. To assist and train DBP's field staff in these matters,
it would continue to employ a cattle production specialist and would engage a
farm monitoring special:ist (Section 3.04 of the Loan Agreement). DBP would
also continue to conducl: a program to ensure that an adequate number of its
staff are trained to carry out its livestock development program (Part B of
Schedule 2 to the Loan ligreement).
35.       To support the livestock development program, the Government would
employ four short term specialists to undertake research in the areas of
pig and poultry nutriticin, the use of by-products by ruminants and backyard
cattle production systemis. To supplement and back up the work of the short
term consultants, the Government would make arrangements to carry out a
program of applied research on pig and poultry nutrition under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank and shall assist in financing the execution
of this program with a grant of not less than the equivalent of $150,000
(Section 3.07 of the Loan Agreement). The research conducted under the
project is expected to niake an important contribution towards improving feed
products which have in the past been a constraint on increasing livestock
production. In addition, the Government would establish an effective feed
quality control system, including construction and equipping of a feed quality
analysis laboratory.
36.       Since 1973, DBP has had an agreement with the BAI to coordinate
their work in the development of livestock production. Under this agree-
ment, DBP provides borrowers with technical assistance and advisory ser-
vices for planning, budgeting and marketing and BAI provides animal husbandry
and veterinary technical services upon the request of DBP. However, this
agreement is not very effective because BAI technicians do not normally assist
in the early stages of sub-project preparation and therefore there is little
incentive for them to get involved at a later stage of enterprise developmernt.
Since DBP cannot be expected to provide full livestock extension services
from its own resources, it would, under the project, renegotiate with BAI and
implement a new agreement which would provide for BAI technicians to be
involved in sub-loan projects from the outset. The conclusion of the revised
agreement between BAI an, DBP would be a condition of effectiveness of the
loan (Sections 3.06 and 5.01(B) of the Loan Agreement).
Project Cost and Financi,a
37.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $41.3 million equi-
valent, of which $12.4 million would be in foreign exchange. The Bank loan
of $20.5 million would finance about 50 perent of total costs, including the
foreign exchange component and $8.1 million of the local cost requirements.
It would have a term of L4-1/2 years, including 5-1/2 years of grace. The
Government would relend $19.8 million of the loan to DBP on the same terms as



- 10 -
that of the Bank loan, and would assume the foreign exchange risk. As a
condition of effectiveness, a subsiary loan agreement would be entered into
between the Government and DBP (Section 5.01(a) of the Loan Agreement). The
balance of the loan ($0.7 million) would be used by the Government to finance
the cost of the four short term research consultants and related research
equipment and supplies and equipment and material for the feed quality control
laboratory.
38.       DBP would on-lend the Bank funds to private sub-borrowers and
municipalities (for slaughterhouses). Most sub-borrowers would contribute
about 10 percent to the cost of their projects, but the major sub-borrowers
and municipalities would contribute a minimum of 25 percent. The aggregate
amount of loan proceeds used for farm sub-loans to major borrowers (sub-loans
exceeding $100,000) would be limited to a total of $3 million of Bank funds.
Of this amount, not more than $500,000 would be for large poultry and piggery
subprojects; leaving the balance of $2.5 million for large sub-projects for
cattle development (Para 4(b) and (c) of Schedule 1 to the Loan Agreement).
Interest rates of sub-loans would be in accordance with DBP's interest rate
policy which provides for 12 percent per annum for small loans of less than
P5,000 and other loans fully secured by land, and 14 percent for all
other loans. In addition, large sub-borrowers would pay a one-time 2 percent
service fee. The sub-loans would generally have repayment periods of 8 to 13
years, including grace periods of 2 to 5 years, depending on the nature of
the sub-project. The Government has recently raised the existing ceilings on
lending rates in the Philippines to 17 percent for short term lending and 19
percent for long term lending. DBP is now actively considering the implica-
tions of this change for its own interest policies and has agreed to keep the
Bank informed of its plans.
39.       Under DBP's lending procedures, sub-loans of less than P50,000
($6,670) would be approved by branch managers subject to confirmation by
DBP Board. DBP would use the standard sub-loan agreement approved by the
Bank for the First Livestock Project and would not materially change this
form without prior approval of the Bank (Para B.?, Schedule 5 to the Loan
Agreement). All subloans for slaughterhouse construction and all subloans
which exceed the equivalent of $200,000 will be made after approval of the Bank
(Para B.6, Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement).
Procurement
40.       Equipment and materials for farm development ($35.6 million), as
under the First Livestock Project, would be procured by farmers from local
suppliers. There are generally adequate commercial outlets for the main
inputs to permit sub-borrowers to obtain supplies at competitive prices.
The scattered location and phasing over several years of the farm sub-loan
projects and the diversity of equipment and supplies required makes bulk
purchase of inputs impractical. Some of the local suppliers are sub-
sidiaries or associate companies of international firms. Slaughterhouse
contracts (totalling about $1.9 million) would not be suitable for inter-
national bidding and would therefore be awarded after local advertisement
in accordance with the Bank Guidelines. These contracts are small, widely



- 11 -
scattered geographically and construction would be phased over the project
implementation period. There is adequate local fabrication and construction
capability and competition to ensure that the relatively simple slaughter-
houses proposed can be procured efficiently. Contracts for technical services
(about $0.2 million) may be financed under bilateral aid but will otherwise be
awarded according to standard Bank procedures. The vehicles and equipment
($160,000) required for administering the project and for technical services
would be procured locally by DBP, using its normal procurement procedures
which are satisfactory. Bulk international procurement of vehicles and
equipment required by DBP to carry out the project is not warranted because
requirements are phased over several years and the lot sizes are too small to
be attractive to international bidders. Equipment and materials for feed
quality control ($0.4 million) would be procured following international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines.
Disbursement
41.       The proposed Bank loan would help finance DBP's sub-loan commit-
ments over the next three years and the loan would be disbursed over about
5-1/2 years. The Bank would reimburse, against appropriate documents, 50
percent of medium and long term loans granted by DBP to project benefi-
ciaries for pig, poultry, backyard cattle, dairy and slaughterhouses and 55
percent for coconut beef and hill beef loans; 100 percent of the Foreign
exchange costs or 60 percent of the local costs of technical experts; 100
percent of the c.i.f. cost of imported materials and equipment, 100 percent of
the ex-fatory cost of goods produced in the Philippines or 60 percent of the
total cost of imported items procured within the country. Since the project
would support DBP's ongoing livestock program and the proceeds of the First
Livestock Loan was fully committed at the end of 1975, it is proposed that the
proposed loan finance retroactively up to $1.5 million of costs incurred under
DBP's livestock lending program after December 31, 1975.
Benefits and Justification
42.       The proposed project would contribute to Government's objective
of increasing the production of meat, eggs and milk, help stabilize the
prices for these products and encourage development of small-scale livestock
production by poorer farmers. Furthermore, the project would continue the
institution building role begun under the First Project by strengthening
the Livestock and Poultry Group of DBP and the DBP branches and by involving
the Bureau of Animal Industry in the project more directly in support of
DBP's lending program. Incremental net income to the 3,050 farm families
participating in the project would average $2,210 per annum at full develop-
ment with a range from $410 to $6,300. The present incomes of these families
cover a wide range, but it is estimated that about 1,300 farm families with an
annual income of less than $800 per annum would benefit from the project.
43.       At full development (Year 11), the project would generate some
5,800 permanent jobs and indirectly a large number of jobs in the production
of feedstuffs, transportation and marketing. It would result in net foreign
exchange savings of $17 million a year at full development. Social benefits



- 12 -
of the project would be substantial, since about 80 percent of direct and
indirect beneficiaries are within the target rural poverty group witlh a
per capita income of less than $140. The economic rate of return is estimated
to be 25 percent. Sensitivity analyses indicate that even under a number
of adverse assumptions, the rate of return would not fall below 13 percent.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
44.        The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the text
of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
separately to the Executive Directors. The loan would not become ef-
fective until a subsidiary loan agreement is concluded between the Govern-
ment and DBP and until a revised technical assistance agreement has been
concluded between the Bureau of Animal Industry and DBP. The draft Agree-
ment conforms to the normal pattern for loans for livestock projects.
45.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
46.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

Ln. No. 637-PH       Upper Pampanga River Irrigation; US$34.0 million Loan
of August 18, 1969; Date of Effectiveness: October 15,
1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
This is the first major irrigation project in the Philippines and
will supply water year-round to nearly all its 84,000 ha command area. The
project's on-farm development scheme is setting a pattern for future irriga-
tion development in the country. Despite some delays caused by the 1972
floods, the dam was commissioned on September 7, 1974 ahead of schedule. Most
of the work has been completed and the loan is expected to be entirely dis-
bursed by June 30, 1976, the Closing Date. Project costs have increased 40%
over appraisal estimates, largely as a result of rapid inflation, the effects
of successive devaluations of the peso, and design changes in the dam (which
accounted for nearly half the increase in costs). The increase in costs is
being financed by the Government. However, as a result of the close coor-
dination established between irrigation and agricultural supporting services,
the project is expected to reach full development in 7 years after comple-
tion of construction, instead of 13 years which was the appraisal estimate.
Also, nearly 7,000 ha have been added to the project, mostly by including
lands which were formerly under a private irrigation system. Finally, there
has been a considerable increase in the projected world market price of rice.
As a result, the rate of return estimate is now more favorable than at
appraisal.
Ln. No. 720-PH       Rice Processing and Storage; US$14.3 million Loan of
February 4, 1971; Date of Effectiveness: May 10, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
This project provides long-term credit through the Development
Bank of the Philippines to finance a program for the development and modern-
ization of the rice and corn processing industry. Originally the project
was restricted to rice and to the private sector, and the emphasis was on
the construction of new integrated rice mills with large capacities. Due
in part to poor harvests and in part to large cost increases for rice mills,
the demand for sub-loans for new integrated rice mills turned out to be
small, and, as expalined in the President's Memorandum dated June 8, 1972
(R72-40), the loan agreement was amended to shift the project emphasis to
rehabilitation of existing rice milling facilities. In spite of this the
project made little progress.   The loan agreement was amended again in
April, 1974 basically (i) to expand the scope of the project to include

the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken

understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evalua-
tion of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

corn in addition to rice, (ii) to enable local governments and the National
Grains Authority to borrow funds under the project,. and (iii) to streamline
procurement procedures (President's memorandum SecM74-244 of April 15, 1974).
As a result of these amendments, the project is now progressing satisfactori-
ly and the loan is expected to be fully disbursed before the revised
Closing Date, June 30, 1977.
Ln. No. 731-PH       Highway; US$8.0 million Loan of April 14, 1971;
Date of Effectiveness:  July 23   1971  Closing Date:
June 30, 1976
The project is financing the construction and improvement of the
Cotabato - Digos road in Mindanao (160 km.). Construction is only 55% com-
plete based on the original scope of works, the delay being mainly due to
civil disturbances and army activity on part of the road representing about
20% of the total roadworks. As there is little chance of the contractor
being able to enter this area, the Bank has agreed to a Government proposal
to delete this stretch of the road from the contract and eventually execute
the work by force account; the undisbursed amount of the loan fund will be
applied to the balance of works which can be completed by contract. The
total cost of the reduced project is estimated to be about US$16.4 million
compared to appraisal estimate of US$15.8 million. The increase in cost is
due to a rise in construction costs which has been substantial since oil
price increases in late: 1973. The roadworks have been completed in December
1975. The other components of the project including UNDP-financed feas-
ibility studies were completed in 1973. The closing date has been extended
from May 15, 1975 to June 30, 1976. Technical assistance to the Department
of Public Highways is continuing with Bank financing under the Second High-
way Project.
Ln. No. 809-PH       Fifth Power; US$22.0 million and US$10.0 million Loan
and                  and Credit of April 3, 1972; Date of Effectiveness:
Cr. No. 296-PH      July 1, 1972; Closing Date:   June 30, 1978
The project Is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance the construction of a second thermal unit of 150-MW at Bataan and
transmission facilities in Luzon. The project is proceeding satisfactorily,
and the unit is expected to be commissioned during the second quarter of
1976. The erection of transmission lines has been somewhat delayed due to
unfavorable weather and poor soil conditions and is now-expected to be
completed in June 1976. Further tariff increases were approved, effective
July 1, 1974 and again in July 1, 1975, although this last increase still
has not received Presidential approval. No major problems are anticipated.
Ln. No. 823-PH      Livestock; US$7.5 million Loan of May 25, 1972;
Date of Effectiveness: November 9, 1972; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The project is assisting Government in carrying out its livestock
development program through credit supervised by the Development Bank of the

Philippines.   The start of DBP lending operations was delayed by about six
months because of late appointment of technical staff. Although sub-loan
commitments were slow as a result of this, they improved so that all funds
were fully committed by December, 1975. The project has expanded the
agricultural credit capability of DBP into a new and important field thus
meeting a previously unsatisfied demand for small to medium scale livestock
development finance.
Cr. No. 471-PH      Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Credit of
may 14, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Ln. No. 984-PH       Aurora-Penaranda Irrigation; US$9.5 million Loan of
May 14, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This is the second irrigation development and rehabilitation pro-
ject in the Philippines to be financed by the Bank. The project will divert
water from the Aurora basin into the Pantabangan Reservoir of the first pro-
ject, to provide year-round irrigation for 25,300 ha of rice land in Central
Luzon.  The project also includes an Irrigation Development Study for Central
Luzon to inventory water, land, and other resources and identify priority
irrigation projects. Although there has been some delay in constructing the
two diversion dams because of the need for more extensive foundations and
abutment area grouting than originally expected, most difficulties have been
overcome and the work is progressing satisfactorily. Diversion of 75% of
Aurora water into Pantabangan Reservoir was achieved in September, 1975, one
year ahead of the appraisal schedule. In the service area, lack of competi-
tion and high bids have delayed awardinig of contracts. Urgent work is being
done by Government force account, although the Credit Agreement sets a force
account limit of about 20% on civil works in the service area. Project costs
have increased abouu 54% over appraisal estimates, largely as a result of
rapid inflation. "here would be added benefits from early diversion, however,
resulting in addific-ai1 wtater -or irrigation sooner rhan planned, and the
rate of return is expected to fall from 17% at appraisal to 14%.
Ln. No. 998-PH       I1adustrial Investment and Smallholder Tree-farmers:
US$50.0 million Loan of June 12. 1974; Date of
Effectiveness: Septenber 9,2 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, r1981
The proceeds of the loan are being relent co the Development Bank
of the Philippines (DBP). The industrial portion of tht loan (US$48 mil-
lion) is being used by DBP to make sub-loans to finance direLt imports for
medium and relatively large industrial projects. DBP is using the balance
(US$2 million) to finance about ',300 smallholders in a pilot tree-farming
project. As of December 31, 1975 commitments for sub-loans totalling $37
million had been made.

Date of Effectiveness: August 27, 1974; Closin& Date:
December 31-, 1977
The Central Bank relends the proceeds of the Loan (except for
a small amount for an evaLluation study) to participating banks. These on-
lend the funds to farmerEl and rural entrepreneurs to finance investment in
farm mechanization, on-farm transportation, farm support facilities and
equipment, coastal and irLland fisheries, small-scale livestock development
and cottage-scale agro-irtdustry. The project also provides for a review
of the effectiveness of the First, Second and this project. The loan became
effective on August 27, 1974, and is expected to be fully committed in 1976.
Collection of arrears by a sizeable number of participating banks from bene-
ficiaries under the first and second projects is not satisfactory. This is
being watched closely by Bank staff and appropriate steps are being taken
to improve such collections.
Ln. No. 1034-Ph     Sixth. Power; US$61.0 million Loan of July 31, 1974;
Date of Effectiveness: November 15, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The project is helping the National Power Corporation (NPC) to
finance a 100 MW hydro plant at Pantabangan and transmission lines for the
further expansion of the Luzon grid and feasibility studies by consultants
for a future power project. Major equipment for the plant has been contracted
and project commissioning is expected in January 1977 - three months ahead
of original schedule. The transmission component of the project is pro-
ceeding in stages. Some lines are under construction and others are in
procurement process. The design work has been delayed due to NPC's heavy
construction program. It is now expected that this part of the project will
be completed by the end of 1978, i.e. one year behind schedule. NPC raised
its tariffs on July 1, 1974, to meet the covenanted rate of return of 8
percent. But due to inflation NPC was not able to achieve this. NPC
therefore increased tariffs on July 1, 1975, but this increase still has
not received Presidential approval.
Cr. No. 349-PH      Second Education; US$12.7 million Credit of January 5,
1273 Date of Effectiveness: April 11, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1978
The Credit is helping to finance a project for development of
technical and vocational education and for improvement in curriculum devel-
opment and teacher traininag. Construction has been about 12 months behind
schedule mainly due to delays in the finalization of design/drawing of
buildings and recruitment of specialist services. This delay is being
reduced through effective management by the project unit. Procurement of
equipment is on schedule. Both the program and schedule of technical
assistance have been revised to suit the current needs of project institu-
tions and to expedite implementation. Disbursements (US$4.9 million as
of 2/11/76) are ahead of the appraisal estimate. Project costs are
estimated at about 32 percent above the appraisal estimates. The Government
has agreed to finance the resulting overruns. Despite initial delays, the
project is expected to be completed on schedule.
