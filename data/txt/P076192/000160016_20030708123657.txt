3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
         Background

Economic Improvements through 2000.               The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR
Macedonia) maintained general macroeconomic stability during 1996-2000. Inflation averaged 2 percent,
even with the impact on prices of a new Value Added Tax (VAT) in 2000. The fiscal account was
approximately balanced and GDP growth averaged 4.1 percent. Policy reforms that had been stalled since
before the elections of 1998 were taken up in 2000-01.        Sale or closure of remaining state owned
enterprises progressed including the sale of the country's largest bank. The Government established a
three-year IMF arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and the Extended Fund
Facility and secured the Second Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan/Credit through the Bank
in late 2000.

The Emergency Situation and Its Impact. These positive trends changed with the ethnic Albanian
insurgency in 2001, creating an emergency in FYR Macedonia. The insurgency was resolved when an
internationally mediated peace agreement was signed on August 13, 2001 by the main political parties in
FYR Macedonia, representing ethnic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians. The parliament ratified the peace
agreement, by amending the constitution to strengthen minority rights. The conflict severely damaged the
economy in 2001 as trade and private financial flows weakened and foreign and domestic investment has
plummeted. Increased security expenses coupled with declining tax revenues worsened the government's
budget position by 6 percent of GDP. The balance of payments deteriorated sharply because of trade
disruptions and general uncertainty. Official reserves losses are estimated to have exceeded US$ 200
million for the year.

Objective

In response to this emergency, the original objective of FYR Macedonia's Emergency Economic Recovery
Credit (EERC-US$ 15 million equivalent) was "to help restore economic activity disrupted by the recent
emergency through enhanced access by the private sector to critical imports" (from the Technical Annex
for an Emergency Economic Recovery Credit, November 19, 2001). The basis for the EERC is provided
by OP 8.50 (August 1995), which states that the main objectives of "emergency recovery assistance are to
restore assets and production levels in the disrupted economy." OP 8.50 further states that Bank
emergency assistance may take the form of [inter alia] provision of an emergency recovery loan (ERL)."
The EERC was an appropriate instrument to address the emergency in FYR Macedonia. The EERC was
designed to provide the Government with US$ 15 million in foreign exchange so that private importers
would be more able to purchase the foreign exchange necessary to import goods that were critical to
economic recovery. This EERC followed the Emergency Recovery Credit (ERC-US$ 50 million
equivalent, effective June 17, 1999 and closed on December 31, 2000). The ERC was in response to a
previous crisis which began in the spring of 1999 when nearly 600,000 refugees from Kosovo fled into
FYR Macedonia.

EERC's objectives were consistent with FYR Macedonia's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) that was
discussed by the Board in September 2001. The TSS provided a framework for rapid Bank intervention in
the post-conflict period and served as a bridge from the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) that was
discussed by the Board on August 4, 1998, to cover FY99-01 until a new CAS could be agreed. The
EERC objectives are also consistent with the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) which
was presented in December 2000. The EERC was effective on December 19, 2001 and closed on

3.2 Revised Objective:
No revisions.

3.3 Original Components:
The EERC was an investment operation, which contained only one component that financed critical
imports (categories specified in Schedule 4 of the Development Credit Agreement) by the private sector.
Although the project became effective on December 19, 2001, imports (up to 20 percent of the credit) could
be financed retroactively to September 1, 2001 (as provided in OP 8.50). The qualified imports belonged
to a positive list of goods deemed necessary for recovery, particularly production inputs and capital
equipment. As an ERL and an investment operation, the EERC did not include conditionality, but it did
support macroeconomic objectives by providing financing to the budget. "ERLs do not attempt to address
long-term economic, sectoral, or institutional problems, and do not include conditionality linked to
macro-economic policies." (OP 8.50).

The straightforward design of the EERC ensured ease of implementation, which was consistent with the
timely delivery of urgently needed foreign exchange. The EERC design benefited from Bank experience
with emergency recovery operations in other countries as well as from the ERC.           In an emergency
operation, there is concern about adherence to principles of financial management, as was the case with the
EERC. The lesson learned from EERC's predecessor, the ERC, however, noted that these principles
"cannot be strictly applied because they would delay disbursement." The QAG for the ERC supported this
position by stating that "insisting as a condition of effectiveness, `that independent auditors...have been
retained....'may only jeopardize quickly achieving the emergency credit's main objective of macroeconomic
stability ­ for little benefit in return."

The EERC design was also a model for additional assistance of US$ 25 million from the Government of
the Netherlands. Thus, the design was also helpful for mobilizing additional resources, more than doubling
the emergency foreign exchange assistance to FYR Macedonia.             Given FYR Macedonia's external
financing needs and the prospect of other donor assistance, the Bank judged that the US$15 million credit
amount of the EERC represented appropriate burden sharing by the Bank.

3.4 Revised Components:
No revisions.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
ICR ­ Satisfactory. The EERC's objectives were fully consistent with the TSS, in particular the urgent
need for financing the external funding gap. The Bank developed the positive list of imports (see Schedule
4 of the Development Credit Agreement) in consultation with the Government. This list focused on priority
goods that would be critical to FYR Macedonia's recovery. The retroactive feature ensured that FYR
Macedonia could receive almost immediate assistance upon effectiveness. The decision not to establish a
standard Special Account was appropriate because the replenishment process would have delayed
disbursement. Rather, the Bank reimbursed the National Bank based on import receipts from the Customs
department, a procedure which proved expeditious and in line with the EERC's objective. Within two
weeks of effectiveness, the Government had claimed and received the 20 percent (US$ 3 million) retroactive
portion of the credit. The EERC was also consistent with the Government's priorities to maintain levels of
imports that were critical to economic recovery.

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The achievement of objectives is rated Highly Satisfactory. The objective was to support the restoration of
assets and production levels immediately after the civil disturbances which had damaged the economy in
mid- to late 2001. Specifically, the EERC financed 10-15 percent of the incremental external financing
gap for 2001 and helped increase imports of critical goods. The EERC was fully disbursed in less than five
months after effectiveness, and 97 percent was disbursed in less than three months. Table 1 gives the
disbursement profile of the EERC.

The macroeconomic response to the EERC and other financing and policy measures is reflected in Table 2.
Economic growth recovered from ­4.5 percent in 2001 to 0.3 percent in 2002, a large improvement, but
still short of the rates achieved (3.4 to 4.5 percent) prior to the crisis. Inflation fell to 1.0 percent and the
government cash balance improved from ­7.2 percent to ­4.6 percent of GDP.

In addition to the general improvement in the macroeconomic indicators, the EERC encouraged other
donors to commit funds to FYR Macedonia. On March 12, 2002, donors pledged US$ 154 million to
support balance of payments needs, US$ 76 million for post-conflict reconstruction and US$ 45 million to
finance the implementation of measures under the August 2001 peace agreement. Unfortunately, for
reasons beyond the control of the EERC (discussed in section 5), these commitments have not been fully
realized.


4.2 Outputs by components:
Section 4.1 describes the outputs since this was a single component operation. The private sector imported
only goods from a positive list, which excluded luxury goods, military equipment, nuclear reactors or other

dangerous or banned products (see Schedule 4 of the DCA).

Table 3 summarizes the performance indicators supplied by the Government in compliance with Section
3.04 of the DCA. The industrial production indicators were selected because they are reported frequently
(monthly) and closely track GDP growth. Through these indicators, it can be determined whether industrial
production could be preserved as a result of the EERC and other donor funds that would allow FYR
Macedonia to maintain imports that are needed for industrial production such as capital goods and
productive inputs. Clearly, during 2002, industrial production fluctuated severely, struggling to regain the
level of the average 2001 index, falling back in August 2002 to only 80 percent of the 2001 monthly
average but then recovering strongly for the remainder of the year. Although the industrial production
index was the main performance indicator, it is a general index reflecting many forces in the economy other
than the EERC. The EERC financing was only 1 percent of FYR Macedonia's import bill. It is probable
however, that industrial production would have fallen further were it not for the external financing of the
EERC and the additional financing, particularly from the Government of the Netherlands, that it
encouraged (see following para.).

The second performance indicator is the volume of other donor support that the EERC encouraged. Donor
assistance in 2002 was somewhat improved from the low levels of 2001, and the EERC played a key role
in facilitating US$ 25 million of assistance from the Government of the Netherlands which disbursed during
January through April 2002.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The EERC, as an emergency operation, did not focus on institutional development. However, the EERC's
successful implementation demonstrated that the implementation process learned under the ERC was intact
despite the crisis. The implementation of EERC further developed the national capacity to comply with
Bank procedures and to quickly set up a mechanism to channel funds that were urgently needed. In that
respect, the institutional development impact may be considered modest.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The main factor outside the control of the government/implementing agencies were the political forces at
play leading up to the elections in September 2002. The Government in power at the time of the EERC
faced a strong and ultimately successful challenge from the opposition party. These political issues
impeded progress in establishing an IMF program and led other donors to postpone releasing the financial
support committed at the March 2002 donor roundtable meeting.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
The Parliament adopted the constitutional amendments specified in the August 2001 peace agreement. It
also met the Bank procurement requirements and produced receipts from the approved list of imports
stipulated in the DCA. With the peaceful conclusion of the September 2002 elections, the new Government
can now turn its attention to economic recovery. The new government reached agreement in February 2003
with the IMF on a new macroeconomic program, which will facilitate the disbursement of funds from other
donors.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
The National Bank and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) cooperated well in implementing the project. Their
compliance with Bank procedures allowed for rapid disbursements. They also managed to guide the
economy to recovery as GDP growth increased from -4.5 percent in 2001 to 0.3 percent in 2002.

5.4 Costs and financing:
The total original credit amount was US$ 15 million equivalent (SDR 11.6 million). All funds were
disbursed. The credit was made on hardened IDA terms with a maturity of 20 years, a 10-year grace
period, and an IDA service charge of 75 basis points. The EERC also led to an additional US$ 25 million
of parallel financing by the Government of the Netherlands.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The sustainability of the EERC is rated likely. The sustainability of an emergency operation hinges on the
operation's contribution to easing the crisis and resuming a path of growth. The Technical Annex for the
EERC cited the major risk that growth might fail to recover which would increase the fiscal deficit and
require additional funds from donors. There was also the risk that, although the EERC encouraged
resource mobilization from the donor community, the lack of a sound macroeconomic framework
established with the IMF would stall the disbursement of these funds. The EERC was implemented
according to plan by the end of March 2002, and although industrial production fluctuated, overall growth
resumed. Political concerns leading up to the September 2002 diminished investment and general economic
activity, which slowed economic recovery. With the positive growth in 2002 and the focus on a sound
macroeconomic framework, the recovery appears sustainable.




                                                     - 6 -

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Now that the emergency is past, the Bank is returning to more normal operations, a centerpiece of which
will be support for public sector management reform through a series of adjustment loans. The EERC
helped keep the donor community active, and FYR Macedonia has succeeded in agreeing on a new
macroeconomic program supported by the IMF (a 14-month standby arrangement approved in April 2003).
One concern is that the commitments made by donors at the March roundtable meeting may no longer be
valid because of institutional requirements. It will be important to continued recovery that the donors
follow through on their commitments made in March 2002.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
Highly Satisfactory. The Bank was responsive to the need for emergency assistance and the resumption of
growth, and the task manager identified the appropriate delivery vehicle. An adjustment operation was not
appropriate because of the acute and urgent need for support.            The EERC was processed from
identification to effectiveness in about two months. Were the EERC a policy operation, the Bank's internal
timetable would have delayed the needed assistance. The Bank's dialog with the Government determined
that the political climate was also not conducive to making difficult policy reforms. An adjustment
operation would have been extremely difficult to implement and would likely have failed to disburse. The
opportunity for reform today is stronger, because the EERC was an ERL.

The lending aspect of the EERC was consistent with the country strategy as expressed in the TSS. The
TSS cited four post-conflict priorities: 1) balance of payments; 2) reconstruction; 3) social cohesion and 4)
decentralization. The EERC responded to the first priority by financing a portion of the incremental
external gap.

7.2 Supervision:
Satisfactory. The supervision process went smoothly. Disbursements were made quickly, ahead of the
plan. The Bank's resident mission in Skopje assisted the implementing agencies with the disbursement
process. The Bank complied fully with OP 8.50 limiting retroactive financing to 20 percent of the credit
amount and instituting standard Bank procurement policies. The EERC was implemented as an ERL
rather than an adjustment operation, which meant that the EERC could "finance only a positive list of
imports identified as necessary to a well defined recovery program." (OP 8.50).

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Bank performance is rated as satisfactory, because the Bank responded quickly to FYR Macedonia's
urgent need for foreign exchange in a crisis situation and because the EERC kept the donor community
active during a difficult time.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Satisfactory. The Government worked well the Bank task team and agreed on the best strategy to assist
FYR Macedonia in its economic emergency. The preparation of the EERC was rapid because of the
Government's prior experience with the ERC.




7.5 Government implementation performance:
Satisfactory.    The Ministry of Finance and National Bank quickly mobilized to set up an effective



                                                     - 7 -

mechanism to process the disbursements without the need for a Special Account. The statements of
expenditure were properly prepared showing imports from the approved list and there were no delays in
their submission. In addition, the retroactive portion (20 percent) of the credit was fully utilized within two
weeks of effectiveness.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
Highly Satisfactory. See 7.5 above. The MOF produced monthly progress reports and selected an
independent private auditor, which carried out the final audit as agreed. The National Bank managed
project accounts and provided timely financial information on project financing and expenditures. It also
kept documentation on eligible imports, prepared monthly financial reports, and supported the work of the
independent auditor.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
Satisfactory. Borrower performance was essential to a successful EERC.


8. Lessons Learned


l An Emergency Economic Recovery Credit provides a fast way to deliver urgently needed
    financial support through an investment channel in post-conflict environments.             The EERC was
    an appropriate vehicle because the funds were urgently needed. The funds were not linked to reforms,
    because neither was there time to negotiate reforms nor was there a political climate conducive to
    policy change.

l A quick disbursing ERL type project can be justified even if the recovery program is eventually
    sidetracked. The macro framework became sidetracked in the fervor leading up to the September
    2002 elections. However, the activity of the EERC operation not only led to additional funding (US$
    25 million from the Government of the Netherlands), it kept the donor community engaged and
    encouraged them to make substantial commitments in March 2002. Though the program went off
    track, the donors had a defined program to work with, which might facilitate future disbursements.

exceptional nature of this IDA-funds allocation, the Credit was approved under so-called hardened
terms, with a repayment period of 20 years including 10 years grace period and standard IDA service

        Project description

The Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (EERC) supports the restoration of assets and production level
affected by the civil conflict in 2001, by providing immediate financing of a positive list of imports
considered necessary for the recovery effort, while supporting macroeconomic objectives. The EERC
provided an immediate, rapid-disbursing support for financing the above mentioned positive list of imports.
The Project provided assistance for a broad range of imports by the private sector, especially imported
production inputs and capital equipment. The funds for financing the Positive List of Eligible Imports were
directly used for servicing the external debt of the Republic of Macedonia, thus supporting the General
Government Budget.

        Institutional arrangements

The project was implemented by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in close cooperation with the National
Bank of the Republic of Macedonia. The agreement was concluded between the Government of the
Republic of Macedonia represented by the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank of the Republic of
Macedonia as Bank Agent of the Borrower. The project-related documents (Financial Management Reports
and the Project Monitoring Indicators) were delivered to the concerned parties (the borrowing agencies and
the World Bank) on a regular basis within the agreed deadlines (with short delay in cases when the data
were unavailable).

The National Bank provided the MOF an insight into the realization of the credit funds on regular basis by
submitting reports accompanied by appropriate tables at the end of each month.

        Implementation results

The project enabled financing of necessary imports despite the sharp declines in exports and private capital
inflows. The expected results are soon to be seen, their efficiency and application are of long-term
character and they are in compliance with the overall macroeconomic policy implemented in the Republic
of Macedonia.

The fast and efficient approval of such credit by the World Bank was a significant support offered to the
Government of the Republic of Macedonia in a period when it was most needed. The direct impact of the
project contributed to short-term macroeconomic stability and enabled mobilisation of other donor funds.
Given the fact that monthly monitoring indicators show positive trend of industrial production and
disbursements of funds from other donors, and the full amount of the Credit was disbursed, it can be
concluded that all procedures and recommendations were applied in efficient and quick manner. The Credit
had more visible effects regarding mobilization of resources from other external donors. Namely the Credit
was co-financed with additional US$ 25 million by the Kingdom of Netherlands. In addition, significant
funds were donated by the European Union and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.


We would like to emphasize the significant influence the World Bank representatives had during the project
preparation and its realization. The dialog was carried out on the basis of mutual cooperation and
confidence. The disbursed funds were allocated to the relevant departments efficiently, and their responses
came very promptly.

As for the dynamics of using the funds, it can be concluded that it was carried out according to the plan,
there were no problems i.e. no delays in the transfer of funds by World Bank Disbursement Department to
the Special/Deposit Account. We appreciate the efforts of the World Bank with respect to the rapid
accomplishment of the procedures and necessary support given to the Government of the Republic of
Macedonia.

         Project Implementation

The General withdrawal procedure was applied to disbursement of funds, pursuant to which a Deposit
Account for the Credit and a Deposit Account for the Grant were opened in the National Bank of the
Republic of Macedonia.

The funds from the Credit and the Grant were disbursed on the basis of appropriate imports realized by the
private sector (Schedule 4 of the Agreement on Credit-Positive List of Eligible Imports and pursuant to the
provisions of Schedule 1 of the Credit Agreement and item 4 of the Annex to the Grant Agreement.

The actual realization of the Credit and the Grant began in the period December 2001 - January 2002, after
completion of all other previous conditions for its effectiveness. During this period, 30 April 2002
inclusive, the following amounts were disbursed:
         -SDR 11.600.000,00 or 100% from the approved funds of the Credit, and
         -US$ 25.000.000,00 or 100 % from the approved funds of the Grant.

The disbursement of the aforementioned funds was performed by submitting four applications, as follows:

         - Application no. 1, for disbursement of funds from the Credit in the amount of US$ 3 million for
retroactive financing (pursuant to Schedule 1 item 3 (a) of the Credit Agreement) with the following
currency structure:

         -US$ 669,026.06

The funds referred to in this application were approved on 28th December 2001 and 2nd January 2002,
respectively. However, due to the fact that retroactive financing was limited to 20% of the amount from the
Credit (SDR 2.32 million), the application denominated in EUR was fully paid, and only the amount of
US$ 652,906.06 was disbursed.
