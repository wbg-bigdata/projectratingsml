China                                                                     Health Nine Project
A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
This project has two distinct main components. Component A, Improved Maternal Health and
Child Development, would reduce maternal and child mortality and morbidity and improve child survival
and development in the poorest areas of China. Component B, Improved Prevention and Control of Human
Immunodeficiency Virus, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, Sexually Transmitted Diseases
(HLV/AIDS/STDs) and Other Blood Borne Infections, would prevent and control these diseases by
implementing comprehensive and multi-sectoral public health programs at the provincial levels, and by
building technical capacity at the Central level.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: R98-107      Date of CAS progress discussion: May 28/29, 1998
1.1   The project directly responds to two main recommendations of the CAS: (a) targeted interventions
in poor areas with priority on maternal and child health and disease prevention; and (b) adoption of multi-
sectoral approaches to prevent and control non-communicable diseases, sexually transmitted diseases, and
Human Immunodeficiency Virus in high-risk areas. The project is also consistent with the Bank's most
recent health sector report in China, China: Issues and Options in Health Financi n, (Report No: 15278-
CHA, dated August 12, 1996), which emphasizes the need to strengthen public health programs and ensure
essential health services to the poor.
1.2   The project responds to the targeted intervention goal of CAS by replicating the successful
experience of the Comprehensive Maternal and Child Health Project (Cr. 2655-CHA; Health VI), to reduce
the negative effects of poverty by improving maternal and child health status indicators in an additional 113
low income counties in five relatively rural and low income provinces covering nearly 51 million persons
(four percent of China's population). It would respond to another CAS objective of spearheading efforts in
preventing and controlling emerging diseases like HlV/AIDS and STDs by implementing bold and effective
programs in 31 prefectures in four provinces, which are considered to be high risk areas, with a combined
population of 94 million, and by strengthening the capacity at the level of the Central Government.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
2.1    Despite remarkable improvements in the health status of its population, China still faces serious
disparities between rich and poor regions. For example, the national maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was
61.9 per 100,000 live births and the average rural MMR was 76 per 100,000 in 1995. However, in 1996
and 1997, the MMR in the counties of the five project provinces were: 62.7 in Hainan, 79.9 in Hunan,
262.3 in Guizhou, 68.5 in Jilin, and 462.8 in Xinjiang. Similarly, the national infant mortality rate (IMR)
was 36.4 per 1,000 live births, but the comparable IMR in the project provinces was: 45.0 in Hainan, 39.3
in Hunan, 72.3 in Guizhou, 49.7 in Jilin, and 84.3 in Xinjiang. Special surveys indicate that these rates are
likely to be considerably underestimated (50 to 100 percent) in the poorer provinces. Access to health care
is also significantly inequitable, with deep divisions between the urban and rural population. While
China's total public and private health spending per capita was RMB1 110 per year in 1993, the average
health spending of RMB 235 per capita in urban areas was almost four times the average of RMB 60 per
capita in rural areas, and the poorest quartile of the rural population only accounted for about four percent

China                                                                        Health Nine Project
of all health spending.1 To improve the situation, the Government has been implementing targeted
interventions in designated poorest counties.
2.2    After fast and steady progress until the middle of the 1980s, the rate of improvement in China's
health status has slowed and may have reversed in certain cases. This is attributed mainly to reduced
access to health services among poorer families after the collapse of the cooperative medical system in the
late 1970s, and inadequate resources allocated for public and preventive health. The Government has
realized this problem and has started promoting various risk-sharing and subsidy schemes. Recently, the
Government has also asked the provinces to substantially increase allocations for health, especially for
preventive health activities.
2.3    Rapid economic growth, reform measures, growing openness, and the country's epidemiological
transitions have brought new health problems, including a major increase in chronic diseases, the
emergence of HIV/AIDS infections, and the reemergence of STDs. Perhaps no new health problem in
China is more critical than the accelerating speed of the spread of lI-V coupled with rapidly increasing
STD infections. The first AIDS case in China was reported in 1985. This was followed by increasing
number of HIV cases among drug-users in southwest Yunnan Province with the identification of 149 cases
in 1989. By late 1997, over 8,000 HIV infections were officially reported, and the actual number is
believed to be much larger. Using stratified analysis, it was estimated that there were 10,000 HIV
infections by 1993, and scientists at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (CAPM) and selected
provincial epidemic prevention centers estimated that there were between 150,000 to 200,000 HIV
infections in China by the end of 1996.2 It is currently estimated that there are over 300,000 HIV
infections in China. Exacerbating this situation, while STDs were believed to have been eliminated from
China by the 1970s, they have increased alarmingly since then. In 1995, reported STD cases numbered
362,000, but experts estimate that real figures may be ten times greater.
2.4   In response to the first HIV infections diagnosed in China in 1985, a National AIDS Committee
was set up in 1986, followed in 1987 by the establishment of a National Programme for AIDS Prevention
and Control. MOH adopted a plan for AIDS prevention and control in 1990, in line with global policies
modified to reflect Chinese characteristics. In October 1996, State Councilor Ms. Peng Peiyun delivered a
speech at the National Conference on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, asserting that the "Government
has placed AIDS prevention and control among the priorities of the Ninth Five-Year Plan and China's
Twenty-first Century Agenda." China recently elaborated its multi-sectoral plan for AIDS prevention and
control, to give guidance to national and international partners in matters of AIDS prevention strategies and
activities well into the next century.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
3.1    The Improved Maternal Health and Child Development Component, or the MHCD Component,
would address the critical sectoral issue of improving the health status of the poorest sections of the
population and help correct the serious regional imbalances persisting in China. The strategic choices,
which are consistent with the Government strategy and the CAS, are to: (a) improve the quality and
effectiveness of maternal and child health services in the poorest and least developed areas of the country;
(b) improve access for the poorest families by helping to remove the economic and cultural barriers to
essential obstetric and child care, building on the experience under previous Bank health projects; and (c)

cause the provinces and counties to significantly increase resources available for preventive health,
especially for maternal and child care.
3.2    The Improved Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS/STDs and Other Blood Borne Infections
Component, or the HIV/AIDS/STDs Component, would assist the Government to substantially improve the
prevention and control of the new health problems arising from emergence of HIV/AIDS and the
reemergence of STDs in China. The main strategy would be to implement comprehensive multi-sectoral
approaches based on successful experiences in various parts of the world and the experiences already
gained in China, including the strengthening of the national capacity to plan and implement such programs,
and the carrying out of comprehensive programs in selected high-risk populations of the country.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:-
T'he proposed project includes strong policy and institutional reform measures.
2.1    Under the MHCD Componen, the project would: (a) revise and improve the case management
protocols for maternal and child care and health workers' training on improved methods and materials; (b)
introduce early child development progrwns; (c) strengthen MCH management at all levels; and (d)
establish a system to improve the access of the poorest families.
2.2    The HIV/AIDS/STDs Component would include a number of policy measures, including the
training and licensing of private practitioners dealing with STD patients, maintaining anony*lity of
HIV/STD patients, provide outreach to sex workers and their clients, and drug users, harmn reduction
measures, and school health and sex education. This component will also support a national reference
center to improve the technical capacity in this new field.
2.3    The blood transfusion services subcomponen would assist the Government in initiating a major
change in China's practice of blood collection, testing, and clinical use. Specifically, in addition to helping
the Government implement the 1997 Blood Donation Law by moving to a voluntary unpaid system of
blood donation, the project would also improve safety in testing, storage, and transport of blood, and
initiate training and education to improve the use of blood.

China                                                                      Health Nine Project
3. Benefits and target population:
3.1    Through the MHCD Component, the project will most directly benefit about one million mothers
and their newborns each year in 113 of China's poorest counties located in five relatively poor provinces
(Guizhou, Hainan, Hunan, Jilin, and Xinjiang) from higher quality and greater access to health services,
which have been tested in China and are known to contribute to reductions in MMR and IMR. The Mid-
term Evaluation of the Comprehensive MCH Project (Cr. 2655-CHA; Health VI) has shown that the
project can be expected to result in significant reductions in the IMR, U5MR, and MMR in the targeted
poverty designated counties to levels approaching the national average rates. In addition to these health
status benefits, households will also benefit in the following ways: (a) ensuring economic productivity of
the families by saving the lives of adult women; (b) ensuring the continuation of non-market produced
household goods and services; and (c) reducing medical care costs for MCH related services (especially
hospital delivery care) for the most impoverished families in these poor counties via the locally
administered poverty relief funds.
3.2    While the direct benefits of the HIV/AIDS/STDs Component will benefit those at highest risk of
contracting HIV, STDs, or BBIs in 3 1 prefectures in the four target provinces (Fujian, Guangxi, Shanxi,
and Xinjiang), it is expected that effective dissemination of successful strategies and practices developed in
the project provinces will significantly strengthen the capacity of the Central level to oversee the prevention
and control of these diseases, thereby benefiting the whole country. The reported cases of HIV in the four
project provinces are nearly 2,000 but the real numbers are estimated at ten times higher. The reported
cumulative STDs cases were 218,089 since 1993. Considerable benefits will be realized for those
households and families which do not become infected with or can be successfully treated for
HIV/AIDS/STDs. The international research findings documented in the recently published World Bank
book, Confronting AIDS: Public Priorities in a Global Epidemic, 1998, show that these benefits can be
considerable.
3.3   In addition to those already infected with HIV/AIDS/STDs and other BBIs, many people are at
risk of infection, especially those who engage in high risk behavior such as intravenous drug use, use or
provide commercial sex. Commercial blood and plasma donors have also infected or placed at risk
patients, through unsafe blood or plasma collection practices. This population size varies from province to
province as the modes of transmission differ in each province, but it is likely that, at a minimum, one to two
percent of the population in these four provinces are at risk of HIV/STDs, amounting to 1.3 to 2.6 million
persons. In addition, to the extent that a number of persons involved in inter-provincial or international
trade within the borders of the four provinces have high risk behaviors, they will also be direct
beneficiaries. Since there are many internal migrants within China today, especially to the provinces of
Fujian, Guangxi, and Xinjiang, this target population could amount to additional millions of persons. The
ultimate impact of the prevention program, and the replication of successful models of intervention, is
expected to reach the general population, far beyond the targeted high-risk populations.
3.4    The blood transfusion services subcomponent would contribute to help the Government make
dramatic changes in the collection, handling, and use of blood in medical care. The present collection is
overwhelmingly through mandatory and commercial methods, which the Government wants change in favor
of voluntary methods, and the magnitude of blood product use in medical care in China is considered to be
too high, which the Governnent wants to rationalize. The most direct beneficiaries of improved
management of blood transfusion services under the project are those who obtain blood products during the
treatment of their health problem(s), at the risk of transmission of BBIs, including hepatitis and HIV. Since
HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and many other infections can be transmitted via untested blood, and
since the cases of AIDS in Shanxi Province (and to a lesser extent Xinjiang Province) were infected by

China                                                                      Health Nine Project
unsafe blood collection practices, the most direct beneficiaries would be those residing in those two
localities. Improved blood supply will directly benefit women in the project areas by addressing the
number one cause of maternal mortality and morbidity, which is post-partum hemorrhage. As project
experience spreads, residents of other provinces will also become beneficiaries, especially where there is a
significant share of blood donated from commercial donors.
3.5    There are seven main institutional benefits of the project. First, the MHCD Component will help
to increase public resource allocation for basic preventative health services. Second, it will introduce an
improved health workers training program. Third, it will introduce improved management practices into
the system of maternal and neonatal care. Fourth, it will introduce participatory methodology for the
development of health education materials, counseling, and communications strategies, which will also
strengthen program evaluation. The HIV/AIDS/STDs Component will strengthen central and provincial
government capacity to plan and implement effective programs to prevent and control these diseases. Fifth,
improved management of blood transfusion services will develop effective national policies to improve the
collection, quality, and use of blood products. Sixth, it will also strengthen provincial and local efforts to
rationalize blood products use in health service provision. Finally, the national HIV/AIDS laboratory will
develop irnproved testing methods and procedures to improve HIV testing accuracy and train provincial and
local personnel in implementing them.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
4.1   Implementation. The project will be implemented over six years, beginning in early FY00. The
Ministry of Health (MOH) will be responsible for overall coordination of project implementation and
conduct of national level activities. MOH has established a Project Leading Group chaired by the Minister
of Health with representatives of the MOH Foreign Loan Office (FLO) and the Departments of Maternal
and Child Health (MCH), Disease Control (DCD), Medical Administration (MAD), and Finance and
Planning. FLO will act as secretariat of the Leading Group, coordinate project management, and hold
responsibility for reporting requirements. The responsibility for technical coordination and direct
supervision of implementation will lie with MOH departments, including MCH, DCD, and MAD. For
each of the MHCD and HIV/AIDS/STD Components of the Project, MOH has also established one
technical group for regular coordination and guidance of project implementation activities, one project
implementation office responsible for day-to-day project work, and one panel of experts to provide
technical guidance and review annual plans under the respective parts of the project.
4.2    Most project activities are expected to be implemented in the provinces and the counties. Their
management and coordination will be the responsibility of the provincial government, primarily through the
provincial bureau of health (BOH), under the guidance of FLO/MOH, and with institutional arrangements
similar to that of the Center. Each participating health bureau will maintain a project office, under the
direction of the Project Director, to handle the logistics of implementation, including procurement and
disbursement, preparation of workplans, progress monitoring and reporting, coordination with the expert
and leading groups, and other tasks as needed. Following the pattern of higher levels, project
implementation in the counties is the responsibility of the bureau of health, with guidance from provincial
level and from the county leading group.
4.3    Financial management. (See Annex 6 for detailed description). As for other Bank supported
health projects, financial management will be the responsibility of the project units, the projects offices in
MOH and BOH at each level, and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Finance Bureau (FB) at each level.
There will be five Special Accounts for the project located in commercial banks acceptable to the Bank,
and managed by MOF: one for Component A and Component C; and one for each province under
Component B. The internal disbursement procedures will involve the Project Management Offices (PMOs)

China                                                                      Health Nine Project
and FBs at each level. Separate project accounts will be kept in the project units and offices at each level.
Each project unit and project office will prepare regular financial reports to submit to the higher level
project office. FLO will consolidate provincial reports and prepare the final financial report for the whole
project. The project accounts and financial reports will be audited by the State Audit Admninistration or its
local offices, in accordance with standard practice in China, which has been found acceptable to the Bank.
4.4    Procurement and disbursement. (See Annex 6 for detailed description). FLO will oversee
project procurement and will be responsible to ensure that the Bank Guidelines are followed. Details of the
procurement arrangements are provided in Annex 6. The project will use the same arrangement as in other
health projects for submission and validation of claims through the project office at each level, with review
by the BOF at each level before being passed to the level above. Funds are transferred from level to level
through commercial banks nominated by the BOF at each level.
4.5    Monitoring and supervision. Two Project Inplementation Plans (PIPs) have been prepared by
and agreed with MOH and the provinces, which detail implementation arrangements. The project will be
monitored through twice yearly progress reports containing essential data on the implementation of the
project components and project management. Baseline data for the project monitoring indicators will be
collected and reported by June 1999, and then included in the regular progress reports. This monitoring
will be supplemented by supervision visits, conferences, and progress reviews led by the Central level.
Achievement of development objectives will be assessed through a Mid-term Evaluation scheduled for
2002, and through a project completion review jointly produced by the Borrower and the Bank.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
1.1    MCH service improvement without program to improve access. The main rationale for this
component was to help the Government accelerate the replication of the successful experience under the
Health VI Project to additional areas with poorest population. There was a question whether access
improvement measures should be left out of the project for the sake of simplicity. However, based on the
results of the Functional Coordination Study and the Mid-term Evaluation carried out under the Health VI
Project, the technical team felt that the objectives of reaching the poorest families would not be realized
without assistance to improve their affordability. Therefore, it was felt that project preparation should
proceed to include access improvement measures already tested under the Health VI Project.
1.2    HlV/AIDS/STDs prevention and control mainly through information, education and
communication (IEC). There was a proposal to focus mainly on IEC activities on the grounds that
HIV/AIDS/STDs were not yet very severe in China. This was rejected because, to avoid an impending
crisis as evidenced by recent years' rates of spread, it was felt important to also implement all other aspects
of a successful prevention and control program with full-scale multi-sectoral involvement.
1.3    HlV/AIDS/STDs prevention and control throus-h Government agencies only. There was a
proposal that prevention and control of these diseases should only be handled by government agencies.
This was rejected on two grounds. First, private practitioners were already treating a very large number of
STD patients in China, reportedly larger numbers than the government clinics in many areas. Many
patients prefer to avoid Government clinics but would not mind visiting private practitioners. Including
private practitioners in the progran would help improve their skills and establish an appropriate
surveillance program. Second, although not very significant in China at this time, non-governnent
agencies have the potential to be even more effective in reaching high-risk groups.

China                                                                      Health Nine Project
3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The main lessons learned from previous projects are summarized below.
3.1    The Comprehensive MCH Project (Cr. 2655-CHA: Health VI) has demonstrated that a carefully
selected package to improve MCH services and increase access can result in dramatic reduction in maternal
and child mortality and morbidity. In addition to improving training for health workers and providing basic
equipment and additional management resources, under this project China piloted public funding of
measures to improve financial access for the very poor, using an earmarked fund and a carefully designed
benefits package, with defined standards for services eligible for reimbursement. This link between service
quality and provider payment has proved to be an important tool for improving care and containing costs,
and will be used in the new project.
3.2    The Disease Prevention Project (Cr. 2794-CHA: Health VII), which is currently implementing
smaller programs for the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS/STDs, has provided a number of lessons
toward the development of the H[V/AIDS/STDs Component in this project. Main models came from the
design of the behavior risk surveillance, for the policies toward the private practitioners of STD care,
outreach for sex workers, and the design of the community-based interventions.
3.3   Previous experience in the implementation of Bank supported health projects in China confirms the
high level of commitment and ownership of the project by local governments and health bureaus, and the
strong motivation for success. But the experience also highlights difficulties faced by implementing units in
poor and remote counties, due to their own shortage of resources and to constraints imposed by Bank and
government procedures applied through four or five administrative levels. These difficulties include: (a)
late or inadequate mobilization of counterpart funds; (b) slow fund flow from higher levels (including Bank
reimbursement) to county and township implementing units; and (c) some dissatisfaction with the costs,
delays, and rigidity in obtaining equipment for low level health facilities through large procurement
packages at national level. This project's implementation, management, and reporting arrangements will
address these issues.
4. Indications of Borrower commitment and ownership:
4.1    The level of Borrower commitment is evident from the long-standing attention paid to the project
by the core central agencies, the high level of involvement of participating provinces and counties in the
steps of preparation, preparation by the Borrower of the PIPs, financial commitments made by the
participating provinces before appraisal, and readiness to commence activities which are eligible for
retroactive financing. In each project province, the project proposal was prepared based on individual
counties' contributions and with their full participation. Each of the four workshops held between the Bank
missions and the clients included representatives of planning, finance and health bureaus of each of the
eight project provinces included under the two components, in which their participation was enthusiastic
and supportive.
4.2    China's commitment to improve the population's basic and preventive health, especially maternal
and child health, has always been well-known. The Government's resolve to confront the problems of
HIV/AIDS was amply demonstrated during the international donors' conference, held in Beijing in
November 1997, in which the Government openly addressed issues of concern, and requested international
assistance.

5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
5.1    While the project is based on the Government's concept and policy priorities, the Bank's support
has numerous benefits. Bank involvement affords three important contributions: (a) technical expertise
and inputs; (b) policy backing and promotion; and (c) possibility of large investment and experience with
large, integrated health projects. First, the Bank's worldwide experience helps bring the best international
technical practices to China in both maternal and child health and in the prevention and control of
HIV/AIDS/STDs. This aspect of the Bank relationship is valued most by China's health officials. Second,
the Bank can be most effective in raising national awareness, commitment, and policy improvements that
are required to implement early child development activities, and prevent and control H1V/AIDS/STDs. It
is also essential to carefully handle China's sensitivity on HIV/AIDS/STDs issues with mutual trust, which
the Bank is capable of doing because of the excellent current relationship. Third, China has implemented a
large number of very small activities through other external agencies to control HIV/AIDS/STDs.
However, the HIV/AIDS problem is complex and exponentially greater given the country's size, and China
now needs a large-scale integrated program. In addition, China requires external technical assistance
working in close coordination in a number areas. The proposed IBRD/IDA blend of lending can also help
finance any equipment need, and the technical assistance can be financed from the project as well as from
other sources that are expected to join in the Bank's efforts.
E: Summary Project Analysis (detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (see Annex 4 for a detailed analysis):
1.1    The economic analysis covers the following: (a) linkage to the CAS; (b) benefits and target
population; (c) rationale for public sector investment in the project; (d) benefit-cost and cost-effectiveness
analysis; and (e) poverty assessment. The project's three main components are estimated to have a
potential internal rate of return (IRR) of a minimum of 39 percent for the benefits derived from the MHCD
Component, at least 36 percent for the HIV/AIDS/STDs Component, and at least 5,000 percent for the
blood transfusion services subcomponent. It is estimated that all three components are highly cost-effective
relative to many other intemationally investigated health sector investment options.
2. Financial (see Annex 5 for a detailed analysis):
2.1    The financial analysis covers the assessment of (a) Affordability and Sustainability, and (b)
Financial Management. Financial reporting arrangements are in Annex 6.
3. Technical:
3.1    Attention has been given to ensure that the technical design follows the established intemational
best practices adapted for the specific needs of China's conditions. The MHCD Component follows the
approach successfully applied in the ongoing Health VI Project, which was developed following the model
under the programns supported by UNICEF, WHO and UNFPA. Special attention was paid to ensure that
the case management protocols complied with the most appropriate practices recommended by WHO and
UNICEF and adapted for China. The design of the HIV/AIDS/STDs Component has been based on the
well-accepted successful intemational experience suitably adapted for the conditions prevailing in China.
The experience gained under the pilot activities implemented in the Health VII Project provided important
insights for the technical design. Finally, the blood transfusion services subcomponent has emphasized
increasing voluntary collections of blood since current practice of heavy dependence on mandatory or paid
collection was not considered appropriate. Similarly, the best international practices were considered and
used to design the improvements in the handling of blood.

China                                                                        Health Nine Project
4. Institutional:
4.1    Borrowing Agencies. The Ministry of Finance and provincial bureaus of finance are well
experienced in the use of Bank funds in investment projects, have taken an active role in project
preparation, and have the competence to manage project special accounts and related responsibilities.
Although the recent reorganization and staff reductions have strained MOF's coordination and overseeing
capacity, MOF has assured continued adequate support. The Ministry of Health has over 15 years of
successful experience in preparing and supervising the implementation of Bank supported projects. In
1997, the Bank's Quality Assurance Group cited the Comprehensive MCH Project (Cr. 2655-CHA) as an
example of outstanding project supervision, which is, in part, a testament to this capability. All provinces
participating in this project, as well as many project counties, have previous experience of implementing
Bank supported health projects.
4.2    The main challenges or risks to successful and timely project implementation of the MHCD
Component would be inadequate supervision of the project activities especially at the lower levels and in
the most remote areas. Early implementation of the management training subcomponent at the county
levels should reduce such risks. On the HIV/AIDS/STDs Component, the main constraint could be
inadequate commitment and leadership from the high-level officials and insufficient inter-sectoral
coordination. This concern should continue to receive high attention from the Bank and the Central
Ministries.
5. Social:
5.1    A social assessment and stakeholder analysis have been integrated into both the preparation and
design of both project components, MHCD and HIV/AIDS/STDs, with particular attention to the following
social aspects.
5.2    First, for the MHCD Component, project activities have been targeted to the poorest counties in the
project provinces, which were primarily selected based on their poverty index, using national and provincial
poverty data. Women and children will be the major beneficiaries. For the HIV/AIDS/STDs Component,
project activities have been targeted to the high-risk populations for these diseases in the project provinces,
who would be the primary beneficiaries. Eventual benefits would also accrue to residents of other areas as
the project experience spreads.
5.3    Second, a social inquiry of health issues was conducted, combining a baseline survey of local traits
(demographic, social, cultural, and ethnic factors) with an assessment of income, health care status, and
accessibility to health care facilities. Third, the participatory approach adopted for preparation of other
Bank supported China health projects has been applied and strengthened, to effectively target the poor,
appropriately design project activities, and effectively provide incentives for beneficiary performance. For
the MHCD Component, a problem-oriented, strategic planning approach has been followed which aims at
addressing the needs of villages and families in the project proposals. Under the HIV/AIDS/STDs
Component, involvement has been maximized of social organizations, NGOs, and other relevant groups in
project preparation and implementation. Stakeholder consultation and participation have been detailed in
the project proposals and are summarized below. Fourth, the project includes a comprehensive sample
survey of project beneficiaries (conducted at the start, mid-term, and close of the project) to systematically
monitor project impact on local public health.
5.4    Minority nationalities in the project areas. National minorities make up approximately six
percent of China's total population, but the needs and concerns of minority nationalities have been
identified as a specific topic of the social assessment and minorities have been identified as specific

stakeholders during project preparation. The proportion of minority nationalities is particularly high in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. To the extent that members of these minority nationalities are
represented among the very poor in the project counties, they will particularly benefit from project
initiatives. Issues of concern to minorities will continue to be monitored and addressed through the
participatory aspect of project implementation. The inclusion of "nationality" as a specific data variable in
the project survey instruments for baseline, mid-term, and project completion assessment, will enable
comprehensive and comparative analysis of issues for minority nationalities. In summary, the project has
been designed to ensure that the minority nationalities in the project areas fully benefit from the project in
accordance with O.D. 4.20.'
5.5    Resettlement. No resettlement is anticipated in the project or as a consequence of the project.
However, in case any new land acquisition is found necessary during project implementation, a set of
resettlement guidelines was agreed during the negotiations, following recent practices.
6. Environmental assessment: Environmental Category [C].
The project is expected to have no adverse environmental impact. Attention will be given to issues
of disposal of medical waste and use of energy saving technology.
6.1    Medical waste. Medical waste hazards in small health facilities are not generally of high volume
or toxicity. All facilities will collect and dispose of medical waste, including needles and syringes,
separately from household waste, and in accordance with WHO's recommended policy and the national
infection control procedures.
6.2    Energy saving. Energy saving stoves are now available in China and will be introduced into the
health facilities improved by the project. Solar water heaters will be introduced in those areas where the
technology is known.
7. Participatory approach:
7.1    MOH and the project provinces have conducted consultation with a range of stakeholders at each
adlministrative level, as well as exchange of views with other relevant groups. Apart from many health
institutions and agencies, the sectors consulted included planning, finance, poverty alleviation, education,
women's association, and international public health agencies such as UNAIDS. Targeted community
consultation and participation have been intensively carried out in both project components. In the MHCD
Component, selected families and villages have been mobilized in a process of consultation and feedback
for project activity planning, and will participate in extensive education and training programs during
project implementation. Under the HIV/AIDS/STDs Component, project design includes community
intervention in project areas and high-risk groups. Moreover, all relevant sectors have been involved in
intervention activities, including social organizations, NGOs, local governments, public security, schools,
entertainment places, as well as AIDS prevention associations.
3For this project, the tenn "ethnic minorities" as used in O.D. 4.20 has the same meaning as the term "Minority
Nationalities" referred to in the Chinese Constitution.

F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
1.1   Institutional sustainabilitv. The main emphases of the project are on the methods and the best
practices to accomplish those activities that are already a high priority for the Central as well as for the
local levels in the project areas. To ensure lasting effects, the project focuses on policy development,
institutional strengthening, technical assistance, and training, instead of hardware items. It is unlikely that
the project will suffer from a lack of continued interest or the inability to maintain and further improve on
the practices and technical know-how introduced and further strengthened by the project.
1.2    Financial Sustainabilitv. The financing of implementation and maintenance of project activities
will require significant increases in the budgetary resources from the provincial and county levels, but these
requirements are small and quite affordable compared to present budgetary allocations, and the growth-
trends of the concerned entities' budgets.
2. Critical risks (reflecting assumptions in the fourth column of Annex 1):
1. Failure to provide necessary   S        This has been a chronic risk in all health projects in

To minimize this risk, the project design takes this into
account and allocates appropriate levels of counterpart
funding.

Overall Risk Rating:            M       I____________________
Risk Rating - H (High Risk), S (Substantial Risk), M (Modest Risk), N (Negligible or Low Risk).
3. Possible controversial aspects:
3.1   The blood supply may fall to critical levels during the transition phase between the current paid
donors program and a truly voluntary unpaid donor program, due to a decline in paid donations and a slow
rate of increase in voluntary donation. This risk is being managed by prioritizing development of the
voluntary blood programn and providing adequate resourcing. There will be a phasing of the introduction of
the volunteer program and in these ways it is hoped to minimize the risk.
3.2   If early in this project more blood components are processed before the assurance that there is a
safe blood supply and these components are transfused without strict clinical guidelines, then an increase in
the transmission of all blood borne infections, including HIV/AIDS, is a likely outcome. This risk is being
managed by strict regulations on the funding for this part of the project.

Project Description
The project has two main components, which are described in this annex. Component A, Improved
Maternal Health and Child Development, or MHCD Component, will be implemented in a total of 113
counties in five provinces, covering 51 million people: Guizhou, Hainan, Hunan, Jilin, and Xinjiang.
Component B, Improved Prevention and Control of Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome and Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Other Blood Bome Infections, or
HIV/AIDS/STDs Component, includes 31 prefectures, covering 94 million people in four provinces:
Fujian, Guangxi, Shanxi, and Xinjiang. Will be implemented in 31 out of
INTRODUCTION
1.    The objectives of the project are to assist the Government to reduce maternal and child mortality
and morbidity and improve child survival and development in the poorest areas of China, and to prevent
and control the spread of HIV/AIDS/STDs and other blood borne infections in selected counties by
implementing comprehensive and multi-sectoral public health programs at the provincial levels, and by
building technical capacity at the Central level. This would be achieved through:
-  improved quality of basic MHCD care services.
-  improved family and community participation and education.
*  improved management of MCH services.
*  improved health workers' training.
*  improved access to MCH care services, especially for the poor.
*  improved and expanded HIV/AIDS/STDs policies.
*  improved HIV/AIDS/STDs interventions and support.
*  effective surveillance of HIV/AIDS/STDs.
*  improved collection, handling, and use of safe blood for essential medical care.
2.    The project design incorporates the following features:
*  MCH project activities in each county will involve families and communities as equal partners
with health workers to use participatory methods to gather information for the development of
health education materials and strategies. They will be targeted at removing the resource,
knowledge, and cultural barriers to appropriate use of services by poor women and children,
communities, groups, and individual at greatest risk.
*  MCH project training activities will introduce the approach of systematic management of sick
children, and the risk approach in maternal and neonatal care. Management training will
introduce health workers to methods for problem solving, supervision, and quality of care
assessment using the management information system (MIS).
*  HIV/AIDS/STDs project activities in each province will be implemented through the private,
public, and NGO sectors.
*  HIV/AIDS/STDs project activities will be targeted at reducing high risk behaviors and
educating the general public.
*  each participating province or county has the flexibility to select HIV/AIDS/STDs
interventions based on the local epidemic and priorities.

and coordination of MCH services; (b) improve the quantity and quality of supervisory support between
levels; and (c) improve the function and use of the existing management information and surveillance
systems for MCH. These objectives will be accomplished by strengthening management training in the
principles of management and the knowledge and understanding of the different tools and methods for
management problem solving and quality of care assessment, in large part through a strengthened
management information system.
10.   The project will finance: (a) further adaptation and development of existing management training
materials for provincial and county levels; (b) costs of printing management training materials and
management forms; (c) development, evaluation, printing, and distribution of guidelines and manuals for
supervision; (d) expert group review, including meetings of management procedures and the management
information system; (e) training of trainers; (f) county management training; (g) an expert group to examine

MCH care by establishing a system of regular refresher training that can be sustained and replicated by the
project provinces. Training activities are divided into short term (about one week) and longer-term (three
to six months) courses and focus on improving health service skills, especially MCH skills and various
aspects of management. Comprehensive packages of teaching, learning, reference, and assessment
materials would be developed, building on the experience of earlier programs in China, notably the World
Bank's Comprehensive MCH Project (Cr. 2655-CHA), and the China "300 counties Project" supported by
UNICEF, WHO, and UNFPA.
12.   The project will finance: (a) printing of existing materials; (b) revision or new development and
production of training materials; (c) translation of the materials to various ethnic languages; (d) operational
costs of the training courses; (e) limited rehabilitation and expansion of the county-level training facilities

Annex 2
A5.   Improved Access to MCH Care Services
13.   This subcomponent will provide a program of poverty relief funds for the very poor. The purpose
of these funds is to develop and implement a program of medical financial assistance in each project
county, to cover part of the costs of providing to the poorest families selected health services that reduce
the risks of maternal and child mortality, serious morbidity from the complications of pregnancy and
delivery, and the common causes of child mortality and disability.
14.   Activities include identifying eligible populations, a basic package of services to be covered, the
range of subsidies and copayment, sources of funds, operational standards, reimbursement, accounting, and
audit procedures. The eligible services would include: (a) a MCH package of prenatal, hospital delivery,
post-natal visits, childhood immunizations and Tetanus Toxoid for pregnant women, and outpatient care
for common illnesses of under-five year olds; and (b) about 70 percent of the costs of services and drugs
provided at the village level, 65 percent of outpatient and inpatient costs at the township level, and 60
percent of the costs at the county level.
15.   The project will fund the establishment of poverty relief funds program management, monitoring,
and coordination at township and county levels, including staff training and supervision. It will also pay
for the service subsidies provided by thll poverty relief funds.
Component B. Improved Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS/STDs and Other Blood Borne
Infections (total base cost US$27.17 million) comprises four subcomponents, which will prevent and
control these diseases by implementing comprehensive and multi-sectoral public health programs at the
provincial levels, and by building technical capacity at the Central level.
B1.   Improved and Expanded Policy Environment
16.   The purpose of this subcomponent is to provide leadership for a multi-sectoral approach to prevent
and control the spread of HIV/AIDS/STDs. This will be achieved through institutional building and
development of specific policies at the central and provincial levels. This subcomponent will: (a) raise
awareness and commitment at all levels; (b) strengthen multi-sectoral collaboration; (c) build capacity of
public and private sectors and NGOs; (d) integrate HlV/AIDS/STDs and other blood borne infections
programs into other health services; and (e) support policies on syndromic management of STDs, blood
safety, condom social marketing, floating (or migrant) populations, and discrimination against AIDS
patients.

innovative and cost-effective programs in public and community settings that are designed to prevent and
control HIV/AIDS/STDs, and create a supportive environment for people with H[V/AIDS/STDs. The
interventions will be targeted toward changing the behavior of those at highest risk for HIV and will be
supported by information and education of the general public to increase their knowledge about risks. The
subcomponent will also focus on improved STDs management, condom social marketing, and patient care
and support.
19.   The project will finance mass media campaigns, training, equipment, materials, study tours,
behavior change interventions, and development and expansion of syndromic management for STDs.
B3.   Improved HIV/AIDS/STDs Surveillance System
20.    This subcomponent will develop and expand a surveillance system to monitor HIV/AIDS/STDs
epidemic and behavioral trends, influence policy, inform project design, and measure the impact of the
interventions. This subcomponent will support: (a) sentinel seroprevalence surveys; (b) HIV and STDs
case reporting; (c) behavioral surveillance surveys; and (d) improved surveillance of STDs etiology and
antibiotic sensitivity.
21.    The project will finance HIV and STD testing, laboratory equipment, sero and behavioral surveys,
training, and study tours.
B4.   Improved Management of Blood Transfusion Services
22.    An efficient and effective blood transfusion services system is requisite to provide a safe and
sustainable supply of blood for clinically essential transfusions, thereby reducing the risk of transmission of
blood borne infections, and reducing maternal morbidity and mortality. This will be achieved by the
following main activities: (a) establishing a program of voluntary unpaid blood donation of sufficient size
to meet clinical needs as defined by guidelines on clinical transfusion practice; (b) providing sufficient staff
and material resources to support the voluntary blood donation program; (c) implementing an effective
program of quality assurance for blood testing, processing, storage and delivery; (d) developing,
disseminating, and promoting the use of clinical guidelines for good transfusion practice by clinicians to
avoid inappropriate transfusion of blood and blood components; and (e) providing the necessary training of
blood service and clinical staff.
23.   In the project provinces, the project will fund essential additional staff, training, medical supplies
(drug reagents), and material resources to support the existing activities to expand the voluntary donation
program and develop a quality assured blood supply system. Vehicles are essential to the community based
donation program, and essential, specialized vehicles will be provided to meet program objectives.
Similarly, appropriate vehicles in sufficient numbers are essential if blood is to be supplied to meet clinical
needs in hospitals served by the provincial blood centers and regional blood stations. In accordance with
these objectives and priorities, the project will fund equipment items and vehicles for which there is a
demonstrated need. The project will not fund equipment for further expansion of the separation of blood
into its components (red cells, plasma, and platelets).

Component C. Project Coordination and Support (total base cost US$6.00 million).
24.    Through this component the national level agencies will: (a) develop and implement policies
necessary to achieve the project objectives; (b) provide necessary coordination and support to the provinces
to plan, supervise, monitor and report on project progress; (c) facilitate and provide technical assistance to
the provinces; (d) implement research and other activities best suited for implementation at the Central
level, including operational research on MCH service financing for the poorest families and MCH service
utilization; and (e) replicate successful practices to non-project areas. The project will support the
establishment of a National AIDS Reference Laboratory (NARL) to offer technical support to HIV testing
and surveillance activities and provide guidance in HIV testing and management, monitor and supervise
HIV testing laboratories, and evaluate IRV diagnostic tests in use in the country. The NARL will also
build the capacity to monitor H1V viral types and variants in the country.
25.    These national level activities will be carried out under the overall coordination of the Project
Leading Group assisted by the project units and technical units to be established in the Ministry of Health
in a manner acceptable to the Bank. Detailed outlines for the activities of Component C are provided in the
PIPs for the project and are also available in the project files. The PIPs also cover all activities of project
management by the Foreign Loan Office of MOH and the project implementing units in the provincial
health bureaus.

Economic Analysis
Introduction
The economic analysis covers the following: (a) linkage to the CAS; (b) benefits and target
population; (c) rationale for public sector investment in the project's three components; (d) alternatives,
benefit-cost, and cost-effectiveness analysis of each component; and (e) poverty assessment. The project's
three components are estimated to have a potential Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of a minimum of 39
percent for the benefits derived from the MHCD Component, at least 36 percent for the HIV/AIDS/STDs
Component, and at least 5,000 percent for the blood transfusion services subcomponent. It is estimated
that all three sub/components are highly cost-effective relative to many other internationally investigated
health sector investment options, with the MHCD Component saving a DALY for about RMB 20.
Corresponding estimates of the cost per DALY saved shows the HlV/AIDS/STDs Component saving a
DALY between RMB 164 and RMB 139 and the blood transfusion services subcomponent spending RMB
181 per DALY saved. A more in-depth statement of these and other findings are in the project's files.
1.    Linkage with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
1.1   The project is fully consistent with the goals and priorities of the CAS, both to improve the human
capital of the country by improving health status, and by reducing the negative effects of poverty by
improving maternal and child health status. The MHCD Component replicates the China Health VI Project
in 113 additional low-income counties in five rural and low-income provinces, covering nearly 51 million
persons. In the most recent CAS (1997) and the 1998 CAS progress report, concern focussed on using
scarce public resources to improve human development in a cost-effective manner and target public funds
to address the welfare of the most impoverished areas of the country. This project will extend the success
of the Health VI Project, which has reduced the MMR and IMR in most of the poorest counties in the nine
project provinces by the Mid-term Evaluation by about 50 percent in both cases.
1.2   The control of the emerging HIV epidemic is also a high priority outlined in the CAS and CAS
progress report, and can contribute to the further high rate of economic growth by protecting the further
spread of the epidemic into the mainstream population. The project will test intervention strategies which
have worked in many other international settings in four provinces, which, until now, have experienced
different epidemiological patterns of spread of HIV and STDs. This experience will then be used to
develop a future national intervention program. Since the epidemic also tends to concentrate in the poorest
groups, the project will also contribute to poverty reduction over time.
1.3   Finally, the project will invest funds to improve the management of the blood banking system in
China. In part, this investment comprises one well tested method of preventing the spread of HIV and other
STDs through the blood banking system. In addition, it has many other potential benefits as well, most
notably the first major action to move toward voluntary collection of blood, improvement in the processing
and use of the blood in medicine.
2.    Benefits and Target Population
2.1    Through the MHCD Component, the project will most directly benefit about one million mothers
and their infants born each year in 113 poorest counties located in five relatively poor provinces in China



Project Appraisal Document                                                           Page 38
China                                                                        Health Nine Project
Annex 4
(Guizhou, Hainan, Hunan, Jilin, and Xinjiang), with higher quality and greater access to health services,
which have been tested and well known in China to contribute to reductions in maternal and infant
mortality. The young (under five years of age) brothers and sisters of these children will also benefit by
reductions in the under five mortality rate (U5 MR) and from improved nutrition education, parenting, and
child development skills so the psychosocial development of young children is enhanced. The findings of
the recently completed Mid-term Evaluation of China's Health VI Project (MCH focussed) demonstrated
the feasibility of these achievements even in the poor counties of eight poor provinces.
2.2   In addition to these health status benefits, the households, which directly realize the mortality
reductions, will also benefit in the following ways: (a) enhancing economic productivity of the families by
saving the lives of adult women; (b) ensuring the continuation of non-market produced household goods
and services; and (c) reducing medical care costs for MCH related services (especially hospital delivery
care) for the most impoverished families in these poor counties via the locally administered poverty relief
funds.
2.3    The HIV/AIDS/STDs Component will directly benefit those persons who are at greatest risk of
contracting a STD or HIV (those involved in drug use, commercial sex, or are commercial blood donors).
In the four project provinces (Fujian, Guangxi, Shanxi, and Xinjiang), these high risk groups comprise
about two million persons. In these four provinces those who stand most to benefit are those already
afflicted with HIV (there are nearly 2,000 reported cases and perhaps as many as 20 thousand, estimated
via WHO procedures) and STDs (reported cumulative cases are 218,089 since 1993). They will directly
benefit by the provision of high quality treatrnent for those STDs or by controlling secondary infections
such as TB.
2.4    As this project matures and models for addressing the STD problem in China are tested, the entire
population of the country could benefit from the initiated activities. This is especially true for those
measures taken to reduce the further spread of STDs as they also reduce the probability of spreading HIV.
The benefits defined in paragraph 2.2 above are likely to yield considerable benefits to those households
and families which do not become afflicted with or can be successfully treated for a STI, especially
HIV/AIDS. The international research findings documented in the recently published World Bank book,
Confronting AIDS: Public Priorities in a Global Epidemic, 1998, demonstrate how considerable these
benefits can be.
2.5    The primary beneficiaries of improved management of blood transfusion services are all of those
persons who require blood products as a part of their health care treatment (in 1993 nearly 50 million
persons were hospitalized for care). The risk of blood borne infection transmission of hepatitis would be
significantly reduced. In addition, since HIV/AIDS can be transmitted via untested blood and since the
epidemic in Shanxi Province (and to a lessor extent Xinjiang Province) is most directly linked to tainted
blood supplies, direct project beneficiaries include those who reside in those provinces.
2.6    Finally, there are seven main institutional benefits of the project. First, the MHCD Component
will help increase public resource allocation for basic preventative health services. Second, it will
introduce an improved training program for health care workers. Third, improved management practices
will be introduced into the public delivery of preventive health services. Fourth, the HIV/AIDS/STDs
Component will strengthen the capacity of the central and provincial governments to plan and implement
effective programs to prevent and control these serious diseases. Fifth, the blood transfusion services
subcomponent will develop effective national policies to improve the quality of blood products used in the
country. Sixth, it will also strengthen the capacity of provincial and local personnel in rationalizing the use

China                                                                        Health Nine Project
Annex 4
of blood products in health service provision. Finally, the national HIV/AIDS laboratory will develop
improved testing methods and procedures to improve the accuracy of HIV tests and train provincial and
local personnel in how to implement them.
3.     Rationale for Public Sector Investment in the Project
3.1    The two primary reasons for public intervention into the Chinese health sector to enhance MCH
services and mitigate the HIV/AIDS/STDs epidemics are the existence of: (a) market failures; and (b)
negative externalities. The primary market failure is a lack of consumer knowledge regarding the
importance and potential availability of interventions which can improve MCH status, and reduce the
practice of risky sexual practices and transmission of blood borne infections. The primary negative
externality is related to the spread of infectious STDs such as H[V.
3.2   In addition, there are equity (merit want) reasons for supporting public intervention where the
health problems are concentrated in poor income areas, as is the case with high rates of maternal and infant
death. Further, since the stigma of the label of "HIV positive" can lead to adverse human rights and other
welfare consequences for those afflicted, there is an equity rationale for public intervention, irrespective of
how an individual may have become infected with HIV.
3.3    Finally, as the blood transfusion services and HIV national laboratory subcomponents lead to an
enhancement of the quality of all health care service delivery through a process of applied research in each
area, public investment is justified on the basis of the public good attributes of research. For the blood
transfusion services subcomponent, a further justification is based on the reduction in the negative
externalities transmitted via poor quality blood. This justification has been the primary rationale used in
other Bank funded projects investing in improvements in the blood supply.
4.     Benefit-Cost and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Project Components
4.1   (A full explanation of all calculations along with Summary Tables is presented in a detailed project
document.) In terms of the alternative intervention options considered for each project component, the
MHCD Component follows the highly successful Health VI (MCH) Project being implemented in the poor
rural counties of eight provinces in China. It has attained highly successful results and implementation has
been performing well. The HIV/AIDS/STDs Component has been designed using high risk group
interventions which have been proven successful in many other intemational settings, and have been tested
in selective sites in China, for example, peer counseling and condom promotion among commercial sex
workers and their major clientele, and long distance truckers. The blood transfusion services
subcomponent is designed to address the dual problems of blood contamination and paid donor
contributions which is said to have a higher prevalence of STDs including HIV. A strategy is emerging for
seeking more volunteer donors.
4.2    MHCD Component. A partial Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) has been performed on this proposed
component on an ex-ante basis. A number of assumptions were made to conduct the analysis, including,
(a) two benefits were included in this assessment: (i) the annual productivity loss attributable to
women who lost their lives during child birth, with the productivity loss estimated to be equal
to the 1997 per capita annual income for the poor counties included in the project; and (ii) the
present value of children who needlessly die during the first year of life;
(b) the only assessed benefit was the annual productivity loss attributable to women who lost their

China                                                                        Health Nine Project
Annex 4
lives during child birtI, with the productivity loss estimated to be equal to the 1997 per capita
annual income for poor counties included in the project;'/
(c) per capita annual income is not assumed to grow during the project period;
(d) project costs are assumed to be incurred according to the disbursement schedule in the PIP,
Annex 12, for the first five year period, and subsequent to that recurrent costs of the MHCD
Component are assumed to equal RMB 25 million per year, based on the cost tables for the
project from which this figure was derived;
(e) the flow of benefits (in this case, maternal lives saved) is equal to the difference between the
expected number of maternal deaths resulting from the present MMR of 169 per one hundred
thousand persons and the revised number of maternal deaths based on reductions achievable
via the project; and
(f) achievable reductions in the MMR are based on the findings from the Mid-term Evaluation of
the Health VI Project, July 1998 draft), with a continuing trend of MMR reductions
throughout the ten year period.
4.3    The findings show that the IRR for these two project benefits, a minimum productivity benefit
derived from the lives of the mothers saved and 4.2 (b) above is about 39 percent. With other benefits
included, such as those derived from reducing IMR and U5MR to levels equivalent throughout China,
along with the many other benefits (see section 3 above), the project's IRR would be much higher. This is
true since the burden of disease lost from premature death of children is at least four times as large as that
lost from maternal death. Since the benefit stream calculated uses the average rural per capita income in
the poor counties where the project will be implemented, without any growth over ten years, that further
reduces the estimated flow of the expected benefits from this one benefit alone. Thus, it represents a
mininmum estimate. Further, if the benefit stream were assessed over a longer time period than ten years,
then the net present value for this project component would be greater, even accounting for the additional
recurrent costs incurred.
4.4   In conducting the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) for the MHCD Component, it was necessary
to make a number of assumptions. First, it assumes that the cost flow of the component is as presented in
Annex 10 of the PIP, and that subsequent to the project, recurrent cost flows to continue the interventions
will be on the order of RMB 25 million per year in the project supported counties. 2/ Second, it is assumed
that the trend in the reduction of the IMR, U5MR, and MMR achieved during the first three years of the
Health VI Project can also occur in the poor counties assisted by this project. It is also assumed that the
trend will continue throughout a ten year period. Third, it is assumed that the DALYs saved by the
reductions in the IMR, U5MR and MMR will occur according to a similar trend.
4.5    The findings of the analysis suggest that the ten year cost per DALY saved is about RMB 20.4
(US$2.46 at current foreign exchange rates). Over the first five project years during significant investment
costs, the cost per DALY saved is higher, around RMB 40.0 (US$4.83). For both the five and ten year
periods, the marginal cost per DALY saved is less than the average, around RMB 15 and RMB 7
respectively.
l Estimated from data contained in PIP/MCH, p. 10, Table 2.1, MOH, August 18, 1998.
2 The figure of RMB 25 million per year is equivalent to about RMB 0.45 per capita in the poorest counties of the
project.

4.6    These figures suggest that the proposed investment in MCH improvement in poor rural areas of
China today is highly cost-effective relative to many other possible investments, though not the most cost-
effective. In China during the mid-1990s, when immunization coverage was lower, for one RMB, as many
as 1,386 DALYs could be saved from increasing immunization coverage of BCG, 1,204 DALYs for
extending Hepatitis B coverage, 182 DALYs for expanding neo-natal tetanus, and 35 DALYs for
increasing measles coverage. Today, however, as immunization coverage for these diseases have become
very high, the DALYs saved from additional immunization efforts has dropped concomitantly. Thus, the
present cost-effectiveness ratio for immunization programs in China would be much higher.
4.7    The HIV/AIDS/STDs Component. An ex-ante BCA of this component has been conducted, in part
by employing a number of assumptions about the following issues, including the:
(a) course of the epidemic in the four project provinces over the next decade with and without the
epidemic;
(b) benefits and their corresponding value in monetary terms;
(c) expected recurrent cost of the project interventions after the period of initial project
investments; and
(d) period of evaluation is ten years.
4.8    To address the first issue, the analysis used available information from UNAIDS, MOH, and
provincial and MOH draft PIPs regarding the numbers of cases of HIV and AIDS nationally and
provincially. This information was subject to a set of internal checks for accuracy and then projections
were made, first nationally regarding the prevalence and incidence of HIV and AIDS cases. It was
assumed that an HIV case would turn into an AIDS case in eight years, and then the AIDS case would die
in one year, based on information from MOH and other knowledgeable individuals. Then an estimate was
made of the course of the epidemic in the four project provinces, with the national figures and prevalence
rates serving as guidelines.
4.9   It was assumed that the interventions might alter the course of the epidemic by effective
implementation to the extent that only 1.5 million Chinese might become HIV positive by 2010, rather than
10 million estimated from early projections made by WHO. They were then reviewed for their consistency,
and a median and low range estimate of the future course of the epidemic, with and without the
intervention, was then developed and used to estimate the numbers of cases of HIV and AIDS averted by
the project intervention. The lowest estimates were used in the final assessment of the benefits.
4.10   It was also required to assess the direct and indirect benefits of the cases of disease averted. Direct
benefits included the medical care for ItV and AIDS cases averted due to the fewer cases of the illness in
each year over a ten year assessment period. A similar benefit would also accrue for the treatment of other
STDs such as syphilis and gonorrhea, but nothing could be gleaned about case treatment costs. The
indirect benefits of foregone earnings of cases of HIV and AIDS averted were estimated, employing
assumptions about the following issues. First, what would be average earnings streams in the project
provinces (ten percent of Chinese average per capita income). Second, time horizons and their likely
growth over time. Third, the average age of being afflicted by HIV (25 years) and AIDS. Third, the
degree of disability from the IHV infection (from the Global Burden of Disease, Murray and Lopez, 1996)
and its impact on earnings over the eight years persons would continue to live. The present value of these
earning streams were then calculated on the basis of the assumptions made.
4.11   The findings, based on all of the above assumptions, show this component having an IRR of about

China                                                                       Health Nine Project
Annex 4
36 percent, assuming the lowest or most pessimistic values for all parameters. If by Mid-term Evaluation,
these interventions are working well, the country should consider making a much larger investment to
implement on a national scale.
4.12   Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the H1V/AIDS/STDs Component. A similar set of assumptions
were required for estimating the DALYs saved from averting H1V and other STDs, as was made in
estimating the HIV cases averted. In addition, an estimate of the number of DALYs saved from non-HIV
cases of STDs averted was also included in the assessment. This was because the envisioned prevention
programs for HIV within high risk populations tend to significantly reduce the incidence of other rapidly
increasing STDs such as syphilis and gonorrhea (e.g., condom promotion, and rapid treatrnent of STDs).
Also included in the estimate of DALYs saved from the proposed interventions was an estimate of non-HIV
related STD DALY savings. A conservative DALY estimate was made for every HIV related DALY
saved by averting HIV, an additional 0.25 STD related DALY would be saved from the reduction of the
incidence of STDs. Finally, while it is known that the growth of HIV has contributed to the rapid
expansion in the incidence of TB, it was unclear how to include the TB related DALY savings into this
assessment. Thus, the estimate of the cost per DALY saved may be higher than it might if the TB factor
was also included.
4.13   This analysis suggests that the STDs interventions in the four provinces costs between RMB 104
to RMB 139 (US$12.5 to US$16.8) per DALY saved. While this cost is higher than for the MCH
program interventions, it is much lower than many other possible preventive health programs in China. It
also has the added benefit of contributing to the containment of a potentially devastating epidemic, which
has cost many Sub-Saharan African countries up to one percent of per capita growth per year for the
foreseeable future. Since the epidemic is still relatively contained in China to high risk populations, the
potential benefits will not be as great as when the prevalence of the disease is as high as in other areas of
Asia and Africa.
4.14   Blood Management CBA. Blood in China is purchased and sold by individuals operating in a
government regulated market. The government dominates the buying and selling by serving as monopoly
(or nearly a monopoly) in the management of both. The only source for blood (in a legal sense) is through
the government blood banks. Provincial Bureaus of Health set the prices paid by the blood banks to blood
donors (equal to RMB 100, September 1998) and the prices paid by those receiving blood from the blood
banks (equal to RMB 183-200, September 1998).
4.15   Finally, to calculate the IRR for this subcomponent, it was necessary to assess the demand for
blood in these project provinces. This assessment is based on limited information regarding trends in the
rising demand for blood. The assumptions included in this assessment were: (a) demand will rise as
population increases; (b) demand will not be affected by price increases, as the decision for using blood is
primarily take by the physician or other health care provider on behalf of the patient; and (c) income
increases will influence the demand for blood. An estimate for the income elasticity for blood was
estimated from limited information included in the four provinces PIPs and it was about 1.01. Two other
alternative estimates were included in the assessment including 1.1 and 1.2. Alternative income increases
were also assessed, including 3.5 percent per year, 5 percent per year, which is the most likely scenario,
and 6.5 percent per year.
4.16   Based on these charges remaining stable, trends in the demand for blood, and the expected capital
and recurrent costs to be incurred via the project over the next ten years, the IRR will greatly exceed 5,000
percent.

Annex 4
4.17   Blood Transfusion Services Subcomponent CEA. This subcomponent not only provides benefits in
the form of reduced prevalence and incidence of diseases transmitted via the blood supply, it also improves
the quality of inpatient health services, including during child birth, especially during surgery. It is difficult
to quantify these two sets of benefits in a consistent manner. However, this assessment has evaluated one
scenario based on a reduction in the incidence of three important blood transmitted health problems: (a)
HIV; (b) other STDs such as syphilis; and (c) Hepatitis B and C.
4.18   The scenario includes a number of assumptions so that a quantitative calculation might be made.
The cost estimates for this subcomponent in the provincial proposals were used, along with assumptions
regarding: (a) timing of expenditures over the ten year period of evaluation; and (b) the size of the
recurrent expenditures required to sustain this service prograrn after the five year life of the project. One of
the project provinces included a table indicating a prospective expenditure time line and it was assumed
that other provinces would configure their expenditures similarly. Thus, about 40 percent of the
expenditures are assumed to occur in each of the first two years of the project, with the third year about 18
percent, and the balance going for the recurrent expenditures subsequently. It is assumed that the recurrent
expenditures will continue past the five year life of the project at the same rate of expenditure as during the
last two years of this subcomponent.
4.19   The estimation of DALYs saved from safer blood also required several assumptions. First,
Hepatitis B and C are major health problems in China today with about 0.35 percent of the annual disease
burden attributed to it. By investing in improved blood supply procedures and equipment, it is thought that
at least 80 percent of the hepatitis burden in these provinces could be prevented each year after the program
was fully implemented. Thus, a share of the estimated annual DALYs lost from hepatitis begins at a 20
percent savings in the first year and rises by ten percent each year until reaching 80 percent in year six.
Second, experts believe at least ten percent of the STD burden of disease could be prevented by reducing
the spread of syphilis. Third, it is thought that about ten percent of the new cases of HIV is due to blood
contamination.
4.20   On the basis of these enumerated assumptions, a cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated related to
the preventive benefits accruing from improving the blood supply. The estimate shows that it costs about
RMB 181 (US$21.85) per DALY saved. While this figure is more costly than for other project
components assessed, it remains a "good buy", especially if the impact on quality of care for hospital based
care is also included. The analysis also shows that after the initial cost of investment, the recurrent cost-
effectiveness ratio drops to about RMB 20 (US$2.40), a "very good buy".
5.     Poverty Assessment
5.1    The three major project sub/components vary in the extent to which they directly address poverty
alleviation. The component addressing MCH is primarily focussed on mitigating adverse social impacts of
poverty, along with improving health status of women and children. This component will be implemented
in 113 poverty designated counties in five provinces: Guizhou, Hainan, Hunan, Jilin, and Xinjiang.
5.2    First, it will extend the benefits which have been realized via the Health VI Project implemented in
282 poverty designated counties of eight provinces covering nearly one hundred million persons, and an
additional 51 million persons residing in poverty designated counties. The "poverty" counties in these
provinces have an average per capita income equaling about 83 percent of the average per capita income in
these provinces, with the range being 87 percent in Guizhou to 63 percent in Xinjiang. These poverty

China                                                                        Health Nine Project
Annex 4
counties have a per capita income less than 25 percent of the average national per capita income. Further,
the share of total provincial income in these counties is about 26 percent (range 14 percent in Xinjiang to
30 percent in Hunan), whereas the total population residing in them is about 33 percent.
5.3    Second, IMR and MMR are 50 percent and 30 percent greater, respectively, in the poverty
designated counties than the corresponding provincial averages, and are about 75 percent and 250 percent
greater, respectively, than national norms. Thus, by directly improving the MCH services in poverty
designated counties, human welfare can be directly enhanced. The experience gained during the
implementation of the first three years of the Health VI Project suggests that these health status differentials
between poverty and non-poverty counties can be realized within the five year life of the proposed project.3/
5.4    The HIV/AIDS/STDs Component also has a poverty focus but not as distinct as the MHCD
Component. It seeks to slow the rapid increase in the incidence and prevalence of all STDs as well as
HIV/AIDS. As the epidemic matures in China, the locus of disease will increasingly reside within
disenfranchised population(s). These populations include those who are migrating from rural to urban
areas to seek better economic opportunities in urban areas, or those who have been laid off from state
owned enterprises or other employers and have used the informal employment market for sexual services to
continue to earn a living. As this component works out the details for implementing successful preventive
programs in a number of high risk groups in specific cities and towns, its focus can increasingly become
poverty alleviating.
5.5    Finally, the blood transfusion services subcomponent can also alleviate poverty as it enhances the
quality of blood and blood products used in health service provision. This is due to the fact that a greater
share of the poor cannot obtain high quality blood products in times of need because of costs. To the extent
improvements in the nation's blood supply are realized, poverty alleviation can occur as a positive
externality.

Fiscal Analysis
This analysis examines: the fiscal burden of the project during implementation and the
sustainability of the project after completion; and the assessment of financial management.
1.    Affordability and Sustainability
1.1    Affordability. The recently completed World Bank study of health financing in China shows that
national expenditures on health comprise a growing share of GDP, from about three percent in 1978 to
probably over four percent in 1998. If so, per capita expenditure for health in 1998 is estimated at RMB
265 per person, up from RMB 111 per person in 1993.1/ In 1993, the public sector share of that spending
was about 14 percent, falling from 32 percent recorded in 1986 and 28 percent in 1978. The recurrent
share of public funding in 1993 was about 57 percent of the total public spending for health in that year, or
about RMB 8.8 per person.2/ The current public level of spending on health is RMB 37.7 per capita. In
the poverty provinces included in the HIV/AIDS/STDs Component, public funds for recurrent health
services average RMB 11 per person per year as of 1996, which is considered low.
1.2    Nearly all Bank supported health sector projects in China have claimed that because the recurrent
expenditures of the implemented health investments were such a small share of national health expenditures
(generally less than one percent of total public recurrent expenditures), and economic growth was high,
fiscal sustainability would occur if political will at the appropriate government level allocated sufficient
recurrent budgetary resources for the proposed public health intervention. However, in 1997, the World
Bank report on health sector financing demonstrated that, in spite of this theoretical possibility of fund
adequacy, provincial and county budget allocations have often been too low to sustain preventive health
service provision. As a result, the national government has become more concerned with this issue and has
renewed its policy priorities for public health services and has initiated measures for ensuring adequate
funding support. In January 1997, the State Council of the People's Republic of China released its
Decision Paper on Health Reform and Development, which included a directive to all levels in China to
increase the government budgetary allocation for health in line with overall economic development.
1.3    Since part of this project (MHCD Component) is being implemented in poor rural counties where
the per capita income is only one-third to one-half the national average, it is more important than in
previous projects to assess whether this project's specific investments can be financially sustainable by the
government entities responsible for financial sustainability. This is even more important since one of the
critical elements of the MHCD anti-poverty component is to initiate local administered poverty relief funds
to enable the very poor (the lowest five percent of the population) to obtain ante-natal, delivery, and post-
natal services. The Health VI Mid-term Evaluation suggests that this aspect of the earlier project has
encountered financial and administrative difficulties, and that fiurther intensive study is required to improve

the financial and service provision obtained via poverty relief funds.'/ The role of the poverty relief fund in
relationship to other broader based rural health insurance mechanisms under development warrants special
study at this time to ensure complementary design and role development.
1.4   From the BCA analysis conducted and summarized above, it has been estimated that the recurrent
cost of sustaining the project's MCH investments in the five provinces will be about RMB 0.45 per capita
per year. Based on this finding, and total public financing of health care information, the MHCD
Component comprises about 5.1 percent of present total public expenditures on health. This share is
greater than the guidelines for all preventive programs, which are expected to cost about three percent of
total public expenditures for health. Thus, without considering the additional project components, it is
likely that financial sustainability may be in some jeopardy unless the current financing guidelines can be
modified.
2.    Assessment of Financial Management
2.1   In accordance with the Bank's O.P./B.P. 10.02, the team reviewed the financial management
arrangements of current Bank supported health projects in the participating provinces, as similar
arrangements will be adopted under this project. It was found that: (a) The project accounting system is
independent from the government budget system although some counterpart funds come from government
budget. The document on accounting and financial reporting for Bank financed projects in China, issued in
1993 and revised in 1996 by MOF, has been used by the projects. Based on the MOF document, the
specific written accounting policy and procedure manuals for each project have been prepared by FLO and
distributed to relevant project staff at each level. In general, the accounting systems are working well
although most are manual and not computerized; (b) Internal control and segregation of responsibility. The
project budget is prepared by the project units, and executed after review and approval by the Project
Management Offices (PMOs) and FBs. MOF and FLO are responsible for final approval and monitoring
of budget implementation. The project accounting books are kept in the project offices and units. MOF
and FBs are responsible for Bank disbursements. The project cash disbursement and expenditure approval
procedures follow MOF's regulations. Claims are expedited by the project office at each level, with review
by FB at each level before submission to the level above. Funds are transferred from level to level through
commercial banks nominated by FB at each level. The original supporting documents are kept in the
project offices and units, and usually one copy is kept in provincial FLOs; (c) Staffing. The PMOs have
designated financial units whose staff has clearly defined and separate functions. Most financial staffs at
provincial and above levels have financial education background and working experience on Bank financed
projects, but most provincial financial staffs at county or below levels do not have sufficient skills; (d)
Financial statements are regulated by the MOF document, and include Balance Sheet, Statement of Project
Progress, Statement of the Bank Funds Use, Statement of Expenses Profile, and Statement of Special
Account; and (e) Audit. The project accounts and accounting reports will be audited by the State Audit
Administration or its local offices in accordance with standard practices in China, which have been found
acceptable to the Bank.
2.2    The main issues identified during the financial assessment were: (a) delays in processing and flow
of funds due to complexity and lack of understanding of procedures, regulations, and intemal disbursement
procedures, which involve PMOs and FBs at each level; (b) financial statements are not very usefiul to

MOH for project management or to the Bank for project monitoring; and (c) financial staffs at county or
below levels lack training, reference manuals, and project documents.
2.3   In response to the financial assessment, the Borrower agreed to improve the project's financial
management arrangements, through the following actions: (a) FLO will prepare a detailed manual on
accounting and internal disbursement procedures, and make it readily available to the PMO financial units.
Training and retraining on financial management will be included in the technical assistance plan; (b)
additional reporting formats will be introduced according to the Bank's "Guide for Review and Design of
Accounting and Reporting Systems for World Bank Financed Projects." The reports should be useful to
the Bank and MOH, and practical for use under the accounting system. The reporting formats will be
available before project start-up; and (c) although the internal disbursement procedures regulated by MOF
will not be changed, some methods such as increasing provincial level revolving funds will be adopted to
shorten the timing of process and flow of funds. The Bank's resident mission in Beijing (RMC) will
provide support in implementation of these actions, through training and technical assistance, and in review
and supervision of financial management of the project.

Selection of Consultants, dated July 1997.
2.    The project's national level implementing unit, the Foreign Loan Office of MOH, has managed
procurement for eight earlier Bank supported health projects, and most of the project provinces and many
of the counties also have experience of previous projects.
Summary of Procurement Arrangements (Table A)
3.    Civil Works (US$8.04 million including contingencies). The project will finance new
construction and rehabilitation of MCH care and HIV/AIDS/STDs institutions and training facilities. The
value of work on any individual health institution and facility will usually be less than US$50,000. As
many of the institutions and facilities are in remote locations and as construction will be spread over time
due to factors such as planning procedures and climate, the work is unlikely to be of interest to foreign
bidders.
4.    Works contracts costing US$300,000 or less (not anticipated to exceed US$1.61 million in the
aggregate), will be procured through NCB. Smaller works contracts, each costing less than US$100,000,
not to exceed US$4.42 million in the aggregate, will be awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from
three qualified bidders, with the contract awarded to the lowest evaluated bidder. Township construction
teams will be encouraged to bid. Minor repairs and works contracts estimated to cost less than US$25,000
in scattered and remote areas, may be procured by force account in a manner satisfactory to the Bank, not
to exceed US$1.21 million in the aggregate.
6.    G6ods (US$38.22 million including contingencies). Goods including equipment, vehicles, medical
supplies, and materials will be procured for the project. Previous experience with implementation of health
projects in poor rural areas indicates there will be limited use of ICB for procurement of goods. The
selection of an item for procurement through ICB may be based on technical specifications (for some
medical and communication equipment and vehicles), as well as the estimated aggregate size of the
package. Goods contracts of US$300,000 or above, and contracts for vehicles regardless of contract cost,
will be procured through ICB. Agreement has been reached on a list of selected equipment items that will
be procured using ICB, which is subject to review during project implementation. Qualified domestic
manufacturers will be eligible for a margin of preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent or the prevailing
rate of custom duty, whichever is less. Contract packages costing less than US$300,000, not to exceed
US$15.29 million in the aggregate, if not procured by ICB, will be procured through NCB acceptable to

China                                                                        Health Nine Project

the Bank. International suppliers may compete in these procedures. Contracts with an estimated value of
less than US$30,000 each, not to exceed US$4.97 million in the aggregate, will be awarded through
national shopping procedures after solicitation and evaluation of at least three written price quotations.
Goods which should be procured as an extension of an existing contract, or which must be purchased from
the original supplier, are of a proprietary nature, or from a particular supplier as a condition of a
performance guarantee, not to exceed US$0.76 million in the aggregate, subject to the approval of the Bank
on a case-by-case basis, may be awarded on a direct contract basis, in accordance with procedures
acceptable to the Bank.
7.     Equipment lists for the project have been prepared by the Borrower and reviewed by the Bank, and
are detailed in the PIPs. The equipment lists will be reviewed during the Mid-term Evaluation, with a view
to introducing newly available appropriate technology.
8.    In-country and Overseas Training (US$16.57 million including contingencies). This category
includes training expenses such as courses, workshops, and travel and subsistence allowances. Overseas
study tours and placement of candidates in foreign institutions would be made on the basis of relevance and
quality, cost and prior experience, following government procedures. Local training will be carried out in
selected institutions on the basis of training programns described in the PIPs. Each county's annual training
progress and the next year's plan will be reviewed by relevant provincial experts, and reported to the
project's expert group.
9.     Technical Assistance (US$3.45 million including contingencies). Technical assistance (TA),
provided by individuals and institutions, both local and international, will be selected and contracted in
accordance with the Consultant Guidelines. Most TA will be for contracts of less than US$ 100,000, using
Selection Based on Consultants' Qualifications, or the procedures for employing service delivery
contractors and individuals. The Bank will review progress reports and annual plans for TA for provincial
and central levels.
10.   Health Services (US$2.78 million including contingencies). Through the mechanism of poverty
relief funds the project will fully or partially reimburse service providers for approved health services to
designated and eligible very poor families in the project areas. The county health bureau will manage the
fund, according to management and reporting requirements acceptable to the Bank. Some costs of high
priority medical services such as maternal care and immunization, used by other designated groups, may
also be reimbursed to approved service providers, according to guidelines acceptable to the Bank.
11.   Program Support (US$20.75 million including contingencies) will include: surveillance and
monitoring activities, logistical support, information collection and reporting, workshops (excluding
training materials), medical supplies (excluding drug reagents), non-medical supplies and materials,
transportation, accommodations, consumable materials, and allowances for health staff, but excluding staff
salaries. Program support is critical to reverse the recent decline in availability of funds for the
management and maintenance of preventive health care programs. In addition, by demonstrating the
benefits of adequate program support, the project would increase internal support for such expenditures in
the Government. For these reasons, financing of program support will be on a fixed rather than declining
basis.

Annex 6
Thresholds for Procurement Methods and Prior Review (Table B)
13.   Prior review by the Bank of all stages of the bidding process will be required for: (a) the first two
proposed works contracts from each province, regardless of the cost; (b) the first two proposed NCB goods
contracts from each province; and (c) all goods and works contracts procured using ICB. In view of the
social objective of the project and using parameters developed in previous health projects, prior review
coverage will be of approximately 15 percent of works contracts and 65 percent of goods contracts.
14.    The Terms of Reference (TORs) for all overseas study tours, including the criteria for selection of
participants, will be subject to prior review by the Bank. TA contracts with firms of US$100,000
equivalent or more and contracts with individuals of US$50,000 equivalent or more will require the Bank's
prior review and approval of budgets, short-lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals,
evaluation reports, and contracts.
Post Review
15.   It is expected that post review of documents related to 25 percent of contracts and direct purchases
will be conducted according to Bank guidelines. This arrangement will be assessed during the Mid-term
Evaluation, and if indicated the percentage may be reviewed.
Disbursement
16.    The proposed loan of US$10.0 million and credit of US$50.0 million equivalent would be
disbursed over a period of six years, up to the closing date of June 30, 2006. The allocation of loan and
credit proceeds according to expenditure category is outlined in Table C.
17.    Disbursements will be made against statements of expenditure (SOEs) for: (a) works under
contracts costing less than US$300,000 each; (b) goods under contracts costing less than US$300,000
each; (c) contracts for the employment of consulting firms valued at less than US$100,000 each, and
contracts for the employment of individuals valued at less than US$50,000 each; and (d) training and
program support. These limits are based on previous experience, and the nature and complexity of the
project. Documentation supporting the SOEs would be retained by FLO in MOH and the Project
Management Offices in the provinces and made available for review by Bank supervision missions. All
other disbursements from the loan and credit would be against full documentation.
18.    Special Accounts. To facilitate disbursement there will be five Special Accounts for the project:
one for Component A and Component C; and one for each province under Component B. The Special
Accounts would be established in US dollars, in commercial banks acceptable to the Bank and on terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The Special Accounts would be used for all eligible foreign and
local expenditures. Applications for replenishment of the Special Accounts would be submitted monthly or
whenever the Account has been drawn down by about 50 percent of the initial deposit, whichever occurs
first. The aggregate initial deposit for the five Special Accounts is US$2.88 million equivalent.
19.    To ensure timely start-up of the project, retroactive financing of up to SDR 2.2 million (US$3.0
million equivalent) would be available for payments made for eligible expenditures incurred after January
1, 1999.

Annex 6
Project Accounts and Financial Reporting
20.    Separate project accounts showing expenditure for project activities will be maintained by the BOF
at each level, and for central level expenditures by MOH. With assistance of MOF, a total project account
will be maintained by the central level PMO in two books, one for project provinces and the other for the
expenditure categories for the whole project. Each county and prefecture project office will submit regular
financial management reports to the provincial project office. Provinces will submit their financial
management reports regularly to the PMO in MOH for review and summary. The financial statements will
include the following:
*  Statement of Sources and Uses of Fund (including information on expenditure by disbursement
category).
*  Statement of Costs by Component, showing actual against the budgeted costs with variances.
*  Statement of Unit Variance, comparing the actual and planned physical output with the actual
and planned cost for each unit of output.
*  Special Account Reconciliation Statement, which will be the basis for replenishment.
21.    Project accounts would be audited by the State Audit Administration or its local offices in
accordance with standard practices in China, which have been found acceptable to the Bank.
22.    The Borrower will submit three types of financial reports to the Bank's disbursement office, in
format and at a frequency acceptable to the Bank.
A.    Financial Statements as described above.
B.    Project Progress Report.
C.    Procurement Report for prior review contracts for goods, works and consultant services.
