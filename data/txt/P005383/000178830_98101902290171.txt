LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:          Kingdom of Morocco
Loan Amount:        $1.5 million
Terms:              10 years including 3 years grace with interest at
8.00 percent per year.
Project
Description:      The Project's objective is to assist Morocco in developing
the design and planning criteria for upgrading urban sewer
systems, as well as in strengthening and reorganizing the
institutions in the sewerage sector, in the process of
preparing a feasibility study (sewerage master plan) of the
sewer system for Casablanca-Mohammedia area. The Project
includes preparation of a priority project constituting the
first stage of the sewerage master plan and the acquisition
of oceanography equipment required to carry out the studies.
The direct benefit of this Engineering Project is that it
will result in a viable sewerage proposal for the Casablanca-
Mohammedia region, which will reduce public health hazards
and risks to fisheries deriving from pollution of coastal
waters. The Project faces no special risks. A detailed
work plan for the consultants will be prepared in accordance
with the agreed technical terms of reference and the Govern-
ment has agreed to give special attention to the technical
capacity of the consultant staff so as to minimize the risk
of the studies not meeting the project objectives.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A SEWERAGE ENGINEERING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Kingdom of Morocco, for the equivalent of US$1.5 million to help
finance a Sewerage Engineering Project. The loan would have a term of 10
years including 3 years of grace with interest at 8.0 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Morocco" (1473-MOR, dated June 30, 1977) is being distributed concurrently
to the Executive Directors.
3.        During the 1968-72 Plan, Morocco succeeded in accelerating the
growth of its economy and in improving the situation of its external payments.
Aided substantially by good crops following favorable weather in three years
out of five, real GDP growth averaged 5.6 percent per annum during the five-
year period. Reflecting the sustained rise in exports during the Plan period
and a slower growth of imports in 1971 and 1972, the balance of payments showed
a surplus from 1969 onward. These results represented a definite improvement
over those of the preceding decade, during which the rate of real GDP growth
had barely exceeded that of population growth, and the balance of payments
had been a source of constant concern. These achievements were accompanied
by an increase in private consumption averaging about 2 percent per capita
in real terms during the five-year period.
4.        From 1967 to 1970, the main growth determinants had been exports,
tourism and investment, all of which rose substantially; in addition sizeable
stocks were accumulated following the exceptionally good harvest in 1968.
By contrast, in 1971-72, exports and tourism together with current govern-
ment spending were the major factors to sustain economic growth. During
these last two years of the Plan, the investment of public and semi-public
enterprises declined, largely because the state-owned phosphate company
(OCP) had completed its expansion program. Government investment stagnated
after 1968. Private investors adopted a wait-and-see attitude in the face
of political developments in 1971 and 1972 and in the expectation of new
measures to encourage investment and exports. At the end of the 1968-72
Plan period, there was therefore an urgent need to revive public and private
investment. Particularly in the public sector, absorptive capacity needed to
be increased by appropriate changes in staffing and organization.
1/   This part is substantially the same as paragraphs 2-17 of the President's
Report No. P-2023-MOR on a Loan to the Banque Nationale pour le Developp-
ment Economique, dated May 6, 1977.



- 2 -
5.        Following a long period of very slow growth in private consumption,
social problems had to be tackled. Over the 1969-71 period, there had been
a slow but perceptible decline in real per capita consumption for about one-
third of the rural population. Wealth and income differences between cities
and villages, among regions, and between rich and poor tended to widen.      Un-
employment remained high; it averaged in 1971, 9 percent of the country's labor
force, and ranged between 12 and 16 percent in large urban centers.
6.        Recognizing these difficulties and problems, the Government began in
1971 to revise its development policies, paying increasing attention to social
objectives. The changed orientations were reflected in the 1973-77 Plan which
aimed at: (1) GDP growth of 7.5 percent per annum in real terms from 1973 to
1977, mainly through a sharp increase in public and private investment and a
strategy geared strongly toward increasing exports; and (2) an improvement in
the distribution of growth benefits among the different social groups and the
various regions, to achieve greater equity and at the same time increase
domestic demand. This improvement was to be brought about through a modest
program of distributing colon lands to poor farmers, more emphasis on the
development of rainfed agriculture, "Moroccanization" of some industrial and
commercial enterprises, a price and wage policy designed to enable the poorest
segments of the population to satisfy their essential needs, an ambitious
program of low-cost housing, various measures to improve the lot of the rural
poor, and increased emphasis on the development of the poorest regions.
7.        In 1974 and 1975, Morocco benefitted from a large increase in the
average export price of phosphate, its main export product, which provided
substantial additional resources compared to the Plan's expectation. The Gov-
ernment decided in 1975 to step up investment spending for the years 1975-77,
and the allocations for investment by the public and semi-public sectors were
increased substantially in the annual Budget Laws. Part of the additional
allocations were to cover investment cost increases, and a larger part to
launch expanded or new investment programs.
Recent Economic Performance
8.        During the first three years of the 1973-77 Plan period, Morocco's
overall economic performance improved substantially as compared to the past.
Gross fixed investment rose sharply and reached 24 percent of GDP in 1975 and
almost 30 percent in 1976. Investments in the public and semi-public sectors
contributed strongly to this increase and there was also a good response on
the part of private investors to the new incentives introduced in 1973. Indus-
trial growth accelerated to an average annual rate of about 11.5 percent for
the first three years of the Plan compared to 6 percent in 1968-72, in large
part because of the vigorous expansion of construction in response to rising
investment demand. At the same time, increased emphasis was put on achieving
the social objectives of the 1973-77 Plan with the implementation of an ac-
celerated low-cost housing program, expanded investments in social sectors
in small cities, and a program of small-scale investments in disfavored re-
gions. In the face of import price rises, especially for wheat, sugar and
edible oil, the Government also raised significantly price subsidies for these



- 3 -
essential foodstuffs and adjusted upward legal minimum wages in agriculture
and industry with a view to protecting the purchasing power of low-income
groups.
9.        Some weaknesses appeared, however, during this period.   After the
five-fold increase in phosphate exports receipts between 1973 and 1974,
expected further increases in financial resources did not materialize in 1975.
Due to weakening external demand, phosphate exports decreased to 13.1 million
tons, from 18.7 million tons in 1974, and phosphate prices began to drop
sharply in the second half of 1975, restraining the country's real capacity
to save and to import. Unfavorable weather resulted in poor crops in 1973 and
in 1975 and to meet domestic demand, food imports were increased substantially.
In constant prices, value added by the mining and agricultural sectors returned
in 1975 to levels slightly below those of 1972. Despite the fast growth of
industry (excl. mining) and services, real GDP growth averaged only about 4 per-
cent per year in 1973-75. As a result largely of the disappointing performance
of phosphate exports in 1975, Morocco's internal and external finances came
under pressure. The Treasury's accounts showed in 1975 an overall deficit
twice the 1974 level, due mainly to sharply rising capital spending and insuf-
ficient growth in budgetary savings. This contributed to inflationary pressure
domestically; the cost of living index rose by nearly 8 percent in 1975. The
current account of the balance of payments, which had shown a surplus of $105
million in 1973 and $237 million in 1974, registered a deficit of $546 million
in 1975.
10.       In 1976, GDP growth accelerated to 10 percent, thanks mainly to a
good cereal harvest (48 percent larger than the previous years) and the conti-
nued growth momentum in manufacturing, construction and services. The expan-
sionary investment policies of 1973-75 continued, and the 1976 Budget Law
raised further the allocations for investments in the public and semi-public
sectors. Several measures were, however, taken to curb the growth of consump-
tion demand, including some restraint in current budgetary spending, the suc-
cessful placement last summer of a DH 1 billion ($230 million) bond issue
among the Moroccan public, and the introduction of credit restraints. Never-
theless, for the full year, imports registered another sizeable increase, not
matched by recovery of export receipts, and the balance of payments current
account reached an estimated $1.4 billion deficit, against $0.5 billion in
1975. There was a small decrease ($15 million) in the country's net foreign
assets, as the current deficit was nearly covered by substantially increased
net external capital inflows. Morocco considerably stepped up borrowings from
Arab and commercial sources (see Annex 1, page 4), it drew on IMF facilities
for a total amount of SDR 115 million in early 1976, and it obtained large
grantlike inflows. Since early 1976, when Spain relinquished its control over
the Spanish Sahara, Morocco and Mauritania have extended their administration
to this territory, the northern part being administered by Morocco. Available
information is not detailed enough to trace the impact of spending for former
Spanish Sahara on government expenditures, imports and external capital in-
flows, but it shows that the substantial increments in government spending
and imports for the Sahara were nearly offset by grant inflows from external
sources.



- 4 -
11.       For 1977, the trends in consumption demand, particularly for imported
consumer goods, have to be curbed further, and investment growth in the public
and semi-public sectors has to be significantly slowed, in order to keep devel-
opments in the internal and external financial situation under firm control.
The Government has been introducing measures to restrain domestic demand.
While 1977 would, with such measures, be a year of retrenchment by comparison
with policies during the first four years of the 1973-77 Plan, tentative Bank
estimates (Annex 1, page 3) indicate that overall performance of the economy
should be satisfactory for the Plan period as a whole. They show that a rapid
growth of investment (between 16 and 17 percent a year) would have been
achieved, exceeding the original Plan targets for 1973-77. They also show
relatively good gains in GDP (about 6 percent a year) and consumption (close
to 3 percent a year per capita), despite the rather disappointing developments
in real terms for the phosphate and agricultural sectors. Finally, national
savings would have financed a larger share of 1973-77 investments than anti-
cipated originally. A detailed review of the economy's performance during
1973-77 will be undertaken by the Bank next fiscal year, in conjunction with
an assessment of Morocco's next five-year Plan (1978-82).
Development Prospects
12.       The Plan revisions that were introduced since 1975 have maintained
or strengthened the investment programs designed to achieve the original
economic and social objectives of the 1973-77 Plan. They have, in addition,
greatly increased allocations for regional development, for low-cost housing,
and especially for three industrial investment programs to be implemented over
the next decade. These programs are a one-million ton steel mill and related
infrastructure at Nador, a series of sugar mills and related irrigation devel-
opment and several chemical units based partly on phosphate. Thus, the
Plan revisions will have an important spill-over effect on the next 1978-82
Plan.
13.       The general thrust of the Plan revisions seems justified.   Indeed,
the achievement of initial (especially social) Plan objectives is eminently
desirable. Similarly, Morocco's economy has developed to a stage where some
basic industries may find a justified place. The country in particular
possesses an obvious comparative advantage in the processing of phosphates,
which would tend to stabilize export earnings. Similarly, it can produce at
competitive cost steel and sugar which it would otherwise import, although cost
competitiveness in both cases is difficult to assess because of volatility in
international prices. The Plan revisions nonetheless raise several issues of
importance for Morocco's long-term development strategy and prospects.
14.       The present investment level is close to the country's absorptive
capacity. Although training efforts have been stepped up, it is likely that
shortages of skilled and experienced manpower will continue to be a problem
for some years to come. While for large industrial and infrastructure proj-
ects, Morocco can use foreign services extensively, this is costly and would
not be a suitable solution to meeting the needs of smaller investments in
large numbers. Further, investments in steel and chemical industries will
generate comparatively little direct employment opportunities for unskilled
workers.



15.       In addition, financial constraints may in future again restrain
Morocco's overall development efforts.   While there is scope for increasing
phosphate exports, the prospects in the medium term are that the price of
phosphate will remain stable. Hence, Morocco's real capacity to save and
import would be expected to increase only moderately. The pursuit of the
objectives and policies to improve consumption levels of low income groups
would also restrain national savings. Thus, in spite of likely efforts to
increase budgetary savings and import substitution (particularly food), for-
eign exchange and national savings are likely to be constraints on investment
during the next Plan period.
16.       Bank projections which are preliminary, since the Government has not
yet fixed the 1978-82 Plan's objectives and strategy, indicate that gross
fixed investment could only grow slowly in view of limited resources available.
Given the planned move into heavy industries, investment possibilities in other
sectors would by necessity be limited. Assuming a real investment growth of
about 3 percent per year and export growth of about 8 percent, which seems
feasibile in view of market prospects and export capacity, GDP growth could
probably average about 6 percent yearly during the 1978-82 period. Despite
implementation of policies to restrain consumer goods imports and likely import
substitution, Morocco is likely to experience a sizeable resource gap, and need
relatively large inflows of external capital to cover it and to service accumu-
lated debt. External borrowing requirements on a commitment basis, are tenta-
tively projected to average $900 million per year in 1978-82, about two-thirds
of which are expected to be met by official multilateral and bilateral sources
and the rest by commercial sources. Morocco has successfully increased ex-
ternal borrowings in 1974-76; loan commitments have risen to $550 million in
1974, $860 million in 1975 and an estimated $802 million in 1976. Morocco
should, therefore, be able to mobilize the amounts projected for 1978-82.
17.       External debt and debt service would increase as a result of pro-
jected borrowings. Debt outstanding and disbursed, which was $1.6 billion at
the end of 1975 (20 percent of GDP) is projected to rise to a $4.5 billion (or
25 percent of GDP) by the end of 1982. Similarly, debt service payments is
likely to rise from the low 6.9 percent of exports in 1975 to about 21 percent
in 1982. Adding workers' remittances to exports, the debt service ratio,
which was less than 6 percent in 1975, might rise to 19 percent in 1982.
These projected levels for debt and debt service are high, but still within
Morocco's debt carrying capacity, especially when considering the country's
improved economic and social policies and its long-term export prospects, not
only in phosphate rock and related products, but also in agricultural and
industrial commodities for the European market. Beyond 1982, the relative
burden of debt would probably tend to decline gradually as Morocco benefits
from anticipated supplier's market for phosphates and its resource gap conse-
quently tends to diminish. Morocco is therefore considered creditworthy for
further Bank lending.



-6-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MOROCCO
18.       Bank and IDA lending to Morocco has supported 32 projects, finan-
cing a total of $834.4 million (net of cancellations); of this total $620.5
million has been lent since the beginning of FY73. IDA credits, totalling
$50.0 million, have been made available for five projects. A Third Window
loan for $25 million for the third education project was approved in March
1976. IFC investments have amounted to $11.3 million. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of June 30,
1977, and notes on the execution of ongoing IBRD/IDA projects. In some cases,
delays in project implementation have been caused by management or procurement
difficulties, and in 1974 cost overruns increased due to the upsurge in invest-
ment activity in Morocco and the acceleration of inflation. However, overall
performance has improved during the last two years.
19.       Past Bank Group lending has been concentrated in the agricultural
and industrial sectors, which respectively have accounted for 32 and 35 per-
cent of total net commitments; the balance is accounted for by utilities (18
percent), tourism (8 percent), roads (5 percent) and education (4 percent).
Apart from the transfer of resources to Morocco (Bank Group gross disburse-
ments amounted to 5.5 percent of total fixed investment in 1970-74), the main
objectives of lending were to foster and strengthen development institutions,
provide technical assistance especially for project preparation, and increase
productive capacity, particularly in order to improve the balance of payments.
20.       While these objectives remain, emphasis is also being given to sup-
port the Government's social development and income distribution objectives.
An increasing share of Bank Group lending will be devoted to projects directly
or indirectly developing the productive capacity of the lowest urban and rural
income groups.
21.       Past lending for agriculture has supported irrigation development,
credit and, through a first operation in FY75, the improvement of the produc-
tivity of rainfed farming. While continued lending for irrigation is envis-
aged, greater emphasis will be given to supporting the improvement of rainfed
farming, and lending will in general be focused on support to small farmers.
Projects for livestock/rural development in the rainfed zones in northern
Morocco, for developing production of fruits and vegetables on small holdings
and for promoting integrated rural development in selected regions of Morocco
are being prepared.
22.       Projects in industry and tourism have as key objectives increased
foreign exchange earnings or savings and the improvement of sectoral policies.
A project for the construction of a large cement plant in the less developed
Northeast and an eighth loan to BNDE including a small scale industry component
were recently approved. Proposals for industrial lending, including the con-
struction of a steel mill in northeast Morocco, are under consideration. Con-
tinued lending for industry and tourism through two DFC's (Banque Nationale
pour le Developpement Economique-BNDE and Credit Immobilier et Hotelier-CIH)
will be proposed.



- 7 -
23.       Previous lending for utilities has consisted of one loan for water
supply and two loans for power. A follow up project for water supply and
distribution in urban centers is under preparation, as is a sewerage project
in Agadir.
24.       A first urban development project is being appraised.   It aims at
contributing a model for coping with the problem of rapid growth of slum areas
and would include a substantial social services component and an employment
generation program.
25.       Education is a critical bottleneck in Morocco's development.   Two
credits and a loan have been made to develop secondary education and teacher
training, to improve technical and vocational training, and to improve facili-
ties in rural areas. A fourth project with emphasis on technical education is
under preparation.
26.       Loan commitments from multilateral and bilateral official sources to
Morocco rose from $92 million in 1973 to $425 million in 1974 and $538 million
in 1975. In addition Morocco received grants totalling $40 million in 1973
and $42 million in 1974. The major sources of aid were France, Saudi Arabia,
the UAE, the U.S., Germany and the Bank Group. At the end of 1976, the Bank
Group's share in Morocco's outstanding and disbursed external public debt was
estimated at 13 percent. The share of the Bank Group in debt service was 20
percent in 1975 and an estimated 13 percent in 1976. By 1982 the Bank Group's
shares in debt outstanding and in debt service are expected to be about 17
percent and 11 percent respectively, on the basis of the assumptions made for
total external borrowings for the 1976-82 period (paragraph 17).
PART III - THE SEWERAGE SECTOR
Introduction
27.       The development of the sewerage sector in Morocco has failed to keep
pace with the requirements arising from an urban population growth of over 5
percent p.a. and rapid industrialization. Existing infrastructure is essen-
tially limited to collection systems for major urban centers. In rural areas,
sewerage development has been limited to primitive excreta collection systems.
Institutions are typically weak, lack technical expertise and an autonomous
financial base for their operations. Until recently, there was no institution
responsible for formulating a sewerage policy at the national level to address
issues such as the establishment of appropriate effluent standards and pollu-
tion control policies. It is still too early to judge whether a sewerage unit
recently created within the Ministry of the Interior will be able to perform
these functions (see para. 29).
Urban Sewerage Practices
28.       Urban sewer systems have been constructed along traditional European
patterns and usually combine evacuation of waste and storm waters in a single



- 8 -
network. This procedure has proved to be unsatisfactory in Morocco because of
climatic conditions and is aggravated in cities built on flat lands where it
produces deposition of organic matter inside the sewers causing nauseous odors
and internal sewer corrosion. Recognition of this problem has recently led to
the decision to construct separate waste and storm water systems in new urban
developments. Such a separation allows for a design of the wastewater evacua-
tion system using smaller diameter pipes, steeper slopes and pumping stations
to maintain a sufficient flow of wastewaters to keep the system flushed and
prevent deposition of organic matter. Under the present circumstances, the
combination of increasing wastewater flows, inadequate disposal procedures and
the lack of treatment facilities constitute a growing health hazard. In
coastal areas, sewers typically discharge at the shoreline without the benefit
of coastal interceptors or submarine outfalls. These multiple discharges into
the well aerated waters of the surf zone provide adequate dispersion and aera-
tion of organic wastes, but have caused severe bacteriological contamination
of coastal waters around major cities which has already slowed tourism devel-
opment and threatens shellfish beds and fish spawning areas. The absence of
water quality standards and of controls on industrial liquid wastes is a grow-
ing threat to marine life and to public health. A concerted effort to evaluate
the toxicity and environmental impact caused by the discharge of untreated
industrial liquid wastes is long overdue and is a necessary precondition for
developing appropriate effluent standards and waste water management techniques.
Sector Organization
29.       The present organization of the sector is characterized by weak
institutions and inadequate financial provisions. Municipalities are re-
sponsible for the operation and maintenance of their sewer systems for which
financing is normally provided from general municipal income. Routine expan-
sions also fall under the responsibility of the municipalities and are usually
carried out by force account. The design and construction of new sewer systems
and major extensions to existing ones are carried out by private consultants
and contractors under the general supervision of the Ministry of Public Works
and are financed through government grants. The Government is aware of the
inadequacy of this situation and of the need for a central institution with
overall responsibility for the sector, capable of defining a national sewerage
policy and coordinating development programs. Since the Government wishes to
maintain responsibility for operation of water distribution and sewerage ne-
works within the municipalities, it has recently formed a sewerage unit within
the Ministry of the Interior, which is the Ministry responsible for supervising
the municipalities. This unit is responsible for planning the develop-
ment of the sector in conjunction with the Ministries of Public Works; Urban
Development, Housing, Tourism and Environment; Agriculture; and Health. Among
the issues under consideration, are the establishment of sewage tariffs for
domestic and industrial wastewaters, most probably in the form of a surcharge
on water tariffs, industrial wastewater management procedures, water quality
criteria for various bodies of water, general design criteria for wastewater
treatment and disposal, and the creation of autonomous municipal authorities
responsible for sewerage, either as independent authorities or within existing
autonomous municipal organizations (Regies) presently responsible for distri-
bution of water and of electric power. In the context of the spread of urban

growth across municipal boundaries, the Unit is to seek ways of coordinating
the development of urban sewer systems at a regional level, as would be the
case in the proposed project (see para 42).
30.       The Government has become increasingly aware of the need to assign
higher priority to developing the sewerage sector, in order to reduce'public
health hazards and to improve water usage. The 1978-82 Development Plan under
preparation, is expected to allocate a greater percentage of funds to sewerage.
Studies focusing on the provision of classical discharge and treatment facili-
ties are currently being prepared for Agadir (financed under Bank Loan No.
1202-MOR), Tangiers and Fez. The Agadir study would also include a preliminary
evaluation of the feasibility of using treated effluent for agricultural pur-
poses. If carefully developed, this approach could be applied advantageously
in various areas with limited water resources.
31.       The proposed loan would be the first direct Bank Group operation in
the sewerage sector and should lead to the preparation of a sewerage project
for which the Government has requested Bank financing. UNDP funds for Morocco
have been fully committed and there are no other readily available sources of
foreign exchange within Morocco, to finance these urgently needed studies on
-which the Government places high priority. As mentioned above (paragraph 30),
the Bank is financing a sewerage study for the city of Agadir as part of a
tourism development project for that city. Future Bank operations for urban
development would also contain sewerage components.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       The proposed engineering project was identified in November 1976.
The terms of reference were discussed and a draft proposal agreed upon in
Morocco in April 1977. Negotiations were held in Rabat in June 1977. The
Moroccan delegation was led by Mr. Belkoura of the Prime Minister's Office.
The Project Area
33.       The Casablanca-Mohammedia area is the largest urban and industrial
center of Morocco. Its present population is close to 2 million (about 30
percent of the total'urban population) and is growing at an annual rate in
excess of 4 percent. About one quarter of this population is estimated to live
in urban slums, the growth of which has been fueled by migration from rural
areas. In 1972, approximately half of the industrial establishments in Morocco
employing more than 10 worke'rs were located in this area, accounting for some
40 percent of total industrial employment. From the viewpoint of wastewater
pollution, the principal industries are paper, fertilizers, detergents, brewe-
ries, chemicals, cement, food and pharmaceuticals. The presence of all the
above factors renders this area particularly-suitable to serve as a model for
developing technical approaches'and institutional and financial policies that
could subsequently be replicated in other cities.



- 10 -
34.       Potable water for the project area is supplied by the Office National
de l'Eau Potable (ONEP). ONEP is a public sector agency under the supervision
of the Ministry of Public Works responsible for bulk supply of drinking water
throughout Morocco. Distribution of drinking water in the Project Area is
the responsibility of the Regie Autonome pour la Distribution de l'Eau et de
l'Electricite (RAD), an autonomous municipal agency. For the area as a whole,
it is estimated that 70 percent of the population is connected to the water
distribution systems; the remainder, including those living in slum areas,
have access to drinking water through vendors and public taps.
35.       Sewerage in Casablanca and Mohammedia is the responsibility of the
two municipalities. Central Casablanca is served by an integrated sewer net-
work covering an area of about 150 km2 and totalling some 1,000 km of sewers.
Other peripheral areas, including the coastal zone between Casablanca and
Mohammedia, are served by poorly defined networks which have been haphazardly
constructed in response to population growth. Most of the sewers are of the
combined type and suffer from heavy deposition during dry periods with the
inevitable generation of bad smells and bacterial growth. In general, the slum
areas around Casablanca have not been connected to the sewer network due to
their rapid growth and unfavorable topographical conditions. There is no sepa-
rate accounting for sewer charges, which are levied through a sewerage and
garbage collection surcharge included in property assessments; funds to cover
operational and maintenance costs of the sewerage system are allocated from
the municipal budget.
36.       Untreated industrial and domestic wastewaters which are discharged
together with stormwaters into the Atlantic Ocean at the shoreline by means
of numerous trunk mains and minor sewers are causing severe bacteriological
contamination of the coastal waters, visible nuisances and obnoxious smells
in the protected areas of the Casablanca harbor. As a consequence, the
attractive coastal area remains largely underdeveloped since bathing on
beaches of the region is hazardous. Also, at the request of the Ministry
of Health, fishing has been forbidden in most of the surf zone.
Project Objectives
37.       The primary objective of the project is to assist Morocco in the
development of design and planning criteria for upgrading urban sewer systems
in the Casablanca-Mohammedia area. The Project would lead to the establish-
ment of design criteria for wastewater collection, treatment and disposal
facilities; monitoring of receiving waters and industrial wastewater effluents;
development of domestic and industrial wastewater management practices and of
technical criteria for wastewater reclamation for agricultural and industrial
purposes and for possible use of sewage solids for soil conditioning; creation
of regional autonomous sewerage authorities; and establishment of adequate
sewerage charges for industrial and domestic wastewaters. The project would
thus directly assist the Government in implementing its long range program to
reorganize the sewerage sector. The scope of the project is intended to cover
the technical, financial and institutional aspects typical of urban sewerage
development over the medium-term. As such, it would provide the basis of



- 11 -
future studies and development projects to extend sewerage facilities both in
Casablanca and in other urban centers in Morocco.
Project Description
38.       The project would provide for two studies and the acquisition of
technical equipment as follows:
(i) Preparation of a feasibility study of the sewer system for
the Casablanca-Mohammedia area, including analyses of water
consumption and wastewater testings, projections of population,
wastewater flows and pollutant loadings; an oceanographic
survey to determine the ecological effects of exising proce-
dures for marine disposal of wastewaters; a technico-economic
analysis of wastewater reclamation for irrigation use and of
sewage utilization for soil conditioning; and preparation of a
sewerage master plan for the area, including construction cost
estimates and recommendations for a phased construction.
(ii) Detailed preparation of a priority project constituting the
first implementation stage of the sewerage master plan, includ-
ing preliminary designs and detailed construction cost esti-
mates for high-priority structures, financial projections for
the operation of the regional sewer system covering a ten year
period, proposals for the organization of the entity respon-
sible for the operation of the regional sewer system and for
sewer charges, and terms of reference for an oceanographic
baseline study of the coastal waters, for an in-depth survey
of industrial wastewaters and for a feasibility study for
reclaiming wastewaters for irrigation.
(iii) Acquisition of oceanography equipment for installation in a
naval vessel provided by the Government, to carry out oceano-
graphic surveys related to the preparation of the feasibility
study.
The project would be completed by October 1979. Information on the Project
appears in the Loan and Project Summary and in Annex III. There is no sepa-
rate appraisal report for this engineering Project, but a detailed descrip-
tion of the studies is given in the technical terms of reference presented
in Annex IV, a Technical Appendix.
Feasibility Study
39.       The feasibility study would include the collection of basic data
relating to the Casablanca-Mohammedia sewer systems and wastewater charac-
teristics, thereby permitting specific identification of issues and areas
requiring further analysis.   It would analyze the economic and environmental
advantages of constructing separate wastewater collection systems in various
parts of the Project area. It would lead to the preparation of a regional



- 12 -
sewerage master plan to provide an overall framework for future sewerage devel-
opment in the project area. Major activities would be the determination of the
quantities, composition and variations of domestic and industrial wastewater
flows and an oceanographic study of the impact of present sewerage practices
on the marine environment. In order to carry out the oceanographic study, the
Government has agreed to make available for at least 30 effective working days
a fully manned naval vessel which would be equipped under the Project (Section
3.02(b), draft Loan Agreement). The vessel thus equipped would subsequently be
available to carry out an ocean monitoring program (see para 40), as well as
other oceanograhic surveys required in Morocco.    A better knowledge of these
parameters, is essential to establish appropriate measures for controlling pol-
lution and proposing adequate treatment of wastewaters. These studies would
also underpin analyses of the advantages of wastewater reclamation and use of
sewage solids (see para. 41). The consultants in conjunction with the Sewerage
Unit in the Ministry of the Interior (para 29) would be responsible for devel-
oping work methodologies which could be adopted and implemented elsewhere in
Morocco. The sewerage master plan, drafts of which would be submitted to the
Government and the Bank for review and comment, would form the basis for future
policy discussions.
Preparation Study
40.       Following the completion of the above study, the Project envisages
preparation, to Bank standards, of a high priority project which would consti-
tute the first phase of the Sewerage Master Plan and which would include the
construction of treatment facilities, submarine outfalls and expansions of the
sewer network. Particular attention would be given to evaluate institutional
and financial aspects and to identify legislative action and training needs.
The Government has agreed to consult with the Bank on the conclusions of the
feasibility study and thereafter, to provide the consultants with the institu-
tional and financial assumptions required to carry out the preparation of the
first stage project (Section 3.02d(ii), draft Loan Agreement). The study
would also include the preparation of terms of reference for two specialized
studies to be carried out in the Project area: (i) an oceanographic base-line
study to be used in establishing a monitoring program of ocean water quality
in the vicinity of the submarine outfalls and (ii) an in-depth study of the
main industrial polluters to determine appropriate in-plant measures, pollution
standards and industrial sewerage charges.
41.       Possibilities for wastewater reclamation for irrigation and use of
sewage solids for soil conditioning would be studied with a view to future
implementation. At present, while wastewater reclamation for irrigation
appears economically attractive because of the scarcity of water in the
Casablanca Region, such a program could not be implemented due to lack of
adequate controls over industrial liquid wastes. The design of the treatment
facilities to be proposed would allow the addition of reclamation facilities
at a later date. These, however, would not replace the need for ocean disposal
of wastewaters as agricultural use of reclaimed waters would only be seasonal.
This staged approach should provide sufficient time to Government to implement
adequate industrial wastewater management procedures and establish a reliable
monitoring of industrial effluents. The engineering project would also in-
clude the preparation of terts of reference for a pilot wastewater reclamation



- 13 -
facility to serve a well-chosen watershed where industrial liquid wastes are
considered to be free of toxicants and substances likely to inhibit biological
treatment processes.
Project Execution
42.       The Ministry of the Interior, through its recently created Sewerage
Unit, and the Prefecture of Casablanca which has direct control over the two
municipalities of Casablanca and Mohammedia, would have primary responsibility
for the execution of the project which would be carried out by a firm of exper-
ienced and qualified consultants selected on terms and conditions acceptable
to the Bank. The hiring of these consultants would be a condition of effec-
tiveness of the proposed loan (see Section 5.01, draft Loan Agreement). It is
expected that the feasibility study could be completed by the end of 1978,
which would permit the preparation of the first-stage project to be completed
before the end of 1979. A report entitled, "Supplementary Information to
Consultants" specifying details on preparation, submission and evaluation of
proposals, work schedules, award of contract, and other details pertaining to
the execution of the studies has been reviewed and agreed upon. Invitations
to submit proposals would only be sent to a short list of consultants prequali-
fied by the Government with the agreement of the Bank.
43.       During project execution, the consultants would submit bi-monthly
progress reports to the Government, which in turn would submit them to the Bank.
Their final reports would be submitted in draft to permit review by the Govern-
ment and the Bank and incorporation of their comments into the final report.
44.       Although no formal training component is included in the project,
two experienced sanitary engineers have been designated to work closely with
the consultants, one in the Sewerage Unit of the Ministry of the Interior who
would be principally responsible for issues that require consideration at
the national level, and the second in the Casablanca Prefecture who would be
mainly concerned with issues affecting the Project area. From the day to day
exposure to the work of specialists, these engineers would receive training
in the various fields covered by the studies. It is also expected that the
execution of the project would allow for a more precise identification of
training requirements.
Project Costs
45.       The total project cost is estimated at $2.5 million including
physical and price contingencies. The proposed engineering loan would finance
foreign costs estimated at $1.5 million, with the local costs being provided
by the Government. A breakdown of total project costs is presented below.

The estimated cost covers 237 man-months of technical personnel, including the
project manager, engineers and technicians, and 96 man-months of supporting
administrative and clerical local personnel. The average cost of consultant
services for technical personnel would amount to $5,480 per man-month includ-
ing the consulting firm's overhead and profit. Physical contingencies of 10
percent and price contingencies based on an annual cost escalation of 12 per-
cent have been included.
Procurement and Disbursement
46.       The consultants would be paid on a man-months basis.   Oceanographic
equipment would be procured on the basis of quotation obtained from at least
three international suppliers, local or foreign. The loan would be disbursed
against 100 percent of foreign expenditures. It is expected to be fully dis-
bursed by the end of 1979, according to the following schedule of estimated
disbursements:

Project Justification and Risk
47.       The Project would make a major contribution in assisting the Govern-
ment to achieve its long range objectives of strengthening and reorganizing
the sewerage sector both through the preparation of a priority project for
possible Bank financing and through studies leading to the establishment of
appropriate technical standards, financial policies and institutional arrange-
ments. The studies would provide Government with a viable sewerage proposal
for the Casablanca-Mohammedia area and with data and recommendations on sector
planning, tariff policy, industrial wastewater management and water quality
criteria. These measures are essential to reduce the public health hazards
and the risks to fisheries deriving from the growing pollution of coastal
waters. At the central Government level it would outline the objectives of
the Sewerage Unit established in the Ministry of the Interior and improve the
project analysis and policy formulation capacity of this Unit. At the muni-
cipal level it would provide recommendations for strengthening the management
and the technical and financial capacity of sewerage authorities. The Govern-
ment is interested in this Project and its full support will be needed for
implementing the proposals of the sophisticated studies. The Project faces no
special risks. A detailed work plan for the consultants will be prepared in
accordance with the agreed technical terms of reference and the Government has
agreed to give special consideration to the technical capacity of the consul-
tant staff so as to minimize the risk of the studies not meeting the project
objectives.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Kingdom of Morocco and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for under Article III, Section 4
(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
49.       Features of the Agreement of special interest are summarized in
Annex III. The hiring of consultants for the Project is a condition of loan
effectiveness.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

13, 1969; Date of Effectiveness: June 8, 1970; Closing Date:
November 30, 1978.
Progress in implementing the project is now satisfactory although
considerable problems were first experienced with management and procurement,
of canalettes, and some procurement difficulties continue. The major project
structure, Idriss ler Dam, is completed and 27,200 ha out of a total of
35,700 ha are already equipped and will be completed for irrigation before
June 1977. Additional infrastructure for the project area, including a sugar
cane processing factory and flood protection works, are being provided by
Loan No. 1018-MOR.
Cr. No. 266 Second Education Project: US$8.5 million Credit of August 18,
1971; Date of Effectiveness: December 10, 1971;
Closing Date: April 30, 1978.
The project included the expansion and improvement of specific
sections of the secondary, vocational and higher educational systems, and
technical assistance for project administration and school maintenance.
Subsequently, the Association agreed not to finance two Vocational Training
Centers and the Department of Veterinary Medicine. Accordingly, an amount
of about US$0.9 million has been transferred to the unallocated category for
future reallocation and/or cancellation. Initial delays occurred in the
appointment of consultant architects, in the recruitment of local personnel
and technical assistance experts for the Project Unit and in procurement.
However, execution is now proceeding satisfactorily. Physical execution of
the project is forecast for completion by the end of 1977.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read -in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
Studies for the Sewerage of the Casablanca-Mohammedia Region
Technical Terms of Reference
I.   Introduction
1.1       The Government of Morocco intends to retain the services of con-
sultants to conduct a feasibility study of the sewerage for the Casablanca
and Mohammedia Region and, on the basis of such study, to prepare a high-
priority first-stage project covering the sewerage facilities which should
be constructed in the immediate future.
2.   Objectives
2.1       The objectives of the studies are fourfold:
(a) To improve the existing procedures for the marine disposal
of the wastewaters through the design of submarine outfalls
and treatment facilities.
(b) To reduce pollution through adequate control of the discharge
of liquid industrial wastes.
(c) To project and stage the future development of the sewer system.
(d) To prepare a high-priority first-stage project which can be
constructed during a period not to exceed 5 years and which
can be presented to international financing organizations.
3.   Feasibility Study - Work to be Carried Out by the Consultants
3.1       Reconnaissance of the existing sewer system including:
General description of the system;
Areas served in the various sectors of the region;
Topography, plan, profile and capacity of main interceptors;
Identification of watersheds;
Description and details of main sewer facilities.
3.2       Projections of population, water consumption and wastewater flows
for the various sectors of the city, at 5 years intervals, up to the year
2000, on the basis of historical data available and of proposed future land
use. Wastewater flow projections will indicate average and peak domestic,
industrial and infiltration flows as well as storm flows for the combined
systems.

TECHNICAL APPENDIX
Page 2
3.3       Testing of no less than twenty 24-hour composite samples of domestic
sewage and of at least one composite sample of the effluent of each one of the
main industries. All the tests will include determination of BOD5 (biochemical
oxygen demand), COD (chemical oxygen demand), suspended solids, total Kjendahl
nitrogen and phosphates. In addition, the tests of industrial effluents will
include determination of the pollutants inherent to the industry, especially
heavy metals and other substances known to be toxic to fish or liable to
inhibit biological treatment processes.
3.4       Projections of wastewater strengths and pollutant loadings for
relevant periods. List of the main potential industrial polluters and pre-
liminary recommendations for eliminating or reducing their discharge of
toxic substance and/or inhibitors.
3.5       Based on analyses of rainfall records and on the projections of
wastewater and runoff volume and strength the consultants will carry out:
(a)  a comparative study of the polluting effects caused by the
discharges of urban runoff and of combined overflows into
the surf zone of the ocean during different seasons of
the year;
(b)  an estimate of the volumes of interception of combined
flows which would be required to maintain various (at least
3 options) qualities of waters in the surf zone and the
harbor area.
3.6       Based on the studies described in 3.5 above, plus economic compara-
tive studies the consultants will determine the areas where the existing
combined system should be separated by constructing new storm or wastewater
interceptors.
3.7       Preliminary design of the coastal interceptors required to capture
the wastewaters and carry them to the submarine outfalls.
3.8       Bathimetric surveys and borings of the submarine subsoil to deter-
mine the optimum alignment of the submarine outfalls. At the points of
outfall discharge measurements of:
(a)  dissolved oxygen, density, temperature and salinity throughout
the water column to estimate the degree of water stratification
and the depth of pynoclines or thermoclines at different times
of the year;
(b) ocean currents at various water depths;
(c) dispersion patterns by means of drift cards and flourescent dyes.

with treated effluent with special consideration to the greenbelt proposed in
the master plan for the urban development of Casablanca. Estimate of the
flows which could be used for irrigation during the various seasons of the
year.
3.12      Determination of the degree of treatment which would be required
initially and in the future to maintain effluent quantities compatible with
marine disposal and various types of agricultural use.
3.13      Determination of the lowest cost treatment-disposal solution for
the safe discharge into the sea of the wasterwater flows expected up to about
1990 but which allows treatment upgrading for the future use of the effluent
for agricultural purposes. Economic analysis of the future use of adequately
treated sewage solids for soil conditioning. For studying the future use of
effluent and sewage solids, it will be assumed that by 1990 industry will be
complying with sensible effluent standards. Technico-economical study of
possible alternatives including for each alternative:
(a) a general plan of the sewer system indicating construction
