PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUTBLIC OF YEMEN
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
1.01     A transport sector memorandum was distributed on November 29, 1979
(Report No. 2750-YDR) and should be consulted for all general data on the
transport system and issues concerning the sector.
A. Socio-Economic Development and Transport Needs
1.02     Apart froin the city of Aden (population 270,000), the 1.8 million
inhabitants of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) are con-
centrated in a few scattered areas, separated by considerable distances of
empty desert and arid mountains. Cultivated areas account only for 0.2% of
the country's total land area (290,000 km2).  The standard of living is
low. Per capita GNP in 1979 is estimated at US$500 mainly due to remit-
tances from emigrated workers; GDP per capita (i.e. excluding these remit-
tances) is estimated at US$350. Rural populations are to a large degree
self-sufficient, depending on small-scale agriculture, where water is
available.
1.03     At independence in 1967, there were only about 200 km of inter-
urban paved roads, mostly in and around Aden.  The rest of the country was
served by tracks or limited air services, using unpaved airstrips. Tradi-
tional dhows plied between the two ports, Aden and Mukalla. Since 1967 the
Government has concentrated a substantial part of national development
efforts to develop transport facilities, aiming at integrating the princi-
pal populated areas. Roads have been the primary means to achieve this,
since there are virtually no natural harbors to facilitate coastal shipp-
ing, railways are impracticable due to the rugged terrain and aviation is
constrained by its high cost. Road investments are coordinated with in-
vestments in agriculture, fisheries or other productive potentials in the
areas to be served.
1.04     As a result of these efforts, many parts of PDRY are now experi-
encing significant improvements in their accessability. Road transport
accounts for about 90% of total passenger and freight traffic. Only the
Shabwah Governorate (population 100,000) and the Al Gheidah Governorate
(population 70,000) still face major transport difficulties. The proposed
project addresses the needs of the Shabwah Governorate, of which the
capital is Ataq.
B. Transport Policy, Planning and Coordination
1.05     The Government continues to attach considerable importance to the
role transport improvements can play in promoting the economic, social and



- 2 -
administrative integration of the widely scattered populated areas of the
country. This policy calls for good communications between Aden and
Mukalla, by road and by sea for freight and by road and by air for passpn-
gers, and between each of these cities and the agricultural areas of their
respective hinterlands, mostly by road. State-owned organizations have
primary responsibility for developing transport services in shipping and
civil aviation, and have begun to take over from the private sector in road
transport. As a general principle, transport tariffs are set by the
Government, including those to be charged by privately owned trucks and
taxis, at levels that will cover average operating costs while assuring
uniformity of rates for like services.
1.06     The sector allocation to transport under the First Five-Year Plan
(1974-78) has been comparatively high, reflecting the Government's concern
to integrate the country: planned at 21%, transport projects actually
absorbed 27% of total development outlays. The sector also has a good per-
formance record: actual expenditures rose an average of 50% per year from
1974 to 1978 and the ratio of actual to planned expenditures over the five
years was at the commendably high level of 82%, compared to 71% for all
sectors combined. The transport sector allocation under the ongoing Second
Five-Year Plan (1979-83),a! is about YD 70 million, representing with 19%
a somewhat smaller but still important share of total development expendi-
tures.  Current budget allocations for public works and communications (of
which road maintenance is a major item) have been only about 4% of the
national current budget. The main reason is that most of the investment
program is financed by external lenders, whilst the current budget relies
on the limited internal resources. As a result, realization of any plan
depends on the Government's ability to attract foreign financing.
1.07     Three ministries are responsible for the main aspects of the
transport system: The Ministry of Construction (MOC) for main roads, Com-
munications for road transport services, shipping and aviation, and Plann-
ing (MOP) for coordinating the planning of investments in the sector. The
MOP's director for transport cooperates with the modal ministries in the
preparation of new projects and advises on their integration into the
national investment plan. Furthermore, the Ministry of Local Affairs is
responsible for construction and maintenance of local roads, subject to the
technical appraisal of the MOC. Current issues of road transport affecting
both the Ministries of Construction and Communications, such as vehicle
axle load limits, are adequately coordinated informally by officials of the
two ministries concerned. Technical assistance to the MOC, financed under
the Second Highway Project, advised on, among other things, the economic
aspects of intermodal competition.
a/ The Government is changing to a decade-based planning system (1981-85)
in conformity with neighboring Arab countries. As a result 1979 and
1980 are transition years. The 1981-85 plan is still under preparation.

C. Previous Projects
1.08     The First Highway Project, for which Credit 240-YDR  of US$1.6
million was signed in April 1971 (IDA's first operation in PDRY), helped to
improve the operation and administration of the highway-related activities
of the then Ministry of Public Works (MPW) and to prepare future high
priority road construction projects.  It comprised feasibility studies,
procurement of maintenance equipment, technical assistance to the Ministry
with emphasis on maintenance and workshop operations, and fellowships for
MPW staff.  Project implementation was satisfactory, with a cost underrun
of 5%. However, completion was about two years later than planned, due to
delays in procuring the equipment, partly through the Government's unfamil-
iarity with IDA procurement guidelines (see Project Performance Audit
Report of March 13, 1978). Also, the institutional impact of the technical
assistance was affected by the shortage of qualified counterpart staff but
a valuable start was made. As the Project Performance Audit Report con-
cluded, this experience demonstrated the continued effort generally re-
quired over several successive projects for institution building and imple-
mentation of recommendations for operational improvement.
1.09     The feasibility studies under the First Highway Project, extended
under Engineering Credit S-12 YDR for US$560,000 of November 1972, made
possible the preparation of a Second Highway Project, for which a credit of
US$15.5 million was approved in June 1975. Its major component is the con-
struction of the Mukalla-Wadi Hadramawt road. The project's total cost of
US$31.8 million (US$20.8 million in foreign exchange) is financed jointly
by IDA (Credit 560-YDR), the Kuwait Fund (US$15.3 million equivalent) and
the Government (US$1.0 million). The project also includes feasibility
studies and detailed engineering of the Naqabah-Ataq-Nisab-Beihan road,
which provided the basis for the construction component of the proposed
project; purchases of a modest amount of highway maintenance equipment and
spare parts; technical assistance to the MOC in transport economics, and
fellowships. This project provided valuable experience in the procurement
of civil works: after international competitive bidding failed to attract
any reasonable bid, the Government in agreement with the co-financiers set
up a semi-autonomous construction unit under an expatriate management team
that is performing well. The success of this unit led the Government to
adopt the same approach for other road construction works. Experience with
the other project components is also generally good. This notwithstanding
that the project is expected to be completed in December 1982 about 37
months behind schedule. There were delays caused by an unsuccessful inter-
national tender and the mobilization was slow due to the initial inexperi-
ence of the construction unit. Also the construction period had to be ex-
tended to complete the work with the equipment available to the Government.
1.10     The only other IDA project in the transport sector is one to help
the Port of Aden benefit from the reopening of the Suez Canal. IDA and the
Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD) are co-financing a
US$17.6 million project to rehabilitate the port, through assistance to the



Port of Aden Authority, the National Shipping Company and the National
Dockyard Company. The project is relatively straightforward, consisting of
replacement and procurement of various kinds of equipment, together with
technical assistance and minor civil works. IDA is providing US$3.2 mil-
lion under Credit 584--YDR signed in September 1975, the AFESD US$13.6 mil-
lion equivalent and the Government US$0.8 million equivalent. No major
difficulties have been encountered. All items of equipment included in the
project have been received and are in use except for certain items of navi-
gational equipment and workshop equipment. The project is expected to be
completed toward the end of 1981, about 36 months behind schedule because
of the slow recruitment of technical advisors under the project, hired for
costing and training.
II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01     The backbone of the PDRY road network (Annex 1) is the 620-km long
coastal road from Aden to Mukalla, which was started from Aden in the mid-
1960s and completed to Mukalla in 1977. One other arterial road is paved,
that from Aden to the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) border near Taiz (about 100
km), though 65 km of it are in poor condition and are being rehabilitated
(para. 2.12). The asphalt roads in and around Aden and other short
stretches mostly in the western governorates, bring the total length of
asphalted roads in 1980 to about 1,200 km or 20% of the network. There are
also 255 km of cobblestone roads, mostly in the Wadi Hadramawt, some of
them built in the 1930s and some in the 1970s. The rest of the network is
made up of about 4,400 km of tracks, most of which are not engineered but
merely shaped by the vehicles themselves along wadi beds, across the
desert, or along the beach. Many of these tracks are cut by flash floods
and dune movements at different times of the year, and with few exceptions
are only passable by four-wheel drive passenger vehicles and trucks.
2.02     The density of the road network (20 km per thousand square km) is
three-quarters that of PDRY's immediate neighbors YAR and Oman, which have
similar terrain. The length of paved roads in relation to population (0.7
km per thousand inhabitants) is approximately double that of YAR, but the
long distances between scattered populated areas mean that total transpor-
tation costs between centers will always be relatively high and a deterrent
to trade and mobility.
2.03     Construction of new roads is proceeding at about 120 km of as-
phalted and 10 km of cobbled road per year, representing an annual growth
rate in the asphalted system of 16%.
B. Traffic and Road Transport
2.04     Only limited information is available on traffic volumes on the
road network; nowhere are they high. The generally low traffic volumes,
even on the paved roads, reflect not only the difficulties of terrain and



- 5 -
the long distances between communities but also the modest size of the
vehicle fleet. Sample counts taken by the MOC's Road Study Unit in 1976
and 1977 were 700 to 1,500 vehicles per day (vpd) on the paved roads in the
relatively densely populated agricultural areas close to Aden, and below
300 vpd on paved and cobbled roads further from Aden. Few tracks carry
more than 100 vpd. Ad hoc traffic counts, taken in 1979-80, show a higher
growth rate than the previous years, consistent with the growth of the
motor vehicle fleet (para. 2.05) and fuel consumption (Table 2). Except in
the immediate vicinity of towns, the percentage of trucks is consistently
high, 40-50% of traffic.
2.05     Based on registration data and observed volumes the fleet was
estimated at about 13,000 vehicles in 1977, about 7 per thousand inhabit-
ants. Relief in import duties, previously 200%, for civil servants and
Yemenis working abroad, boosted vehicle imports in 1979-80. As a result
the 1980 vehicle fleet is estimated at 20,000 vehicles (5,200 passenger
cars, 500 buses and 14,300 trucks of all sizes), which implies an annual
growth rate of 15% since 1977. Distances driven per year are low due to
the poor quality of much of the road network and the lack of adequate
vehicle maintenance through shortage of spare parts and skilled mechanics.
These factors cause many vehicles to be out of action for long periods
and/or to be scrapped after relatively short working lives. The training
of automotive mechanics under the IDA Second Education Project and the
MOC's training center (para. 2.31) will alleviate this serious problem.
2.06     Public passenger transport is controlled by the Public Corporation
for Land Transport (PCLT), a parastatal organization attached to the Minis-
try of Communications. It operates the main bus services and closely re-
gulates the operation of privately owned taxis and four-wheel drive vehi-
cles for public passenger transport. Fares are high, due to high operating
costs and overheads and to the large number of inoperative vehicles.
2.07     Most Government corporations and agencies operate their own truck
fleets, such as the Public Corporation for Marketing of Fruit and Vegeta-
bles or the National Company for Home Trade, which is responsible for
marketing all cereals. Common-carrier trucking is still predominantly in
the hands of private owner-operators, under close regulation by the PCLT.
The PCLT has also recently established its own fleet of trucks, aiming at
eventually taking over all common-carrier trucking from the private sector.
2.08     To improve PCLT operations the Government started in 1978-80 a
series of actions, namely: (i) a central workshop being built in Aden to
improve maintenance, increase fleet utilization and improve service; (ii) a
study by the Ministry of Communications on transport demands in the dif-
ferent governorates, with due attention to the required support facilities;
and (iii) consultants' studies under the Second Highway Project to analyse
road transport services with particular attention to rates; this study made
recommendations for improving PCLT's operations and cost accounting, which
are currently under examination by the Government.

C. Administration
2.09     Responsibility for the road network is divided between the MOC,
which is in charge of the construction and maintenance of the asphalted
roads, and the governorate authorities, under the supervision of the Minis-
try of Local Affairs, who maintain the rest of the network and carry out
small-scale construction works, subject to technical approval of MOC.
2.10     The MOC was reorganized in 1979 as a result of studies in 1978-79
to review functions and internal work relations (para. 2.28). The MOC now
comprises four main departments:  (i) administration, (ii) engineering,
(iii) the highway authority (HA), and (iv) corporations. The HA is res-
ponsible for construction and maintenance of roads, while the department
for corporations supervises public enterprises for road construction, in-
dustrial installations, carpentry, ship building, housing and buildings.
The department's supervision covers investment programs, review of con-
tracts, procurement of equipment and materials and labor hiring. An
organization chart is attached.
D. Planning
2.11     Road investment planning is carried out at two levels in the MOC:
(i) the Planning Unit, reporting directly to the Minister, advises on
policy issues, is responsible for sectoral planning in the MOC and provides
coordination with the Ministry of Planning; and (ii) the Road Planning Unit
of the HA, responsible for the more technical aspects of project prepara-
tion including organizing traffic counts and liaising with consultants
carrying out feasibility and detailed engineering studies.
2.12     Under the Second Highway Project (1977-78), consultants financed
from the credit account assisted the HA in traffic counting and feasibility
studies in preparation of the five-year plan (1979-83), which includes con-
struction of the proposed Naqabah-Nisab road. Road constructions to be
completed or started during the plan are listed in Table 2.1.

2.13     The current road development plan aims at interconnecting with a
paved system the two most important urban centers (Aden and Mukalla) and
the four most populated areas with short-term development potential (Wadis
Tuban, Abyan, Beihan and Hadramawt), while North and South Yemen would be
connected by an improved road between Aden and Taiz. These would satisfy
the most immediate objectives and basic requirements for PDRY's national
economic integration. The program, however, is about double the corres-
ponding amount under the previous 1974-78 plan (Table 2.2) and is placing
considerable demands on the Government both as to financing (para. 1.06)
and implementation capability (para. 2.23).

2.15     Because of the shortage of domestically generated resources (para.
1.06), construction projects have had to be financed with extensive ex-
ternal assistance, the Government often contributing less than 10% of total
project cost. The People's Republic of China lent an estimated US$20 mil-
lion towards the cost of the Aden-Mukalla road. The Mukalla-Wadi Hadramawt
road is jointly being financed by IDA and KFAED, while the Aden-Taiz road
improvement is being financed entirely by the AFESD at a cost of about -
US$20 million for the section within PDRY. The Association is also financ-
ing the construction of cobblestone feeder roads under its two agricultural
projects: US$1.9 million under the Wadi Hadramawt Project (1976) and
US$100,000 under the Wadi Tuban Project (1978).  Other assistance has been
received from th- German Democratic Republic, the USSR, Hungary and the
World Food PrograTme (WFP) (Table 4).
2.16     Road maintenance has also relied heavily on external sources.
Nearly half the totai maintenance outlays for the 1974-78 Plan period came
from the World Food Programme, mostly in the form of food distributed to
the force-account laborers (see Table 2.2). Another 20% came out of the
capital budget and only 30% from the current budget. The Government does
not levy taxes on government-owned vehicles and does not earmark for road
expenditures the taxes and other charges it levies on private-sector road
users. The latter pay fuel taxes, vehicle license fees and customs duties
on vehicles and spare parts that amount to less than half the annual high-
way expenditures.
F. Engineering
2.17     The MOC's engineering department carries out highway design on
small construction projects to the extent possible with its limited quali-
fied staff. In this task it has received valuable assistance from two UNDP
technical advisers. Major designs such as the Mukalla-Wadi Hadramawt and
Naqabah-Nisab-Beihan roads are carried out by consultants or a bilateral
aid team. This arrangement has worked satisfactorily.
2.18     Following the guidelines prepared under IDA's First Highway Pro-
ject, the Government aims for the following standards for national roads:
Class I, 7 m asphalt pavement for roads with average daily
traffic above 1000 vehicles; and
Class II, 6 m asphalt pavement, which is the predominant category,
making up 90% of the current asphalted system.
However, design standards are frequently lowered during preparation and
implementation and tailored to the economic and social needs commensurate
with the financial means. Strict adherence to design standards recommended
by consultants and high cost of construction because of unavailability of
construction capacity would resulted in reduced economic viability, while
the costs would exceeded the financial resources of the Government.



- 10 -
2.19     Under the provisions of the Second Highway Project, the Government
undertook to enact by June 1977 legislation to limit the weights and dimen-
sions of vehicles using the national road system.  Pending the recommenda-
tions of the consultants, the Government effectively enforced the existing
7.7-ton axle-load limit. In 1980 upon recommendations by consultants under
the Second Highway Project, the Government adopted the 13-ton limit in
conformity with neighboring Saudi Arabia and YAR. Pavement design for all
roads under construction takes account of this 13-ton limit. During credit
negotiations assurances were obtained from the Government that it shall
take, in conformity with its regulations all measures necessary to ensure
at all times that the dimension and axle loads of vehicles using its roads                   *
do not exceed limits consistent with the design standards of such roads.
G. Construction
2.20     Since 1974, when the first road improvement programs were started,
the Government has attempted to implement its road investment programs with
the assistance of foreign contractors. These attempts until now have
failed because bids received from foreign contractors under international
competitive bidding were unrealistically high. These attempts included:

2.21     The lack of sufficient construction programs to ensure continuity
appears to be the main reason for the limited interest shown by foreign
contractors and for the high bids. This, combined with the physical and
political conditions of the country and the low productivity 6f the labor
force, results in the high bids submitted by foreign contractors. The con-
tractors, furthermore, are attracted to the richer neighboring countries,
where high construction costs are acceptable if combined with high quality
work. Because of the limited financial means of PDRY, as for any country
in similar conditions, the Government cannot afford to hire these foreign
contractors for the implementation of its investment programs and therefore
has taken the only realistic alternative available, namely to develop its
own construction capacity. Some exceptions have occurred and foreign con-
tractors have operated in PDRY, namely a West German contractor for the
Mukalla port and an Indian contractor for the Riyan airport. The German
contractor, however, went bankrupt in 1979.
2.22     As a result of these unsuccessful tenders and because negotiations
with the contractors to reduce costs were unsuccessful the Government, in
agreement with the various donors, has set up on an ad hoc basis road con-
struction units, carrying out the works either by force-account or unit
rate contracts, under various organizational arrangements:
(i) with bilateral assistance from China in the form of equip-
ment, technical staff and technicians (Am Ayn-Mukalla and As
Shihr-Sayhut);
(ii) by MOC construction units managed by management consultants
with separate accounts (Mukalla-Wadi Hadramawt and Aden-YAR
border); and
(iii) by self-managed MOC construction units (Shuqra-Am Ayn,
Shuqra-Ahwar, Nobat Dukeim-Kersh), supported by WFP dona-
tions of food and some cash.
The quality of construction is generally satisfactory and, as the units
gain practical experience, it is improving. The construction units managed
by expatriate management consultants are the most productive and have shown
adequate results: an increase in productivity over the years and generally
good quality of work. The construction units have built about 1,000 km of
roads since 1974.
2.23     There are now four construction units:  Mukalla-Wadi Hadramawt,
Aden-YAR border, Shuqra-Ahwar, Ash Shihr-Sayhut. A fifth was established
by ministerial resolution of March 24, 1981 for Naqabah-Nisab. These
construction units operate independently under the supervision of the
General Directorate for Corporations (para. 2.10). Most of these units
have been operating on a force-account basis, but the Government has now
decided, in view of the continued high bids by foreign contractors that the
construction units should work as regular contractors in order to establish
and strengthen adequate construction capabilities for implementing the road



- 12 -
investment and maintenance programs in an efficient and economical manner,
as well as any other civil work programs proposed by the regions covered by
each of these construction units.
2.24     As evidenced by the latest bidding (para. 2.20), the results of
competitive bidding including foreign contractors are improving. With in-
creasing investments in road construction and other construction projects,
and taking into account the increasing capacity of the national construc-
tion industry, competitive bidding among foreign and public contractors may
improve in future years. Furthermore as a result of the increasing capa-
city of the construction units and the strengthening of their management
(para. 3.08), construction costs are expected to stabilize at levels com-
parable to construction costs in other countries in similar condition.
However, for the proposed Naqabah-Nisab road, the creation of a new con-
struction unit was the only practical alternative at this stage.
2.25     The Government has requested that technical assistance be included
under the project to strengthen MOC and the General Directorate for Corpo-
rations. This technical assistance, which would assist the MOC in super-
vising the various construction units would also carry out construction
supervision of the Naqabah-Nisab road. Experience on the Naqabah-Nisab
road would be used to improve the supervisory activities of MOC over the
other construction units.
H. Maintenance
2.26     Thanks to a substantial and continuing effort over the past seven
years, the MOC is now carrying out highway maintenance at a level of about
US$500 equivalent per km per year on the asphalt system and amounts varying
from year to year between US$300 and US$500 equivalent per km on the rest
of the network (including minor improvements). These expenditures are
adequate for the type of construction applied in PDRY in relation to total
resources.
2.27     Under a covenant of the First Highway Project, the Government more
than doubled its allocation of funds to maintenance, supplemented by equip-
ment, spare parts and technical assistance financed from the Credit. Fur-
ther assistance in the form of maintenance equipment and spare parts was
provided under the Kuwait Fund contribution to the Second Highway Project
and maintenance is now adequate, especially in view of the limited paved
network.
2.28     Most of the unpaved network has little or no engineering and most
of the maintenance effort is carried out on an ad hoc basis by governorate
forces, funded by the WFP.
2.29     The MOC is preparing for the decentralization of the maintenance
process, once the paved network will reach the targets set for the
mid-1980's and has; (i) set up small pilot units in two governorates for
asphalt road maintenance (mostly for sand and rockfall removals and for



- 13 -
shoulder repairs); (ii) transferred items of maintenance equipment to the
control of governorates for use on unpaved roads; and (iii) commissioned
consultants to conduct a study on possible reorganization of the MOC, in-
cluding its maintenance operations. MOC is considering to entrust mainte-
nance operations on a contract basis to the construction units, established
in the various governorates. During credit negotiations the Government
expressed interest in seeking IDA participation for preparation of a road
maintenance project.
I. Training
2.30      The MOC remains understaffed at all management levels.  Practical
experience is limited but building up as MOC handles more construction.
On-the-job training under the First Highway Project (September 1971 to
December 1974) and by bilateral technical assistance to the mechanical
workshops produced successful results with the few Yemeni candidates that
were found. Also between 1971 and 1975, a UNDP grant and bilateral sources
provided 16 overseas fellowships ranging in duration from two to thirty
months for mid-level management and specialized trade candidates; the re-
sults were mixed mainly because of language difficulties. Eight fellow-
ships under the Second Highway Project training element are completed and
others are being financed by the AFESD. The training program enhances
MOC's theoretical and practical capabilities at middle management level.
2.31     MOC attaches value to overseas training and continues to seek
financing for these fellowships from various sources, this time particular-
ly for construction and maintenance supervisors and site managers. Post-
graduate training of MOC staff is included in the project (para. 3.09).
2.32     The acute shortage of skilled manpower, due in part to extensive
emigration towards better paid jobs in the neighboring Gulf States, con-
tinues to hamper implementation of all projects in PDRY. To overcome this
shortage in the construction sector, the Government established a training
center under the supervision of MOC in 1977, with the bilateral assistance
of the USSR. The center trains skilled workers in the following fields:
electrical installations, carpentry, vehicle maintenance, equipment opera-
tors, equipment maintenance, welding, concrete reinforcement, plumbing,
masonry, surveying and drafting. Some of the courses run over a two-year
period while some others are only scheduled on an ad hoc basis in response
to demand. The total capacity of the center is 300 trainees of which 200
for a one-year course and 100 for a two-year course.  The center operates
with eight expatriate and 20 local instructors and reached full-capacity
operation in 1980-81; 50 trainees graduated in 1978, 100 in 1979 and 210 in
1980. All trainees have been absorbed without difficulty in the public and
private sectors.
2.33     At the same time, MOC realizes the continuing need for on-the-job
training, in all aspects of management and operation of a construction
unit.  Accordingly, the project contains a suitable element to meet this
need (para. 3.09).

III. THE PROJECT
A. Background
3.01     In June 1978, the Government proposed a project consisting of:
(i) construction of a two-lane paved road from Naqabah (on the Aden-Mukalla
road) to Nisab with a branch to As Said (total length 92 km); (ii) purchase
of maintenance equipment and spares; (iii) technical assistance to MOC; and
(iv) feasibility studies. Processing of the project, however, was sus-
pended in late 1978 when cost estimates based on completed detailed engine-
ering increased two-fold, thereby rendering the project premature. To firm
up the cost estimates, the Government called for bids, which were received
February 28, 1980. Six bids from five foreign contractors and one national
independent construction unit organized as a contractor, were received.
All bids substantially exceeded the updated cost estimates. The Government
initiated negotiations with the lowest bidder aiming at reducing overall
costs through substantial changes in the project design. These
negotiations were completed in September 1980, upon which the Government
submitted the proposed project for appraisal. Maintenance equipment was
deleted from the project since equipment had been supplied from other
sources and MOC was considering entrusting maintenance operations to the
various construction units set up in the governorates. Studies were
likewise deleted since they would be financed from other sources. The
project was appraised in October 1980.
B. Objectives
3.02     The proposed project supports the Governments' objective to pro-
mote social, economic and administrative integration of all parts of the
country and in particular for the Shabwah Governorate, by providing im-
proved access to the towns of As Said, Ataq, the capital, Nisab and in the
long-run to the other cities in the Wadi Beihan. The proposed project
would also assist in strengthening the national road construction capabil-
ities.
C. Description
3.03     The project components are;
(a) the establishment of an independent construction unit (ICU),
assisted by management consultants and operating under the
supervision of the General Directorate for Corporations to
carry out road construction in the Shabwah Governorate;
(b) the construction of a two-lane paved road at minimum stan-
dards commensurate with the traffic and transportation needs
from Naqabah (on the Aden-Mukalla road) through Ataq, the
capital of the Governorate, to Nisab (92 km) with a branch
serving As Said (Map IBRD 13911);
(c) technical assistance to MOC for strengthening project
preparation and implementation capabilities and for
construction supervision of the Naqabah-Nisab road; and



-  5 -
(d) training in all aspects of operation of MOC and management
and operation of a road construction unit, including overseas
fellowships.
(a) Establishment of ICIJ
3.04     Since 1974 the Government has attempted to develop road construc-
tion capabilities by attracting foreign contractors througlh international
competitive bidding. These attempts have proven unsuccessful (para. 2.20)
and in each case the Government in agreement with the donor established an
ad hoc construction unit, carrying out the works either by force-account or
by unit rates. All of these construction units have work programs covering
the next several years, either continuing the original project or construc-
ting in the same area other economically justified roads under the current
development plan (para. 2.12). These units cover the western, southern,
eastern and northeastern parts of PDRY, but their mobility is hampered due
to the long distances and the limited paved network.
3.05     Based on experience with previous bidding for road construction,
the Government, after consultation with IDA and KFAED, the likely co-
financiers of the project, decided to include in the prequalification and
bidding process a ICU, for which a bid would be prepared by management con-
sultants in a manner similar to a bid prepared by a foreign contractor.
The tender documents spelled out in detail the conditions under which ICU
would participate in the bidding and bids were received in February 1980.
The ICU was the lowest bidder (para. 2.20). Because of the limited extent
of the works, about two-thirds - US$7.6 million equivalent - of the value
of the equipment needed for the construction will not be depreciated on the
construction of the Naqabah-Nisab road. This residual value is shown sepa-
rately in the cost table because it is an equity investment for ICU to be
used and depreciated on the continuation of the road to Wadi Beihan and
other road works in the Shabwah Governorate. ICU will be awarded the con-
tract, which after negotiations between the Government and ICU was reduced:
(i) to include only direct costs, exclusive of non-depreciated residual
values of equipment, and (ii) on the basis of reduced design standards
(para. 3.11). ICU would operate as an independent contractor under
expatriate management and be paid on the basis of unit rates in a manner
similar to any contractor, with its own cost accounting. The ICU was
legally constituted by ministerial resolution of March 24, 1981.
(b) Construction of Naqabah-Nisab Road
3.06     The 92 km project road sections comprises priority sections of the
road from Naqabah, at 335 km from Aden on the paved Aden-Mukalla road, to
Beihan, one of PDRY's four main agricultural areas. The existing road is a
non-engineered track, only driveable on a major part by four-wheel drive
vehicles. It has steep gradients, rocky surface, sandy sections, and sharp
curves, and is inadequate to serve traffic demand.
3.07     The proposed construction would consist of the Naqabah-Nisab
section of the road (71.9 km) with branches to As Said (16.3 km), Ataq (2.3
km), and a 1.5 kml link to Nisab.  The original design standards called for



- 16 -
a 6 m wide paved road with maximum gradient of 8%, minimum curves of 80 m
and bridges over wadis.  Because of the unacceptable high cost of building
the road to these standards the Government decided to increase the maximum
gradient to 12% and to accept minimum curves below 80 m to reduce overall
costs. Various other design changes were also made, including replacing
the bridges by irish crossings and changing alignments (para. 3.11).
(c) Technical Assistance
3.08     The technical assistance will help in strengthening MOC project
preparation capabilities, in supervising the existing construction units as
well as the establishment of ICU (para. 3.04). Its tasks will consist of
assisting the staff of MOC in reviewing investment, procurement and work
programs for the construction units, as well as providing recommendations
for improving management and operations of the various units and the
distribution of workload among them.  Furthermore, the samne team will also
assure construction supervision of the Naqabah-Nisab road in compliance
with the agreed specifications and construction standards. In this
respect, they will act through existing organizations of MOC, such as con-
struction and site survey, laboratory and contract supervision, as well as
carry out on-site supervision of the works. These consultants also would
assist MOC in project monitoring (para. 3.21). Terms of reference for the
above services (about 90 man-months) were agreed with the Government at
credit negotiations (Annex 1).
(d) Training
3.09     Training under the project would address both MOC and ICU staff.
First, MOC staff would be trained through overseas fellowships both
long-term (one year) and short-term (seminars) in highway engineering for
developing countries (total of about five manyears). Second, ICU staff
would receive on-site training and overseas fellowships. The on-the site
training would be done by specialized training instructors using the site
equipment and installations when available, without the less productive
effects of on-the-job training by the management experts. Training would
address the following fields: project management, construction planning
and management, workshop management, equipment maintenance, survey and road
design, equipment operation, cost accounting, and control. During
construction of the Naqabah-Nisab road candidates would also be selected
for overseas fellowships for periods of up to four to six months. These
fellowships, about 30 man months would take place in selected road
construction organizations and at training institutions. Details of this
training program, according to a proposal prepared by the management
consultants who prepared the ICU bid, were agreed with the Government at
credit negotiations.
D. Engineering
3.10     Technical studies for the Naqabah-Nisab-Beihan road were carried
out by consultants (Dorsch Consult, Germany) under the Second Highway
Project. Detailed engineering and bidding documents were completed in



- 17 -
Project. Detailed engineering and bidding documents were completed in
November 1978. Following bidding in February 1980, the management consul-
tants of the lowest evaluated bidder, ICU, revised the design standards in
agreement with the Government in order to achieve construction cost savings
by reducing design standards commensurate with safe operation of vehicles
in line with the economic and social needs of the area.
3.11     The main modifications which resulted in an overall cost saving of
about 35%, consisted of: (i) revising the design of river crossings; (ii)
reducing masonry retaining walls by redesigning the road alignment; (iii)
modifying slope Irotection works; (iv) limiting the number of culverts; (v)
reducing overall earthworks by increasing maximum gradients and following
the existing terrain level as much as possible; and (vi) reducing pavement
design. The reduced design satisfies the traffic needs. During construc-
tion further design changes will be sought on an ad hoc basis to limit
overall costs of the road construction and train the staff of the construc-
tion unit in designing and constructing low cost roads meeting economic and
social needs, with limited financial resources. Assurances were obtained
from the Government that any changes in standards and design during project
implementation would be discussed and agreed with IDA and other
co-financiers.
E. Cost Estimates
3.12     The costs in items (a) and (b) (para. 3.03) are based on actual
contract prices negotiated between the Government and the lowest evaluated
bidder, taking into account the proposed design changes (para. 3.11) and
the fee for the management consultants. The cost of technical assistance
is based on an average man-month rate of US$10,000, including social costs,
overheads, fees, overseas allowances and travel costs, consistent with cur-
rently applied rates in PDRY. The cost of training is based on a proposal
by the consultants selected by the Government to manage ICU and is accept-
able (para. 3.09). Cost estimates shown in Table 3.1, were updated at
credit negotiations on the basis of the contract between the Government and
ICU and an updated list of equipment needs for the establishment of ICU.
3.13     A 10% physical contingency is estimated on the quantity related
items for construction of the Naqabah-Nisab road and for consultant's
services. No physical contingencies are provided for the establishment of
ICU, since the amount provided for in the cost estimates relates to the
residual value of the equipment needed for the construction according to a
list of equipment described in the ICU bid. Contingency allowances for
price escalation are estimated overall at 12.5% (15.0% on foreign costs and
5% on local costs).  Price increases in local costs on the negotiated
construction contract are expected to be low, because most items likely to
increase substantially would be purchased early in the implementation
period and the price escalation formula which would apply to the contract
is based on documentary proof with the provision that only the exact value
of price increases would be paid to the contractor. This can be achieved
since ICU is a public contractor whose accounting is fully accessible to
the Government.

3.14     The total cost of the project is estimated at US$42.8 million
equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange component of US$33.5 million and
a local component of US$9.3 million.
F. Financing
3.15     The foreign exchange cost of the project would be covered by:  (i)
an IDA credit of US$12.5 million; (ii) a KFAED loan of KD 3.0 million
(US$10.5 million equivalent); and (iii) an OPEC Fund loan of US$10.5
million. The Government would provide the remainder of US$9.3 million
corresponding to the estimated local costs. Because of the shortage of
local resources (para. 1.06), the Government continues to seek an increase
in the KFAED loan to cover part of the local costs. The OPEC Fund loan
would parallel finance the equipment purchases for the establishment of ICU
and jointly part of the construction works. IDA and KFAED would jointly
finance the construction works, the technical assistance and training.
Since the equipment purchases for ICU are critical to the start-up of the
project the Government assured that the OPEC Fund loan would be effetive
before the IDA Credit. Furthermore although the KFAED loan is necessary
for the financing of the construction works, it is not critical in the
early stages of mobilization and the Government confirmed that it would
cover the expenditures, namely advance payments, over the period between
signing of the KFAED loan and effectiveness. As the successful implementa-
tion of the project is however dependent on securing all financing arrange-
ments the IDA credit effectiveness would be subject to effectiveness of the
OPEC Fund loan and signing of the KFAED loan.

G. Implementation
(a) Responsibility for Project Implementation
3.16     The expected timing for project implementation, which was
discussed and agreed with Government at credit negotiations, is shown in
Annex 2. MOC will have overall responsibility for project implementation
through its General Directorate for Corporations for the establishment of
ICU and performance of the construction contract and through the HA for
the supervision of the construction works. MOC will be assisted by two
sets of consultants. one, to help the General Directorate in the super-
vision of all construction units in general and ICU in particular and to
help the HA in the construction supervision of the project road; and two,
to manage the ICU. During credit negotiations assurances were obtained
from the Government that for the above consultants' services it will
retain firms and/or individual experts whose qualifications, experience
and terms and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to all
co-financiers.
(b) Execution
3.17     To implement the arrangements referred to in para. 3.12 the road
will be built by ICU on the basis of a unit rate contract under the res-
ponsibility of the General Directorate for Corporations and supervised by
the HA. The ICU established in March 1981 will be managed and operated
by qualified management consultants. It will have freedom to act as a
contractor in that it may: (a) hire expatriate and local staff at com-
petitive and incentive wage rates; and (b) import construction materials,
vehicles, equipment and spare parts as needed. During negotiations as-
surances were obtained from the Government that as a condition of credit
effectiveness it will enter into a contract with ICU on terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to IDA as well as the other co-financiers. A detailed
action plan was agreed with the Government for timely implementation of
the project (available in the project file).
(c) Procurement
3.18     The civil works were procured by International Competitive
Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Association's "Guidelines for
Procurement". The management consultants who prepared the bid for ICU,
the lowest evaluated bidder, were selected in consultation with IDA. The
same consultants are expected to be hired for the management of the con-
struction works. The works will be paid on the basis of unit rates pro-
posed in the bid and agreed during contract negotiations (para. 3.10).
The equipment for establishing ICU will be procured according to MOC pro-
curement regulations or in accordance with guidelines of the OPEC Fund.
The OPEC Fund is likely to request IDA to be the loan administrator.
(d) Financing
3.19     About US$400,000 equivalent of consultants' services will be
incurred prior to credit approval for project preparation, namely
contract preparation, design changes, preparation of tender documents for



- 21 -
equipment etc. These expenditures are recommended for retroactive
financing by the Association. The construction contract cost would be
financed jointly by the Government, the Association, the Kuwait Fund, and
the OPEC Fund, while the OPEC Fund would finance, the non-depreciated
value of the equipment for establishing ICU. The financing of the
establishment of ICU combined with advance payments for mobilization and
plant and an adequate working capital would ensure the cash flow for the
start-up of the project. During credit negotiations assurances were
obtained from the Government that it will secure through the Yemeni
National Bank, adequate working capital for ICU. On the basis of likely
costs and earnings of ICU, the Association and the Government agreed that
this working capital would be at least YD800,000 (US$2,320,000
equivalent).
H. Project Monitoring
3.20     It is expected that the construction of the Naqabah-Nisab road
may be the first step towards the construction of the road to Beihan, 160
km beyond Nisab. Furthermore, Yemeni nationals will gradually assume the
tasks, to be performed initially by the management consultants. It is,
therefore, desirable to closely monitor the progress and effects of this
project as a guide to possible improvements in the implementation of the
construction to Beihan. It will also be desirable to monitor during
construction, the effects of the road improvement on economic activity in
the zone of influence and in particular to report on changes in traffic
volumes and patterns, agriculture activity and outputs and other economic
activity. During credit negotiations agreement was reached with the
Government that it would provide the following data, as part of the
quarterly progress reports:
(a)  progress of road construction and supervision;
(b)  actual costs and unit costs of construction as compared
with estimates;
(c)  traffic volumes and patterns in the zone of influence of
the project road;
(d)  relevant data on economic activity, during project imple-
mentation and in particular a comparison before and after
the project; and
(e)  information on training results.
3.21     This data would be provided by the technical assistance consul-
tants to the MOC and terms of reference to this effect are in Annex 1.
The cost of monitoring would be met from funds allocated under the pro-
ject for technical assistance. In addition, IDA expects to collect data,
during project supervision with the assistance of MOC, on changes in
small scale industry, agriculture, health, rural electrification, educa-
tion and social services which may be due to the project.



- 22 -
I. Disbursements
3.22     Disbursements from the credit account would be made on the basis
of:
- 40% of the total construction cost of the Naqabah-Nisab road;
and
- 100% of the foreign exchange cost for consultants' services for
project preparation
- 50% of the foreign exchange costs for consultants' services for
technical assistance.
- 100% of foreign exchange cost for postgraduate training of MOC
staff
- 50% of foreign exchange cost for training of ICU staff.
Retroactive financing for an amount not exceeding US$400,000 equivalent
would be made for consultants' services to assist MOC in project prepara-
tion.
3.23      The following estimated disbursement schedule in accordance with
the implementation schedule (Annex 2) was discussed and confirmed with the
Government at credit negotiations.

IV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.01     The proposed project is primarily designed to improve a major
difficult access road, in poor condition, from the coastal region to the
Naqabah-Ataq-Nisab area and its hinterland in the Wadi Beihan. Its princi-
pal benefit, will be much better access for its population to the social,
administrative and developmental services and centers of the country. The
direct quantifiable benefits will be savings in road transport costs, which
alone are estimated to yield an economic return (ER) of 16%. In addition,
it is hoped that the road will increase the efficiency of agricultural
investments in the area and make it possible to exploit the comparative
advantages of the region for the production of fruit and vegetables. How-
ever, this additional benefit would constitute only a minor increase in the
total benefits, about 10% in 1990.
4.02     The central and northwestern parts of the Shabwah Governorate
between the Aden-Mukalla road and the YAR border, sustain a population of
approximately 100,000 inhabitants spread widely over an arid region of
semi-desert and treeless mountains some 200 km by 50 km. Many communities
are virtually cut off from neighboring areas and the rest of the country by
the high cost of transportation. Only trucks and four-wheel drive passen-
ger vehicles are able to operate over the existing tracks that link the
villages to the regional centers and to the Aden-Mukalla road.
4.03     The direct beneficiaries of the project will be:  (a) the owners
of vehicles, that is, private owner-operators and the government-owned
Public Corporation for Land Transport, trading and distribution companies,
and (b) the state farms, cooperatives and private farmers responsible for
marketing surpluses of the region's crops. As transport costs decline, the
Government's system-wide regulation of rates and fares will enable it to
lower rates and fares so that transport savings will be passed on to public
users of common carriers.
B. Highway Construction
(a) Economic Significance of Naqabah-Nisab-Beihan Area
4.04     The agricultural areas in and near the Naqabah-Nisab-Beihan region
add up to over 10,000 ha under regular cultivation, or 9% of the total
cultivable area of PDRY. The limited development of the area to date is
due largely to its inaccessibility, and lack of water and good soil.
Countrywide agricultural surveys in 1974 and 1975 concluded that the area
had potential for cultivating cash crops, including fresh fruit and
vegetables for the Aden market, provided that the transport obstacles could
be overcome. At present, the Government is aiming at improving existing
agriculture in the Naqabah-Nisab area as part of an Agricultural Support



- 24 -
Services Project, prepared with the assistance of FAO and financed by an
IFAD loan signed in November 1980. Under that project, improvement of
wells and water management practices, together with the application of fer-
tilizers and plant protection materials, are expected to raise the output
of well-irrigated areas fivefold and that of spate-irrigated areas by about
50%. Since the IFAD project is mainly directed to meeting the subsistence
requirements of the growing population, it is not critically dependent on
transport improvements. The total investment in this area is estimated at
about US$l million. A follow-up study of Wadi Beihan, 160 km beyond Nisab,
under bilateral assistance recommended that immediate agricultural develop-
ment focus on improving water management and farming techniques. Based on
these findings and an FAO/CP preparation report, IDA has appraised an Agri-
cultural Development Project in Wadi Beihan, proposed for presentation in
FY81.
4.05      Explorations are under way in several locations throughout the
area to assess the commercial feasibility of exploiting known mineral
deposits including copper, iron-ore, marble and rock salt. Test drillings
for oil are also going on northeast of Ataq and along the border with Saudi
Arabia. IDA is associated with this effort through the Petroleum Explora-
tion Promotion Project (Cr. 1050-YDR). Although none of these deposits are
at present being worked on a significant scale, some at least may be
developed during the coming decade, and their output would be transported
to Aden or Mukalla over the project road.
(b) Traffic
4.06     Traffic surveys were carried out by the feasibility study consul-
tants in 1977 and by the Ministry of Construction in 1980. Since 1977,
traffic on the tracks in the project corridor increased at an average rate
of 19% p.a. (13% p.a. for passenger vehicles and 33% p.a. for trucks).
These high growth rates were influenced by the increases in personal in-
comes from remittances of Yemenis working abroad, that boosted economic
activity in the influence area of the road and stimulated imports of con-
sumer and durable goods. After 1977, the traffic pattern in the corridor
also changed, when Ataq was once again designated governorate capital and
traffic shifted from one track to another as a result of worsening driving
conditions. The traffic projections are based on the 1980 surveys and
assume a declining importance of remittances, and a modest growth in
regional income sustained by the agricultural development programs des-
cribed above. Traffic volumes are shown in Table 4.1.

4.07      Upon opening of the new road, traffic will divert to it from the
direct Naqabah-As Said and As Said-Nisab tracks. At present, trucks gen-
erally carry less than full loads so that they can negotiate the steep
grades of the mountain pass near Naqabah and cross soft sand stretches with
limited bearing capacity. Increased loads are expected to reduce truck
traffic on the new road on average by 10%. The introduction of buses and
passenger cars to the area should be completed by 1990 and would allow the
same number of passengers to be carried by fewer vehicles and at lower
cost. The reduction in transport cost due to the new road, the more
efficient choice of vehicles and improved vehicle utilization will stimu-
late mobility of people and exchange of goods and services between the at
present largely isolated and self-sufficient communities. By 1990, this
generation effect is anticipated to increase normal freight traffic by 25%
and passenger traffic by about 60%.
4.08      The net impact of normal growth, fleet improvements and generation
will be to cause traffic to grow at an average of 7-8% per year over the
road's 20-year life.
(c) Road User Savings
4.09      Road user costs have been estimated by grouping traffic into six
categories, each represented by a typical vehicle. The economic cost per

km in ideal conditions (a flat, tangent, paved road) are shown below.
Details are in the project file. Passenger time costs refer only to work-
related trips; time savings on non-work related trips have not been quanti-
fied as benefits.

4.11     Total road user savings are summarized below.  Throughout the life of
the road, the main benefits will be savings in the transport costs of normal
traffic, accounting for more than two-thirds of all benefits quantified.

(d) Impact on Agriculture
4.12     The project road will increase the efficiency of agricultural
investments by assuring reliable access to fuel, fertilizers, extension
services, seasonal labor and other inputs. It will also, by providing more
reliable and faster delivery of harvested crops to markets, reduce spoilage
on the ground and in transport. Most of these benefits, if not all, are
quantified in terms of vehicle operating cost savings on existing and gene-
rated traffic. However, possible changes in the cropping pattern, toward
increased production of cash crops for export made possible by the improved
transport conditions on the new road, are not.
4.13     To determine the magnitude of these additional benefits, a sensi-
tivity analysis was made of the cropping pattern, assuming that at full
development 20% of the irrigated land could be devoted to production of
potatoes and other vegetables, compared with the 11% foreseen by FAO. This
would require that the IFAD project cover all existing lands in the
Naqabah-Nisab area, both cooperative and private, and would entail switch-
ing some 320 ha out of cereals. The resulting increase in value added,
about YD 220,000 per year, would be only a little over 10% of the road user
benefits in 1990. The relatively small benefits reflect the scarcity of
land presently available for cultivation in relation to the subsistence
needs of the population. However, these benefits could increase substan-
tially if on-going hydrological studies for the Nisab area confirm expecta-
tions about water availability and that a further expansion of the well-
irrigated area would be feasible. Because of the large degree of uncer-
tainty regarding the availability of additional water supplies only the
benefits based on the FAO study have been taken into account in determining
the economic return on the road investment.

(e) Civil Works and Maintenance Costs
4.14      In the calculation of the economic cost of the road, the total
cost of the construction equipment and fixed installations have been taken
into account, reduced by their residual value upon completion of the pro-
ject road. The estimated economic costs of road construction, maintenance
and pavement strengthening within the life of the road are as follows:
Table 4.5: Economic Construction Costs (in 1980 prices)
1.  Construction                                              YD Million

Residual value of equipment

Direct cost of construction
(labor, materials, fuel, etc.)                       7.95
Residual value of construction camp                   -0.97
Total                                           7.89
2.  Annual total routine maintenance                             0.03
3.  Resurfacing (1994)                                           0.52
4.  Residual value of road (2004)                               -2.13
(f) Results
4.15     Based on the above benefits and costs, the project's economic
return is 16%. The project is therefore justified economically. The pro-
posed alignments have been shown by the consultants to be the least cost
network improvement for linking the main population and production areas
around Nisab, Ataq and As Said, and with the existing paved road at
Naqabah. Economic returns for individual sections of the road have not
been calculated, as the accessibility objective could not be achieved by
building only parts of the road: benefits of individual sections if built
in isolation would be disproportionately lower than if built as part of the
scheme as a whole. Moreover, the proposed 92 km of road works represent a
viable construction quantum in relation to the construction capabilities to
be set-up. Any smaller size contract would necessarily entail higher con-
struction cost per km. Thus, with lower benefits and higher costs the eco-
nomic returns on individual sections would be unrealistically low and mis-
leading.
4.16     The investment in the Naqabah-Nisab road is well timed as it
represents the next logical step in the Government's strategy of intercon-
necting the country's isolated areas of economic activity. The Naqabah-
Beihan corridor is the last major area with a sizeable population segment



- 29 -
and with underdeveloped agricultural and other resources that has no ade-
quate access to the main road system. Accordingly, there is no other road
project with a higher priority in the current Five Year Development Plan.
4.17     The sensitivity of the project's economic justification has been
tested by assuming the benefits to turn out across the board 25% lower than
estimated, construction cost to be 20% higher and the construction period
one year (40%) longer. Even on these assumptions, the economic return
would still be 10%. The economic return of the project is more sensitive
to shortfalls in the estimated traffic and in user cost savings than to
increase in the construction costs. The project's net present value, at a
10% discount rate, would turn negative if base year traffic or unit user
cost savings were over 43% lower than estimated or if construction costs
were over 74% higher. However, these variations are well beyond what is
considered likely.
(g) Environmental Impact
4.18     The proposed road will improve the rural environment by providing
better access to markets, schools and administrative centers. The align-
ment chosen requires little if any expropriation of agricultural land or
displacement of dwellings.
C. Other Project Elements
4.19      It is not practicable to quantify the benefits of the "excess"
construction capacity that will be built up with technical and capital
assistance under the project but not used up in the construction of the
Naqabah-Nisab road. Nevertheless this investment is believed to be justi-
fied for the following reasons: (i) the experience of the past decade in-
dicates that, in the foreseeable future, PDRY will have to continue to rely
on its own resources to construct roads at a reasonable cost and that con--
struction capacity constraints will continue to hamper implementation of
worthwhile projects under the Development Plan; and (ii) in view of the
road improvement needs in PDRY and in Shabwah Governorate in particular, it
can be expected that the equipment and installations procured under the
project will be put to good use after completion of the Naqabah-Nisab road,
for example, improvement of the 160 km track from Nisab to Wadi Beihan will
at least in part be overdue by that time and this work alone would be more
than sufficient to consume the useful life left in these assets at the end
of this project.
D. Project Risk
4.20     The following events, if they took place could affect project
benefits:
(a) late project implementation caused by the delay in finaliz-
ing co-financing arrangements and/or mobilization of ICU;



- 30 -
(b)  slow construction of the project road caused by shortages and
low productivity of labor and plant and supply of materials;
and
(c)  early deterioration of the project road as a result of un-
forseeable floods.
Precautions have been taken, insofar as possible, to limit the project
risks, (i) cross effectiveness clauses and assistance by IDA for arranging
co-financing and mobilization of ICU, (ii) qualified management consul-
tants, and close monitoring of progress for project implementation, and
(iii) adequate road design and constant review of construction design to
minimize deterioration risks.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During credit negotiations agreement was reached with the
Government on various issues referred to in the report, including the
following matters of particular signifance:
(a)  the Government to take, in conformity with its regulations
all measures necessary to ensure at all times that the
dimensions and axle loads of vehicles using its roads do not
exceed limits consistent with the design standards of such
roads (para. 2.19);
(b)  MOC to employ qualified consultants for management of ICU,
technical assistance and training on terms and conditions all
satisfactory to the Association (para. 3.16), (Annex 1);
(c)  Government to seek approval from IDA and other co-financiers
for any changes in standards and design during project
implementation (para. 3.11);
(d)  MOC to monitor and report on project progress as outlined in
Annex 1 (para. 3.20); and
(e)  Government to secure working capital of at least YD800,000
for ICU through Yemeni National Bank (para. 3.19).
5.02     Conditions of effectiveness are:
(a)  effectiveness of the OPEC Fund loan agreement and signing of
the KFAED loan agreement for amounts of at least US$10.5
million equivalent each (para. 3.15); and
(b)  the MOC to enter into a unit rate contract with ICU on terms
and conditions satisfactory to all co-financiers (para. 3.17).
5.03     The project is suitable for an IDA credit of 10,300,000 Special
Drawing Rights (US$12,500,000 equivalent) to the Government of PDRY on the
usual terms.

ANNEX 1
PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
Terms of Reference
Technical Assistance for the Ministry of Construction
I. Introduction
1.       The Ministry of Construction (MOC) of the People's Democratic
Republic of Yemen wishes to obtain the services of consultants to assist:
(i) the MOC in the field of its road construction activities; (ii) the
Highway Authority (HA) in the construction supervision of the Naqabah-Nisab
road; and (iii) the MOC in monitoring and reporting on project
implementation.
2.       The services (about 90 manmonths) are expected to be required
during a period of about three years, and to be supplied by an advisory
team with extensive experience in project preparation, contract
administration, costing and financing, and construction supervision. The
services are expected to start late in 1981. The consultants will work as
an advisory unit, to the MOC for the separate aspects of their work. The
unit will comprise permanent staff and short term assignments.
3.       The Government of PDRY has applied for loans from the Interna-
tional Development Association and the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic
Development and it is intended that part of the proceeds of these loans
