MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONTAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTiVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE ALEXANDRIA WATER GENERAL AUTHORITY
OF THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR A SECOND ALEXANDRIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.     The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Alexandria Water General Authority (AWGA) in the Arab Republic of Egypt for
US$36.0 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard IBRD
variable interest rate. It would help finance a water supply rehabilitation
project in Alexandria. The project would be cofinanced by the German
Government for US$5.5 million equivalent, the Italian Government for US$22.5
million equivalent, and the National Investment Bank of Egypt (NIB) for
US$38.5 million equivalent.
2.     Background.  Alexandria's population was estimated to be 2.9 million
at the end of 1986 and is projected to reach 4.1 million by 2001. Past
population growth has occurred without parallel development of urban
services. Implementation of the Master Development Plan (through 2000) has
stagnated because of lack of resources and insufficient control over the
city's development. In recent years, increasing population density in certain
areas has created water demands in excess of the capacity of the distribution
network. Furthermore, frequent pipe repairs in some sectors of the
distribution system have been necessary because of excessive deterioration of
the system, much of which is over 80 years old. Unaccounted-for water for the
whole system has been estimated at about 502 of production while, in some
areas, investigations have revealed levels as high as 802. The financial
performance of AWGA has remained weak mainly because of the loss of revenues
associated with excessive unaccounted for water and insufficient water
tariffs. During the last several years, the Bank has emphasized the need to
improve AWGA's capital structure. The Government responded by providing
modest amounts of equity to help AWGA to service its debt with NIB, with the
result that AWGA's debt to equity ratio improved from 85:15 at the end of FY85
to 72:28 at the end of FY87.
3.     Rationale for Bank Involvement. Egypt's existing water supply infra-
structure is old, under-dimensioned and often under-maintained. System water
losses are excessive, and cost recovery low. The magnitude of required
investments and funding have been exacerbated by a fast increasing population
and rapid urbanization. Since December 1987, the Government's policies in the
water sector aim at greater efficiency in meeting demand through a number of
measures including realistic pricing of service. Its sector objectives are:
(i) to improve productivity and the quality of service through increased
capacity utilization and the introduction of preventive maintenance; (ii) to



- 2 -
encourage water conservation through appropriate pricing; and (iii) to
strengthen sector institutions. The Bank can assist the Government to pursue
these objectives by giving policy advice on technical, financial and
institutional aspects of sector operation and development while providing and
helping to secure much needed foreign currency funding for water system
expansion and rehabilitation. The first Alexandria Water Supply Project (Loan
1369-EGT), implemented with Bank assistance between 1977 and 1985 doubled
AWGA's production facilities but provided only limited upgrading of the
distribution system. The proposed project is de-facto the second phase of a
larger scheme intended to bring the level and quality of service up to
acceptable standards and to further develop the management ability of AWGA.
4.     Project Objectives.  The objectives of the Project are: (i) to improve
water distribution in AWGA's network by rehabilitating and upgrading the water
distribution system, optimizing system operation, and investigating and
correcting the causes of unaccounted for water; (ii) to improve AWGA's
operation, maintenance and metering practices through technical assistance and
manpower development; and (iii) to improve AWGA's capital structure and
financial performance through appropriate pricing policies and greater
operating efficiency.
5.     Project Description.  The Project consists of the following components:
(i) the rehabilitation of secondary water distribution pipelines and
replacement of associated house connections; (ii) the suppl)br and installation
of water main transmission pipelines and the construction,kf water storage
reservoirs and associated pumping stations; (iii) the provision of tools,
automotive equipment, consumer meters, flow and pressure recorders for main
transmission lines, spare parts, laboratory equipment, computers and other
materials to improve operations and reduce the level of unaccounted for water;
(iv) assistance of experts for construction supervision; (v) engineering
studies covering project planning and preparation, operation and maintenance,
and system planning and operation; and (vi) on-the-job training and training
seminars for AWGA's staff in areas of planning, operation maintenance, project
management, and construction supervision.
6.     The Project will be implemented over an eight-year period.  Its total
cost is estimated at US$102.5 million equivalent, including an estimated
US$12.5 million equivalent of duties on imported pipes and equipment. The
foreign exchange component amounts to US$64.0 million equivalent. The
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are given in Schedule A; the amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements and the schedule of disbursements
appear in Schedule B; and the timetable of key processing events and the
status of the Bank Group operations in Egypt are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map of the project area is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 7124-EGT dated August 24, 1988 is being distributed
separately.
7.     Agreed Actions. The main agreements reached are: (i) Government will
assist AWGA in the early project implementation period to service its debt,
both incurred and to be incurred, with NIB through budgetary transfers; (ii)
AWGA will generate revenues sufficient to cover its operating expenses other
than depreciation, working capital increases other than cash, and debt service



not financed by Government; (iii) AWGA will consult with the Bank before
undertaking new investments estimated to cost the equivalent of US$2.0 million
or more; (iv) the Government will make the necessary budgetary allocations to
clear up arrears for water services rendered by AWGA to Government agencies
and to the Western Desert; and (v) AWGA will implement a program of actions to
settle arrears, and complete the recording of its fixed assets and the
computerization of its accounts. During negotiations, the Government
confirmed that GTZ and the Italian Government would provide financial
assistance to AWGA in amounts of US$5.5 million and US$22.5 million
equivalent, respectively. Signing of agreements between AWGA and the two
cofinanciers would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed Loan.
8.    Justification. Substantial quantities of water will be saved as a
result of the proposed leak detection program, rehabilitation of the
distribution network, construction of reservoirs and other measures such as
improved maintenance and more realistic pricing. Such saving will benefit
domestic consumers, including an estimated 250,000 urban poor, as well as
commercial and industrial users whose activities h4ve been affected by
intermittent water service. It will also result in better utilization of
existing infrastructure and will permit the deferral of the expansion of some
of the water production facilities. The comprehensive technical assistance
and training program which is included in the Project will acquaint AWGA's
staff with modern public utility practices and will foster managerial
efficiency and contribute to AWGA's overall institutional development, while
other measures will improve AWGA's capital structure and financial
performance. The Project is the least-cost method of obtaining these
results. The internal rate of return is estimated at 127.
9.     Risks.  There is little risk that the major objectives of the Project
will not be met. First, the design and implementation of the infrastructure
components are not complex, and are expected to pose no difficulty. Second,
the technical assistance component is comprehensive and well prepared, and may
be expected to improve AWGA's overall operating efficiency. Third, the
Government financial assistance in the early stage of project implementation
and its new water tariff policy should enable AWGA to regain a more balanced
capital structure and attain a reasonable level of financial performance.
Finally, expert assistance in the supervision of project implementation,
regular Bank supervision, and close monitoring of AWGA's key performance
indicators will help to minimize project risks.
10.    Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors A$prove the proposed Loan.
