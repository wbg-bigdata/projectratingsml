INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECOINSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPNENT
REPORT AND REMOM1WENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF COSTA RICA FOR
AN EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Costa Rica for tha equivalent of $6.2 million to
help finance an education project. The loan would have a term of 30 years,
including a 10-year grace period with interest at 7-1/4 percent.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An updating economic report entitled "Memorandum on Recent
Economic Developments and Prospects of Costa Rica" was distributed to the
Bard on May 4, 1972. An economic mission which visited Costa Rica in
April 1973 is now preparing a report which will be distributed within the
next few rnonths. A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.   The long-
run developmnt performance of Costa Rica has been among the best in Latin
America, combining high average economic growth rates with a continuous
effort to distribute more broadly the benefits of development. During the
past decade, output expansion of over 6 percent per year in real terms,
coupled with some reduction in the population growth rate, resulted in an
increase in per capita GNP from $420 in 1960 to over $560 in 1971. Also,
in spite of a labor force growing at over 3 percent per annum, open unem-
ployment was kept at a low 4-5 percent of the ecoromically active popula-
tion. The absence of a standing arty and minimal defense expenditures
permitted the public sector to channel a large share of resources to the
economic and social sectors. Today almost nine-tenths of the population
is literate and the mortality rate is one of the lowest in the Hemisphere.
However, the vagaries associated with heavy dependence on a few export items
as a source of income and growth, together with periods of overly expansionary
fiscal and monetary policies, have led to periodic financial difficulties.
At present Costa Rica is going through such a period of serious tiscal and
balance of payments stringency.
3.        The economic evolution of Costa Rica during the past few years
provides a vivid illustration of short-term cyclical fluctuations. Between
1967 and 1969 exports expanded rapidly (mainly banana and manufactured goods)
and the fiscal situation improved considerably. Public savings rose from
0.7 percent of GDP in 1968 to 3.5 percent in 1970. Net international reserves
rose from minus $14 million in 1966 to $38 million at the end of 1969.
However the situation began to deteriorate during 1970. The rate of growih
of real GDP dropped to less than 5.5 percent in 1970-71, yet aggregate
monetary demand was allowed to increase more rapidly than during the pre-
cedingB years.  As a result, in 1970 merchandise imports increased by almose
30 nercent, outDacing the growth in exports by 8 percentage noints.
Much the same monetary policies were followed during 1971, at a time when
coffee prices were falling and export earnings stagnated. The introduction
of a dual exchange rate and of surcharges on non-essential imports were not



- 2 -
sufficient to redress the situation, because credit continued to expand too
rapidly.
4.        There has undoubtedly been some improvement in the financial situa-
tion during 1972. The resource gap, which had risen from 7 percent of GDP in
1970 to 9.4 percent in 1971, narrowed to 6.7 percent in 1972. In October
a substantial part of imports were shifted from the "official" to the "free"
foreign exchange markets; this was equivalent to an average devaluation of
8 percent. A major tax reform was approved by Congress during the year.
Unfortunately, as imports slowed down, as the share of duty-free imports
from other Central American Common Market (CACM) countries increased and as
the economy continued to grow slowly, the revenue gains from the tax reform
were offset by losses in revenue from import taxes, These difficulties did
not deter the Government, however, from intensifying its development effort.
Public investment, in fact, rose during this periodl. This effort was backed
by a substantial increase in the savings of the decentralized agencies. On
the other hand, the Central Government's finances, weakened by the sluggish
growth of the economy, worsened and so the overall savings performance of
the public sector deteriorated. The dual exchange rate introduced the year
before began to bear fruit during 1972. The trade deficit decreased reflect-
ing both a better export performance and a drastic fall in the growth rate
of imports. Progress was also made in containing credit expansion to the
private sector.  However, the Government was unable to reduce import payment
arrears, now estimated at $50 to $60 million. In sum, the Government has
made substantial efforts to redress the economic situation since 1971, but
has been unable to solve the fiscal problem.
5.        Recent coffee price increases, the continued rise in sugar and beef
exports and a progressive normalization of CACM relations will improve Costa
Rica's overall export prospects and consequently improve output growth during
the next two years. The main problems and policy concerns are expected to be
the restoration of internal financial stability and., because Costa Rica is an
open economy, the "spill-over" effects of excess domestic demand upon the bal-
ance of payments. Although the Government is making efforts to strictly con-
trol expenditure growth, and the 1973 budget will benefit from the full (12-
month) impact of the tax measures introduced in March 1972, the fiscal deficit
will require substantial banking system financing. The Costa Rican authorities
plan to compensate the inflationary impact of this financing by rapidly reduc-
ing import payment arrears, which will reduce liquidity, and by restricting
credit to the private sector so as to insure that total credit expansion is
not more than 10 percent, in line with current output growth. However, because
of the elections in early 1974, a fully adequate set of stabilization measures
cannot be expected in 1973. There is a general recognition of the necessity
to take such action after the elections. This will have to include another
package of tax measures as part of a direct attack upon the fiscal problem.
Given the encouraging outlook for 1973, the postponement of a broader stabili-
zation effort until early 1974 is not expected to lead to more serious
difficulties.
6.        The Bank has kept up a dialogue with the Costa Rican authorities
about the fiscal and other policies which are necessary for the orderly exploi-
tation of the country's substantial development potential. Important steps
ha- : been taken in the last year - including the tax and exchange rate measures
and the monetary program noted above - but further efforts are necessary.



-3-
For the longer run, Costa Rica has the potential for rapid economic growth.
Substantial progress has been made, with public support, in reducing the
rate of population increase. Considerable potential exists in agriculture
and mining, while manufacturing could continue to expand rapidly if the
Central American Common Market can be successfully restructured. In order
to make good this potential, a high level of public investment will be
required but will only be feasible if sufficient public savings can be
generated. The Bank's last econmic report estimated that, if the same
overall growth rates as the 1960's were to be achieved in the present
decade, gross public external capital inflows of $320 million would be
required in 1971-76. This should be attainable without any major increase
in the level of external public debt service, which presently absorbs
about 10 percent of export earnings, so long as Costa Rica can continue to
rely on official aid for the bulk of its long-term official capital require-
ments and can minimize medium-term borrowing from conmsrcial sources.
Present fina=oial difficulties and Governmentts efforts to impnwant correc -
tive measures justify foreign financing of a share of local costs for high
priority projects.c
7.      Apart from the Bank, external financing is provided principally
by USAID, the Inter-American DeveTopment Bank(IDB)-and the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration(CABEI). USAID has been active
mainly in agriculture, road maintenance and construction and health.
IDB has been financing mainly agricultural and industrial credit, water
supply, housing, feeder roads, rural electrification and vocational
and agricultural education. CABEI is active in financing projects
which have a regional impact, principally in transport, industry and
telecommunications.  The past lending of these agencies is 3s'xanarized

PART II - BA2NK GROUP OPEBRTIONS IN COSTA RICA
3        0Costa Rica has to date received fifteen Bank loans totalling
$119.3 million and one IDA credit for $4.6 million. As of March 31,
1973, the Bank and IDA held $96.9 million, inclwding $40.0 million not
yet disbursed. The latest operation, a loar. for a highway studies
project, was signed in December'1972.
9,ecution of Bank Group-financed proiects has, on the whole,
been satisfactory, although there have been delays in implementing an
ongoing power loan, and cost overruns have occu:rred on projects in
power and highways.  Annex II contains a surrriar a tatement of Bank Group
operations as of March 31, 1973, as well as notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.
E.     T In the past Bank and IDA lending to Costa Rica hnas been fairly
diversified, including operations in agriculture, industry, highways,
power and telecommunicatiions. Our future lending strategy which
colrolements that of other international development agencies, con-
centrates on (i} diversification of noroduction and exports (projects)
in agriculture, miiing and industry)" (ii) improvement of efficiency
and savings performance of public sector agencies through institutional
and policy reformis (power, telecommunications and educaticn); and
(iii) support for programs aimed at proviLding high priority physical and
social infrastr-acture (power, telecoiinmunications, transportation and
education). The next o-perations in Costa Ri.ca are expected to be in the
power and telecommunication sectors.  In the area of technical assistance
the Baznk is currently acting as executive agency for a NTDP-financed project
to stu:dy the transport needs of the heavily congested Sarn Jose Metropolitan
Area, from which project proposals are expected. The Bank is also giving
financial assistance to the first stage of an unemployment survey i-n Costa
Rica being implemented by the National University.
11. *    FC has made o-ne investment in the fonn of a loan of $0.6 million
in Costa Rica to Productos de Concreto S.A., a compan which manufactures
concrete products. The loan has been fully repaid.
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
12,      Costa Rica has traditionally devoted a large share of its
resources to education, with the result that in quantitative terms the
country now has ane of the best education systems in Iatln AmPrica.
As of 1971, 84 percent of the relevant age group vas enrolled in primary
schools and 89 percent of the population was classified as literate.
Student-teacher ratios are relatively low, and a high proportion of
teachers at both the primary and secondary levels are qualified for their
jobs. However, these achievements have been realized in the absence of
any coordinated plan for educational development, and consequently, the
syst&in has evolved in a somewhat haphazard way.



National Plan for Bducational Development
13.     The National Plan for Educational Development (1972-1980), the
culmination of an intensive study of the achievements and shortcomings
of education in Costa Rica through 1970, is designed to reverse this
process and to improve the efficiency of the educational system, while
relating it more closely to the socio-economic needs of the country.
The Plan identifies as major deliciencies: (i) a highly centralized
administrative structure; (ii) the imbalances of educational opportunities
between urban and rural areas; (iii) high dropout and repetition ratios;
and (iv) excessive emphasis on academic v. vocational programs within
the formal education system at the secondary level. Although a number
of the details have yet to be determined, the Plan provides a good
framework within which to resolve many of these problems over the next
decade or so.
Structure of Education
14.     Prior to 1972, the structure of formal education included
six years of primary school, followed by three years of lower secondary
school and two (academic) or three (vocational) years of upper secondary
school. In accordance with the Plan, the school system now comprises
four levels: one or two years of pre-primary school, three cycles of
three years each of basic education, three years of diversified upper
secondary education with several specialized options, and two to seven
years of higher education. New curricula and teachers' manuals
are under preparation, and new criteria for the evaluation of students'
programs and for student guidance have been developed and issued. In-service
training courses for teachers, specialist staff and administrators have
already started.
15.     Responsibility for all primary and secondary education is vested
in the Ministry of Public Education.  Private schools, accounting for 6
and 13 percent, respectively, of primary and secondary enrollments, are
supervised by the Ministry and are required to use the same curricula
as public schools. Non-formal education and training is offered by the
Ministries of Education, Agriculture, Health, Labor and Culture, Youth
and Sports, as well as by the National Institute of Apprenticeship (INA).
All post-secondary educational institutions, including the University
of Costa Rica, the Santa Clara Technical Agricultural School, the
Institute of Technology at Cartago and the National (Teacher Training)
University are autonomous.
Administration
16.     Educational policy is set by the Higher Council of Education,
chaired by the Minister of Education. Prior to the new National Plan
for Educational Development, educational administration was highly
centralized at the Ministerial level, with fourteen Regional Directorates
exercising purely administrative functions. As a consequence of the
Plan, the Ministry is being reorganized, chiefly to rationalize technical
and administrative functions and to strengthen planning, and considerable
responsibility is being decentralized to the regional level. To foster
community interest and participation in the educational process, a



-6-
Community Council has been established in each region, comprising
representatives of district education councils and parents' associations.
Finally, to ensure coordination among the Ministry of Education, the
other Ministries offering non-formal education and training programs
and the higher education institutions, the Plan calls for a Coordinating
Committee to determine the respective functions of each with regard to
manpower needs and training programs.
Primary Education
17.     Primary education, starting at age six or seven, is provided
free in public schools and is compulsory.  On the positive side, about
84 percent of the relevant age group is enrolled at this level. However,
fewer than one-third of the students complete primary education without
repetition, and drop-out rates, particularly in the first few grades,
are high. The Plan calls for qualitative improvements in primary educa-
tion, including mora eni4hasis on exploratory learning techniques and on
mathernaticsD science and practical subjects.  The Government has already
initiated an in-service teacher training program to familiarize teachers
with the new orientation and subject-matter. Together with pro-service
training programs, this effort should make it possible to eliminate all
unqualified primary school teachers (presently 14 percent of those teach-
ing) by 1980 and to provide a surplus of primary teachers who, with some
upgrading, could be qualified to teach at the lower secondary level.
Secondary Education
18,     Public secondary education is free, but not compulsory. About 50
percent of all primary school graduates enter secondary school. and about
nalf of these complete the course; some 26 percent of the relevant age
group is presently enrolled at the secondary level. Geographic imbalances
in educatinal- opportunities are considerable:  the probability o entranc e
to secondary school is more than 90 percent in urban areas aand less thaIr.
20 nercent in the countryside.
19.     The Plan recommends both qualitative and quanttitative  i-pi.mrNi'suents
in secondary education.  Lower secondary education (grades 7-9) oecomes
the third cycle of basic education, compulsory for all s   _nt%
e'mr,}lasizing practical and pre-vocationml subVLects and T' *--id.Lng
better guidance for students who must tenninate Pfll b- ne education at
h--Ws level.  At the upper seconldary level (grades 10-1 2), new options in
Y. 1 ..l cca.nuiications and art are being added to the existing academic,
agric- ,lturalv indstrial and  Imercial prog rar:s.  Total enroll nt is
,a e ed. tc, rec1ich 53 percent of the relevarnt age group, although about
4? pe-cunt is probably a more realistic figure. Intensive teacher training
and upgrading programs have been designed to supply the teachers needed
for such art expansion.
Higher Education
20.     Of the 15,700 students enrolled at the University of Costa Rica (UCR),



- 7-
only 15 percent were enrolled in the sciance and technical faculties in
1971, the balance studying humanities, social sciences and education.
In addition, about 2,430 students were enrolled in primary and secondary
teacher-training institutions outside the University and about 60 in the
new Santa Clara Technical Agricultural School established in 1970. An
Institute of Technology at Cartago, established in 1971, and the National
(Teacher Training) University, established in 1973, have not yet begun to
function. The UCR is planning to develop regional centers, which are now
being prepared with assistance from the Inter-American Development Bank.
In order to coordinate the davelopment of teacher training, all normal
schools will be integrated into the new National (Teacher Training)
University. During the next two years, the University will be planned,
organized and administered by an ad hoc connission comprising the
Ministers of Education, Planning and Labor, and eight professors of
the UCRO  The Government has not yet decided whether to seek external
technical assistance in this endeavor.
Technical Education
21.       Middle level technician training does not exist in Costa Rica.
However, the Institute of Technology at Cartago, established in 1971, will
begirn operating in 1973 and will produce its first graduates in 1975.
Present plans are to offer programs in construction, electronic, electro-
mechanical and forestry technology. The Inter-American Development Bank has
been approached for assistance in the development of this institution. The
education of professional engineers is the responsibility of the Faculty of
Engineering of the UCR, which offers courses in civil, electrical, mechanical,
chemical and industrial ergineering. Agricultural education at the post-
secondary technician level is offered at the Technical Agricultural School,
created by law in 1970 to train technicians for management and extension
work. The School's physical facilities are excellent, with financial and
technical assistance being provided by USATD. The Ministry of Agriculture
and the UCR are also providing effective support for the School. A second
similar institution which would specialize in animal husbandry is in the
planning stage. At the University level, the Faculty of Agriculture of
the UCR graduates about 15 students per year; this is inadequate to meet
present and projected demand and the Faculty is receiving financial and
technical assistance from the Inter-American Bank and USAID to expand its
program.
Non-Formal Education and Training
22.       The main agencies concerned with non-formal education are the
Ministry of Education, which provides non-technical adult evening classes,
and the National Institute of Apprenticeship (INA). In 1971 they enrolled
7,300 and 6,700 students, respectively. Extension programs in agriculture,
health and nutrition are offered by the Ministries of Agriculture, Health,
Labor and Social Welfare, and Culture, Youth and Sports.



-8-
23.       Training for specific occupations is the responsibility of INA,
established in 1965. The Institute operates as an autonomous body
within the Ministry of Labor, and is financed by a payroll tax on
industrial and comrercial enterprises. It enrolls out-of-school
youths and adults in seven different types of courses, inluding three-
year apprenticeship courses, short courses to improve the skills of
employed workers, foreman training, basic education for early school
leavers and extension courses for women to improve home skills. lNA's
achievements are impressive and its relations with industry are good.
To date, more than 10,OOO people have benefited f'rom its courses.
Educational Finance
24).      Public education and training from pre-primary through upper
secondary school is almost completely financed by the Central Government,
although local authorities help by providing sites and labor for school
construction. Current expenditures are defrayed by the ministry of
Education while expenditures for maintenance and invesitment are made
iainly by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport. The budgets of
higher educatiorn institutions are independent of the Ministry of Eduzation,
with the TJCR entitled by law to secure annually the equli:valent of at least
10 percent of the budget of the Ministry. Private education is negligib'Le,
both in terms of enrollmsnts and expenditures, and virtually no private
schools receive financial aid from the Goverment.
25.       Cornsiderable expansion in the education system during the past
few decades has created a heavy financial burden on the Government.   In
1971, public expenditure on education absorbed 5.2 percent of GDP,
againsti 4.7 percent in 1967, and 28 percent of total Government expendi-
tures. These figures are somewhat high by Latin Amer-can standards. On
the othir hand, Costa Rican authorities maintain that the fact that the
Government does not keep a standing arnry has enabled it to channel moze
resources oroportionately than many other countries into the social sec-
tors and in particular to education.
26.       Given the already large share of resources devoted to education,
government authorities are faced with the difficullt problem of expanding
educational opportunities, particularly at the secondary level and in
rural areas, and improving the quality of education, while not significantly
increasirg expenditures.  Hence  the Plants great emphasis on efficiency.
The Ministry of Education, in cooperation with the Ministry of Public
l4orks and Transport, is making a major effort to determine ways in which
the normal growth in expenditures can be directed in greater proportions
into capital expenditures in order to provide the additional physical
facilities needed to implement the new curricula at all levels of education,
as well as to design programs -which will have significant impact on
quality widthout greatly increasing recurrent expenditures.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.     Preparation of the proposed project dates back to October
1971 when, at the request of the Government, a UNESCO mission
visited Costa Rica to conduct an education sector survey and to
identify project items suitable for Bank financing. The mission's
report, which was completed in January 1972, served as a basis
for discussions between the Bank and the Government regarding the
appropriate strategy for future expansion and improvement of the
education system. In April 1972 a second UNESCO mission visited
Costa Rica to assist the Government in completing preparation of
the loan request. The project was appraised in the field during
September/October 1972 and nrgotiations for the proposed loan
wart held in Washington in May 1973.    A report entitled
"Appraisal of a First Education Pro;ect in Costa Rica" (No. CR-
dated June   , 1973) is being distributed separately.  The main
features of the loan and project are summarized in Annex III.
Project Description
28.       The proposed project is intended to assist Costa Rica in
implementing its National Plan for Educational Development in the areas
of lower secondary and non-formal vocational education. The project
includes the construction and equipment of (i) four new and two extensions
of rural lower secondary schools; (ii) workshop and laboratory facilities
for twenty-five existing secondary schools; and (iii) five new vocational
training centers. It also includes related technical assistance and
training. The project would be carried out during 1973-77.
29.      The construction of the rural lower secondary schools would
have a two-fold objective of helping to redress imbalances in educa-
tional opportunities throughout the country and, through the
non-formal community activities which would take place at the schools,
of promoting rural development in the areas served. In 1971 the
Government initiated a special program to provide secondary schools
in rural areas where there are large numbers of primary school
graduates. An important criterion in the selection of areas has
been the community's interest in having a school, as demonstrated
by its willingness to provide assistance in any of various ways,
such as part-time labor for construction or maintenance, building
materials or temporary shelter for teachers and school officials.
In all cases the community must provide the land for the school. At
the time of appriAisal of the proposed project eleven such schools
had been approved by the Ministry of Education. The proposed loan
would help to finance new facilities for four of them (in Jicaral,
Hojancha, Pacayas and Santa Maria), which are currently operating
in temporary facilities provided by their communities, and additional
facilities for two (in Aguas Zarcas and Buenos Aires), which already
have some new classrooms under construction with community support.
The curricula of the rural schools would be similar to those of other



- 10 -
lower secondary institutions, however, eivn that agriculture is the main
economic activity of the areas served and that, at least in the medium-run,
a relativeV high proportion of students will go directlv on to work, they
will include a strong pro-vocational component in agriculture and how
science.    The curricula would be subject to continuous review to take
account of changing cfrcuDtances in respect of employment prospects and
opportunities for higher education.
30.       In accordance with the reconmxndation of the National Plan for
Educational Development, the Ministry of Education has decided to give rxore
emphasis to the sciences, industrial arts and home science  at the lower
secondary level to help students to develop basic skills in chese areas.
However, most lower secondary schools lack the physical facilities needed
to teach such subjects in a meaningful way. The Ministry has accordingly
decided that in future new secondary schools to be constructed will be pro-
vided with the neceasary facilities. The proposed loan is designed to meet
the needs of already existing schools by helping to finance the constructior.,
furniture and equipnent for industrial arts and homi science workshops and
science laboratories at twenty-five estabUshed lover secondary schools5
sufficient to service 36,000 students or about 60 parcent of present enroll-
ments at that level. During negotiations it was agreed that the Ministry of
Education would organize an in-service training program to prepare teachers
in the sciences and practical subjects to use these facilities.
31.       To expand and regionalise vocational trL  r facilities, now
concentrated ia the capital of San Jose; tie proposed loan would help to
finance the construction, furniture and equipment for a new headquarters and
four maw regional centers for the National Institute of Apprenticeship (INA).
The regional centers would be located in rapidly growing areas (Naranjo,
Limon, Uberia and San Isidro), each with a population of from 90,000 to
200,000. The four cenrters would have the capacity to enroll a total of about,
3,200 students at any one time, providing some 10,000 traind wo&ers per
year. Given the structure of employmnt in the areas to be served, much o:
th.e training would initiaJly be for agriculture-related occupationa, Pr. -
grc" would be continually revised over tim  to moet changing nmnower rv-
quire.wnts. During negotiations, it was agreed that 9.n adzAaiory br is.y of
em.poyers, employees and Governmnt officials would be establt i.w-sb  ;t each
center to ensure that the training provided Wy INA is appr2a---riata t the
zrarl    needs of the respective regions. The new headow.. .era for INA would
be con8tructad in San Jose and, in adeation to housin^ kAhe IMTA administration,
,yould include classrooam  and workhopE? with a total :apacity of 770 student
?'aces for conrce    ed service courvsei. Some 1 ,50 trainees could be
erz,,lled at any one tim, provrling some 4,,500 trained workers per year.
ZL3a 9aresent headquarters at, La Uraca, near San Jose, would be mintained
arv! operated as a. pl.2.ot centr for all ew training programs.
32.       The project inoltides, six man-years of  cialists' services and
twenty-four man-years of fellowships for local staf.;roero         sves
would be provided to:  (i) iimove existing agriculture and home economics
courses in lower secondary schools; (ii) improve teaChing methods for



- 11 -
agriculture and home science subjects in teacher training institutions;
and (iii) advise on agricultural training at the INA vocational centers.
Fellowships would be provided for:  (i) school principals to be trained
in new methods of rural school organization and management; and (ii) agri-
culture and home science teachers to be trained in their respective fields.
Cost and Financing
33.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $9.38 million.
Construction costs represent 56 percent of the total; furniture and equipment
20 percent; technical assistance 3 percent; project administration 2 percent;
and physical and price contingencies 19 percent. The proposed $6.2 million
loan would finance 66 percent of total project costs ($4.7 million of foreign
exchange and $1.5 million of local costs). Given the budgetary constraints
described in Part I above, the Government's capacity to execute and finance the
construction of facilities and recurrent expenditures related to the project
has been carefully evaluated and found to be adequate to carry out the project
with the support of the proposed loan. Of the $3.2 million equivalent of
financing from domestic resources, $0.8 million would be provided by INA and
$2.4 million by the Central Government. INA will repay the Government from
its own resources, (based on a payroll tax on industrial and commercial
enterprises) for an estimated $2 million provided out of the proposed
loan for the construction of the vocational centers on the same terms
and conditions as those of the Bank loan. During negotiations it was agreed
that the execution of a contract between INA and the Government to this effect,
satisfactory to the Bank, would be a condition of disbursement of loan funds
for the vocational centers. With regard to recurrent expenditures INA will
cover the costs of the vocational training centers, and the workshops and
laboratories will not require new teachers but only additional expenditures
for materials and maintenance. The rural schools will require some teachers
in addition to those already employed, but the Government considers this
expenditure to be fully justified in view of the expected imDact of the
schools on rural development.
Project Entity
34.       Responsibility for project implementation would be vested in a
project unit, to be established in the Ministry of Public Works and Transport.
The unit would have a full-time staff, including a Director, who would report
to the Minister, an Architect and a Procurement Officer. In addition, an
Educator would be seconded from the Ministry of Education to the project unit.
The project unit would coordinate activities within the Government and with
INA, and provide liaison with the Bank. It has been agreed that establishment
of the project unit and appointment of the Director would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan, and that the Architect, Educator and
Procurement Officer would be appointed within six months of loan signing.
Procurement and Disbursement
35.       For furniture and equipment, the loan would be disbursed against
100 percent of foreign expenditures and 90 percent of local expenditures; the



- 1 2 -
latter percentage represents the estitmated CIF cost of locally procured
inported goods or the ex-factory cost of domestically manufactured goods pur-
chased from. local dealers. Disbursements would a:Lso be made against 55
percent of total expenditures for civil works, including related professionla
services; 100 percent of foreign expenditures on specialists' services; 100
percent of the cost of fellowships; and 65 percent of project unit staff costs
(95 percent of expenditures made until December 31, 1974 and 55 percent from
January 1, 1975 to the closing date). All contracts for civil works, furniture
and equipment would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding and contracting for services would follow normal Bank Group procedures.
At the request of the Government and in accordance with the Central American
Agreement on Fiscal Incentives for Industrial Development, manufacturers in
Central American Connon Market countries would receive a margin of preference
of 50 percent of the applicable external tariff or 15 percent of the c.i.f.
nrice, whichever is lower. The disbursement schedule for the proposed loan
is indicated in Annex III.
PART V  - LEGAT. INSThUMNTS AND AUTI{ORITY
36.     The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of
Costa RILca, the report of the Committee provided for in Article III
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreetent and the text of a Resolu-
tion approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.  The draft Loan Agreement conforns to the normal
pattern of loans for education projects.
37.      1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the 3ank.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION.
Loan No.
631      Third Power Project; US$12.0 Million Loan of July 10, 1969;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1973.
Project execution is about 24 rmnths behind schedule and costs
have increased some 60 percent above appraisal estimates, due
primarily to tunnelling difficulties and to initial lack of
organization and experience. Even with the present overruns the
project compares favorably with a thermal power plant of similar
capacity up to discount rates of 16.5 percent. The project is
under close supervision. The Borrower has arranged to finance
the overrun with loans from foreign commercial banks.
632      Second Telecommunications Project   US$6.5 Million Loan of
Project execution has been satisfactory and tne loan is expected
to be fully disbursed by the Closing Date.
664      Siquirres-Limon Highway Project"  US$15I? Million Loan of April 2,
Physica1 progress on the project has been good, with about :50
percent oF work completed. However, a bid overrun of abcout 30
piercent above the appraisal estimate for construction (excludirq
contingencies) has reduced the rate of return from 17 to 14
percent.

ment would be subject to international competitive
bidding, and contracting for services would follow
normal Bank Group procedures. All items will be
grouped to the extent practicable to encourage com-
petition. The local construction industry seems
capable of meeting the needs of the project; for-
eign bidding is expected for furniture and equipment.
Suppliers in the Central American Common Market coun-
tries would receive a margin of preference in bid
evaluation of 50 percent of the applicable external
tariff or 15 percent of the c.i.f. price, whichever
is the lower.
