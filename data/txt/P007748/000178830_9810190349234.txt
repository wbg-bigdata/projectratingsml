APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN NICARAGUA
SUMMARY
i.        The Government of Nicaragua has requested Bank assistance in
financing an education project, which was appraised by a mission in Novem-
ber and December, 1966 and in August, 1967.
ii.       The proposed project, as modified during appraisal, would consist
of (a) the construction and equipment of two teacher training schools and
the extension of a third, (b) the construction and equipment of nine secon-
dary schools, (c) extensions to and equipment of seven secondary schools,
and (d) the equipment of two secondary schools.
iii.      The proposed project would provide 11,540 new places in these
21 schools; 3,440 to replace those in existing, unsuitable facilities and
8,100 additional places, raising enrollment from 10,500 to 18,600 pupils.
These figures form part of the expected increase in the total secondary
school system from 27,000 pupils in 1966 to 42,000 pupils in 1972, which
would raise the percentage of the age group 13-17 enrolled in secondary
schools from 15% to 18%.
iv.       In the 18 general secondary schools emphasis would be laid on
the teaching of sciences and most of the schools would have commercial
streams. The project would bring about improvements in administration
and supervision, curricula, weekly work load, length of school year and
standards of teaching.
v.        The construction or extension of three teacher training schools
would permit reorganization of the training of primary school teachers
and a concentration in four (instead of 14) schools of which three would
be project schools. The total output of teachers is expected to rise from
616 in 1966 to 800 in 1973, of which 595 would come from the project
schools. This increase is necessitated by the anticipated expansion of
primary education and the need to replace the large number of unqualified
teachers.
vi.       The educational attainment of the economically active population
is low and, to improve productivity levels, greatly increased numbers of
workers with completed secondary and with higher education are needed.
More general secondary schools would contribute to meeting the need for
medium-level personnel and support the expansion of the universities and
other post-secondary institutions.
vii.      An adequate supply of qualified entrants to the teacher training
institutions and the secondary schools in the proposed project is assured.
No problems in regard to opportunities for employment for graduates are
expected.
viii.     Sufficient teachers for the proposed schools are assured by the
output of the Schools of Education of the Universities.



- ii -
ix.       The annual budget of the Ministry of Edacation can be expected
to increase from C$88 million in 1966 to C$221 million in 1972, including
C$19 million as a result of the project. It is not expected that the
Government will encounter difficulties in meeting the capital cost not
financed by the Bank as well as the recurrent costs of the project.
x.        School design would be austere and consistent with functional
needs. Estimated costs of construction, furniture and equipment are rea-
sonable. Procurement would be by international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines Relating to Procurement."
xi.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $8.0 million, of
which 3.5% is for site development, 70% for construction (63% for academic
buildings and 7% for dormitories and staff housing), 22.5% for furniture
and equipment and 4% for professional fees. The foreign exchange component
is estimated at $2.7 million, or 33% of the total cost.
xii.      A project unit with a full-time project director and supporting
staff would be necessary for implementation. The employment of private
architects would also be required.
xiii.     The project would provide a suitable basis for a loan of $4
million for a period of 25 years including a grace period of ten years
subject to the provisions of paragraphs 5.09 and 5.10.



APPRAISAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN NICARAGUA
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A Unesco project identification mission visited Nicaragua in
June-July 1965 and, on the basis of the priority needs for education iden-
tified in its report, a Unesco project preparation mission assisted the
Government of Nicaragua to prepare an education project in July 1966. This
project was presented to the Bank, with a request for financial assistance,
in August 1966. A Bank appraisal mission, composed of Messrs. C. P. van
Dijk, C. Germanacos, M. Ramirez, R. Eyles (consultant) and K. Thint (consul-
tant) visited Nicaragua during November-December 1966. After the new
government took office Mr. van Dijk again visited Nicaragua in August 1967
to reach aareement with it on the project and to update the technical in-
formation.
1.02      The project, as submitted to the Bank, consisted of the expansion
and improvement of secondary education (general, primary teacher training,
commercial, technical and agricultural) as well as the training of secondary
school teachers at university level. During appraisal it was found that
the measures already taken by the Schools of Education of the National and
Central American Universities would satisfy the demand for secondary school
teachers by 1973 and that the Bank project, consequently, could be limited
to the expansion of secondary education. This included the following items:
(i) construction of a new technical institute to train industrial techni-
cians, (ii) construction or extension of three primary teacher training
schools, (iii) construction or extension of 18 general secondary schools
(most of them with commercial streams), of which one would have a teacher
training stream and three would have agricultural streams.
1.03      It was found upon appraisal that the proposals for a technical
institute and agricultural streams in three secondary schools, although
urgently needed to fill serious gaps in the provision of qualified manpower,
were not ready for appraisal and could not be retained without serious de-
lay to the project as a whole. The government is continuing the prepara-
tion of a technical institute with a view to submitting it in a second
request for assistance, but has dropped the plans to introduce agricultural
streams in secondary schools and will continue to operate the existing
agricultural lycees in their present form.
1.04      The remaining items, consisting of three primary teacher training
schools and 18 general secondary schools, were soundly prepared and con-
stitute the proposed project.
Social and Economic Background
1.05      Nicaragua occupies about 147,500 square kilometers and has a
population estimated at 1.7 million, the major part of which is concentra-
ted in the coastal plains and mountain highlands of the western half of
the country where all cities of any importance are situated. The eastern
half of the country, covered with tropical forests and swamps, is sparsely
populated.



- 2 -
1.06      The rural population accounts for 58% of the total at present
but is expected to decline to 54% in 1974.  About 58% of the economically
active population is engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing, 1% in
mining, 16% in manufacturing industry, construction and public utilities,
and 25% in transport, communications, commerce and the public services.
GDP per head of the population in 1965 was $325.
1.07      About 35% of the country's GDP in 1965 was earned in agriculture,
forestry and fishing; mining contributed 1.5%, manufacturing industry, con-
struction and public utilities 17.5%; transport, communications, commerce
and other services 46%. Main export crops are cotton and coffee.    The
manufacturing industry is expanding rapidly; although still mainly engaged
in the production of food, beverages, textiles and some building materials,
recent expansion has been in metals and chemicals.
2. EDUCATION AND TRAINING
Organization and Administration
2.01      The formal education system comprises:   (i) a primary course of
six grades, (ii) a secondary of five grades, and (iii) higher education
(Annex 1). About 16% of the students in primary, 36% in secondary and 30%
in higher education are enrolled in private institutions. The public pri-
mary system is free and attendance at this level is obligatory.
2.02      The Minister of Education is responsible for policy, control and
supervision of the system except for the universities which are autonomous.
He exercises his functions through five directorates (Annex 2). He is
advised by the directorate heads, a small Planning Department and by a Tech-
nical Council which reviews programs and proposals submitted by the direc-
torates.
2.03      The administrative machine has so far failed to adjust to the
changing situation in the schools - to the reforms which have been intro-
duced (see para. 2.13), expansion at all levels and new activities. Con-
trol and supervision has been lax, principally because of inadequate
resources. Reinforcement on the basis of sound selection procedures, train-
ing and retraining of personnel have become imperative, also a demarcation
of areas of responsibility and establishment of lines of coordination and a
National Advisory Council of wider representation than the full-time profes-
sional Technical Council. The supervisory service needs reorganization to
function as a counseling, training, evaluation, liaison and experimentation
unit of the Ministry. The Planning Department should accelerate prepara-
tion of comprehensive, long-term and medium-term plan proposals. In all
these matters the government has taken or is considering action which will
assure improvement in the coming years. Since the appraisal in December,
1966, the government-has strengthened the planning department and is con-
sidering the decentralization and improvement of the school supervision



system. The National University meanwhile has developed programs for the
training of school inspectors and other supervisory staff and of school
directors.
Primary Education
2.o4      Enrollment in 1965/66 in primary level institutions was 215,000.
Enrollments in primary schools have almost doubled since 1950 (Annex 3).
2.05      The serious deficiencies of the primary system - late entry,
irregular attendance, wide age range in each grade, massing of students in
the first grade, high rates of dropout and repetition - are shown in Annexes
4 and 5. The main reasons for the low output are the great number of
schools (90%) which do not provide the full six-year course and the rigid
system of annual promotion examinations. Since the output of primary schools
is more than adequate for the present and planned future intake into the
secondary schools, these deficiencies do not endanger the successful imple-
mentation of the proposed project.
2.06      Although the training of primary school teachers has been greatly
increased in recent years, the supply of teachers is still inadequate.
The average teacher-pupil ratio is 1:42 but is much higher in the oversized
classes of the urban schools. Of the teaching force 57% are still unquali-
fied, as compared with 79% in 1959. (Annex 6) The trained teachers are
not of a high academic level and their professional training has shortcom-
ings. Reorganization and reform of the teacher training schools has begun
and from 1968 a further year of studies is to be added. In particular,
students are to be trained in multiple class teaching techniques (the si-
multaneous handling by one teacher of more than one class). Up-grading
courses for teachers in service have recently been introduced.
Secondary Education
2.07      Secondary schools (both public and private) in 1966/67 numbered
138 with 27,108 students or 15% of the age group 13-17; excluding the over-
age pupils, the participation rate is about 10% (Annex 7). Entry into
the secondary schools is at present open to all who have obtained a primary
school leaving certificate; about 92% of primary school graduates entered
secondary schools in 1966, as compared with 64% in 1960.
2.08      Secondary education comprises a basic cycle of three grades with
a core curriculum common to all, and a diversified cycle of two or three
years directed towards (i) general studies, (ii) commercial (accounts or
secretarial) studies, (iii) agricultural studies, and (iv) primary school
teacher training. Vocational schools take primary school leavers over two-,
three- or four-year courses. The curricula in commercial and teacher-
training schools give too much emphasis to the development of skills. The
general secondary curriculum is on the whole well-balanced with special
emphasis on science and mathematics.



- 4 -
2.09      In 1968 the annual workload will be increased to 37 weeks a
year, or about 185 working days which is satisfactory but the weekly load
in most schools is 30 periods of 40 minutes each which is inadequate for
the purposes of building up the revised curricula. It is recommended that
the weekly class workload should be 35 periods as soon as the increased
school facilities allow the secondary schools to operate on a single shift
basis.
2.10      In secondary education the same deficiencies are found as in
primary schools - an excessive number of "dropouts" and repeaters, wide
age range in each grade, poor teaching and equipment, insufficient supplies
and money. In relation to the inputs into secondary education, the output
both in quality and quantity is very low (Annex 8).
2.11      Apart from a few new schools, the public secondary schools are
unsuitable housed. Many of the buildings are old converted houses, others
are too antiquated and/or too badly located for the necessary expansion
or addition of the type c teaching spaces essential to the application of
modern curricula. Equipment and teaching aids are at a minimum in almost
all schools. The project is designed to deal with the deficiencies out-
lined in these paragraphs (see paragraphs 3.14 and 3.15).
2.12      The rigid system of annual promotion examinations contributes
to the low productivity; the greatest obstacle to quality, however, is the
teaching force and the conditions of appointment. Almost all the teachers
are part time and teach in two or more schools, except in teacher-training
schools. Few are academically prepared and professionally trained to han-
dle classes at the secondary level. Sample surveys suggest that only 15-
20% of the teaching force is qualified; for mathematics and physics, only
5% appear to be fully qualified. However, the School of Education of the
National University has expanded intake and in-service courses, and the
private Central American University opened a School of Education last year.
Both schools offer courses in pedagogical sciences, social studies, liter-
ature, biology-chemistry, and mathematics-physics for the degree of
"professor of secondary education." The School of Education of the National
University recently started a course in English and is planning new courses
in industrial arts, home economics and other subjects not previously pro-
vided. A considerable part of the secondary school graduates and the pri-
mary school teachers now employed as secondary school teachers, are attend-
ing in-service courses (Annex 9).
These activities promise a greatly improved teaching force in the near
future.



-5-
2.13      Present teaching methods are traditional and uninspired; the
emphasis is on memorization with little regard to understanding, investi-
gation or problem-solving; exceptions are the primary teacher-training
schools where the work is more purposeful. Fortunately, there is evidence
of the possibility of rapid improvement. Apart from the above-mentioned
rapid increase in the training of teachers, measures have been initiated
to further reform the curricula. Another major reform, which will take
effect in the coming years, is the restructuring of the secondary school
system aiming at a greater diversification and a more rational use of re-
sources by:
(i)    integrating commercial courses into the second
cycle of general secondary schools:
(ii)   concentrating the training of primary school
teachers in four establishments, and starting
the training at second cycle level over a three-
year course;
(iii)  offering three-year courses, at second cycle
level, in the three agricultural schools estab-
lished in 1966 with French assistance;
(iv)   organizing technician-level education;
(v)    restricting recently established schools with
limited catchment areas to the basic cycle level.
2.14      TechnicalfVocaticnal Education  The National Technical Vocation-
al Institute of the Ministry of Education offers full-time and part-time
courses of craft training (Annex 10). Short courses are provided by the
Army authorities and, with the assistance of US AID advisers, by the Min-
istry of Labor at its National Apprenticeship Institute. Religious orders
are also engaged in craft training. The Ministry of Labor proposes to
offer part-time courses for craftsmen seeking to obtain technician status.
There is as yet no institution concerned with the training of middle-level
industrial technicians.
2.15      Agricultural Education  The three agricultural lycees, which
offer a two-year course leading to the diploma of "Bachiller en Agricultura"
and a third-year course of essentially agricultural technician training
are operating in temporary buildings with no practical teaching spaces.



- 6 -
The private International School of Agriculture at Rivas offers a three-
year program. The government proposes to introduce some agricultural
studies into the curriculum of the basic cycle of certain secondary schools.
2.16      Projected Expansion of Secondary Education    The government would
be well advised to introduce selective procedures for entry into the secon-
dary schools as from May 1968 in order to prevent the overloading of the
school facilities and to maintain standards (Annexes 11 and 12). Assuming
that controlled admission would reduce the number of entrants into secon-
dary education from more than 90% to about 65% of primary school leavers
in 1972, total enrollment in the secondary day schools of all types is
estimated at 42,000 in 1972/73 and 47,000 in 1975. As a percentage of the
age group 13-17 years, those targets would represent a rise from 15.6% in
1967 to 18.2% in 1972 and 18.5% in 1975.
Higher Education
2.17      Entry into the National University at Leon and Managua, to the
Central American University at Managua, to the National School of Agricul-
ture near Managua and to the nursing schools is open to graduates of the
general secondary schools. The Faculty of Humanities of the National
University accepts also graduates of the teacher-training schools. The
Faculty of Engineering of the National University offers non-degree, shorter
courses in surveying and is considering similar courses in engineering and
construction.
2.18      Total enrollment at the three establishments of university status
in 1966/67 was 3,919 (Annex 13). The "dropout" rate is very high, especi-
ally in the first two years, and is attributed to poor quality intake and
to financial constraints affecting students' full-time attendance. Conse-
quently, productivity in relation to initial first year enrollment and to
financial inputs is low.
2.19      Between 1951 and 1966, 1,807 students were graduated by the
National University; almost 70% of these graduated in Medicine and Law.
In 1965/66 these two faculties, however, accounted for less than 50% of
the number of graduates as new faculties began to attract students. The
National University is proposing to expand enrollment in 1972 to 6,735
with an intake of 2,710. The Central American University will increase
its first year intake in 1967 to 1,030 and is preparing for further expan-
sion. Plans to double the number of graduates from the National School
of Agriculture are under consideration.
The Cost of Education
Financing of Education
2.20      With the exception of an insignificant number of municipal pri-
mary schools, all institutions of public education are financed by the
central government through its central budget which covers both capital



- 7 -
and recurrent costs of the schools. School fees have been abolished for
primary education and the government proposes to do the same in respect
of secondary education in the near future.
2.21      In higher education, the National University is autonomous but
is financially largely dependent on government grants; tuition and other
fees account for about 16% of the University's budget. The National School
of Agriculture is financed by the Ministry of Agriculture.
2.22      Private initiative plays a significant role in the provision of
education in Nicaragua. The major part of the income of private schools
and of the private Central American University originates from school fees.
The government gives some financial support to private schools but the
total amount of these subsidies is small (Annex 14) and lacks any legal
or statutory basis. The subsidies to each private school are somewhat
arbitrarily fixed by Congress each year.
2.23      The heavy reliance of private schools on income from fees would
indicate that the share of private education in total enrollments will
decline. Economic considerations suggest that the government might inves-
tigate a greater and more systematic subsidization of private schools
(either in the form of direct grants to these schools or, indirectly, in
the form of scholarships to pupils in private schools) to encourage avail-
able private initiative to continue its share in the total educational
effort.
Total Expenditure on Education
2.24      Total public expenditure on education rose sharply from C$38.4
million in 1960/61 to C$91.4 million in 1966 but is still well below the
average amount per capita spent in the five Central American republics as
a whole. The above mentioned figures represent a virtually constant share
of the total government budget of only 15.5% compared with an average of
more than 20% for Central America (Annexes 15 and 16). Private expenditure
on education is unknown but can be estimated at about C$25 million in 1966
(Annex 14), which brings the total of all national expenditure on education
in 1966 to about Cr$117 million, or 3% of the country's Gross National Pro-
duct - a percentage which is small in comparison with many other developing
countries.
2.25      The budget of the Ministry of Education, at C$87.7 million (1966),
accounts for the major share of total educational expenditure, and covers
both recurrent and capital expenditure on public schools. Its percentage
share in the total government budget rose from 14.4% in 1960/61 to 17.1%
in 1963/64 but has since then declined to 15.0% in 1966 (Annex 15). The
contribution of other ministries, at C$3.7 million, is not very high. Ex-
penditure on private schools, after subtracting government subsidies, is
conservatively estimated at C$15 million. Private contributions to public
schools in the form of fees were about C$2.5 million. Budgets for 1966/67
of the National and the Central American University, after subtracting the
government grant, are C$7.6 million (Annex 1L4).



- 8-
Public Expenditure on Education
2.26      Of the relatively small proportion of the total public budget
which is appropriated to education, the greater part is still spent on
primary education (Annex 16). Including adult education, primary education
claimed nearly 60% of the budget of the Ministry of Education in 1966.
The share of secondary education, on the other hand, has declined from 19.4%
in 1960/61 to 16.4% in 1966. Nearly half of this amount is spent on gener-
al secondary schools, nearly one-third on primary teacher training and
about 18% on commercial, technical and agricultural education. Higher edu-
cation increased its share in the education budget from 5.7% in 1960/61 to
6.8% in 1966. To enable the government to implement its secondary educa-
tion programs the share of secondary education should be gradually increased
(see para. 2.33). Government assurances to this effect have been obtained.
2.27      Outlay on school construction and major maintenance work (both
by the Ministry of Education and by the Ministry of Public Works) accounts
for only 5.6% of public educational expenditure.
2.28      A further analysis of public expenditure on education shows that
the major part of the budget is spent on salaries and other personnel ex-
penditure and, to a lesser extent, on scholarships and boarding expenses.
The provision for recurrent material expenses is far below normal standards.
Resources available for maintenance and repairs, for the pruchase of teach-
ing materials and the replacement of equipment and furniture have dropped
to such low levels that the quality of education is adversely affected.
Steps should be taken to fix the appropriations for material expenditure
at more normal levels. To that effect assurances have been obtained from
the government that in the annual budget for each completed school a sum
equal to not less than 15% of the allocation for teachers' salaries will
be made available for the maintenance of buildings and equipment and for
the supply of teaching materials. This sum will include provision for
the maintenance of buildings equal to at least 1.5% of the construction
costs. In addition, assurances have been obtained that the standards of
maintenance and equipment in the other secondary schools will be gradually
raised to those in the project schools (see para. h.26).
2.29      Teachers' salaries have risen by some 50% between 1960/61 and
1966. A further increase at the end of 1966 has brought salaries to double
the 1960/61 level. Contrary to the practice in primary education, teacher
training and technical secondary education, where teachers' salaries are
fixed on a monthly basis, teachers in general secondary and commercial
schools are paid by the hour. The practice of hourly pay encourages teach-
ers to maximize their number of teaching hours and to divide their atten-
tion between a number of schools, which adversely affects the quality of
instruction. Steps should be taken to revise this policy and assurances
have been obtained from the government that, in addition to the appointment
of full-time teachers in the project schools, the practice of paying teach-
ers' salaries on an hourly basis will be discontinued as soon as possible
for the secondary school system as a whole (see paragraphs 2.12 and 5.09
point (i)).



- 9-
Future Expenditure Levels
2.30      Trends in the school population indicate that enrollments in
primary education -will probably rise from 215,481 in 1965/66 to 300,000 in
1972/73, whereas secondary education can be expected to grow from 26,882
in 1965/66 to some 42,000 in 1972/73 (Annex 12). Enrollments in the Nation-
al University are planned to rise from 2,557 in 1966 to 6,735 in 1972.
2.31      Teachers' salaries rose by 50% between 1960 and 1966, and, for
the purpose of this cost estimate, are assumed to rise by the same percen-
tage between 1966 and 1972. This is a very conservative estimate since
the increase in teachers' salaries by 33% at the end of 1966 leaves room
for a further increase of only 17% between 1967 and 1972. It has been
assumed that the provision for material expenditure will be increased to
the levels recommended in paragraph 2.28.
2.32      On these assumptions the budget of the Ministry of Education can
be expected to grow by 152% from C$88 million in 1966 to C$221 million in
1972. C$32 million would be the total recurrent expenditure of the project
schools (Annex 17). Of this amount C$19 million represent the recurrent
costs of the expansion of existing schools and the new schools to be con-
structed under the project. Of the estimated total increase in expenditure
for primary and secondary education about 40% would be due to increased
enrollments, 43% to higher salaries (partly a result of improvement in
teachers' qualifications), 8% to better provisions for material expenses
and 7% to the diversification of secondary education (new forms of techni-
cal and agricultural education). The total increase of 152% compares with
a growth of 146% in the previous six-year period, 1960/61 to 1966; but,
unlike the earlier period, the projected growth for 1966-1972 will most
probably require a substantially greater share of the total government bud-
get. The education budget for 1972 might well claim about 22% of the total
budget. This rising trend in an important and rather inflexible category
of government expenditure will require restraint by the government in other
categories of expenditure and a conscious effort to raise new budgetary
funds for investment during the coming years. In view of the government's
present policies and Nicaragua's future prospects, the government should
be able to provide the complementary local financing for the proposed
project.
2.33      A second important change, indicated in the above figures, should
be the redistribution of the education budget among levels of education.
The share of primary education should be reduced from 59% to about 50% and
that of secondary and higher education should be increased (Annex 17).
Agreement has been reached during negotiations that a greater share of the
education budget will be allocated to secondary education.
3. NEED FOR THE PROJECT
Existing Manpower Situation
3.01      The present lack of sufficiently educated and qualified manpower
is one of the most serious obstacles to further economic growth. The agri-
cultural, industrial and commercial sectors all report serious deficiencies



- 10 -
in the existing supply of trained manpower and a much needed improvement
in productivity is considered unattainable without a substantial upgrading
of the labor force. In a number of sectors the productivity of high-level
personnel is adversely affected by the lack of medium-level manpower.
3.02      This general impression is confirmed by the existing data concern-
ing the educational attainment of the existing labor force. The percentages
of personnel with completed secondary and higher education are extremely low,
even for the professional and sub-professional and managerial groups and for
the office personnel and salesmen:
Educational Level of Labor Force, 1963 (in percentages)
University   Secondary   Primary   Rest    Total
Professional and
sub-professional      12.4         30.8       36.6     20.2   100.0
Managerial               9.9         27.0       21.8     41.3   100.0

Salesmen                 0.4          4.4       15.8     79.4   100.0
Farmers                   -          0.1         1.2     98.7   100.0

Total                    0.4         2.7         7.2     89.7   100.0

Table A-II-17
Comparable figures for the whole of Central America show that the percen-
tage of the labor force which has a University education in Nicaragua at
0.4% is considerably below the average for the five Central American repub-
lics, which is 0.6%. The percentage for secondary education is about the
same as that for the Central American region.
3.03      The percentages reflect the inadequacies in numbers but do not
reveal the deficiencies in quality of graduates from secondary and higher
education institutions nor the imbalance in specialization. There is gen-
eral dissatisfaction with the quality of students now graduating at secon-
dary level. The National University reported a gradual decline in the per-
formance of new entrants and, in spite of corrective measures, 40-50% of
its students withdraw during the first year; employers in industry and
commerce also stated that an improvement in the quality of secondary edu-
cation was badly needed. Manpower requirements will not be met by a purely
quantitative increase in secondary enrollments but require also a simultan-
eous improvement in quality.
3.04      Of equal importance is the imbalance in specializations.   Until
now secondary education has been almost entirely academic, leading to
university entrance, teacher training, or some commercial education. Mid-
dle level technician training for industry and agriculture is virtually
lacking.



- 11 -
3.05      The proposed project would assist with all the above-mentioned
problems. The provision of new places and the anticipated improvement of
the holding power of the schools would result in a substantial increase
in the number of secondary school graduates. The qualitative effects of
the project, described in paragraphs 3.14 and 3.15, would also be signifi-
cant. Finally, the addition of commercial and science courses and the
introduction of industrial arts, as part of a broader curriculum, should
partly redress the over-emphasis on academic studies.
Need for the Expansion of Secondary Education
3.06      A conservative estimate of the need for medium-level personnel
was made by the Superior Council of Central American Universities (CSUCA)
for the period 1963-1974. To attain a moderate increase in the educational
level of the Nicaraguan labor force in order to raise productivity levels,
the council calculated that the stock of personnel with completed secondary
education should rise from 12,900 in 1963 to 29,100 in 1974 and 19,700
secondary school level personnel should therefore enter the labor force in
the period under review. Even with this increase, the proportion of per-
sonnel with completed secondary education would only rise from 2.7% to 4.9%
of the total labor force and not more than 43.0% of the professional and
sub-professional group, 27% of the managerial group, 32.3% of the office
workers and 4.6% of the salesmen would have completed secondary education.
3.07      A more recent study, made by the Planning Office of the National
Economic Council in 1V66, made manpower estimates for professional occupa-
tions which approximate to the CSUCA report but indicated higher needs for
office and sales personnel. Using these data, it is calculated that the
need for secondary level personnel is 1,600 higher than the CSUCA figure
which brings the requirements of new entrants into the labor market at
about 21,300 by 1974.
3.08      The new total includes the demand for commercial graduates and
for primary school teachers. The shortage of commercial personnel is great;
the smaller private commercial firms especially report difficulties in
recruiting sufficiently qualified personnel for office and sales positions.
The need for newly trained accountants (public and private) and secretaries
up to 1974 is estimated at 3,050, a number which does not include other
positions, such as general office and sales work, for which commercial
graduates are used.
3.09      The requirements for primary school teachers can be estimated
as follows: the expected enrollments of 312,000 pupils in 1974 will re-
quire a staff of 7,800 teachers. The present number of qualified teachers
is only 2,124 of whom, after allowing for some wastage, not more than 1,600
can be expected to be in service in 1974. The need for additional teachers
by 1974 can therefore be estimated at 6,200. Allowance should be made for
the fact that some 20% of the normal school graduates will fail to take up
appointment in primary schools because they enter the university or for
other reasons. This brings the total number to be trained in the period
1966-1974 to 7,750, or about 850 annually.



- 12 -
3.10      The intake into higher education institutions, moreover, will
grow rapidly in the coming years. The expansion plans of the National
and the Central American Universities are ambitious and will raise the
intake into all institutions of higher education to above 3,600 in 1972.
Half the number of entrants into the universities drop out during the first
years, however, and should therefore be considered as entering the labor
market with completed secondary education only.
3.11      The present output of secondary schools is insufficient to meet
the total estimated requirement of 21,300 during the period 1965-1974. Of
the 2,474 graduates who left secondary schools in 1966, including 616 pri-
mary school teachers (some of whom enter the Universities) and 248 commer-
cial graduates, some 1,800 or nearly 75% were absorbed by higher education
institutions. Even if allowance is made for the fact that nearly half of
them will drop out of higher education during the first year, the remaining
number is insufficient to meet the demand for primary school teachers, com-
mercially trained workers and other medium-level personnel.
3.12      The anticipated expansion of secondary education (including the
proposed project) would raise the annual output of all 'secondary schools
to 4,820 by 1973 (Annex 8). This number would still be insufficient for
the needs described in paragraphs 3.07 to 3.10 above but would form a con-
siderable improvement compared with the existing situation. After subtract-
ing half the planned number of entrants into higher education, the number
of those who will enter the labor force after completing secondary education
will be about 3,004 compared with 1,600 in 1966. Their total number over
the period 1965-1974 will be about 20,000 which figure can be compared with
the requirements of 21,300 mentioned in paragraph 3.07.
3.13      The expected annual output of the secondary schools of 4,820 in
1973 will include 3,200 graduates from the general secondary streams, which
give access to higher education. This number is still below the expected
intake into higher education of more than 3,600. It should further include
800 graduates from the teacher training schools, or a total output of about
7,500 primary teachers over the period 1965-1974. The number of graduates
from the commercial streams will rise to 660 annually, giving a total out-
put over the period 1965-1974 of about 4,000 graduates. Since some two-
thirds of the latter are women, a number of them will not remain in the
labor market.
Qualitative Considerations
3.14      The secondary education system is in urgent need of qualitative
improvements and a more rational use of available resources. The proposed
project would meet the qualitative requirements directly by the provision
of functional teaching spaces and modern equipment, especially for practi-
cal, scientific and commercial studies. Congestion in existing secondary
schools, which share their facilities with other institutions to their own
detriment, would be diminished. A more economic use of teachers and mater-
ial would be attained by replacing small units with larger ones. A more



- 13 -
diversified program of secondary studies, to include science, industrial
arts, commerce and home economics, would give pupils a wider choice after
completing the basic cycle.
3.15      The project should also be instrumental in iiiproving the quality
of instruction by requiring better qualified and full-time staff, a modern-
ized curriculum, and an increase in the annual workload (see paras. 2.09,
2.12 and 4.05). Another aspect of considerable significance is that the
revised curricula are appropriate to a type of secondary education which
is not only a stepping stone to university education but also a form of
terminal education. Secondary school graduates will have received an edu-
cation which enhances their value as middle-level workers. The reorganiza-
tion and improvement of primary teacher training should increase the quality
of primary school leavers entering secondary education. Since most of the
improved facilities for secondary education will be used by the community
at large, the country's adult education and training programs and community
development programs could be extended throughout the greater part of the
country.
4. THE PROJECT
Technical Features
General
4.01      The proposed project consists of (a) the construction and equip-
ment of two new primary teacher training schools and the extension of a
third, (b) the construction and equipment of nine new general secondary
schools, (c) the extension and equipment of seven other general secondary
schools and (d) the equipping of two existing general secondary schools.
The location of the proposed schools accords with the geographic distribu-
tion of the population (see map). The project is expected to be completed
in four years.
4.02      The number of new places to be provided in the project is 11,540
of which 3,440 would be in replacement of existing unsuitable facilities
and 8,100 would be additional secondary places. Total enrollments in the
21 schools would consequently rise by the latter number from 10,500 students
at present to 18,600 in 1972; the latter figure represents 44% of total
secondary enrollments in 1972. The estimated maximum output of graduates
from the project schools would ultimately rise to 2,730 or 57% of the anti-
cipated total number of secondary school graduates.

Total    10,500        6,100               2,730



- 14 -
4.03      Eight of the eleven new school buildings would replace existing
schools with unsuitable facilities. In a number of these cases the schools
are now accommodated in the overcrowded facilities of other secondary
schools and should move to m4ke room for the expansion of the latter. In
another case the school is temporarily housed in a provisional structure
of limited durability. In other instances, the schools are housed in build-
ings which are unsuitable for secondary education, lacking in science facil-
ities and practical teaching spaces, and generally overcrowded. The age,
condition or location of the buildings make renovation and extension either
impossible or undesirable. Where publicly owned, these buildings would be
used for other educational purposes, such as primary schools or boarding
houses.
4.04      In two cases the proposed construction or expansion of schools
was deleted from the proposed project - in one case because the existing
school was considered adequate, in the other because construction had al-
ready started and will be completed before negotiations - but the provision
of equipment for these schools has been included. Equipment lists for the
schools have been reviewed and are at present being revised by the Ministry
of Education.
4.05      To ensure that the development of secondary education is in accord-
ance with the needs and to safeguard the quality of education in the project
schools, assurances have been obtained from the government that the enroll-
ment structure of the project schools will conform to the Schedule given in
Annex 18.
Teacher Training Schools
4.06      The total enrollment of 1,925 in the three teacher training
schoolswould include 1,505 new places provided by the project. The annual
output of graduates from the schools would be 560. After the reorganiza-
tion of teacher training in 1968, students would be admitted to the schools
after completion of the first cycle of secondary education for a three-year
course, see paragraph 2.13 (ii).     Boarding facilities are not needed in
the school in Managua; private boarding facilities at the other two sites
are limited and, as students come from all parts of the country, boarding
facilities for 430 students, with small apartments for supervisory-teaching
staff, would be included in the proposed project.
4.07      With the extension of the teacher training course to three years,
it has been possible to improve substantially the curriculum. Essential
subjects such as language, mathematics and science are now included on an
increased scale throughout the course; practical activities are continued
from the basic cycle. Students are to receive guidance and practice in
administration and teaching in small multiple-grade schools and in prepar-
ing improvised apparatus and supplementary teaching materials.



- 15 -
4.08      The project would provide teaching spaces and ecquipment appro-
priate to this new curriculum and the extra-curricular activities of the
schools and make possible the application of accepted modern educational
practices.
4.09      The teachers in most of the existing schools are sufficiently
competent to teach effectively in the new institutions. All are experien-
ced and most have had training abroad. The fellowship program for further
upgrading the teacher-trainers is to continue. The few additional teacher-
trainers required by 1972 are available locally.
General Secondary Schools
4.10      Of the 18 general secondary schools which are to be constructed,
extended or equipped only, one would have a teacher training stream and
thirteen would have commercial streams with preparation for accountant and
secretarial work in addition to the general streams which stress mathema-
tics and science.  Total enrollments in these schools would be 16,680 of
which 10,035 would be new places provided by the project. The annual intake
of the schools would rise to 4,480 entrants, which number would be met
from the anticipated increase in the output of primary schools (Annex 11).
In none of the cases is it necessary to provide for the construction of
boarding facilities, with the exception of one school with a large catch-
ment area where a hostel for 80 boys is planned.
4.11      The proposed curricula are practicable and well-balanced in both
first and second cycles. While maintaining a sound general education for
all students they would offer orientation towards practical work in the
first cycle and diversification in general and commercial (accounts and
secretarial) streams in the second cycle. The project would provide appro-
priate teaching spaces and equipment to implement this program of diversi-
fied instruction.
4.12      With a teacher-pupil ratio in 1973 of 1:26 the secondary school
system would require a full-time teaching force of some 1,700 including
directors.  Some 1,300 of these teachers should be university graduates,
at least for the teaching of mathematics, sciences, languages, social
studies and some of the commercial subjects.
4.13      Of the present stock of qualified secondary school teachers, some
100 will be in service in 1973. The estimated output of the regular and
full-vacation courses of the Schools of Education of the National and Centra'
American Universities between 1967 and 1973 is 1,250. The overall need for
university graduate-level teachers will therefore be met by 1973. The re-
maining 400 teachers, mainly of practical subjects, would be provided by
training schemes now being developed.
4.14      The required number of teachers for each of the specialities is
now assured as a result of recent action by the School of Education of the



- 16 -
National University to match the teacher supply by subject to the needs
of the secondary school system.
4.15      It is essential for the successful implementation of the project
that directors of schools should be appointed by sound selection procedures.
4.16      The training of supervisory staff and of school administrators
is assured by training programs which were recently developed by the School
of Education of the National University.
Cost of the Project
4.17      The total cost of the project is estimated at C$56.2 million or
about US $8.0 million equivalent, as shown below. Annex 19 gives further

4.18      The Government of Nicaragua would provide the land necessary for
the construction of the project schools. In most cases the land is already
government owned or could be obtained by the government at nominal cost.
No difficulty is foreseen in the selection and acquisition of the sites.
Assurances have been obtained that the sites not yet acquired at the time
of the signing of the loan agreement will be obtained within twelve months
after the loan agreement is signed.
4.19      There has been an increase in building costs of about 2% per
annum during the past four years, and this has remained fairly constant
in spite of the sharp increase in building volume in the last two years -
58% in 1964/65 and 69% in 1965/66. The proposed project schools would
mean an increase of about 10%-15% per year to the country's 1965/66 build-
ing volume (Approx: US $17 million); the construction and building indus-
try should be able to cope with this further increase in building activity
without difficulty, but the increase in costs can be expected to continue
as in previous years. It is for these reasons that an average price in-
crease allowance of 6% has been provided in the cost of the project.
Similarly, an allowance of 10% of the value, based on past experience, has
been made as a contingency for unanticipated construction and site plan-
ning problems.
4.20      Schedules of accommodation follow austere standards and are con-
sistent with functional needs. It is expected that most schools would be
designed as one-story buildings and they have been costed accordingly. In
a few cases, due to site limitations and topography, costs for some of these
schools have been based on a two-story concept. The average cost per day
pupil place including furniture and equipment for completely new schools
in the project are, for a one-story construction about US $510, for a two-
story construction about US $600 and for one-story dormitories with bachelor
staff apartments about US $1,030. Equipment lists are still under revision
but the estimated costs assure reasonable provision of equipment at realis-
tic cost.
Execution of the Project
4.21      General   Architectural design and building construction vary con-
siderably throughout the country; imaginative design and good construction
is found in Managua and the larger towns where the building activity has
been concentrated in recent years. In rural areas design and construction
are of a lower quality because of economic limitations rather than lack of
competent professional service.
4.22      There are no national building by-laws, fire or health regula-
tions.  Some larger towns have their own regulations geyierally vith eiripha-
sis on land use, zoning and town planning.



- 18 -
4.23      Architectural and engineering practices follow an acceptable sys-
tem of "lump-sum" contracts.
4.24      Construction Firms   There are about ten large construction firms
with experience in comparatively large-sized projects including multi-story
structures and 35 medium and smaller firms. They would appear to be tech-
nically competent and reasonably equipped. With the hub of the construction
and the building industry at Managua, there is a good geographic distribu-
tion of capable contractors in the Pacific coast region of the country,
where all but one of the proposed project schools would be built (see map).
4.25      Impnortation and Procurement   At present the importation and pro-
curement of all building materials is the responsibility of builders' mer-
chants. Occasionally, the government has imported materials direct and
issued them to builders. Customs duty is not imposed on materials imported
for any government project. Procurement procedures for furniture and equip-
ment and for all construction would follow international competitive
bidding. If the government decides to import the construction materials
directly, international competitive bidding should also be followed in the
procurement of these materials.
4.26      Operation and Maintenance    Recent school construction has fol-
lowed standard designs prepared by the Ministry of Public Works. The
structures are simple and space standards generally acceptable, but site
planning and building layout are not always satisfactory. The specifica-
tions and materials used are suitable to local conditions.
4.27      The maintenance and upkeep of school premises is generally unsat-
isfactory. Assurances have been obtained from the government that the re-
current expenditure budgets for the project schools will contain annual
allocations for maintenance equal to at least 1.5% of their construction
costs (see para. 2.28). The Ministry of Public Works should continue to
be responsible for the regular inspection and repair of school premises.
4.28      Design Approach   The climatological conditions in all the loca-
tions of the proposed project make possible a unified design approach. It
is recommended that basic building components should be standardized as
much as practicable for the entire project, to take advantage of mass pro-
duction, modular coordination and buying in quantity. It is further pro-
posed that maintenance minimizing items, such as acrylic plastics in lieu
of glass, should be integrated into the designs, if costs are competitive.
These recommendations were discussed during negotiations.
4.29      Professional and Technical Services    Design and execution of
school buildings rests with the Building Construction and Maintenance
Department, Ministry of Public Works. For the proposed project the design
and supervision could not be entirely absorbed by the Ministry of Public
Works, and the government would employ local architectural firms, acceptable



- 19 -
to the Bank and on terms and conditions to be approved by the Bank. There
are a number of architects with experience in school building design and
the supply of professional manpower should be sufficient for the implemen-
tation of the project.
4.30      A project implementation team would be set up in the Ministry
of Education, which would be responsible for the direction and overall
supervision of the project. The project implementation team would be
headed by a full-time project director; a project architect assisted by
supporting technical staff would be appointed from the staff of the
Ministry of Public Works as a full-time member of the team. The appoint-
ment of both the project director and the project architect would be
subject to approval by the Bank and would be a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed loan. Candidates to fill the positions of project direc-
tor and project architect were submitted by the government during negoti-
ations.
4.31      Tendering and Contract Awards    The present procedures used by
the Ministry of Public Works for tendering and awarding of contracts are
acceptable. With a few exceptions, tendering is public and award of con-
tracts rests with a special commission within the Ministry, with the Minis-
ter of Public Works or Vice-Minister, always as a member of the commission.
4.32      Supervision   The private architectural firm(s) selected for the
schools would be responsible for the supervision and certification of con-
tractors' bills. The project architect would make periodic site inspections
and scrutinize and recommend all payments to contractors. Constant super-
intendence would be provided by the Ministry of Public Works.
4.33      Financing of the Project   The total cost of the project is esti-
mated at US $8 million of which the foreign exchange component is presently
estimated at US $2.7 million. The proposed Bank loan of US $4 million
would finance 50 percent of the total project costs and would, therefore,
on the basis of present estimates, cover about 25 percent of the total
local costs. The balance of costs, representing 50 percent of the total
project costs, would be financed through budgetary appropriations.
4.34      Disbursements   For equipment, the Bank would disburse 100 percent
of the foreign exchange costs thereof. For construction contracts, profes-
sional services and furniture, the Bank would disburse on the basis of a
percentage which is presently established at 45 percent of the total cost
of these items. In case of a change in the total cost of the project (in-
cluding the contingencies), the percentage would be adjusted in order
(i) to maintain, to the extent practicable, an average contribution of 50
percent by the Bank towards the total cost of the Project, (ii) to maintain
the Bank's contribution towards the foreign exchange cost of equipment at



- 20 -
100 percent thereof and (iii) to spread disbursements throughout the period
required to execute the project. If the total costs were less than estimated,
the contribution of the Bank would be maintained at 50 percent thereof and
would, consequently, be lower than US $4 million.
5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      Sustained economic growth in Nicaragua requires a greater supply
and a better quality of medium and higher level personnel (para. 3.01 et
seq). The proposed project, by providing better and expanded facilities
to secondary education, would meet urgent expansion and replacement needs
and would also improve the quality of secondary education. The project is
therefore a high priority need for the achievement of the country's devel-
opment objectives (paras. 3.11 and 3.14).
5.02      Recent reforms of the secondary school structure and curriculum
and proposed further developments assure a second level output consistent
with the needs of overall development plans. The curricula of the primary
teacher training schools and the secondary schools are well conceived
(paras. 4.07, 4.10 and 4.11). It is recommended that the weekly workload
should be increased to 35 periods as soon as possible and that selective
procedures for entry into the secondary schools should be introduced in
1968 in order to prevent the overloading of the school facilities and to
maintain standards (paras. 2.09 and 2.16).
5.03      Recent measures to expand and improve the training of teachers
for primary and secondary schools, and proposals for intensification of
these measures, promise an adequate and more relevantly trained teacher
supply (paras. 2.06, 2.12 and 2.13). Steps have been taken to assure that
not only the number but also the disciplines of secondary school teachers
are matched to the needs (paras. 4.13 and 4.14).
5.04      The supply of candidates for admission to the schools is ample
(Annex 11). The present and projected future demand for the output of the
schools assures sufficient opportunities for employment and for entry
into advanced studies (paras. 3.06, 3.13, and 4.13).
5.05      Most public schools are ill-housed and require replacement or
extension (paras. 2.11 and 4.03). The proposed schools are acceptable in
design and reasonable in cost; they would constitute a greatly improved
environment for learning and teaching for almost half the enrollment of
secondary education and would provide facilities for use by a more skilled
teacher force. Boarding facilities, including some staff housing, are
needed in only three schools and form only a minor part of the project
(paras. 4.06, 4.08, 4.10 and 4.11).



- 21 -
5.o6      The equipment lists for the schools have been reviewed and are
to be revised but estimated costs assure reasonable provision of equipment
at realistic cost (paras. 4.04 and 4.20).
5.07      Procurement procedures for furniture, equipment and civil works
would be in accord with international competitive bidding (para. 4.25).
Architectural, engineering and building contracting services of satisfac-
tory quality are available (paras. 4.24 and 4.29).
5.08      The share of capital cost of the project to be borne by Nicaragua
and the recurrent costs generated by the project would be within the finan-
cial capacity of the country (para. 2.32).
5.09      Assurances have been obtained on the following matters which
directly or indirectly affect the successful implementation of the project:
(i)    appointment of full-time teachers in project schools
and, by 1975, discontinuation of the practice of paying
teachers' salaries per hour (paras. 2.12 and 2.29);
(ii)   review of the examination system in order to reduce
the wastage and repetition rates (paras. 2.05 and 2.12);
(iii) adherence to the enrollment structure of the proj-
ect schools as given in Annex 18 (para. 4.05);
(iv)   adequate funds will be available for the proper
operation of the schools, the budgetary allocation to
education will be increased and a greater share will
be allocated to secondary education (paras. 2.32 and 2.33);
(v)    the provisions for material expenditure (as
against staff salaries)will be increased to assure the
proper maintenance of the school buildings and the prop-
er upkeep, regular replacement and modernization of
school equipment (paras. 2.28, 2.31 and 4.27);
(vi)   experienced private architectural firm(s) will
be employed to supplement the work done by the Ministry
of Public Works (para. 4.29);
(vii) the new sites for project schools which will not
have been acquired at the time of signing the loan agree-
ment will be obtained by the government within twelve
months thereafter (para. 4.18).
5.10      The following would be conditions of effectiveness of the proposed
loan:



- 22 -
(i)   a full-time project director, acceptable to the
Bank, with supporting staff for administration, procure-
ment and accounts, would be appointed in the Ministry
of Education (para. 4.30); and
(ii) a full-time project architect, acceptable to the
Bank, with additional staff would be appointed from
the Building Construction Department of the Ministry of
Public Works (para. 4.30).
5.11      Government proposals for candidates to fill the positions of
project director and project architect were presented during negotiations.
5.12      Subject to the assurances and the fulfillment of the conditions
described above, the project provides a suitable basis for a proposed loan
of US $4 million for 25 years, including a grace period of ten years.

*    The significance of this column is rather ambiguous since it includes the
total recurrent costs of all schools in the project, even those to which
the project makes only additions or for which it only provides the equip-
ment. The total amount in the column is, consequently, higher than what
could be properly described as the "recurrent cost implications of the
project." On the other hand: by setting and enforcing higher quality
standards in secondary education, the project might well raise the costs
in schools which are completely outside the project.

For construction work outside Managua, consideration for the increase in cost.
for transportation of materials and also for the higher wage scale for skille."
.abor from Managua, is necessary.  The cost per square meter in Managua is
taken as 100, and the local cost increase for each place where the project
schools are to be constructed have been adjusted as shown below:
Managua - 100       Esteli         - 120       Rivas      - 110
Carazo  - 105       Chontales     - 120        Chinandega - 110
