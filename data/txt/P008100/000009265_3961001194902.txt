MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO
FOR A BUSINESS EXPANOTLS AND INDUSTRIAL RESTRUCTURING PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago for US$27.0 million equivalent is
submitted for your approval. The loan would be repayable over 15 years,
including five years of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
It would help finance a project to promote the development and/or
restructuring of private manufacturing or service firms in the liberalized
non-hydrocarbon sectors, especially to enter and compete in export markets.
2.        Background.  Trinidad and Tobago's (T&T) economic policies during
the 1970.' oil boom favored inward-looking development. Real exchange rate
appreciation rendered agriculture and non-oil manufacturing uncompetitive.
The Government's industrial strategy focussed on development of energy-based,
heavy industries (steel, fertilizer, methanol) with state participation.
Other manufacturing aimed principally at import-substitution and was heavily
protected. Falling oil revenues combined with inappropriate policies caused
per capita GNP to decline from US$6,450 to US$3,350, and unemployment to rise
from 101 to 221 between 1982 and 1988. As the internal market contracted due
to the economic decline, many manufacturing firms cut operations, merged or
closed. Others, however, began to market offshore, mostly within CARICOM.
Owing to the decline in the domestic market and (later) policy shifts, non-oil
manufacturing exports grew rapidly from US$250 million to US$603 million
between 1980 and 1989. In 1990, the economy registered positive growth for
the first time since 1982, albeit at a low rate. Manufacturing value-added
totalled US$1.4 billion in 1989, accounting for 36X of GDP and 18Z of total
employment. Within manufacturing, petroleum and petrochemicals accounted for
741 of GDP and 27S of emrloyment. Food processing ranked second, followed by
chemicals and non-metallic minerals. Annual GDP growth is projected to reach
2.51 by 1993, remain at about 3.51 over the following three years, and average
4.3% during 1997-99. During this period, private investment is projected to
trend upwards.
3.        In 1987, the Government initiated a medium-term adjustment program
supported by IMF arrangements and Bank SAL and TAL operations. This program
enccmpassed policy adjustments aimed at improving incentives and
computitiveness in the non-oil economy, with a view to promoting its growth as
a source of employment and foreign exchange.  The SAL contains commitments
inter alia to: (i) remove most QRs for non-agricultural products in two stages
by end-1991, and to reduce maximum import charges to the CARICOM CET by the
end of 1994; and (ii) undertake studies of the agricultural protection system,
the impact of removal of QRs on domestic industries, and the role of duty
exemptions. As of November 1991, the Government had reduced QRs consistent
with the SAL agreemen..s and was pursuing the agreed studies.
4.        Owing to the recent reforms, policies governing the non-agriculture
real sectors increasingly favor growth of an efficient private sector. Legal
and administrative reforms affecting foreign investment, coupled with more
aggressive promotion, have enhanced prospects for firm entry and technology



and skills transfer. Exchange rate adjustment, trade reform, removal of price
controls, tax reform, and liberalization of foreign exchange availability have
improved incentives for efficient investment and begun to heighten incentives
to adopt new technology. Reform of export/import procedures under the TAL
should encourage trade-based production. Procedures governing company
formation do not materially impede firm entry. Labor regulations focus
generally on administrative and legal recourse against health and safety
dangers, employment of child labor, and funding of Social Security, and do not
materiall, affect wage determination or impede firm exit.
5.        Notwithstanding the above progress, strengthening of T&T industry's
capacity to sustainably access and compete in world markets will require that
the Government and private sector: (i) address such medium-term real-sector
issues as: (a) poor product and service quality and inadequate standards; (b)
development of internationally-recognized testing services; (c) delivery of
specialized services to emergent exporters to help overcome gaps in
information and expertise which currently make their entrance to extra-CARICOM
markets very difficult; (d) development of improved pollution standards and
environmental management procedures; (e) adoption of measures to privatize and
establish an appropriate framework for key existing industries like steel and
petrochemicals, and to attract foreign investment; and (f) the limited
liberalization of the policy framework for agriculture; and (ii) continue to
review and upgrade the adequacy of its foreign investment regime and
investment promotion efforts, with a view to enhancing the international
competitiveness and image of T&T as a place to invest. Such actions will
require that existing institutions for export development (EDC), technology
development (CARIRI), environmental review (T&CPD), and industrial standards
and quality control (TTBS) be strengthe%ed to provide better service,
especially to emergent and restructuring enterprises.
6.        In the financial sector, a FY91 Bank Review found that: (i) T&T's
financial sector was largely free of market distortions; (ii) interest rates
were market-determined and had generally been positive in real terms; (iii)
the financial system was reasonably competitive; and (iv) although the spread
betw3en the commercial bank prime lending rate and the six to twelve month
time deposit rate had increased to about seven percent in 1991, this was
primarily due to increased provisioning for loan losses, reflecting the
economic contraction. The Review, however, found that accounting and
disclosure requirements and the prudential criteria and enforcement powers of
the Inspector of Banks needed strengthening. Moreover, procedures to handle
banking crises have in the past tended to prolong, rather than resolve,
problems and needed to be improved. Other medium term issues affecting the
development of financial markets more generally which were identified by the
Bank Review included the need to: (i) improve the transparency of financial
markets; and (ii) update the regulatory frameworks for companies, the stock
and bond markets, and the insurance industry. The Government is aware of
these needs and is preparing legislative reforms aimed at: (i) strengthening
prudential regulations, bank supervision, accounting standards, and the
handling of ailing banks; and (ii) updating the regulatory frameworks for
companies, the stock and bond markets, and the insurance industry. The latter
reform relating to the bond market was undertaken following consultation with
the IFC.

7.        The project would help adLress the foregoing remaining real and
financial sector issues. The techrical assistance (TA) component would
support programs aimed at remedying the real sector problems mentioned under
items (i) (s)-(e) and (ii) in para. 5. Meanwhile, in the financial sector the
project would support a program of legal and regulatory actions to strengthen
the prudential framework and quality of bank supervision, and to improve
supervision of the insurance industry. Pending reforms to liberalize the
agricultural sector, which are being studied under the SAL, project credit
would not be made available for agricultural investments.
8.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  A key component of the Bank's
country strategy is to encourage growth of internationally-competitive non-oil
activities and promote financial sector reform. Real sector objectives are
being pursued at the macro level through support for trade and fiscal reforms
under ongoing Bank SAL and TAL operations. Financial sectcr objectives are
being pursued through dialogue resulting from the Bank's FY91 financial sector
Review, and selectively through technical assistance under the project. The
credit component of the project will provide an opportunitv to support
implementatior. of the most pressing required reforms. The Government has
sought the proposed project to draw upon the Bank's wider experience to help
T&T firms meet the challenges resulting from the macro reforms. The proposed
project has been designed taking into account major lessons for industrial
finance projects identified by OED. These include that: (i) the project is
being made in the context of a macro-economy which is emerging from a
successful stabilization program entailing policies to control the fiscal
deficit and liberalize the trade and incentive regimes. The continued
commitment of the proposed loan would be linked to maintenance of the agreed
trade reform measures and adequate interest rate policies; and (ii) the
Central Bank, which has capable career staff, will serve as the APEX
instittvtion to channel credit competitively through existing financial
institutions upon market terms. The project also reflects the current "best
practice" within the Bank concerning the design and focus of the TA
components, e.g. for export expansion.
9.        Prolect Objectives.  The project would promote development and/or
restructuring of private manufacturing or cervice firms (except primary
producers of oil, gas or agricultural or livestock products), especially to
enter and compete in export markets. Another key objective would be to
improve the safety and soundness of the financial system by strengthening the
supervision of financial intermediaries and the insurance industry. Ancillary
objectives would be to: (i) improve the technical standards used to assess the
environmental impact of public and private sector projects in T&T, and (ii)
strengthen the capacity of the Town and Country Planning Division (T&CPD) to
review Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).
10.       Proiect Descrintion.  The project would include components for
productive sector credit (812 of project costs) and technical assistance (TA)
(162 of project costs). The credit component would help finance investment
and working capital requirements in a broad range of productive activities in
any liberalized subsector, except primary production of oil and gas. Loan
funds would be onlent by the Government, through the Central Bank, to PFIs
upon terms to simulate PFIs' marginal cost of borrowing, viz: (i) the interest



- 4-
rate charged to PFIs for funds denominated in TT dollars would be the weighted
average of domestic six-month CD rates, adjusted upwards for the avoided cost
of reserve requirements; and (ii) the interest rate charged to PFIs for funds
denominated in US dollars would he six-month LIBOR + 1.5 percentage points.
Subloans to final beneficiaries would be evaluated in accordance with PFIs'
standard criteria; however, the Operating Policy Guidelines (OPG) for the
credit component would also require inter alia that suLprojects be screened
accordit.g to national environmental requirements. Subloans would be: (i)
denominated, at the option of PFIs and subborrowers, in local currency or US
dollars; and (ii) onlent upon market terms (which implicitly reflect foreign
exchange risks). The technical assistance would: (i) establish an Expor';
Technical Assistance Facility (ETAP) to assist private manufacturing and
service firms to enter extra-CARICOM markets. 'he ETAP would be modelled
after programs implemented under Bank projects elsewhere. By providing cost-
shared grants of strictly limited amounts, the ETAP would help nascent export
firms overcome information and expertise gaps encountered in their initial
attempts to enter export markets. The ETAP is also expected to provide
spillover benefits to other productive sector firms through a demonstration
effect, which would help develop an "exporting culture" in T&T. The ETAP
would be administered by the EDC, which is capably run along private sector
lines; (ii) enable TTBS and CARIRI to provide T&T industry with
internationally-recognized industrial standards, quality management,
metrology, and testing services, to enable T&T industry to gain or maintain
acce6a to important world markets; (iii) support development through T&CPD of
an improved set of environmental pollution control standards and mitigation
measures which would be adopted for use in screening public and private
investment projects within T&T, and strengthen T&CPD's capacity to review
EIAs; (iv) finance studies aimed at: (a) building the Governmernt's
understanding inter alia of the organizational and ownership options,
including privatization, to best encourage the growth and diversifi-ation of
the steel and petrochemical industries; and (b) reviewing the effectiveness of
T&T's new foreign investment regime and defining a foreign investment
promotion strategy; and (v) support the Ministry of Finance in implementing
medium-term regulatory reforms for the insurance industry. Terms of reference
for all studies would require that action programs be developed to implement
study recommendations.
11.       The loan is expected to take three years to commit and about seven
and one half years to disburse. The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$49.5 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$27.2
million (552). The project would be managed by the Restructuring Support Unit
(a unit in the Ministry of Planning and Mobilization capably administering the
TAL), in conjunction with the Central Bank (which is adequately staffed to act
as APEX for the credit component). A breakdown of the costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Trinidad and Tobago are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map and the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9818-TR, dated
November 22, 1')91, are also attached.

12.       Agreed Actions.   The Government has: (1) agreed to an indicative
timetable for processing, and the principles underlying, proposed legal and
regulatory ref arms for the financial system to which disbursement of the
credit component would be linked; ar.d (ii) outlined in a letter to the Bank
its strategy for business expansion and industrial restructuring, which
provides inter alia for the maintenance of trade policies conducive to the
development of a competitive private sector.
13.       The implementation of the proposed loan would be subject to the
following further actions:
(a)  As conditions of Effectiveness: (i) designation by the Government
of the Central Bank as its agent to implement the credit component under the
proposed project; (ii) signing of satisfactory agreements between the Borrower
and TTBS and CARIRI, (iii) designation of satisfactory Project Coordinators to
implement all project-supported activities for the respective beneficiary
institutions; and (hv) appointment by the EDC of two marketing officers, with
qualifications and experience satisfactory to the Bank, to promote the program
supported by the ETAF.
(b) As conditions of Disbursement of the credit component: (i) (a)
disbursement of the first US$7.5 million would be contingent upon satisfactory
progress by the Borrower in formulating proposals for the reform of its
financial system by strengthening its regulatory framework; (b) disbursement
of the remaining US$12.5 million would be contingent upon the Borrower
formally adopting such reforms and certifying that agreed new prudential
criteria are being applied system-wide; (ii) signing of satisfactory
Participation Agreements between the Central Bank and at least two eligible
PFIs; (iil) signing and furnishing to the Bank of satisfactory Participation
Agreements between the Central Bank and each PFI would be a condition of
Disbursement for Bank funds intermediated by the respective PFI; and (iv) the
PFIs are in compliance with agreed performance and eligibility criteria.
(c) As covenants in the Loan Agreament: (i) continued commitment of the
loan would be subject to the maintenance of the trade policy reform program
consistent with agreements under the SAL; (ii) the most current weighted
average CD rates and their range would be included among the statistics
published monthly by the Central Bank; (iii) at least annually, the Bank and
the Government would hold reviews of the adequacy of the relending interest
rates by the Central Bank to PEIs; (iv) at least annually, the adequacy of the
Operating Guidelines for the ETAF would be reviewed by the Bank and the
Government; (v) TA programs would be carried out in the context of agreed
Performance Plans for TTBS and CARIRI; and (vi) the Bank and the Government
would carry out a review of progress in implementing all aspects of the
project between eighteen and twenty four months following loan Effectiveness,
to take stock of accomplishments and introduce agreed corrective measures,
whei. warranted, on the basis of implementation experience gained to date.



- 6 -
(d) As dated covenants in the Loa% MAreement: (i) by September 30, 1992,
the Government will submit to Parliaments (a) amendments to the Standards Act
to facilitate the adoption of international product and service standards; and
(b) proposed legislation for the adoption of the International System of Units
to regulate weights and measures; and (ii) by June 30, 1995, the Government
would adopt, as national environmental standards, the environmental pollution
control standards developed by T&CPD through the TA component.
14.       Benefits.  TA activities would help develop internationally-
competitive productive activities and support the t ?ansition from
stabilization to growth in the economy.  The improvtd framework of prudent4.l
regulation and supervision which the project would encourage would help
improve the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Funds provided
under the credit component would assure availability of resources for firm
reorientation andlor expansion. Improved environmental standards and ETA
review procedures would enhance national environmental management.
15.       Risks.  Main risks are that: (i) policy backtracking could result
in diminished incentives for export-led economic diversification; (it) lengthy
contracting procedures could delay TA activities; and (iii) delays in
implementing satisfactory banking regulations could occur. These risks are
being handled by: (i) conditioning the loan on maintenance of adequate
policies; (ii) paying special attention to contracting arransements during
project preparation; and (iii) linking disbursement of the credit component to
actions on banking regulations and adoption of specific eligibility criteria
to screen PFIs; the substence of the regulatory reforms and the eligibility
criteria have both been agreed.
16.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
