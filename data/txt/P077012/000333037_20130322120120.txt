    Note: This report presents revised estimates of the KALAHI-CIDSS impacts on household welfare,
    access to services, social capital and local governance. Earlier estimates were reported in a report
    prepared by Asia Pacic Policy Center (2011) and summarized in World Bank (2011a). The original
    estimates of APPC were revised as an error was made in generating the results.

               Virgie Niebres is a 36-year-old resident of Rawis. She began studying nursing at Bicol
               University, but due to poverty was forced to stop schooling after only her first semester.
               Her husband is 37 and an elementary graduate. Together they have five children. Before
               the KALAHI-CIDSS project, their only source of income was from harvesting copra.

               The KALAHI-CIDSS road project in Rawis has created the opportunity for Virgie to improve
               and diversify her family’s livelihoods options. With a more efficient way to transport copra
               to market, they were also able to purchase a motorcycle operated by her husband for
               “habal-habal? (motorcycle rental).

               Vergie also has benefited directly by working closely with KALAHI-CIDSS as project prep-
               aration team chairman and as a bookkeeper. She was then elected as the chair of the Ba-
               rangay Subproject Management Committee (BSPMC). During project preparation, Virgie
               learned how to develop project proposals, and assisted with mapping impoverished re-
               gions. Her experience as a BSPMC chair also taught her various aspects of project imple-
               mentation. She was able to overcome her shyness and enhance her public relations skills
               because she had to convince people in the barangay to attend barangay assemblies. She
               also gained the confidence to talk in front of a large crowd. Because of KALAHI, she learned
               to participate in barangay affairs. Being a volunteer also allowed her to attend numerous
               training events and seminars. She has traveled not only within the municipality, but even
               in other provinces. These experiences resulted in a new career for her as center chief of
               Simbag sa Pag-asenso, a Catholic social action lending microfinance program.

               As center chief, Vergie handles 52 members from four barangays. She is also the Secre-
               tary of the Barangay Power Association, a local electrification association in charge of the
               maintenance of the barangay’s electrification. The association’s activities include the col-
               lection of payments from each household. She also became the manager of the distribu-
               tion of fertilizers and seedlings provided by the Department of Agriculture in the munici-
               pality. She also takes part in the decision making in the barangay.

Notes: Results from OLS (Column 1) and xed-eects (Columns 2-6) regressions. The dependent variable is
a dummy equal to one if the household has access to either level II or level II water supply. In Panels A and
B, the sample is restricted to households that are observed three times. In Panels C and D the full sample
is used. In Panels B and D sample weights are used. The standard errors (in parentheses) (resp. [brackets])
account for potential correlation within municipality (resp. within village). * denotes signicance at the 10
percent, ** at the 5 percent and, *** at the 1 percent level.

restricted to households that are observed three times. In Panels C and D the full sample is used. In Panels
B and D sample weights are used. The standard errors (in parentheses) (resp. [brackets]) account for po-

Notes: Results from OLS (Column 1) and xed-eects (Columns 2-6) regressions. The dependent variable
is a dummy equal to one if the respondent trusts strangers. In Panels A and B, the sample is restricted to
households that are observed three times. In Panels C and D the full sample is used. In Panels B and D
sample weights are used. The standard errors (in parentheses) (resp. [brackets]) account for potential cor-
relation within municipality (resp. within village). * denotes signicance at the 10 percent, ** at the 5 percent
and, *** at the 1 percent level.

dummy equal to one if the respondent knows the village budget. In Panels A and B, the sample is restricted
to households that are observed three times. In Panels C and D the full sample is used. In Panels B and D
sample weights are used. The standard errors (in parentheses) (resp. [brackets]) account for potential cor-
relation within municipality (resp. within village). * denotes signicance at the 10 percent, ** at the 5 percent

capita non-food consumption (PHP 1,000) in Panel C and, the log per capita non-food consumption in
Panel D. The standard errors (in parentheses) account for potential correlation within municipality. All re-
gressions include time-trends. * denotes signicance at the 10 percent, ** at the 5 percent and, *** at the 1
percent level.

             set index in Panel A and a dummy equal to one if the household has access to electricity in Panel B. The
             standard errors (in parentheses) account for potential correlation within municipality. All regressions include
             time-trends. * denotes signicance at the 10 percent, ** at the 5 percent and, ***at the 1 percent level.
