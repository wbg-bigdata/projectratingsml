collective illness; and (iii) improve the stewardship role and appropriate regulatory environment
of the Nation's public health system. The Project aims to support Argentina's Federal Health Plan
and its objectives to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with collective illness.

H. Restructuring
The first Project restructuring was on April 28, 2008 to: (i) account for a new pricing policy
approved by the Bank's Executive Directors on September 27, 2007, and (ii) to request the
capitalization of the Front-end Fee with a portion of the proceeds from disbursement Category
(5) (Avian Influenza Pandemic Action Plan and Health Emergency and/or Natural Disasters
Preparedness Action Plan).
The Project had a second restructuring on September 2, 2011 to: (i) to modify three PDO
indicators; (ii) to reallocate Loan proceeds and (iii) to extend the Project closing date by 12
months from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design
1.1     Context at Appraisal

2.     The economic crisis of 2001 in Argentina threatened the effectiveness of public health
programs that had, up to then, generated better health outcomes than the average for Latin
America. The crisis doubled the share of the population under poverty, increasing the proportion
that came to depend on public health services to 45 percent. The crisis exposed and exacerbated
the health sector’s inefficiencies and weakened the stewardship function of National Ministry of
Health (Ministerio de Salud de la Nación - MSN). Years of underinvestment in public health prior
to the crisis had greatly deteriorated the Government of Argentina’s (GOA) ability to sustain
improvements in health outcomes.

3.      The division of labor between the provincial and federal level was at the core of the
system’s fragmentation. Although the MSN executes only three percent of total health spending
and has limited legal and administrative influence over Provincial Ministries of Health (Ministerio
de Salud de la Provincia – MSPs), it has a key role in the coordination and stewardship of the
sector. Provinces manage most health sector responsibilities, including operational and provincial
policy matters. But the weakened stewardship of MSN reduced its ability to coordinate the sector
and improve its efficiency. The crisis increased the urgency to strengthen the regulation and
stewardship of essential public health functions and programs (EPHFP).

4.       The strengthening of the Federal Health Council (Consejo Federal de Salud -
COFESA) marked the beginning of improved coordination and led to the development of the
Federal Health Plan (FHP) for 2004-2007. The FHP’s overall objective was to increase the
effectiveness of public subsidies to improve the health status of the poor. Specifically, FHP sought
to: (i) increase access of the poorest mothers and children to basic services; (ii) enable the MSN to
reassume its stewardship and regulatory functions in core areas of public health; (iii) consolidate
regulatory reforms in the social health insurance system to prevent negative spillovers in the
public health sector in the provision of access to services for the poor and uninsured; and (iv)
trigger significant changes in the relationship between the national and provincial governments, as
well as between the provinces and health service providers.

5.      The World Bank has partnered with the GOA to support the FHP through a series of
operations and technical assistance (TA). Although the Bank’s engagement in the health sector
in Argentina spans close to two decades, the dialogue with the GOA became re-energized with the
discussion of a sector assessment2 prepared by the Bank in 2003. The report identified two priority
areas: (i) strengthening of EPHFP and (ii) development of provincial health insurance programs.
Since the adoption of FHP, lending has focused on the expansion of Maternal and Child Health
Insurance Programs at the provincial level through the Provincial Maternal-Child Health
Adaptable Lending Program phases I and II (MCHIP I, Loan 7225-AR -P071025- and II, Loan
7409 -P095515-). This Project addresses the strengthening of EPHFP. Given the long-term
partnership between GOA and the Bank, and the considerable knowledge about the Argentine
health system and socio-economic and political reality that the Bank had accumulated, partnering

Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, Report No. 34015-AR, discussed by the Board on May 4,
2006) for 2006-2008: enhancing social equity and inclusion, and improving governance. The
Bank-GOA Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, Report No. 48476-AR, discussed by the Board on
June 9, 2009) for 2010-2012 maintained the same three pillars and thus the Project’s objectives
remain relevant with the CPS and GOA’s FHP.

1.2        Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7.      The Project Development Objectives are to: (i) increase the coverage of ten prioritized
Public Health Programs; (ii) reduce the population's exposure to principal risk factors associated
with collective illness; and (iii) improve the stewardship role and appropriate regulatory
environment of the Nation's public health system. The Project seeks to support Argentina's FHP
and its stated overall objective to reduce mortality and morbidity associated with collective illness3.

1.3        Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

8.      The PDOs remained valid and unchanged throughout the implementation of the
Project. Three of six key outcome indicators were modified through a restructuring approved
in September 2, 2011. The targets of two key indicators were modified to better reflect new
knowledge about factors affecting the two indicators, and a third was replaced with one in the
same area that had been more active due to the dengue epidemic.
 The indicator “prevalence of smoking has decreased by 6 percent among those aged 18-64?
    was modified to reflect a 6 percent decrease rather than a 6 percentage-point difference (i.e. a
    change from 33 percent to 31 percent), rather than from 33 percent to 27 percent. The
    amendment notes the target was wrongly expressed in the PAD.
 The indicator “increasing voluntary blood donations was modified from an increase by 50
    percent (from 6 percent to 9 percent) to “an increase to 30 percent? (from 6 to 30 percent).
 The indicator “certification of 17 of 19 provinces in the interruption of transmission of Chagas?
    was replaced by “the establishment of health situation rooms certified for surveillance of
    vector-borne diseases in 20 Provinces?. Given that important advances were made in the
    surveillance and control of vector-borne diseases (which also includes Chagas) in response to
    the dengue and H1N1 epidemics.

1.4        Main Beneficiaries
9.      The Project invests in health-related public goods, which have externalities that bring
benefits the Argentine population as a whole. While the Project does not specifically target the
poor, the Project invests in health-related public goods, and thus investments have externalities
that bring benefits to those not benefiting directly (e.g. immunizing all sectors of the population
benefits the poor even if 100 percent are not immunized). The unification of norms and quality
standards reduced inequalities among Provinces, as did the targeted focus on specific Public
Health Activities (PHAs) through the resource allocation mechanism.

    Collective illness is defined as illness that has public health implications.


                                                                2
1.5    Original Components

10.      The Project has four components (for further details, please see Annex 2).
11.     Component 1: Strengthen National Health Stewardship and Capacity to Carry out
EPHFs (US$ 61.6 million). The activities financed under this component seek to improve
capacity at the national and provincial levels to carry out the EPHF that are necessary for effective
delivery of priority public health programs (PPHPs). PPHPs include: Immunization, TB, AIDS,
vector-borne diseases, emerging diseases, safe blood supply, response to emergencies and
disasters, NCDs and their risk factors, border health, and reproductive health. Subcomponent 1A
finances activities at the National level (US$ 31.6 million) and includes: improvement of health
intelligence (including the strengthening of the public health laboratory network), strengthening
policy and planning capacity, strengthening regulatory environment PPHPs, introduction of
quality assurance mechanisms, and strengthening of health promotion. Subcomponent 1B
finances activities at the Provincial level (US$ 30.0 million), and includes: the development and
monitoring of minimum standards and accreditation mechanisms, the formulation and
implementation of annual performance agreements (APAs) between national and provincial levels
to implement EPHPFs.

12.    Component 2: Strengthen Inputs Management and Performance Monitoring of
PPHPs and Preparedness for Health Emergencies (US$ 110 million). Subcomponent 2A
(US$ 90 million) finances the centralized purchasing of medicines, vaccines and other medical
supplies (distributed to MSPs) needed by the PPHPs, and the design and installation of logistics
systems at the Provincial level to track utilization and distribution of medical supplies. Financing
under this component for the second and third years was conditioned on the number of Provinces
with functioning monitoring systems for nationally procured supplies. Subcomponent 2B
(US$ 20 million) provides support for the launching of a rapid health sector response in the event
of a health emergency or natural disaster (It was designed with an Avian Influenza epidemic in
mind). Funds not utilized during the first three years would be reallocated to subcomponent 2A.

13.     Component 3: Implement and Expand a Package of PPHPs at the Provincial Level
(US$ 40 million). Project funds would be disbursed to MSN who would refund the Provinces
according an output-based mechanism on the basis of their performance with respect to PHA
targets defined in agreed APAs. PHAs are forty-five standardized activities that have been
assigned a pre-defined unit cost for eligible operating costs (excluding salaries and medical
supplies). They include selected operational costs of delivering PPHPs, including public health
surveillance, disease control activities, monitoring of compliance with national norms including
training and supervisory activities, health promotion, communication, social participation, local
distribution of inputs (e.g. vaccines, condoms etc.) and regulation activities. Reported PHAs are
verified by an external concurrent auditor on a regular basis.

14.     Component 4: Management and governance of the EPHFPs (US$ 8.4 million).
Subcomponent 4A financed Project management (US$ 3.6 million) both nationally and at the
provincial level (through the Coordination Unit (CU), the Cluster of Management by Results
(CMR), MSPs, and the International Financing Unit for Health (UFI-S)). Consultants hired to
assist in the CMR in the implementation of the Project or their tasks, would be gradually
mainstreamed into MSN and Provincial cadres by the end of the Project. Subcomponent 4B
(US$ 4.8 million) financed a mid-term evaluation of indicators, an impact evaluation, the
contracting of a concurrent audit for project oversight of Component 3, the dissemination of

                                                 3
information on Project implementation, and increased civil society participation through voluntary
participation of providers signing transparency letters.

1.6    Revised Components

15.    Components were not revised.

1.7    Other significant changes

16.    The Loan Agreement (LA) was amended twice. The first amendment on April 28, 2008,
was to account for a new pricing policy approved by the Bank's Executive Directors on September
27, 2007, as the LA had been signed two months earlier; and to request the capitalization of the
Front-end Fee with a portion of the proceeds from disbursement Category (5) (Avian Influenza
Pandemic Action Plan and Health Emergency and/or Natural Disasters Preparedness Action Plan).
Thus, the Commitment Charge was deleted, the Front-end Fee was reduced from one percent to
one-quarter of one percent of the Loan amount, and Interest Waivers were eliminated and replaced
by the inclusion of Default Interest. Funds in the amount of $550,000 were reallocated from
Category 5 to Category 7 (Front-end Fee).

17.      The Project had a second restructuring on September 2, 2011 to: (i) to modify three PDO
indicators; (ii) to reallocate Loan proceeds and (iii) to extend the Project closing date by 12
months from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012. These changes were processed to: (i) give
the Project sufficient time to reach its objectives given delays in the declaration of effectiveness;
(ii) allow for the completion of the BSL2 and BSL3 national laboratories and blood bank works
underway under Category 1, which were facing higher prices; (iii) increase coverage of the
National Blood Safety, HIV/AIDS and Reproductive Health Programs under Category 2; (iv)
increase the amount of Operating Costs under Category 3, as the original amount was insufficient;
(v) reduce the amount under Category 4 (PHAs) that was not executed due to start-up
implementation delays, and would not be utilized due to the beginning of implementation of PHAs
through FESP II by January 2012; and (vi) reallocate the balance of the Project Preparation Fund
(PPF). An amount of US$121,267.00 was cancelled on December 10, 2010 under Category 2a due
to the declaration of misprocurement on November 5, 2010.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes
2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

18.     Key aspects of project design ensured its relevance. Project design was informed by a
detailed sector assessment carried out in 2003 and the GOA’s FHP. The Project’s objectives were
consistent with the 2006-2008 CAS (Report No. 34015-AR, discussed by the Board on May 4,
2006), and the 2010-2012 CPS (Report No. 48476-AR, discussed by the Board on June 9, 2009).
GOA’s commitment was very high, fueled by the need to continue to strengthen the sector, but
also because its views regarding the diagnosis and approach to address sector needs were aligned
with those of the Bank. The Project was an integral part of a set of nationwide sector reforms.

19.    Implementation readiness was good. Project preparation benefited from a Project
Preparation Facility (PPF) in the amount of US$1.6 million that allowed the GOA to finance the
necessary TA and preparatory studies. Although Project preparation took more than a year and a


                                                 4
half, with a pre-identification mission in March, 2005 and appraisal in October 2006, the time was
needed to develop the approaches and instruments introduced, many of which required intense
discussions and negotiations with numerous counterparts. By Project negotiations, draft umbrella
agreements (convenios marco) to be signed between MSN and MSPs outlining their roles and
responsibilities were prepared, as were model APAs to be agreed with MSPs. Detailed
implementation plans for the various EPHFPs, including the specification and costing of the PHAs,
were drafted. This involved considerable effort as it implied working with 21 groups (10 programs
and 11 functions) to reach consensus. In addition, details on the mechanism and algorithm to be
employed to calculate thresholds for financial allocations to be made to the Provinces were
defined, as were numerous Terms of Reference including those for the external technical audit,
key Project staff at both national and provincial levels, and Project financial audits. Finally, a
Quality Enhancement Review (QER) provided useful inputs to improve on the design.

20.     The design incorporated lessons learned from other operations and international
experience and some innovative features. Priority programs selected were those addressing
Argentina’s burden of disease. Five of the ten “best buys? identified in the Disease Control
Priorities in Developing Countries review are included in the Project. The resource allocation
algorithm mentioned above, that allocates funds on the basis of a Province’s deviation from the
national average on specific health outcomes, ensured a more equitable distribution. It also built
on successful initiatives introduced in both Brazil and Argentina, introducing incentives for
improved performance at the National level (linking disbursements to the installation and use of
medical input management and logistics systems), and at the Provincial level (linking federal
transfers to outputs and results thru APAs). As in MCHIP APL I, the inclusion of an independent
technical audit to verify results added further value.

21.     Although the Project was generally well prepared, there were some aspects that could
have been better addressed. Nine of eleven Project risks to PDO and achievement of component
results were assessed as modest, but half were underestimated. Two risks associated with
implementation capacity at both national and provincial levels were mostly mitigated by the
inclusion of technical assistance and training but initially posed an important challenge. And while
the risk of implementation during electoral periods was somewhat mitigated through the signing of
APAs and umbrella agreements in the Provinces, it did not mitigate risk at the National level. Loss
of priority of the Project during one administration slowed down implementation for a year. Both
procurement and financial management (FM) risks were assessed as modest, yet this was also not
the case. In addition, M&E arrangements had some important gaps (refer to Section 2.3).

22.     The design was very ambitious given the complex nature of the reforms proposed and
existing capacity. The high expectations are reflected in the high targets defined for many PDIs.
Working with 24 MSPs, with different socio-economic realities and capacity, and ensuring staff
from 21 vertical programs and functions reached consensus was a major challenge. Moreover,
several changes the Project sought to induce are difficult to attain in a span of only five years. The
complexity proved a special challenge where Provincial capacity was limited.

23.    A Quality Enhancement Assessment (QEA8) carried out in November 2008 rated the
Project design as Moderately Satisfactory. A Quality Assessment of the Lending Portfolio
(QALP-2) carried out in June 2010 rated it as Satisfactory. Both made comments related to
problems with the log frame and the risk assessment.



                                                  5
2.2    Implementation
24.     Project implementation suffered a number of early setbacks, due in part to its
complexity but more importantly because national and provincial elections resulted in
changes in administrations only three months (December 2007) after effectiveness was declared.
The changes essentially meant the Project team had to start from scratch both at the National and
Provincial level and had to work closely with the new team to ensure they fully understood all
aspects of the Project. In addition, the new MSN administration did not immediately perceive the
strategic nature of the Project, and “demoted? it from reporting to the Chief of Cabinet of the
Minister to a lower level. The lack of priority given to the Project during 2008 made it more
difficult to obtain buy-in from MSPs and the needed contributions from the National Programs.
25.     At the same time, the complexity of the Project and the novelty of some of the
approaches used posed important challenges for all. A field visit of March 2009 noted the
difficulties encountered in the implementation of PHAs, one of the strategic tools introduced by
the Project. Provincial programs were not used to registering outputs in such a systematic way or
to be held accountable for their delivery, and there were also problems in understanding the
resource allocation mechanism. MSPs faced a steep learning curve. The Bank suggested a separate
monitoring team should be set up for PHAs and the preparation of trimestral reports for closer
follow-up. These difficulties led to delays in implementation of Component 3.

26.    The accreditation tool for EPHFPs encountered difficulties in its conceptualization
because of its novelty. Although a focus on EPHFs had been promoted by PAHO for some time,
there was no consensus as to how to approach their measurement. The Bank held several
discussions with the Government team to move this forward in 2008. To pilot it, it was agreed to
focus on the instrument for one Program (Blood Safety), but by mid-2010, the team realized it was
too unwieldy and decided to drop it and work on a simpler tool. This led to delays in
implementation of Subcomponent 1B.
27.    Challenges were also noted with regards to the management of the Project during this
period. The Bank team noted that Provinces needed greater support, including greater presence of
the CU in the Provinces, and coordination with National and Provincial programs and between CU
and UFI-S needed to be strengthened. UFI-S, needed to reduce delays in the implementation of the
procurement plan. The Bank fiduciary team worked closely with CU and UFI-S to address these
weaknesses. Although risks of implementation capacity had been underestimated, both teams
mitigated them in an effective manner.

28.     Change came in mid-2009. Argentina faced a dengue epidemic in early 2009 that
infected close to 27,000 people. The role of both the GOA and the Bank teams during the
epidemic was instrumental in turning the Project around. The crisis triggered the Emergency
Subcomponent (2B), and it was an opportunity for the Bank, CU and UFI-S to work on the
simplification of processes allowing for more timely procurement, the establishment of a
revolving fund to provide more agile financing, and the preparation of new PHAs addressing
dengue directly. The rapidness and effectiveness of the response gave the Project the visibility it
needed to get greater buy-in from Provincial governments. The joint response to the epidemic
gave all sides an opportunity to work together and show what was feasible. As a result, more
MSPs opted to participate. Thus, by mid-2009, all but one Province had signed the umbrella
agreements.


                                                6
29.     A more supportive political environment, matured implementation, and proven
effectiveness gave the Project the impetus it needed. The implementation of PHAs and APAs
showed greater progress. The management of medical supplies under Subcomponent 2A was
expanded to 20 Provinces, and a web-based version was introduced. In response to the epidemics,
surveillance was strengthened, as was the capacity to respond to emergencies, leading to the
establishment of the Argentine Epidemiological Shield (AES) (Annex 2). Unutilized funds
resulting from implementation delays were reprogrammed to strengthen the AES4. Institutionally,
as a result of the response to the epidemic, the CU came to be seen more as support than as a
parallel Ministry. This improved planning and execution of Project activities.

30.    The mid-term review (MTR) took place in March 2011. There had been plans to carry
out the MTR in May 2009, but it was postponed to June 2010 due to the dengue and H1N1
epidemics, and then postponed again until March 2011 after the GOA requested the preparation of
FESP II (approved on December 20, 2010) and an A H1N1 project approved on February 23,
20105. While too late to address Project issues, lessons learned provided inputs to the design of
FESP II.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

31.     The log frame of the Project had some gaps, which were not addressed by project
restructuring. The Project has three PDOs, with two of them essentially measuring different
levels of the same overall objective. As a result, indicators selected to track project progress over-
represent some areas (immunization) to the detriment of others (stewardship). Regarding the third
PDO, other indicators to measure Project impacts could have been considered, i.e. efficiency of
the Medical Input Tracking System (Sistema de Seguimiento y Monitoreo de Insumos, SSMI,).
Problems with respect to the log frame were brought up in the Project’s QER, QEA8 and QALP-2.

32.    Monitoring arrangements proposed for Component 1 could have better tracked
component outputs, i.e. laboratories renovated or equipped the activities of Healthy
Municipalities, information systems established or improved. The PAD proposes surveillance
systems to monitor this Component, but these are being strengthened through the component to
improve the GOA’s monitoring of public health. It was their strengthening that needed to be
monitored.

33.     Although an impact evaluation for the Project was not designed within the first
semester of implementation as planned, an effort was made to carry out some evaluation
studies in 2012 of the effects of the Project (FESP treatment) on immunization coverage, blood
safety, and environmental safeguard activities. Because the evaluations were not designed early,
there were difficulties in obtaining the needed baselines.

34.  Solid monitoring instruments were developed to monitor Subcomponent 2A and
Component 3. The web-based SSMI introduced in Subcomponent 2A has improved the



4.
  A total of US$36.5 million was spent on vector-borne diseases and the AES, including the US$11.7 million spent
through Subcomponent 2B.

distribution and management of medical supplies. The system to track PHAs was effective, as was
the monitoring of APAs, including the Concurrent Audit. Regarding outputs of Component 1, this
review was unable to find consolidated information regarding progress in rehabilitation and
modernization of laboratories, or outputs related to health promotion, (e.g. regulations developed).

35.     M&E capacity in the CU was good overall, and Project activities were well monitored.
Progress reports were well prepared. Mid-term and end-of-project reports were comprehensive and
thoughtful. Use of data for management in the Provinces varies. Of the two Provinces visited one
was still having problems getting program managers to use the data for management although the
situation room is being used regularly.

2.4     Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

36.    The Project has successfully managed activities addressing Indigenous Peoples (OP
4.10) and environmental (OP 4.01) safeguards. In particular, performance with respect to
the environmental safeguards was highly satisfactory.

37.     An Indigenous Peoples Framework was prepared in consultation with the Indigenous
Participation Council of the National Institute for Indigenous Affairs. All Provinces with
indigenous populations6 except La Pampa prepared an Indigenous People’s Plan (IPP). They were
prepared in a participative approach that involved carrying out a social evaluation using available
information. Social evaluations were carried out in 2007; and the IPPs, the following year. The
Project team worked closely with the Provinces to prepare the plans, including holding several
workshops, providing materials in the local languages. IPPs contained activities designed to make
the delivery of PPHPs more culturally relevant and sensitive.

38.    IPPs were financed through regular PHAs. When feasible, they would also be
financed through annual operational plans (i.e. when they could be financed centrally). Some
Provinces had greater participation, like Jujuy where several health promoters belong to
indigenous groups.

39.     The Project was classified as a Category B with regard to environmental issues
because of the procurement of medical supplies (raising concerns regarding health care waste
management (HCWM)) and the construction and renovation of laboratories. An Environmental
Assessment Plan Framework and Environmental Action Plan were prepared to address these
issues. These activities were carried out by the Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable
Development until 2011, when responsibility was transferred to MSN.

40.     Implementation of the Environmental Safeguard activities was highly satisfactory.
Initial environmental assessments were carried out in the four laboratories of the National
Administration of Laboratories and Health Institutes (Administración Nacional de Laboratorios e
Institutos de Salud, ANLIS) that would be upgraded through the Project. Action plans were
developed and training provided on HCWM in these laboratories, and field visits were made to
assess if initial recommendations were being followed.

41.     Improvement of HCWM in existing hospitals began with six hospitals, expanding to
30 by 2012. Diagnoses of HCWM were carried out. Each hospital created HCWM committees.
Training, guidelines and supplies were provided to each, and all were actively supervised. Annual
evaluations of the adequacy of HCWM were carried out in all participating hospitals from 2010 to
2012. The evaluation was done through observation in situ and through the review of
documentation. Results show a marked improvement each year. Proper segregation of waste has
resulted in some economic benefits as less waste is produced.

42.     Financial management (FM) and procurement for the Project were under the
responsibility of the UFI-S, which managed these functions for all multilaterally funded
projects in the health sector.

43.    The FM capacity assessment rated FM arrangements as acceptable and the Project
control framework as adequate. The FM risk for the Project was assessed as modest. None of
the specific risks identified were substantial. The capacity assessment was based on the
assessment for MCHIP APL II (in November 2006), a review of the annual financial audit issued
by Argentina Supreme Audit Institution (Auditoría General de la Nación, AGN), and visits to the
UFI-S and some of the participating Provinces.

44.     UFI-S’ procurement performance was assessed as average in the Fiduciary
Performance Assessment, based on the MCHIP APL II assessment and on the results of two
recent procurement ex-post reviews and external audits. The reports identified some common
deficiencies present in other projects in Argentina, no serious deviations.

45.    Despite a clean bill of health at appraisal, the first audit report (for 2007), submitted
four months late, gave a qualified opinion regarding the Sources and Uses of Funds Statement
and the Designated Account, and it noted significant internal control weaknesses. At issue was the
handling of a special revolving fund used to finance training.

46.     Audit reviews for 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 continued to identify internal control
issues in FM and issued qualified opinions with regards to Statements of Sources and Uses of
Funds. None of the observations regarding internal controls were serious, but they reflected
continuing poor quality control of FM. Throughout implementation there were delays in the
submission of Interim Unaudited Financial Reports (IUFRs) and annual audit reports.

47.    The 2008 audit also identified several internal control issues on procurement related
to the management of the bidding cycle and contract management. Several of these had
already been identified in a procurement ex-post review carried out by the Bank in February to
April 2008. A subsequent review carried out by the Bank found there was sufficient evidence of
misprocurement in the awarding of some contracts between 2005 and 2007. This conclusion was
communicated to GOA on November 5, 2010, and the Bank proceeded to cancel an amount of
USD 121,267.00 from the Loan.

48.     Based on the findings of the 2008 ex-post review, the GOA and the Bank prepared a
Procurement Action Plan that evolved into a Governance and Anti-corruption Action Plan
(GAAP). The GAAP was implemented for all health sector projects under UFI-S.
Recommendations were made to enhance UFI-S’ and CU’s operational processes to strengthen
internal controls. Improvements in fiduciary management began to be noted in 2011 through the


                                                9
close supervision of GAAP, and further improvements were noted in 2012, when GAAP
implementation was assessed as satisfactory by the Bank’s Latin America Governance team that
presented the GAAP for the Argentina health sector as a “best practice? fiduciary tool in the Bank.
49.    Deficiencies in the management of procurement led to significant delays in the
procurement of civil works and equipment. Of the planned construction/upgrading of three
National laboratories, only two were completed. A third construction (the Blood Bank at Garrahan
Hospital) was added. None of the 12 provincial laboratories or 12 regional laboratories for Buenos
Aires were constructed. Only one (the Dr. Malbrán Infectious Diseases Laboratory) was
completed by Project closing.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

50.     A follow-on operation, the Essential Public Health Functions and Programs II Project
(FESP II, Ln. 7412-AR), in the amount of US$461 million, was approved by the World
Bank’s Board of Directors on December 20, 2010. The five-year project was to be implemented
under the same arrangements. It has two PDOs: (i) improve the stewardship role of the federal
public health system, through the strengthening of the EPHFs, and (ii) increase the coverage and
clinical governance of PPHPs. FESP II expands on the mechanisms introduced under FESP I,
using results-based financing but turning its focus to NCDs and clinical governance of programs.
It employs the same governance framework and PHAs. Support for reproductive health, border
health and emergencies and disasters were dropped to accommodate greater focus on NCDs, but
support for CDs included in FESP I remains.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
51.     The objectives, design and implementation remain highly relevant. The Project’s
objectives were consistent with the CPS 2010-2012 (Report No. 48476-AR, discussed by the
Board on June 9, 2009), and continue to be consistent with GOA’s FHP, and as such, continue to
be highly relevant. Its design and implementation were sufficiently relevant to Argentina’s sector
priorities that the GOA requested a second operation (FESP II) to further expand the reforms
introduced.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives
52.     The Project has three PDOs, and 18 indicators (including six key indicators) to track
project progress. Additional data were included when available. Project indicators and their
targets and values by year are included Table 2 in Annex 2.
53.     PDO 1, to increase the coverage of ten prioritized public health programs, was
partially achieved. Increased coverage was measured by changes in coverage of key vaccines for
infants (indicator 7) and of TB Directly Observed Treatment Short course (DOTS) (indicator 9),
and an expansion of the Health Municipalities Network (indicator 10) and voluntary blood
donations.

54.    Indicator 7, “All provinces have 95 percent immunization coverage for children under 12



                                                10
months of age for BCG, DPT37, HiB, MMR and HepB?, was not achieved (Tables 1 and 2 in
Annex 2). Coverage (as measured by the indicator) was actually lower in 2010 and 2011 than in
2007 for all vaccines. Only 10 Provinces had over 95 percent coverage of Pentavalent vaccine.
BCG (anti-Tuberculosis vaccine) had the greatest coverage, with 19 provinces reaching 95 percent
coverage. However, it was the same coverage as in 2007.

55.     Looking at total coverage 8 , which masks individual Provinces’ coverage demonstrates
Project impact on increased coverage, but even in this case, achievement is partial. It shows that
coverage for all vaccines increased between 2007 and 2011, and that the increase was greater in
the case of vaccines for 6 year olds, the focus of PHAs. Utilizing this measure, only MMR and
BCG for infants met the target.

56.    The Expanded Immunization Program (Programa Ampliado de Inmunización, PAI) impact
evaluation study noted significant positive Project effects for most vaccines9 but, immunization
coverage of individual Provinces did not increase as much as expected.

57.     Indicator 9, coverage of TB DOTS “85 percent of new sputum-positive cases are receiving
DOTS?, was achieved. Coverage increased gradually throughout implementation from 58 percent
to 95 percent. Data on PHAs shows DOTS treatment activities (including both new and existing
patients) have increased from 980 in 2007 to 6,638 in 2011. Despite Argentina’s lower incidence
relative to its neighbors in the region, it has a higher case detection rate than Bolivia and Paraguay,
and the same as Brazil who has twice the incidence10.

58.   Indicator 10, “At least 750 Municipalities are members of the healthy municipalities’
network, and 400 are accredited as full members?, was achieved, as the network grew from 182
members to 854 from 2007 to 2011.

59.     Total blood donations11 increased from about 454,000 in 2007 to about 617,000 in 2011,
while the proportion that were voluntary also increased. Coverage of Chagas fumigation
(indicator 17) increased insufficiently as per its target. Information on the coverage of the
HIV/AIDS program or the reproductive health program was not collected.

60.     PDO 2, to reduce the population’s exposure to principal risk factors associated with
collective illness, was achieved, as the four key indicators achieved their targets. In addition,
three of the four indicators had effects that can be fully attributed to the Project.

61.     Measles and Congenital Rubella cases (indicators 1 and 2) were kept at zero, due to high
levels of coverage of the Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccine and effective surveillance
and management of reported cases (indicator 8). Coverage of MMR (first dose) among infants (0



7
  DPT immunization for children under 12 months was replaced in 2008 by the Pentavalent vaccine which includes
immunization against diptheria, pertussis, tetanus (DPT), hepatitis B (Hep B) and Haemophilus influenza type b (HiB)
virus. Thus coverage for these 3 is the same in the table.
8
   Coverage is based on doses applied, not persons vaccinated and thus may overstate actual coverage. Thus,
sometimes coverage is reported as being greater than 100 percent.

   Not a Project indicator


                                                        11
to 1 year olds) was already quite high in 2007 at 91 percent (data from the PAI impact evaluation),
increasing to 95 percent in 2010. Coverage of the second dose of MMR (among 6 and 11 year
olds) was lower, at 86 percent in 2007 increasing to 91 percent in 2010. This is higher than the 85
percent required for population immunity.

62.     Prevalence of smoking (indicator 3) declined from 33 percent to 30 percent, meeting its
target, but it is unclear what proportion of the change can be attributed to the Project12. During the
same period exposure to secondary smoke was reduced from 52 percent to 40.4 percent. Through
the Project, “free of smoke? areas were established, Healthy Municipalities Network promoted
local regulations restricting smoking, warning labels were placed on cigarette packs, training on
smoking cessation for health sector staff was provided, a hotline for information to quit smoking
was installed, research was conducted to better define intervention areas, and numerous
dissemination workshops were held. However, most were carried out after the risk factor survey
was conducted in 2009. By mid-2009, only 307 public spaces had been certified as “free of smoke
areas?, an insufficient amount given the geographic spread of Argentina. The effects of these
actions will be visible in the next risk factor survey.

63.     There was a significant increase in voluntary blood donations (indicator 5), from six
percent in 2006 to 30 percent in 2011, an achievement clearly attributed to the Project. As a result,
transfusion-transmitted infections declined from 10.5 percent in 2007 to 6.5 percent by 2011, a
clear expression of reduced risk. PHAs financed collection of blood from regular donors, training
of health promoters, and incorporation of firms willing to become “friends of voluntary blood
donation?. The number of blood collectors (indicator 18) increased from 278 in 2007 to 779 in
2011. Risk was also reduced through a reorganization of the Blood Safety Program by
consolidating blood banks to improve quality. The Project financed the construction of a Regional
Blood Bank, the organization of 20 Central Blood banks while eliminating close to half (from 299
to 172) of all hospital-based blood banks, and procured reagents to screen blood.

64.     Although not included as an indicator, the Project contributed to reduce mortality from
dengue outbreaks. Close to 27,000 people were infected in the dengue outbreak in early 2009. Five
people died. Improvements in surveillance and rapid response led to a 96 percent reduction in
cases (to 1280) and no deaths in 2010 and to 322 cases and zero deaths in 2011, and 272 in 2012
and zero deaths. Meanwhile neighboring countries were experiencing outbreaks, sometimes
greater than in 2009. While the Project also contributed to reduce the impact of H1N1 influenza,
most of the effects were through the H1N1 Project.

65.     PDO 3, to improve the stewardship role and appropriate regulatory environment of
the Nation's public health system, was achieved. To strengthen stewardship and governance, the
Project sought to strengthen and expand health intelligence; standardize norms, and protocols, and
establish an accreditation system for EPHFPs for Provinces; establish information systems to
improve efficiency and transparency while strengthening the link between Provincial and National
programs; and improving efficiency and effectiveness of the sector by introducing results-based
management (APAs and PHAs). It also sought to strengthen the sector’s ability to respond to

  GOA created the National Program for Tobacco Control in 2003 and has, since then, promoted the establishment of
smoke-free areas, campaigns to reduce smoking, and a number of other initiatives, some of which were financed
through Vigi-A.


                                                       12
health emergencies, relying on an improved surveillance and laboratory network, and strengthened
coordination between National and Provincial levels.
66.     There are two key indicators included for this PDO: (i) “Twenty Provinces have certified
situation rooms for vector-borne diseases? (indicator 4) and (ii) “Twenty Provinces are accredited
for public health functions and programs developed with minimum standards and norms for all 10
prioritized programs? (indicator 6).

67.     Twenty-one Provinces had certified rooms for vector-borne diseases, and thus this
indicator was achieved. The dengue epidemic and H1N1 pandemic renewed the need for
functioning situation rooms. Some situation rooms had been set up under the Vigi-A Project but
fell into disuse. These were upgraded through the H1N1 Project. FESP I later financed their
certification for vector-borne diseases. All but two Provinces have been certified under the Project.

68.     Twenty-two Provinces were assessed as the initial step for accreditation for EPHFPs, but
are not yet accredited. Thus this indicator is only partially achieved. An instrument developed to
accredit Provinces was applied in 22 Provinces in 2011. This provided an initial diagnosis of the
status of Provinces regarding their compliance with norms and protocols for EPHFPs. In order to
become accredited, they would have had to address gaps identified in the first application of the
tool developed that proved very useful to assess Provincial capacity to address EPHFPs and is
being implemented fully through FESP II.

69.     In addition, there were several tools introduced through the Project that are having
irreversible strengthening effects on the governance and stewardship of the sector. One of the most
important contributions to PDO 3 was the implementation of the APAs and PHAs. Their
implementation forced vertical programs to work in an integrated manner at both National and
Provincial levels. Implementing PHAs, based on National program protocols, unified and
homogenized the implementation of service delivery. At the local level, the application of PHAs
forced programs to better organize their activities and to improve the reporting of service delivery
outputs by systematizing the information and improving its accuracy. It focused them on results.
Having a third party evaluation of PHAs produced increased accountability of reporting. The
algorithm developed to allocate funds to programs served as a signal to Provincial authorities as to
what programs needed to be prioritized. Close to 70 percent of APAs met their commitments
substantially (indicator 12).

70.     Data on the effects of the application of PHAs on productivity are mixed, probably because
of their recent introduction. A comparison of the increase in coverage of vaccines applied to six
year olds (the subject of PHAs) and those applied to infants show greater increase among 6 year
olds over the lifetime of the Project. An impact evaluation carried out of the PAI, which adjusts
for exposure to PHAs, found that the effects of PHAs on vaccine coverage are positive, but are
only significant for MMR.

71.     The Project introduced and expanded several monitoring and surveillance systems that
have likely improved efficiency. The installation of the SSMI in all Provinces probably reduced
wastage, allowed for a more efficient allocation, and improved delivery times of supplies,
particularly after 2010 when the web-based system was introduced. Case-management software
was introduced in the HIV/AIDS program in the last year of the project for better patient follow-
up and better management of high cost medications. A database consolidating information on


                                                 13
health sector resources, including health facilities and human resources, Integrated Health
Information System of Argentina (Sistema Integrado de Información Sanitaria Argentino, SIISA)
to better regulate health resources was developed and was integrated to the SSMI.

72.     The Project strengthened the sector’s capacity to monitor public health and respond to
health emergencies by strengthening both surveillance and the laboratory network. The National
Health Surveillance System (Sistema Nacional de Vigilancia de la Información de Salud Pública,
SNVS) was expanded, and the quality of the sites improved. A decision was made in 2009 to
change focus from further expansion of sites to improving their quality. Part of this effort included
the certification of situation rooms for vector-borne diseases. The laboratory network was
strengthened through the improvement in the Laboratory-based Surveillance System (Sistema de
Vigilancia por Laboratorios, SIVILA). Surveillance systems were integrated, a laboratory quality
control system was established, and epidemiological training was provided. The establishment of
the AES gave greater institutional support and integration to the control of vector-borne diseases.
Besides improving the quality of information and response times, these systems built a stronger
link between the National and Provincial levels, and have significantly increased capacity for
evidence-based policy-making and implementation. These systems, together with the design of its
Emergency Contingency component allowed GOA to be very effective in addressing the dengue
epidemic.

3.3      Efficiency

73.     Changes in efficiency were assessed in three programs, all indicating improved
efficiency of use of resources due to Project inputs. The Project contributed to the
improvement of results with fewer resources through the implementation of the SSMI for PAI,
Blood Safety, TB and HIV. The HIV monitoring system for patients increased the efficiency of
prescription and delivery of antiretroviral treatment, as well as patient follow-up. In the case of
Blood Safety, the centralization of blood banks led to a major scaling up of plasma production and
reduction of supplies costs and infection rates. (Annex 3).

3.4      Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

1.     The overall Project outcomes are rated as Satisfactory, given that the objectives remain
highly relevant, the relevance of design and implementation are rated as substantial, the
achievement of PDOs and outcome indicators is high and that it contributed to a more efficient use
of resources related with activities and outputs.

3.5      Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
      a) Institutional Change/Strengthening. The SSMI developed for Subcomponent 2A is being
         adopted by other programs not included in the Project.
      b) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative). Both the approach to
         environmental safeguards and the indigenous peoples safeguard adopted by the Project
         were so successful that they are being adopted by other projects. The GAAP developed
         under the Project has been featured as one of the “best practices? included in the Bank’s
         “In Action on the Ground with Financial Management and Procurement? prepared for the
         2012 Fiduciary Forum. The design of the Emergency Preparedness component has been
         incorporated in projects in other countries in the Region (Dominican Republic and El


                                                 14
       Salvador). In addition, the Project has been recently selected as one of the transformational
       initiatives to be included in the Bank’s Strategy paper for Change Management.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
74.    The two risks to the development outcome are political and financial, and the risk is
assessed as moderate. The political risk is associated to the reforms initiated by the Project,
which need to be sustained over time in order to become institutionalized, as a change in
administration could reverse gains particularly where not well entrenched. FESP II is expanding
some of those reforms and thus will reduce the risk that Project achievements will not be
maintained.

75.    The second risk to development outcome has to do with the financial sustainability of
continuing the deepening of reforms in lagging Provinces once FESP II is completed. The
PAD had estimated about 30 staff centrally and 48 in the Provinces would be required to
implement the Project. Staff or their tasks were to be gradually mainstreamed into MSN and
MSPs. As per the PAD, the Project was to have on board only 23 staff at CU and 24 in the
Provinces by end of 2009. The reality was quite different. From 2010 to 2011, the number of staff
financed by the Project jumped from 68 to 160, climbing to 162 at Project closing. This does not
include the 636 consultancies that were financed during the last two years of implementation. As
many as 152 staff are currently being financed under FESP II. Under FESP II, the MSN was asked
to prepare an Action Plan to reduce the number of staff and consultants financed by the Project.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
5.1    Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

76.    Quality at Entry is assessed as Satisfactory. As noted in Section 2.1, project design was
based on detailed sector analysis and was in line with the GOA’s FHP and the CAS. Project
design incorporated lessons learned from other operations and international experience, and it
introduced several innovative approaches. Implementation readiness was good. Although M&E
arrangements had some gaps and some risks were underestimated, particularly given the
complexity of the Project, Quality at Entry is assessed as Satisfactory because: (i) the gaps in
M&E did not affect the implementation; (ii) the risk of electoral periods was beyond the control of
the Project, and (iii) the risk of uneven implementation capacity was partially mitigated. Thus, the
shortcomings are assessed as minor. A QEA8 assessment rated it as Moderately Satisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision

77.    The team supervising the Project was the same team involved in preparation and
remained on board through the duration of the project, providing continuity. The fact that
some of the technical staff were based in Argentina greatly enhanced dialogue, provided
continuous support, and allowed for a more swift resolution of problems when they emerged.



                                                15
78.     The team was proactive in addressing unforeseen challenges and bottlenecks. Faced
with a totally new implementation team after elections of 2007, the Bank team had to transfer its
knowledge to the new Government team and instill ownership. The same effort had to be made in
Provinces where authorities changed. The team was very proactive in ensuring appropriate
implementation of innovative approaches and resolving bottlenecks. PHA implementation was
closely followed-up, particularly in the beginning. The Bank recommended PHAs be assigned a
dedicated monitoring team and requested trimestral progress reports. All details of the Emergency
Component had been ironed out before it was triggered. One area that could have received
additional technical support was the development of the accreditation tool.

79.     Project management and fiduciary challenges were met in a timely and effective
manner. Having a country-based fiduciary team that worked together closely increased the
effectiveness of its support. It developed and closely supervised the GAAP, leading to
improvements in FM and Procurement. Problems in Project management were flagged early, and
solutions were agreed with Government. Safeguards (environmental and indigenous peoples) were
also adequately supervised.

80.     The Project was intensively supervised. Missions were frequent, averaging four per year,
and generally lasted a week. Several two-day technical visits were made to follow-up on specific
issues. Aide memoires were informative. Few field visits were recorded in Project aide memoires
or other Project documents. Trimestral reviews of Project activities by program and of IUFRs
were carried out. The Project’s MTR took place during the final stage of implementation. It led to
a level two restructuring.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
81.    Given there were only minor shortcomings in Project preparation and
implementation, the overall rating for Bank performance is Satisfactory. A QSA rated project
supervision as Satisfactory.

5.2    Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

82.    Government performance is rated as Satisfactory. The Ministry of Economy and Public
Finance gave its full support to the Project. Financing for the Project was timely and sufficient.
Existing bureaucratic processes resulted in a delayed request for the loan (it was received March
2006 when the first preparation mission was in March 2005) and in delayed effectiveness due to
delays in the signing of a Presidential Decree. The Project was audited by AGN. Audit reports
were of good quality although often submitted late. None of these issues affected implementation.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
83.    The performance rating for Implementing Agencies is rated Satisfactory as three
(MSN, MSPs and CU, including Province-based staff) of the four implementers had satisfactory
performance. Performance of the fourth (UFI-S) was rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

84.     MSN and MSPs performance is rated as satisfactory. With the exception of a 12-month
period following a change in administration in 2008, MSN has given its full support to the Project.


                                                16
MSN’s commitment has been instrumental in encouraging MSPs to participate. Commitment by
MSPs varies, but changes in administration in several Provinces have not seriously affected
implementation. In addition MSPs that have seen the changes brought on by the Project have
become FESP champions. MSN assigned a solid team to the Project both during preparation and
implementation. Preparation was arduous due to the multiplicity of MSN players that needed to
reach consensus, but commitment to the changes introduced never wavered. While there was
insufficient internal coordination between MSN Programs and between National and Provincial
Programs in the beginning, joint programming is now the norm.

85.      The performance of the CU (including Provincial staff) is rated as Satisfactory. The
CU was well staffed with a capable, collaborative multi-sectoral team. Most of the team remained
on board throughout implementation. Although there were five different coordinators, most came
from inside the team and thus provided continuity. The team possessed strong M&E skills, which
helped to keep the Project focused. The breadth of the Project posed important coordination and
management challenges initially, but over time these were well addressed. At first there were
insufficient linkages with National programs, in part because National programs felt “supervised?.
However with time they began to see the CU as a facilitator. Provincial coordinators played a key
role in the Provinces, providing direct, daily support to MSPs in the implementation of the Project.
While capacity varied, they have been instrumental in ensuring Project progress.

86.    For the reasons outlined earlier, the performance of UFI-S is rated as Moderately
Satisfactory. While UFI-S was well staffed, and had considerable experience in the management
of fiduciary aspects of Bank-finance projects, annual audit reports and Bank fiduciary reviews
consistently found weaknesses in financial and procurement management. Performance improved
gradually through the implementation and supervision of the GAAP.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

87.    For reasons outlined above, overall Borrower performance is rated as Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
88.    Financing public health functions instead of vertical programs (HIV/AIDS,
Immunization, etc.) allows for the improvement of the delivery of vertical programs while
strengthening health systems overall. Focusing on functions strengthened links between central
and local programs and between vertical programs nationally and at the local level, all of which
improved the effectiveness of delivery.

89.     In federal settings where provinces have a large degree of autonomy, the signing of 5-
year umbrella agreements between federal and state levels outlining each party’s
responsibilities protects against political risk. Despite two changes of provincial administrations,
Project reforms were sustained.

90.    Results-based financing linking production of activities to financing can be
transformative in a short period of time. PHA financing, an innovative feature of this
Project, had visible effects in changing behavior even when implemented for a short period
and involving a relatively small amount of funds. The changes introduced in 23 Provinces were
achieved with only US$25 million. Targeting incentives to areas requiring greater improvements


                                                17
in the Provinces was successful in bringing these areas to management´s attention. Equally
successful was the linking of disbursements to GOA with the establishment of medical supply
management systems in the Provinces.

91.     Results-based financing combined with third party verification of results is a
powerful tool to improve performance and accountability in the health sector. The addition of
the third party audit to assess progress with respect to APAs and production of PHAs greatly
enhances the focus on results.

92.     The inclusion of an Emergency Contingency Component in investment operations is
an effective approach to address emergencies. Revolving funds combined with disbursement
against a positive list of goods provided timely financing for emergency activities. The use of
simplified procurement procedures, and subjecting them to an ex-post review allowed for timely
procurement while maintaining the necessary safeguards. Given the rise in natural disasters and
epidemics, the design of the component could strengthen countries ability to prepare for, respond
to, and recover from major disasters.

93.    Realistic risk assessment regarding implementation capacity will ensure the needed
support is built into project design. Better anticipation of TA needs could have led to the
development of a mechanism for the provision of TA and training as part of Project design,
avoiding the challenges faced during Project start-up. The human resources the PAD envisioned
were clearly insufficient to address the needs of the Provinces.

94.    Project evaluation methodologies need to be defined during preparation to ensure the
needed information is available. While large-scale pre-and post-surveys are not necessary to
measure project impact, it is important to ensure the data required are available in the form and
timing needed up front. Waiting until after the Project has been under implementation for some
time may limit the ability to carry out a rigorous analysis. Impact evaluations carried out for PAI,
Blood Safety and the Environmental Safeguard all noted difficulties with the data.

95.     A GAAP is an effective way to reduce implementation risks and improve governance
and accountability. The GAAP provides a common fiduciary tool to address overall systemic
accountability issues. Its joint design with the Government will increase ownership and
effectiveness. In addition, agreed supervision plan and regular close supervision by the Bank’s
fiduciary team has substantially reduced implementation risk since its introduction.

                                Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.      The overall project outcomes are considered satisfactory given that the Project
objectives and design remain highly relevant, that achievement of objectives is rated as
Satisfactory, and that it contributed to a more efficient use of resources related with activities and
outputs.

2.     Despite slow start-up, the Project utilized the totality of the loan. Underspent funds
were reallocated to establish and strengthen the AES, complete construction of some laboratories,
to project management as it ended up absorbing three times as much as projected. The Blood
Safety Program absorbed 10 percent of project costs, as did the HIV/AIDS program and the
Reproductive Health program although the latter two received primarily medical supplies. The
Immunization Program, received close to 30 percent of the loan, and vector related activities,
excluding surveillance, received 16 percent of the loan.

3.     Component 1: Strengthen National Health Stewardship and Capacity to Carry Out
Essential Public Health Functions

4.     Implementation of this component suffered important delays, in part due to
procurement delays in Subcomponent 1A and to difficulties in designing an accreditation
instrument which affected the identification of procurement needs for Subcomponent 1B.

5.      Subcomponent 1A. Strengthen EPHF and Management of Key Public Health
Programs at the National Level. Financing was provided for information systems including
computer hardware and software; connectivity; risk factor health surveys; cold chain for
immunization; training courses to improve capacity; construction, rehabilitation, and equipping of
public health laboratories; consultant services; materials for dissemination and social
communication and national health education campaigns; national and international TA; and
scientific and public gatherings to disseminate information, and MSN’s incremental operating
costs. The focus of this component was the strengthening of health surveillance and the laboratory
network, revision and updating of program norms and protocols, and health promotion.

6.      Regulation. A review and updating regulations related to EPHFs and PPHPs, also to be
applied in Subcomponent 1B and Component 3, was carried out. The review resulted in the
definition of regulations related to the reduction of exposure to risk factors, including some related
to the publication, production and consumption of tobacco based products. Through the Healthy
Municipalities Network, more than 150 municipalities established laws for enforcement of tobacco
control, and there are many municipalities working on efforts to introduce food regulation. The
project supported the design and implementation of the Program “menos sal más vida? (less salt,
more life) to reduce the amount of salt used in baking bread at 28,000 bakeries in Argentina.
Currently, 7,000 bakeries are enrolled in the program. The Project financed the development of a
Federal Register of Health Facilities and a Federal Register of Health Professionals, both of which
were integrated into the SIISA. It currently is able to register the totality of facilities and human
resources in the country. Quality assurance was strengthened through the preparation of several
clinical guidelines and through the self-evaluation and certification of public hospitals and primary
health care centers.

7.      National public health surveillance information system. Building on the successful
public health surveillance system established through Vigi-A (co-financed by GOA and the World
Bank), the project sought to expand information nodes from the 27 percent of what was needed
(available in 2007), to 90 percent in 2010. The installation of 1640 nodes (70 percent) was
achieved by 2009. No further expansion was made to instead focus on the quality of the nodes.
The network (Sistema Nacional de Vigilancia de la Información de Salud Pública, SNVS) has
improved the timeliness and quality of the data, permitting more agile analysis. In order to better
address the H1N1 epidemic, situation rooms (some of which had been established through VigiA
but fell into disuse) were established in each Province through funding from the H1N1 Project.
With funding from FESP they were certified to address all vector-borne diseases. To become
certified they had to comply with a number of requirements, including, having three
epidemiologists on contract, production of a monthly report for at least six months, a study about
one of the 10 priority programs per year, etc.

8.     The Study of Burden of Disease (2008), Second Behavioral Risk Factor Survey (2009),
and Study of Health Service Utilization and Costs (2010) generated key inputs for policy
development.

9.      Strengthen the public health laboratory network. As per the PAD, the Project sought
to strengthen the public health laboratory network through the modernization of twelve Provincial
and twelve Regional public health laboratories, including the upgrading of one bio-safety level
(BSL) 3 laboratory and two BSL2 laboratories. Long delays were experienced in the bidding
processes of these civil works. In the end only one BSL 3 (the Dr. Julio Maiztegui Human
Virology Laboratory), and one BSL 2 (Dr. Malbrán Infectious Diseases Laboratory) were
constructed. Planned BSL2 and BSL3 laboratories at Dr. Emilio Coni Laboratory, and a BSL2 at
Dr. Malbrán Institutes of Health laboratory complex were dropped, although designs were
developed. In addition, a Center for Control of Biological and Biotechnical Products at Instituto
Nacional de Medicamentos de la Administración Nacional de Medicamentos, Alimentos y
Tecnología Médica INAME/ANMAT was designed (to be constructed under FESP II). In addition,
a Regional Hemotherapy Center at the Garrahan Hospital was completed. Thus, only three civil
works were constructed. Many of these will be constructed through FESP II. Equipment was
provided for several laboratories. The laboratory network was also strengthened through the
improvement in the Laboratory-based Surveillance System (SIVILA, Sistema de Vigilancia por
Laboratorios). SIVILA was fine-tuned to provide more specific case information to improve case
detection and a better integration with other laboratory information systems. Quality control of
laboratory procedures was established and training in epidemiological surveillance provided. All
surveillance systems were integrated.

10.    After the dengue and H1N1 epidemics in 2009, a decision was made to create, in
November 2009, the Argentine Epidemiological Shield (AES) and the Directorate of Vector-borne
Diseases within MSN to strengthen capacity for epidemiological surveillance and control of
epidemics of national, provincial and municipal institutions responsible for public health. AES
builds on Vigi-A investments and consists of a coordinated network bringing together MSN,
MSPs and academic institutions working on surveillance. Coordination takes place at the level of
COFESA. Underspent funds from other activities were redirected to strengthen the AES.




                                                21
11.     Health Promotion. Each Province was to have a multidisciplinary team to develop a
strategy for health promotion in the Province. Only 21 of the 24 Provinces had a multidisciplinary
team and thus this indicator was not met. The Project provided TA to local teams in the
development of their own strategy. A National Strategic Plan for Health Promotion was developed
to coordinate actions of health programs and agencies. Health promotion materials were revised to
focus on the current epidemiological profile, and approaches were improved. Most health
promotion carried out during the Project was in print, focusing on the benefits of adopting health
life styles (promotion of healthy nutrition, exercise and smoking cessation) and materials on
NCDs and their risk factors. No mass media campaigns were carried out except in 2011 when an
animation promoting healthy habits was transmitted via television. Some radio messages were also
developed. Salt reduction in processed foods was promoted through a strategic alliance with the
private sector.

12.     Strengthen case management of HIV/AIDS patients. Case-management software was
introduced in the HIV/AIDS program in the last year of the project for better patient follow-up.
The software tracks clinical information, lab results and treatment on each patient, allowing for the
assessment of the quality of treatment, adherence and resistance to treatment. All Provinces are
linked into the system. By the end of 2012 just over 30,000 patients were included.

13.     Strengthen health resource management. A database consolidating information on
health sector resources, including health facilities and human resources, SIISA, was developed and
was integrated to SSMI.

14.     Quality Assurance. A review and updating of norms and protocols for ten PPHPs, which
would then be used as a basis for the accreditation system to be established at the provincial level
under Subcomponent 1B was carried out. However, considerable difficulties were encountered in
the conceptualization of the accreditation instrument. (For details refer to “accreditation? under
Subcomponent 1B). This review also helped fine-tune PHAs financed under Component 3. The
cultural appropriateness of delivery of PPHPs among indigenous populations was assessed and
formed part of each province’s Indigenous People’s Plan (IPP). The 19 Provinces with indigenous
populations prepared and implemented IPPs (discussed under Safeguards).

15.    Subcomponent 1B: Strengthen EPHF and Management of Key Public Health
Programs at the Provincial Level. Financing is provided for MSN to: (a) strengthen capacity at
the provincial level (through the provision of TA, connectivity, small infrastructure and equipment
updating, studies and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) support, communication campaigns), (b)
formulate and implement APAs between MSN and Provinces, (c) develop and implement
accreditation mechanisms for public health functions and programs, (d) implement healthy
municipalities network and Indigenous People’s Plans (IPPs).

16.    Annual Performance Agreements. APAs were to be negotiated and monitored under this
component. Seventeen APAs were signed by 2007; 20, by 2008; 21, by 2009; and 23, by 2010.
The last province (Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires) did not join the Project until 2011. A
system was developed to track progress with respect to the indicators. APAs contained both PHAs
and project intermediate indicators (PDIs). The first two years disbursements focused on
achievement of agreed PHAs. In the third and fourth years, focus turned to the achievement of
four KPIs. If they did not meet the agreed results, they would be “taxed? 25 percent of the


                                                 22
available resource per KPI not met. For Provinces that were underperforming, the “tax? did not
affect them much as they were already not receiving a large share of their resources. PHAs
reported were verified by an external technical auditing firm on a regular basis. In the third year,
auditors also verified the achievement of PDIs on APAs. Meeting targets defined in APAs
improved somewhat over time from 60 percent in 2008 to 68 percent in 2011. However, meeting
PHA targets, while improving since 2007, only reached 33 percent of what was planned in 2011
(the last year for which data are complete).

17.     Accreditation. As part of the project, an instrument to assess the performance/capacity of
provinces vis-à-vis the implementation of the EPHFs was to be developed and applied. The
assessment was to indicate what areas each Province needed to strengthen and would identify
procurement, training and TA that would be needed to raise the Province to the needed level of
performance to become accredited. As per the PAD, the instrument would be applied every year to
track the Province’s performance with regards to their capacity to implement EPHFs. There was
no instrument when the project began. Developing it took 3 years. There was no experience in the
country with this type of instrument or much international experience. PAHO had developed a tool
to measure EPHF based on focus groups, but it was too subjective. The instrument prepared by the
project team was quantitative but became unwieldy, and by mid-2010, during the preparation of
the MTR, a decision was made to drop it and develop a much simpler version (with 107 items)
that was finally applied to each province during 2011. Thus, it was too late to serve as a basis to
define investments for each Province. The investments were instead defined on the basis of
guidelines as to what was generally needed to strengthen EPHFs and were procured centrally. The
tool was applied in 22 Provinces in 2011 and will be repeated in 2013. While it was applied only
once, it provided a good diagnosis of each Province’s situation, identifying missing links, gaps,
inconsistencies and problems that needed to be addressed. Although there are plans to have
Provinces apply this instrument regularly on their own to keep track of their performance,
interviews with health authorities in two Provinces suggested greater ownership needs to be built,
and the instrument needs to be adapted to each Province’s reality. One positive outcome of the
process of defining the accreditation tool and its application was that it forced vertical programs at
both levels to begin to engage with each other to improve coordination.

18.     Healthy Municipalities Network. MSN established the Healthy Municipalities Network
in 2001 as a vehicle for community empowerment and to promote community health initiatives
such as water and sanitation, health lifestyles. The project financed the expansion of this program
and financed small health projects through calls for proposals. Through the Project, 854
municipalities became members of the network (many more than the 750 planned), 485 were
accredited as full members (over the target of 400), and 295 of them were from the targeted areas
(NOA and NEA). Three calls for proposals were made (2007, 2009, 2010) in five Provinces,
including Catamarca, Jujuy, Salta, Santiago del Estero and Tucumán. A total of 333 municipal
health promotion projects were financed, including on road safety, healthy nutrition and exercise.
The network played a crucial role in health education during the H1N1 and dengue outbreaks.
Municipalities formed health promotion teams in 2009. They developed action plans that were
implemented between 2009 and 2012.

19.   Technical Assistance. Two consultants were assigned to each Province to assist in the
implementation of key project activities. A regional coordinator, also living in the Provinces,
would provide additional support. Provincial consultants had a strategic role, partnering with local


                                                 23
counterparts to move project reforms forward. In addition, numerous consultancies were
contracted to provide training and specific TA that were instrumental in the implementation of
project activities in the Provinces. Some of these activities were not well managed at first, but with
time management and effectiveness of consultancies improved.

20.    Component 2: Strengthen Inputs Management and Performance Monitoring of
Priority Public Health Programs and Preparedness for Health Emergencies

21.     Subcomponent 2A: Strengthen Inputs Management and Performance Monitoring for
Priority Public Health Programs. This component financed all medications and medical
supplies needed to deliver the ten PPHPs. The disbursement of funds for this component was
conditioned on the number of computerized supply management systems installed (to manage the
logistics and inventory of these inputs) in the Provinces. This ensured the timely design and
installation of the SSMI. The Project began tracking supplies through Microsoft Excel. By 2007
seven Provinces were working with the SSMI for inputs needed for blood safety, immunization
and TB. The number doubled by 2008. By 2010, a web-based system was introduced, piloted first
with immunization supplies. All but one Province were using SSMI for the three programs by the
end of 2010. At present, all Provinces are using SSMI, and HIV/AIDS and vector-borne diseases
have been included. In addition, SSMI is being expanded within Provinces to health regions and
municipalities. Currently 14 Provinces are beginning to use SSMI for internal distribution.

22.   Subcomponent B – Improve Argentina’s Preparedness and Response to a Potential
Avian Influenza Epidemic, other Health Emergencies and Natural Disasters

23.    The National Integrated Plan for Response to an Avian Influenza Pandemic was agreed
with the Bank during Project preparation. The National Health Emergency and Natural Disaster
Preparedness Plan was to be prepared during project implementation on the basis of the Pan
American Health Organization’s (PAHO’s) Operational Manual for Addressing Natural Disasters.
The project would finance goods, services and operating costs.

24.     Dengue Epidemic. Argentina confronted two epidemics in the first half of 2009,
triggering this component. In the dengue epidemic of early 2009 close to 27,000 people were
infected, and five died. Improvements in surveillance led to 96 percent reduction in cases (to
1280) and no deaths in 2010 and to 322 cases and zero deaths in 2011. Meanwhile neighboring
countries were experiencing outbreaks, sometimes greater than in 2009. Soon after, in May 2009,
the first case of H1N1 was detected, reaching its peak by early July. Close to 12,000 cases were
confirmed, of which 626 died. The virus continued circulating in 2010, with the last death
registered in January 2010.

25.     Health Emergency and Avian Influenza. A Health Emergency Preparedness Plan and an
Avian Influenza Preparedness Plan were prepared to be ready in case an emergency was declared.
The declaration of the emergency would trigger access to project funds in the amount required up
to the total allocated under the subcomponent. Once triggered a revolving fund was set up for
rapid disbursement, to be used to finance needed activities, employing simplified procurement
procedures, and subjecting them to an ex-post review. These procedures facilitated rapid
implementation while addressing fiduciary requirements.

26.     Component 3: Implement and Expand a Package of Priority Public Health Programs
at the Provincial Level.

27.      PHAS. PHAs include selected operating costs (excluding salaries and medical supplies)
required to deliver PPHP activities at the Provincial level. These were activities that programs
were already carrying out, but not always in a systematic way, and which were not recorded in a
uniform manner. Draft PHAs and their costing were developed during preparation. They were
fine-tuned during 2007 and early 2008, and their implementation began in early 2008. The Project
began with 45 PHAs, which were increased to 63 in 2009 to include dengue and some additional
ones for blood safety, HIV and regulation. The system took a long time to take off and did not
really begin functioning well until 2009. Although Provinces could choose from the menu of 45
PHAs, depending on local needs, the content of each PHA was pre-defined, and thus Provinces
with limited human resources or more dispersed populations faced greater hurdles in meeting their
targets. Differences in social reality also mattered. The HIV/AIDS program, for instance, called
for a given number of interventions (PHAs) with specific populations when there was no
information indicating those populations existed. PHA targets for each Province were defined on
the basis of baselines developed by National Programs during preparation, and their accuracy was
not verified with the Provinces. Thus, the planned volume of PHAs sometimes did not reflect local
reality. Together, these two factors generated considerable resistance during the first two years of
implementation, together with the lack of experience with working under such scrutiny regarding
their daily routines, and the complicated nature of the system limited uptake. The increased
scrutiny came not only from provincial program managers and authorities but also from the
technical audit that deducted activities that were not properly documented. In addition, although
execution increased annually, the 16 percent of planned PHAs executed in 2008 only increased to
33 percent in 2011. Software to monitor PHAs was developed in 2012 and is being piloted. The
implementation of PHAs had a very positive effect in program management. Norms and protocols
were homogenized, as was the information registered on program outputs and outcomes. At the
local level, the application of PHAs forced programs to better organize their activities and to
improve the timeliness and accuracy of reporting. The system gave incentives to Provincial health
authorities rather than implementers as the additional revenue gained from meeting targets did not
necessarily return to the relevant department.

28.   Component 4: Management and governance of the Essential Public Health Functions
and Programs

29.     Subcomponent A – Project Management and Administration. This subcomponent
financed staff for the PCU, UFI-S and a small group of staff deployed to Provinces requiring
support; administrative expenses; office equipment and operational expenses. PCU was to have a
total of 13 staff whose services would slowly be mainstreamed into MSN and Provincial regular
procedures and the consultancies equivalent to 17 staff for activities associated with management
of results. In addition, two consultants would be supported per Province, to be located in the
Province, for a total of 48. By 2009 it was expected only 24 consultants would be needed to
support Provinces. From 2010 to 2011, the number of staff financed by the Project jumped from
68 to 160, climbing to 162 at Project closing. This does not include the 636 consultancies that
were financed during the last two years of implementation. As many as 152 staff are currently
being financed under FESP II. Under FESP II, the MSN was asked to prepare an Action Plan to
reduce the number of staff and consultants financed by the Project.


                                                25
30.     Subcomponent B – Improve the Governance of the Public Health System, Concurrent
Auditor, and Program Monitoring and Evaluation. This subcomponent was to finance (i) the
Concurrent Audit to verify the meeting of targets in APAs; (ii) make information available to the
public on Project implementation, and (iii) increase civil society participation to monitor and
evaluate Project performance, maintain transparency and increase competition practices in public
procurement. There is no specific mention of a Project evaluation, per se. The concurrent auditor
was contracted. Information on project implementation was developed and disseminated but
probably insufficiently in the beginning when MSPs were not fully informed as to the benefits and
strategic nature of the Project. Nothing was done on involving civil society to provide
accountability to Project performance.

1.      Changes in efficiency were assessed in three programs, all indicating improved
efficiency of use of resources due to Project inputs. The Project contributed to the
improvement of results with fewer resources through the implementation of the SSMI for PAI,
Blood Safety, TB and HIV. The HIV monitoring system for patients increased the efficiency of
prescription and delivery of antiretroviral treatment, as well as patient follow-up. In the case of
Blood Safety, the centralization of blood banks led to a major scaling up of plasma production and
reduction of supplies costs and infection rates.

2.     The FESP Program financed the development of the SSMI, a software developed to
improve the logistics of medical supplies of critical public health programs. The SSMI allowed the
organization and optimization of the inventory and distribution of health supplies reducing the
number of expired products and distribution time.

3.      The Project also financed the development and implementation of a monitoring
system for HIV-AIDS patients which has improved the registration and follow-up of patients,
as well as the timeliness and accuracy of treatment. The system allows for the online
registration of identified patients, online request for authorizations, the monitoring of patient’s
viral load and other follow-up tests, the provision of medication, and connectivity to the SSMI to
ensure timely delivery of medications. Currently, all HIV-AIDS Provincial programs are
implementing the online monitoring system and are linked electronically with the National AIDS
Program. The system has facilitated and accelerated the submission and approval of prescriptions
for treatment and viral load testing. For antiretroviral treatment, the elapsed time for authorizations
declined from 15 days to 48 hours. Viral load authorization declined from 30 days to immediate
as the system now allows automatic authorizations for viral load. The system also increased the
accuracy of follow-up and prescription, reducing resistance to antiretrovirals. The system has also
improved efficiency of supply of reagents and medications.

4.     The system has also helped reduce subsidies to health insurance groups as it has
permitted the cross-comparison of patients needing treatment with the health insurance
database. By the end of 2012, 653 patients previously receiving subsidies were found to be
covered by either provincial or national health insurance.

5.      The National Blood Safety Program increased the efficiency and effectiveness of
blood collection and production of components by consolidating the existing Blood Banks. As
noted earlier, twenty central Blood Banks were organized while hospital-based blood banks were
reduced by almost half. The centralization of blood banking has substantially reduced
expenditures on supplies for screening and identification of blood types. It has also allowed for
better quality assurance, which, along with increased voluntary blood donation, has reduced rates
of transfusion-transmitted infections.

Introduction:	description	of	FESP	I	
Project	
During the life of the Project (2006-2012), Argentina has experienced intense economic recovery
following the country’s severe crisis in 2001-2002.

Since 2003, the Government has responded to new priorities in the sector through the
implementation of reform policies, defined in the Federal Health Plan 2004 – 2007 (Plan Federal
de Salud - PFS). The PFS was made possible thanks to national Government leadership during the
crisis and the immediate repercussions which revitalized the Federal Health Council (Consejo
Federal de Salud - COFESA) as an effective coordination mechanism between federal and
provincial levels.

In this context, the Essential Public Health Functions Project was designed to support the
Argentine Government’s health policies and its aims to reduce mortality and morbidity associated
with collective diseases, and contribute to reinforce the stewardship role of the National Ministry
of Health and the Provincial Health Ministries (MSP), through the development of Essential
Public Health Functions and the strengthening of a set of priority programs (10) according to the
goals established in the PFS.

      Essential Public Health Functions                 Key Public Health Programs
     1. Monitoring and Evaluation                1. Inmunizations
     2. Supervision/Disease Control              2. Tuberculosis
     3. Health Promotion                         3. AIDS / STDs
     4. Community Participation                  4. Vector-borne Diseases
                                                 5. Sexual Health and Responsible
     5. Planning and Administration              Procreation
     6. Regulation and Supervision               6. Non-Communicable Diseases
     7. Promotion of Equitable Access            7. Safe Blood
     8. Development of Human Resources           8. Communicable/Emerging Diseases
     9. Quality Guarantee                        9. Emergencies and Disasters
     10. Public Health Research                  10. Border Controls
     11. Reduction of Impacts of Health
     Emergencies and Disasters

The Project was implemented by the Secretary of Promotion and Health Programs for the National
Ministry of Health, through a Central Coordination Unit together with the National Directorates
and Programs in charge of functions and priority public health programs, also including the
Ministries of Health from the 24 provincial jurisdictions and with support from the International
Health Financing Unit (UFI-S) which specializes in financial management and procurement
procedures for multilateral projects implemented through the health portfolio.



                                                35
It is an innovative project, which through its matrix design has allowed public health functions and
programs to cross over and implement actions from a broad and flexible operational framework,
positioning it as a strengthening strategy for the MSN and participating Provincial Ministries of
Health’s institutional capacity, as well as introducing a new form of interaction between the World
Bank and the Government of Argentina (GOA).


Project Objectives
The Project’s development objectives were to increase coverage of ten priority Public Health
Programs; reduce the population’s exposure to risk factors associated with collective diseases; and
improve the stewardship role and appropriate regulatory environment in the National Public
Health System. The proposed Project aspired to/proposed to support Argentina’s Federal Health
Plan and its objectives to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with collective diseases.
Project Development Indicators (PDO)
    Cases of measles originating in Argentina remained at zero.
    Cases of congenital Rubella reached zero by the end of the Project.
    Decrease of 6% in smoking.
    20 Situation Rooms for Epidemic Surveillance and Vector-Borne Disease Control have
       been created and certified.
    The total of voluntary blood donations has increased to 30%.
    20 of the 24 Provinces are certified for essential public health functions and programs,
       developed with minimum standards and regulations for the ten priority programs.

Execution of the Project is organized in four inter-related components:
     Component 1: Strengthening the National Steering Role and the Capacity to Execute
     Essential Public Health Functions and Priority Programs.
     Component 2: Strengthening Resource Management, Monitoring Priority Public Health
     Programs and Emergency Health Response.
     Component 3: Implementation and Strengthening of a set of priority Public Health Programs
     at provincial level.
     Component 4: Project Management and Administration.

The Indigenous and Environmental Safeguards were also implemented according to IBRD
regulatory criteria corresponding to World Bank Operational Policies.


Main	actions	taken		
Actions taken by the Project were aimed at reaching the objectives of reducing the population’s
exposure to collective diseases risk factors, the increase in priority program coverage and
improvement of the Argentine National Ministry of Health’s and the 23 Provincial Ministries of
Health and the City of Buenos Aires’ steering role, through an investment of USD 220 million.



                                                36
The main features of the financing model implemented by FESP can be summarized in the
following points:
           a. The Project included a monetary transfer system from National Government to the
              Provinces based on results, for implementation of 63 Public Health activities, duly
              selected and standardized, whose execution implied sending more financial
              resources to Provinces to improve and attain results that strengthen provincial
              health systems and their response capacity.

           b. It involved a planning process agreed upon between the National Government and
              the Provinces, which is shown in the annual spending commitments, aimed at
              continuous improvements (management commitments are made, ASPs are
              designed and implemented according to the provincial health situation and National
              Program objectives) which are later reimbursed to the Provinces.

           c. It strengthened National Programs through the purchase of resources, and the
              planning and organization of health activities.

           d. A permanent, effective supervision mechanism was set up which generates up to
              date health data and is an essential source of information for the generation of
              health evidence.

           e. A strategic national health promotion plan and health promotion units at the
              provincial level were developed.


Public health activities carried out as part of the project have developed capacity in the national
and provincial ministries for monitoring and measuring results, promoting systematic policy,
program and service evaluation, and using measuring data to improve program implementation.
These improvements achieved in monitoring and evaluation capacity have also allowed for
available information about diseases to be optimized and indicator quality improved.

The ASP generated positive externality in the provinces and programs, such as improvements in
provincial management systems. An example of this is the ASP related to the essential function of
health promotion, that have improved institutional organization, in the registration,
systematization, diagnosis and planning of provincial structures and strategies; the design and
construction of provincial promotion structures according to minimum standardized requirements
in results indicators (21 units as of December 2010), with supporting, legal instrumentation,
planning, and inter-sectoral and inter-programmatic tasks.
Performance based payments and economic resources assigned to Provinces for the execution of
ASP have been an important incentive for their achievement.

In addition, actions carried out for the Environmental Safeguard went beyond the evaluation
planning framework, generating tools and products and developing activities which were to make
a qualitative leap in environmental safeguards, approaching the diagnosed problem as an
intervention and not just an obligation to complete the environmental safeguard. This meant
diagnosing the problem, fixing it and the corresponding institutional strengthening.

FESP has contributed to the creation of a new health care intelligence by developing and financing
studies and research such as the Burden of Disease Study, the Second National Risk Factor Survey,
the Use and Spending in Health Survey, it also strengthened resource management in the national
and provincial ministries through the Resource Tracking and Monitoring System.

Through the PDOs, the Project contributed to implementation of activities to reduce tobacco
consumption; supervision of health services (maternity, neonatal, pharmacies, sexual health
counseling and responsible procreation centers; vaccinations, etc); application of performance
evaluation for essential public health functions in the provinces; implementation of performance
agreements as a new form of interaction between the National Ministry of Health and the
Provincial Ministries of Health, in terms of public health programs; the implementation of new
registries in the Integrated Health Information System (Sistema Integrado de información en Salud
(SIISA)) such as the Registry of Health Care Professionals, Health Services, technology
evaluation, the registry of vaccinations, registry of injuries, etc; the creation of Clinical Practice
Guides.



Results	
Indicator Achievement
The main actions implemented by the FESP have contributed to fulfilling all the FESP Project’s
global indicators. All epidemiological monitoring goals for measles and rubella have been met;
situation rooms for the control of vector-borne diseases (Chagas and Dengue) have been
implemented; the prevalence of smoking has been reduced; 30% voluntary blood donations has
been reached and Essential Public Health Functions were measured in 22 Argentine provinces.
In addition, together with the increase in voluntary blood donations (30%), the risk of associated
Transfusion Transmitted Infections has decreased (-38%). The number of patients receiving
specific treatment for tuberculosis has increased; the availability of contraception has also
increased through the strengthening of the Contraceptive Supplies Assurance System; the number
of voluntary HIV/AIDS tests has increased.
Through the strengthening of the Healthy Municipalities Network, with more than 800
municipalities participating in the Program, the consolidation of multidisciplinary teams for health
care promotion in the provinces and the implementation of strategic plans for promotion, progress
has been made in the prevention of risk factors and non-communicable chronic diseases.
As part of the Project’s closing stage, impact evaluations were carried out, which provided
evidence about the dimension of the changes generated by FESP I in a group of priority programs.

The impact evaluation for the Safe Blood Program showed that provinces that received a
contribution from FESP registered 21% more voluntary donors than those that didn’t receive a
contribution, 61% more voluntary donors and 2% less units that were reactive to infection.

The results of the impact study for the National Immunizable Diseases Program (Programa
Nacional de Enfermedades Inmunoprevenibles (ProNaCEI)) showed that the majority of new



                                                 38
cases of immunizable diseases decreased, and that FESP had a positive impact on the increase in
coverage rates for all analyzed vaccinations.

The results of the Environmental Safeguard impact evaluation provided evidence about the
positive, statistically significant relationship between the Environmental Safeguard’s actions,
represented by a number of trainings, and Action Plan follow-up visits, where the results
indicators considered: management, documentation, building, treatment.

Institutional Strengthening
FESP introduced the results-based management model in a set of public health programs, on the
national level as well as in each of the 24 provinces that participated in the Project.
Implementation of the results-based management model in public health programs meant an
improvement in strategic and operational planning; re-engineering of processes and structure in
public health organisms; alignment of operational plans and development of evaluation
mechanisms and control of results.

In this way, the installation of the FESP Project and the appropriation of its work methodology
and dynamics by different stakeholders in the health system were tasks that meant modifying the
health paradigm and contributing to a cultural change which meant a change from vertical,
compartmentalized programs towards a strategic vision for essential functions, which cross and
integrate the programs.

The Essential Public Health Functions and Programs Project, throughout its execution, has
positioned itself in the MSN as a strategy for the strengthening of institutional capacity in the
MSN and the Provincial Health Ministries.

Institutional strengthening of the MSN and the MSP can be analyzed by the contribution FESP has
made to change the management model, in the financing model for the programs and priority
functions within the project.

FESP developed a strategic performance measuring tool for Essential Public Health Functions,
given the need to adopt measuring indicators and standards to measure the EPHF so as to
strengthen the practice of public health through supporting the institutional capacity for diagnosis
and planning.
The Project has also contributed to strengthening of community participation and improvement of
health care related communication.

The introduction of the financing model linked to public health program objectives has been a
key instrument in the Project, and putting it into practice favored the adequate implementation of
each of the management units involved, whilst at the same time improved regulatory aspects and
the National Health System’s leadership role.

Throughout the implementation of FESP, it has been evident that the ASP formed the basis for the
reorganization of relationships with programs at a national and provincial level and facilitated the
articulation of national policy, standardization of information and resource transfer, linking
National financial support to the Provinces with activities involving measurable health results.



                                                39
The Project has also contributed to the sustainability of the objectives, through the formation of
technical teams and trainings given in different provinces and programs which have left installed
capacities and are fundamental to the continuity of strategies. In addition, IT assets have been
acquired and software developed which have contributed to the better functioning of diverse
information networks, essential to the strengthening of health intelligence.

It is also worth noting that the selected indicators have been an instrument for monitoring and
evaluation of the achievement of objectives set by the Project. At the same time, the Essential
Public Health Project and the Priority Public Health Programs have generated important positive
externalities, including other achievements and landmarks, which have exceeded what’s reflected
through the indicators.

As a result of this, the process of online connectivity for the HIV-AIDS program is important to
mention, as it required the development of software (SVIH) which was implemented over the past
year in all of the different jurisdictions in the country, allowing for online patient registration,
authorization requests, patient follow-up and dispensing of medicine, as well as connectivity with
resource monitoring, constituting the AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Diseases Directorate as a
real center for regulation and governance of the HIV/AIDS clinic.

The consolidation of the Contraceptive Supplies Assurance System is also to be highlighted, with
its aim to promote equity and reduce gaps in existing inequalities, promoting free, universal access
to contraceptive supplies for the prevention of unwanted pregnancies. The Project has financed the
procurement of hormonal contraception and intrauterine devices, allocating USD 7.8 million to
this and thereby contributing to the improvement of contraceptive treatments and strengthening
health teams through training and technical assistance.

The improvement of federal infrastructure not only reinforced the essential function of monitoring,
risk and damage control for public health (FESP 2), but it also favored equal access to necessary
health services (FESP 7), while at the same time positively influencing research, development and
implementation of innovative health solutions (FESP 10).

Strengthening governance and health intelligence
FESP has contributed to the creation of a new health intelligence, which is necessary when
making decisions in highly complex socio-health contexts, supporting, developing, monitoring and
financing studies and instruments.

FESP has allowed the Health System’s governance to improve in articulation and its relationship
with the National Government (MSN) and Provincial Ministries of Health. The FESP Project put a
system of monetary transfers between the Nation and the Provinces into place, based on quality
results (achievement of standardized health actions) and achievement of health aims measured on
the baseline indicators called “global, mid-term and results.? This meant sending more resources
to the Provinces as a result of better results achieved, in the context of a transfer system based on
results.

Reinforcing the stewardship role can also be seen through the measuring of essential public health
functions’ performance using a federal tool, designed by the Project, which allows strengths,
progress and critical areas for improvement in the Provincial Health Ministries to be identified, in


                                                 40
terms of the strengthening of functions at national level. Now the country has measurements in 22
of 24 provinces for essential functions, carried out in 2011, which forms an observatory for each
of the provinces, a kind of dashboard for managing follow-up, monitoring and evaluation of
provincial health policies. The tool also adds to planning of policies in provinces, at the same time,
the resulting information from the first measurement provides a baseline to be considered during
the execution of FESP II.

At project closing, it can be said that Argentina is the first country in the region that has designed
its own tool to measure functions, and which defines this tool as complementary to the one
designed by PAHO/WHO. The instrument designed by the Project is aimed at evaluating a
province’s performance in a federal system, and in the context of prioritized Health policies.

Another positive result of Project implementation arose from the existence of a structured
accountability system, through the consolidation and full incorporation of an External Results
Audit (output measuring). The AEC’s purpose was to verify the validity and correspondence of
ASP execution according to requirements established and previously agreed upon between the
National Government and each one of the participating provinces. The observations made by the
audit have allowed the corresponding debits to future reimbursements to be made, and
improvement plans to be drawn up, from the recommendations made by the Central Coordinating
Unit.

In this way, it can be noted that the design of the Concurrent Audit has definitely collaborated in
fostering an accountability culture, which has been an incentive for better quality documentation,
with standardized protocols at National level, as well as the verification of results by an impartial
third party.


Lessons	learned	
Environmental Safeguard: It is important that specialized consultants accompany and supervise
hospitals, until waste management committees are formed in each hospital. Three annual visits are
considered, on average, to be required to evoke the necessary commitment on behalf of the
hospital.

Indigenous Safeguard: The PPI show potential for an effective dialogue on a provincial level in
terms of public health work which involved the priority programs, the areas responsible for public
health functions, provincial stakeholders and relevant people in the program’s health care
networks. This work should be accompanied through the strengthening of provincial structures in
charge of health care with Indigenous Populations.
Analysis of work processes and levels of execution has allowed observation of the difficulties
generated by relying on a similar management model in all jurisdictions, without taking into
account the different complexities in terms of extension and socio-political organization, which
require an adjustment in the number of provincial consultants in each case.




                                                 41
The lack of formal commitments with the programs regarding baselines and goals was an obstacle
when monitoring and carrying out indicator results evaluations. A similar situation occurred with
the estimations in coverage gaps, where some differences were reported between national and
provincial programs. It is essential for future projects to have Management Agreements with
priority programs, so as to formalize the baselines as well as the objectives and the Project’s
implementation and evaluation framework.
The emergency produced by the dengue outbreak and the H1N1 epidemic created the opportunity
to open and consolidate strong channels of communication between municipal, provincial and
national governments, and it was then that the Project gained greater visibility and prominence,
thereby laying the foundations for consensus mechanisms related to health care policies to be
implemented urgently.


Project management has built a fluid relationship with the national programs by maintaining a
frequent presence at the Ministry and through positive interpersonal communication, which has
facilitated circulation of information and improved administrative processes and program
management. The good relationship developed with the provinces and programs as well as the
commitment in the confidentiality of information were both key to the success of the
implementation of the FESP measuring tool. Close communication, on the basis of agreements
and consensus, are essential to the successful implementation of projects of this kind.
Consolidation of information systemization and in some cases nominalization of registries
facilitates identification of functioning resources and helps with the orientation of health
management strategies to achieve greater equity in health service access for the population.
Finally, it is important to highlight that the changes generated don’t only depend on the amount of
resources assigned, but they also mean structural and also cultural reform which require:

              Consolidate role redefinition in national and provincial health systems so as to
               exercise stewardship in health.

              Continue with changes in individual and group behaviors for the main stakeholders
               in the system that are involved.

              Deepen institutional changes to make them more flexible and introduce the
               necessary tools for an instrument which identifies sectors to strengthen and/or
               modify.

              Extend the introduction of new resource assignment mechanisms to concrete goals
               so that they are aligned with results sought by the health strategy.

              Secure the results measuring system, which should allow standardization and
               flexibility processes for potential claims and should be external to the relevant
               actors.

These five points also require the continuing development of actions that link National and
Provincial levels, and among themselves and health care providers, with the aim of developing


                                                42
more efficient processes, incorporating management tools which respond to the different realities
in the regional, provincial and municipal health regions, so as to strengthen public health actions.
