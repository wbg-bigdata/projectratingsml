                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This ISR reflects the findings of a visit conducted from September 23 to 27, 2013.

                         1.        The project is completing the last activities (closing date of December 31, 2013). On the indicators, all PDO indicators are met. However, it is worthwhile to add that PDO
                         indicator related to the EMS teams per capita (cross-country variation) do not adequately reflect the characteristics between regions and should therefore be considered as
                         inadequate for the purpose of measuring project performance. It is also expected that most intermediate outcome indicators will be achieved and/or over-achieved by Project closing.
