MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
-     TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE NINGBO AND SHANGHAI PORTS PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
China for US$76.4 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The loan
would be for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard variable
interest rate.
2.        Back3round.  The transport system in China has been severely taxed
by the pace of recent economic development, and capacity constraints are evi-
dent in all modes. China needs to substantially expand its port and waterway
facilities to relieve the growing constraints to external trade and domestic
transport caused by inadequate berth capacity and container handling capabil-
ity. China's Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90) recognizes these needs. Sub-
stantial investments are envisioned, including technological improvements such
as container handling facilities and intermodal transport centers. To facili-
tate these improvements, significant institutional changes are being carried
out in the sector, including an extension of the policy of separating the
functions of government from those of operating enterprises, tariff reform and
delegating greater authority to local managements. The Bank fully subscribes
to the Government's objectives for development of the transport sector and is
supporting its initiatives with both financial and technical assistance. Four
port projects (Loan 2207-CHA, Loan 2689-CHA, Loan 2877-CHA/Credit 1845-C8A and
Loan 2907-CHA/Credit 1875-CiA) are assisting in improvements at the ports of
Tianjin, Shanghai, Huangpu and Dalian.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Much of the Bank's previous
involvement in the port sector has been motivated by an urgent need to expand
China's port capacity so that it would not impede the continued expansion of
the economy. The regions served by the project ports are no exception and
their future economic growth could be constrained by the limited throughput
capacity of the ports. This project will provide much needed additional port
capacity. However, as a result of the Bank's involvement in the project, far
greater emphasis will be placed on improving the utilization of existing
facilities and maintenance procedures so that future port investments can be
kept to a minimum. Targets have been set, within the port operations improve-
ment action plan, to be achieved within the project. The proposed project
will also contribute to improved investment planning, both at the subsector
level and in the individual ports. A regional water transport optimization
study will address the issues of the relative economic role of the different
ports in the mid-eastern region and how best to exploit the deep-water poten-
tial of Ningbo port. Updating of the master plans in the individual ports
will ensure the most effective use of their investment resources. The project
will also increase the Bank's long-term involvement in the Port of Shanghai,
one of the ten biggest in the world, and lay the foundation for Bank partici-
pation in the much larger investments needed under the Eighth Five-Year Plan
to meet the port requirements for this economically dynamic region of China.
An international panel of experts has been set up to review the Shanghai Port



-2-
Master Plan within the project. Finally, development of a port costing and
management information system will provide a valuable tool to improve effi-
ciency of operations and lay the basis for a review of port tariffs to serve
both economic and financial objectives.
4.        Project Objectives.  The proposed project will focus on: (i) improv-
ing the operating efficiency and the level of maintenance at the ports of
Ningbo and Shanghai; (ii) initiating work on a comprehensive strategy for
future port development in the important mid-eastern region of China, with
particular attention to the deep-water potential at Ningbo and its role rela-
tive to Shanghai as a regional transshipment center; (iii) expansion and
modernization of physical facilities at these two ports; (iv) training of
operational and managerial personnel; (v) improvement of the environmental
impact of port operations and expansion; and (vi) assisting the Ministry of
Communications (MOC) in establishing a port costing and management information
system for all major ports in China.
5.        Project Description.  The proposed project consists of the follow-
ing: (1) For Ningbo: (a) preparation of a regional port optimization study
to define the role of Ningbo's deep-water facilities; (b) updating the port's
master plan; (c) training of operational and managerial personnel; (d) con-
struction of one container and two multipurpose berths; and (e) provision of
cargo handling equipment. (2) For Shanghai: (a) review of the port's master
plan by an international panel of experts; (b) carrying out of a number of
measures to improve the efficiency and safety of operations and the environ-
ment; (c) construction of general cargo, multipurpose and coal berths at
Baoshan, Guangang and Zhujiamen terminals; (d) reconstruction of four berths
and construction of an 80,000-ton grain silo at Minsheng terminal; and
(e) provision of cargo handling equipment.
6.        The project also includes a port costing and management information
system (PCMIS) study to assist the Government in setting up a port costing and
management information system. This last item is the culmination of the
Bank's dialogue with the Government of China on the need to introduce cost-
based tariffs in the country's ports, in order, among other things, to
encourage the use of more efficient cargo-handling techniques and facilities,
which will promote the growth of both domestic and international trade. NPA
and SHB will implement their respective portions of the project, and MOC will
be responsible for the PCMIS study. The Government plans initially to
introduce the resulting PCMIS in Ningbo, Shanghai and Xiamen (which is the
subject of a separate Bank loan), and Dalian (which is currently assisted by
the Bank through Loan 2907-CHA and Credit 1875-CHA) before extending it to
other ports in China.
7.        The total cost of the project is estimated at $340.0 million, with a
foreign exchange component of $225.6 million. To expedite project
implementation, SUB has made arrangements for purchasing about US$4.2 million
worth of equipment and steel structure. Retroactive financing of these items
(from October 1, 1987) is included in the loan.   The financing plan is shown
in Schedule A and the procurement method and disbursements in Schedule B.



-3-
8.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to onlend the proceeds of
the Bank loan to NPA and SHB on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
In addition to implementing the project as described above, including the
study components, each port has agreed to: (a) submit to the Bank its audited
financial statements not later than 6 months after the end of each financial
year; and (b) conduct its financial affairs so as to cover all its costs of
operation from operating revenue and to meet from internally generated funds
all its financial obligations. NPA has also agreed to update its Master Plan
by June 30, 1990; and SHB will have its Master Plan reviewed by a panel of
experts in accordance with terms of reference agreed with the Bank. Both NPA
and SHB have agreed to implement action plans to improve their operational
performance. Specific measures appropriate to each port have been agreed.
WPA and SHB have also undertaken to implement actions to protect and improve
the environment and operational safety, both in their present areas of
operation and in areas financed under the project. These measures will mark
significant improvements in water, air and noise pollution over the present
situation in both ports. Approval of the loan agreement by Caina's State
Council and execution of subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and
NPA and SHB are conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
9.        Justification and Risks.  In 1986 the average waiting time for ships
arriving at Ningbo and Shanghai port was within the limits of normal delays.
However, projected increases in traffic would cause substantial congestion in
the future. Economic benefits of the proposed project derive from: (i) ship
time savings, both waiting for berth and at berth (from the installation of
new equipment and introduction of modern technology); (ii) cargo handling cost
savings; and (iii) cargo time savings. On this basis, the economic rate of
return of the project is 26X at Ningbo and 18X at Shanghai. The main risk
foreseen for the project is delay in construction, but, in view of the
engineering and other preparations already made, this is not considered
likely.
10.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

lb As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the
SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater
than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
Note: The status of the projects listed in Part A is described in a separate report on all
Bank/IDA financial pro;ects in execution, which is updated twice yearly and circulated t
the Executive Directors on April 30 and October 31.
