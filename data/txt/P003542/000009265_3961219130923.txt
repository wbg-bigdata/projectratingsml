NINGBO AND SHANGHAI PORTS PROJECT: SHANGHAI PORT
(LOAN 30061-CHA)
PREFACE
The Shanghai component of the Ningbo and Shanghai Ports Project, Loan 30061-CHA
for $46.4 million, was approved on December 13, 1988 and made effective on May 9, 1989. The
loan, extended once for two years, was closed on December 31, 1995, and final disbursement
was made on January 2, 1996. The loan amount of $45,995,049 was disbursed and the remaining
amount of $404,951 was canceled.
This ICR was prepared by Messrs. Toshiro Tsutsumi (Task Manager) and Han-Kang Yen
(Economic and Financial Analyst) of the Infrastructure Division, China and Mongolia
Department of the East Asia and Pacific Region and reviewed by Messrs. Richard Scurfield
(Chief, EA2IN) and Juergen Voegele (Acting Project Adviser, EA2DR). The Borrower provided
comments that are included as appendices. A separate ICR has been prepared for the Ningbo
Port.
Preparation of this ICR began just before the project closing date and was based on
material in the project file. The Borrower contributed to the ICR by evaluating the project's
execution and initial preparation.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
NINGBO AND SHANGHAI PORT PROJECT: SHANGHAI PORT
(LOAN 30061-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.    The project's main short-term objectives were to help the port of Shanghai increase its
cargo handling capacity and efficiency. This was to be achieved by: (a) providing wharves and
equipment for two general purpose terminals (Baoshan and Guangang) and a coal terminal
(Zhujiamen) which was under construction, and (b) rehabilitating, equipping and expanding the
Minsheng grain terminal.  Most importantly, it would establish a long-term strategy for
developing the port, so that it could meet the region's large and growing transport needs. To this
end, a panel of experts from the Shanghai Port Authority (SPA) reviewed the port's Master Plan.
Also, a study was conducted to develop a costing and management information system (PCMIS)
that would reflect actual costs and identify areas that could achieve greater efficiencies.
2.    When the project was identif.ed in the mid-1980s, most Chinese ports were badly
congested and container berths, bulk cargo berths, port equipment, storage yards and transport
infrastructure (for distribution), were in short supply. Indeed, it appeared that congestion would
threaten the expansion of China's foreign trade. Shanghai Port, the country's largest and
gateway to eastern and central China, was particularly important because it anticipated even
faster growth than the others. The port is connected by rail, roads and the Changjiang River and
other waterways to the inland region; the largest proportion of cargo (70 percent) is carried
inland by the waterways.
3.    The Ministry of Communications (MOC) began to decentralize the ports in January 1986.
As a result, they began to finance their own development and investments and compete with
other ports for cargo.
Implementation Experience and Results
4.    The project was completed satisfactorily by December 31, 1995. The closing date was
extended for two years since procurement of the Bank-financed equipment for Minsheng grain
terminal was delayed: Preparing the engineering design for the grain-handling system was
complex and longer than anticipated.
5.    Despite the delay, project implementation was satisfactory because all objectives were
achieved. Managers and workers of the SPA received extensive training, and operational and
maintenance capacity was improved [para. 10(d)]. The experts' review of the Master Plan



- v -
provided a sound basis for future development, and their recommendations were incorporated in
a subsequent Bank project (the Shanghai Port Restructuring and Development Project-Loan
3552-CHA) [para. 10(b)]. An action plan was introduced that improved the port's operations
[para. 10(c)], and physical capacity was substantially increased with the construction of
container/multipurpose berths and a coal berth. These accomplishments were partly due to the
fact that project design was relatively straightforward and the lack of complexity of most project
components and to the coordination between SPA and the Ministry of Communications (MOC),
which has overall responsibility for the port sector.
6.    Bid evaluations, a two-step process involving SPA and a central evaluation committee,
took a considerable period of time: five months for the relatively simple equipment, and 1 1
months for the more complex equipment for the Minsheng grain terminal. This delay occurred
because the evaluation report provided by the Borrower was incomplete and took an additional
10 months to clarify (para. 9).
7.    Project benefits were obtained from savings in: (a) cargo-handling costs, (b) ship waiting
and berthing time, and (c) cargo time. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was
estimated at 22.6 percent against 18.2 percent in the SAR, which is considered satisfactory (para.
32).
8.    Cost estimates at appraisal were slightly lower than actual costs (about 7 percent). The
final cost was estimated at about $281.6 million (or Y 1,058.9 million plus $47.6 million) against
$264.3 million (or Y 825.6 million plus $47.6 million) at appraisal (para. 15). The local currency
increase was due to higher than expected inflation during implementation and higher cost for
procurement of equipment.
9.    SPA's financial performance is acceptable.  The operational ratio (operating costs/
revtl Aes) was higher than estimated in the SAR (59.5 percent against 46.8 percent in 1993) due
to sharp domestic price increases (inflation) and reduced grain-related revenues while the
Minsheng grain terminal was being improved under the project. SPA compensated for this by
increasing efficiency and the volume of container traffic handled. Since inflation seems to have
stabilized, container traffic will most likely expand further, grain-handling revenues will rebound
strongly, and an upcoming revaluation of the port's fixed assets should positively affect financial
results, and SPA's financial condition should remain acceptable.  This notwithstanding,
Shanghai, like all of China's ports, would benefit from a revision of the current policy of setting
port tariffs by the central government, with inadequate provision for matching tariffs to operating
costs.
10.   No environmental or resettlement problems arose during implementation.



- vi -
Sustainability
11.   At completion, the project appeared sustainable. Because container and grain traffic will
undoubtedly grow along with rapid economic development in the Shanghai area, the port's
revenue will increase. In addition, SPA has enough resources to maintain and operate the port
efficiently. To further improve the container terminals' productivity, SPA established a joint
venture company (the Shanghai Container Terminal Limited-SCT) in August 1993 with an
experienced container operating company in Hong Kong (Hong Kong International Terminal-
HIT). As yet, it is too soon to evaluate its effectiveness. In order to strengthen its financial
viability, SPA will need to review its finances. For the future, the market-oriented reforms being
introduced gradually at the port should be expanded to include cost-based tariffs, identification of
more sources of long-term financing, introduction of measures to increase liquidity, and
continued commercialization of port operations. These actions will be needed to allow the port
to continue to improve its operating and financial performance, in keeping with its vital role in
the area's (and China's) economy. The PCMIS, developed under the project, could be used to
identify areas to be improved.
Findings and Lessons Learned
12.   Findings and lessons include the following:
(a)   Under the project, SPA capably constructed facilities, procured equipment, carried
out studies and developed its organization;
(b)   Project design was relatively straightforward, which helped eliminate the problem
of coordinating various agencies;
(c)   The bid evaluation report, which took considerable time to complete, could have
been finalized more quickly if it had provided more detailed information about the
bidders' technical deviations to expedite the Bank's review (para. 9);
(d)   Forming a joint venture with an experienced terminal operator (SCT) improved
productivity and brought modem management techniques to container operations
(para. 13); and
(e)   Because SPA's operating ratio is increasing, it should focus on: (i) reforming
tariffs, (ii) reducing operating costs and increasing the degree of liquidity,
(iii) shifting from short- to long-term loans to finance long-term investments,
(iv) gaining Government agreement to reform the port's tax obligations, and
(v) transferring its nonport-related services to other agencies (para. 27).

CHINA
NINGBO AND SHANGHAI PORTS PROJECT: SHANGHAI PORT
(LOAN 30061-CHA)
PART I. IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    When the project was identified in the mid-1980s, most Chinese ports were badly
congested and container berths, bulk cargo berths, port equipment, storage yards and transport
infrastructure (for distribution) were in short supply. Indeed, it appeared that congestion would
threaten the expansion of China's foreign trade. As Shanghai is the largest port in the country
and gateway to eastern and central China, the problem was considered severe-not only for
Shanghai, but the inland areas, as well.
2.    To remedy the sectoral constraints, the Government had begun to reforn the ports in
1986, including a shift to self-financing of port operations and investments from internal cash
generation, and to increasing competition among ports for cargo.
3.    The project's main objectives were to help Shanghai Port increase its cargo handling
capacity and efficiency in the short term and devise a sound long-term strategy for it to serve the
large and growing transport needs of the hinterland. Project components included the following:
(a)   Constructing a multipurpose terninal at Baoshan, consisting of eight berths, three
of which were designed to handle containers;
(b)   Constructing an eight-berth general-cargo terminal at Guangang;
(c)   Constructing two coal handling berths at Zhujiamen;
(d)   Reconstructing and rehabilitating four berths at the Minsheng grain terminal;
(e)   Constructing an 80,000-ton capacity grain silo;
(f)   Acquiring cargo handling equipment for (a), (b), (c) and (d) above, including
container cranes for the Baoshan terminal and bulk coal and grain handling
equipment for the Zhujiamen and Minsheng terminals, respectively;



(g)   Conducting a study to develop a port costing and management information system
(PCMIS) to enable China's ports to monitor costs and introduce a more rational,
cost-based tariff structure;
(h)   Establishing a panel of experts to review a Port Master Plan prepared by the
Shanghai Port Authority (SPA), formerly known as the Shanghai Harbor Bureau;
and
(i)   Adopting various measures to improve the port's efficiency and safety, based on
an action plan.
B. ACHIEVEMENTS OF OBJECTIVES
Project Implementation
4.    This was the fifth Bank-assisted port project in China, following the Three Ports Project,
Tianjin Port Project, Huangpu Port Project, and Dalian Port Project (Table 2). It was the second
Bank project for Shanghai port, after the Three Ports Project, and was followed by the Shanghai
Port Restructuring and Development Project (Ln. 3552-CHA).
5.    Civil works. Local contractors constructed the four terminals-Baoshan, Guangang,
Zhujiamen, and Minsheng-with local funds. Procurement for the Minsheng terminal, which
was originally slated for international competitive bidding (ICB) with Bank financing, was
accomplished with local financing and procedures; SPA preferred to use local funds to expedite
the construction.
6.    The Capital Construction Division of SPA supervised the construction (use of an internal
department for this function was a common practice at that time). Construction of the four berths
was satisfactory, and the Ministry of Communications (MOC) evaluated the quality as excellent.
7.    Procurement of equipment.  Procurement was carried out through ICB, limited
international competitive bidding (LIB), local competitive bidding (LCB) and shopping
procedures. Major equipment was procured through ICB (99 percent of the total amount
allocated for Category 2-goods). The first ICB package included equipment for Baoshan,
Zhujiamen and Guangang, and the second was for Minsheng.
8.    The evaluation was performed in two stages (common in Bank-financed port projects):
One, at the regional level, was by SPA; the other, at the central level, was by the State Evaluation
Committee. It took from five to 11 months to finalize the bid evaluation report (Table 5C). This
rather prolonged evaluation period was due to the complexity and many types of equipment
included in the package.
9.    The contract award was further delayed because the evaluation report for the Minsheng
grain terminal was incomplete. It provided only limited information on the commercial/technical



- 3 -
deviations of bidders, which were evaluated as nonresponsive. The Bank's review could have
been completed earlier if the evaluation report had provided detailed and solid basis of
deviations.
10.   Technical Assistance (TA) and Training. These involved: (a) a study to develop a port
costing and management information system, (b) review of the Master Plan by a panel of experts,
(c) implementation of the action plan for operational improvements, and (d) training. TA and
training were satisfactorily implemented and completed.
(a)   The PCMIS study was carried out by foreign and domestic consultants, along with
representatives from the ports, under the leadership of MOC and the Ministry of
Finance (MOF). The first phase (identifying the tariff and management structure
at Shanghai, Ningbo, Dalian and Xiamen ports) was carried out by foreign
consultants during 1990-91. The second phase (determining the ports' needs,
financed with local funds), was carried out by a domestic team organized by the
related agencies in 1991-92. The third and fourth phases (developing and
applying software, and installing the system) were carried out by foreign
consultants, domestic consultants (from MOF) and the domestic team during
1993-95. Representatives from the four ports, MOC and MOF were trained in
Belgium. Software was installed at eight ports (the four mentioned above, plus
Nanjing, Dandong, Yantai, and Yinkou), after October 1994. The final domestic
team meeting was held at Dalian on December 4-5, 1995 to evaluate the PCMIS
study; participants concluded the study was successful. The software system was
adopted by all stevedoring companies at Dalian, Nanjing and Yinkou ports, and
by selected companies at Shanghai and Ningbo ports. Other ports, such as Tianjin
and Zhanjiang, expect to install the system soon, and MOC plans to expand it to
other ports in the future.
(b)   The Master Plan, which was originally produced by SPA, was finalized by a panel
of experts (which included five foreigners). It provided a sound basis for
developing a long-term strategy and concluded that much of the port activity
should shift from the city center to an area on the periphery. This course of action
was adopted in the Shanghai Port Restructuring and Development Project, which
is now being implemented (following the recommendation in the Master Plan).
(c)   The action plan for operations and maintenance-which included five elements to
improve operations and two to improve maintenance-was successfully carried
out (see Table 6).
(i)    Operations. The goal of reducing ship delays was achieved-dropping
from 0.94 days per vessel in 1989 to 0.07 days per vessel in 1994; new
container handling equipment was obtained and some items were
modernized;



- 4 -
(ii)    Maintenance.  MOC guidelines were strictly followed and periodic
inspections were carried out for civil works; obsolete equipment is being
replaced with funds from Ln. 3552-CHA.
(d)   SPA conducted extensive overseas and domestic training for staff at four
terminals in modem port operations and environmental protection beyond what
was planned in the SAR: for overseas training, 298 person-months against 120
person-months; for domestic training, 4,301 staff against 3,200 staff (see Table
5B). To conduct the training, SPA used foreign experts in Shanghai. It supported
the effort with its own funds and those from other ports, and bilateral grants. In
addition, it is training staff under the Bank loan 3552-CHA.
11.   Private sector involvement. During implementation, a joint venture company, the
Shanghai Container Terminal Ltd. (SCT), was created by SPA's Shanghai Container
Development Company and a private investor, the Hong Kong International Terminal (HIT), to
operate container terminals at Shanghai. This was the first joint venture involving a private
investor for operating containers in the major ports in China. SPA applied some of its assets to
acquire a 50 percent share in the company.
12.   SCT improved operational efficiency: The average ship berthing time dropped from 1.35
days in 1990 to 0.62 days in 1995, and nonproductive time also decreased from 0.24 days to 0.06
days; container traffic increased from 4.5 million tons and 1,027 ships to 11.7 million tons and
3,284 ships, respectively, in the same period.
Project Results
13.   All project objectives were achieved during implementation:
(a)   SPA's operational and maintenance capabilities were improved, as the targets in
the action plan were achieved;
(b)   A sound basis for the port's long-term development was provided by the Port
Master Plan and the PCMIS study; and
(c)   Efficiency was improved, particularly in container operations, with the formation
of SCT, a joint venture company.
14.   Benefits were achieved through savings in: (a) cargo-handling costs, (b) ship waiting and
berthing time, and (c) cargo time. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at
22.6 percent against the 18.2 percent in the SAR, which is considered satisfactory.
15.   Cost estimates at appraisal were slightly lower than actual (about 7 percent). Final
project costs were estimated at about $281.6 million (or Y 1,058.9 million plus $47.6 million)
against $264.3 million (or Y 825.9 million plus $47.6 million) at appraisal. The local currency



-5 -
increase was due to local price hikes during implementation and higher cost for procurement of
equipment, in particular, for the Minsheng grain terminal.
16.   No environmental or resettlement problems arose during implementation.
Financial Performance
17.   Major financial reforms.  Some major changes occurred after project preparation and
during implementation that affected SPA's financial condition and reporting procedures. These
included the following:
(a)   Decentralization. From 1986 onwards, some of the major ports' management and
financial functions were decentralized from the State (MOC) to the municipalities.
Port authorities assumed responsibility for the day-to-day management, operational,
budgetary, construction and development functions, although MOC still approves
major projects and plans affecting the ports' long-term development. However, the
ports now bear the financial obligations for any loans they obtain. For this reason,
the Government has reduced the tax they previously paid and instead requires them
to pay a lower annual flat fee (which enhanced their internal cash generation). This
arrangement still continues.
The key financial terms of the port's financial and management included the
following: Rehabilitation projects of over Y 30 million needed State approval;
annual income tax payments to the State were replaced by an annual lump-sum
payment of Y 51.55 million; and the port also paid a flat annual fee of Y 20 million
to an energy and transport fund and Y 1.0 million for construction and other taxes.
During 1993-95, the total annual tax payments were recalculated to one single
payment of Y 35.0 million.
(b)   New Financial Reporting Procedures. Beginning in July 1993, under MOF's
instructions, SPA adopted new financial reporting procedures in order to align
Chinese accounting procedure more closely to the Western accounting system. The
purpose of the new system is to accelerate the port's commercialization and
privatization by providing Western accounting instruments.
(c)   Revaluation of Fixed Assets (RFA). The port had two RFAs. The initial one, in
1992, was the first of its kind in more than 40 years and was carried out
cautiously-confined to the five major types of handling equipment. Its impact was
limited and only increased the value of fixed assets by about 13 percent, or Y 423.8
million. In the second RFA, in 1994, the value of fixed assets increased by about 10
percent, or Y 345.6 million.

(d)   Joint venture operations. In August 1993, SPA formed a container handling
company (SCT), using part of its existing assets to acquire 50 percent of the
company. SCT now plays a dominant role in the port's container operations, and in
1994, handled more than 90 percent of this traffic.
18.   Past financial performance. Despite an operating ratio from 1986 to 1994 that was higher
and net profit after taxes that was lower than SAR estimates, SPA's financial performance is still
acceptable. The volume of traffic handled in 1993 (the last available forecast year in the SAR) was
112.6 million tons, which was about 3 percent higher than the appraisal estimate (109.6 million
tons). Its net profit after taxes in 1993, however, was only Y 222.0 million (against a forecast of
Y 456.8 million). Traffic volume remained the same, but revenue increased by an average of 24.0
percent a year. The main reason for the lower net profit was the rapid increase in average operating
costs of about 30.5 percent a year (against 10.2 percent projected in the SAR).
19.   The SAR's conservative financial forecasts were developed when the State strictly set tariff
and price controls for almost every major commodity. As a result, cost increases and inflation were
rare. In addition, the Government subsidized the cost of many commodities during the previous
three decades (including cargo) and charged users only the planned prices. Thus, at the time the
SAR was written, it was assumed that: (a) real port charges would remain virtually constant and
(b) the rate of inflation would be low (from 4.6 to 6.5 percent during 1986-93). Although
reasonable at the time, these assumptions now appear very low due to much higher than expected
inflation.
20.   Although unit tariffs rose during 1986-93 by an average of 20.3 percent per year, they were
not high enough to cover increased unit operating costs, which rose by 26.7 percent a year (against
7.3 percent projected in the SAR). Also, the higher depreciation (from the RFA) caused operating
costs to rise. In addition, because the container operation at Shanghai-the most profitable cargo-
handling item at the port-was transformed into a joint venture, the port only obtained half the
profits (although the teu handled rose by about 28 percent in 1994).
21.   Highlights of SPA's income statements for selected years, as compared with the SAR
forecast, along with the latest financial data, are summarized below (see Table Sl.1, Annex 1 for
details.

22.    Actual operating ratios were higher than the SAR targets (59.5 percent against 46.8 percent,
for 1993), and are expected to reach 65 percent for 1995. This was due to a rapid rise in costs and
other expenditures, as well as a downturn in grain-handling revenues while the grain terminal was
being improved under the project.
23.    In 1993, the rate of return on average net fixed assets (RRFA) was 14 percent (21.3 percent
projected in the SAR). In 1994, it dropped to 13 percent, due to the rapid increase in operating
costs and the higher fixed assets because of the asset revaluation. For 1995, the RRFA was
expected to drop further to about 7 percent, due to reduced traffic volume and added hikes in
operating costs.
24.    Present Financial Performance. Despite rising operating costs for the last few years, the
port's financial condition is acceptable, but warrants action if it is to remain so. Debt service (DS)
was 2.9 (33.3 forecast in the SAR) in 1993, which was still good, and further improved to 4.4 in
1995. The debt and capital ratios of the port in 1993 reached 19.2 percent (9.0 percent forecast in
the SAR), rising from 7.4 percent in 1986. The increased borrowing reflected the port's financial
condition of being asset rich and cash poor, with current liabilities much larger than long-term
liabilities. To improve this situation, the port should borrow long-term loans to finance long-term
investments. During 1986-94, the share of accounts receivable increased from 13.4 percent to 37.9
percent. The current ratio in 1994 was at the marginal level of 1.0 (if the current ratio is less than



- 8 -
1.0, the port has short-term solvency problems and needs to strengthen its finances). This situation
would be substantially improved if SPA follows the recommendations listed in para. 27.

26.    Future Financial Performance. In recent years, the increase in operating costs and current
liabilities and declining traffic (due to competition among the ports) caused liquidity problems;
however, with moderating inflation, rebounding grain revenues with completion of the grain
terminal, and other positive developments, the port's financial condition is expected to improve.
27.    There are still a few areas in which SPA can improve its financial condition. After the
decentralization, the port's new responsibility for self-financing all its capital investments has
created pressure on its cash flow (Table S1.3, Annex 1). MOF provided, in return, the preferential
financial agreement (the flat annual payment) with SPA which expired in 1995. SPA should
negotiate with MOF for streamlining tax payments, in view of its obligation to self-finance
investments. Furthermore, SPA should address the following:
(a)    Tariffs. The standard tariff schedule is set by the Central Government and applies
to all ports nationwide. It is recommended that the port authority be allowed a
certain range of flexibility to determine its own tariffs. The basic principles would
be to: (i) cover operating costs; (ii) strengthen the port's finances; and (iii)
encourage the port authority to compete with nearby ports by providing better
service.



-9-
(b)    Degree of liquidity. Shorter operating cycles (OC) reduce the amount of cash that
ports need to operate (the OC is the time needed to collect accounts receivable plus
the turnover time of inventory). At Shanghai, the OC has steadily increased: For
example, it was 107.1 days in 1986, 192.3 days in 1994 and expected to be 240.2
days in 1995. This reflects prolonged accounts receivable (essentially an interest
free loan for the buyers) and increased inventory (which results in higher operating
costs), which will drain the port of its cash. Thus, the OC period should be
shortened, as this would generate vitally needed cash and improve the port's
liquidity. Any nonperforming account receivable should be written off.
(days)                                 1986         1994         1995
(Actual)               (Estimates)
Average number of days required to:
(a) collect accounts receivable (AR)     21.4       100.0        116.1
(b) sell inventory                       85.7        92.3        124.1
Operating Cycle (OC)                 107.1       192.3        240.2
(c)    Structure of borrowing.  In recent years (1992-94), current liabilities were
increased by more than three and a half times due to the rapid increase in borrowing,
to pay for the port's construction. This is an unsatisfactory policy, and the port
authority should borrow long-termn loans to finance long-term investments.
(d)    Services reforms. Some welfare or social activities not directly related to the port's
daily operations, such as schools and hospitals, should be transferred to local
municipal agencies, along with their operating costs.
Economic Reevaluation
28.   The economic analysis in this report is based on the reevaluation of SAR estimates on
traffic, operational performance, economic costs and the benefits of project components. The
methodology used in the ICR is similar to that in the SAR and is summarized as follows:
(a)    Capital investment and maintenance costs were revised to reflect December 1995
prices and included in the cost stream;
(b)    The benefit stream, also reflected in December 1995 prices, was included and
consists of savings in port handling, ship port time (berth and waiting), and cargo
port time (berth and waiting);



- 10-
(c)   A project life of 20 years was assumed, with capital investments for all berths being
made from 1986 to 1995; and
(d)   Benefits started to accrue for the two coal berths, three container berths and 11
general cargo in 1993. For the two grain berths, benefits started in 1996.
29.   Use of the berths changed during project implementation because the composition of the
traffic changed. While container traffic was much higher than the SAR estimate, growth of timber
traffic was much slower. Thus, SPA converted a timber berth and a multipurpose berth into two
container berths. This conversion was considered in the ICR economic analysis.
30.   Total traffic handled by the port in 1994 was lower than expected (largely because coal
traffic was reduced), although traffic handled by the project berths was similar to the SAR
projection: The decreased coal and grain traffic was completely offset by the better-than-expected
container and general cargo traffic, which constitute 47.7 percent of total traffic and 81 percent of
benefits.
31.   After assessing the revised data, the revaluation of the economic internal rate of return
(REIRR) is 22.6 percent, which is slightly higher than the SAR estimate of 18.2 percent. A detailed
analysis is presented in Annex 2.
32.   The REIRR and the SAR estimates in terms of the economic rate of return and the net
present value (NPV) are given below.

la Y 678.4 million in July 1988 prices were inflated by the factor of 1.9151 to reflect December
1995 prices.
C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
33.   Positive influences included:
(a)   A rapidly developing local and national economy that increased port traffic
(particularly container traffic);
(b)   The Borrower's experience in implementing projects, including the Bank-
financed project; and
(c)   A close working relationship between the Borrower and Bank.



34.   Negative factors included:
(a)   Price hikes during implementation that increased project costs slightly and port
operating costs significantly; and
(b)   A complex coordination of the civil works construction and procurement of
equipment (Minsheng grain terminal) which was not properly considered in the
implementation program.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
35.   At completion, the project appeared sustainable.  Because container traffic will
undoubtedly grow along with rapid economic development in the Shanghai area, the port's
revenue will increase. In November 1992, SPA established a joint venture company, the
Shanghai Container Terminal Limited (SCT), with an experienced foreign container operator that
will further improve the productivity of the container terminals. In addition, SPA has enough
resources to maintain and operate the port efficiently. Risks still exist, such as SCT's monopoly
and excess labor at the container terminals. SPA management should also closely review the
port's financial situation and identify areas that can be improved by using PCMIS.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
36.   The Bank identified the issues and prepared the project well and in a timely fashion: It
was identified in April 1987 and appraised in March 1988. Bank staff resources leading to
appraisal totaled 120.5 staff-weeks for the Ningbo and Shanghai Ports Project. Bank supervision
was also efficient: The annual average input of staff resources was 17.5 staff-weeks combined
with the Ningbo Port Project, which included various specialties (see Table 12). This was
possible because the supervision of six Bank-financed port projects was well coordinated.
37.   With regard to procurement, the Bank took a consistent position and provided guidance,
when necessary.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
38.  In general, the Borrower's performance was good and preparation and implementation
were adequate. Action plan targets were substantially met during implementation, and as shown
in Table 10, Part II, covenants were met, as well. The Borrower's performance, therefore, was
evaluated as satisfactory.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
39.   This project is assessed as satisfactory because it achieved all major objectives without
any major shortcomings. It was not assessed highly satisfactory, because completion was
delayed for two years.



- 12 -
40.   Net present value was positive, Y 1,676 million against Y 725 million in the SAR, when
flows were discounted at 12 percent for a major portion of the investment.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
41.   Based on the port's Master Plan, SPA plans to develop a port facility along the Yangtze
River and Hangzhou Bay (Jinshanzui). For the areas of interest to foreign private investors, such
as container terminal development, it is likely that SPA will seek partnerships. With regard to
the deepening of the Channel, which is one of the most critical issues for Shanghai Port
development, but may not attract private investors, Shanghai city, together with MOC, has
proposed that the Government approve a publicly funded project to deepen the mouth of the
Yangtze up to 12.5 m in three phases: (a) 7 m to 8.5 m, (b) then to 10 m, and (c) finally, to 12.5
m. Although the project's finances would not be linked to SPA, the project will directly affect
the port's development. Thus, SPA should closely watch its evolution and revise its Master Plan,
accordingly.
I. FINDINGS AND LESSONS LEARNED
42.   The findings and key lessons from project implementation include:
(a)   SPA capably constructed facilities, procured equipment, carried out studies and
developed its organization;
(b)   Project design was relatively straightforward, which helped eliminate the problem
of coordinating various agencies;
(c)   The bid evaluation report, which took considerable time to complete, could have
been finalized more quickly if it had provided more detailed information about the
bidders' technical deviations;
(d)   Forming a joint venture with an experienced terminal operator (SCT) improved
productivity and brought modem management techniques to container operations;
and
(e)   Even though SPA's financial performance is in an acceptable range, SPA should
focus on and discuss with the relevant Government agencies the following, since
its cash flow is gradually deteriorating:  (i) reforming tariffs, (ii) reducing
operating costs, (iii) shifting to long-term loans to finance long-term investments,
(iv) transferring its nonport-related services to other agencies.
43.   Since this is the sixth completion report (after two Project Completion Reports for Three
Ports Project and Dalian Port, and three ICRs for Tianjin, Huangpu and Xiamen Ports) for
Chinese port projects approved in 1980s, it is worth summarizing findings and lessons learned
from these projects as shown below:



- 13 -
(a)   Decentralization of the ports has been satisfactory; this was proven by the
operational and financial performance of the port authorities;
(b)   Involvement of the private sector has been initiated, but is still limited, in
container terminal operation (it is already established in Shanghai and Dalian, and
being prepared/planned in Xiamen and Ningbo);
(c)    Simple project designs and clear implementation targets with a single executing
agency were the key for successful implementation of the projects;
(d)   The major reason for implementation delays was procurement, due to long
evaluation periods; in order to avoid confusion in the evaluation period:
(i) postqualification criteria should clearly be provided in bidding documents;
(ii) an evaluation report should provide clear and sufficient reasons for
nonresponsiveness, if the lowest bidder is not proposed to be awarded; and
sufficient time should be reserved for the procurement process; and
(e)    The provision of an action plan for operational improvement in SARs was
effective for supervision and implementation of the project; productivity was
improved through implementation of action plans (Huangpu, Xiamen, Shanghai
and Ningbo).
44.   For future port development, the following changes are suggested:
(a)    The port tariff is largely regulated by the State and not based on the actual
operating cost; this should be corrected;
(b)   Competition is the key factor for operational improvement; since many ports
enjoy a monopoly condition, it is important to introduce the concept of
competition among the terminal operators; and
(c)    Some nonport activities such as schools and hospitals should be transferred from
port authorities to local agencies.

TABLE 7: STUDIES INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT
1.    Port Costing and Management Information System (PCMIS) Study
(a)   Purpose as defined at appraisal
The study was to provide China's ports with a computer-based commercial accounting
system which captures fully the capital and operating costs of the port, disaggregated to a
sufficiently detailed set of cost centers to allow effective management control over costs.
(b)   Status
Satisfactorily completed in December 1995.
(c)   Impact of study
Computer software was installed at (i) all stevedoring companies in Dalian, Nanjing and
Yinkou ports, (ii) three stevedoring companies and the port authority in Ningbo port; and (i) one
terminal (No. 9 company) in Shanghai port. Tianjin and Zhanjiang ports are planning to install
software.
2.    Review of the Master Plan of the Port by a Panel of Experts
(a)   Purpose as defined at appraisal
The panel of experts established and chaired jointly by the SPA and Bank reviewed
SPA's master plan for the port. Given the magnitude of the investment to be made and far-
reaching consequences for Shanghai and its interior, the review was agreed upon by SPA and the
Bank, during appraisal.
(b)   Status
The panel met five times from September 1988 to March 1990 and finalized the plan.
(c)   Impact of the study
The first step of the master plan has been implemented under the Bank-financed Shanghai
Port Restructuring and Development Project (Ln. 3552-CHA), since 1992.

APPENDIX B: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
Section A
1.    The project of construction of Guangang, Baoshan and Zhujiamen harbor districts and
reconstruction of Minsheng bulk grain terminal in Shanghai, China which was implemented by
Shanghai Port Authority (Ln. 30061-CHA) has a total loan amount of $4.64 million. The loan
was all used for procurement of equipment which has been completed through ICB, following
the Bank's guidelines.
2.    The construction of Baoshan new harbor district was started in July 1986, completed in
December 1990, and put into use in 1991. The construction of Guangang new harbor district was
started in July 1987, completed in December 1990, and put into use in 1991. The civil
construction of Zhujiamen was started in October 1986, completed in July 1989 and put into
operation in 1990. The three terminals have all been accepted by the State and the quality was
evaluated as excellent. The rehabilitation of Minsheng terminal was started in December 1991
and completed in 1995. The terminal is expected to be formally accepted and operational in the
first half of 1996. The above four terminals consisted of 20 berths of 10,000 DWT class, with a
total capacity increase of 11.6 million tons. The 140 pieces of equipment financed by the Bank
loan for Baoshan, Guangang and Zhujiamen terminals were procured through ICB started in
1989 and completed in December 1993. The procurement through ICB of two shipunloaders and
one transportation system financed by the loan for Minsheng terminal was started in 1992 and
finished in December 1995.
3.    The project is reasonable in general layout, handling technology and quay structure type.
The equipment parameters are reliable and with a higher automation of technological process. In
general, project objectives are achieved, and the project is a success. It has greatly expanded
cargo traffic capacity of the port. Statistics show that since the operation of Guangang, Baoshan
and Zhujiamen, the volume of cargo handled by these three terminals added up to 53.59 million
tons by the end of 1995.
4.    Procurement of equipment was carried out through international competitive bidding,
which had a benefit cost reduction of some equipment and improvement in handling technology
of Minsheng terminal. Some technical personnel were also trained. The construction of new
terminals and increase of necessary equipment have enlarged the handling capacity and meet the
requirement of transportation growth.
5.    The development under this project consisted of two coal berths, three container berths,
two bulk grain berths, 13 general cargo berths and necessary handling equipment, totaling 20



- 30 -                   Appendix B
berths of 10,000 DWT class. The increase of berths has enhanced the comprehensive capacity
and function and benefited the increase of port traffic. The port of Shanghai handled total 165
million tons of cargo in 1995.
6.    The project also included a technical assistance project which was financed by Technical
Cooperation Credit (TCC) for inviting an expert panel (approved by the Bank) to review the
master plan for the port of Shianglhai. The work was finished in 1990, and the review report not
only helped lay the basis for development under No. 3 project of SPA (Ln. 3552-CHA) also had
a referential value for planning restructuring of the port.
7.    Particular attention was given to environmental protection and safety construction of the
four terminals. During the project implementation, environmental protection facilities such as
sewage treatment and dust prevention were equipped in accordance with the related regulation of
the State. The inspections made by the local environmental protection agency showed the results
were satisfactory.
8.    Procurement of the equipment through ICB was executed by a working team which
comprised experienced technical personnel from relevant departments of SPA. They are familiar
with the World Bank's Guidelines and have a good knowledge of English and rich project
management experience. Therefore, the project was executed satisfactorily. They also applied
their experience obtained from the ICB items to LCB items.
9.    The project design of Baoshan, Guangang and Zhujiamen were basically undertaken by
the Chinese design institute, i.e., the Third Harbor Engineering Investigation and Design Institute
of MOC, and the project design of Minsheng was undertaken by the Second Harbor Engineering
Investigation and Design Institute of MOC. In general, the design is a success. The design
institutes made a great effoil to ensure the satisfactory execution of the project.
10.   Technical documents for procurement of equipment were jointly prepared by Shanghai
Port Authority and end-users. Some reliable and advanced techniques which fully complied with
actual location situations were incorporated in the detailed technical specification. Practice has
proven that the tendering work was successful. The procurement of equipment has strictly
followed the contents stated in SAR and all the equipment was manufactured and delivered
according to requirements of the contracts.
11.   The closing date of the project was originally December 31, 1993 and was extended to
December 31, 1995 as approved by Bank's fax dated October 8, 1993. The main reason for the
two-year extension was that the review of draft technical specifications for procurement of
equipment took some time, and the bid evaluation report was reviewed several times by the local
and the Bank until it was finally approved. It took about 22 months from bid opening till the
signing of contract which resulted in a comparatively long for procurement of equipment.

Section B
12.   The ICR drafted by the World Bank is comprehensive. It describes completely all the
major items of the project executed and analysis provided is correct and complies with the actual
conditions.
13.   With respect to the data of each item in the ICR, we acknowledge that they are correct
and conform to the actual situation.
14.   With regard to the reason for the two-year extension of closing date, we agree with what
is stated in the ICR, i.e., the closing date was extended due to delay in procurement equipment
for Minsheng terminal.
Section C
15.   From the project appraisal to the reimbursement deadline, the World Bank was very
positive and effective. Shanghai Port Authority appreciates all officials and experts from the
Bank who participated in this project for their efforts and contributions made to the port
development. It gave us deep impression of their strong sense of serious responsibility, scientific
way in management and spirit of job respect.
16.   During the whole implementation period, we have kept close cooperation and mutual
respect with the relative departments of the Bank, especially the guidance on all aspects granted
by the Bank's experts.  Shanghai Port Authority overcame various difficulties in project
implementation and completed the project satisfactorily.
17.   Each site supervision mission from the World Bank made a significant effect on the
project execution.  They inspected the site situation and collected first-hand information,
resolved problems that occurred during construction and accelerated the construction procedure
by strengthening a mutual understanding and trust. The Bank's mission gave us great support on
reallocation of loan and extension of closing date.  The Bank officers' instructions,
understanding and quick responses to our requests facilitated the project implementation.

ANNEX 2: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. The Port and Traffic
1.        Shanghai port is the most important port in China and one of the largest in the world.  It
is located on the Huangpu River, about 90 km upstream of its confluence with the Yangtze River
and close to the East China Sea. In 1994, the port authority handled 98.9 million tons of cargo or
about 25 percent less than the SAR forecast of 132.3 million ton. The cargo handled by the
project berths, in 1994, however, was quite similar to the SAR's projection, 82.10 million tons
and 89.25 million tons, respectively (only about 8.0 percent difference). In addition, the cargo
handled by the project berths, in 1986, constituted 65.7 percent of total port traffic. This ratio
increased to 83.0 percent in 1994.
2.        The average annual traffic growth rate at the project berths during  1986-94  was much
faster than overall growth at the port (3.1 percent vs 0.2 percent). Total SPA traffic and that for
the project berths, shown in Table S2.1, are summarized as follows.

3.    The economic recession in early 1990s struck this area severely, and port traffic has
stagnated ever since. However, based on the area's economic activities (the special economic
zone is adjacent to the port) and the long-term development plans (the State has decided to
implement the Pudong Comprehensive Economic Development Plan and the proposed deepening
of the approach channel at the mouth of Yangtze River for larger ships is in progress), the growth
of port traffic for the next two and a half decades (1995-2020) is estimated to be approximately
2.9 percent per year.
B. Ship Time Analysis
4.    General Cargo Carriers (for break bulk cargoes):   Comparing 1990 (without the
project) to 1994 (with the project), each general cargo carrier spent an average of 3.7 days and
2.8 days, respectively, in the port, of which the ship waiting time in the port (nonproductive
time) decreased from 1.87 days to 1.37 days. During the same period, the average working time
per ship (unit productive time at berth) also decreased from 1.5 days to 1.1 days, while the
average shipment per vessel increased from 12,000 tons/ship to 15,000 tons/ship due to improved
handling procedures.
5.    Container Carriers: Despite the increase in container traffic by an average of 24.1
percent per year (in tonnage) from 1990 to 1994, the average total ship days spent in port per
ship decreased from 1.35 days to 0.62 days. The average productive time needed to unload per
ship decreased from 0.35 days to 0.28 days. The new equipment not only improved the
efficiency but also maximized the availability of the equipment. The nonproductive time (due to
the port), for example, decreased from 0.24 days per ship to 0.06 days per ship, while total
number of container vessels calling at the port increased 2.7 times. Thus, without the project, the
added traffic demand would have lengthened the ship waiting time (Table S2.2).
6.    Coal Ships:  Coal traffic is the biggest single item handled at SPA. In 1994, it
constituted about 40 percent of the port's total freight traffic. Any slight improvement in coal
handling will mean a large saving for the cargo and ship owners. In the last four years (1990-
94), all the indicators showed that the handling of coal traffic improved, such as productive time
at berth (from 0.46 days to 0.38 days), nonproductive time due to the port (from 0.07 days to
0.02 days) as well as the total ship port days (from 0.73 days to 0.60 days).
7.    Grain Ships: Ship time in port for grain ships deteriorated since 1990 due to the lack of
adequate facilities to handle the traffic. The situation will not improve until 1996, the first year
the new grain terminal will operate. Currently, the average grain ship stay in port is 3.87 days. It
is expected that it will be reduced to under two days after the opening of the new grain facilities.

C. Berth Operations
8.    Operating data for general cargo, container coal and grain berths at the port also differ
somewhat from the SAR estimates. Detailed operating data used for the economic revaluation of
each project berth are shown in Table S2.3, and are highlighted as follows:

D. Economic Costs and Benefits
Economic Costs
9.     All costs associated with the facilities planned under the project were considered in the
economic reevaluation. All inputs and outputs were evaluated in constant December 1995
economic prices (Table S2.4). Financial costs were converted to economic costs by shadow
pricing each berth's input categories. Conversion factors for each input category were based on
estimates determined in completed Bank studies.
10.    The overall conversion factor is 0.93, of which both general cargo and container berths
are 0.91; coal 0.99 and grain 0.96. The factors derived for the various cost items were applied to
annual project expenditures to obtain the stream of project economic costs (Table S2.5).
11.   In the ICR, the effect of shadow pricing project costs was that economic costs were 27.2
percent higher than the financial costs, and total economic costs were 16.9 percent higher than
the SAR estimate at constant December 1995 prices. The comparisons are summarized as
follows:

Economic Benefits
12.   The economic analysis focused on the benefits derived from relieving port congestion.
Details of the traffic forecast are shown in Table S2. 1. The project will yield quantifiable
benefits in the form of savings in cargo handling costs, ship time (both waiting time and
operating time), and cargo time (Table S2.6).
13.   Savings in Cargo Handling Costs. Savings are relatively small and are expected to
accrue from the direct costs of cargo handling in the new facilities as compared with the present
ones. Without the project, the only way to handle traffic in excess of berth capacity would be
through "lightening," but it is estimated that these costs would be three to four times greater than
normal handling costs. Detailed estimates of handling cost savings are shown in Table S2.7.
Lightening was assumed for cargo tonnage in excess of berth capacity at 95 percent occupancy,
at a cost three times that of normal handling. Substantial savings in handling costs are expected
after existing berths are renovated and new berths are built. Savings in handling costs were
converted to economic benefits by shadow pricing the main cost components of normal handling
and lightening. Conversion factors of 1.05 for berth handling and 1.1 for lightening are used;
these factors were estimated in a previous Bank study.
14.   Savings in Ship Time. These include reductions in ship time waiting for berths and
working at berths due to improved cargo handling. Estimates of savings in ship waiting time due
to the project are shown in Table S2.8. Ship costs used for the economic evaluation were at the
low end of the model developed by the Bank. The annualized ship resale value, plus operating
costs, were used to calculate project benefits. The annual resale value of ships was assumed to
reflect the present state of the shipping industry and gives a slightly lower return than the
annualized replacement value.
15.   Savings in Cargo Time. Savings in ship cargo time also apply to the interest saved on
the value of the cargo. For domestic cargo, the marginal source of working capital would be
loans from the National Development Bank of China at an average of 12 percent interest. For
foreign cargo, the higher foreign exchange working capital needed would require more foreign
borrowing, and it is assumed this would be at China's marginal cost of capital (approximately 12
percent). Thus, interest savings were calculated assuming an average annual rate of 12.0 percent.
16.   Total project benefits for the items discussed above are presented by year in Table S2.8.
The major project benefit would be savings in ship time. These would accrue first to ship owners
and could be passed on to cargo owners. Only coal ships are completely owned by the Chinese.
As for other cargoes, except for container handling (which are 50 percent foreign-owned), the
vast majority of ships calling at the port are either Chinese-owned (COSCO) or
Chinese-operated; it is expected that 90 percent of the project benefits would also accrue to
China directly.
