IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
NINGBO AND SHANGHAI PORT PROJECT: NINGBO PORT
(LOAN 30060-CHA)
PREFACE
The Ningbo component of the Ningbo and Shanghai Ports Project in China, Loan 30060-
CHA for $30 million, was approved on December 13, 1988 and made effective on May 9, 1989.
The loan, extended once for two years, was closed cn December 31, 1995. Final disbursements
were made on March 16, 1995. The loan was fully disbursed.
This ICR was prepared by Messrs. Toshiro Tsutsumi (Task Manager) and Han-Kang Yen
(Economic and Financial Analyst) of the Infrastructure Division, China and Mongolia
Department of the East Asia and Pacific Region and reviewed by Messrs. Richard Scurfield
(Chief, EA2IN) and Juergen Voegele (Acting Project Adviser, EA2DR). The Borrower provided
comments that are included as Appendix 2. A separate ICR has been prepared for the Shanghai
Port.
T he ICR was begun just before the loan closing and was based on material in the project
file. The Borrower contributed to the ICR by evaluating the project's execution and initial
preparation.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
NINGBO AND SHANGHAI PORT PROJECT: NINGBO PORT
(LOAN 30060-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.    When the project was identified in the mid-1980s, most Chinese ports were badly
congested and container berths, bulk cargo berths, port equipment, storage yards and transport
infrastructure (for distribution) were in short supply. In fact, it appeared that congestion would
threaten the expansion of China's foreign trade. The Government began to reform the port sector
in 1984, which included self-financing port operations, funding investments by internal cash
generation and promoting competition among ports. Ningbo Port spans three districts, Ningbo,
Zhenhai, and Beilun; the port is located on Hangzhou Bay and connects with the Shanghai region
by coastal shipping. The Ningbo district, which is the oldest, is shallow and situated on the
Yungjiang River. The Zhenhai district is located 21.5 km downstream of Ningbo city near the
mouth of the Yungjiang. The Beilun district, the site of the project, is 37 km from Ningbo city;
the port is deep and located on Hangzhou Bay.
2.    The main objectives of the project were to make Ningbo port's handling of containers and
general cargo more efficient by constructing special berths with modern equipment. The project
also promoted efficiency by rehabilitating existing facilities and training both operational and
managerial staff. Finally, it optimized future development by studying the potential of the port to
distribute cargo more economically.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    The project was completed satisfactorily by December 31, 1995. The closing date was
extended for two years due to a delay in the Shanghai Port component which is under the same
loan. The Ningbo Port component was completed on time.
4.    Project implementation was highly satisfactory because all objectives were achieved:
Physical components were constructed ahead of schedule, equipment was procured, and the
action plan, training and a study were carried out. Training provided extensive courses for both
managers and workers and the Ningbo Port Authority (NPA) operational and maintenance
capacity was improved [paras. 10(d) and 11]. The Master Plan and Port Optimization Study
provided a solid basis for future development [para. 10(a)]; implementation of an action plan
improved the port environment; port operations became more efficient [para. 10(c)], and physical
capacity was substantially increased with the addition of container/multipurpose berths. These
achievements were partly due to the project's relative lack of complexity and to coordination



- iv -
between the Ningbo Port Authority (NPA) and the Ministry of Communications (MOC), which
has overall responsibility for the port sector.
5.    The project's benefits included savings in: (a) cargo-handling costs, (b) ship waiting and
berthing time, and (c) cargo time. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was estimated at
29.1 percent against 26.7 percent in the SAR, which is considered satisfactory (para. 31).
6.    Cost estimates at appraisal were reasonable. The final cost was estimated at about $63.3
million (or Y 136.8 million plus $30.0 million) against $75.7 million (or Y 182.2 million plus
$30.0 million) at appraisal (para. 15). The difference when expressed in US dollars is due to the
devaluation of the local currency.
7.    NPA's financial performance is solid. Although the operational ratio (operating costs/
operating revenues) was higher than estimated in the SAR (61.8 percent against 56.5 percent)
due to sharp domestic price increases in 1992-94, NPA absorbed this by increasing the amount of
container traffic it handled. Since container traffic will most likely expand further, NPA's
financial condition will remain solid.
8.    No environmental or resettlement problems arose during implementation.
Sustainability
9.    At completion, the project appeared sustainable. Because port traffic will undoubtedly
grow along with rapid economic development in the Ningbo area, the expanded facilities are
clearly needed. In fact, traffic in containerized cargo has soared, and the project's container
terminals operate efficiently due to the modern facilities and equipment and trained staff
provided under the project. In addition, NPA is financially stable and has enough resources to
maintain and operate the port properly, if it maintains its current operating scale.
Findings and Lessons Learned
10.   The findings and lessons include the following:
(a)   NPA capably carried out the construction, procured equipment, conducted studies
and developed its organization; NPA completed construction of berths four
months ahead of the schedule with satisfactory quality;
(b)   With regard to the procurement of equipment, there is a risk that problems will
surface when the lowest bidders with marginal experience are awarded contracts
(para. 9);
(c)    Projects should be designed as independently as possible. Although they are
separate and independent projects (the project entities and activities are both
different), the Ningbo and Shanghai Port Projects were combined to facilitate
project preparation. The Ningbo port project, implementation of which was on



time, could not be closed due to the delay in the Shanghai Port Project, and had to
wait for two years (para. 12);
(d)   Performance indicators with regard to port operations, maintenance and
environmental quality were clearly stated in the SAR (to monitor the project's
progress) and proved quite useful;
(e)    Project design was relativeiy straightforward and thus avoided problems of
coordination among various agencies; and
(f)    When tariffs are regulated and price increases are high, actual tariffs cannot reflect
actual costs. It is suggested that some mechanism should be added into the tariff
calculation to reflect actual operational costs.

NINGBO AND SHANGHAI PORT PROJECT: NINGBO PORT
(LOAN 30060-CHA)
PART I. IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    When the project was identified in the mid-1980s, most Chinese ports were badly
congested and container berths, bulk cargo berths, port equipment, storage yards and transport
infrastructure (for distribution) were in short supply. In fact, it appeared that congestion would
threaten the expansion of China's foreign trade. To remedy the situation, the Government began
to reform the ports in Tianjin Port in 1984, and gradually applied to other ports, through
decentralization of responsibilities, which included self-financing of port operations, generating
investment funds through internal cash generation, and promoting competition among ports for
cargo.
2.    Three districts, Ningbo, Zhenhai, and Beilun, make up Ningbo Port, which is located on
the Hangzhou Bay and connects with the Shanghai region by coastal shipping. Ningbo district,
on the Yungjiang River, is the oldest and shallow. The Zhenhai district is located 21.5 km
downstream of Ningbo city near the mouth of the Yungjiang. Beilun district, the site of the
project, is 37 km from Ningbo city, deep and located on Hangzhou Bay.
3.    The main objectives of the project were to make Ningbo port's handling of containers and
general cargo more efficient by constructing special berths with modern equipment. The project
also promoted efficiency by rehabilitating existing facilities and training both operational and
managerial staff. Finally, it optimized future development by studying the potential of the port to
distribute cargo more economically.
4.    Development under the project consisted of:
(a)   Constructing a jetty about 694.0 m long and 47.0 m wide for one container berth
and two general purpose berths with a depth of 14.4 m, and two 14.0 m wide
causeways that connect the jetties to the yard. The berths involved (i) paving
yards and roadways and constructing railway connections, sheds, buildings, water
supply and sewage systems; (ii) procuring container cranes, mobile cranes,
forklifts, vessels, tugboats, vehicles and computers with which to operate the
facilities;
(b)   Rehabilitating existing facilities;
(c)   Training of operational and managerial staff;



- 2 -
(d)   Updating Ningbo Port's master plan, which involved reviewing the effects of the
port expansion on nearby commercial activities, residential areas and transport
infrastructure;
(e)   Preparing a port optimization study on how to best exploit the deep water
potential at Ningbo port through transshipment of cargo, using large vessels;
(f)   Improving the environmental monitoring system in the port area; and
(g)   Implementing an action plan to improve port operations and maintenance.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Project Implementation
5.    This was the fifth Bank-assisted port project in China, following the Three Ports Project,
Tianjin Port Project, Huangpu Port Project, and Dalian Port Project (Table 2). It was the first
Bank-supported project for Ningbo port. The Ningbo Port Authority (NPA) has overall
responsibility for project implementation.
6.    Civil Works. The sole contract, which was for the construction of the container wharf
and multipurpose berths, was awarded to No. 3 Navigation Engineering Bureau, MOC, through
International Competitive Bidding (Package 1, see Table SC). Construction was completed on
time.
7.    Beilun Harbor Construction Command, NPA, supervised the construction with the advice
of foreign consultants. This arrangement was quite successful, as it familiarized the Borrower
with international practices.
8.    Procurement of Equipment. Procurement was in three tranches under international
competitive bidding (ICB). One was for major equipment needed for the container and general
cargo handling (Package 2); another was for a fuel tanker and vehicles (Package 3); the last was
for a rubber-tire gantry crane. Unlike the experience of other port projects in China, the
evaluation period was not too lengthy (only about six months), largely due to NPA's effort to
expedite project implementation. It was accomplished in two stages (which is common in Bank-
financed port projects). The first was at the regional level by the NPA and the second at the
central level, by the State Evaluation Committee.
9.    The contract for two quay-side container cranes was awarded to a foreign bidder (at a
very low price) that had only marginal experience. When the equipment was installed and tested,
it experienced many problems and considerable time was needed to correct them. The cranes
still encounter small problems and require frequent maintenance. Thus, this is another example
that shows that the risk increases when contracts are awarded to bidders with limited experience.

10.   Technical Assistance (TA) and Training. This involved: (a) updating the master plan
study, (b) preparing a port optimization study, (c) improving the environmental monitoring
system, (d) devising an action plan for operations and environmental protection, and (e) training.
(a)   Updating the master plan study and preparing a port optimization study were
combined and implemented by a foreign consulting firm.  The study was
successfully completed in December 1991. Some of its recommendations, such as
to expand the iron ore berth (using local funds) and construct the highway
between Ningbo-Hangzhou-Shanghai (using Bank and local funds) and the double
track railway between Ningbo-Shanghai (using local funds), have been adopted
and are being supported with local and Bank funds.
(b)   The environmental monitoring system was developed under the project and
further strengthened by the Bank under the Global Environmental Facilities
Project and Ship Waste Disposal Project (Cr. 2391/TF. 28613-CHA). Water and
air quality are being monitored periodically.
(c)   The action plan for operations and maintenance included seven elements to
improve operations and four to improve maintenance. The target for the berth
throughput and average berth time (for vessels) has mostly been achieved (see
Table 6).
(i)    With regard to operations, the warehouse at Zhenhai terminal was
improved by constructing a new pavement. Throughput at Beilun was
substantially increased because most operations for general cargo were
shifted from the Ningbo and Zhenhai terminals to Beilun (which has
deeper seawater).  Finally, the average number of berth days was
significantly reduced (see Table 6).
(ii)   Periodic inspections and maintenance have become routine, and workshop
equipment was improved.
(d)   NPA conducted extensive training (both in China and abroad). The extent of
training was reduced from what was planned in the SAR (for overseas training, 82
person-months against 108 person-months and for domestic training, 774 staff
against 1,005 staff) due to the reduced size of the new staff (1,201 against 3,821 in
the SAR) (Table 5B). This reduction was due to the change in the type of cargo
handled. Originally, general cargo (particularly timber), which is labor intensive
to handle, was expected to increase; but, dry bulk, iron ore and coal, which could
be efficiently handled by advanced equipment, increased instead. Given this shift,
the numbers originally thought appropriate for training were considered excessive.
Domestic training, which was for staff at the new stevedoring company, Beilun
Container Company (BCC) (which operates the new berths), was carried out at
the Training Institute; on-the-job training was given at the stevedoring companies
and other ports (Dalian, Tianjin, Shenzhen) and at another institute (the Ningbo

11.   All the new staff at BCC (491 out of 871) received training. In addition, the Ministry of
Communications (MOC) organized domestic training for port staff with foreign experts. In
1992, about 60 staff from NPA attended a Container Management Seminar for three weeks.
Another 51 managers, two operators and one worker attended courses at the Singapore Port
Training Institute, Rotterdam Port Training Institute and Belgium Port Training Center.
Computer training was particularly helpful since the new container/general cargo operations
required advanced computerized technology. If Ningbo and Shanghai ports were separate and
independent projects, supervision and the preparation of the ICR would have been easier. The
preparation of the ICR for Ningbo port had to wait for two years.
12.   The project closing date was extended for two years due to the delay in the Shanghai Port
component. The Ningbo Port component was completed on time.
Project Results
13.   All the project objectives were achieved during implementation:
(a)   NPA's operational and maintenance capabilities were improved, as the targets in
the action plan were achieved;
(b)   The port became more efficient (see Table 6) and its capacity was substantially
increased by the addition of container/general cargo berths;
(c)   The port's environmental quality was improved; and
(d)   The training was quite helpful, particularly as it related to containers. This
activity was new for Ningbo Port, and container cargo handled reached 140,000
teu in 1995. Considering that there are only two quay-side container cranes and
six rubber tired gantry cranes at the yard, this volume is high, as is BCC's
productivity.
14.   Major project benefits were achieved, including savings in: (a) cargo-handling costs,
(b) ship waiting and berthing time, and (c) cargo handling time. The Economic Internal Rate of
Return (EIRR) is reestimated at 29.1 percent against the estimated 26.7 percent in the SAR,
which is considered satisfactory.
15.   Cost estimates at appraisal were reasonable. Final project costs were estimated at about
$63.4 million (or Y 136.8 million plus $30.0 million) against $75.7 million (or Y 182.3 million
plus $30.0 million) estimated at appraisal (Table 8a). The difference when expressed in US
dollars is due to the devaluation of the local currency (Y 1.0=$1/3.7 at appraisal against
Y 1.0=$1/8.50 at completion or Y 1.0=$1/4.101 overall average).
16.   No environmental or resettlement problems arose during implementation.

Financial Performance
17.   Major Financial Reform. After project preparation and during implementation, some
major changes occurred that affected NPA's financial condition and the reporting procedures.
These changes were:
(a)   Decentralization.  Since 1987, some of the port's management and financial
functions were decentralized from the State (MOC) to the municipality. Port
authorities at this level assumed a large part of responsibility for handling daily
management, operations, budget, construction and development functions. And,
although MOC still approves major projects and plans that affect the port's long-
term development, the port now bears the financial obligations for any loans it
obtains. Concurrently, the Government reduced the tax the port pays by requiring
an annual flat-rate payment. This improved the port's capacity to generate cash and
this arrangement has not changed substantially to date. The main financial terms
are: (i) projects costing over Y 30 million need State approval; (ii) annual income
tax payments to the State were replaced by an annual lump sum payment of Y 5.27
million; and (iii) other taxes paid totaled from Y 1.0 million to Y 4.0 million during
1988-93. Beginning in 1994, the total annual tax payments were recalculated to one
single payment of Y 6.0 million.
(b)   New financial reporting procedures. Under instructions from the Ministry of
Finance (MOF), NPA improved its financial accounting procedures in July 1993 to
be consistent with international accounting standards. The new accounting and
reporting system will accelerate the port's commercialization and privatization.
(c)    The revaluation of fixed assets (RFA) of NPA occurred in 1995. The overall
value of fixed assets increased by about 29.5 percent.
18.   Past Financial Performance: Although NPA's operating ratio from 1987 to 1994 was
higher and net profit was lower than the SAR estimates, the port's overall financial performance
was still satisfactory. The total volume of traffic handled in 1994 was 47.1 million tons which is
37.9 percent higher than the SAR forecast (of 34.1 million tons). However, net profit in 1994 was
only Y 55.0 million (against Y 99.0 million forecast). The main reasons were: (a) the rapid
increase in operation-related (sales) taxes and average operating costs, 29.8 percent and 31.6
percent a year, respectively (against 18.2 percent and 16.2 percent projected in the SAR); and (b)
the rapid increase in nonoperating and other overhead expenses.
19.   The SAR's financial forecasts were developed when there were rigid State tariff and price
controls for almost every major commodity. As a result, cost increases and inflation were low and
predictable. In addition, the State had subsidized the cost of many commodities during the previous
three decades (including cargo) and charged users only the planned prices. When the SAR was
prepared, there was no indication that either the cost of resources or the rate of inflation would
change. Therefore, financial forecasts assumed that port charges would remain virtually constant,
and the rate of inflation would be low (from 6.5 percent to 8.0 percent during 1987-94). Although



- 6 -
reasonable at the time, these assumptions now appear very conservative due to a much higher-than-
expected inflation.
20.    In recent years, price controls were removed from  almost all commodities.  During
1987-94, despite the strict control of the State on tariff increases, unit tariffs rose by an average of
14.0 percent per year. This increase, however was offset by: (a) a 12.4 percent increase in unit
operating costs (3.9 percent projected in the SAR); and (b) a 10.1 percent increase in unit
nonoperating expenses (6.8 percent projected in the SAR). Other (overhead and financial) expenses
grew particularly rapidly, having increased by 50 times during 1988-94.
21.    The higher operating costs were mainly due to increases in: (a) the cost of fuel, materials,
wages-most of which have to be paid on the basis of market prices; and (b) depreciation, resulting
from revaluation of fixed assets. The higher nonoperating and other expenses were mainly the
result of: (a) NPA having to bear the costs of many social services; and (b) changes to the financial
reporting procedure in 1993, which split the headquarters' expenses from operating costs to other
expenses. Highlights of the NPA's income statements for selected years, as compared with the
SAR forecast, are summarized below with details shown in Table- N1.1, Annex 1.

22.    The operating ratios were slightly higher than the targets (for 1994, 61.8 percent against
56.5 percent in the SAR). These were due to rapid increases in cost and other expenditures.
23.    In 1994, the rate of return on average net fixed assets (RRFA) was 5 percent, which showed
no change from 1987 (before the project). After years of investments, the unchanged RRFA
indicates the use of capital can be improved  and  operations made more efficient.   The
improvements can be reached by increasing operational efficiency and rationalizing nonoperating
and other expenses.



- 7 -
24.    Present Financial Performance.  Despite the increases in operating costs, the port's
financial position was generally acceptable at the end of 1995. The debt service ratio in 1994 was
2.6. This was lower than the 7.2 forecast in the SAR but was still satisfactory. In 1994, the port's
debt and capital ratio increased to 40 percent (against the 17.3 percent forecast in the SAR), rising
from 0.5 percent in 1987 due to borrowing for new development. The high borrowing also affected
the current ratio: In 1994, it was 1.2, which was much lower than the SAR forecast of 9.1 (if the
current ratio is less than 1.0, the port has short-term solvency problems and needs to strengthen its
finances), but it is still considered to be acceptable.
25.    The salient points in the port's balance sheet are found in Table Nl.2, Annex I and
summarized below:

26.    Future Financial Performance. It is expected that inflation will be stabilized, and thus,
NPA's operating cost will also stabilize. Since port traffic will undoubtedly continue to grow,
NPA's financial performance will remain healthy. In addition, NPA may enjoy the reduced
payments to the State initiated since decentralization of the port in 1987 and still being continued.
27.    However, NPA needs to strengthen its future financial condition to prepare for its future
development. The port's new responsibility for self-financing all its capital investments has not yet
had a major impact on its flow of funds (Tble Nl.3, Annex.1), but is expected to do so in the
future because construction of the next phase (estimated at Y 3.0 billion during 1997-2002 for four
container berths) will require additional funding. MOF provided, in return for self-financing, the
preferencial financial agreement with NPA which expired in 1995. NPA should negotiate with
MOF for streamlining tax payments. Furthermore, NPA should focus on the following:
(a)    Tariffs. At present, the Central Governnent devises the standard tariff schedule
applied to all ports. However, it is recommended that port authorities be allowed



- 8 -
some flexibility to set their own tariffs at a level that would enable them to cover all
operating costs, strengthen their finances and compete with other ports by providing
better services;
(b)    Revaluation of fixed assets (RFA). An RFA should be legally required on a
regular basis;
(c)    Services reforms. Some welfare and social activities not directly related to the
port's daily operations, such as the running of schools and hospitals, should be
transferred to local agencies along with their operating costs.
Economic Reevaluation
28.   The economic analysis presented in this report is based on the revaluation of data on traffic,
operational performance, economic costs and the benefits of project components.   The
methodology used in the ICR is similar to that in the SAR and is summarized as follows:
(a)    Capital investment and maintenance costs were revised to reflect December 1995
prices and are included in the cost stream;
(b)    The benefit stream, also reflected in December 1995 prices, was included, and
consists of savings in port handling, ship port time (berth and waiting), and cargo
port time (berth and waiting);
(c)    A project life of 20 years was assumed; the capital investment period for all berths
was from 1989 to 1994; and
(d)   Benefits started to accrue fully in 1992.
29.   The decrease in general cargo traffic (by 41.7 percent in tonnage) was totally offset by the
better-than-expecttd container traffic (an increase of 107 percent in tonnage) (Annex 2).
30.   Based on the revised data, the reevaluation of the economic internal rate of return (REIRR)
for this project was reestimated at 29.1 percent, which is slightly higher than the SAR estimate of
26.7 percent. A detailed analysis is presented in Annex 2.
31.   The REIRR and the SAR estimates in terms of economic rate of return and net present
value (NPV) are given below.

C. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
32.   Positive influences included:
(a)   A rapidly developing regional and national economy that increased port traffic
(particularly container traffic);
(b)   The Borrower's experience in implementing similar type of projects; and
(c)   A close working relationship between the Borrower and Bank.
The only negative factor was the higher-than-expected price hikes that significantly increased
NPA's operating costs.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
33.   At completion, the project appeared sustainable. Because port traffic will undoubtedly
grow, along with rapid economic development in the Ningbo area, the port's expanded facilities
will be needed. In fact, traffic in containerized cargo has soared and the project's container
terminals are efficient, due to the advanced facilities, equipment and trained staff provided. In
addition, NPA is financially stable and has enough resources to maintain and operate the port
efficiently.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
34.   The Bank identified the issues and prepared the project in a timely fashion. It was
identified in April 1987 and appraised in March 1988. Bank supervision was also efficient: The
annual average input of staff resources was 17.5 staff-weeks combined with the Shanghai Port
Project, which included various specialties (see Table 12). This was possible because the
supervision of six Bank-financed port projects was well coordinated.
35.   With regard to procurement, the Bank took a consistent position and provided guidance,
when necessary.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
36.   In general, the Borrower's performance was good and preparation and implementation
were excellent. The operations and maintenance action plan targets were substantially met
during implementation, and as shown in Table 10, Part II, covenants were generally met, as well.
The Borrower's performance, therefore, was evaluated as highly satisfactory.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
37.   This project is assessed as "highly satisfactory" because it achieved all major objectives
without any major shortcomings.



- 10-
38.   Net present value was positive, Y 919.5 million against Y 579.7 million in the SAR (see
para. 31), when flows were discounted at 12 percent for a major part of the investment.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
39.   The project provided facilities that should be able to handle traffic until the late 1990s.
However, due to the rapid increase in traffic, NPA extended the project jetty (using funds from a
local bank), thereby providing another three general cargo berths. To operate optimally, NPA
will need to obtain additional equipment for container handling; it estimates that this will cost
$30 million for three quay-side container cranes, nine rubber-tire gantry cranes, and other
equipment.
40.   The decentralization of port management from the central government to the municipal
level has been successful: NPA, an autonomous entity under the municipal government, has
shown it can implement projects and manage the port capably. However, it has enjoyed a
monopoly position since it was established (as have other port authorities in China) and has
therefore not lowered operating costs significantly. Thus, to improve its operational efficiency
even more, NPA could introduce the concept of competition among its subsidiary companies that
operate terminals; or, it could promote joint ventures with experienced foreign operators.
41.   Adjacent to the port, a national project, Daxie Island Development, is being planned that
includes extensive industrial and port development. A joint venture of the China International
Trust & Investment Corporation (under the State Council) and a foreign consulting firm is
preparing the project and foreign investors as well as NPA are being invited to invest. NPA has
revised its master plan, including Daxie Development, and MOC has coordinated and authorized
the project under the long-term port development plan. NPA may become a partner of the Daxie
Island Development or compete with the Daxie port district. If Daxie port is developed, NPA's
monopoly situation will disappear.
42.   To increase the port's efficiency, authorities will need to monitor it carefully, along with
its financial performance. To accomplish this, they will need to evaluate: (a) tariff level and
operational cost; (b) staffing level for management and operation; (c) traffic level; and
(d) productivity indicators, including: (i) ship waiting time, and (ii) cargo handling volume per
day per vessel and moves (load/unload) of container boxes per hour per crane.
I. FINDINGS AND LESSONS LEARNED
43.   The findings and key lessons from project implementation include:
(a)   NPA capably carried out the construction, procured equipment, conducted studies
and developed its organization; NPA completed construction of berths four
months ahead of the schedule with satisfactory quality;
(b)   With regard to the procurement of equipment, there is a risk that problems will
surface when a contract is awarded to a company with only marginal experience
(para. 9);



- I1 -
(c)   Project components should be designed as independently as possible. Although
project activities at Ningbo and Shanghai ports were separate and independent
(the port entities were different and the two activities had no interaction), they
were combined to facilitate project preparation. The Ningbo port component,
implementation of which was on time, could not be closed on time due to the
delay in the Shanghai Port Project (para. 12);
(d)   Performance indicators with regard to port operations, maintenance and
environmental quality were clearly stated in the SAR (to monitor the project's
progress) and proved quite useful;
(e)   Project design was relatively straightforward and thus avoided problems of
coordination among various agencies; and
(f)    When tariffs are regulated and inflation is high, actual tariffs cannot reflect actual
costs. It is suggested that some mechanism should be added into the tariff
calculation to reflect actual operational costs.
44.   Since this is the sixth completion report for Chinese port projects approved in the 1980s
(after two Project Completion Reports for the Three Ports Project and Dalian Port, and three
ICRs for Tianjin, Huangpu and Xiamen Ports), it is worth summarizing findings and lessons
learned from these projects as shown below:
(a)   Decentralization of the ports has been satisfactory. This was proven by the
operational and financial performance of the port authorities.
(b)   Although still limited, involvement of the private sector in container terminal
operation has been initiated-it is already established in Shanghai and Dalian, and
being prepared in Xiamen and Ningbo.
(c)   Simple project designs and clear implementation targets, with a single executing
agency, were the key for successful implementation of the projects.
(d)   The major reason for implementation delays was procurement, due to long
evaluation periods.  In order to avoid confusion in the evaluation period:
(i) postqualification criteria should clearly be provided in bidding documents;
(ii) an evaluation report should provide clear and sufficient reasons for
nonresponsiveness, if the lowest bidder is not proposed to be awarded; and
(iii) sufficient time should be reserved for the procurement process.
(e)   The SAR's inclusion of action plans for operational improvement was effective
for supervision and implementation of projects. Productivity was improved
through implementation of action plans in Huangpu, Xiamen, Shanghai and
Ningbo ports.



- 12 -
45.   For future port development, the following changes are suggested:
(a)    The port tariff is largely regulated by the Central Government and not based on
the actual operating cost. This should be corrected.
(b)   Competition is the key factor for operational improvement. Since many ports
enjoy a monopoly situation, it is important to introduce the concept of
competition among the terminal operators.
(c)    Some nonport activities such as schools and hospitals should be transferred from
port authorities to local agencies.

LA Due to the increase of vessel size for general cargo, more than 50 percent of general cargo is unloaded at
Beilun area and transshipped to these berths. Since transshipped cargo is not included in the statistics,
cargo volume at these berths appears less than half of the actual volume.
lb This is the exceptional case (Cargo was not in the proper condition and required an extra time).
I& Vessel size and cargo volume are increasing, but the port has no specialized bagging system. NPA should is
considering provision of a specialized system for bulk grain.

APPENDIX B: BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ICR
Section A
1.    The First Stage of the Second Phase Project of Beilun Harbour District in Ningbo Port is
the first project by applying World Bank loan for the marine works and handling machines
through ICB. It is also the first time to select the experts from international consulting company
to manage the marine works of the project, using the international common construction
supervision. The project construction was officially commenced in May 1989 and completed in
September 1991 and officially accepted and put into operation by the State Acceptance
Commission on September 28, 1991. Therefore, it increases the container and general cargo
handling capacity in Ningbo Port.
2.    The project design is reasonable in general layout, handling technology is advanced and
structures are liable. There are 15 major construction items, of which 10 items such as the
marine works of three berths and two trestles were evaluated as excellent. The remaining five
items were evaluated as qualified. The overall evaluation of the project quality is good.
Therefore, the project quality is good.
3.    Since the project was concerned and assisted by the State Planning Commission, the
Ministry of Communications (MOC) and the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Communications
Investment Corporation (CIC), Zhejiang Province and Ningbo Municipality, and was helped by
the World Bank and jointly cooperated by the Employer, the Contractor, Supervisory Engineer
and the Design Institute. After tight and effective works for 28 months, the construction of the
project was completed a half year ahead of the contract was signed by Ningbo Port Authority
(NPA) and CIC. Little saving of the investment has been achieved.
4.    During the consulting works on the marine design, Parsons Brinckerhoff International
Inc., USA proposed that three-dimensional structural calculation shall be adopted for the
calculations of horizontal force of the wharf structures in order to reduce the number of piles.
Serious analysis on the test pile data and re-optimization of the design were made by NPA and
the Third Design Institute of Navigation Engineering of MOC. Four hundred seventy-three
prestressed reinforcement concrete hollow square piles were reduced.
5.    Procurement of over 90 units of handling machines and other equipment were carried out
strictly in accordance with the Guidelines set by the World Bank through ICB. It provides a
solid foundation for the development of Ningbo Port.
6.    Parsons Brinckerhoff International Inc. (USA) was selected to undertake the construction
supervision of the marine works. On one hand, Chinese technical personnel were selected to
participate in the construction supervision group directed by the resident Engineer from Parsons
Brinckerhoff International Inc. and, on the other hand, it was specified that the construction



- 29 -                   Appendix B
supervision group shall be under Zhejiang Beilun Harbour Construction Command (BHCC) and
shall be responsible for the project manager (the agent of BHCC). The practice proved that this
kind of organization is effective for the construction supervision. The Chinese technical
personnel not only can learn international advanced technology and management experience, but
also improve their working capabilities. This ensured the quality of the project. The progress and
investment of the project was controlled effectively.
7.    Particular attention was given to environmental protection, fire fighting and later
protection in order not to produce negative impact on the environment in this area. Meanwhile,
design, construction and completion were undertaken simultaneously.
8.   In accordance with the relevant provisions and procedures of the Guidelines set by the
World Bank and the requirements of ICB, on one hand, some professional technical personnel
were sent abroad for a short period of training and, on the other hand, personnel were sent to the
domestic ports for better understanding. By this way, they could quickly understand the working
procedures and methods of ICB and worked out a management method which was suitable to the
actual conditions of Ningbo Port. This ensured the ICB for marine works and handling machines
to be completed satisfactorily and timely.
9.    The project design was basically undertaken by the Chinese design institute, i.e., the
Third Design Institute of Navigation Engineering of MOC. In general, the design is a success.
The design institute made a great effort to ensure satisfactory execution of the project.
10.   During the project construction, in accordance with the development requirements of the
port, the saving of the World Bank loan (partial was self-financed) was used to procure
additional RTG which was approved by the World Bank. This enabled the container berth to be
fully utilized.
11.  In order for the completed project to have economic benefits, after completion of the
container berth on June 30, 1990, and the acceptance of the marine works of three berths on June
29, 1991, the project was put into operation immediately. Up to September 15, 1991, 118,400
tons were handled and 2,523 TEU were handled. After operation of three berths, the throughput
increased yearly. The throughput of three berths was 4.08 million tons and container throughput
was 157,600 TEU in 1995. The completion of the project is filled with new vigor to the
development of Ningbo Port. This is a real success project.
Section B
12.   Part I of the ICR drafted by the World Bank is comprehensive. Its analysis is correct and
complies with the actual conditions.
13.   With respect to the data of each item on the list of Part III of ICR, we acknowledge that
they are correct and fully show the overall situation.



-30 -                   Appendix B
Section C
14.   With respect to the quay side container crane, in principle, we agree with the comments
of the World Bank. Attention shall be given to the manufacturing experience, manufacturing
capacity of the manufacturer in the evaluation of bids.
15.   From the project appraisal to the implementation, the World Bank was very positive and
effective. NPA appreciates all officials and experts from the World Bank who participated in
this project for their efforts and contributions made to the port development.
16.   During the whole implementation period, we have kept close cooperation and mutual
respect which the relevant divisions of the World Bank and the experts sent by the World Bank.
This strengthens a mutual understanding and trust so that the problems which arose from the
project construction can be resolved and the difficulties from the project implementation can be
overcome. Therefore, the project can be completed successfully.

ANNEX 2: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. The Port and Traffic
1.      Ningbo port has the deepest natural water berths on the east coast of China.  The port
does not freeze and can be operated year around. The harbor does not need expensive breakwater
construction, and dredging required for the channel is minimum. In 1994, NPA handled 47.05
million tons of traffic or 38.8 percent higher than the SAR forecasted of 33.9 million ton. It is a
transshipment center for dry bulk cargoes (iron ores and coal) which constituted about 85 percent
of total 1994 port traffic. The transport pattern of these dry bulk cargoes is big vessels in (from
ocean) and the smaller vessels out (to coastal ports and rivers).
2.       The total traffic for the project berths (general cargo and container) constituted only
about 8.5 percent of NPA's total 1994 traffic or 3.99 million tons. This traffic volume was about
28.6 percent less than the SAR forecast of 5.58 million ton. NPA traffic, as well as that related
to the project berths, shown in Table N2.1 is summarized as follows.

(2) Container traffic.
(3) Subtotal for the project traffic.
(4) (4)= (3)/total.
3.      Despite the severe economic recession in the early 1990s, the total traffic of the port grew
at an average 17.1 percent per year during 1987-1994 compared with 11.7 percent estimated in
the SAR. In addition, traffic, during 1990-1994 grew by 23.3 percent per year (6.0 percent per



- 37 -                    ANNEX2
year forecasted in the SAR). Based on the area's economic activities (a special economic zone is
adjacent to the port) and the long-term transport development plans (two Bank-financed
expressways are under construction, one linking the port to Shanghai via Hangzhou, and a
railway project under construction would double capacity between Ningbo and Hangzhou), the
growth of port traffic for the next two and half decades (1995-2020) is estimated to be
approximately 4.0 percent per year.
4.    General cargo traffic: Traffic in 1994 was much lower than estimated, by about 41.7
percent. However, for the last four years (1990-1994), it grew by 17.0 percent a year (5.0 percent
estimated in the SAR). The port needs additional general cargo berths to meet the demand.
Currently, through domestic financing, NPA has completed the construction of one additional
general cargo berth and two coal berths adjacent to the berths financed by the Bank.
5.    Container traffic: The traffic in 1994 was 107.2 percent higher than the SAR estimate.
It is estimated that container traffic in 1995 would grew by about 12.8 percent over 1994. The
growth of the container penetration ratio, however, is concentrated on foreign trade, particularly
foreign going traffic, which increased from 16 percent in 1987 to 84 percent in 1994. Despite the
substantial increased in foreign-bound container traffic, the share of domestic-bound, in 1994,
was still negligible.
B. Ship Time Analysis
6.    General Cargo Carriers (for break bulk cargoes): Comparing 1990 (without the
project) to 1994 (with the project), general cargo carriers spent an average of 2.7 days and 2.9
days, respectively, in the port, of which the ship waiting time in the port (nonproductive time)
decreased from 1.08 days to 1.05 days. During the same period, the average working time per
ship (unit productive time at berth) has increased from 1.19 days to 1.32 days. While the average
shipment per vessel increased from 3,000 ton/ship to 10-20,000 ton/ship. The total number of
general cargo vessels calling at the port in 1994 has doubled since 1990. Thus, without the
project, the added traffic demand would have lengthened the ship waiting time (Table N2.2).
7.    Container Carriers: Despite an increase in the average shipment size from 250 teu to
300 teu, the average total ship days spent in the port per ship, between 1990 and 1994, has
decreased from 1.86 days to 0.81 days. And, the average (productive) time needed to unload per
ship has decreased from 0.60 days to 0.33 days. The new equipment not only improved the
efficiency but also maximized the availability of the equipment. The nonproductive time, for
example, decreased from 0.97 da, to 0.44 day, while total number of container vessels calling at
the port increased 5.8 times. (Table N2.2).
C. Berth Operations
8.    Operating data for general cargo and container berths at the port also differ somewhat
from the SAR estimates. Detailed operating data used for the economic re-evaluation of each
project berth are shown in Table N2.3, and is highlighted as follows:

D. Economic Costs and Benefits
Economic Costs
9.     All costs needed to complete the facilities planned under the project were considered in
the economic reevaluation. All inputs and outputs were evaluated in constant December 1995
economic prices (Table N2.4). Financial costs were converted to economic costs by shadow
pricing each berth's input categories. Conversion factors for each input category were based on
estimates determined in completed Bank studies.
10.    The overall conversion factor is 1.0, of which both general cargo and container berths are
1.0. The factors derived for the various cost items were applied to annual project expenditures to
obtain the stream of project economic costs (Table N2.5).



- 39 -                    ANNEX2
11.  In the ICR, the effect of shadow pricing project costs was that economic costs were 41.4
percent higher than the financial costs, and total economic costs of the project are 5.3 percent
higher than the SAR estimate at constant December 1995 prices.  The comparisons are
summarized as follows:

Economic Benefits
12.   The economic analysis focused on the benefits derived from relieving port congestion.
Details of the traffic forecast are shown in Table N2.1. The project will yield quantifiable
benefits in the form of savings in cargo handling costs, ship time (both waiting time and
operating time), and cargo time (Table N2.6).
13.   Savings in Cargo Handling Cost. Savings are relatively small, and are expected to
accrue from the direct cost of cargo handling in the new facilities as compared with the present
ones. Without the project, the only way to handle traffic in excess of berth capacity would be
through "lightening", but it is estimated these costs would be three to four times greater than
normal handling costs. Detailed estimates of handling cost savings are shown in Table N2.7.
Lightening was assumed for cargo tonnage in excess of berth capacity at 95 percent occupancy,
at a cost three times that of normal handling. Substantial savings in handling costs are expected
after existing berths are renovated and new berths (proposed) are built. Savings in handling costs
were converted to economic benefits by shadow pricing the main cost components of normal
handling and lightening. Conversion factors of 1.05 for berth handling and 1.1 for lightening are
used; these factors were estimated in a previous Bank study.
14.   Savings in Ship Time. These include reductions in ship time waiting for berths and
working at berths due to improved cargo handling. Estimates of savings in ship waiting time due
to the project are shown in Table N2.8. Ship costs used for the economic evaluation were at the
low end of the ship cost model developed by the Bank. The annualized ship resale value, plus
operating costs, was used to calculate project benefits. The annual resale value of ships was



- 40 -                     ANNEX2
assumed to reflect the present state of the shipping industry and gives a slightly lower return than
the annualized replacement value.
15.   Savings in Cargo Time. Savings in ship cargo time also applies to the interest saved on
the value of the cargo. For domestic cargo, the marginal source of working capital would be
loans from the National Development Bank of China about 10 percent interest. For foreign
cargo, the higher foreign exchange working capital needed would require more foreign
borrowing, and it is assumed that this would be at China's marginal cost of capital
(approximately 12 percent). Roughly 60 percent of all cargo passing through NPA involves
domestic trade. Thus, interest savings were calculated assuming an average annual rate of 10.0
percent.
16.   Total project benefits for the items discussed above are presented by year in Table N2.8.
The major project benefit would be in ship time savings. These would accrue first to ship owners
and could be passed on to cargo owners. Only coal ships are all Chinese owned (by 100
percent).  As for other cargoes, the vast majority of ships calling at the port are either
Chinese-owned (COSCO) or Chinese-operated; it is expected that 90 percent of the project
benefits would also accrue to China directly.
E. Overall Economic Reevaluation and Sensitivity Analysis
17.   Table N2.9 sets out the Reevaluated Economic Rate of Return (RERR), Net Present
Value (NPV) and sensitivity calculations for the entire project. The overall RERR is 25.8
percent. Compared with the SAR, the sensitivity of the project to variations in costs and benefits
are summarized as follows:

(iii) maximum annual capacity per berth - theoretical annual berth capacity x maximum bertb utiliztion.
/ 1: Three additional general cargo berths were completed before 1990.
/2: For lightening operation, throughput capacity is taken as 50% of normal berth throughput capacity.
/3: Figures in the table are costs for normal berth handling. If cargo trafflc exceeds 95% berth
occupancy rate, additional cargo traffic will be handled by lightening at three times the
costs for normal berth handling.
