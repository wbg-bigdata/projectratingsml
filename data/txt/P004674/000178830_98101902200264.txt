INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REFORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT MI
THE GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND
FOR THE CHAO PHYA IRRIGATION IWPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed develop-
ment credit to the Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent of US$5.5 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance the Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project.
PART I - TRE ECONOMY
2.        A report on the economy of Thailand, based on the findings of a
mission which visited the country in September 1972, was distributed to the
Executive Directors on March 9, 1973.   This updated the basic economic report
which was distributed to the Executive Directors under cover of a memorandum
from the Secretary (R72-12 of January 18, 1972).   A sumary of the mission's
findings and conclusions was given in my report on the Third Education Project
which was distributed to Executive Directors under cover of a memorandum from
the Secretary (IDA/R73-13 of March 1, 1973) and is reproduced in Annex I,
following the Country Data.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THAILAND
3.        My report and recommendations on the Third Education Project also set
out past Bank Group lending in Thailand and discussed the Bank Group's strategy
for Thailand and the projects which are expected to come forward for your con-
sideration during the balance of FY73 and FY74.   The relevant section, slightly
amended to bring it up to date, is attached at Annex I, Pages 7 and 8.  A
summary of Bank Group operations in Thailand, including comments on projects in
execution,is attached as Annex II.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
4.        As Thailand's economry has developed and diversified, agriculture's
contribution to gross domestic product has decreased, from 0o% in 1960 to 28%
in 1970.   While the economy  grew at a rate of 8% per year over the decade,
agriculture maintained a rate of expansion a little above 5%, which was sub-
stantially in excess of the annual population increase of 3.1%.   Notwithstanding
agriculture's slowly diminishing role in the economy, the sector still employs
(1971) close to 80% of the total labor force and accounts for 70% of total exports.
5.        Rice is both the country's staple food crop and its largest single
export commodity.   Paddy is grown on about 70% of the cultivated area, roughly
half the value of all crop output, and close to 10% of the gross domestic product.
Rice's share in the value of total exports, however, decreased from 33% in 1965
to 17% in 1971 because of a decline in price.   While Thailand can expect only



-2-
limited growth in rice exports over the next decade, paddy production will have
to be raised by 4 million tons just to satisfy increased domestic requirements.
As the lands on which rice farming could expand are limited, increasingly
marginal and often needed for the expansion of other crops, increases in paddy
production will have to come from higher yields.   Yield improvements will also
be required if Thailand is to maintain its price advantage in the world rice
trade, and if the incomes of rice farmers are to be raised.
6.        Thailand's farmers have proved themselves resourceful in achieving a
considerable diversification of crops over thle past decade in response to
changes in demand.   When the export value of rice dropped 33% between 1965
and 1971, the accelerated movement into other crops, such as maize, cassava,
kenaf and sugar, enabled Thailand nonetheless to achieve a 9% increase in the
total value of agricultural exports.
7.        Continued good performance in the agricultural sector will remain a
prerequisite for Thailand's continued growth over the next decade.    In 1971/72,
a Bank Group agricultural sector mission reviewed with the Government its
central strategy for agricultulral development as contained in the Third Plan,
1972-76.   This strategy aims to foster improvements in rice production and
accelerate diversification into other crops having good prospects for export
or import substitution.   The value of agricultural exports during the next
five years is expected to increase about 32%, providing about half of the
projected increase in total export earnings.   Maize is projected to account
for 32% of the increase in va'Lue of agricultural exports, cassava 19%, and
rubber 16%.   It is doubtful, however, that these increases will be realised
unless yields improve, particularly for maize and cassava, and provision is
made for adequate storage and port facilities.    The Bank Group is working with
the Grovernment in identifying projects in these areas as well as opportunities
for financing other forms of agricultural production, namely livestock, forestry,
nulowood, rubber, etc.
&.        The lack of tested and certified seeds ald the high price of nitro-
genous fertiliser have restricted the increase of agricultural production.    An
IBRD/FAO Cooperative Program mission is currently assisting the Government in
finalising a national seed program and the first phase of this program is
presently being appraised in conjunction with the Phitsanulok Irrigation Project.
As prices for nitrogenous fertilisers are generaLly higher in Thailand than
elsewhere in Asia and in view of the need to make fertiliser readily available
to farmers, the Bank Group sponsored a National Fertiliser Study in Thailand
during 1972. The conclusionS of the study are being discussed with the
Uovernment.
9.        Government supporting services for agriculture have not proved to be
very effective in the past due to a lack of coordination and cooperation
between the many and varied Government agencies which touch on agriculture.
This situation should improve with the Government's recent decision to return
the Royal Irrigation Departmenit and the Land Development Department to the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture.   The Second Education Project,
Loan No 822-TH, which is helping finance the expansion and improvement of



- 3 -
Thailand's principal agricultural university, includes a study to assist with
the development of coordinated programs for the three areas of research,
education and extension.   The Fifth Highway Project, Loan No 870-TH, will
help finance the construction of 387 km of feeder roads in rural areas and
feasibility studies for a further 1200 km.   The present project represents
another step in a series of cooperative efforts by the Government and the Bank
Group to increase agricultural productivity and to improve the farmers' lot.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
10.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement
Project, Thailand" (No 24a-TH dated March 16, 1973) is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors.   A loan and project summary is provided
in Annex III.
The Chao Phya Plain
11.       The Chao Phya Plain (see map attached), in which the project area
is located, is an area of approximately one million hectares; it is inundated
every wet season and farmers use these waters to produce about one fifth of
Thailand's rice crop.   The Plain, however, has traditionally had a twofold
water problem.   Firstly, the river floods were irregular both in timing and in
height, and secondly almost no cropping was possible during the dry season for
lack of water.   To cope with these problems, considerable investments have been
made since 1950, including assistance from four Bank loans.
12.       The first phase in water control in the Plain was the construction of
Chainat diversion dam, and a system of main canals and drains, completed in 1957
and partially financed by a Bank loan of US$18 million (36-TH).    The system was
designed to reduce damage from flooding by facilitating the drainage of excess
waters, and to provide water for supplementary irrigation during dry spells in
the wet season.   The system was further extended with the construction of a
water distribution network which started in 1963 with the assistance of a Bank
loan of US$5.6 million (328-TH) and was completed in 1970.    The system now
covers the entire northern part of the Chao Phya Plain.
13.       The second phase of development, the expansion of dry-season cropping,
was initiated with the construction of the Bhumiphol dam on the Ping River, the
westernmost tributary of the Chao Phya.    The dam and power facilities, financed
with a Bank loan of US$66 million (175-TH), was completed in 1964.    It provides
hydroelectric power and permits the storage of monsoon runoff, sufficient for
dry-season cropping of 220,000 ha in the Plain.   Finally, the completion of
the Sirikit dam on the Nan River, the easternmost tributary of the Chao Phya,
has secured additional water supply for an extension of dry-season cropping on
180,000 ha in the Chao Phya Plain as well as 200,000 ha in the Nan River Valley.
The Sirikit dam, financed with a Bank loan of US$26 million (514-TH), came into
operation during 1972.   Prior to the construction of the Sirikit dam, however,
it was recognised that further investments would be required to make possible
dry-season irrigation and studies for the purpose were included under Loan 514-TH.



14.       Investments prior to Sirikit dam had resulted in better drainage and
flood control which permitted a shift from broadcast to transplanted rize,
especially on higher land in the liorthem Chao Phya Plain, and reduced damage
from flooding.   The areas under rice expanded and rice yields during the wet
season increased.   The expansion of dry-season irrigation, however, remained
slow: by 1972, the dry-season cultivated area totalled about 110,000 ha in the
entire Plain, as against an available water supply sufficient to irrigate
400,000 ha after completion of the Sirikit dam.   The main causes for slow
growth in double cropping, as analyzed in the studies carried out by the Ministry
of Agriculture and Royal Irrigation Department with the help of consultants under
Loan 514-TH, can be summarisecd as follows:  (a) the main irrigation canals were
designed to handle wet-season flows and are unable in most areas to deliver
dry-season gravity irrigation, without the construction of additional check
structures; (b) the distribution network was limited to areas adjacent to the
main canals; and (c) the need to realign farm boundaries in most areas to
enable a rational layout of the distribution network.   These deficiencies result
from an irrigation design aiming at low-cost, wet-season water control in areas
which had previously relied on natural inundation.    The time has now come for
taking this water control a stage further.
Pilot Projects
15.       To test the-conclusions of the studies financed under Loan 514-TH,
aimed at identifying the constraints on the expansion of dry-season cropping,
two pilot projects (at Chanasutr and Sappaya in the Northern Chao Phya Plain)
were carried out on a total of about 2,500 ha between 1969 and 1972 with bilateral
assistance.   They involved the construction of farm irrigation and drainage
ditches, land leveling, and realignment of farm boundaries.   With only limited
assistance from the Extension Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, both
projects succeeded in introducing double cropping over 80% of the area, mainly
with high-yielding rice varieties, within three years from project commencement.
The Project
16.       The success of the two pilot projects encouraged the Government to
plan for the extension of dry-season irrigation in the Plain to an additional
200,000 ha over the next ten years.   The present project would be the first
stage in this development and would provide on a sufficiently large scale the
necessary field experience to guide the future development of double cropping.
17.       The project was prepared by the Government with the assistance of
consultants who have been retained to prepare the final designs of the rehabilita-
tion works, due to be completed by July 1973.    The project was appraised in
June/July 1972 and the proposed credit was negotiated in Washington from February
12 to 15, 1973.   The Government delegation was led by the Under-Secretary of
State for Agriculture, Mr Prida Karnsut, who was accompanied by the Deputy
Under-Secretary, Mr Thalerng Thamron Nawasawat.
18.       The proposed project would improve irrigation facilities and supporting
services to farmers in an area of about 17,000 ha in the Northern Chao Phya Plain;



this would enable an increase in wet-season rice yields as well as the cultivation
of rice and some upland crops during the dry season.   About 6,600 families,
averaging six members per family, or a total farm population of nearly 40,000,
live in the project area.   The average farm size is small - 2.5 ha, with 85%
of the farms (comprising 64% of the area) having less than h ha.   Most holdings
are fragmented into two or three plots and it is not uncommon to find one plot
located in the low-lying broadcast rice area and another in the better drained
transplanted rice area.   The degree of fragmentation, however, is not too
serious and only a realignment of farm boundaries is required to enable a more
rational layout of the distribution network.   Most farmers are able to cultivate
their land with the help of their families and use hired labor (about 15% of
total labor needs) only at peak periods. About 95% of all farms in the project
area are owner-operated, though only a small percentage of the cultivated area
under the project is presently covered by rights of occupancy recognized for
legal transfer or as security for credit.
19.       Specifically, the project would involve:
(a) Rehabilitation of irrigation canals, drains and roads serving
the project area.
(b) On-farm development works involving the surveying, planning and
carrying out of (i) the construction of irrigation and drainage
ditches, farm roads, land leveling, and realignment of farm
boundaries on 10,000 ha; (ii) the repair or construction of farm
irrigation and drainage ditches and minor works related thereto on
7,000 ha; and (iii) the issuance of land titles.
(c) Provision of necessary supporting agricultural services to
farmers, including extension, research, seed multiplication,
credit, and a fisheries' development scheme and the construction
of residence and office buildings.
(d) A feasibility study for a second stage project in the Northern
Chao Phya Plain and a study to propose cost recovery levels and
collection procedures.
The project will be carried out in two non-contiguous areas of equal size; one
sub-project is located in the district of Sanburi, Chainat Province, the second
in the district of Bangrachan, Singburi Province.
Project Execution
20.       Execution of the project would be the responsibility of the Office of
Irrigated Agriculture, newly established in the Ministry of Agriculture under the
Deputy Under-Secretary who would also be the Project Director for the project.
This Office would formulate the annual plan of operations, prepare project
budgets, award contracts, and approve the appointment of key personnel to the
project. The Project Director would report directly to the inter-Ministerial
Central Policy Committee for Irrigated Agriculture, established in 1972 under
the chairmanship of the Under-Secretary of State for Agriculture and comprising



-6-
the heads of all relevant depa:rtmentts in the Ministry of Agriculture plus
representatives of the Ministr. of Biterior, Ministry of Finance ald the Bank
for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC).
21.       A Project Manager, reporting to the Project Director, would be
responsible for the planning and implementation of day-to-day actJvities in the
field.   He would be assisted 'by two Project Supervisors (one for each sub-
project area) and four Section Heads in charge of administration; engineering,
including operation and maint-anance; extension and training; and credit and
farmers' organizations, respectively.   Full-time professional staff, who would
continue to receive technical support from their respective departments, would
be seconded to the project from the Ministry of Agriculture, and back-up
specialists would visit the project area as required.
22.       The rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage system and feeder
roads would be carried out by staff seconded from RID's operation and maintenance
regional offices in each sub-project area.   These offices have a competent
engineering staff to carry out such works.   Cadastral surveys, to be carried
out by the Land Department of the Ministry of Interior, will be required to
prmit both the realignment of boundaries and the issuance of land titles.
Planning, design and supervision of on-farm development works, together with
the realigrment of farm boundaries, would be carried out by the engineering
sections of the project organization.   On-farm development would be carried
out up to 75 percent by RID with the balance undertaken by local contractors.
Responsibility for extension services to project farmers would be with the
project organization which would employ field extension workers in a ratio of
one to 200 farmers.   The field extension workers would be recruited from the
more progressive farmers in the area and would be specially trained by the
project organization for the purpose.   In order to ensure the availability
of necessary research information, it is proposed that a technical camnittee
be established for the project at the Regional Research Center at Chainat, con-
sisting of the Directors and senior personnel of the three research stations
located in the vicinity of the project area, the Project Manager, and project
extension specialists.   The technical committee would also supervise a seed
selection and multiplication program to be initiated through selected farmers.
So far as the provision of credit is concerned, BAAC will increase its trained
staff in branch offices serving the project areas and make available such funds,
both short-term and long-term as shall be needed by farmers.
23.       To assist project staff in the planning, design, and construction as
well as in the provision of supporting agricultural services to the farmers,
the services of a consulting firm would be retained during the four-year con-
struction period.   The consultants would also help the Ministry of Agriculture's
staff prepare a feasibility study for a second stage project, and would assist
project specialists in providing intensive in-service training of staff in order
to prepare a competent nucleus of personnel for implementation of a second stage
and other projects.
Cost Estimates
24.       Taking into account recent currency realignments, the estimated cost
of the project is $10.6 million equivalent, including $1.9 million for



-7-
contingencies; the estimated foreign exchange component is $5.5 million.
Detailed cost estimates are provided in Annex III.
25.       The proposed IDA credit of $5.5 million would cover the estimated
foreign exchange component; the balance of funds required for the project would
be made available by the Government through budgetary allocation.
Procurement
26.       The rehabilitation of the irrigation system, involving the repair
of a large number of small structures spread throughout the project area, and
feeder road construction, is estimated to cost US$1.6 million; it would not
be suitable for contract work and would be carried out by the project organiza-
tion on force account.   The on-farm works, estimated to cost US$2.5 million,
would need to be planned and executed at short notice to coincide with the
acceptance of boundary realignment schemes by the landholders, as well as to
avoid the growing season and adverse weather conditions.  For these reasons
the on-farm works cannot be grouped into contracts of sufficient size to be
attractive to international contrac.ors.   Since Thai contractors have not
previously had experience with on-farm works on a large scale, up to 75% of these
works would be carried out by the project organization on force account and the
balance would be tendered after local advertising using normal Government
procedures.   In this way the Government expects to be able to begin developing
the necessary capacity in the private sector capable of carrying out similar
projects elsewhere in Thailand.
27.       House and office buildings (US$0.3 million) would be tendered locally
since these structures have to be completed prior to the start of construction
of civil works and the amount involved would not attract international competition
Procedures for local bidding are satisfactory and there is sufficient competition
for works of this kind and size.   Procurement of vehicles and equipment
(US$2.0 million) would be subject to international competitive bidding.  A
15% preference margin, or the prevailing customs duty if lower, would be extended
to local manufacturers of vehicles and equipment in the evaluation of bids.
Small off-the-shelf items costing less than US$5,0o0 each would be purchased
through normal Government procurement procedures.   Such purchases would be
limited to a total of uS$50,ooo.   The Project Director, with the assistance
of consultants, would be responsible for the preparation of all contract
documents, the evaluation of bids and the award of contracts.
Disbursements
28.       Disbursements out of the credit would be fcr the cif cost of directly
imported equipment, or the ex-factory price net of taxes for equipment manu-
factured locally, and at the rate of 65% of the price of such equipment if
procured through local dealers.   For consultant services, disbursements would
cover the actual foreign exchange cost.   Disbursements for civil works would
be on the basis of 35% of total expenditures.   The estimated schedule of
disbursements is presented in Annex III.   It is expected that disbursements
will be completed by June 30, 1978, about one year after the completion of
project construction.

Cost Recovery
29.       The Government has decided that, for all new irrigation projects, where
farmers are ensured a reliable supply of water, it will recover all operation and
maintenance costs and as much as possible of the investment eost directly from
the beneficiaries without impairing their incentive.    in order to establish the
appropriate levels of such charges and the procedures for collecting them, the
Government has undertaken to carry out as part of the project a cost recovery
study.   On the basis of this study the Government will, within two years,
establish appropriate levels of charges, satisfactory to the Association and
will impose and commence collecting such charges in the project area within two
years after completion of the project.
Benefits
30.       The Chao Phya Improvement Project aims to increase yields (mainly of
rice) through better water control by making dry-season cropping possible, and
by providing the necessary agricultural supporting services.
31.       The main benefit of the project would be increased production of
rice and, to a lesser extent, of soybeans, mungbeans and peanuts.    The net
value of incremental producticin to the economy would be g32$5 million (US$1.6
million) per year at full development, expected to be reached in about eight
years.   The increased production of rice would both help to satisfy future
domestic requirements and provide for additional exports, while the production
of soybeans, mungbeans and groundnuts would mainly substitute for imports.
Other important benefits, such as the effects of training and demonstration
for future projects, have not been quantified.   Based on a 30-year project
life and taking into consideration expected world market prices for the crops
produced, the best estimate of the economic rate of return on the project is
about 15'.   In the economic analysis it was assumed that the opportunity cost
of all farm labor equalled the wage rate for hired labor during peak periods and
one-fifth of that value at other times.   A sensitivity analysis was carried out
to examine the economic returns from the project under various adverse conditions
and in each case the rate of return was above 13%.
32.       Past investments in the Bhumiphol and Sirikit. dams, the Chainat
diversion dam and the irrigation and drainage network, all of which would con-
tribute to the realisation of benefits from the project, have been excluded
from the economic analysis in the preceding paragraph.   Even after taking these
investments into account, the economic rate of return on the project still
exceeds 11p.
33.      lWith about 6,600 families in the project area engaged in agriculture,
the available labor force is about 15,000 man-years of which, on average, only
some 5,000 man-years are utilized under present cropping conditionis.  At full
development, however, when cultivation methods for wet-season rice would have
irmroved and 60% of the project area would be cropped in the dry season,
utilization of labor would increase almost threefold, reaching about 14,000



-9-
man-years per annum.   This includes an expanded use of hired labor, estimated
at about 15% of total labor requirements (up to 30% during peak periods).   It
also takes into account the introduction of cultivation methods and the use of
farm machinery which would even out the demand for labor at peak periods. The
project would thus utilize more fully the labor force in the project area which
has few alternative employment opportunities.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY.
3h.       The draft Credit Agreement between the Association and the Kingdom of
Thailand, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article V, Section
I(d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of the Resolution approving the
proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for credits for irrigation
projects.
35.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
36.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

THE ECONOMY
ZExtract from the President's Report on the Third Education Project distributed
to Executive Directors under cover of a Memorandum from the Secretary (IEDA/R72-13
of March 1, 1973) J
1.        When Thailand's Third Plan (1972-76) began in October 1971, the rate
of economic growth had slowed from the average of 8 percent a year in the 1960's
to around 6 percent.   The balance of payments which had been in surplus was in
deficit and there was concern that the capacity to finance imports would become
a constraint on future expansion.   Since then exports have risen steeply and
this has triggered an economic recovery.   Exports of goods and non-factor ser-
vices increased by 10 percent in 1971 and 29 percent in 1972.    At the same
time imports grew slowly; this combination reduced the external resource deficit
and raised foreign exchange reserves.   However, much of the improvement in the
balance of payments has been due to factors that may not recur, such as abrupt
shifts in external demand for some of Thailand's main exports (rice, kenaf and
sugar) and the revival of services to the US military since mid-1971.
2.        Goverrunent spending and investment by state enterprises have continued
to rise more rapidly than GDP, thus sustaining the growth of the economy.
However, despite rising tax revenues, the current surplus of the Central
Government has diminished because of even more rapid increases in current
spending on security, education and debt service.   The Government will have
to reverse the declining trend of its current surplus, to generate enough
resources for its program of capital expenditure.
Development Policies and Problems
3.        The development objectives of the Third Five-Year Plan, which was
reviewed in detail in the basic economic report are: first, the revival of the
economic growth at or near 7 percent a year while maintaining price and external
stability; second, the expansion of agricultural and industrial export capa-
bilities supported by effective export promotion programs; third, a larger
share of the public development effort for agriculture, education and other
programs of social improvement; fourth, a better regional distribution of
development gains with concern for the Northeast; fifth, programs to develop
institutions designed to channel official external capital into private sector
investment as a means of improving external debt management; and sixth,
improvements in Thailand's economic management, particularly in the fonnulation
of projects and regional programs.
4.        In 1972, the Government began to introduce the improvements in
economic management, development policies and project preparation which are
called for in the Plan.   Perhaps the most important improvements concern
economic management; an administrative reorganization was effected in October
1972 with the aim of improving the administration and coordination of economic
and social services, and was accompanied by strengthening of staff in such
ministries as agriculture, industry and commerce.    The reorganization was

followed by Cabinet appointments under an interim Constitution promulgated
in December 1972.   The regrouping of all agricultural services in one ministry
should make it easier in future to formulate and implement agricultural policies
and programs.   The same applies to trade promotion, transport and communications.
However, further efforts are needed to turn these reforms at the top into lasting
improvements at the departmental and local levels.   The Government, in addition,
introduced legislation and policy changes to facilitate the expansion of manu-
facturing, particularly for export, and to improve the functioning of the capital
market.   Finally, progress was made in project preparation and the Plan program
of external borrowing is on schedule.
5.        The Government is allocating more resources to agriculture and its
services dealing with the sector have just been reorganized; policy-making and
the dissemination of new knowLedge are expected to improve as a result.    Three
main obstacles to the expansion of agricultural production for export exist
and require government action if the ambitious Thiird Plan target for a 30
percent increase in agricultural exports is to be achieved.    The first is the
price of fertilizer to the farmer which is kept high by import restrictions
designed to protect high-cost domestic production.    The second is a premium
charged on rice exports, which had been eliminated in April 1971 but was
reimposed in September 1972 because of a steep increase in rice prices.    The
premium depresses the price paid to the farmer and should be lifted when external
demand conditions warrant it.    The third obstacle to expansion consists of
unsatisfactory institutional arrangements for credit, extension services, land
tenure and land settlement.
6.        In manufacturing,, export prospects look more promising.   Fiscal
incentives to exporters have been introduced and are being used.    An industrial
estates authority has been established recently and duty-free zones for export
may also be established soon.    There is room for further improvements in
Government support for private industrialists, but even so it is expected that
the ambitious Plan targets for the export of manufactures will be exceeded.
7.        In the area of financial management, there is a need to expand domestic
financial institutions which would mobilize long-term savings domestically and
abroad for the financing of private investment.   The Government has already
introduced changes in taxation and regulations that will help contractual
savings institutions to expand.   A start has also been made in strengthening
institutions specializing in the financing of agriculture, small industries
and residential construction which could help riase the level of investment in
these sectors by offering more suitable terms and services to borrowers.
There is also a need for the Government to continue encouraging the expansion
of domestic institutions which borrow on favorable terms from official sources
of external capital for onlending to private investors to finance equipment
imports.   These institutions in part replace foreign suppliers' credit and
thus help reduce the growth of Thailand's external debt service liabilities.
8.        The Government's population policy aims at reducing population growth
to 2.5 percent by 1976, and the dissemination of modern birth control techniques
has made quick progress; but this is a recent development and Thailand will
have to contend with a rapid increase in the working-age population until the
mid-1980's.   Unemployment is frictional and seasonal at present, since Thailand
still has virgin land which is being opened up by many who would other.Ise by
unemployed.   Most new entrants to the labor force become farmers because of the



ANNEX I
Page 5 of 8 Pages
limited job opportunities in other sectors.   However, the supply of cultivable
land may be exhausted as early as the 1980's and it is therefore essential to
implement policies to increase farm employment per unit of land against this
eventuality.   These include measures to raise crop yields, expand irrigation,
and promote other farm activities (livestock, fishing, silk, etc).
9.        Differences in income between urban and rural families are large and
tend to widen.   However, the progress made by rural families during the 1960's
was quite considerable.   The policies prescribed for agriculture would make
for a more equal distribution of income between town and country.    The outlying
regions, which are predominantly agricultural, have lagged behind the Bangkok
area in development and income growth.   Government programs dealing with the
special problems of the less developed regions are furthest advanced in the
Northeast and are under preparation for the North and the South.
The Outlook in 1973
10.       The recovery, which began in 1972 as a result of the steep rise in
export earnings, is expected to gain further momentum in 1973.    With anticipated
increases in private investment and consumer demand, import growth should be rapid.
At the same time, however, exports will probably stagnate because a drought in
the summer of 1972 has reduced the availability of rice, kenaf and especially
maize for export.   The resource gap will therefore begin to widen again, but
an increased inflow of long-term private and public capital is expected to
prevent a significant loss of reserves.
Third Plan Prospects
11.       The recent improvement in Thailand's economic situation and the outlook
for 1973 indicate that the Third Plan target for real GDP growth of 7 percent a
year during 1972-76 is realistic, while foreign exchange reserves will probably
stay above the Plan forecast.   However, the depressive effect that the 1973
setback in agricultural output and exports may exercise on subsequent economic
expansion points to the need for a more active development policy during the
remainder of the Plan period.   Policies and programs designed to promote
production for export should receive first priority, considering the importance
of exports as a determinant of GDP and private investment growth and the trends
in the balance of payments.
12.       The deficit on goods and non-factor services will increase.    Commodity
exports will start rising again after 1973, and the anticipated rapid growth of
tourist receipts should make up for possible declines in receipts from the US
military which are a major source of uncertainty.    However, the growth of
imports which depends largely on the saving effort, the growth of investment
and the speed at which import substitution is promoted, is expected to lead to
a current account deficit of nearly $1.3 billion in 1973-76.
13.       To finance this deficit, an increase in external capital inflows is
needed and the Government's policy is to rely more heavily than in the past on
public, as opposed to private, external borrowing.    The Third Plan target of
about $900 million in new commitments of official loans during 1972-76 was
accepted as a reasonable estimate of Thailand's requirements by the last meeting
of the Consultative Group for Thailand.    This target implies a major effort

in project preparation, which the Government has begun to make with help from
bilateral aid sources and our Regional Mission.   It is also Government policy to
maintain the private sector's freedom of access to private credit sources abroad
and in consequence private capital inflows are expected to rise for financing private
equipment imports.   Since reserves are still at a high level and there is a need
to facilitate private investment, this policy appears appropriate at this juncture.
However, in order to prevent an excessive rise in private external borrowing on
hard terms, it is important that -the Government continue to promote the use of
official credit lines by domestic financial institutions for financing an increasing
share of private equipment importa.   External public and private borrowing during
the Third Plan are expected to cause debt service to rise to 19.2 percent of
exports by 1976.   This would be a heavy but manageable burden on the balance
of payments.   Foreign exchange reserves are projected to decline from $969
million at the end of 1972 to about $750 million by the end of 1976, which would
represent about four months of goods and non-factor services imports at that time.
i4.       Beyond 1976, however. if the predicted trends in exports, imports and
capital inflows continue, reserves would decline further and the growth of
Thailand's debt service burden would become a serious problem for the balance
of payments.   The burden of debt service could be mitigated by a further
increase in the share of official capital in total external borrowings, and
by an acceleration of export growth over and above the rate assumed for the
Third Plan period.   There is little doubt that the former could be achieved,
but a further acceleration of exports would depend on both Thailand's own efforts
and external factors.   If this acceleration could not be realized, the country
would face the prospect of a rather heavy debt burden in the 1980ts and the Government
might be forced in the late 1970's to slow down the econony, unless it were able
to obtain more of its public borrowings on significantly improved terms.    Thus,
Thailand's long-term debt prospects are sufficiently difficult to justify some
financing on concessional terms.   In view of this the members of the Consultative
Group have agreed to a substantial improvement in the terms of their capital
assistance to Thailand.

BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THAILAND
Z xtract from the President's Report on the Third Education Project distributed
to Executive Directors under cover of a Memorandum from the Secretary (IDA/R73-13
of March 1, 1973) J
1.        Since 1950 Thailand has received 26 Bank loans amounting to $464.6
million, net of cancellations.   Most of these have been for transportation
($179.1 million), irrigation ($69.2 million) and power ($91 million), with, in
addition, one for a dual-purpose power and irrigation project ($65.9 million.
The remaining loans have been made for education ($21.4 million), industry
($1.0 million) and telecommunications ($37 million).   A credit of $19.5
million for the Third Education Project was approved by the Executive
Directors on March 13, 1973.   In general, Bank-financed projects have
been carried out in accordance with expectations.    Construction of the
Third Bangkok Port project, financed under Loan 702-TH, began 18 months
behind schedule.   The delay was mainly caused by the time taken by the Port
Authority of Thailand and its consultants to pre-qualify bidders, amend tender
documents and evaluate bids which were complicated by currency realignments.
2.        For the next few years, about half the Bank's lending program for
Thailand will be directed to projects in transport, power, water supply and
communications.   Irrigation development will also be a major feature.    But
projects in education, family planning, agricultural credit, industry and tourism
will broaden the spectrum of the program although they will account for lesser
amounts.   Both Bank and IDA projects are increasingly selected to achieve a
wider geographical spread for development benefits.    One of the main functions
of the Regional Mission recently established in Bangkok is to assist the Govern-
ment in developing projects which will contribute to this.    The Bank's readi-
ness to finance some local costs in appropriate cases will enable it to
participate more fully in base-level projects in agricul ure and the social
sector.   A Consultative Group for Thailand, which is chaired by the Bank, met
last in February 1972 and will meet again in April 1973.
3.        During the balance of the current fiscal year, I expect to present for
your consideration a loan of $15.0 million for the fourth railway project, and a
loan of about $42 million for the Bangkok water supply project for which the
Asian Development Bank is also considering a loan of $17 million.    A Northeast
crop improvement project, the Phitsanulok irrigation project, and the multi-
purpose Quae Yai project, all of which are being appraised, should be ready for
your consideration in 1974.    Other projects under consideration for FY74 include
seed multiplication, industrial finance, industrial estates, port development
and urban infrastructure in northeast Thailand.    The Government of Japan,
which in April 1972 signed a  64 billion equivalent credit agreement with the
Government of Thailand, has expressed an interest in participating in the
financing of the Phitsanulok irrigation project and the Quae Yai project.
This should be facilitated by the decision recently announced by the Japanese
Government that it will fully untie loans extended to Thailand for developnent
projects.   Other lenders to Thailand are planning to increase their commit-
ments under the Third Plan.

4.        On December 31, 1972 Bank loans disbursed and outstanding to Thailand
amounted to $196 million, representing 22 percent of the country's total exter-
nal debt of $893 million.    The level of Bank/IDA commitments is expected to
increase substantially over the next five years, but loans and credits disbursed
and outstanding are not expected to exceed 30 percent of the projected external
debt by 1978.
5.        Prospects for IFC operations in Thailand look reasonably good and
investments in a pulp project and aluminium sheet and foil manufacturing are
under consideration.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan 471-TH- First Education ProJect (Vocational Education)
Closing date:  August 31, 1973
1.        The original closing date, June 30, 1970, was postponed to February 22,
1972 due to delays in appointing experts under bilateral assistance.    A further
postponement was necessary as a result of incomplete bidding for tools and
scientific equipment.   It is expected that the project will be satisfactorily
completed by mid-1973.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
programs of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to pre;e,nt a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Loan 514-TH, Sirikit Dam Project
Closing date: June 30, 1973
2.       The work on the project has been practically completed.   The closure
of the dam was carried out on schedule in June 1971.   The reservoir is expected
to be filled to full retention capacity this month.   The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$78 million, as against US$76 million at appraisal
(+2.5%).   Substantial increases in the principal civil works contract (+41%),
which resulted from unforeseen adverse foundation conditions, have been largely
compensated by savings on other items.
Loan 535-TH, Third Highways Project
Closing date: March 31, 1973
3.        The project has been largely completed.   At the request of the
Highways Department the closing date of the loan has been extended by a period
of six months until March 31, 1973, to allow for the completion of work, the
settlement of outstanding payments on construction contracts already carried
out and the payment of consultants costs for completing the design of feeder
roads to be constructed under theproposed 5th Highways project.    $4.0
million has been cancellod, at the request of the Government, from the
unallocated category of this loan.
Loan 626-TH, 4th Highway Project
Closing date: December 31, 1973
4.        Construction of the project is on schedule and within the cost estimates.
At the request of the Government $3.0 million has been cancelled from the unalloca-
ted category of this loan.
Loan 655-TH, First EGAT Power Project
Closing Date: December 31. 1974
5.        Three months behind schedule but otherwise proceeding as expected.
Foreign exchange expenditures are likely to exceed estimates made during
appraisal due mainly to revaluation of the Yen.
Loan 702-TH, Third Bangkok Port Project
Closing date: July 31, 1974
6.        Construction of this project began 18 months behind schedule.    The
delay was mainly caused by the time taken by the Port Authority of Thailand and
its consultants to pre-qualify bidders, amend tender documents and evaluate
bids which were complicated by currency realignments.
Loan 790-TH, South Bangkok Thermal Unit No 4 Project
Closing date: November 30, 1976
7.        Two months behind schedule, but otherwise proceeding as expected.
