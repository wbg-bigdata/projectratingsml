I. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR IN COLOMBIA
Background and Organization
1.01      Colombia has a population of about 24 million distributed over a
number of distinct regions divided principally by mountain ridges. High
mountain chains isolate the densely populated districts from each other and
the coast; the sparsely populated districts cover a large part of the country
and extend into the Amazon forests. About half the population is urban; more
than a quarter live in the four main cities of Bogota, Medellin, Cali and
Barranquilla, all of which are important administrative and manufacturing
centers.
1.02      At present, there are 38 telecommunications companies 1/ in Colombia--
34 are owned and operated by local municipalities and a department (Antioquia)
government, three by associated companies, 2/ and one by Empresa Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones (TELECOM). The municipal-owned companies provide only
local telephone service, while the department-owned company provides local and
long distance facilities within its territorial limit. TELECOM, which is a
state-owned autonomous company, mainly operates all domestic long distance
telecommunications (except the long distance facilites mentioned above); local
telephone services in some municipal areas; and all international telecommuni-
cations services. TELECOM has, in the past, purchased a number of small- and
medium-size former municipal telephone companies; and is now continuing the
integration process either through purchase of other small companies, or by
association. TELECOM is also currently executing a sizeable rural telephone
program.
Access to and Quality of Service
1.03      The telephone density in Colombia (2.4 per 100 population at the
time of the Bank's first loan in 1967) has increased as of January 1, 1978,
to 5.6 telephones per 100 population which is above the average for Latin
American countries. Local telepnone service is concentrated in nine large
cities which have about 70% of the total telephones in the country. Out of
about 4,500 rural communities, only about 500 have access to telephones.
Annex 1 sets out international telephone statistics.
1.04      As of January 1, 1978, the local telephone systems in Colombia had
about 1,400,000 telephones. The registered unfilled demand is estimated at about
250,000. Lack of adequate expansion has resulted in a heavy overload of the
call-handling capacity of the equipment resulting in widespread network congestion
1/   In 1970, 66 companies operated services in Colombia.  With Bank encourage-
ment for sector integration, the number has been reduced to 38 in 1979.
2/   Associated companies are owned by the local municipalities and TELECOM--
the latter holding more than 51% of the share capital and thereby having
controlling interest in these companies.

and subscriber dissatisfaction. Despite considerable improvement in long
distance communications, which in recent years expanded to a 20% annual rate
partly as a result of four Bank operations, the quality of service still
remains deficient. Call traffic congestion has continued as the surge of
traffic which accompanied service improvement continually exceeded capacity.
Sector Problems
1.05      The fragmentation of telecommunications operations into numerous
companies in Colombia has resulted in large systemic and organizational
diseconomies. Many of these entities have neither the capacity nor the
organization to adequately manage their operations, and to plan and implement
an effective expansion or rehabilitation plan.  Small-scale purchases made
independently by each company, and inadequate procurement practices have led
to high capital and operating costs. Most of the operating companies are in
continuous financial difficulties, due to poor financial discipline and organi-
zation; use of excessive short-term financing; and inadequate tariffs. The
central government undertakes the coordination functions which are necessary
due to sector fragmentation, but this in turn further introduces excessive
delays. The planning (where carried out) and implementation of expansion
programs is protracted and inefficient.
The Bank's Role
1.06      The Bank's strategy in lending for the telecommunications sector in
Colombia has been to promote, as a long-term goal, the integration of the
sector under TELECOM. However, the more likely final outcome (due to late
start in sector integration and recent large-scale expansions in some of
the largest local companies) would be the consolidation of all local services
within TELECOM, with the exception of the five largest companies. These
five existing largest local telephone companies at Bogota, Cali, Medellin,
Barranquilla and Bucaramanga would continue to operate services in these
cities as at present, and to serve municipalities and towns in contiguous
surrounding areas. The extension of Bank sector recommendations is consistent
with the overall strategy for consolidation and will enable the primary bene-
fits of integration to materialize.
1.07      The Bank has so far been involved in four telecommunications lending
operations in Colombia. Three loans were made to TELECOM for the expansion
and improvement of the long distance network; the extension of local telephone
service to small towns where the local municipalities could not invest the
sector and requested TELECOM to do so; and institutional development and
strengthening of TELECOM.
1.08      The Bank's role in the fourth loan, also made to TELECOM, addition-
ally stressed the importance and acceleration of the process of sector inte-
gration by providing long-term financing through TELECOM to assist in the
expansion of existing local companies, after TELECOM purchased them or obtained
a controlling interest in them. Bank participation thus makes a considerable
contribution to the rational development of the sector and to institution

building with a consequent improvement in service and reduction in operating
costs resulting from standardization and consolidation of operations. Procure-
ment of large quantities of goods at one time through international competitive
bidding also results in significant savings in equipment costs.
1.09      The audit report on the first project issued on July 19, 1976, while
holding an overall positive view of the Bank's achievements, pointed out delays
in project implementation caused by poor planning and project management.
Another comment related to the continuing unsatisfactory position of the
accounts receivable pertaining to the local entities and the Government. The
audit report on the second project which was issued on June 1, 1979, regarded
the project as successful both in its physical and institution building achieve-
ments. It also noticed the poor collection performance which persisted even
though Bank took action on numerous occasions, but mentioned that the problem
did not lend itself to easy resolution. It further stated that there had been
some improvement, and over the longer term, the problem should diminish pro-
gressively with the wider introduction of toll ticketting and TELECOM's further
acquisitions or associations with local companies. The proposed Bank loan is
the first for EPM's telephone department. EPM does not have any significant
problems either with the collection of dues, or for payment of its dues to
TELECOM and EDA (paragraphs 5.10 and 5.11).
II. THE PROJECT AREA SUBSECTOR
Background and Organization
2.01      Medellin is the capital city and the principal administrative, indus-
trial and educational center of the department of Antioquia. Metropolitan
Medellin (which includes the municipality of Medellin, and other adjacent
municipalities) constitutes the densely congested urban area which occupies
the Aburra Valley in the Central Cordillera--1,500 meters above sea level and
almost a day's road distance from either Bogota or the coastal cities. With
about 1.8 million inhabitants, metropolitan Medellin is Colombia's second
largest city. It is also the country's second most important industrial
center, accounting for about 23% of the industrial work force and 19% of its
output.
2.02      Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM), the second largest telecommuni-
cations entity in Colombia, is the proposed borrower. EPM operates the
electric power; water and sewerage; and telephone utilities within the muni-
cipal limits of Medellin, and in addition operates telephone services in nine
adjacent urban and rural areas under other municipalities at their request.
Access to Service
2.03      As of January 1, 1980, EPM operated 217,330 main telephones in 29
exchanges located in the municipalities of Medellin (172,351), Bello (12,094),
Envigado (10,360), Itagui (11,544), Estrella (1,579), Sabaneta (1,366),
Copacabana (2,675), Girardota (1,056), Caldas (1,895) and Rionegro (2,410).

Telephone penetration averaged about 17 per 100 inhabitants 1/, which is the
highest in any Colombian city although lower than in several other cities of
comparable size in the developing world (e.g., Singapore 20, Caracas 19,
Montevideo 18). The local telephone system is fully automatized, and national
direct distance dialing is available to all subscribers. Subscribers 'may,
however, have themselves disconnected from the automatic long distance service
at no additional cost. All subscribers have access to operator assisted
(manual and semi-automatic) long distance and international service. In order
to obtain a telephone connection, a potential subscriber must register on a
waiting list. Connections are made (subject to availability of exchange and
cable capacity) in the order of registration.
2.04      As of October 31, 1979, there were about 43,000 applicants on the
waiting lists for new connections in EPM's areas of operation. This is equiva-
lent to the net increase in main telephones during the last three years. A
review of the waiting list register (which is updated about once a month)
shows a significant proportion of applications pending from the mid-1970s,
while several are as old as late-1960s. The equipment capacity and number of
connections as of year--end 1978 and 1979, and forecast for year-end 1980
through 1984 on completion of the project is set out at Annex 2. Basic data
as of end 1979 and estimates as of end 1984 are set out at Annex 3. The map
sets out the local telephone system in Medellin.
Telephone Service Usage
2.05      As of January 1, 1979, about 77% of the total number of connections
(excluding public call telephones) were classified as residential, and the
balance of 23% as business (industrial, commercial, professional and govern-
ment). The number of public call office telephones was about 3,400. Call
traffic generated in the whole of the telephone system (based on call pulses)
by the business connections accounted for about 52% of the total. The impact
of business-related usage on the system is, however, much greater than is
shown by these statistics, since business, and residential connections used
for business purposes, generate a high proportion of the traffic during the
peak business hours, and the provision for an adequate grade of service to
cater for this traffic is the primary determinant of system capacity costs.
Quality of Service
2.06      Local service in Medellin is significantly congested.  During peak
traffic hours, only 46% of local call attempts are successful; 20% of call
attempts are lost due to the called party being busy. Congestion is partly
caused by telephone over utilization by existing subscribers and by others
currently on the waiting list; and by the necessity to make numerous repeti-
tive calls to busy subscribers during peak traffic hours.
1/   Assuming 1.2 telephones per direct connection.  Subscriber extension
telephones are provided by EPM and by the subscribers themselves--thus
the exact total number of extension telephones is not known.

Demand for Service
2.07      Two major aspects of the municipal and department strategies have
a strong bearing on sector consolidation and the future telephone service
demand in and around Medellin. In Bello municipality, where EPM currently
provides service, a new residential and commercial urban complex is proposed
to be built at Niquia, which is projected to have a total population of about
80,000 in 1990. The main thrust of metropolitan Medellin's development is,
however, directed toward the neighboring Oriente Cercano region which is
connected to the Aburra Valley by a stretch of the Medellin-Bogota highway.
The present airport at Medellin will be shifted to the nearby Rionegro area
(EPM operates Rionegro telephone services) where it will operate from 1983,
and where a free trade and industrial zone will be established. These facili-
ties, together with availability and relatively low cost of land and labor,
special development financing, and tax incentives and other factors, are
expected to result in (a) some Aburra Valley industries moving or expanding
into the Oriente Cercano region; (b) new industries being created there; (c) a
strengthening of existing agriculture, agroindustry, and traditional manufac-
turing addressed both to domestic consumption and exports; and (d) the asso-
ciated development of housing and services. The Oriente Cercano area is thus
likely to become a focal point of development for the whole department of
Antioquia.
2.08      EPM has taken these regional development plans into consideration
when forecasting demand and planning plant provisions. The demand for main
connections has been forecast year by year from 1979 through 1990 for each
exchange area. The methodology used, which is based on the well-established
block-by-block analysis, uses parameters which are updated in the light of
local experience and has proven to be fairly accurate in the past, even though
such demand has not been fully met.
2.09      Forecast and actual demand and the number of connections for Medellin
and the surrounding areas at year end from 1978 through 1984 are as follows:
1978      1979      1980      1981     1982      1983     1984
(actual) (actual)
Demand            234,900  250,900  260,100  286,500  306-,300  327,500  350,400
Connections       206,813  217,330  224,300  238,700  262,200  291,700  326,000
Subsector Goals
2.10      EPM's goals relating to the telecommunications sector revolve around
improving the quality of service in the areas currently served by EPM; enabling
the future extension of service beyond EPM's operational area toward the
objective of consolidating service in the region around Medellin; improving
organization and management; and reducing overall sector procurement costs and
consequently foreign exchange expenditures. EPM currently serves Medellin



- 6 -
and nine adjacent municipal areas.  EDA serves the other areas in the region
but the service particularly around Medellin is limited due to small capacity
of exchanges installed. In addition, all calls between Medellin and the
EDA served areas are charged as long distance. Two additional municipalities
at San Pedro and Barbosa have recently requested EPM to operate telephone
services in their territories. Thiis would allow for the upgrading of service
and a reduction in the call charges to the Medellin metropolitan area.  After
EPM extends its facilities under this project in Rionegro and in the areas
lying between Oriente Cercano and the Aburra Valley, there will be the possi-
bility for the quick inclusion of a number of additional municipal areas in
the region especially in the Oriente Cercano area (including the municipalities
of Carmen de Viboral, Guarne, La Ceja, Marinitla, Retiro and Santuario with a
combined population of about 110,000 in 1979--all these areas are indicated
as priority areas in the department development strategy) at a relatively low
cost.
Bank's Role
2.11      World Bank involvement in financing part of EPM's telephone develop-
ment program is justified, mainly in terms of improving services in outlying
areas in preparation for further subsector consolidation (paragraph 1.06),
cost reductions largely through economies of scale brought about by sector
consolidation and equipment procurement by international competitive bidding
(paragraph 2.14), rationalization of tariffs (paragraph 4.09), and improvement
of EPM's organization (paragraph 5.03).
2.12      During the period that the Bank has been involved in Colombian
telecommunications (paragraphs 1.06-1.08), the Bank has pursued the need for
sector integration, and has brought about change in this direction through a
sector review in 1975 requested by government and through provisions under
four loans to TELECOM. However, since a part of the sector will at best
consolidate around several major operating companies as in the case of EPM,
direct Bank involvement in large municipal entities, such as EPM, will
accelerate the process of areas like those around Medellin being absorbed
within the Medellin network.
2.13      In addition, EPM's internal organization should be strengthened at
this stage in its development in order to provide for the more effective and
efficient management of its growing telephone service. The Bank's presence
and advice in this effort would assure that adequate attention is given to the
planning and development, operations and the financial function within EPM.
Appointing a separate manager for dealing with technical, operations and
financial matters of the telecommunications department would be the first
step to strengthen EPM's telecommunications management.
2.14      Finally, Bank involvement in EPM should result in substantial
reduction in the cost of imported equipment by improving EPM's procurement
practices, expanding the use of international competition, and ensuring
independent finance and scrutiny. Bank guidance to EPM in the preparation of
bid documents and technical specification for local exchange switching equip-
ment and for telephone instruments has already assisted EPM's management in
expediting bid processing.

III. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01      EPM has prepared a master telephone development program for the
11-year (1980-90) period. This program aims to increase the number of connec-
tions from about 217,000 at year end 1979 to about 506,000 at year end 1990--an
annual growth rate of about 8.1% similar to that experienced in the previous
decade. Besides this expansion of services to urban and rural areas, the
program provides for the installation of a substantial number of additional
public call office telephones (paragraph 4.05). The program is planned for
execution in two phases, i.e., 1980-84 and 1985-90. EPM has finalized the
program for the five-year (1980-84) period which comprises the following main
items:
(a) ongoing works for installation of exchange equipment and
associated cables, and construction of equipment buildings;
(b) acquisition of vehicles;
(c) the project for Bank financing (paragraph 3.03); and
(d) preinvestment for extension of existing equipment, and
of that proposed to be installed under the project; the
extension equipment which is proposed to be partly procured
during 1983 and 1984 is planned for installation in the
first two (1985-86) years of the second phase (1985-90)
program.
Contracts for ongoing works have been signed. The contracts cover the supply
of about 48,600 lines of exchange equipment, and of cables for connection of
about 10,000 additional lines. About 42,600 exchange equipment lines would be
commissioned by end 1981, and the balance of 6,000 lines would be brought into
use by end 1982. The building works would be completed progressively from
1980 through 1982.
3.02      The program is estimated to cost about Col$9,008.2 million
(US$160.3 million) including a foreign exchange expenditure of about US$101.2
million equivalent. Annual program costs from 1980 through 1984 are set out
at Annex 4.
The Project
3.03      The objectives of the project are to meet partly the demands for
telephone service, and to improve the quality of service. The current defi-
ciencies in these areas are set out in paras. 2.04 and 2.06. The project
proposed for Bank financing is a high priority, self-contained part of EPM's
1980-84 development program. It provides for a balanced and integrated
development of local telephone facilities and will be carried out between 1980
and 1984. The project consists of the following installations:



- 8 -
(a)  a total of about 108,400 additional local equipment lines in
Medellin and in the surrounding areas, with associated cables
and subscribers' plant, and about 90,000 additional connections;
(b)  cables and subscribers' plant (for which exchange equipment
has already been contracted) to enable the installation of
another about 10,000 connections;
(c)  3,300 public call telephones to serve largely urban and rural
low economic level communities; and
(d)  building extensions to house project equipment.
Project Cost
3.04      The total cost of the project is estimated at about Col$6,313.7
million (US$110.0 million) including a foreign exchange expenditure of about
US$67.7 million equivalent. Project costs, which are shown in detail in
Annex 4, are summarized as follows:
Col$ million                  US$ million

3.05      The project costs are based on estimated December 1979 prices, which
in turn have been based on the experience of similar equipment procured by EPM
and by other companies operating in Colombia through December 1978 and then
adjusted for inflation during 1979. The project costs are reasonable. EPM is
exempt from payment of customs duties on imported goods, and of any other taxes
on procured goods.



-9-
Contingencies
3.06       Price contingencies included in project costs amount to 36% of the
total of base and physical contingency costs. They result from the year-by-
year estimated local cost increases of: 1980 - 22.5%, 1981 - 18.0%, and
15% annually from 1982 through 1984; and the year-by-year estimnated annual
foreign cost increases of 10.5% in 1980; 9% in 1981, 8% in 1982, and 7%
annually from 1983 through 1984. These contingency estimates as well as the
projected exchange rates are in accordance with expectations for projects in
Colombia.
3.07      Except for variations in quantities, which could occur in building
construction and cable ducting works, and for which a physical contingency
amounting to 7% of local costs has been provided, no other physical contingen-
cies are considered necessary. Provision of local exchange lines and of
telephones are based on detailed engineering and forecasts of equipment
quantities. In the case of cable networks, the dispersion of these networks
throughout the system permits flexibility and adjustments, which make provision
of physical contingencies unnecessary.
Items and Sources of Financing
3.08      Of the project's foreign cost of US$67.7 million, the proposed Bank
loan would provide US$44 million; suppliers would provide US$11.5 million;
commercial banks would provide US$9.9 million and the balance of US$2.3 million
would be from EPM's own funds. The local cost of about US$42.3 million equiva-
lent would be provided through EPM's internal cash generation.
3.09      The items for Bank financing (including CIF) in US$ million are as
follows:
Local exchange equipment    18.7
Cables                        13.3
Telephones                     3.4
Call office telephones          1.9
Contingencies                  6.7
Total                      44.0
Procurement
3.10      All Bank financed goods would be procured through international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank's guidelines. Of the goods pro-
posed to be procured using Bank financing, cables are locally manufactured.
EPM considers that some telephones and local switching equipment could also be
under manufacture locally. Qualified local manufacturers would be allowed a
preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the CIF price, or the existing rate of
duty, whichever is lower. EPM proposes to obtain extension to equipment
earlier obtained through suppliers credits, from the existing manufacturers
using suppliers credits. All other imported goods would be obtained through
international competitive bidding and financed by EPM's resources, and



- 10 -
commercial bank loans (paragraph 3.08). Other goods which are manufactured
locally like outdoor line and cable fitting materials, and ducts would be
obtained through local competitive bids and financed by EPM's funds. The
arrangement for local bidding permits competition and is satisfactory.
Project Implementation
3.11      The proposed schedule for project execution as set out in Annexes 5
and 6 is realistic. EPM's staff are preparing engineering designs for all
equipment.  EPM has prepared bid documents and technical specifications for all
Bank-financed goods, and these have been reviewed in the Bank. Bids for all
these goods are expected to be called by end March 1980. EPM would lay and
commission all local distribution and interoffice cables, and would supervise
the construction of cable ducts by local contractors. All installation work
would be carried out by EPM's technical staff, except in the case of new and
sophisticated type of switching equipment, where EPM's staff would assist the
contractor's staff. Building extensions to house project equipment will be
constructed by EPM's staff. EPM's management is sufficiently experienced and
is competent to carry out the project satisfactorily. The project is expected
to be completed by December 31, 1984.
Disbursements
3.12      The estimated disbursements schedule for the Bank loan is set out in
Annex 7. Disbursements would be made for 100% of the CIF cost of the imported
equipment and the foreign costs of its installation. In the case of cables
(and, if applicable, telephones and switching equipment), disbursements would
be for 100% of foreign expenditure and for 94% 1/ of local expenditures. All
disbursements would be fully documented. The closing date of the loan would be
June 30, 1985.
Performance Indicators
3.13      Indicators which would assist in monitoring EPM's project implementa-
tion, and operational and financial performance are set out in Annex 8. These
indicators were discussed and agreed upon during loan negotiations. EPM
would include the indicators in its project progress reports to the Bank for
the period ending December 31 of each year.
IV. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
4.01      The economic analysis relates primarily to EPM's 1980-84 telecommun-
ications investment program, of which Bank-financed project is an integral
part.
1/   The balance 6% of local expenditures represents local taxes.



- 11 -
Telecommunications and Development
4.02      Usage of the existing telephone service in Medellin is heavy with
substantial waiting lists and suppressed demand and with traffic congestion in
peak hours (paragraphs 2.04 and 2.06). EPM has taken into account existing
and growing 'uture demands for telephone access in Medellin and surrounding
areas and prepared its telephone investment program to support these and other
local and regional development efforts. However, owing to the limitations of
the available resources, the forecast demand is not expected to be met at the
end of the project period in 1984 (paragraph 2.09).
4.03      The Bank-financed project is the first phase of a telephone devel-
opment program, containing the highest priority works which will contribute
substantially to achieving the sector's objectives outlined in paragraph 2.10.
It will pave the way for additional sector consolidation, and expand and
improve the quality of EPM's telephone service in Medellin and the surrounding
areas, thereby improving regional administrative, social and economic services.
The Distributions of Benefits
4.04      There are both efficiency and equity aspects to the distribution
of benefits from the proposed telecommunications program. With regard to
promoting economic efficiency, the relatively high business tariffs will help
to ensure that, in areas with service, those commercial subscribers who are
willing to pay the highest prices for telephones (and therefore who presumably
incur the most benefits from having a telephone) can get one within, at most,
one or two years of application. The primary dominance of the network by
commercial usage is unlikely to change significantly over the program period.
The program is designed to give priority and to expand telephone services in
areas which have longer waiting lists and higher per-line revenue.
4.05      With regard to the equity aspects of the program, telephone service
will be provided to various categories of residential subscribers who will be
charged partly based on the value of their property--the higher the property
value, the higher the telephone rental. About 70% of the planned investment
is to be used in meeting the demand from middle- and lower-income households.
Additionally, about 2,900 out of the 3,300 PCOs will be installed in the
economically weaker population areas in an attempt to assure that all segments
of the population have access to rapid two-way communications services.
4.06      As required by the municipality of Medellin, EPM pays to the muni-
cipality an annual contribution, part of which is attributable to EPM's
telephone operations. During the project period 1980-84, the contribution
from EPM's Telephone Department operation to the general revenues of the munici-
pality is estimated at about Col$293.0 million (US$5.0 million) to be utilized
by the municipality for other public services in the greater metropolitan area
of Medellin.
Tariff Policy
4.07      EPM's telecommunications rental and deposit charges distinguish
between residential, industrial/commercial, and other subscribers. For
residential subscribers, such charges are set according to the residential
property's value (paragraph 4.05).



- 12 -
4.08       Local calls are timed--a pulse at an average of every 120 seconds.
For long distance calls, per kilometer charges decrease with distance, reflect-
ing the decreasing costs. The corresponding three-minute manual call rate is
higher than a three-minute automatic (STD) rate, to reflect additional manual
operating costs. Also, for long distance, two charging rates (a day rate and a
lower rate for nights and weekends) are used on automatic service, and three
charging rates (day, mid-day period, and night) are used on manual long
distance service. The night and weekend rate reflects the lower marginal cost
of carrying traffic outside of the busy periods since the system was designed
for peak hour usage. The higher daytime tariff ensures that those (primarily
business and government) who have the greatest need at peak times will pay a
price which more closely reflects the costs which they impose on the system.
In contrast to this, public call office users, who are generally low income
individuals, are charged about 40% less per metered pulse than regular sub-
scribers. A summary of tariffs is set out in Annex 9.
Tariff Study
4.09       It is proposed that in the course of project execution EPM undertakes
a tariff study with Bank guidance and assistance. EPM plans to meet more
than  i0% or curreuLc and fuLure demand, a.,d about 3,300 additional PCOs will be
installed throughout the 1980-1990 program period, thus making telephone
access available to virtually the whole population in EPM's operational area.
Consequently for both economic efficiency and social equity reasons, it is
nccessary that EPM analyzes its telephone tariff structure and investment mix
in relation to incremental costs. By the end of the project period, a tariff
structure which generally reflects incremental expansion costs will be required
in order to attain economic efficiency in the use of existing plant and to
assist in planning the allocation of new investment. Similarly, equity
objectives sought through deviations from efficiency-related marginal cost
pricing require careful analysis.
4.10       Since a similar analysis is starting at TELECOM under Loan 1450-CO,
the study of tariffs in Colombia would then cover both a large local and long
distance entity. As is necessary, this would deal, among other aspects, with
the difficult question of division of revenues between TELECOM and local
companies, which has proven elusive so far, and where the Bank's presence
could enrure fairness to all parties and due attention to economic efficiency.
Assurances have been obtained from EPM that it will (i)-by September 1, 1981
carry out under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank a study on the
strucLure of its telephone tariffs and rates; (ii) by January 31, 1981 furnish
to the Bank for its approval the terms of reference; (iii) by October 31, 1981
discuss with the Bank the conclusions of the study; (iv) by December 15, 1981
prcpare anid furnish to the Bank a program based on the conclusions of the
study; and (v) by April 15, 1982 put the program into effect.
Least-Cost Solution
4.11      The configuration of the existing network and EPM's expansion
p-roposals and service improvement objectives within the 1980-1990 eleven-year
plan (paragraph 3.01) very much limits the number of viable alternative
technical solutions to comply with these targets. The dimensioning and timing



- 13 -
of the works under the 1980-1984 first phase program, of which the Bank
project is an integral part, are based on engineering studies designed to
utilize the latest development techniques and to determine the least-cost
solution for the telephone network.
Return on Investment
4.12      The internal financial rate of return defined as the discount rate
which equalizes the present value of the cost and revenue streams (in 1980
prices) attributable to the program is 15.9% (Annex 10).  Using a standard
conversion factor of 0.93 and a shadow wage rate ratio of 0.68 provides a
minimum estimate of the economic rate of return of 16.8%.
4.13      The above economic rate of return does not take into account numerous
indirect and external benefits.  It is a minimum estimate based only on
official charges paid by consumers for the services which they receive.
Hence, it significantly understates the real benefits to be derived from
the investment program. In fact, consumers in Medellin in the recent past
were demonstrating that they were willing to pay more for telephone access
and usage than they are currently paying. Since the last tariff increase in
1976, inflation has resulted in prices falling substantially in real terms and
it is projected that they will continue to do so. Consequently considerable
consumer surplus undoubtedly exists.
4.14      Benefits are also understated because the calculation of the internal
rate of return includes costs for extending the network and providing facilities
in the newly served areas, while the full benefits of the extension are not
included. This is because the available capacity of various components of
equipment will not be fully utilized until additional investment is made and
additional lines are connected at some time in the future.
Risk
4.15      The project offers limited risk.  The principal risk is the possibil-
ity of delayed physical implementation due to unforeseen circumstances. In
telecommunications projects, which comprise a relatively large number of
independent activities, delay in the completion of a few works does not gener-
ally prevent the use of other newly created assets. Further costs and benefits
are often delayed in roughly the same degree so that the impact on the rate of
return may not be significant. A sensitivity analysis on the financial rate of
return (Annex 10) indicates that the combination of 10% higher capital and
operating costs and 10% lower revenues would result in an internal financial
rate of return of not less than 11%.
Environment and Health Aspects
4.16      No significant adverse environmental effects are expected from the
project. On the contrary, as the project will provide wider and better
telephone service, the growth in vehicular traffic congestion during business
hours is expected to be reduced, accompanied by a reduction in the growth of
atmospheric pollution. Better access to health and emergency services would
be available to lower income areas with the installation of a large number of
public call offices in these areas.

V. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
General
5.01      In Decreto No. 1816 of 1955, the Government of Colombia authorized
the municipality of Medellin to organize one or several of Medellin's munic-
ipal services as administrative autonomous units, with the objective of
providing energy, telephone, water and sewerage services to Medellin, and to
other municipalities which requested Medellin for such provision. In its
Order No. 58 of 1955, the Medellin municipality laid down rules and regula-
tions for Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM)--the autonomous company created
in accordance with Decreto 1816 of 1955. All assets of the above public
services which had been the municipality's property, were also transferred
as EPM's assets. EPM currently operates telephone services in the Medellin
municipal area, and in nine other adjacent urban and rural areas under the
jurisdiction of their respective municipalities. The Bank has participated
in four of EPM's power projects.
Organization
5.02      EPM is administererd by a seven-member board of directors with the
Mayor of Medellin as the chairman. The general manager, appointed by the
board of directors, is responsible for EPM's day-to-day management. The
general manager oversees directly the work of (a) four managers responsible
for technical matters, operations, finance and administration, respectively;
(b) the secretary general in charge of legal affairs and archives; and (c) a
planning director in charge of planning and coordination. Below the level of
the managers, the organization is in general separated administratively into
EPM's three departments. Each department works fairly independently of
the others, and separate financial statements are prepared. EPM's board of
directors, however, receives a consolidated financial statement for all
EPM's services. EPM's organizational chart is set out at Annex 11.
5.03      While the present organizational arrangements are satisfactory for
the efficient discharge of EPM's current responsibilities, the set up is
not adequate for the future. EPM is embarking on a large scale expansion
of telephone services in the 11-year (1980-90) period (paragraph 3.01). The
total installed equipment capacity and total connections are proposed to be
increased from 250,000 and from 217,330, respectively, at the end of 1979, to
407,000 and 326,000 at the end of this project in 1984; and to 605,000 and to
506,000 in 1990.  This large scale expansion of local service facilities will
need concentrated and specialized attention to be paid to the planning and
development of facilities, and to post-installation service and maintenance.
Telephone services now need more than ever before specialized attention due to
rapid changes occurring in development and maintenance philosophies, and in
technological advances in the field. Full-time, well informed management
staff to deal only with the telephone services is highly desirable. During
the project period, all telephone services (technical design, telephone
planning, operations, customer services and investment activities) should be
controlled by a manager solely responsible for the Telephone Department. The
technical and operations divisions are currently controlled separately below
the manager's level and could be easily transferred. The customer services,



- 15 -
financial programing (investment), control of telephone directory, purchase
and level of spares, staff and establishment are spread over planning, finan-
cial and administrative divisions, and would need careful study before being
transferred to the separate Telephone Department. With a 40% increase in
operations by 1990 and the expected assimilation of networks distant from
Medellin, the telephone branch of EPM alone would be a sizeable enterprise.
Assurances have been received from EPM that it will (i) by February 28, 1981
carry out under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank a study for
reorganizing the Telephone Department; (ii) by September 30, 1980 furnish
to the Bank for its approval the terms of reference of the study; (iii) furnish
promptly thereafter to the Bank for review the results of the study; (iv) pre-
pare a program for reorganizing the Telephone Department based on the conclu-
sions of the study and Bank's comments thereon; and (v) by September 30, 1981
put into effect the program.
5.04      As of January 1, 1980, EPM's telecommunications staff totaled about
900. EPM operated on that date 217,330 connections with a staff ratio of
about 4.2 per 1,000 telephones. Overall staff productivity is high. However,
the standard of subscriber service is not adequate. While the number of
faults per month is about 13,300 on an average and is not excessive, the
average duration of each fault is high. The percentage of faults repaired
within 24, 48, 72, and over 72 hours, is 38, 32, 10, and 20 respectively.
The productivity of the maintenance staff is currently satisfactory and they
attend to a large number of faults. However, there is considerable carry-over
of faults. Additional maintenance staff could be employed and changes in
fault clearance procedures made to enable at least 60% of the faults to be
cleared on the day of fault occurrence. This will not only greatly increase
subscriber satisfaction, but may also decrease internal congestion in some of
the older exchanges and would certainly increase revenues and system benefits.
EPM's general manager has agreed to consider ways and means to improve fault
clearance including increasing the existing outdoor plant maintenance staff.
Control of fault duration has been discussed with EPM, and agreed targets for
outage time have been included in the performance indicators.
Staff
5.05      During the project period, EPM expects to recruit about 600 addition-
al staff for the Telephone Department. At the end of the project, EPM would
operate about 326,000 telephones with about 1,500 staff. The staff ratio
would be 4.7 per 1,000 telephones. While this ratio will have slightly
deteriorated, efficiency will have increased considerably (paragraph 5.04).
Annex 12 sets out the estimates of the number of employees in each section of
EPM's Telephone Department from 1980 through 1984, the staff pay groups as of
December 31, 1978, and a summary of service conditions. The pay scales are
generally attractive and the requisite quality of staff can be recruited.
Turnover of staff is reported to be negligible.
5.06      EPM's engineering and planning staff are well qualified, are competent
and have considerable experience in project management and operation. Given a
proper organization arrangement (paragraph 5.03), EPM staff qualifications and
experience would enable them to efficiently manage the considerably expanded
operations resulting from the project. EPM's finance and management staff are
also generally well qualified and capable.

Training
5.07      EPM has planned a training center to give courses to administrative
and operational personnel of all EPM's branches and to be fully operational by
end 1980. Building construction is well advanced. After 1980, regular courses
would be undertaken to train new staff and to impart refresher training to
existing staff. At present, EPM has training courses for new staff required
to maintain outside plant and exchange equipment. Outside plant maintenance
staff are given training once a year for various periods depending on staff to
be trained, and is undertaken by releasing one of the existing expert staff.
EPM has trained 55 exchange equipment staff during 1979, at Paris, Medellin
and Bogota to maintain new and existing types of exchange equipment; and
proposes to train a further 21 during 1980. Additionally training is provided
for in bid documents being prepared for Bank-financed telephone equipment, in
Medellin and at the contractor's works. Trained maintenance staff would
be available when project goods are brought into service. The training
arrangements are satisfactory.
Accounting and Audit
5.08      EPM has an accrual accounting system which provides for separate
accounts for each department and is appropriate. Tabulations and reporting
are carried out effectively with the aid of a computer. Monthly financial
statements and budget reports are available promptly, and contain the infor-
mation necessary for management's review.
5.09      EPM's internal audit is adequate.  The auditor is appointed by the
Muncipal Council of Medellin and reports directly to EPM's board of directors
and the Municipality. The annual internal audit report is issued within three
months after the end of the fiscal year. To comply with the Bank's power loan
audit covenant, EPM has engaged independent external auditors to audit the
accounts of all its operations. The auditors have submitted acceptable reports.
Assurances have been obtained from EPM that it will engage an independent
external auditor acceptable to the Bank; and to provide the Bank with a set of
unaudited financial statements within three months after the end of the fiscal
year, and audited financial statements together with the auditor's report
within five months after the end of the fiscal year.
Billing and Collection
5.10      EPM's billing and collection procedures are satisfactory.  Billing is
computerized and subscribers are billed on monthly cycle basis.  Bills become
due about ten days after being received by the subscriber. While a consol-
idated bill for water and sewerage, electricity and telephone services is
prepared, the charge for each service is shown separately. If the subscriber
does not settle the account within three months, all utility services of the
subscriber are disconnected. As a result of EPM's rigid disconnection policy
the level of outstanding and overdue accounts is generally low (paragraph 6.05).



- 17 -
5.11      As in the case of other municipal-owned telephone companies in
Colombia, national long distance and international telephone traffic in
Medellin is handled through TELECOM's facilities. Each month TELECOM bills
EPM for the total number of pulses on all long distance calls registered on
the channel meters on directly dialed national calls; and for m-nual national
and international calls. EPM retains part (about 23%) of the total income on
the long distance and international services, and pays the balance to TELECOM.
EPM bills individual subscribers for the total pulses registered on each
subscriber's meter--these pulses also include pulses on national automatic
long distance calls, and for manual national and international calls. EPM has
an arrangement similar to that with TELECOM with Empresas Departamentales de
Antioquia (EDA) for the long distance telephone service provided by EDA within
the department of Antioquia. These arrangements are acceptable. EPM has made
regular payments to TELECOM and EDA for services rendered.
Insurance
5.12      EPM has insurance coverage for buildings, internal plant and stores,
against fire and special perils. Insurance protection is also maintained for
vehicles, for cash in transit, and personal liability. These arrangements are
satisfactory.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
6.01      EPM's consolidated financial position as well as that of each of its
various departments (Power, Telephone, Water and Sewerage) have been reviewed
and found satisfactory. During 1977 through 1979, the annual debt service
coverage ratio for the consolidated EPM was never below 2.0. The following
table summarizes the financial performance of the consolidated EPM during 1977
through 1979; detailed financial statements for each department as well as EPM
on a consolidated basis are given in Annex 13:

- 18 -
6.02      The projected funds flow of each EPM's departments up to 1984 has
also been reviewed and, on this basis, EPM's forecast future finances have
been found satisfactory; the annual debt service coverage for each department
will not be less than 1.5 (Annexes 14 and 17). According to EPM's current
projections, the future development program of each department will not impose
any financial constraints on the other departments. However, the financial
implications of the other departments on EPM's financial situation as a whole
or on the Telephone Department, have been examined and, where necessary,
appropriate covenants have been included in the proposed loan agreement
(paragraphs 6.08, 6.17, 6.18 and 6.19). Since EPM's accounts and budgets are
maintained separately for each department, a detailed analysis has been made
only for the Telephone Department. Unless otherwise indicated, the following
paragraphs relate only to the Telephone Department.
Past Performance and Present Position
6.03      During 1977-79, the financial performance has been satisfactory; for
the average of this period, internal cash generation has been the main source
of financing and has contributed over 70% of the total funds requirement
during 1977-79, while borrowings have provided the remaining funds. During
the same period, the operating ratio averaged about 68%. The income statements
for the period FYs 1977-79 are presented in Annex 15 and a summary is given
below.

6.04      Despite the adverse effects of inflation and the devaluation of
peso, the estimated EPM financial position attributable to its Telephone
Department as of December 31, 1979 is still satisfactory; the current ratio of
1.7 and the estimated debt/equity ratio of 24/76 reflect a comfortable position.
The actual and forecast financial position for the period 1976 to 1984 is set
out in Annex 16 and the 1979 balance sheet is summarized below:

Accounts Receivable
6.05      EPM's billing and collection policy has been effective (paragraph
5.10). The overall accounts receivable position represents about 60 days of
telephone billing in 1979; this is satisfactory. Inter-departmental accounts
are also settled within two months. To monitor future billing and collection
practice, EPM's telephone subscriber accounts receivable would be included in
the performance indicators (Annex 8).
Revaluation of Assets
6.06      EPM is required by Colombian law to revalue its assets for all
departments only to offset the exchange rate adjustments on its foreign
borrowings. For the purpose of calculating the rate of return, however, EPM's
telephone assets should be revalued to reflect also the impact of general
price inflation on the one hand and the combined effect of new technology
improvement and economies of scale which could reduce the costs of telecom-
munications equipment on the other. EPM's revalued telephone assets in



- 20 -
operation as of December 31, 1979, are estimated to be about Col$3,609 mil-
lion and the annual revaluation of assets has been included in the forecast
for the project period. The average revalued net fixed assets in operation
have then been used as the base to determine the rate of return (Annex 16,
Attachment 1, and Annex 19, paragraph 6). During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from EPM that it would revalue its telephone assets in operation
yearly in accordance with a method acceptable to the Bank, and present to the
Bank yearly summary report on such revaluation within the first three months
of each fiscal year.
Local Telenhone Revenues
6.07      In 1977 and 1978, revenues from local telephone services provided
over 70% of EPM's total operating revenues; revenues from long distance and
international and other services, based on the revenue sharing agreements with
other entities (paragraph 5.11), provided the remaining.
6.08      The National Tariff Board (NTB) has recently approved a tariff
increase program for EPM effective from December 1, 1979 (Annex 9) to produce
about 70% additional revenue from its local telephone services over the
period 1980-81. On the basis of current expectations on inflation, forecasts
indicate that an annual rate of return of 9% on revalued telephone assets
would be sufficient for EPM to meet its Telephone Department's requirements
during 1980-84 and that another tariff increase to generate about 30% addi-
tional local telephone revenues would be necessary only during 1983-84 to meet
the required 9% rate of return, assuming no increase in the charges for long
distance and international services. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained from the Government and EPM that future telephone tariffs would be
maintained at a level sufficient to produce a rate of return of not less than
9% on revalued telephone assets. Furthermore, to ensure that EPM continues
to have sufficient funds to meet the requirements of all its departments,
assurances were also obtained from the Government and EPM that, unless other-
wise agreed by the Bank, EPM would maintain tariffs for the services provided
by each department at a level sufficient to generate revenues to cover the
administrative, operational and debt service requirements and a reasonable
contribution towards the capital investment of that department.

1/   The difference of about US$0.43 million from the proposed loan amount
(US$44.0 million) represents part of the retention money which would be
disbursed during the calendar year 1985.
6.10      During 1980-84, about US$109.6 million is needed for the proposed
project works, and US$50.7 million is for other project works; capitalized
expenses including the interest during construction is about US$16.0 million.
Net internal cash generation will account for about 45% of the funds   require-
ment under the greatly expanded capital investment program (average annual
capital expenditure during 1980-84 is about Col$2,000.0 million as compared
with Col$210.0 million during 1977-79). The total foreign exchange cost
for the 1980-84 program would amount to about US$101. 2 million, of which



- 22 -
US$67.7 million pertains to the proposed project and would be financed partly
by the proposed Bank loan of US$44 million. The remaining foreign exchange
requirements would be financed by other external borrowings and suppliers'
credits and, to a small extent, by EPM's internal sources.
6.11      The proposed Bank loan is assumed at an interest rate of 8.25% per
year plus a commitment charge of 3/4 of 1% with a repayment of 17 years
including 4 years grace period. The terms for other foreign borrowings are
assumed at an annual interest rate of 11.0% and 8.5% for commercial loans
and suppliers, credits respectively, plus a commitment charge of 1/2 of 1%
with a 10 years repayment including 2 years grace period; these terms are
in line with the general terms for EPM's current external borrowings. Local
borrowings are at an annual interest of 15% with two to five years' repayment
period. EPM will finance the balance of its funds requirements from internal
sources. Forecast debt statements for the period 1980-84 are given in Annex
18. During negotiations, the availability of funds for financing the foreign
exchange gap of about US$55 million were confirmed.
Pension and Severance Reserves
6.12      EPM maintains reserve accounts for its pension and severance liabili-
ties according to Colombian law, and pays directly from these accounts to
employees who are terminating their service with EPM. Annual provisions for
these reserves have been sufficient to meet annual payments. The net increase
in these reserves would contribute about four percent of the total financing
sources during 1980-84.
6.13      In addition to low-cost housing loans which EPM provides for its
employees, individual shares in the severance funds can also be utilized
by employees for purchasing residential housing. EPM pays interest on the
severance reserve in line with the rates charged for similar arrangements in
other companies as required by law. These arrangements apply to all EPM's
departments and are appropriate.

6.15      Revenues have been projected according to the new tariff increase
program (paragraph 6.08) and taking into account EPM's past experience and
the effects of plant addition and network expansion during the project period.
Projections for the operating expenses reflect the expanding telephone opera-
tions and include annual inflation provisions. Detailed notes and assumptions
on the projections are given in Annex 19.
6.16      The projections indicate that the expected financial performance
will be satisfactory. Increasing revenues would be sufficient to provide
an acceptable rate of return of at least 9% on the revalued assets. The debt
service coverage and the debt/equity ratio would be adequate. The current
ratio including the current portion of long-term debts would be about 1.0.
Investment Limitation
6.17      To ensure a thorough analysis of the financial impact of any signifi-
cant additional investment beyond the currently proposed 1980-84 telephone
expansion program, EPM agreed during negotiations that it would seek the
Bank's concurrence before undertaking any new capital investment in any one
year during the project period for its telephone operations for an amount
in excess of US$2,000,000.
Fund Utilization Limitation
6.18      To ensure that funds generated by the Telephone Department are not
used to support other departments before meeting its own requirements, assur-
ances were obtained from EPM during negotiations that funds arising out of or
obtained in connection with its telephone operations would not be utilized for
other purposes including transfer to EPM's other departments, except funds in
excess of its Telephone Department's operational, debt service and investment
requirements, including the maintenance of adequate reserves in respect of its
telephone operations. Furthermore, any transferred funds would be treated as
a loan on commercial borrowing terms and conditions.
Debt Limitation
6.19      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from EPM that it would
not incur any long-term debt for any department, without Bank's prior concur-
rence, unless the net revenues arising from that department exceed 1.5 times
the maximum future debt service requirement relating to that department.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached that EPM will:
(a) (i) by September 1, 1981 carry out under terms of reference satis-
factory to the Bank a study on the structure of its telephone
tariffs and rates; (ii) by January 31, 1981 furnish to the Bank
for its approval the terms of reference; (iii) by October 31, 1981
discuss with the Bank the conclusions of the study; (iv) by



- 24 -
December 15, 1981 prepare and furnish to the Bank a program based
on the conclusions of the study; and (v) by April 15, 1982 put
the program into effect (paragraph 4.10);
(b)  (i) by February 28, 1981 carry out under terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank a study for reorganizing the Telephone
Department; (ii) by September 30, 1980 furnish to the Bank for
its approval the terms of reference of the study; (iii) furnish
promptly thereafter to the Bank for review the results of the
study; (iv) prepare a program for reorganizing the Telephone
Department based on the conclusions of the study and Bank's
comments thereon; and (v) by September 30, 1981 put into effect
the program (paragraph 5.03);
(c)  engage an independent external auditor acceptable to the Bank and
provide the Bank with a set of unaudited financial statements
within three months of the close of the fiscal year, and audited
financial statements together with auditor's report within five
months of the close of the fiscal year (paragraph 5.09);
(d) revalue annually its telephone assets in operation according to
methods acceptable to the Bank and present annually to the Bank
a report on such revaluation (paragraph 6.06);
(e) seek the Bank's concurrence before undertaking for its telephone
operation any new capital investment in excess of US$2,000,000
of the provision in the 1980-84 program in any one year during
the project period (paragraph 6.17);
(f) not utilize funds from telephone operations for other purposes
including loans to EPM's other operations, unless such funds are
in excess of all reasonable requirements in respect of the
telephone operations (paragraph 6.18); and
(g) not incur any long-term debt for any department unless the net
revenues from that department exceed 1.5 times of the maximum
future debt service requirements relating to that department
(paragraph 6.19).
7.02      During negotiations, agreement was reached that EPM and Government
will:
(a) maintain EPM's future telephone tariffs at levels sufficient to
produce a rate of return of not less than 9% on telephone assets
revalued according to methods acceptable to the Bank and, in
general, EPM's future tariffs for services provided by each
department would be maintained at levels sufficient to meet
the requirements of that department (paragraph 6.08); and
(b) make available funds on terms and conditions satisfactory to
the Bank to cover any foreign financing gap for EPM's telephone
investment program including the project (paragraph 6.11).
7.03      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IBRD loan
of US$44.0 million equivalent for a term of seventeen years including a four-
year grace period.

Benefit period
1.        The benefit period of the program extends from 1980 to 2009, when
on average the equipment provided under the program is expected to have
substantially completed its useful life.
Capital Expenditures
2.        Capital expenditures are based on the estimated requirements
during the program period (1980-84) excluding preinvestments for the future
program; preinvestments in 1979 for the 1980-84 program are included. All
expenditures are expressed in the 1980 price level.
Operating Revenues and Costs
3.        Incremental revenues assigned to the program are primarily based
on the expected additional telephone subscribers and the traffic increase
brought about by the program. The base revenues in 1979 have been adjusted
to reflect the tariff increases in 1980-81 and 1983-84. Incremental costs
excluding depreciation and interest are based on the additional assets,
traffic and staff requirements expected from the program and the impact of
inflation has been excluded. All revenues and costs have been deflated
with the expected price increase to bring them to the 1980 price level and
make them comparable with the capital expenditures.
Net Benefits
4.        A summary of the program's costs and benefit streams at 1980
price level is given as follows (in million Col$):
Capital         Operating           Net

FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
EMPRESAS PUBLICAS DE MEDELLIN (EPM)
TELEPHONE DEPARTMENT
Notes and Assumptions on the Financial Statements
1.        The financial statements of EPM's Telephone Department, as shown
in Annexes 15 to 18, are primarily based on EPM's pro forma accounts
and the financial projections. The following paragraphs relate to the
main items of the financial statements, and take into account the addi-
tional information obtained during appraisal.
2.        The estimated number of Direct Exchange Lines (DELs) for the
years 1980-84 are as given in Annex 2.
Income Statements
3.        Operating revenues are projected according to the local tele-
phone tariffs increase program recently approved by the National Tariff
Board (NTB) for 1980-81; no increase is projected in the long distance
and international telephone tariffs during 1980-84.
(a) Installation charges are projected on the basis of the
average revenues per subscriber and the estimated net
additions of DELs under residential and non-residential
categories.
(b) Rentals (fixed charges) are projected using the estimated
average DELs during the year under the residential and
non-residential categories.
(c) Local call revenues are projected using the average charge per
impulse of Col$.35 in 1979 plus a monthly increase of Col$.Ol
over the period 1980-81 and remaining constant thereafter.
The number of impulse per residential subscriber is esti-
mated to increase 5% per year for existing subscriber and 2%
per year for new subscribers. For non-residential subscri-
bers, the number of impulse per subscriber is estimated to
increase 7% per year in 1980-81 and 10% per year in 1982-84
for existing subscribers, and 4% per year in 1980-84 for new
subscribers.
(d) Revenues from public call offices (PCOs) are projected to
increase from Col$10 million in 1980 by about 5% per year
and are included in the local call revenues.

ANNEX 19
Page 2 of 5 pages
(e) Long distance revenues are projected on the basis of the esti-
mated growth of traffic and the revenue sharing agreements
between EPM and TELECOM, and between EPM and EDA. According
to the EPM-TELECOM agreement, EPM retains 22.5% of revenues
from long distance automatic services and 20.4% of revenues
from long distance manual services. For long distance auto-
matic and manual service within the Department of Antioquia,
EPM and EDA share the revenues on a 25/75 basis. The pro-
jection assumes that these arrangements will continue during
the project period.  The revenues are projected on the gross
basis assuming the following:
Automatic
(i) In 1979, about 42,000 (or 20%) of the total subscri-
bers estimated to have access to the service. The
percentage of access of subscribers to long distance
service is assumed at 20%, 25% and 30% in 1980, 81
and 82, respectively.
(ii) Average number of impulses per subscriber is assumed
to increase 10% per annum for 1980-82.
(iii) Average charge per impulse is the same as that for
local call service.
(iv) In 1979, the average annual revenue per subscriber
for long distance automatic service is estimated
at about Col$2,000.
(v) After the toll ticketing system is installed in
1983, total revenue is projected to increase by
35% in 1983 and 20% in 1984.
Manual: Average revenue per subscriber is assumed at
about Col$600 and remains constant during the project
period.
(f) International revenues are projected on a gross basis (i.e.,
before participation) assuming the following:
(i) In 1979, the number of subscribers who have used
this service is estimated at about 500 and this
number is expected to increase to about 1,000 in
1984.
(ii) The average revenue per subscriber in 1979 is esti-
mated at about Col$264,000 and is expected to
increase by about 30% in 1982, 20% in 1983 and 10%

ANNEX 19

in 1984 after TELECOM commissions the new satellite
station and a new international exchange in 1982.
No increase is expected during 1980-81 Ls the facili-
ties have been fully utilized and expansion is not
likely.
(g) Other operating revenues include 25% of the total revenues
from telephone directories (the remaining 75% is to the
publishing company, PUBLICAR) and are assumed to increase by
15% per year.
4.        Operating Expenses include the following items:
(a) Costs of operation are projected on the basis of EPM's esti-
mated telephone staff requirements and annual local price
inflation.
(b) Administration costs are projected on the basis of annual local
price inflation and Telephone Department's requirements during
the project period including allocated overhead expenses. Also
included in this item are severance and pension provisions.
(c) Depreciation is calculated using straight line method based
on major asset categories and averages about 6.0% of average
gross fixed assets in operation during the year. Also included
is the depreciation on the accumulated revaluation adjustment
on foreign borrowings for exchange variation as required by
Colombian law; the depreciation rate is at 3.72%.
(d) Municipal contribution as required by EPM's article of incor-
poration is computed at 3.42% of total telephone operating
revenues. EPM is otherwise tax exempt.
5.        Other income includes non-operating income such as interest
income, late payment penalty, etc.
Balance Sheet
6.        Fixed assets are based on EPM's telephone construction expendi-
tures program during 1980-84 and the completion of the major items in the
investment program. For the purpose of calculating the rate of return,
EPM's estimated telephone assets as of December 31, 1979 have been tenta-
tively revalued by 200% of existing book value and an annual revaluation
is applied to the gross fixed assets and the accumulated depreciation
each year to more accurately reflect the impact of price escalation and
exchange variation on the one hand and the effect of technology advancement
and economies of scale on reducing the prices of telecommunications equip-
ment on the other. To derive the annual revaluation factor, an average
index is first computed from the local inflation index and the foreign



- 50 -
ANNEX 19
Page 4 of 5 pages
inflation index adjusted to reflect the exchange rate variation; each of
the local and foreign inflation indices is weighted by their correspond-
ing foreign and local components of the program costs. The revaluation
factor is then assumed about half of the weighted average index (Annex 16,
Attachment 1).
7.        Work in progress is projected taking into account the estimated
construction schedule.
8.        Cash and banks are projected using EPM's estimated cash require-
ments based on its cash operating expenses including debt service and
local cost of capital expenditures.
9.        Subscribers accounts receivable position is expected to be main-
tained at two months of the billing.
10.       Inventories are expected to increase at approximately the same
rate of the gross fixed assets in operation.
11.       Other current assets included transitory investment only in
1978 and 1979. Other items included are prepayments, sundry accounts receiv-
able, etc., and are projected to increase by 15% per year.
12.       Other assets are assumed to increase by 10% per year.
13.       Equity is expected to increase through increase in retained
earnings. As of December 31, 1979, EPM's equity in its Telephone Branch
is estimated at Col$934.0 million which includes a capital of Col$23.5
million.
14.       Long term debts include the proposed Bank loan of US$44.0 million
at an annual interest rate of 8.25% plus 3/4 of 1% commitment charge, with a
17 years repayment period including 4 years grace. Also included are other
external borrowings to be arranged by EPM; the terms are assumed at an
annual interest rate of 11.0% and 8.5% for commercial loans and suppliers
credits respectively, plus a 1/2 of 1% commitment charge with a 10 year
repayment period including 2 years grace. Interest rate for local bor-
rowings are assumed at 15% per year with 2 to 5 years repayment period.
Interests during construction are capitalized.
15.       Current liabilities largely reflect accounts payable and sundry
accounts, and are estimated on the basis of EPM's projected working capital
requirements for its accounts payable for capital expenditures, operating
expenses and debt services.
16.       Subscriber deposits are projected on the basis of estimated new
subscribers and the average deposit per subscriber.
17.       Pension reserve is projected based on the actuarial study pre-
pared by EPM in 1975.

18.       Severence reserve is projected on the basis of EPM estimated
telephone staff number, the salary level and the service length of indi-
vidual staff.
19.       Other liabilities are assumed to increase by 15% per year.
