MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE LEBANESE REPUBLC
FOR AN EMERGENCY RECONSTRUCTION AND REHAITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the foRowing memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Lebanon for the equivalent of US$175 million to help finance an Emergency Reconstruction ad
Rehabilitation Project (ERRP), as part of a larger US$2.25 billion National Emergency Rewnstruction
Program (NERP). The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a matuity of 17
years, including 5 years of grace. Cofincing for the NERP is expected from at least eight donors.
2.    Badkground. Lebanon, a prosperous upper middle-income country iu the mid-1970s, has been
devastated by 17 years of turmoil resulting from violent civil strife and military occupation. Much of the
country's capital stock has been destroyed or is severely deteriorated; a quarter of the population has been
displaced and now lives in unhealthy shanty towns, in semi-destroyed buildings or in other people's
homes. Overcrowding is severe and housing quality is inadequate. Public and social services are either
unavailable or of poor quality; only about one third of electricity capacity is operational; water treatment
and sewage disposal are virtually nonexistent; and most schools and hospitals are damaged. The loss in
human resources has been considerable: hundreds of thousands have been killed or disabled, and a large
number of professionals and entrepreneurs have left the country, thus weakening instittions. By 1990,
real per capita income, at around $1,000, was only about one third of the 1975 level. Total damage has
been estimated by the United Nations at $25 billion, and the country has enormous reconstruction needs.
3.    Following the 1989 Ta'if Accord for National Reconciliation, sponsored by the Arab League, the
fis steps were taken towards restoring normal life. The Government revived the Council for
Development and Reconstruction (CDR) and entrusted it with the task of prepaig a recovery strategy;
government authority was gradually restored in the course of 1990 as fighting came to an end and the
militias were disbanded.
4.    During 1991, an improved security situation and some initi reconstruction activity conributed to
a significant recovery in output from the depressed levels of 1989190 when fighting had been particudarly
intense. Spurred by large inflows of private capital, in response to political and economic stabilization,
activity took off in virtally every sector of the Lebanese economy. Real GDP grew by over 40 percent
from the depressed 1990 level. Moreover, in 1991, the Government succeeded in reducing inflation from
84 percent the year before to about 30 percent at year's end, and in stabilizing the exchange rate.
However, the stabilization program was unsustnable in the absence of fiscal correction, particularly
since interest payments on Treasury bills that were issued to absorb the large speculative capital inflows
further increased the fiscal imbalance. As a consequence, the economic situation worsened in 1992, as
the fiscal deficit widened significantly after the Govermnent awarded a 200 percent retroactve increase in
public wages. This triggered a large outflow of capital and pressures on the Lebanese pound. The
Central Bank iniially attempted to defend the value of the currency, but, in the absence of fiscal
adjustment, this effort was futile and resulted in a loss of reserves of about US$0.5 billion. Subsequently,
the pound depreciated by more than 50 percent between February and May 1992, vwhich, because of the
openness of the economy, in turn resulted in an acceleration of inflation. This crisis, which particuy
affected the poores segment of the population, tiggered a naional strike and forced the Government to
resign in May 1992. The new Govenment installed in May failed to control the fiscal deficit; exchange
rate depreciation proceeded at a rapid pace, and inflation reached 155 percent for the first nine months of
1992. These developments also depressed GDP growth to an esfimated 10-15 percent in 1992.



-2 -
S.    Following Parliamentary elections in September 1992, a new Government took office on October
31, 1992. It now faces the challenging task of restoring economic stability, which is a precondition for
attracting private and official financing for the reconstruction program. Increased confidence inspired by
the new Government has led to significant short-term private capita! inflows, including conversions from
US dollar to Lebanese pound deposits, which has reversed the depreciation of the exchange rate and
enabled the Central Bank to replenish its reserves (to about US$1.5 billion by end-1992) and the
Government to switch from Central Bank to domestic debt financing of its deficit. As a result, inflation
is estimated to have come down to single-digit levels. The Government has announced that the
restoration of fiscal balance is one of its key objectives. This will require relatively drastic fiscal action
through a combination of measures that raise government revenues from the 1992 level of only 10 percent
of GDP-ii-;Ading customs duties, petroleum taxes and real estate taxes-and restrict current budget
expenditures. The latter would include a reduction in budget transfers through adjustments in electricity
tariffs and a containment of the wage bill by limiting wage increases and eliminating ghost workers from
the payroll. Over the past months the Government has already initiated a number of fiscal actions,
including administrative measures to improve income and real estate tax collection, the elimination of
wheat subsidies, the elimination of exemptions to customs duties, increases in telephone charges and
electricity connection fees and measures to improve electricity tariff collection.
6.    Stabilization measures are beng imrlemented, and It is expected that the current budget deficit
will be sharply reduced fom the estimated level of around 10 percent of GDP in 1992, and viraly
eliminated by 1994. Lebanon needs substantial amounts of external assistance in support of stabilization
and reconstruction. Despite the projected improvement in fiscal performance, extal loans and grans
will be required to finance the reconstruction of Lebanon's infrastructure. Extern  public debt was
estimated at about US$360 million (8 percent of GDP) at the end of 1991 and is low by any standard. In
spite of the difficult circumstances, Lebanon has met its debt service obligations with the Bank, and its
current outstanding obligations amount to only about US$20 million. While the level of public debt is
projected to quintuple to about US$1.8 billion over the next four years because of the external financing
required for the NERP, debt indicators would remain low. The external publhc debt to GDP ratio would
be around 2t percent, and the external public debt service to exports ratio would be less than 5 percent
by the mid-1990s, which would be manageable considering the country's projected improved fiscal
capacity to service debt.
7.    The medium-term projections suggest that the deficit in the current account of the balance of
payments, which curreny is around 50 percent of GDP, would initally remain high because of the
import needs associated with the reconstruction program but would gradually decline to about 20 percent
of GDP by the end of the decade. It is expected that a large share of the external financing needs of the
economic recovery will be met by private capital, as credibility in the Lebanese economy is being
restored. With political and economic stability, private flows are likely to be forthcoming in the
magnitude required.
8.    Country Reovery Stteg. Rebuilding the ravaged economy and returning to susainable
growth requires a phased program comprising: (i) a short-term emergency reconstruction phase (1993-
1996) for which the Government prepared the NERP; and (ii) a medium-term recovery phase (1996-
2000). While much of Lebanon's reconstruction and restoration of productivity can be expected to be
undertaken by the private sector, government support is crucial, particularly in the short-term
reconstruction phase. The short-term reconstruction would involve: (a) emergency repairs and
rehabilitation to remove infrastructure botdenecks and restore productivity; (b) the implementation of
economic stabilization measures that would facilitate the mobilization of donor support and the
repatration of the private capital needed to finance medium- and long-term investments; (c) the
alleviation of severe socia hardships and poverty; and (d) the rebuilding of the insutional capacity of
public agencies, with emphasis on economic infrastructure. Both reconstruction and recovery phases



require considerable external assistance. As a result of the reconstruction and recovery program,
Lebanon is expected to regain its ability to pursue progress primarily based, as in the past, on private
sector led development.
9.    Bank Response and Assistanee Strategy. Although the Bank has been inactive in Lebanon for
nearly a decade and a half, it responded promptly to Lebanon's request for assistance in jump starting the
economy. In July 1991, Bank staff participated in the first external mission to the country since 1988, the
United Nations Needs Assessment mission. In October 1991, the Bank fielded an economic data
gathering mission, which formed the basis for a Bank report that was circulated to the participante of a
Donor Coordination Meeting, chaired by the Banlr in December 1991. Subsequently, the Bank assisted
the Govermnent in the preparation of damage assessment studies for key infrastructure and for the NERP.
Bank eccnom:c missions visited Lebanon in 1992, and a draft Country Economic Memorandum has been
prepared and recendy discussed with the Government. The dialogue based on this report formed the basis
for a broad understanding between the Goverment and the Bank on macroeconomic policies for
stabilization and reconstruction. The report is now being finalized for distribution to the Board during the
current fiscal year.
10.   The Bank's strategy for the shortterm phase aims to assist Lebanon in rebuilding its ravaged
economy and in laying the ground for susinable growth. Tbis would comprise direct support for the
NERP in areas where the Bank has comparative advantage and could apply the lessons learned from 30
years of emergency assistance; in collaboration with the IM, the Bank is also helping to develop a
comprehensive, shortterm stabilization program. At the same time, the Bank would play a catalytic role
in mobilizing and coordinating aid for the reconstruction effort.
11.   In addition to large-scale financial support for reconstruction woris, Lebanon requires masive
technical assistance to compensate for the qualified and experienced public staff who left the country
durming the war. The Bank would work closely with the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) in establishing a tehnical assistance tust fund aimed at channeling and coordinating the
thnical assistance likely to be available from several multlateral and bilateral sources. Also, direct
support, with a technical assisunce component for the strengthening of economic management ard the
establishment of appropriate institutional and regulatory frameworks to permit private sector paWli4pation
in the provision of inascture services, is being proposed under the ER}W.
12. Beyond the three-year emergency operation, the Bank's lending program would focus on: (i)
addressing the significant needs in the social sectors, including the rehabilitation of basic infructure in
the education and health sectors, technical and vocational training and housing; and (Q) rehabilitating and
expanding capacity in key inructure sectors (water supply and transport), which would have high
returns as they would remove existng botdenecks to output growth. While rceedig with the proposed
ERRP, the Bank would assist the Government in inducing private sector investmt in the same sectors
and in strengthening institutions.
13.   Donor Coornation. In December 1991, at the Aid Coordination meetig chaired by the Bank,
the intational donor community manifested interest in supporti  the reconstruction of the Lebanese
ecowmy. Donors have already shown their readiness to cooperate and work with the Bank and one
another during the preparation of the NERP and the design and preappraisal of the ERRP. It is envisaged
that Aid Coordination or Consultative Group (CG) meedngs would be convened during each of the next
three fiscal years.
14.   Program Description. The Government NERP is a broad-baed multisectoral operation,
designed to remove infrstucture bottlenecks, reduce socia problems and lay the foundation for medium-

-4-
period, encompasses 15 sectors that can be grouped in 5 main areas of intervention: infrastructure, social
sector services, production activity, government building reconstruction, and technical assistance.
15.   Estimated Program Cost and Plnancing Plan. The total cost of the Government's NERP is
estimated at US$2.25 billion (including contingencies), with a foreign exchange component of US$1.91
billion or 85 percent. The public investment component of the NERP is estimated dt US$1.69 billion (75
percent). Externally financed housing secter credit is estimated at US$0.21 billion and technical
assistance (including project and non-project related) at US$0.30 billion. Present donor commitments and
promises indicate that the NERP would be supported by: (i) the proposed Bank loan of US$0.17 billion;
and (ii) identified financing of US$0.68 billion from donors. The financing gap of US$1.40 billion is
expected to be financed by the Government and by other donors to be identified at the CG meeting
planned for the second quarter of 1993. (See Financing Plan in Schedule A.) It is expected that
substantial support from the donors will be mobilized (see para. 13). In any event, an external financing
shortfall for the NERP as a wMole would not affect the implementation of the ERRP, except possibly the
housing component (see para. 57 of the Technical Annex).
16.   Project Objectives. The ERRP would assist the Government, within the fiamework of the
NERP, to: (i) rehabilitate, repair and reconstruct damaged physical and social infrastructure facilities and
housing; and (ii) strengthen the Government's institutional capabilities in implemenfing the NERP.
Because Lebanon needs time to attract private investors, to bring order to its public finances and to
eliminate unsustainable macroeconomic imbalances, the proposed ERRP is not in itself a vehicle for
policy reform. However, the ERRP has been designed to ensure that actions necessary for its successful
implementation will be compatible with future sectoral and macroeconomic reform programs.
17.   Project Description. The proposed loan would support the following components within the
NERP: (i) the reconstruction and rehabilitation of water and wastewater facilities; (d) the rehabilitation
of electricity distribution facilities; (ill) the purchase of equipment and the rehabilitation of trement
facilities for solid waste collection and disposal; (iv) the reconstuction and re-equipment of damaged
vocational and technical training facilities; (v) the reconstruction and repair of damaged houses and the
construction of new houses, giving priority to displaced households; and (vi) technical assistaw^e in
support of the economic management and the restructring of infrastructure services. In order tx;
maintain some flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances and priorities, including donor interests, the
ERRP is designed to permit a reallocation of funds within each sector and between sectors. Such
reallocations would be decided at the yearly reviews of implementation performance. (Further details are
provided in the Technical Annex.)
18.   Project Cost and Plnancing Plan. The total cost of the ERRP is estimad at US$223.9 million,
including physical contingencies (8 percent of base cost) and price contingencies (6 percent of base cost).
The Bank loan would finance US$175 million, covering 78 percent of the project costs; the private sector
would finance US$13.5 million (6 percent of total cost); and the Government would finance US$35.4
million (16 percent of total cost).
19.   Disbursement and Procurement. Amounts and methods of procurent and a disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. Retroactive financing of US$13.0 million has been included for
consultants services and advance payments for urgent equipment and civil works contracts. A timetable
of key project processing events and the sts of Bank Group operations in Lebanon are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. Photographs and a map are also attached.
20.   Project Implementation. The Bank's ERRP would be implemented over a three-year period by
existng sector ministries and the CDR. The CDR would be strengthened to perform the program
management fimction, while Sector Implementation Units (SlUs) would be created within each sector



-  -
ministry concerned to reinforce the ministry's capacity for implementation. A Program Management Unit
(PMU) has been created in the CDR. The staffing of Wue PMU and SIUs would complement and
reinforce existing capabilities and would include existing government specialists assisted by foreign and
local consultants. The European Community (EC) would finance, on a grant basis, most of the costs of
the consultant contracts supp ,rting the PMU and SIU. A yearly review of the ERRP would be carrie4
out by Bank staff and goverment officials to assess progress and resolve implementation problems.
21.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. Social awd economic stability is a prerequisite for econ- .nic
recovery in Lebanon. As Lebanon needs immediate assistance to restore stability, the Bank's help is
vital. The proposed loan would provide part of the financial resources required to remove the
infatstructure bottlenecks; it would also play a critical role in reestablishing the confidence of private
investors and in attracting the commitment of other official donors who have made it clear that they
regard the Bank's leadership as vital to their own decision to provide support to the NERP. The
proposed loan is consistent with Bank strategy for the country (see para. 10). In particular, the proposed
project would help rebuild consumers' confidence in the reliability of infrastructure and would encourage
them to pay for the services they receive. The increased revenues would, in turn, help alleviate the
govermnent fiscal deficit by reducing direct subsidies. In this context, the project is consistent wih the
macroeconomic stabilization objectives of the Government.
22.   Actions Agreed. The Government has taken initial actions to ensure effective program and
project implementation. With the assistance of Bank staff, the overall responsibilities of sectoral
ministries and of the CDR have been clearly defined and agreed to by the officials .oncerned. The PMU
has been set up, and arrangements for the recruitment of consultants for the SlUs are underway and
would be completed by the beginning of project implementation. Moreover, the Government is fully
committed to institutional reform in the infrastructure sectors. Policy statements (for improving cost
recovery and the efficiency of the management of infrastructure services) are being prepared with the
assistance of Bank staff and will be finalized by December 31, 1993. Also, the Government provided
assurances that it would allocate budget resources for the recurrent costs that cannot be covered through
internal cash generation and that operation and maintenance services would be contracted to private sector
fims wherever a public agency is incapable of adequately performing these tasks. The Government
would also obtain furds from other donors at concessional terms, to lower the average cost of funds for
the housing component.
23.   Environmental Aspects. The deteriorated conditions in Lebanon due to war damages cause a
severe risk to public health and the environment. The main hazards are: the polluted water distibution
system; scattered solid waste dumping all over the country; and heavy air pollution due to the extensive
use of individual diesel-powered generators (needed to offset the loss of publicly generated and distributed
electricity), heavy traffic, open solid waste burning and the bad quality of fuel. The ERRP, by providing
assistance to the sectors most concerned - water, wastewater, solid waste and electricity - would midgate
the hazards to the environment and public health. However, being an emergency operation, the ERRP
would only remedy the most urgent problems. Subsequent measures, to be formulated during NERP
implementation, would be addressed under a separate Bank assistance program to be funded by the
Mediterranean Environmental Technical Assistance Program (METAP) and the Global Environmental
Facility (GEF). The project is classified as Category B.
24.   Benefits. The proposed Bank ERRP would have economic and social benefits. Economic
benefits would comprise (i) the restoration of infrastructure services that are critical to the resumption of
production; and (ii) the rebuilding of consumers' and investors' confidence, which is essential for
generating revenues from user charges and auracting private funding for infrastructre investments,
thereby, alleviating the Government's fiscal deficit. Social benefits would inelude: (i) improvements in
public health, through the reduction of domestic water contamination and the removal of sewage from the



-6 -
streets; (ii) the mitigation of some of the effects of social dislocation, through the rehabilitation of
damaged and destroyed housing units and educational facilities; and (iii) a reduction in social hardship,
through the generation of work opportunities in the construction industry.
25.   Risks. The main risks to the proposed Bank project would be the security situation and
implementtion constraints. Some parts of the counrAy, particularly those along the southern borders with
Israel, continue to experience incidents that would make them unsafe for the implemenation of works
financed under the project. Bank supervision missions would monitor the siuation, and, if necessary,
adjusmens would be made in the allocation od finds for specific subprojects. In order to reduce the
implementation risk, the project, as part of the NERP, proides for technical assistance to improve
implementation capacity. The main risks to :he overall reconstruction program and recovery strategy
would be the failure by the Government to establish and maintain a viable macroeconorilc framework and
ensure political stability. In the absence of macroeconomic and political stability, the program could not
be fully financed and implemented, and the private resources required for associated investments in the
economy would not be forthcoming. Also, the fiscal capacity to service the debt to be contracted for the
program could be in doubt. However, the Government has indicated that establishing and maintining
adequate macroeconomic balance is one of its key objectives. At the same time, the aspirations of a
people recovering from nearly two decades of conflict, as well as evolving regional iniatives, make it
more likely than ever that political stakiity can be maintained in Lebanon.
26.   R mndafo   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

1. BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY
1.    Prior to the eruption of civil war, Lebanon was enjoying a high rate of economic growth.
Between 1964 and 1973, the growth in GDP averaged 6.2 percent per annum in real terms. The
national budget was balanced, the balance of payments generated surpluses and the national currency
was strong. The service sectors, namely trade, tourism and fmance, were the driving force of the
free-market system, which attracted business from surrounding oil-based economies. However, in the
absence of a well-defined govermment strategy in the social sector, economic success was threatened
by growing disparities in income and wealth.
2.    In 1975, civil war erupted, and the country went through different waves of violence, civil
strife and military occupation. After 1975, the economy deteriorated markedly, with intermittent
recovery during the two periods of relative calm, 1978 to 1981 and 1986 to 1988. The destruction
affected all sectors: housing, social and physical infrastructure, offices and factories. Despite such
prolonged periods of destruction, the people and the economy showed surprising resilience,
reactivating output when circumstances permitted. In fact, a large proportion of industry remained
unscathed until the conflicts of 1989 and 1990.
3.    In September 1989, the Arab League, with the support of the international community,
proposed a ceasefire and called for the adoption of a National Accord Charter. The Lebanese
National Assembly subsequently convened in Ta'if, Saudi Arabia, and endorsed the Ta'if Accord in
October 1989. The Ta'if Accord provides a framework for a return to normalcy and political stability
through national reconciliation and a negotiated settlement of the crisis, including political reform.
4.    From September 1989 to October 1990, the country (and particularly the eastern part)
experienced an outbreak of further violence caused by the rejection of the Ta'if Accord by the
Transitional Authority led by General Aoun. The violence was ended with Syrian assistance, and a
National Reconciliation Government was formed. The city of Beirut was reunified after the departure
of the militias, which was dissolved by the Government in March 1991. The national army was
reunified, and government authority was reestablished over the Greater Beirut area and most of the
national territory. In September 1992, new parliamentary elections were held, and on October 31 a
new Government was formed.
5.    Overall Economic and Social Impact. The civil war had a severe impact on the socio-
economic conditions in the country, reflected by the impoverishment of the population and the almost
complete disappearance of the middle class. The monthly minimum wage, which stood at US$135 in
1975, decreased to US$50 in October 1992. Real per capita GNP (currently about US$1000) has
fallen to about one third of the 1975 level, and income inequalities have increased substantially.
While in 1973 the level of per capita income was 42 percent above the average of all middle-income
countries, by 1988 it had fallen to 65 percent below the average.
6.    The impact of the civil war on social conditions was equally grave. Nearly one quarter of the
population has been displaced and now lives in unhealthy shanty towns, in semi-destroyed buildings
and in other people's homes. Overcrowding and inadequate housing for the displaced are major
problems. About 55 percent of displaced households suffer from severe overcrowding; 21 percent do
not ha'e private water supply connections (compared to 8 percent prior to displacement); and 48
percent are housed under unstable conditions - that is in dwellings constructed on ilegally occupied
land or in illegally occupied buildings (compared to 6 percent prior to displacement).



- 17 -
7.    Damage Assessment. The total damage to physical assets sustained by the Lebanese during
the past 17 years was estimated by the United Nations at US$25 billion;11 all sectors have been
affected: housing, social infrastructure and services, and commercial and industrial businesses. The
loss in human resources has been considerable. Apart from the loss of life and the disabling of
hundreds of thousands of people, about 200,000 professional and skilled Lebanese have sought
employment in the neighboring Arab oil-producing countries, in Europe and in the USA. Amongst
the resident population, unemployment is estimated at 35 percent of ti . labor force.
8.    The damage assessments carried out by the Government in the first quarter of 1992 clearly
illustrate the devastation that has occurred in the country. Some of this is due to direct war damage,
while some is due to the accumulated effects of a total disruption of normal life. Capital investment
to replace or extend systems has virtually ceased, and maintenance has been inadequate due to the
lack of funds, personnel and spare parts and equipment.
0     Only about 50 percent of telephone connections are in service; and there is only
about a 10 percent chance of completing a call successfully.
*     The electricity system has an installed generating capacity of about 1600 MW, but
only about 500 to 600 MW is actually in service. Supplies are rationed to about 6
hours per day.
*     All water treatment plants have been damaged and are operated at reduced capacity.
Only 10 percent of chlorinators, essential for the disinfection of the water and for
public safety, are sti funcional.
a     'Tere are no functioning sewage treament facilities in the country.
a     In 1990, 80 percent of water samples collected from springs, wells, reservoirs and
water distribution networks were polluted.
a     Solid waste collection equipment and vehicles have been almost entirely destroyed,
and refuse is piled up along streets, vacant lots and the sea coast.
n     Most schools, hospitals and vocational and technical training colleges are severely
damaged.
a     Nearly one quarter of the housing stock is either damaged or destroyed.
9.    Besides depriving the country of the infrastructure services essental for normal life and
economic activity, this total deterioration of public services has had two other undesirable effects:
*     Unregulated private provision of alternaive forms of service (such as self-contained
telecommunications systems or diesel generators), which are affordable only to the
rich, interfere with the restoration of electricity service and (in the case of generators)
pollute the environment.

Report, August 20, 1991 (page 19).



- 18-
a     People are unwilling to pay for public services, at least until they are substantially
improved (while increased revenues are essential to rehabilitate the systems).
10.   The deterioration in the public sector institutions is not evident in the damage assessments.
For example, the telecommunications section of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPTI)
has a vacancy rate of 66 percent; even with the use of daily-paid and contract staff there is a 30
percent shortfall. Similarly, at the Ministry of Hydraulic and Electric Resources (MHER) water
management staff is, at present, at only 30 percent of its authorized strength. The loss of experienced
and qualified staff to posts overseas, and the need for existing staff to hold at least two jobs in order
to survive, resulte :n mstitutional weaknesses that cannot be remedied without substantial reforms.
11.   It is not only the technical institutions that have suffered this deterioration. Almost as
important, from the perspective of the overall restoration of normal life, is the damage done to
supportng institutions such as those concerned with financing house purchases and construction.
With approximately one quarter of the 1988 housing stock demolished or severely damaged, people
have no access to affordable long-term loans for house reconstruction and repairs.
12.   Government Response and Strategy. Following the 1989 Ta'if Accord for National
Reconciliation, the first steps were taken towards restoring normn life. The Government revived the
Council for Development and Reconstruction (-DR) and entrusted it with the task of preparing a
national reconstruction strategy and implementig a Five-Year Reconstruction Plan (RP) and a
National Emergency Reconstruction Program (NERP). The strategy for rebuilding the ravaged
economy and addressing the socia problems will be implemented in a phased program comprising:
(a) short-term emergency reconstruction and rehabilitation; (b) medium-term recovery; and (c) long-
term development. It is expected that much of Lebanon's reconstruction wil be undertaken by the
private sector, with government support in the first phase.
13. The recovery strategy prepared in December 1991, envisaged a total investment of US$4.5
biUlion over a five-year period, representing 18 percent of the total damage of US$25 billion estimated
by the United Nations. Subsequently, the CDR prepared, with Bank assistance, a NERP amounti
to US$2.25 biUlion over a period of three and one-half years. The NERP comprises US$1.69 billion
in public investments, US$0.25 biBlion for credit to the private sector and US$0.30 biUlion for
technical assistance (including project and non-project related). Urgent rehabilitation work for some
schools has already started with EC and Saudi Arabian funding. The Government has also secured
financing from the EC for institutional strengthening services. The new Government, formed on
October 31, 1992, is expected to reach agreement with the Bank and IMF on an economic
stabilization program. When the first steps in the implementation of this program are taken, the Bank
will call for a Consultative Group meeting.
14.   Mobilization of External Assistance and Coordination Meaisms. Due to the security
situation prior to May 1991, only humanitarian assistance was provided by most UN agencies, as well
as Arab, European and US governments and NGOs (ocal and foreign). After May 1991, regional
and international donors initiated efforts to provide financial and technical assistance. The
Government assigned the aid coordination task to the CDR and requested the Bank's assistance in
mobilizing foreign aid. At the Aid Coordination meeting in December 1991, chaired by the Bank,
the international donor community showed increasing interest and a willngness to support the
reconstruction of the Lebanese economy. Externa funds secured up to October 31, 1992, in support
of the Government's NERP reached US$151 million in loans and US$22 millon in grants.
Additional promises and protocols amount to US$760 million in loans (icluding the proposed
US$175 million ERRP) and US$62.4 million in grants.

15.   CrosSectoral Needs and Sectoral Priorities. Considering the extent of damage inflicted on
the economic, physical and social sectors, the Government established priorities for investments in the
first three years of the program on the following basis: for physical infrastructure, priority would be
given to removing the botflenecks that are constraining the resumption of economic activity by ohe
private sector; for the social sector, priority would be given to housing repair and reconstruction, to
permit the return of displaced households to their villages and houses. Education is a second priority
of the social sector with particular emphasis given to primary education and vocational training,
whkh is important for the integration into society of the unemployed labor force-including the
former militia elements-and for the reconstruction phase. Moreover, the cross-sectoral priority of
reducing public health hazards and pollution has also been established and entails immediate action in
the water, wastewater, solid waste and health care sectors.
16.   Bank Response and Strategy. In response to the Government's request, the Bank provided
assistance in the preparation of NERP and promised financial assistance for its support. The Bank
also organized and chaired an Aid Coordination meeting in December 1991. The Bank is preparing a
Country Economic Memorandum, and, in conjunction with the IMF, is assisting the Government in
the design and implementation of a 'nacroeconomic stabilization program. Additional assistance in
mobilizing donor financial support would be furnished by the Bank, provided the Government agrees
to and starts to implement a viable stabilization program acceptable to the Bank and the IMP.
Subsequent Bank support would likely be in the social sectors (housing and education) and in selected
infastructure sectors (water, wastewater and electricity).
H. DErA MLED PROJECT DESCRIION
17.   The National Emergency Reconstruction Program. The NERP is designed as a multi-
sectoral operation focussed on emergency repairs and the rehabilitation of physical and social
ifastrucure. It aims to undertake, within a ftfee and one-half year time span, a series of integrated
measures designed to have maximum impact on restoring economic activity and alleviatng socia
hardship. The NERP encompasses 15 sectors grouped in 5 components: infastructure, the social
sector, production, government buildings, and technical assistance.
18.   The infrastructure component supports the rehabilitation and reconstruction of facilides in the
following sectors: water and wastewater, solid waste, electricity, telecomnmnications, roads, ports
sad the airport. Ihe social sector component supports the reconstruction and re-equipment of
damaged facilities in education, health, social services and housing. The production component
provides credit facilities to private sector activities Cm agriculture) and finances the rehabilitation of
public facilites in oil and gas. Technical assistance supports public sector capacity-building in
various aspects of economic management and in the implementation of the NERP. The government
buildings component supports the rehabilitation and re-equipment of key ministries and revemu-
earning facilities. A summary description of the program components r_ financed under the
proposed Bank project is provided in the remaining sections of this chapter. A detailed descripon of
each program component is provided in the project file.
19.   The Bank's Eingeny Reconstuction and Rehabilitation Project. The proposed ERRP
supports the overall objectives of the Government's NERP. It aims to restore a basic level of
functioning to infrastructure services, rebuild consumer confidence and create an environment in
which essential institutional and financial reform is feasible. To ensure a reasonable impact on the
NERP, the proposed ERRP is limited to five physical sectors: (i) water and wastewater (34 percent);



- 20 -
(ii) electricity (20 percent); (iii) solid waste (17 percent of the loan); (iv) education (9 percent); (v)
housing finance (14 percent); and (vi) technical assistance (6 percent). The allocation of ERRP funds
for these sectors takes into consideration their impact on economic and soc.al conditions, their
readiness for implementation, existing and expected cofinancing commitments and institutional
arrangements for implementation and cost recovery.
20.   The sectoral allocations of the ERRP listed in Table 1 are explained in the remaining sections
of this report. In order to be able to adapt to changing circumstances and priorities, the ERRP is
designed to permit a reallocation of funds within each sector and between sectors. Such reallocations
would be decided at formal yearly reviews of implementation performance, to be carried out by
World Bank staff and the Government.
WATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWATER
21.   Background. In 1982, virtually all dwellings in urban areas and 85 percent of the rural
communities had clean, piped water supplied from public systems. The situation is different today:
the water quality is unsatisfactory and causes widespread health hazards; all 18 existing water
treatment plants have been damaged and are operated at reduced capacity, and only 10 percen of the
chlorinators are functioning; and operation and maintenance suffer from inadequate organizational
structures and a lack of skldled staff. The conditions of existing sewerage facilities are even worse
than those for water supply. Wastewater from coastal communities is discharged direcy along the
shores and from inland communities into rivers and streams used for domestic water supplies by
downstream communities.
22.   The National Emergency Reconstruction Progrm. The overall objective of the NERP for
water supply and wastewater is to reduce the detrimental health effects from the damaged water and
wastewater systems and improve the level of service (to equal the pre-war standard). The NERP
includes the following major components: (a) the execution of physical works, including equipment
supply and installation and related engineering and construction supervision; (b) the preparation of a
policy strategy paper for institutional and organizational development and of sudies and action
programs for subsequent implementation; and (c) the preparation of national development programs
for water supply and wastewater and feasibility studies for investments that would take place in a
subsequent phase. The above approach would provide for initial investments to be undertaken in
emergency rehabilitation and reconstructon work along with the establishment of a foundation for
medium- and long-term sector development. Based on the damage assessments for water supply and
wastewater, the investment requirements for rehabilitaion (mcluding relevant technical assistance  d
consultant services) have been estimated at US$298.3 million (including physical and price
contingencies), comprising about US$187.3 million for water supply and US$111 million for
wastewater. The direct and indirect foreign exchange requirements have been assessed at about 83
percent of total costs. Besides the Bank, the following agencies have expressed itaerest in the
finacing of the water supply and wastewater component of the NERP: the Kuwait Fund, the Arab
Fund, the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Community (EC) (already financing
engineering services and project management) and UNDP (for technical assistance). It is envisaged
that external financing can be secured for a total US$250 million investment requiements. To ensure
an integrated approach, the various contributions would be coordinated by the PMU and the SIUs.
23.   The Bank Emergency Reconstuction and Rehabilitation Project The overall objective of
the Bank's ERRP is to reduce public health hazards through the protection of the supply sources and
the reduction of water pollution caused by disfunctions of the sewerage system. The 2RRP would
cover country-wide rehabilitation works for the protection of water sources, water treatment and



- 21 -
disinfection, pumping and transmission and sewerage systems. The proposed ERRP loan for water
and wastewater would amount to US$60 million, with US$44 million for water supply and US$16
million for wastewater. The Bank loan would cover 100 percent of consultancy services and 85
percent of total costs for physical works, which would correspond to about 23 percent of estimated
investment requirements. For water supply, this would cover equipment and material (62.3 percent
of the total allocation), civil works (6.3 percent) and consultancv services (4.3 percent). For
wastewater, corresponding percentages would amount to 22 percent, 3.3 percent, and 1.8 percent.
(Table 2 provides a summary of costs for water and wastewater components to be financed with the
Bank loan). Physical works included in the ERRP have been selected to satisfy the following
priorities: the protection of surface and groundwater from actual and potential sources of pollutioni;
the provision of adequate treatment and disinfection facilities to ensure water supplies of satisfaory
quality; the rehabilitation (and, whe::e justified, extension) of distribution systems to enable ready
access to public water supplies; and the rehabilitation of sewerage networks to ensure satisfactory
sanitary conditions in built-up areas and the rehabilitation or extension of sewage treatment facilities
where urgenty required for environmental reasons.
24. Consultancy Services and Technical Assistance. Technical assistance and consultancy
sefvices to be financed under the proposed ERRP for water supply and wastewaer cover the
preparation of engineering designs, including tender documents, and consttion supervision for
works to be implemented under the ERRP.
25.   Impementation.  Water supply and wastewater would be combined Into one SIU, to be
located in the Ministry of Hydraulic and Electric Resources (MHER). lhe MHER would play a
major role in the implementation of the water supply and wastewater components of the NERP and,
potentially, in the consolidation of the many water boards and other agencies that are, at present,
involved in the water and wastewater sectors. It was agreed that procurement under the project would
be done through the CDR to take advantage of its more expeditious procurement procedures. The
respective involvement of the CDR and SW in the procurement process has been discussed in detail
and agreed to by the Government. (see para. 71 and Note 1 of this Annex).
26.   Timetable for Implementation. Tender documents for works (mcluding the supply and
installation of equipment and material) to be undertaken during the first year of the NERP are
scheduled to be completed by February 1993 when tender invitations would also be issued. The
award of contracts would then be made by April/May, with construction works starting by mid-1993.
For works to be covered in the subsequent two years, annual investment programs with related
engineering design and tender documents would be prepared for review at least six months before the
construction works were scheduled to commence. Figure 1 shows the proposed timetable in bar-chart
form.
27. Operation and Maintenance. In order to ensure immediate improvements in operation and
maintence, the following actions have been agreed for incorporation in the tender documents: (a)
contracts to be awarded for the rehabilitation and declogging of water distribution and sewerage
systems would also be used for any upcoming emergency works (blockages, pipe bursts) that could
not be handled by present organizations; and (b) suppliers of mechanical and electrical equipment
would provide operational support for a year after commissioning and for staff training (the suppliers
would subsequently be contracted for the provision of regular maintenance services and for keeping a
stock of spare parts; if needed, this service would be extended to include full responsibility for both
operation and mainteance). In order to improve billing and collection, the private sector would be
involved, as appropriate.



- 22 -
28.   Because of its fragmented sector structure, it has not been possible to review the ff Ancial and
budgetary situation for wastewater. For water supply, based on a review of the budgets for seven
water boards, the following was concluded: no provisions are made for debt service and/or for
replacements of non-operable facilities; no payments are made for electricity costs; fumds spent on
operation and maintenance are inadequate and would at least have to be dorbled, taking into account
the dilapidated conditions of the assets; the rate of billing varies but is generally low-only about 22
percent of those connected in south Beirut are actually billed. Until the sector organizations have
reached the stage of financial sustainability, the Government would continue to cover the recurrent
costs.
SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
29.   Background. Solid waste management services were severely affected by the civil war in
Lebanon. In all parts of the country, refuse collection equipment was either damaged through acts of
war or deteriorated as the result of ageing and the lack of maintenance. This has resulted in the
inability of authorities to collect the refuse generated by the urban populations; refuse is allowed to
pile up in unseemly heaps along major roads or is dumped along the sea coast, leading to
environmental degradation. Refuse collection and disposal is the responsibility of municipal
authorities. However, the resource base of the municipalities has been eroded because of the civil
war, and so municipalities depend on the central government for assistance both to cover the cost of
services and to pay the salaries of their staff. They are unable to restore a reasonable level of service
without help.
30.   The National Emergency Reconstruction Program. The solid waste management component
of the NERP is estimated to cost US$81.2 million (including contingencies and land acquisition), of
which US$57.5 million equivalent is in foreign exchange. This NERP estimate includes the cost of
(i) the acquisition of refuse containers and collection trucks for the whole country; (ii) the acquisition
of land and the development of disposal sites and maintenance workshops to serve the whole country;
(iii) the rehabilitation and utilization of the compost plant at Karantina and the recently completed
incineration plant at Amrousiyeh; and (iv) technical assistance for engineering services and
institutional development.
31.   The Bank Emergency Reconstruction Project (ERRP). The objectives of the ERRP are to
(i) prevent further environmental degradation resulting from the dumping of solid waste and to clea
up the environment; (ii) replace the collection equipment that has been damaged or reached the limit
of its useful life; (iii) create and operate suitable disposal sites; and (iv) strengthen the itions that
are responsible for waste collection and disposal, as well as for the maintenance of equipment. The
project would assist the Government in developing the institutional structures that would lead to the
improvement of service in the sector, better cost recovery and a more active role for the private
sector.
32.   The project would finance only the most essential parts of the NERP. The US$30 million
allocation would finance foreign exchange expenditures only. The cost of land acquisition for the
disposal sites, estimated at US$11 million, would be borne by the Government. The project would
include (i) the repair of part of the existing fleet of compactor trucks in Greater Beirut (where this is
viable); (ii) the procurement of 80 compactor/collector trucks and 2,760 containers, for country-wide
distribution; (iii) the development of the priority areas for landfill, in order to prevent further
dumping along the sea coast; (iv) the rehabilitation of the existing compost plant in the Karantina area
of Beirut; (v) the construction of a road to the Amrousiyeh incinerator and the first year's operation



- 23 -
and maintenance of the Amrousiyeh incinerator and the Kasant  Compost Plant; and (vi) technical
assistance for engineering services for design and construction supervision. The preparation of a long
term strategy for solid waste management is being financed under the Technical Assistance component
of the ERRP (see para 65).
33.   In the development of disposal sites, priority would be given to the Cazas of (i) Koura,
Tripoli, Batroun, Chouf, Jbeil, Kesrouane, luSetn, Saida, Tyre and Beirut to prevent further dumping
along the coast; (ii) Zahle, to protect its abundant water resources; and (iii) Baalbeck, to protect its
rich cultural heritage. lable 3 provides a summary of costs for the solid waste component to be
financed under the Bank loan.
34.   Timetable for Implementation. Although the creation of sanitary landfills should be given
top priority, their development cannot take place until land acquisition is completed. Therefore, the
timetable has been designed to allow for completing the expropriation procedures which have been
started. Figure 2 shows the proposed timetable in bar-chart form.
35.   Arrasgements for Project Implementation. Responsibility for solid waste management lies
with the municipalities, or the MinLtry of Environment. A Sector Implementation Unit (SIU) would
be placed within the Ministry of Environment to carry out the implementation of the project, in
coordination with the various municipal authorities and the various divisions of the CDR. It was
agreed that procurement under the project would be done through the CDR to take advantage of its
more expeditious procurement procedures. The respective involvement of the CDR and SIU in the
procurement process has been discussed in detail and agreed to by the Govermnent. (see para. 71 and
Note 1 of this Annex).
36.   Under the solid waste management component of the ERRP, technical assistance would be
required (i) for the design of landfill sites and the preparation of tender documents; and (ii) the
supervision of construction or implementation. The management of project implementation would be
carried out by the SIU for solid waste. For the implementation of the ERRP only, a team composed
of a senior mechanical engineer/team leader, a civil engineer for the landfills and workshops, a
second civil engineer to handle the rehabilitation of the compost plant and support staff would be
sufficient. If financing is assured for the remaining parts of the NERP, a second mechanical engineer
and one more civil engineer would be required.
37.   Operation and Maintenance. The project would fnance about one third of the country's
needs in collection equipment. As this represents only the replacement of damaged or aged
equipment, the drivers, mechanics, technicians and laborers needed for operation and maintenance are
already available at the municipal level. Furthermore, the amended rental law (which is the basis for
the calculation of the municipal tax) and the increased overall economic activity would gradually
increase the resources of municipalities. However, municipal authorities would need support in the
immediate future to cover their recurrent expenditures in consumable spare parts and fuel. It has
been agreed that (i) the ERRP would finance the first year's O&M costs for the Amrousiyeh
incinerator and the Karantina Compost Plant; and (ii) all other expenditures would be recovered
through direct charges to the beneficiaries.

ELECTRICrrY
38.   Background. Power sector activities in Lebanon are vertically integrated under the
responsibility of the stateowned Electricit6 du Liban (EdL), except for: (i) the statowned Office
National du Litani (ONL) in charge of the Litani hydro scheme (191 MW); (ii) a few private
generators, which operate small hydroelectric plants and sell bulk electricity to EdL; and (fii) two
small distribution concessions at Jbeil and Zable. The installed capacity of the system is about 1,600
MW, of which 268 MW is from hydro stations and 1,212 MW is from three thermal stations: Zouk,
Jieh and Hraiche. The electricity system is interconnected at 150 kV and 66 kV and includes 58 HV
substations with an installed transformer capacity of 1,620 MVA. Distribution is carried out at 35
kV, 15 kV, 11 kV and 5.5 kV, with an installed transformer capacity of about 1,600 MVA.
However, the 15 years of war have caused widespread damage to the power facilities through
destruction and the lack of maintenance. Many of the generating facilities are obsolete or in need of
major repairs. Currently, only 500 to 600 MW are available, and electricity supply is restricted to
about 6 hours per day. The transmission facilities suffered heavy damage during the war, and, at
present, the system cannot be interconnected; the various power plants are only able to supply
'pockets' of consumption. The distribution network has suffered heavily from the effects of the
war, and the entire distribution grids of displaced villages have been destroyed.
39.   The National Emergency Reconstruction Program. The investment needed for
reconstructing the power sector is significant and would amount to over US$800 million, including
US$300 million for new generating capacity and the adequate expansion of transmission and
distribution facilities. However, in view of limited financial resources and implementation capacity,
NERP of about US$295 million has been prepared to cover the most urgent rehabilitation works for
generation, transmission and distribution facilities. Works to be included in the NERP were selected
to restore pre-war nominal capacity through repair and retrofitting, but not to provide new capaciq.
Priorities and criteria for thr selection of work components have been established and include:
restoring communication links with the dispatching center; increasing the capacity and availability of
the existing generating stations; reconstructing the damaged transmission and distribution facilities;
restoring public safety; and protecting the existing equipment from further damage. On completion of
these works, it is estimated that service would improve significantly. However, the restored thermal
generation capacity of about 1,150 MW would not be sufficient to meet the expected load with an
adequate margin, and rationing may be needed at peak load.
40.   The Bank Emergency Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Project. The objectives of the
Bank-financed ERRP are: (i) to reconstruct and rehabilitate part of the war-amaged distributing
facilities in the Greater Beirut area and to remove any deficiencies in existing facilities to enable their
optimal use; and (ii) to reconstruct the distribution networks for destroyed villages to allow the return
of the displaced population. The project would also assist the Government in the preparation of an
appropriate regulatory framework which would attract private sector investments in the power sector
(see para. 65).
41.   While the financing of the electricity sector component of the NERP is provided in part by the
Kuwait Fund and the Arab Fund (US$110 million), Italy (US$39.6 million) and France (US$9.8
million), there is still a financing gap of about US$135.6 million, excluding the Bank ERRP loan.
The European Investment Bank is considering financing part of the program in distribution. The
proposed ERRP would provide about US$35 million to finance the foreign exchange cost of: (a) the
most urgent rehabilitation works in part of the MV and LV network in the Greater Beirut area; (b) the
MV and LV distribution networks and customer connections to restore the electricity supply in
destroyed villages all over the country; (c) metering equipment; and (d) engineering and construction
supervision for the above components. This would result in an improvement in the electricity supply



- 25 -
in the Greater Beirut area and would allow the return of displaced people to their villages throughout
the country. The proposed Bank loan would finance 85 percent of the total cost of the electricity
component. Table 4 provides a summary of costs for the electricity component of the ERRP.
42.   TImetable for Implementation. To expedite the rehabilitation works in the power sector, an
accelerated schedule has been decided by the Government, including the award of all the works of the
electricity component of the NERP to a limited number of contractors. The prequalification of
contractors for three packages (generation, transmission, distribution) was initiated on December 3,
1992, using World Bank sample documents for prequalification. Bidding documents have been
issued. Contracts are expected to be awarded in May 1993 for the generation and transmission
packages and in June 1993 for the distribution packages. As for the ERRP, tender documents for the
Greater Beirut component are being prepared on a supply-and-erect basis to be issued by February 15,
1993 to prequalified bidders. For the displaced villages, the necessary detailed design studies need to
be carried out in coordination with other infrastructure works to be implemented during the first year.
Figure 3 shows the proposed timetable in bar-chart form.
43.   Arrangements for Project Implementation. Responsibility for project implementation lies
with the Sector Implementation Unit (SIU) for the overall NERP to be set up within the Ministry of
Hydraulic and Electric Resources (reporting to the Minister). The SIU would include consultants,
MIER and EdL staff. It was agreed, however, that procurement under the project would be done
through the CDR to take advantage of its more expeditious procurement procedures. The respective
involvement of the CDR and SIU in the procurement process has been discussed in detail and agreed
to by the Government (see para. 71 and Note 1 of this Annex).
44.   Operation and Maintenance. The operation and maintenance performance of EdL is closely
related to its financial health and its ability to recruit and retain skilled staff. While the EdL financW
situation cannot be accurately assessed, since the latest financl statements available are those of
1987, it appears that EdL is kept operating only through heavy government subsidies: EdL expenses
for 1992 are estimated to be US$170 million (of which US$110 million is for fuel), compared to
projected collections of US$31 million. This is due to both inadequate tariffs and poor billing and
collection performance. While in the 1970s, tariffs provided sufficient revenue for EdL, the recent
devaluation of the Lebanese pound (LL 2.25 to the US$ in 1975, compared to an average of LL
2,000 in 1992) caused significant increases in EdL operating costs: over this period the cost in LL of
fuel oil for generation, all of which is imported, increased by a factor of 1,300. Salaries, although
not mntaning their real value, increased 300- to 350-fold between 1982 and 1992. Tariffs have not
kept pace with these increases; for example, in 1989 the domestic price of fuel oil was about
$0.005/kWh, compared to an economic cost of about $0.08 to $0.10. Although tariffs were increased
20- to 30-fold in January 1991, they are still not high enough to cover EdL costs. This shortfal is
also partly caused by an inability to collect the revenues due to EdL. Because of widespread theft,
illegal connections and poor billing and collections, it is estimated that EdL actually receives revenues
for less than 50 per cent of the amount billed.
45.   Since the new Government took office in November 1992, significant positive steps have been
taken to improve the efficiency of EdL. The Government started to enforce collection measures and
disconnect illegal consumers, and when the service is improved in 1993, tariffs will be increased.
The present tariff of LL 55IkWh for all consumers will be raised to about LL 100/kWh for
consumers with a monthly consumption of less than 200 kWh and to about LL 200/kWh for other
consumers. Also, the Government will secure technical assistance to help EdL in critical areas of
finance, management and operation. Further, the rehabilitadon works of the NERP would be
contracted in three or four major packages, which would include assistance for the operation of the
rehabilitated assets.

HOUSING
46.   Badcground. The 17 years of hostilities exacerbated the condition of the housing sector with
serious consequences for social stability and economic recovery. The effects of the hostilities were
seen in: the reduction of stock through direct damage and the destruction of 170,000 units (25 percent
of the housing stock in 1988); the displacement of 800,000 (22 percent of the population); the
reduction in households' ability to afford adequate housing, as a consequence of the erosion of real
income; the depletion of housing finance resources as a result of hyperinflation and severe losses in
the foreign exchange value of the Lebanese pound; the severe shortages in the supply of new housing
units for the middle- and lower-income groups; and the deterioration of the existing housing stock and
associated services due to overudlization and the lack of maintenance.
47.   The substantial decline in household real income levels that has occurred during the war
eroded the capacity to make payments on short-term loans at current interest rates. Also, long-term
housing finance resources - originally provided by insurance companies, social security funds,
household savings and government budgetary allocations - were depleted as a result of hyperinflation
and losses in the foreign exchange value of the Lebanese pound. Consequently, institutions providing
long-term financing to lower- and middle-income groups have been unable to generate long-term
financial resources on the local market to provide affordable loans to these groups.
48. Efforts to facilitate the rehabilitation of the damaged housing stock would greatly reduce
social hardships and enhance the Government's action plan for the return of displaced families to their
original homes. This plan is important to economic recovery, which relies heavily on the availability
of a stable labor force throughout the national territory.
49.   The National Emergency Reconstruction Program. The NERP allocates a total of
US$288.9 miUlion for housing. This allocation contains US$206.3 million to provide loans to initiate
a substantial program of rehabilitation for approximatey 55,000 damaged or destroyed dwellings,
US$66 million as public investment for the upgrading of long-standing informal housing areas, and
US$15 million for the resettlement program of the destroyed viUages. The NERP also provides
US$1.6 miUion for technical assistance to the Ministries of Housing and Displaced Persons.
Although no external funding commitments have been made, interest has been expressed by the Arab
Fund for Economic and Social Development and the Saudi Fund for Development.
50. The Emergency Reconstruction and Rebabilitation Project. The Bank ERRP would
provide a long-term loan (up to 15 years) of US$25 million to initiate a housing finance scheme for
the benefit of households whose housing conditions were seriously impaired as a result of the war. It
is expected that at least an equal amount would be provided by other donors, either on a grant basis
or on concessional terms, to reduce the cost of funds and make the loans affordable to households in
the middle-income groups. The loan would help rehabilitate and rebuild the existng housing stock of
households affected by the war and would, therefore, not necessarily directly benefit the poorest
segments of the population. In any event, the latter group would not be in a position to afford the on-
lending terms, and other government programs, such as the newly established Fund for the Displaced,
which would allocate grants to the poorer segments of households displaced during the war, are
expected to address their needs.
51.   The Beneficiaries. Ihe beneficiaries of the Housing Finance Scheme would be selected
from among the households whose housing conditions were seriously impaired as a result of the war
and who are considered creditworthy by the participating financial intermediaries, which would
assume the credit risk on the sub-loans. In order to meet the Government's objective of encouraging
the return of displaced families to their original home villages and towns, priority would be given to



- 27 -
displaced households. Beneficiaries targeted by the project would be primarily households who want
to repair or rebuild their only and primary dwelling and those who choose to construct a new
dwelling instead of rebuilding or repairing an original dwelling that has been destroyed. Renters and
owners of apartment buildings could benefit from the scheme if they overcame the legal issues related
to multi-ownership and rental agreements. Agreement was reached on detailed criteria for the
selection of beneficiaries with a view to excluding the wealthy and those who own more than one
house. Because income criteria are difficult to verify and apply, non-income criteria, such as the
maximum area of the dwelling unit, and a ceiling on loan amounts would be adopted to facilitate
targeting the middle-income households. The following criteria would be applied to determine the
eligibility of applicants to borrow under the scheme:
(i)    maximum area of the dwelling unit: the habitable area should not exceed 125 square
meters;
(ii)   creditworthiness: the applicant's creditworthiness would be assessed by the financial
intermediaries on the basis of the following elements: income level of household;
stability of income (stability of employment, quality of employer, salary
domiciliation); disposable resources for down payment; availability of security other
than the dwelling (cash or non-cash collateral by the beneficiary or by a third party);
(iii) social conditions of households: once creditworthiness has been established under (ii)
above, beneficiaries would be selected amongst the following categories listed by
order of priority: (a) displaced from either owned or rented accommodation that has
been damaged or destroyed; (b) living in damaged acoDmmodation that is either
owned or rented and willing either to repair the existing dwelling or to buy a new
dwelling; (c) households formed during the war (after December 31, 1975) and
presently sharing accommodation with another household in dwellings with a habitable
area not exceeding 140 square meters; and (d) households fobmed after December 31,
1975 that do not own a dwelling and are living in legal, but temporary,
accommodations.
52.   Implementation Arrangements and Procedures. Bank fimds would be lent to the
Government and deposited at the Banque du Liban (BdL), Lebanon's Central Bank, which would
administer them on the Government's behalf. Funds to be provided by donors other than the World
Bank would also be managed by the BdL, which would determine the average cost of funds from the
various donors and apply unified procedures for the disbursement and the recovery of funds from the
beneficiaries. BdL would re-lend the funds to a number of financial intrediares among those that
have been appraised by IFC (see pam 53). The selected financial intermediaries would then on-lend
the funds to beneficiaries, also in accordance with eligibility criteria agreed upon with the Bank (see
para. 51) and pursuant to terms and conditions outlined below. In order to give preference to the
displaced, the loans would be allocated to credit-worthy applicants listed under section 2 (ii) above in
accordance with a system satisfactory to the Bank. It is estimated that the Bank loan would be used
to finance expenditures of civil works contracts, goods and services related to the repair and the
reconstruction of damaged dwellings, and the construction of new dwellings built either by the
beneficiaries or by contractors. Ihe construction industry for housing throughout the county is
extremely competitive and materis are available from a wide range of suppliers.
53. The financal Intermediaries would comprise commercial banks that were recently appraised
by IFC for a credit line project of US$40 million to be used for investment projects in the private
sector. The participating banks (PBs) would be required to comply with the financial ratios of the
Bank of International Settlements (BIS) guidelines, which would be imposed by BdL in 1993. The



-28 -
following banks, which were appraised by IFC, are eligible to particileate in the scheme: Banque
Audi, Banque du Liban et d'Outre Mer, Fransabank, Bank of Beirut and the Arab Countries, Societe
Gendrale Libano Europeenne de Banque, and Byblos Bank. Tbe Housing Bank (HB) would be
eligible to participate after it complies with the same financial criteria as the commercial banks and
implements a restructuring plan that comprises recapitalization and institutionat strengthening. Any
PB would have the right to transfer under its own risk cover part or all of its loan portfolio to any
other eligible PB, or to the Housing Bank once the latter has been restructured and is considered
viable by the World Bank. The PBs would be required to enter into a subsidiary loan agreement
(SLA) with the BdL. The SLA, to be satisfactory to the World Bank, would provide arrangements on
sub-loan criteria (as described in paras. 52 to 56) but also on appraisal, supervision, procurement and
disbursement procedures and reporting requirements to the BdL and the World Bank.
54.   The loan amount to benefl'iaries would be determined on the basis of loan-to-value ratios of
40 percent of property value for rehabilitation and 80 percent for reconstruction of owned or rented
dwellings and the construction of new dwellings. To ensure targeting the middle-income groups, the
loan amount would also be subject to a ceiling of an absolute amount of US$40,000 for the repair,
reconstruction or construction of new dwellings. Loans for the construction of new dwellings would
not cover the price of land.
55.   The lending instrument would consist of loans denomiated in US dollars to be repaid over 5
or 15 years (up to 5 years for repairs and up to 15 years for reconstrction or the construction of new
dwellings). The interest rate charged to the beneficiaries would be sufficient to recover the full cost
of funds to the PBs including commercial risks and administrative costs. The interest rate would be
adjustable to reflect the changes in the interest rate charged by the Bank and by other donors. The
interest rate to be charged to the beneficiaries would be determined by the financial intermediries,
not to exceed 6 percent points above the average cost of funds to the PBs, to be determined by BdL.
The interest rate would also be related to the creditworthiness of the beneficiary and to the loan
repayment period.
56. Credit risks would be fully borne by the financial intermediaries, which would conduct full
appraisal of loan applications on the basis of technical, financial and commercial feasibility. It was
agreed that the financial intermediaries would assign all their rights and titles to the collateral obtained
from the beneficiaries to BdL.
57.   The World Bank funds would be disbursed only if additional funds are provided by other
donors at concessional terms to reduce the average cost of funds to a level not exceeding 70 percent
of the cost of the World Bank's fiunds. Such a reduction would make the loans affordable to the
middle income households whose real earnings have been eroded by the war (see para. 47). Also, at
the first annual review (expected in mid-1994) the Goverment and the World Bank will undertake a
critical review of the progress of the housing component. If progress is deemed less than satisfactdory
- in terms of reaching the targeted beneficiaries or meaninl demand on loans - the funds allocated
to the housing component would be either cancelled or reallocated to other components of the ERRP.
EDUCATIOQ
58. Background. Lebanon's well-educated population facilitated the development of a thriving
service sector, which played a key role in the national economy before the war. Education facilities
have suffered extensive damage and theft due to the war, and there is also considerable concern about
the quality of teaching at all levels. The quality of education is very important as Lebanon has few



- 29 -
natural resources and must depend on human skills for recovery and sustained development. It is,
therefore, an urgent priority to restore the capacity of the sector and enhance its capability. The
dramatic fall in living standards is exerting pressure on the demand for places in public schools as the
cost of private education becomes increasingly prohibitive. There are currently some 1,271 public
schols In Lebanon, about 10 percent fewer than those existing in 1974. Damage to existing
buildings and the loss of equipment severely constrains their potential capacity. Surveys during 1991
revealed that public schools for primary and secondary levels needed varying degrees of rehabilitation
at an estimated cost of US$45 million. Also, 18 out of the 22 vocational and technical training
colleges operated by the public sector are severely damaged and non-operational. Rehabilitation and
re-equipment costs are esdmated to be US$18.7 million.
59.   The National Emergency Reconstruction Program. The NERP allocated US$153.9 million
for the rehabilitation of physical facilities, including US$16.6 million for technical assistance. Priority
is given to universal primary education and technical/vocational training, which can more rapidly
benefit the economy. The aim is to: (i) rehabilitate public schools (primary and secondary levels) and
rebuild 30 schools that were totally destroyed (US$84.6 million); (ii) rehabilitate specific vocational
and technical training colleges at an esfimated cost of US$18.7 million; (iii) rehabilitate the Lebanese
University (US$21.0 million); (iv) rehabilitate teacher training colleges (US$13.0 million); and, (v)
provide technical assistance to upgrade teacher training programs and strengthen the institutional
capacity of the Ministries of National Education and Fine Art, Higher Education, and Technical
Education and Vocational Training (JS$16.6 million).
60.   Existng funding commitments for the NERP consist of: (a) US$10 million from the Islamic
Development Bank for the rehabilitation of the laboratory equipment in secondary schools; and (b) 8
million ECU (equivalent to US$10.4 million) from the EC eamarked for the reconstruction of 30
schools (primary and secondary levels) that have been totally destroyed (though the estimated cost for
this particular component amounts to US$22 million).
61.    The Emergency Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Project. The agreed ERRP would
provide US$15 million to finance the foreign exchange cost of: (a) the building rehabilitation works
for the government-owned technical and vocational facilities located throughout the national terity
(US$8.1 million); (b) the repair and replacement of equipment for all the facilities to be rehabilitated
(US$1.1 million); (c) the preparation and production of new stdent textbooks and teacher guides,
training seminars for personnel and strengthening the new Mnistry of Technical Education and
Vocational Training (US$5.2 million); and (d) consultant services for the preparation of engineering
studies, tender documes and the supervision of works (US$0.6 million). The total cost of this
component is estimated at US$18.7 million, of which the Government would need to finance the
equivalent of US$3.7 million in local cufrency. Upon completion of the rehabilitation works, it is
estimated that the number of students who would be trained in 17 different streams of skills that are
needed for the national reconstruction effort would increase from the current 3,300 to about 10,700
per year. (see Table 5 and the Project Document File).
62.   The location and configuration of the Vocational Training centers have been determined as
satisfactory on the basis of a recent UNESCO study. The streams for which curricula and teaching
material are to be prepared have been selected on the basis of an ILO study. However, both the final
configuration of training centers and the skill streams would be finalized in the light of further work
to be done during the early stages of project implementation, under Bank supervision. The cost
estimates for the rehabilitation of buildings are based on damage assessments prepared by CDR
consultants and reviewed by a klcally recruited Bank consultant. These costs will be oonfirmed when
detailed specification and tender documents are prepared by consultan  to be financed by proceeds of
the ERRP.



- 30 -
63.   Implementation Arrangements. The building rehabilitation and associated consulting
services (items (a) and (d) of para. 61) would be implemented by a Sector Implementation Unit (SIU)
to be located in the Directorate of Buildings of the Ministry of Public Works, which is normally in
charge of the construction of all government-owned buildings. The remaining parts related to the
repair of equipment, preparation of training material, taining seminars and strengthening of the
Ministry of Technical Education and Vocational Training (MTEVT) (items (b) and (c) of para. 61)
would be implemented by the MTEVT. The MTEVT and the SIU in the Ministry of Public Works
would coordinate their work to ensure timely completion of civil works and the delivery of equipment
(see Part m and Note I of this Annex).
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
64.   Objective. The technical assistance component is an important element of the proposed
project as it provides a sound basis for starting to rebuild the public institutions that were severely
affected by the war. lt was assessed that the institutional capacity building objective is vital and
would have an important positive effect on the sustainability of the investments to be financed under
the ERRP. The purpose of the US$10 million technical assistance (TA) component is to provide
support to the central government to achieve the following objectives: (a)  agt builing: to
strengthen the capabilities of key institutions in economic management; (b) oliar deve  to
design and implement sectoral policies; and (c) institutional and regulatory reforms: to prepare and
implement part of the Government's restructuring program for the infrastructure sectors; to prepare
strategies and an action plan; and to strengthen the institutional and regulatory framework for the
sector in which the public utilities services operate. Agreement was reached on the targeted priority
areas: the Ministry of Finance, telecommunications, electricity, water and solid waste. Terms of
reference were prepared and agreed for most of the subprojects and are included in the project file.
65.   Description. The TA would accomplish these objectives through funding to support the
following priority activities:
(a)    Ministry of Finance: US$0.4 million would finance a program to enhance revenue collection
and strengthen economic and fnancial management.
(b)    Telecommunications sector (US$6.65 million):
(i)    US$1.5 million in consulting services to assist in restrucuring the sector with a view
to commercialize telecommunications services. This would include separating the
operation and maintenance of telecommunications from the Ministry and creating an
independent joint-stock company; assessing alternatives for private sector
participation; and preparing a new regulatory franework; and
(ii)   US$5.15 million to finance a management contract with an experienced, private
telecommunications utility operator. This utility would help improve the management
of the Ministry operation, facilitate the efficient rehabilitation of existing assets,
improve operations and maintenance and help introduce a privadzation scheme.



- 31 -
(c)    Power sector (US$2.5 million):
(i)    US$0.25 million to finance a long-term consultant, for a period of two years, to assist
the Minister of Hydraulic and Electric Resources in rehabilitating, restructuring and
developing the power sector;
(ii)   US$1.85 million to finance a technical assistance contract with an experienced
international electric utility operator to assist the Ministry and EdL. Assistance is
required in various functions including MIS, finance, accounting, billing collection,
human resources development and training. This assistance would improve the
management of the operation and would facilitate the efficient rehabilitation of assets,
improve operations and maintenance and train EdL staff; and
(iii)   US$0.4 million in consulting services to: (a) define a long-term strategy for the
efficient development of the sector with both public as well as private participation;
(b) articulate options to restructure the sector, taking into account the experience in
countries that have undergone power sector reforms but keeping in mind specific
Lebanese conditions; (c) define the regulatory framework that would provide an
indePendent and transparent regulation of the power secor while attracting fbreign
and private capital; and (d) promote environmentally sound operations.
(d)    Solid Waste and Wastewater: US$0.2 million in consulting services would cover a study to
recommend a long-term strategy for solid waste management and identify measures for the
development of efficient solid waste management services.
(e)    Water sector: US$0.25 million would finance a long-term consultant for a period of two
years to assist the Minister of Hydraulic and Electric Resources in reorganizing and
restructuring the water sector.
66.   Cost and Elnandng. The cost of the TA to be fnanced by the project is estimated at US$10
million (see Table 6). The TA would finance 100 percent of the following costs: (a) consultant
services, either international or local firms or individuals recruited in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines; and (b) the procurement of equipment, e.g., computer hardware and software for use by
government staff in the context of services provided by the consultants.
ID. INSITTUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEENTATION
67.   The NERP and the ERRP would be implemented over a threeyear period by the CDR and
existing sector ministries and agencies. The institutional arrangements for implementation are based
on the general principle that the CDR is responsible for program management, whereas the line
ministries and agencies are responsible for program implementation. As an exception to that general
principle, the CDR would also be responsible for the implementation of projects not specifically
allocated to a line ministry or agency. Such "special projects" are projects that are cr-sectoral and
go outside the boundaries of ministries, are "orphan" projects, or are projects with special
circumstances that the Council of Ministers wishes the CDR to implement. Also, in order to take
advantage of its simpler and less time-consuming procedures, the CDR would be in charge of
procurement, payments and disbursements for the NERP and the proposed World Bank loan.
Detailed implementation arrangements, including the distribution of responsibilities between the CDR
and ministries and agencies, are presented in the attached Note 1.



-32 -
68.   Seventeen years of war have severely damaged public administration, which has suffered a
loss of trained capable people. Unfortunately, those civil servants who have remained are often
struggling to survive on inadequate salaries and have litde or no opportunity to renew or modernize
their skills. The Government is aiming at achieving sustainable improvement in public sector
institutions over the long term; it has also devised a short-term strategy to increase immediately the
implementation capacity of public administration. In order to implement the NERP and the ERRP
effectively and efficiently, the CDR and sector ministries and agencies would be strengthened with the
establishment of a Program Management Unit (PMU) within the CDR and Sectoral Implementation
Units (SIUs) within the relevant ministries and agencies. The teams of consultants recruited to staff
these units would be integrated within the existing structures; they would set up appropriate methods,
work organization and management procedures for the implementation of the program and also
provide on-the-job training to the local staff affiliated with these units. There would be eight SIUs for
the NERP, as follows:
(a)    Water Supply and Wastewater: SW within the Ministry of Hydraulic and Electric
Resources
(b)   Electricity: SIU within the Ministry of Hydraulic and Electric Resources
(c)    Solid Waste: SIU within the Ministry of Environment
(d)   Telecommunications: SIU within the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications
(e)    Public buildings (including schools) and roads: SIU within the Ministry of Public
Works
(f)    Finance: SIW within the Ministry of Finance
(g)    Ports and Airports: SIU within the Ministry of Transport
(h)   Other SIU for productive sectors: within CDR
69.   In order to ensure proper coordination, the CDR would establish an advisory body, called the
Technical Coordination Committee (rCC), consisting of senior memnbers of the SIlUs and PMU and a
representative from the EC. Sectoral planning for project and contact execution would be a key
coordination focus.
70. The PMU of the CDR would include 20 consultants working within the 4 divisions of CDR
(e.g., Program, Project Management, Finance and Administration). The 8 SWUs would include 44
consultants. For the three-year implementation period, the cost of the PMU and SIlUs, including
equipment and operating costs and 10 percent contingencies, but excluding the Lebanese
Government's contribution (assigned staff, offices, etc.), is estimated at US$14.9 million equivent
for the PMU and US$40.7 million equivalent for the nine SIUs. Most of these costs would be
financed by the EC.
71.   Procuent. It was agreed that procurement under the project would be handled by the
CDR. The reasons for adopting this procedure are (i) the cumbersome and time-consuming
procurement procedures under standard government regulations; (Ci) the streamlined procedures
applicable to procurement by the CDR; and (iii) the economies of scale ta can be achieved though
bulk procurement. Procurement methods for works, goods and services to be financed under the
proposed loan are summarized in Schedule B of the MOP. Because of the urgent nature of the



- 33 -
project, part of the procurement would be undertaken using simplified competitive bidding procedures
in accordance with Bank Guidelines. A procurement notice advertising the project has been published
in the United Nations' Development Business, and the CDR has published the same notice in the local
press and has distributed it to embassies represented in Beirut. Detailed procurement arrangements
are set out in the attached Note 2.
72.   Disbursements. Given the emergency nature of the proposed project, the implementation
period would be 36 months, and the Bank loan would be disbursed over 40 months. The additional
four months have been provided to allow for the completion of disbursements. Schedule B in the
Memorandum of the President shows the estimated loan disbursements by semester.
73.   The proposed Bank loan of US$175 million equivalent would be disbursed against the
categories and at rates stated below:
(1)   Civil Works: 90 percent prior to July 1, 1994; 60 percent from July 1, 1994 to June
30, 1995; and 30 percent thereafter
(2)   Equipment and materials: 100 of foreign expenditures; 100 percent of local
expenditures (ex-factory cost); and, 80 percent of local expenditures for items
procured locally
(3)   Consultants' services: 100 percent
(4)   Sub-loans for housing: 100 percent
74.   Ful documentation would be submitted to the World Bank in support of withdrawal
applications with respect to civil works, materials, equipment, consultant services and the sub loan for
expenditures in excess of US$50,000 equivalent. Expenditures for these categories at or below
US$50,000 equivalent would be reimbursed against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs), for which the
related documentation would be retained for review by World Bank supervision missions.
75. Retroactive 1lnancing. In view of the emergency nature of the social service requirements,
the irastructure works and the strained foreign exchange position of the Government, retroactive
financing up to US$13.0 million from the proceeds of the World Bank loan is proposed for
eitures incurred after appraisad but before loan signing, comprising funds for consultants
services (engineer  designs and preparation of tender documents) and urgent civil works in the solid
waste incinerator and the compost plant in Beirut.
76.   Special Account. In order to facilitate rapid disburements, the Government will establish
two Special Accounts, one to be operated by CDR, the other by BdL, under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the World Bank. An inital deposit of US$13.0 million in the case of CDR and of
US$2.0 million in the case of BdL would be made to the respective Special Accounts. Both CDR and
BdL would maintain the Special Accounts as a separate identifiable account for the project's
expenditures and retain all supporting documentation for subsequent review by the World Bank
supervision missions. CDR and BdL would also provide the World Bank with a monthly statement of
their respective Special Accounts. On, at least, a monthly basis or when one half of the initial deposit
has been utilized, CDR or BdL woud submit a replenishment request to the World Bank with the
necessary supporting documentation for funds withdrawn from their respective Special Accounts.
77. Accounts and Audits. CDR is the designated representative of the Borrower for withdrawing
the proceeds of the World Bank loan, except in respect of the housing component where BdL is the



- 34 -
designated representative. CDR and BdL would each keep separate accounts for project expenditures
in accordance with accounting principles and practices acceptable to the World Bank. These accounts
and the two Special Accounts would be audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable to the
Bank, and copies of the audited statements would be forwarded to the Bank within six months of the
end of the CDR fiscal year.
78.   Supervision Plan. Project supervision would be the responsibility of the Project Task
Maager, who would be assisted by specialists for the sectoral components. A project-launch mission
would be fielded after Board approval (say April, 1993) to ensure that arrangements for project
implementation, including those for procurement and disbursements, were in place and were
satisfactory to the Bank. The proposed mission is needed because the Lebanese Government and its
implementing agencies have not dealt with the Bank for nearly a decade, and, therefore, Bank
procedures need to be explained and understood to avoid delays in disbursements. The proposed
mission would consist of the Task Manager and advisors on procurement and disbursement.
Participating donors would also be invited to take part. In the period between appraial and Board
presentation, limited supervision would be required to review and clear bidding documents and terms
of reference of consultants to expedite implementation.
79.   From May 1993 to November 1994, supervision missions would visit Lebanon at four-month
intervals. By November 1994, the mid-term review would require an expanded mission consisting of
the Task Manager, a sector specialist for each component and a financial analyst. Donors would be
asked to participate in the mid-term review mission. Subsequendy, supervision missions consisting of
the Task Manager and one or two specialists would visit Lebanon every six monfts. About 10 staff
weeks would be needed for the project launch mission in FY93; 30 staff weeks would be needed
during PY94 for supervision; 35 staff weeks, during FY95; and 25 staff weeks, during FY96. The
cost of supervision would be reduced by using the services of local consultants.
AREEhffNTS REACHED
80.   During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on the following actions:
(a)    A yearly review to be held not later than September 30 of each year until completion
of the project to assess progress achieved in project implementation.
(b)    Budget allocations to be provided for the recurrent costs that could not be covered
through internal cash generation.
(c)    Operation and maitenance services to be contracted to private sector firms wherever
a ministry or public agency was institutionaly incapable of adequately performing
these tasks.
(d)    Government to submit by December 31, 1993, an action plan to improve cost
recovery in the power, water, wastewater and solid waste sectors to generate sufficient
revenue to fuNd operations, maintenance and recurrent costs.
81.   As a condition of the disbursement of each component of the loan (except housing) , the
Govenment would establish the corresponding SIU with staffing and terms of reference acceptable to
the Bank, or put in place such alternative implementation arrangement as shall be satisfactory to the
Bank. Funds for the housing component of the loan wfll be disbursed only after the following
conditions are satisfied: (i) the Government obtains additional funds from other donors at



- 35 -
concessionary terms which, when pooled with the Bank funds will reduce the average cost of fiuds to
the participating banks to a level not exceeding 70 percent of the cost of the Bank funds; and (id) BdL
has concluded participating agreements acceptable to the Bank, with at least three financial
intermediaries.

lE IM E l G C Y lUE CONS  Rl    ON AMN RHAUT   EOM
Impementation Auv-Mensan
1.    General. The NERP and the ERRP would be implemented over a three-year period by the CDR
and existing sector ministries and agencies. The institutional arrangements for implementation are based
on the general principle that the CDR is responsible for program management whereas the line ministries
and agencies are responsible for program implementation. As an exception to that general principle, the
CDR would also be responsible for the implementation of projects not specifically allocated to a line
minstry or agency. Such "special projects" are projects that are cross-sectoral and go outside the
boundaries of ministries, "orphan* projects, or projects with special circumstances, which the Council
of Ministers wishes the CDR to implement. Also, in order to take advantage of its simpler and less tme-
consuming procedures, the CDR would be in charge of contracting, payments and disbursements for the
NERP and the ERRP.
2.    Overall Program Management by CDR. The CDR is ersed with the overaUl responsibility
for the implementation of the NERP. Its organization structure consists of four divisions: Program,
Project Management, Finamce, and Administration. These divisions (59 professionals) do not have
adequate experience nor enough competence to cope with the implementation (monitoring, management
and coordination) of this program. Moreover, they do not have at their disposal adequate methods and
management tools for the efficient monitoring of the program, or for handling the workload resulting
from the implementation of the program. Therefore, they would be strengthened with a team of
experienced consultants. This team of consultants, together with CDR divisions, would be the PMU for
the NERP and ERRP.
3.    The main responsibilities of the PMU would be the following:
(a)    OveraHl planming, programming and budgetting
(b)    Coordination of sectoral planning proposals by sector ministuies
(c)    Allocations between sectors and the identification of priority projects
(d)   The mobilization of funds to finance approved programs
(e)    Contractng for civil works. goods and services (draftng the general conditions part of
the bidding documents in . ,ultation with line ainistries and agencies; catling for bids;
organizing and chairing the tender evaluation committee, with the participation of line
ministries and agencies; and signing contracts)
(f)    Payments to suppliers and contractors upon receipt of appropriate domeation from
line minities and agencies
(g)    Disburemen  of loans and grants obtained to finane the program (including the
proposed World Bank loan) and of the government conterpart conbutions and the
management of any special account that may be established
(h)   Facilitating the implementation of the projects by line ministies and agencies (for
example, by making avable to them speciized exptise on a short-term basis)

C:)    The implementation of 'special projects" (storm water drainage, the airport, ports, and
other productive sectors)
(j)    Overall program monitoring (including maintaining a program implementation schedule
and an expenditure forecast and control system' and reports to the Council of Ministers
and donors on the progress of the program
4.    The PMU would be constituted from four divisions of the CDR by drawing on their permaent
staff and on the consultants providing assistance to their divisions. All resident consultants would be
integrated in CDR divisions and would report to the relevant division heads. The team leader would be
responsible for the quality of the work performed by the consultants, and for the coordination between
consutants and division heads. The four divisions heads and the team leader would constitute a
pertaanent task force in charge of the coordination of work between divisions; It would identify and solve
problems caused by any administrative bottlenecks that might adversely affect the performance of the
PMU. This task force would report directy to the President of the CDR.
5.    The team of consultants would be recruited under a contract with a single firm. They would
carry out the following tasks:
(a)    Setting appropriate methods, work organization and management procedures for the
implementation of the program, including the implementation of a management
information system and of a reporting framework
(b)    Participating directly in CDR work, to help the four divisions perform their duties
efficienty and to provide on-the-job training to thaeir personnel
(c)    Assisting the heads of divisions and departments in the planing of operations and the
assignment of tasks amongst their teams
(d)    Contributing to the streamlining of the work of the CDR divisions
(e)    Compensating for any shortage of expertise within these four divisions
6.    In the light of needs identified in the various CDR divisions, the composition of the team of
consultants would be the following:
(a)    One team leader
(b)    Seven consultants appointed to the Program  Division (one economist, three
planning/programming specialists, one social sector specialist, one project identification
specialist and one appraisal specialist)
(c)    Six consultants appointed to the Project Management Division (two public contract
specialists and four specialized engineers)
(d)    Six consultants appointed to the Finance Division (one expariate specialist in
international contracts or tenders and five local consultants - one financial analyst, three
university graduate accountants, and one computer specialist)
(e)    One international law specialist appointed to the Adminisative Division
7.    Program Implementation. Program implementation would be the responsibility of the SWUs in
sector ministies and agencies and, in exceptional cases, in the CDR. These SIUs would be entrusted
with the management and supervision of the implementation of sectoral programs as well as with
instituonal support to these sectors.



- 38-                            NOTE I
Page 3 of 6
8.    Ihe SILTs would be responsible for the following tascs:
(a)    Proposals for sectoral planning, including the preparadon of master plans, feasibility
studies for specific projects and the preparatory work for the appointment of consultants
(b)    Supervision of the preparation of detailed engiing and tender documents and contract
packaging
(c)    The management of consultants (for master plans, feasibility studies. engineering, project
supervision, operation and main ce, institutional development, etc.)
(d)    AUl the technical aspects of the procurement of goods and services (prequalification,
technical specifications to be included in the tender documents and participation in the
preparation of tender documents and in tender evaluation)
(e)    The monitoring of contract and project supervision (including schedules and cost control,
project accounts and progress) and the preparation of the necessary doc ion for
submission to the CDR for payments to contractors and suppliers under the various loans
and grants. On this basis, the CDR would be responsible for the actl payment of funds
under the World Bank loan, the govermment cash counterpart contribution and other
participating donor funds, according to each institution's disbursement guidelines
(f)    Periodic reporting to the CDR and others
(g)    The management of studies and actions required for organizational and instutional
development, proper operation and mintnance and adequate cost recovery
9.    The SIUs would have full responsibility and accountability for the technically related project
featres; for contract administration, they would have a delegation of authority from the CDR (the
employer) to act as "mattre d'oeuvre delEguE" in accordance with procedures that would be spelled out
in detail.
10.   Eight priority SIUs have been identified:
(a) Water Supply and Wastewater: SIU within the Ministry of Hydraulic and Electric
Resources
(b)    Electricity: SIT within the Ministry of Hydraulic and Electric Resources
(c)    Solid Waste: SW within the Mistry of Environment
(d) Telecommunications: SIU within the Ministry of Pos and Telecommunications
(e)    Public Works (public buildings and roads): SIU within the Ministry of Public Works
(f)    Finance: SIU within the Ministry of Finance
(g)    Ports and Airports: SW within the Ministry of Transport
(h)    SW for other productive sectors: within CDR
11.   For Telecommunications, the role of the SW would be management only (technical support may
not be required), and for Finance the role of the SW would be essentially for diagnosis, institutional
support and coordination (including assistance in various areas of economic management and in the design
and implementation of a social safety net). For all other SIUs, the main tasks to be performed by the
teams of consulants would be the following:
(a)    Preparing and putting into operation the technical supervision of sectoral progrums and
projects and direchly performing SIU activities in coordination with civil aI ion
employees affiliated with the SW



- 39 -                           NM  IE 
Page 4 of 6
(b)    Providing technical support in aUl matters relating to managemen, operation and
maintenance activities in the institutions they belong to and on-the-job trainig of civil
administration employees affiliated with the SIU
(c)    Preparing periodic reports to the Directorate General of the ministry to which they are
affiliated, the CDR and other concened authorities
12.   The SIUs would report directly to the Director General of the institution they belong to, and the
SIU located in the CDR would report to the head of the Project Management Division in the CDR. Each
SIU would include a team of consultants, plus an equivalent number of staff from the related ministry
or agency and one representative from the CDR, all of them working under the authority of the leader
of the team of consultants. SIUs would consist of a relatively small number of consultants since separate
consultants would be employed and managed by the SIUs to carry out some of the tasks (for example,
project design and field supervision) for which the SIUs are responsible. It is estimated that for the 8
SIUs, a total of 44 expatriate consultants would be required, as detailed below.
a.      Water Supply and Wastewater     8
b.      Electricity                     10
C.      Solid Waste                     4
d.      Telecommunications              4
e.      Public Works                    5
f.      Finance                         4
g.      Ports and Airports              6
h.      Other Productive Sectors        3
TOTAL                          44
13.   For the three and one half year implementation period, the costs of the PMU and SIUs, including
equipment and operating costs, but excluding the Lebanese Government's contribution (assigned staff,
offices, etc.), are estimated at US$14.9 million equivalent for the PMU and US$40.7 million equivalent
for the 9 SIUs.
14.   Coordination. Good coordination between the PMU and the SIUs is essential for the successful
implementation of the NERP. In order to ensure proper coordination, the CDR would establish an
advisory body, called the Technical Coordination Committee (CC), consisting of high-level members
of the SIUs and the PMU and a representative from the EC. Sectoral planning for project and contract
execution would be a key coordination focus. At the beginning, the TCC would have to meet weeMy,
but later on meetins would not have to be as frequent. Minutes of meedngs and recommendations of
the TCC would be transmitted to the President of the CDR and to the relevant Director General. More
specifically, the main tasks of the TCC would be to:
(a)    Harmonize common procedures
(b)   Identify possible bottlenecks, namely administrative ones, and formulate adequate
solutions
(c)    Coordinate the progress and phasing of sectoral projects that might interfre with otder
sectoral programs

(d)    Establish progress reports of works in various sectors, including recommendations for
changes in sectoral programs, if necessary
(e)    Evaluate and harmonize the strengthening of institutional actions in various sectors

EMERGENCY RECONSTRUCTION AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
Procurement Procedures
1.    The Procurement Notice advertising the ERRP was published in the December 31, 1992 edition
of the UN Development Business. The CDR has published the notice in the local press and has provided
copies to all governments represented in Beirut. Because of the emergency nature of the project, no
further international advertising of the project would be required, except for equipment and materials for
the water and wastewater, solid waste and electricity components. Items to be procured under Local
Competitive Bidding (LCB), i.e., civil works for the solid waste component, would be adverised locally.
Procurement packages have been agreed and sized as large as feasibly possible to help ensure economies
in the procrement exercise.
2.    It has been agreed that all procurement would be in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines and
that the Bank's Sample Bidding Documents would be used for all contracts including those covered under
local competitive bidding. Prior to Board presentation, formal administrative procedures would be agreed
to be followed by the CDR and the SIUs in the preparation, bidding, evaluation and award of contracts
financed by the Bank.
TIM NATIONAL COMPETIT[VE BIDDING amO
3.    Supply-and-Install Contracts. The Bank-financed contracts for the supply-and-install contracts
for equipment and materials for the water and wastewater and electricity components (total amount
US$75.0 million) would be procured through ICB procedures acceptable to the Bank. The works covered
by these contracts are required by the Government to be completed as soon as possible. CDR consultants
would be appointed and financed by the EC (for detailed design and construction supervision of the first
year of the water and wastewater and electricity components) as extensions of exisdng EC-financed
contracts because of the urgency of the assignment. Consultants, under Bank's Guidelines, would be
appointed during 1993 for the detailed design and construction supervision of the remainder of the works
for these two components. These consultants would prepare bidding documents based on the World Bank
Sample Bidding Documents for the procurement of works, which should permit Bank review to be
expedited. Because the completion of these components is urgently needed, the bidding period would be
reduced to 60 days. This period would begin immediately after the issuance of the procurement
notification that bidding documents were available. The notification would be delivered to all member
governments rerented in Beirut and sent by telex to those contractors who were prequalified and
suppliers who registered an interest in response to the above-mentioned advertisement. The CDR would
arrange to courier copies of the bidding documents to interested companies. The award of any contrc
would be subject to the post-qualification of the supplier. Criteria for this post-Vqualification would be
included in the bid docunments.
4.    Goods, Equipment and Materials. With the exception of the equipment (US$20.3 million) for
the solid waste component, and the materials (US$6.1 million) for the education component, the packages
to be provided under Bank financing are relatively small (spare parts would be provided under the above
supply-and-install contracts). Those with values in excess of $0.5 million would be procured dtrough ICB
in accordance with Bank's guidelines and would account for about US$22.0 million.

LOCAL COMPTI-TIVE BIDDING (LCB)
5.    Civil Works and Building Contracts. LCB would be largely associated with the construction
of the 13 landfill and transfer stations (total amount $12.8 million) for the solid waste component and the
construction of 3 schools and the rehabilitation of 16 others (total amount $11.0 million) for the education
component. For efficiency, he contracts would be packaged into a maximum of three solid waste
components and two school components. Even with this pctkaging, it is unlikely that foreign contractors
would be interested in bidding because of the dispersed nature of the sites, the relatively small amount
of each of the contracts and the nature of the work. Contractors who respond to the initial notice (para.
1) would be prequalified by the CDR, and all prequalified contractors would be invited to bid.
INTERNATIONAL SHOPPING
6.    International shopping may be used for the procurement of equipment and materials financed from
the proceeds of the proposed loan. Procurement for lots with values of less than US$500,000 may be
done by international shopping. For intemational shopping, no formal bidding documents are required;
however, the Bank would be informed of the shortlist of suppliers who would be approached for
quotations (these shall be at least three in number and from at least two eligible countries). The aggregate
total of procurement via international shopping for the ERRP may not exceed $2.0 million.
L          LS ITRNA IDDINGam
7.    Replant and Spare Parts. The procurement of about $2.2 million worth of parts for
specialized equipment (such as pumps, generators and uansfms) would be made through LIB, which
would be open to all known suppliers who have responded to the above-mentioned advertisement. It may
be necessary to award some contracts directly through negotiated contracts with the original suppliers of
the equipment.
REW-BY THE BAK
S.    Prior review by the Bank of bidding documents, shortlists of bidders and recommendations for
awards would be reqWired for al packages estimated to be worth more than US$250,000. The estimated
percentage of procurement subject to the Bank's prior review would be more than 95 percent.
EVALUAION OF BIDS
9.    Iwvitations to bid would request CEF delivery to one of the four international ports in Leaon -
the acta choice of port being left to the bidder. Bid prices would include the cost to the port of choice
and transportation to the site or store where the equipment or materials are to be used.
10. Consultants contracts, which are to be financed from the proceeds of the loan, are estimated to
cost about US$16.7 million. With the exception of the consultants for the first year of the deailed design
and construction supervision for the electricity, water and wastewater components (ars. 3), cosltants

would be selected in accordance with the *Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by the World Bank
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency." AU Bank-financed consultancy contracts would
be subject to prior Bank review.
