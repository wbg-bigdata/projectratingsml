1. URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT'
A. URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
1.1   Over the past 20 years, China has developed an environmental protection system
employing a broad set of control instruments administered through environmental
protection bureaus at all levels of government. A national environmental action plan has
been developed to coordinate domestic environmental improvement efforts. China has
also been a responsive partner in international efforts to control pollution and was one of
the first countries to finish their Agenda 21 program following the Rio conference.
1.2   China has, despite this proactive approach, had mixed success in implementing
their environmental policy. Some aspects of the record are quite good-airborne total
suspended particulate (TSP) concentrations have been markedly reduced in cities in both
north and south China (see Figure 1.1) and state-owned enterprise discharges of toxic
metals in wastewater have fallen substantially. However, even with reductions in TSP,
ambient concentrations remain above international and Chinese guidelines in many cities
and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions have not been effectively constrained (see Figure 1.1).
In line with rapidly increasing urbanization and economic growth, the demands made on
water resources are exceeding supply. Water pollution continues to grow; polluted urban
aquifers have increased from 20 percent in 1983 to 45 percent today. In the most recently
published water quality survey, sections of rivers in 54 of 58 reporting cities failed to
meet even the lowest acceptable standard, leaving few economic uses-except as waste
sinks.
1.3   The social cost of this pollution is high. Over 400 million Chinese live in cities, a
number expected to increase to some 800 million by 2010; annual premature deaths in
urban China due to TSP are currently estimated at over 150,000. Other epidemiological
work has shown a strong relationship between outdoor SO2 concentrations and mortality
in northern Chinese cities. The health costs of water pollution are more difficult to
measure. Raw water pollution has forced cities to move to increasingly distant and more
expensive raw water sources; farmers have had to switch from irrigation with surface
water to pumping groundwater, and fisheries have been damaged.
For a detailed discussion please see "China: Environmental Strategy Paper" (Report No. 9669-CHA,
April 1992); and "China: Urban Environmental Service Management" (Report No. 13073-CHA,
December 1994).

WHO Guidelines
1.4    The reasons for the growing pollution are not difficult to identify. A coal-based
fuel system firing a large stock of inefficient boilers and power plants contributes to air
quality problems, as does widespread dependence on coal stoves for household cooking
and heating. With urban growth and rising personal incomes have come rapid increases
in the volume of municipal wastewater flows-they grew from 7 billion cubic meters
(ni3) annually in 1984 to 13 billion m3 in 1992. Those came with the growth of in-house
water connections and of washing machines and flush toilets. Industrial wastewater
discharges in urban areas declined over that same period, as reuse and other water-saving
techniques increased water use efficiency. Solid waste generation has grown rapidly, and
only some 25 percent of the municipal solid waste and nightsoil are disposed of to
national standards. The remainder is dumped at uncovered dumping sites without
leachate or gas control facilities.



- 3 -
1.5   The nature of the discharges affecting the urban environment dictate a mix of
regulatory and investment responses by different levels of government. These have been
discussed in two Bank studies, the first analyzing overall environmental circumstances
and policy (China: Environmental Strategy Paper, Report No. 9669-CHA, April 1992)
and the second that is specific to the urban sector (China: Urban Environmental Service
Management, Report No, 13073-CHA, December 1994). As described in those reports,
municipal governments must seek an efficient mix of point source control through
regulation and collective treatment of wastes.
B. REGULATION OF POINT SOURCE POLLUTION
1.6   The regulation of point source pollution falls to the National Environmental
Protection Agency (NEPA), as the secretariat of the State Council Environmental
Protection Committee.  NEPA  drafts national regulations and other aspects of
enviromnental policy for consideration by the State Council and National People's
Congress. NEPA has the power to interpret national environmental regulations and
standards, including those governing the operations of the local environmental protection
bureaus (EPB) that work at provincial and municipal level. However, NEPA lacks
implementation authority, a power left to local governments and the EPBs under them.
1.7   Provincial governments are authorized to set local environmental standards in the
absence of preemptive national standards, or to impose more stringent standards than
those required by the national government. Provincial EPBs coordinate these policies
and, in contrast to NEPA, may play a direct role in implementation. However, the
municipal, urban district and county EPBs bear the main burden of enforcement for both
national and provincial regulations. The budgets, personnel appointments, and work
plans of each level EPB derive from the government of that level. To aid quality control,
performance must be reported to the next higher administrative level EPB, which also
sets testing protocols and other performance criteria.
1.8   China's regulatory approach has focused on three instruments: environmental
assessment before approval of new projects; the "three simultaneous" licensing strategy
that requires integration of pollution control in project design, inclusion of the abatement
measures in the actual investment, and proper operation of the abatement equipment; and
a pollution levy fee chargeable against waste streams that have concentrations of
pollutants above permitted levels. More recently, governments have been authorized to
levy a small charge on wastewater discharges within standards.
1.9   The pollution levy fees are used mainly to finance pollution abatement in eligible
enterprises. The handling of the earmarked funds has shifted over time from being
granted directly back to the enterprise paying the fee to lending the funds on concessional
terms for eligible pollution control investments.
1.10 NEPA now recognizes two problems with the pollution levy fee system. First,
fees are typically set considerably below the marginal cost of effluent treatment, which
encourages enterprises to pay the fee rather than operate or invest in treatment facilities or
cleaner production technologies. Second, setting fees on the basis of concentration-based



-4 -
standards may lead to dilution as a means of compliance or reducing fee rates, and
surface waters receiving discharges could fail to meet standards even though all
enterprises in a watershed individually meet standards. Conversely, if assimilative
capacity is high and enterprises few, the concentration standard could force compliance
costs far above the damage done by the discharge.
1.11  Two more regulatory issues originate in structural features of the economy. The
first arises from the fact that local governments usually own the major enterprises within
their boundaries, leading to pressures to relax regulation or fee collection in the interest of
employment and profits. The second is that the enterprises operating on the periphery of
cities may have a large impact on municipal environmental quality, yet fall outside
municipal control. This latter problem is particularly acute with the small-scale township
and village industrial enterprises (TVIEs). Individual TVIEs' enforcement costs are high
relative to output, yet in the aggregate, TVIE pollution has a large impact on the
downstream environment.
1.12 NEPA has a large research and experimentation program under way to identify
new approaches to overcome these and other regulatory problems. Among these
initiatives is the use of catchment-specific mass-based pollution permits to replace the
concentration-based standards and fees. More generally, NEPA seeks effective market-
based pollution control mechanisms to complement the national shift to a market-based
economy and to avoid many of the problems of enterprise-specific regulation. The Bank
supports NEPA's program through the Environmental Technical Assistance Project
(Credit 2522-CHA) and investment projects such as the one now proposed.
C. COLLECTIVE WASTE HANDLING AND TREATMENT
1.13  Urban environmental services, which include wastewater collection and treatment
systems and solid waste collection and treatment, fall under the purview of the
Construction Commissions found in every Chinese city. Overall regulatory guidance and
standard setting is provided by the Ministry of Construction and the provincial
Construction Bureaus. The Ministry and Bureaus set national and provincial policy for
urban and regional planning, infrastructure development planning, and facility operating
standards. They also specify financial accounting procedures and goals. Based on those
policies and standards, the municipal commissions provide or regulate providers of the
actual service. The municipal commissions are typically among the largest and most
powerful of the municipal administrative bodies, having under them bureaus or
companies directly providing key urban services.
1.14  Chinese cities are characterized by a good correspondence between expenditure
responsibility and control over revenue. This sets them apart from cities in many
developing countries, which have been characterized by inadequate funding to meet
mandated services. Chinese cities also tend to have well-staffed administrations, with
their broad control over the local economy making them an attractive employer. These
advantages have helped China achieve piped water supply to nearly 90 percent of all
urban residents, but has not automatically led to high levels of service in every field. The



- 5 -
low level of adequate solid waste disposal was cited earlier and local watercourses
continue to serve as both drains and sewers for nearly 40 percent of the area of Chinese
cities. Wastewater treatment levels are low, with only 4.5 percent of municipal flows
treated in 1992. Cities have given priority to water supply, roads, and enterprise
investment over environmental services. Yet rapidly growing problems with raw water
quality are forcing recognition across cities that wastes need to be adequately handled.
1.15 The major policy problem identified in China: Urban Environmental Service
Management was the failure to charge, or charge adequately, for environmental services.
Although cities have long charged for water delivery, residential wastewater charges are
virtually unknown, while charges to enterprises have been rare, and where collected, fall
far below operating needs. Solid waste collection fees are charged more often, but those
services still require substantial subsidies. An important consequence of this failure to
charge adequate user fees is that service investment programs have failed to meet goals
due to lack of finance. The Ministry of Construction estimates that two thirds of the
municipal wastewater treatment plants either do not operate, or operate far below capacity
due to lack of funds. Moreover, when users do not have to pay, they have no incentive to
reduce waste volumes. This creates the need for larger service systems when they are
provided.
D. BANK GROUP SECTOR STRATEGY
1.16 The Bank Group highlighted enhancing environmental protection and reducing
infrastructure bottlenecks as two of the five areas of concentration under the China
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Board on March 18, 1997. Our
close collaboration with the Chinese government covers both the regulatory and service
provision aspects of urban environmental management. The China: Environmental
Strategy Paper sector study led to the Environmental Technical Assistance Project noted
earlier, which assists NEPA in its efforts to find more efficient regulatory methods,
improve staff capabilities, and bolster environmental monitoring.  That project
complements Bank-administered, Japanese Government-fmanced technical assistance to
NEPA covering (a) the environmental impact assessment process; (b) waste minimization
and pollution control in rural industries; (c) hazardous/toxic waste management;
(d) economic/financial   mechanisms   for   environmental   management;  and
(e) environmental information management systems. The Global Environmental Facility
has supported studies and projects on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the loss
of biodiversity in China, and ozone-depleting substances.
1.17 We are currently supporting six urban environmental projects in 12 cities, which
incorporate policy, financing and organizational strategies for improved environmental
regulation and service delivery at the provincial and municipal levels, in addition to
national regulatory assistance. Another five ongoing investment projects in another 12
cities include related issues such as municipal water supply and sanitation. The initial
portfolio of projects focused on China's largest cities-Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin-
and those located primarily in the wealthier northeast and coastal provinces.
Enviromnental pressures remain high in those areas and cooperation would continue, as



-6-
with the Second Shanghai Sewerage Project (Loan 3987-CHA) and the proposed project.
However, the Hubei Urban Environmental Project (Loan 3966/Credit 2799-CHA) and the
recently approved Yunnan Environment Project (Loan 4055/Credit 2892-CHA) mark a
shift in geographic focus, moving toward inland and poorer areas. Hubei, a medium-
income province, is located in central China, while operations in poor areas, like Yunnan,
and others being prepared in Guangxi, Hebei and Sichuan Provinces and in Chongqing
Municipality, would further test the sustainability of policy and institutional
interventions.
1.18 A review of ongoing Bank Group projects in the sector in China and elsewhere
presents relevant lessons in the provision and management of urban environmental
services and in industrial pollution control.
1.19 Bankwide municipal management sector work (Urban Sector Delivery: Finding
the Right Incentives) emphasizes the need to assign functional responsibilities
appropriately and link revenue to expenditures. In China's case, environmental services
are fittingly provided at the municipal level, where a high percentage of government
revenue is also captured. China: Urban Environmental Service Management concludes
that the major failing in environmental services has been dependence on municipal
budget transfers to fund services, while greater reliance on user charges would be
affordable, induce resource conservation, and create a more dependable income stream.
Similarly, the Operation and Evaluation Department's review of Bank-financed water and
sanitation projects (Water Supply and Sanitation Projects: The Bank Experience 1967-
1989) found generally good physical performance but less successful financial viability
and overall sectoral development. For that reason, ensuring adequate levels of tariff was
a focus of the policy dialogue during project preparation, with the result that water
supply, wastewater and district heating tariffs were adjusted prior to project preappraisal
and appraisal. This openness to introducing improvements was seen during preparation
of the Urban Environmental Service Study, for which cities in Hubei and Yunnan were
used as case studies.
1.20  The Bank's experience in industrial pollution control includes projects in China,
as well as in Mexico, Brazil, India, Indonesia and the Russian Federation. A review of
completed projects (Industry and Environment: Pattern in World Bank Lending)
emphasizes the need for political commitment, clear standards and regulations, incentives
to comply, and institutional capability to monitor and enforce standards. When industrial
pollution abatement subloans are involved, the following conditions increase likelihood
of success: a profitable and growing industrial sector, flexibility in choice of technology,
availability of funds at close-to-market terms, and targeting on sources that can yield
significant improvement in the ambient environment.
1.21  The environmental pollution control component of the proposed project draws on
these lessons and those in the two recent environmental sector studies. The latter stress
issues of political commitment, appropriate standards and incentives, and institutional
monitoring and enforcement capabilities.  This project addresses those issues by
improving the monitoring and enforcement capacities of Shandong's provincial and



-7 -
municipal EPBs by aiming to provide training, institutional development and equipment.
Competent enforcement of regulations would be enhanced by requiring the Shandong
Environmental Protection Bureau (SEPB) to enhance the collection of pollution levies in
Shandong.
1.22  Consequently, the proposed project responds to Bank Group experience and CAS
objectives for the environment and infrastructure development.  Environmental
amelioration would be enhanced by an improved regulatory environment, protection of
critical water and land resources, and reduction of current pollution loads. Infrastructure
expansion would benefit from investment in wastewater and solid waste collection and
treatment as well as in water supply expansion, commercialization of operating agencies,
an improved tariff policy to fund maintenance of the existing systems as well as their
future expansion, and modem operating techniques. The Bank Group's strategy flows
from and supports China's Environmental Action Plan and Agenda 21 initiatives, which
provide the basis for joint Government and Bank action in the environmental sector,
especially in regard to the urban environment. The provincial focus recognizes the
effective decentralization of regulatory and investment authority in China, and draws on
local political power and commitment to induce wider use of the solutions to be
demonstrated under the project.

2. THE PROJECT AREA
A. ECONOMIC SETTING
2.1   Shandong is a coastal province in eastern China with a land area of 156,700 km2,
including a large peninsula. It has a 3,000 km coastline on the Bohai and Yellow Seas
and shares borders with Hebei, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces. There are eight
main lakes and nine rivers within the province. The major river is the Huang He (Yellow
River), which in the western part of the province forms the border with Hebei.
2.2   The 1995 population of the province was reported at 87 million, of which the
urban population accounted for about 32 percent. Overall population growth was
reported at 0.38 percent per year; the nonagricultural population had grown quickly in the
past 20 years, from 5.6 million in 1975 to 21.7 million in 1995. In contrast, the
agricultural population during the same period had remained about the same, 64.0 million
in 1975 and 65.3 million in 1995. However, these data do not capture the large influx of
migrants who have not gained official urban status, nor do they reflect the dynamic
growth of small towns. With Shandong's rapid industrial and service sector growth,
urbanization is expected to continue at a high rate through the next decade and beyond.
2.3   The economy of the province has grown rapidly over the past decade. In 1995,
the gross domestic product (GDP) was Y 500 billion, with an average annual growth rate
of about 16.7 percent from 1990 to 1995. Of the total GDP, Y 101 billion was generated
by the primary sector, Y 237 billion by the secondary and Y 162 billion from the tertiary
sector. The proportion of GDP generated by the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors
has changed substantially, from 35:43:22 in 1985 to 20:48:32 in 1995. This indicates
that, although all three sectors showed robust growth during the last 10 years, growth was
most rapid in the tertiary sector and slowest in agriculture.
2.4   The rapid growth of the industrial and service sectors has resulted in serious
environmental problems in urban areas, particularly in Jinan, the capital city, and in the
coastal cities of Qingdao, Weihai and Yantai, and in Zibo. Because of Shandong's (and
China's) vast coal deposits and paucity of natural gas and oil, almost all thermal power
generation, industrial process heat, and residential heating utilize coal as the major energy
source. Were the coal burned efficiently and economically in large boilers equipped with
pollution control equipment (with which efficiency reaches acceptable levels above 85
percent), air pollution would not be as severe as it is. Shandong, however, has the largest
mass emissions of SO2 of all the provinces of China; air quality in all major cities is poor,
particularly during the heating season; and the provincial capital, Jinan, ranked twenty-
second in 1995 in the NEPA list of 37 "most environmentally stressed cities in China."
Some rivers have become merely wastewater canals since the late 1980s. For example,



-9-
water in the Xiaoqing River fails to meet the least stringent Class V national ambient
water quality standards over its entire length. The pollution in the Xiaoqing River Basin
(XRB) has posed serious threats to human health, as well as to economic development.
Contaminants in groundwater have made drinking water unsafe, requiring the province to
finance the construction of 237 deep wells and 11 water storage reservoirs near the river.
2.5  Investment in industrial pollution control in Shandong amounted to Y 2.1 billion
in 1995, ranking the province in second place (after Liaoning) among the 27 provinces in
China. More than 50 percent of the investments were in wastewater treatment and
pollution control.
B. THE PROJECT AREAS
2.6   The cities and their rural hinterlands selected to benefit from the proposed
investments exemplify the development successes and environmental problems in
Shandong (see AnnexJ1); their location is shown on Map IBRD 28428.
Jinan
2.7   Jinan Municipality comprises an area of 8,227 km2 and has a population of 5.4
million. It consists of five urban districts, four counties, and one county-level city. Jinan
City has an area of 2,119 km2 and a population of 2.5 million. The core area of the city is
110 km2, with a population of 1.5 million. The Xiaoqing River rises in Jinan, fed by
springs and from infiltration from the nearby Yellow River; it is a prime water source for
Jinan Municipality, ultimately flowing into Laizhou Bay, some 237 km east of the city.
The river has nine tributaries and outfalls in the Jinan area, and six catchment systems in
all. It passes through 18 cities and counties, including Jinan, Zibo, Binzhou Prefecture,
Dongying and Weifang. Up to the 1960s, the river's waters were clean; however, the
rapid industrial development has led to severe contamination.
2.8   Water Supply System.  The Jinan Water Supply Company (JWSC) was
established in 1936 to provide a supply of about 7,600 m3/day at that time, through 40 km
of pipe network for about 1,700 residential and industrial units in the commercial area of
the city. The system has been progressively extended, with the present installed design
capacity reported around 895,000 m3/day, although the actual available supply is
restricted to some 714,000 m3/day due to resource constraints. The existing water
distribution network now covers an area of some 364 km2 and extends to about 1,150 km.
2.9   Groundwater has traditionally been the main water resource for the city.
However, this resource has been progressively supplemented in recent years by supplies
from impounding reservoirs and direct abstractions from the Yellow River in order to
control the "mining" of groundwater caused by overabstraction of this resource.
2.10 Water Demand. The water demand projections through the planning horizon of
2010 have been estimated based on the following broad assumptions: population served;
industrial output value; and other uses (including public facilities, fire fighting and



-10-
system losses). Other water uses are expected to reduce from 18 percent (actual in 1995)
to 16 percent in 2000 and 15 percent by 2010, reflecting improved system operational
efficiency and reduced system losses. The water demand and resource projections
indicate a supply deficit of 0.25 million m3/day in 1995, increasing to about 0.86 million
m3/day in the year 2000, based on per capita demands varying in the range of 190 to 300
liters per capita per day (l/c/d) over the planning period to 2010 (details in Annex 2).
2.11  Water Resource Planning. In order to address the apparent deficit in supply,
JWSC has identified the main system deficiencies and has developed a long-term
resource strategy. The deficiencies and problems include: insufficient surface water;
"mining" of groundwater; low reliability of Yellow River source without storage;
equipment defects at Huanghe No. 1 Water Treatment Plant (WTP); low system pressures
in certain areas; old pipe networks; and water wastage. The development plan is based on
least-cost resource analysis.
2.12 Under this project, the Queshan Reservoir Yellow River abstraction scheme
would be implemented. This would provide a continuous supply of 440,000 m3/day of
desilted raw water to fully utilize the existing treatment capacity at the Huanghe No. 2
WTP, thus providing a supply of 400,000 m3/day of fully treated water to the city.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that JWSC would, not later than
December 31, 2000, strengthen its distribution systems to handle an increased supply of
about 400,000 m3/day offiully treated water to Jinan.
2.13  Wastewater System. The total amount of wastewater discharged in Jinan was
204.6 million tons in 1995, of which 117.2 million tons were from industrial sources.
Only 53 percent of industrial wastewater met the effluent standards for all pollutants.
Common problems of unreliable technology and poor operation of the end-of-pipe
treatment facilities is one of the important reasons for the low compliance rate with
effluent standards, the majority of wastewater flows in open channels untreated to the
surface and groundwater systems, causing extensive long-term environmental damage
and posing immediate-term health hazards. A Sewerage Master plan was originally
prepared in 1983; this was updated in 1993 and provides the basis for the sewerage
planning for the city. The urban area of Jinan is divided into seven catchments
comprising Jiqi, Jiluo, Daming Lake, Liuhangtou, Huangtai Qili River, Wangsheren and
Danjia catchments totaling about 140 km2 in area.
2.14 The existing sewer system comprises about 145 km of pipes in the catchments of
Jiluo, Daming, Liuhangtou and Huangtai, in sizes between 300 and 1,500 mm diameter,
mostly of concrete pipe construction, with small lengths of brick culverts and pipes.
There are a number of pump stations, the most significant of which is the Juluo Bridge
station, built in 1985, of 230,000 m3/day capacity, to lift sewage to the Jilan Sewage
Treatment Works (STW), which has a capacity of 220,000 m3/day; a second STW would
be required in due course as flows increase to reflect improved interception and
connection rates, and economic growth. The STW, which was financed in part with
bilateral aid, and completed in 1995, is presently underutilized pending the construction



- 11 -
of new interceptor sewers to convey flows to the STW. An understanding was obtained
during negotiations that Shandong Province (SP) would cause the Jinan Municipal
Drainage Company (JMDC) to commission and continuously operate the STW in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank, on completion of the water management component of
the project.
2.15  The present wastewater flow from all seven catchments in the city is about
680,000 m3/day, comprising about 30 percent domestic and 70 percent industrial flows.
The existing sewerage system is partly combined and partly separate, and is seriously
inadequate, with large parts of the 145 km of main and secondary sewers not functioning
satisfactorily due to siltation and blocking of the inverted siphons at river crossings. All
wastewater flows discharge directly or indirectly into watercourses within the city or to
the Xiaoqing River through existing sewers.  As a result, the water quality in
watercourses and lakes within the city and the Xiaoqing River has deteriorated to below
National Surface Water Class V Standard.
2.16  The Jinan STW  is designed to provide full secondary treatment and sludge
disposal facilities, to deal with wastewater flows from the catchments of Jiluo, Daming
Lake, Liuhangtou and Huangtai, totaling 0.44 million m3/day in 1995. The projected
wastewater flows from the above four catchments are estimated at about 0.58 million m3!
day by 2010.
2.17  Major system requirements are for investrnents to fully utilize the existing
capacity of the Jinan STW; improve the watercourses and natural environment in the city;
protect groundwater resources from pollution; reduce pollution of the Daming Lake; and
improve water quality of the Xiaoqing River. The second phase of this STW would be
built during 2001-15; meanwhile, excess flows would continue to spill over into the
Xiaoqing River (further details are shown in Annex 2).
Weihai
2.18 Weihai Municipality, located at the eastern end of the Shandong Peninsula,
comprises an area of 731 km2 and a population of 2.43 million (with a 0.67 million
nonagricultural population). Weihai City, one of the largest fishery bases in China, is
bordered by the sea on three sides and covers an area of 38.6 km2. Weihai City runs in a
north-to-south direction for about 25 km, and is about 5 km wide. The population of
Weihai city is 174,000. Weihai is noted for its beautiful scenery and equable climate.
However, in recent years, economic development and an expanding urban population has
resulted in increased atmospheric pollution. As a result of increased coal consumption,
mainly in small inefficient boilers and stoves, the annual average SO2 has increased from
0.015 mg/m3 in 1991 to 0.021 mg/m3 in 1994, an annual increase of 11.9 percent, giving
rise to potentially serious environmental health concerns.
2.19 District Heating. Weihai has three thermal power plants that supply heat and
electricity. No. 1 Thermal Power Plant was constructed in 1958 with 2x20 tons/hour
steam boilers and 1.5 megawatt (MW) generator. As a result of the city's development,



- 12-
the site of this plant now is highly valuable land in the city center, and it is proposed to
demolish the plant. A new plant is required south of the city center in an industrial zone.
Some of the steam load of the present industry (40 tons/hour) served by No. 1 and No. 2
plants can also be supplied from the plant in the south, thus allowing substantial heating
capacity from these plants for residential district heating in the city center.
Yantai
2.20 Yantai Municipality, located in the northeastern part of the Shandong Peninsula
between Bo Sea and Yellow Sea, has an area of 13,745 km2 and a population of 6.35
million in 1995. Yantai is an important seaport and tourist area in the province. It
consists of four urban districts, two counties, and six county-level city. Yantai City has
an area of 2,643 km2 and a population of 1.5 million. Yantai's climate is characterized by
high rainfall and humid air. Compared to the inland area, Yantai has a relatively small
temperature difference between winter and summer, and between day and night.
2.21  District Heating. The rapid industrial growth has caused an increase in the
amount of coal consumption, with associated worsening of air quality. Many small
inefficient boilers are now in use, which provide heat to residential and other units during
the heating season. The maximum daily average concentration of SO2 and annual
average value of S02 were 0.57 (3.85 times the standards) and 0.114 mg/m3 (1.9 times the
standards), respectively, and levels of TSP also greatly exceed the standards. Increasing
levels of nitrogen oxide (NO,) are reported, resulting from an increase in the number of
urban automobiles as well as from the industrial growth. The main heat supply to a new
network to be constructed under the project would come from an existing power plant
owned partly by Yantai Municipality. The power plant is installing two 100 MW
(electrical) extraction-condensing turbines that would supply some 270 MW of heat.
2.22 Weihai and Yantai Municipalities have proposed to implement pilot programs to
test energy conservation through the introduction of two-pipe heating systems in new
buildings. This would allow individual household metering with thermostatic control of
radiators, leading to consumption-based pricing, as now practiced with electricity, water
and wastewater. During negotiations, understandings were obtained from SP that Weihai
and Yantai Municipalities would introduce two-pipe heating systems on a pilot basis in
new buildings to test the potential of energy conservation through individual household
metering and room temperature control of radiators.
C. THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT'S ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGY
2.23 Recognizing the problems described above, the Shandong Provincial Government
(SPG) issued three legal documents in mid-1990s to reverse the deterioration of the
province's environmental quality and initiated various actions aimed at achieving this
goal. They are: (a) A Decision on Strengthening Water Pollution Prevention and Control
(No. 31, 1996); (b) A Notice on the Establishment of a Special Fund for Controlling
Pollution Generated From Pulp and Paper Enterprises, Breweries, and Distilleries, issued
on March 7, 1996; and (c) Measures for Collecting the Urban Wastewater Treatment Fee



- 13 -
in Shandong Province. SPG is also implementing existing national environmental
programs.
2.24 The first document-A Decision on Strengthening Water Pollution Prevention
and Control (No. 31, 1996)-sets a timetable for wastewater discharge control. It
stipulates that by the end of 1997, wastewater discharged from key industrial pollution
sources located in the XRB should meet the national effluent standards. By the end of the
year 2000, all industrial pollution sources in Shandong Province should meet national
effluent standards.
2.25  The second document-A Notice on the Establishment of a Special Fund for
Controlling Pollution Generated From Pulp and Paper Enterprises, Breweries, and
Distilleries-was issued on March 7, 1996, to accelerate the control of water pollution
generated from these most polluting industries. The document requires enterprises
producing pulp and paper and alcoholic beverages to contribute to a special fund as long
as the concentration of pollutants in their wastewater exceeds the national standards. The
contribution of enterprises to the fund is based on annual production output: Y 100 per
ton of pulp: Y 50 per ton of alcohol, and Y 20 per ton of beer.
2.26 The third document-Measures for Collecting the Urban Wastewater Treatment
Fee in Shandong Province-is designed to ease the problem of capital shortages for
construction and to cover the maintenance and operating cost of centralized wastewater
treatment plants. The provincial government issued Provisional measures, mandating the
collection of urban wastewater treatment fees from working units and individuals located
within the service area of centralized treatment plants. The rate of fee would not exceed
30 percent of the current price of tap water.
2.27 To stop the continual decline in air quality and to achieve the goal of meeting
Class II ambient air quality standards in main cities in Shandong by the year 2000, SPG
considers the control of air pollution caused by coal combustion as the main task in the
next 15 years. The six main target cities include Jinan, Qingdao, Zibo, Taian, Weihai and
Yantai. The province plans to increase both the existing area of gas supply and the
existing area of district heating by 10 percent by 2000, and by 30 percent by 2010. The
province also plans to raise the coverage ratio of soot control area to 85 percent by 2000
and to 100 percent by 2010. In addition, controlling air pollution caused by the quick
increase in the number of automobiles in urban areas is considered another task in the
next decade.
2.28  In response to the serious pollution problems in the XRB, the Shandong People's
Congress issued the Shandong Xiaoqing River Basin Water Pollution Prevention and
Control Regulation (the Regulation) in 1995. There are several articles in the Regulation
that are not covered by existing national laws, regulations, or programs. The Regulation
is more advanced in several aspects than the existing national environmental programs. It
reflects the three changes in the approach to industrial pollution prevention and control
addressed by the Second National Conference on Control and Prevention Of Industrial



- 14-
Pollution in 1993: first, employ cleaner production instead of end-of-pipe treatment;
second, move from concentration-based discharge standards to a dual system (combining
concentration-based and mass-based discharge standard); and third, switch from sole
reliance on on-site treatment facilities at industrial enterprises to a combination of
centralized treatment facilities and on-site treatment facilities.
2.29 A Xiaoqing River Comprehensive Pollution Prevention and Control Plan of 1994
(the Plan) was approved by the Shandong People's Congress in 1995. The Plan initiates
six main actions for controlling Xiaoqing River pollution: First, the province prepared
and began to control 100 serious industrial polluting sources by 1997 (Y 70 million has
already been invested). The total investment in point-source control (including the
control of the 100 serious industrial pollution sources) is about Y 859 million. Second, to
built 11 centralized wastewater treatment plants (with a total capacity of 725,000 tons/
day) in the river basin by 2000. The estimated total investment is some Y 1.4 billion.
Two municipal treatment plants have already been built-one in Jinan, the other in Zibo.
Third, the province plans to invest Y 7.8 million to control nonpoint-source pollution in
the XRB. Fourth, the province is preparing to undertake major river training works
(including dredging silt) on the Xiaoqing River, with a investment estimated at Y 2.5
billion. Fifth, the province would continuously invest in solving drinking water problems
caused by groundwater pollution. Sixth, a Yellow River Water Diversion Project is
planned by the province to divert water from the Yellow River to the Xiaoqing River to
sustain higher levels of flow and thereby reduce the concentration of pollutants in that
river by simple dilution. A survey of the principal point sources of pollution in the XRB
has shown that some 90 percent is produced by the top 44 polluters-of these, the top
three account for an estimated 50 percent of total chemical oxygen demand (COD) and
toxic discharges. Time-bound Environmental Action Plans have been prepared by
Shandong to address these problems.
D. FORMULATION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
2.30 Environmental Policy in Shandong. The provincial government considers that
the environmental degradation in Shandong is "serious," due mainly to rapid industrial
growth as result of the transition to a market economy, aggravated by historic mistakes,
the use of "backward technology" and a shortage of funds.  To combat further
environmental deterioration, the province and the three cities that would be included in
this project have identified environmental policies and programs that are aimed at
substantially reducing their main pollution problems by the year 2000. These efforts
would permit economic growth while aiming to markedly reduce industrial pollution,
improve municipal environmental treatment measures and provide ecological protection.
Particular mention is made in these plans to regional watershed protection as well as
environmental management. Main emphasis would be given to three areas that are most
environmentally stressed: the area around Lake Weishan in the south, the industrial
heartland area of the XRB in the central part of the province and northeastern peninsula
area on the coast. XRB has been identified by the State Council of the national
government as one of the most polluted minor river basins in China, and selected as a



- 15 -
priority candidate for managed cleanup. The XRB and the peninsula are the two areas of
geographical focus of this project.
2.31  Bank Group Assistance Strategy and Rationale for Bank Group Involvement
in the Project.   The China Country Assistance Strategy highlights enhancing
environmental protection and reducing infrastructure bottlenecks as two of the five areas of
strategic focus. This project specifically responds to these two foci, improving highly
polluted and deteriorating water resources and providing for their subsequent protection,
facilitating more stringent environmental regulation, and reducing current pollution loads.
It would also provide urban environmental infrastructure for wastewater, water supply and
industrial waste reduction, backed up by a strengthened urban services tariff policy aiming
to sustain infrastructure investments and improve asset management and operations.
2.32 The project follows from previous Bank Group-assisted urban environmental
management projects and furthers a recently adopted strategy initiated with a similar
project in Hubei of moving from the wealthier provinces to less wealthy areas. With
these projects, the Bank Group is facilitating broader national debate on strategies for
urban environmental improvement focusing on sustainable financing mechanisms,
rational and workable local-level institutional utility management arrangements and least-
cost long-life public utility investment programs to meet urban development service
needs in an affordable manner. The project would, in addition, build on our institutional
relationships with groups such as NEPA, the Ministry of Construction, and the Chinese
Mayors Association.
2.33  Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Group Assistance. Important lessons
have been learned in three areas of concern to the present project: provision and
management of urban environmental services; pollution control; and project preparation
and implementation.  With respect to the provision and management of urban
environmental services, Bank municipal management sector work ("Urban Service
Delivery; Finding the Right Incentives") emphasizes the need to properly assign
functional responsibilities and line revenue to expenditures. In China's case,
environmental services are appropriately provided at the municipal level, where a high
percentage of government revenue is also captured. Recent sector work ("China: Urban
Environmental Service Management," Report 13073-CHA) concludes that the major
failing in environmental services has been dependence on municipal budget transfer to
fund services, while greater reliance on user charges would be affordable, induce resource
conservation, and create a more dependable income stream. For that reason, increasing
tariffs has been a major focal point of the policy dialogue in this project. This responds,
too, to a major finding in the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) review of Bank
water and sanitation projects ("Water Supply and Sanitation Projects; The Bank
Experience 1967-1989"), wherein physical performance was generally good, but
sustaining financial viability and overall sectoral development was less successful.
2.34  In matters of pollution control, the Bank's experience draws on recent projects in
China, as well as in Mexico, Brazil, India, Indonesia and the Russian Federation. A

review of Bank experience ("Industry and Environment: Patterns in World Bank
Lending") emphasizes the need for political commitment, clear standards and regulations,
incentives to comply, and institutional capability to monitor and enforce standards.
When industrial pollution abatement subloans are involved, the following conditions
increase likelihood of success: a profitable and growing industrial sector, flexibility in
choice of technology, availability of funds at close-to-market terms, and targeting sources
that can yield significant improvement in the ambient environment. The pollution
abatement components draw on these lessons and those in two recent sector studies, as
well as the recently completed four short-term environmental priority studies undertaken
during the preparation of this project. The latter stress issues of political commitment,
appropriate standards and incentives, and institutional monitoring and enforcement
capabilities.  This project addresses those issues through action plans seeking to
maximize project impact beyond the direct benefits of the investments, while
strengthening the provincial and municipal EPBs.
2.35  With respect to project preparation and implementation, Shandong Province is
one of the more experienced recipients of Bank assistance. Over the past 15 years, the
province has participated in 27 Bank-assisted projects, with the highest-rated project
performance record. It should, therefore, serve as a good test for the Bank's initiative to
place more responsibility on member governments for project preparation and shorten the
time of project preparation. However, the responsibility for preparing this project has
been with sector agencies with no experience of Bank approaches to project formulation;
this delayed preparation.  The inexperience precipitated the use of supplementary
consultant funds to enhance quality at entry; and necessitated inclusion in the project of
institutional strengthening, project management and training components, which initially
Shandong considered nonessential.

3. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.1   The project is part of a phased development program of Shandong Province (SP)
to improve environmental conditions and sustain urban services management. The
principal objective of the project is to support government efforts to put in place a
sustainable environmental framework for the long-term economic and social development
of the Province, while supporting a conducive foundation for industrial growth. Specific
objectives of the project are to: (a) strengthen policies, regulations and institutional
arrangements for municipal water, wastewater, and district heating, and environmental
pollution prevention and control; (b) expand surface water supply to Jinan to prevent
fiurther depletion of groundwater aquifers; (c) facilitate sustainable management of
investments in pollution control and municipally-provided urban environmental services;
and (d) arrange for updating the information database with respect to water quality and
management in XRB.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.2   The project would comprise a blend of policy and investment initiatives. The
policy initiatives would support a stronger market orientation for municipal service
financial management, and environmental management of polluting industrial enterprises.
Investments would support municipal strategies for environmental recovery and sustained
use of natural water resources. A detailed description is given in Annex 2. A summary
description of the five core project components is given below. The costs shown include
physical and price contingencies.
(a)   Jinan Municipality
Water Supply Management. Investments in Jinan for surface-water
storage, pumping, transmission and distribution facilities to augment and
improve the long-term reliability of the water supply system of the city
and protect groundwater resources.
$62.6 million
Wastewater Management. Investments in wastewater collection and
pumping systems in Jinan for the protection of Xiaoqing River water
quality and full utilization of existing treatment facilities.
$36.5 million

facility to assist selected heavily polluting small- and medium-size
enterprises in the XRB to carry out high environmental benefit and cost-
effective investments for pollution abatement including waste
minimization in order to comply with environmental regulations.
$10.0 million
(e)   Institutional Strengthening and Training. Investments to support and
strengthen provincial, municipal, project and financial management;
construction supervision services; training in sector and utility operations;
updating of the Xiaoqing River Basin water quality and management
database.
$3.9 million
Total Estimated Project Cost    $202.0 million
3.3   The financial, urban environment service delivery and utility management policy
initiatives would concentrate on (a) operational efficiency improvements; (b) resource
mobilization and cost recovery measures; (c) underpinning of long-term financial and
economic sustainability; and (d) environmental pollution reduction through focused time-
bound Action Plans with respect to pollution from paper and chemical industries. The
institutional strengthening and training component would enhance policies and
operational experience in environmental protection and water, wastewater, and district
heating management. Support for these initiatives has been grouped into a number of
packages for the various executing agencies, covering management and agency
strengthening, financial management improvement, construction supervision and training.
3.4   SP has prepared and updated a strategy for implementing the Institutional
Strengthening and Training component according to an agreed schedule. The signing of
contracts with consulting firms for institutional strengthening, financial management

improvement, and construction supervision is a condition of disbursement of the civil
works category of the project (para. 3.24). During negotiations, an assurance was
obtained that SP would implement the Institutional Strengthening and Training
component in accordance with a schedule acceptable to the Bank, and discuss and agree
any revisions to the schedule with the Bank
C. PROJECT MONITORING

is included in Annex 9. Operational and financial monitoring indicators for the water,
wastewater and district heating entities are discussed subsequently (paras. 5.20 and 5.25)
and included in Annex 14. The format and content of project progress reports and project
impact monitoring indicators and methodology would be discussed and confirmed during
negotiations. Parameters, baseline and targeted values would be developed by the
Shandong Provincial Project Management Office (SPPMO) (para. 4.1) and the relevant
participating agencies for review during the proposed Project Launch Workshop (see
para. 3.40).
D. PROJECT COST ESTIMATES
3.7       The estimated  cost of the project including  contingencies is Y  1,834.0  million
($202.0 million). The foreign exchange component is Y 543.4 million ($59.8 million), or

commitment charges.
3.8      Base  cost estimates  reflect preliminary  engineering  designs  and  price  levels
expected prevailing in December 1996. The unit prices were derived from the following
sources: (a) quotations obtained from manufacturers and suppliers; (b) prices of goods
and works from recent contracts; and (c) construction costs according to prices published
by  the  Central  and  Shandong  Governments,  all adjusted  for  inflation.    Physical
contingencies of 10 percent have been applied to base costs for all components, apart
from the Jinan Wastewater Component where 15 percent has been applied. None has
been applied to the Xiaoqing River Basin Control Subloans Facility (XRBSL).
Construction Supervision Services costs estimated at 2.2 percent of the civil works and 1
percent of the materials and equipment costs of the water, wastewater and district heating
components, have been included in the project cost estimates. Project management and
engineering overhead costs of 10 percent are also included.

3.9   Price contingencies have been applied to expenditures at projected global foreign
and local inflation rates. In view of the large variation between foreign and local price
contingency projections, the dollar/yuan exchange rate has been assumed to vary in order
to maintain purchasing power parity. The inflation rate projections used are as follows:

3.11   The Government of China and the Shandong Provincial Government have
selected LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loan terms for the project in order to
facilitate management of the foreign exchange risk of their borrowings by more closely
matching the currency of their liabilities with that of their net trade flows, about 50
percent of which are US dollar-denominated. The LIBOR-based product was selected in
order to preserve the full maturity of the loan, compared to the fixed-rate option that
would have resulted in a 15-year loan. The Borrower judges that it can manage any
interest rate risk.
3.12 The IBRD loan would be made to the Government of China. The loan of $95
million would be for a 20-year term, including a 5-year grace period at the standard
interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans. The proceeds of the loan
would be made available through SP to the municipalities on the following terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank: at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US
dollar single currency loans plus a spread of 0.5 percent per year, for 17 years including a
5-year grace period, and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per year. SP, and then the
municipalities, would bear the foreign exchange risks. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations from SP that it would cause Jinan, Weihai and Yantai Municipalities to
relend the loan proceeds onlent to them to their water, wastewater and district heating
utility companies on the following terms: at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based



- 22 -
US dollar single currency loans plus a spread of 1. 0 percent per year, with the entities
bearing the commitment charges and the foreign exchange risks; the maturity would be
for 15 years, including a 5-year period of grace.
3.13  Execution of subsidiary loan agreements between the project municipalities and
their water, wastewater and district heating utility companies, satisfactory to the Bank, is a
condition of effectiveness. A separate Project Agreement, including operational, financial
and monitoring covenants, would be executed between SP and the Bank.
3.14 About $5.0 million equivalent of loan proceeds would be onlent by SP from a
revolving credit facility (Xiaoqing River Basin Subloans Facility-XRBSL) to help finance
goods and equipment for pollution reduction investments of small- and medium-size
enterprises located in the XRB area. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that SP
would onlend to participating enterprises at the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based
US dollar single currency loans plus a spread of not less than 1.5 percent per year, with
the enterprises bearing a commitment charge of 0. 75 percent and the foreign exchange risk
The maturity would not exceed five years, including a one- to two-year period of grace.
Subloan repayments would be recycled for additional pollution control subprojects to the
extent not needed to repay the loan to China SP also gave its assurance that it would
allocate to the account of XRBSL a total of about Y41.5 million over the three fiscal years
commencing 1997, depositing the following amounts to its account by June 30, 1997, 1998
and 1999: Y16.5 million, Y12.5 million and Y12.5 million,
F. PROCUREMENT
3.15  Procurement procedures and arrangements satisfactory to the Bank were agreed
upon with Shandong Province. All procurement would be undertaken in accordance with
the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, January 1995 and revised in January and August
1996.  Activities would be organized through the China Machinery Corporation
International Tendering Company (CMCITC), the China Technology Import and Export
Corporation International Tendering Company (CITC), and Shandong Machinery and
Electrical Equipment Tendering Company (SMET) of the China Machinery and
Electrical Equipment Center, which would be contracted by SPPMO on behalf of the
implementing agencies and SP to carry out the work. CMCITC, CITC and SMET are
experienced and competent procurement agents familiar with, and have had recent and
relevant experience in, international competitive bidding (ICB) work on Bank-financed
projects. The tender documents to be used in the project would be based on the current
version of model bidding documents agreed between the World Bank Group and the
Government. All works contracts would be grouped whenever practical into bid
packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $6 million or more each, and contracts for
goods shall be grouped into packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $250,000 or
more each, to attract maximum international competition. For all contracts estimated to
cost $10 million or more, invitations for bids would be advertised as Special Procurement
Notices published in Development Business and/or well-known technical magazines,
newspapers and trade publications of wide international circulation. Annex 4a lists the

Note:  Figures in parenthesis are amounts to be financed by the Bank.
3.16 Civil Works. Excluding the Xiaoqing River Basin Subloans Facility, there is a
total of about $77.1 million of civil works, of which about $29.4 million (38 percent) would
be procured using ICB procedures. Qualified domestic contractors under ICB would be
eligible for a 7.5 percent preference in bid evaluation, in accordance with the Guidelines.
ICB procedures would be used for all civil works contracts of estimated value over $6.0
million (i.e., two contracts). All remaining civil works are too small, scattered or scheduled
too far apart to be packaged to be of interest to foreign finms. Of the remaining works,
about $45.6 million would be awarded through national competitive bidding (NCB)
procedures, acceptable to the Bank. The NCB procedures recently adopted by the
Government have been reviewed and approved by the World Bank Group. Interested
foreign bidders would be allowed to bid for NCB contracts.
3.17 Equipment and Materials. Excluding the Xiaoqing River Basin Subloans Facility,
there is a total of about $66.5 million of equipment and materials in the project, of which
about $61.2 million (92 percent) would be procured using ICB procedures. Qualified
domestic bidders would be eligible for a preference in bid evaluation of 15 percent of the



- 24 -
cost, insurance and freight (CIF) price or customs duties and import tax payable by a
nonexempt importer, whichever is less. All equipment and materials with individual
contract values of $250,000 or more equivalent would be procured using ICB procedures.
Equipment and materials with individual contract values less than $250,000 equivalent
would be awarded using NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank, up to an aggregate
amount of $1.5 million. Contracts costing $50,000 equivalent or less up to an aggregate
amount of about $1.0 million, would be procured through shopping procedures (national
and international) with at least three price quotations.
3.18 Direct Contracting. Direct contracting (not Bank-financed), amounting to about
$4.9 million, would be used for: (a) contracts to be made with the local power companies to
provide electricity supplies to the pump stations, buildings and facilities under the project;
(b) drainage and road diversions; and (c) other utility services.
3.19 Environmental Pollution Prevention and Control. Under this component,
which would be operated by the Shandong Environmental Protection Bureau (SEPB) in
collaboration with the Shandong Finance Bureau (SFB), subloans of up to $500,000
would be supported. Contracts for equipment and materials financed through subloans up
to a facility total of $10.0 million would be awarded, after solicitation and evaluation
through national shopping procedures with at least three written price quotations from
eligible suppliers (see Annex 12 for details of XRBSL operations). This is consistent with
procedures that the Bank Group has reviewed and found satisfactory. These contracts
would be subject to post review by the Bank, and SPPMO would maintain all relevant
documents in its records for this purpose.
3.20 Technical Assistance and Training. All consultants to be retained under the
project would be recruited in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines for Selection
and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers-January 1997." For contracts
estimated to cost less than $200,000 equivalent, SP may engage national consultants, using
Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS) procedures. For contracts estimated to cost less
than $100,000 equivalent, SP may, with the Bank's prior agreement, single-source selection
of consultants. Counterpart staff would be engaged or assigned by the concerned agencies
of SP. Consultants would be engaged using the Bank's Standard Form of Contract for
Consultants' Services-June 1995. Drafts of Letters of Invitation and Terms of Reference

Weihai Botong Heat and Power Company Ltd. (WBHPC) and Yantai Heat Supply
Company Ltd. (YHSC); and (b) Package B-construction supervision -for JWSC, JMDC,
WBHPC and YHSC, and support for SPPMO were reviewed at negotiations. Details of the
institutional strengthening and training component are set out in Annex 2. The signing of
contracts between SP and consultingfirms for such assistance under Packages A and B is a
condition of disbursement of the civil works category. The Terms of Reference for the
above consultancy assignments are in the Project File (Annex 16).



- 25 -
3.21   Review of Bid Documents and Contracts. All civil works packages (about nine
contracts, 79 percent of the works) of $2.5 million or more, and all equipment and materials
contracts (about 12 contracts, 95 percent of the equipment and materials) of $0.5 million or
more would be subject to the Bank's normal prior review, including prequalification, notice
of invitation to bid, bid documents, bid evaluation and contracts. The threshold for prior
review of contracts for consultants would be $100,000 equivalent for firms and $50,000 for
individual contracts, including the approval of budgets, short lists, selection procedures,
letters of invitation, proposal evaluation reports and contracts. Other contracts would be
subject to selective postaward review, covering at least 25 percent of these contracts. An
estimated 88 percent of the value of all contracts proposed to be financed by the Bank
would be subject to prior review. However, all terms of reference for consultants contracts,
any single-source selection of consultants, assignments the Bank considers to be of a critical
nature, and any amendments to contracts that result in the contract exceeding the above-
mentioned two thresholds would require Bank prior review.
G. DISBURSEMENT
3.22 The proposed IBRD loan of $95 million would be disbursed over a period of
about six and a half years, consistent with the Bank's latest urban sector disbursement
profile for China. Disbursements would be as indicated below.
Loan

Total                        95.0
3.23   To expedite disbursements, a Special Account with an authorized allocation of
$5.0 million, representing about four months' average disbursements, would be
established. It would be replenished monthly or whenever the Special Account is drawn
down to 50 percent of its initial value, whichever occurs first. Disbursements would be
made against statements of expenditure (SOEs), confirmed by SPPMO, for: (a) contracts
for (i) civil works valued at less than $2.5 million; and (ii) equipment and materials
costing less than $0.5 million equivalent; (b) contracts for consulting services costing less
than $100,000 equivalent for firms and $50,000 equivalent for individuals; and



- 26 -
(c) training. Documents supporting the SOEs would be retained by SPPMO and made
available for inspection during the course of Bank supervision missions and by external
auditors. All other disbursements would be made against fully documented expenditures.
A Schedule of Disbursements is given in Annex 5. As an early start has been made on
some works, retroactive financing of up to $1.5 million (1.6 percent of the loan amount)
would be provided for expenditures incurred from October 1, 1996 covering initial goods
and works contracts, and consulting services. The project is expected to be completed by
December 31, 2002, and, therefore, the Loan Closing Date would be December 31, 2003.
3.24  The signing of contracts for packages A (institutional andfinancial strengthening)
and B (construction supervision services and support to SPPMO), satisfactory to the Bank,
is a condition of disbursement of the civil works category. The approval by the Bank of
(a) operational regulations governing XRBSL processing and approvals, and (b) the
execution of an acceptable financial agency agreement between SP and a bank for XRBSL
processing (Annex 12) are conditions of disbursement for the loan proceeds allocated to the
Environmental Pollution Prevention and Control component.
H. LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT
3.25  The project has four components that entail land acquisition and resettlement:
(a) the Jinan Yellow River Water Supply Project; (b) the Jinan Waste Water Collection
Project; (c) the Yantai Municipal District Heating Project; and (d) the Weihai Municipal
District Heating Project. The first subcomponent is entirely rural resettlement while the
other three subcomponent involve mainly urban resettlement. The total amount of
permanent land acquisition is 992 hectares. Compensation is also to be given for another
300 hectares of land that would be temporarily impacted after 2015. The number of
people to be physically relocated is 2,120 (667 households). The number of people who
require new livelihoods is 5,097, including dependents. The total number of people who
are directly affected by the project and require compensation is 6,031. The Jinan Yellow
River Water Supply Project requires the largest scale of resettlement and rehabilitation
(4,450 people).
3.26 Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs). In compliance with Operational Directive
4.30, each subcomponent has prepared a RAP, all of which have been reviewed by the
Mission's resettlement expert and found to be generally in accordance with the
requirements of the Bank. Each RAP sets out: (a) land acquisition and resettlement
policies and principles; (b) baseline surveys; (c) description of resettlement sites;
(d) resettlement  implementation  arrangements;  (e)  implementation  schedule;
(f) rehabilitation of livelihoods; (g) costs and budget; (h) participation of project-affected
people (PAP); (i) grievance mechanisms: and (j) monitoring and evaluation of RAP
implementation.
3.27 Rural Resettlement (Jinan Yellow River Water Supply Project). For the 304
households that require physical relocation, two-thirds would be provided new residential
sites nearby while the remainder (all from one village) would be relocated collectively to



- 27 -
a rural area within 5 km of the original location. The final location of housing would be
determined by the affected households. Most have expressed agreement to move to the
designated areas because the conditions would be better than the existing situations,
which suffer for poor drainage and related health problems. Compensation for housing
and other personal assets would be assessed and paid at the full replacement value,
without any allowance being deducted for depreciation. For the 4,450 people who lose
most of their agricultural land, compensation would be provided in the form of new land,
sharing of improved farmland, development of land-intensive agricultural activities (i.e.,
animal husbandry, fish ponds, vegetables), agricultural sideline activities, or job creation
schemes. Since the affected area is located in the suburbs of Jinan City, access to
employment activities is very good. The Jinan Municipal Government has approved a
project-specific regulation for land requisition and resettlement, and has proposed
preferential policies to reduce grain quotas, agricultural taxes, and education fees for the
project-affected people. JWSC has agreed to provide some construction jobs to the
affected persons and provide technical assistance for the construction of piped water
supply schemes for the affected villages.
3.28  Urban Resettlement. For the Jinan Waster Water Collection Project, 1,303
people are directly affected and entitled to compensation (including 475 people for the
retroactive component). The 363 households that require physical relocation can choose
between new government housing or cash compensation to relocate on their own. Most
of the affected households currently rent their housing, so they typically prefer to move to
new government housing and continue to rent. The new rental housing generally
provides better living conditions. For people who own their houses, they would be paid
the full replacement value, without any allowance being deducted for depreciation.
Allowances would be provided for moving expenses and lost wages during the transition
period. Livelihoods for people to be relocated would not be affected beyond the
transition phase. There are 82 commercial shops to be relocated and 21 enterprises or
institutions that are partially affected. The owners would be compensated for lost assets,
income and wages and would receive allowances during the transition phase. Any
workers affected by the relocation of shops or the disruption of enterprises would be
compensated for lost wages and guaranteed continued employment or assistance in
securing new employment. The first phase of the project has already involved the
resettlement of 119 households, 29 commercial shops and 7 enterprises. A separate RAP
for retroactive approval has been reviewed by the World Bank. Monitoring of the
completed resettlement was conducted by an independent agency (Shandong University)
and was reported to have been implemented satisfactorily.
3.29 For the Weihai District Heating component, the municipal government acquired
16 hectares of land from villagers in 1993.  The 56 affected farmers have been
compensated and employed in rural enterprises. WBHPC has received approval to
purchase the land from the municipal government as the site for the Weihai No. 3 Heat
and Power Plant. WBHPC prepared a retroactive RAP, which has been reviewed by the
World Bank. An independent agency (Shandong Academy of Social Sciences) has
reported satisfactory completion of resettlement with substantial increase in incomes of



- 28 -
all affected persons. Since 1993, two enterprises have located on the new site without
permits. WBHPC has agreed to compensate both enterprises for the full replacement
value of assets, and would assist the enterprises to find new land to reconstruct their
facilities. Once new facilities are constructed, the enterprises can be easily shifted with
no loss of revenue.
3.30  The Yantai District Heating component affects 117 people and 4.3 hectares of
land. No households are required to be physically relocated. Compensation for housing
and other personal assets would be assessed and paid at the full replacement value,
without any allowance being deducted for depreciation. Land acquisition would affect
one brick factory, which would be compensated and the investment would be used to start
a new production facility that can employ all 112 affected staff.
3.31  Resettlement Costs. The cost of fully implementing each RAP has been included
in the base cost for the Shandong Environment Project. The total cost of implementing
the four RAPs is estimated at Y 252 million (January 1997 prices), including physical and
price contingencies. Land acquisition and resettlement represents 14 percent of the total
project cost.
3.32 Implementation Arrangements. Resettlement would be implemented largely by
the project agencies, particularly for the urban components. Local government would
also play a key role to ensure the implementation is smooth and the compensation
amounts are acceptable to the project-affected persons. For the Jinan Wastewater
component, the Urban and Rural Construction Bureau would ensure that adequate
government housing options are available. For the Jinan Yellow River Water Supply
component, the local District and Town governments, along with the Jinan Land
Administration Bureau, would ensure the land compensation is adequate and that host
land acquisition and land readjustments are carried out: (a) according to Chinese laws
and local regulations; and (b) taking full consideration of the preferences of the affected
villages.
3.33  SPPMO is responsible for coordination of resettlement issues that require
interagency actions/decisions and for liaison with the World Bank. SPPMO would
ensure that each of the implementing agencies engages the services of independent
monitoring agencies (e.g., the Shandong Academy of Social Sciences or Shandong
University) as external resettlement monitors.
3.34 Implementation of the RAPs would be carried out in consultation with, and with
the participation of, the affected persons and their representatives. Mechanisms for the
redress of grievances of affected persons and adequate avenues for appeal exist.
3.35 Monitoring and Evaluation. The implementation of each RAP would have both
internal and external monitoring and evaluation. Internal monitoring would be carried
out by each project implementing agency, and quarterly reports would be provided to
SPPMO. The internal monitoring report formats have been agreed with the World Bank.
Resettlement evaluation criteria and monitoring indicators have been specified for each



- 29 -
subcomponent. The external monitors would verify the status of implementation as
reported in the internal reports and would conduct independent surveys to assess the
socioeconomic and qualitative aspects of resettlement.  For the Jinan Wastewater
Collection Project, the first external monitoring reports would be due March 1997, and
then semiannually thereafter. The first report for the Jinan Yellow River Water Supply
Project would be due June 1997, and then provided semiannually. For Yantai and Weihai
subprojects, only one or two external monitoring and evaluation reports is required
because resettlement is relatively minor and the implementation would be completed by
the end of 1997.
3.36 The framework for land acquisition and resettlement is shown in Annex 6.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained from Shandong Province and the local
municipal governments that they would: (a) carry out the resettlement and rehabilitation
of affected persons in a manner, and according to the RAPs, that is consistent with World
Bank guidelines; and (b) report quarterly on the progress using reporting formats agreed
to with the World Bank
I. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
3.37  The proposed project is classified as Category A for purposes of Environmental
Assessment (EA). In accordance with Chinese regulations, component-specific EAs and
a comprehensive project-wide EA were prepared. The project-wide EA has been
reviewed by the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) and the Bank and
found to be satisfactory. The findings of the EA are summarized in Annex 7. To ensure
satisfactory implementation of EA findings, SEPB has prepared an implementation
program. The environmental impact of the project is, on balance, substantially positive
and the benefits greatly outweigh the negative impacts. The project would reduce
pollution loads to the Xiaoqing River from Jinan, substantially reduce the present
unsustainable levels of groundwater abstractions in Jinan, and reduce coal consumption
and polluting emissions in both Weihai and Yantai.
3.38  There are, however, some negative impacts that require mitigation. Appropriate
arrangements have been made for the beneficial use, wherever possible, of construction
spoil sludge from wastewater treatment in Jinan and residues from coal combustion in
Weihai and Yantai. During negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom SP that it would
carry out or would cause to be carried out, in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; the
findings of the EA and implementation program.
J. PROJECT REPORTING AND SUPERVISION
3.39 The proposed project implementation schedule is shown in Annex 8. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that reports on project progress, including
progress on the implementation program of the EA, based on agreed monitoring indicators,
would be prepared by each implementing agency, consolidated by SPPMO, andforwarded
to the Bank by February 28, April 30, July 31 and October 31 of each year, commencing in
February 1998. The last progress report of each year would include the latest project cost



- 30 -
estimate and financing plan for the following year, including SP 's draft budget for local
counterpart funds.  A  list of proposed monitoring indicators for environmental
improvement is included as Annex 9. An implementation completion report, reviewing
the planned objectives and the achievements of the project, including costs and benefits
derived, and performance and contribution of all parties associated with project execution,
would be prepared by SP and submitted to the Bank within six months of the Closing Date.
3.40 To facilitate implementation, a Project Launch Workshop would be held in late
1997. Project supervision would monitor impact with respect to the objectives (para. 3.5),
and focus on key sector issues such as utility pricing and environmental regulatory
effectiveness. Bank Group experience with supervision of the ongoing Urban Infrastructure
and Environment Project in Liaoning Province, the Hubei Urban Environmental Project and
the Yunnan Environment Project, which, like the proposed project, are multicity projects,
suggests that Bank supervision would require about 105 staff-weeks over the life of the
project, of which about 35 staff-weeks would be at headquarters for the review of progress
and audit reports, procurement actions and correspondence, etc., and 70 staff-weeks would
be in the field. More intensive supervision would be required during the first three years of
the project, during which time the technical assistance would be made operational and many
procurement contracts would have been tendered, evaluated and awarded. Supervision
would be provided by environmental engineering and financial staff, as well as other
specialists, as needed. The Project Supervision Plan is shown in Annex 10.
3.41  A mid-term review would be held in about mid-2000 to assess critically the progress
in implementation of the various components of the project. The mid-term review mission
would pay particular attention to utility tariffs, environmental regulation, and associated
policy issues critical to project and sector success. During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that a mid-term review ofproject progress would be undertaken by September 30,
2000, and the agreed recommendations implemented thereafter.

4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. PROJECT MANAGEMENT
4.1   A Leading Group, headed by a vice-governor, was set up to guide and give policy
direction for the preparation, and subsequently, implementation of the proposed
Shandong Environment Project. Members of the Group include the Vice-Secretary
General of the Shandong Provincial Government (SPG), and directors from the Shandong
Provincial Planning Commission, Shandong Provincial Urban and Rural Construction
Commission, Shandong Finance Bureau (SFB) and Shandong Environmental Protection
Bureau (SEPB). The Leading Group designated the Construction Commission as the
agency responsible for managing the project as the planning, construction and
management of environmental infrastructure is the responsibility of construction
commissions within China. The Construction Commission in turn established the
Shandong Provincial Project Management Office (SPPMO) to prepare and execute the
project, including the supervision and monitoring of contracts, maintenance of project
records, and the submission of progress reports to the Bank (para. 3.39). SPPMO is
headed by a director who is assisted by four deputy directors from the Shandong
Provincial Planning Commission, Shandong Provincial Urban and Rural Construction
Commission, SFB and SEPB. Leading Groups were also set up in each of the project
municipalities of Jinan, Weihai and Yantai, under which municipal project offices were
established within the municipalities' urban and rural construction commissions. During
project preparation, SPPMO and the municipal project offices received regular policy
guidance from their respective leading groups. The municipal project offices in turn
created and staffed subproject offices in each of the implementing agencies listed in Table
4.1 below.
4.2   SPPMO, working closely with SEPB and other interested government agencies, has
provided functional guidance to the municipal project offices, has interacted well with them
and with its consultants and design institutes, has expedited resources to undertake
preparation, and has arranged for the project preparation work to be completed to the
satisfaction of SP and the Bank. SPPMO would have the following responsibilities during
project implementation:
(a)   overall project coordination, macro-level project management and
monitoring;
(b)   annual budget preparation;
(c)   projectwide quality assurance;



- 32 -
(d)   progress reporting to SP and the Bank, including cost management, project
impact and environmental improvement assessment;
(e)   interagency coordination and procurement support; and
(f)   sectoral training facilitation.
4.3    To enable SPPMO to undertake this work effectively, it has been strengthened, and
the personnel skill mix adjusted to reflect the needs of the implementation and construction
phase of the project. During negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom SP that SPPMO
and the participating municipalities' project offices would be maintained throughout
implementation with functions and responsibilities satisfactory to the Bank, with competent
staff in adequate numbers for the duration of the project.
B. IMPLEMENTATION RESPONSIBILITIES
4.4    The institutions designated by SP and its municipal governments to implement, and
finance, the various components of the project are listed in Table 4.1.

4.5    Provincial and Municipal Institutions.  Shandong Province is headed by a
governor who is assisted by eight vice-governors, who oversee several commissions
and/or departments. Various provincial commissions, departments and bureaus provide
supervision and guidance to the municipalities on matters relating to infrastructure,
planning, development and operation, including environmental protection works.
Organization charts of SPG, the project municipalities, and the project implementing
agencies, including their interrelationship, are given in Annex 11.
4.6    The organization of the municipal governments of Jinan, Weihai and Yantai is
similar. Municipal affairs are overseen by the municipal economic and planning



- 33 -
commissions, and municipal urban and rural construction commissions.  The latter
commissions supervise a number of bureaus that are responsible for the physical planning,
design, construction, operation and maintenance of urban infrastructure, including
environmental infrastructure, and for environmental protection. In addition, several bureaus
concerned with urban infrastructure report directly to the office of the mayor. These include
the Finance Bureau, the Water Conservancy Bureau, the Bureau of Public Health and
Public Security Bureau.
4.7   As part of China's and Shandong's policy of reforms in the public utilities sector,
the participating municipalities recently established self-accounting and self-funding state-
owned enterprises to implement the wastewater component (Jinan) and the district heating
component (Weihai and Yantai) (paras. 4.10-4.12). The water supply and district heating
components of Jinan would be implemented by the municipality's existing water supply
and district heating agencies, established earlier. Prior to negotiations, the Bank received
(a) conformed copies of the charters, and (b) business licenses of all these enterprises.
4.8   Water Supply. The Jinan Water Supply Company (JWSC) was established in
1936 as a self-funding, self-accounting, state-owned enterprise, responsible for the
planning, construction management, operation and maintenance, consumer service
(billing and collection), and administration of water supply in Jinan City. JWSC reports
to the Jinan Municipal Affairs Management Bureau, which comes under the Jinan Urban
and Rural Construction Commission. At the time of its establishment, it supplied about
7,600 m3/day for about 1,700 residential and industrial units in the commercial area of the
city. Currently, its installed design capacity is around 895,000 m3/day. However, actual
available supply is some 714,000 m3/day owing to resource constraints. Like other long-
established water supply companies in China, JWSC has built up a solid reputation for
providing a reliable and good-quality water supply. However, with total personnel of
about 2,950, staffing levels and its administration costs are high by industry standards.
Technical assistance to be provided under the project would help JWSC to rationalize its
expenses and improve its accounting and management information systems.
4.9   Wastewater. Prior to the creation of the wastewater entity in Jinan (para. 4.10),
wastewater collection, treatment and disposal were provided by the Jinan Drainage and
Administration Division (JDAD), which reported to the Jinan Urban Construction Bureau.
JDAD did not operate on a financially autonomous basis, transferring, instead, all revenues
collected to its parent bureau. Funds were consolidated at that level and reallocated for
operation, maintenance and capital works, on the basis of budgets prepared and submitted
by JDAD.
4.10 The Jinan Municipal Drainage Company (JMDC) was established in September
1996 as a self-funding, self-accounting, state-owned enterprise, to be responsible for the
planning, construction management, operation and maintenance, consumer service
(billing and collection), and administration of wastewater collection, treatment and
disposal in Jinan City. It has a sanctioned staff strength of 1,218, of which about 1,023
were transferred from JDAD and 173 from the sewerage treatment works of Jinan Urban



- 34 -
and Rural Construction Commission. While the staff are familiar with wastewater
operations, there is as yet no corporate tradition in JMDC. Technical assistance to be
provided under the project would assist JMDC to implement its organizational plans, and
establish accounting, finance and management information systems appropriate for a
large public utility. Existing wastewater assets, in the form of sewers, pump stations,
wastewater treatment plant and monitoring station, have been transferred to JMDC.
While JMDC would account for its own capital and operating costs, it would, for the
present, be required to remit its revenues to its parent bureau, such funds being eannarked
to finance the operation and maintenance of the sewerage facilities, and service debt. The
remitted revenues, therefore, would be returned in their entirety to JMDC. While less
desirable than full autonomy, some water companies function efficiently under such a
system. JWSC, however, retains its revenues to finance its operations.
District Heating Companies
4.11 Weihai Botong Heat and Power Company Ltd. The Weihai Botong Heat and
Power Company Ltd. (WBHPC) was established in September 1996 as a self-funding,
self-accounting, state-owned enterprise, to be responsible for the planning, construction
management, operation and maintenance, consumer service (billing and collection), and
administration of the proposed district heating investments to serve the southern part of
Weihai City, comprising about 24 km2. It reports to the Weihai Municipal Affairs
Management Bureau, which comes under the Weihai Urban and Rural Construction
Commission. When fully operational, WBHPC would have a staff strength of about 375,
and a production capacity of 24 MW of electricity, 60 MW of hot water, and 75 tons/hour
of steam.
4.12 Yantai. The Yantai Heat Supply Company Ltd. (YHSC) was established in
September 1996 as a self-funding, self-accounting, state-owned enterprise, to be
responsible for the planning, construction management, operation and maintenance,
consumer service (billing and collection), and administration of the proposed district
heating investments to serve the central urban, and densely populated, area (Zhifu
District) of Yantai. YHSC would purchase heat from an existing power company, the
Huang Bo-Hai Power Plant Company Ltd., for distribution to its customers. YHSC has
entered into an agreement with Huang Bo-Hai Power Plant Company Ltd. for the
purchase of bulk heat supplies. The agreement stipulates the terms and conditions of
water and electricity sales, as well as the boundary limits of hardware and heat supply
control principles. A copy of the agreement is in the project file (Annex 16). YHSC
reports to the Yantai Municipal Affairs Management Bureau, which comes under the
Yantai Urban and Rural Construction Commission. When fully operational, YHSC
would have a staff strength of about 545, and a connected heat load of about 500 MW.
4.13 Both Weihai and Yantai (para. 4.12) cities had had previous experience in
operating district heating systems so some staff are partially trained. Technical assistance
to be provided under the project would, however, assist the cities to establish their newly-



- 35 -
formed companies on modem utility lines, supplemented by corresponding accounting
and management information systems.
4.14 Environmental Pollution Prevention and ControL The Xiaoqing River Basin
Subloans Facility (XRBSL) would be operated by SEPB in collaboration with SFB, with
segregated accounting and special operating procedures. The management and operation of
XRBSL are summarized in Annex 12. The purpose of the subloans facility would be to
provide funds for environmental pollution prevention and control, targeted to small- and
medium-size enterprises located in the XRB. Project selection, appraisal, both technical
and financial, and environmental criteria have been proposed and generally follow those of
similar funds in operation elsewhere in China. Projects would be selected according to cost
effectiveness and financial viability, with the first three appraisals and all appraisals for
proposed subloans of over $300,000 receiving ex-ante review by the Bank and the
remainder subject to ex-post review. The principal funding sources for XRBSL would be
funds allocated by SP (para. 3.14), the proceeds of the Bank loan, and recycling of loan and
interest payments.
4.15  The environmental degradation of the XRB is of sufficient gravity to motivate
SPG to an prepare environmental action plan to address the most significant pollution
issues in the river basin, together with working-level plans for the three top-ranked point-
source polluters. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from SP that it would
carry out, or cause to be carried out: (a) its time-bound XRB Environmental Action
Plan, acceptable to the Bank, to address the significant point sources ofpollution in that
area (including implementing measures to strengthen the pollution discharge permit
system); (b) an environmental data collection update, to be completed by June 30, 1998,
and which, on completion, would be reviewed with the Bank; and (c) time-bound
Environmental Action Plans for the three top-ranked polluters in the XRB. These latter
include two paper mills and one brewery. SPG is also proposing to carry out a study
designed to assist its XRB Commission, SEPB and other responsible agencies, to
implement recently issued provincial government pollution control decisions and
regulations (para. 2.24), including river section pollution control allocation and discharge
pernit system. Arrangements for the safe disposal of power plant residues in Weihai and
Yantai were reviewed at appraisal, and satisfactory arrangements were identified for this
disposal.
4.16 Technical Assistance and Training. As a wastewater company in Jinan and the
district heating companies of Weihai and Yantai have been created only recently, the
project's management and agency strengthening component has been designed specifically
to address the accounting, management information, financial management, utility pricing,
technical requirements and training needs of these implementing entities. Some technical
assistance would also be provided SPPMO, and to the existing JWSC to strengthen its
management capability.

5. FINANCE
A. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
5.1   Since 1978, Chinese economic reforms have evolved gradually toward an
increasingly decentralized financial system in China. Most industrial production and
prices have become free of government control, and enterprises have to purchase most of
their inputs at market prices. Enterprise reform has become a high priority of the
Government. In this connection, the guiding principles of the recently promulgated
"regulations on transforming the management mechanisms of state-owned industrial
enterprises" are to separate government administration from enterprise management,
increase the autonomy and accountability of state-owned enterprises, and increase
competition and market orientation. The reform efforts to improve economic policies and
enterprise efficiencies are essential for sustaining both economic development and
environmental protection in the longer run.
5.2   In order for the enterprises to assume their increased responsibilities efficiently and
effectively, the strengthening of their financial management is essential. Toward this end,
the proposed project would support the applications of modern management techniques and
huuman resource development for the utility companies.
B. ACCOUNTING
5.3   Under the project, the following accounting systems, in accordance with
regulations prescribed by the Ministry of Finance, apply.
5.4   Enterprise Accounting. All state-owned enterprises in China follow a unified
enterprise accounting system. The accounting framework was developed in the context of a
highly centralized planned economy. With a view to complementing the ongoing efforts to
deepen reforms in the financial sector and enterprise management, the accounting system in
China needed modernization to permit satisfactory financial management in an increasingly
decentralized and market-oriented environment. As a first step, the general principles of
enterprise (the term to include public utilities such as water, sewerage, and district heating
companies) accounting were revised by the Ministry of Finance from July 1, 1993 to be
more consistent with internationally generally accepted accounting practice. Further
reforms are under way to combine aspects of the Constructioii Unit Accounting System
with the Enterprise Accounting System for state-owned enterprises that are responsible for
construction of their own investment projects. Until the Government has completed the
modifications, all enterprises included in the project would follow both systems.
5.5   Government Accounting. The regular government department accounts reflect
expenditures incurred against budget allocations by SP or its municipal governments.



- 38 -
Accounting is handled in a decentralized manner through transfers to subunits from which
actual expenditures are made and recorded on a cash basis. Accounts are kept at all levels,
and each subunit reflects in its accounts the budget allocation it receives from the unit
above.
5.6   Project Accounts.  Project accounts would be maintained by SPPMO, in
accordance with the State Construction Unit Accounting System. This system prescribes
generally accepted accounting practices, including double-entry bookkeeping, subsidiary
ledger accounting, and rules for capitalizing and expending various items of expenditure. It
also sets out detailed accounting definitions for capital works, cash control, receivables and
payables. In addition, it identifies a number of basic monthly, quarterly and annual
reporting formats, including funds flow statements and balance sheets. The construction
accounting system is comprehensive, and is adequate for the proposed project.
C. AUDITS
5.7   As with other Bank-financed projects in China, the Foreign Investment Audit
Bureau of the China National Audit Office (CNAO), established in 1983 under the name of
State Audit Administration, would have overall responsibility for auditing accounts
concerning the project. The actual auditing work would be conducted by the Shandong
Provincial Audit Department under CNAO's supervision. This arrangement is satisfactory.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the following annual audits would be
submitted to the Bank within six months after the end of the financial year: (a) audit of the
project accounts maintained by SPPMO, (b) audit of the Special Account; (c) audit of
SOEs; and (d) audits of the financial statements of (i) JWSC, (ii) JMDC, (iii) WBHPC,
(iv) YHSC; and (v) XRBSL. Understandings were obtained during negotiations that audit
reports would include opinions on whether implementing agencies were in compliance
with their respective financial covenants, and whether these agencies had taken out
adequate insurance on goods and works financed from loan proceeds. The Bank would
expect to receive the first such audit reports by June 30, 1998, covering project
implementation activities commencing in fiscal year 1997.
D. PROVINCIAL FINANCE
5.8   SPG has two types of finance, on-budgetary and off-budgetary. On-budgetary
revenues are provided through taxes, the base and rate of which are set by the Central
Government. The Central Government directly controls the single largest tax source-the
value-added tax-receipts from which are shared with local government. A variety of other
taxes are collected and used directly by local government. Most off-budgetary revenues
consist of special fees paid by enterprises, and fees and charges relating to construction
activities. These are used for capital expenditures. On-budgetary and off-budgetary
accounts are not consolidated. Information on off-budgetary revenues and expenditures is
not formally published; the appraisal mission was satisfied that these are at least as large as
the on-budgetary data, thereby providing an assurance that provincial resources are
adequate to support project implementation.



- 39 -
5.9   SP would recover the debt associated with the project as it is being passed on to the
municipalities and industrial enterprises. SP would monitor municipal finances to assure
that the municipalities and their respective agencies meet their debt service obligations.
Should the municipalities and their subborrowers be unable to fulfill their obligations, SP
would have no difficulty in covering debt service through its own resources, as the debt
service represented by the project is small compared to total provincial budgetary
expenditures. Provincial fiscal budgetary revenues and expenditures totaled about Y 38.9
billion ($4.7 billion) and Y 34.3 billion ($4.1 billion), respectively, in 1995. Between 1993
and 1995, revenues and expenditures increased on average by about 20 and 18 percent a
year in current terms, respectively. Revenues are derived mainly from taxes on industry and
commerce, which have been remitted by the municipalities. Revenues and expenditures are
projected to grow at about 10 percent per year in current terms, equivalent to between about
2 and 4 percent a year in real terms, during the project period. Projected receipts and
expenditures for Shandong Province and the Municipalities of Jinan, Weihai and Yantai are
provided in the report on Provincial and Municipal Financial Projections for fiscal years
1993 to 2005 (on-budget), which is included in the Project File (Annext16).
E. MUNICIPAL FINANCE
5.10  SP would, through the Municipalities of Jinan, Weihai and Yantai, provide all
funding not met by (a) the proceeds of the Bank loan, (b) municipal contributions, and (c)
funds generated internally by the implementing agencies. During project implementation,
the financial projections show that these requirements would be of the order of Y 544
million for Jinan, Y 232 million for Weihai, and Y 206 million for Yantai. The
Municipalities, like SP, have two sources of finance, on-budgetary and off-budgetary. The
off-budget details are confidential, and were not, therefore, provided to the Bank. The
municipal funding requirements would come from many more sources than municipal on-
budget revenue. SFB has independently assessed the municipalities' ability to generate the
required counterpart funds from assured sources.
5.11   Summarized projected on-budget revenue and expenditure statements of the
municipalities of Jinan, Weihai and Yantai for the period 1996-2003 are given in
Annex 13, together with assumptions to the projections. Average annual project-related
expenditures comprise between about 0.1 to 9.8 percent of the municipalities' annual total
on-budget expenditures.
F. TARIFFS
5.12  The water and wastewater tariffs are categorized into residential, commercial,
industrial and institutional consumers. The water tariff comprises three parts, a fee to
cover operation and maintenance costs, a water supply fund fee to finance system
capacity expansion, and a public utility tax. The wastewater tariff is charged against 80
percent of water consumption, the assumed wastewater discharge level, and is set at 30
percent of the water tariff. The wastewater fees are billed by the water supply company
on behalf of the wastewater company and transferred from JWSC to JMDC through the
Jinan Finance Bureau on a quarterly basis. Separately, the Water Conservation Office



- 40 -
collects a wastewater fee from industrial users based on groundwater reserve quotas and
remits this revenue to the wastewater company.
5.13 In May 1996, the Jinan Municipal Government (JMG) authorized increases in the
water supply tariffs with the result that both the JWSC and JMDC would-be able to meet
their financial covenants (paras. 5.21 and 5.22, respectively) in fiscal year 1997. The
current average water supply tariff is Y 0.70/m3; the current average wastewater tariff is
Y 0.33/m 3, based on 80 percent of water consumption.
5.14 Weihai would construct a combined heat and power (CHP) plant under the project
to offer district heating in winter, and cooling in summer to residential, commercial, and
institutional consumers, and sell steam to industry consumers year-round. Power
produced by the CHPs would be sold to the local grids at prevailing prices. WBHPC
expects to begin selling steam and heat commencing in 1998 when prices would need to
be set at Y 36.80/GJ and Y 23.00/m2, respectively. YHSC is primarily a distribution
company purchasing heat from an existing CHP, but it would also construct and operate
peak boilers to supply district heating to residential, institutional and commercial
customers. YHSC expects to sell district heating in limited quantities commencing in
1997. The average local heat tariff, which was raised on January 1, 1997 from
Y 18.72/n2 to Y 23.53/mi, is sufficient to enable YHSC to meet its financial covenant in
fiscal year 1997 (see Table 5.1).
5.15   The district heating and cooling tariffs consist of one charge only, based on the
area to be serviced. The steam sales tariff also has only one component, an energy
charge. In Weihai and Yantai, district heating bills of residential consumers are paid by
their sponsoring unit as part of their work benefits.

ld Effective from January 1, 1997.
5.16 The financial objectives set by the municipalities of Jinan, Weihai and Yantai for
their water, wastewater and district heating companies are for the agencies to achieve full
cost recovery on their operations, and in the case of JWSC, to make a reasonable



-41 -
contribution to its capital investment program as well. The annual tariff adjustments
required to meet these financial objectives are shown in Tables 5.2 and 5.3, and in Annex
14. However, in practice, water, wastewater and district heating tariffs are adjusted only
every two to three years at a time. It is possible, therefore, that in the intervening years
between tariff adjustments, some or all of the agencies may not be able to meet their
annual targets. In such eventualities, the agencies' operating revenues would need to be
supplemented from the general revenues of the parent municipality.
G. WATER SUPPLY AND WASTEWATER AGENCIES
5.17 Jinan Water Supply Company (JWSC). JWSC has in recent years relied on
government operating subsidies to maintain its operations. In 1996, its net losses are
expected to reduce to about 2 percent of sales revenue due to its mid-year implementation
of increased domestic, commercial and industrial tariffs. It had previously increased its
industry tariff effective the end of 1995. Electricity and administration are JWSC's
primary costs. Electricity is required to operate pumping stations. Administration, which
includes pensions, health care costs, and management salaries, would account for 20
percent of revenues in 1996, and is considered high by industry standards. JWSC plans
to limit increases in its administration budget; technical assistance proposed under the
project would assist JWSC to rationalize its expenses, including administrative expenses.
The financial objectives set for JWSC by JMG are for it to make reasonable contributions
to its capital investment program, after meeting its cash expenses. Projections made up to
the year 2003 show that JWSC would post surpluses if it is permitted to periodically
adjust tariffs as shown in Table 5.2 and improve operating efficiency by limiting
additional increases in management and meter reading staff.
5.18  JWSC's largest cost is electricity, amounting to 35 percent of its operating
revenues. About 58 percent of JWSC's revenues are derived from industrial consumers,
about 36 percent from residential consumers, and 6 percent from commercial consumers,
a trend which is expected to continue in the future. Billing and collections operate
smoothly, with collections running less than one month on average. During the project
implementation period from 1997 to 2003, JWSC's Y 1.4 billion capital investment
program, and changes in working capital and cash are expected to be financed 29 percent
from internal sources, 37 percent from long-term borrowing, and 34 percent from
govermment counterpart funds. Corporate debt is expected to remain below 20 percent
during the implementation period, which would enable further borrowing for future
expansion.
5.19 Jinan Municipal Drainage Company (JMDC). Prior to the formation of JMDC
as a public enterprise on September 10, 1996, the Jinan Public Utilities Bureau, Drainage
Division, oversaw sewerage collection, treatment and disposal, and the Jinan Municipal
Urban Construction Bureau managed the planning and construction of new wastewater
assets. The total value of the wastewater treatment works, completed in 1995, and
drainage network assets transferred to JMDC, is Y 343 million. The financial objective



- 42 -
set by JMG for JMDC is to achieve full cost recovery, and if possible, generate some
funds for future capital investment.

5.20   Since wastewater revenues are directly proportional to water sales, industry,
followed by residential consumers, are the largest revenue sources of JMDC. The largest
cash expense is electricity, accounting for 65 percent of expenses. JMDC's capital
investment program, increases in working capital and cash changes, totaling about Y 1.0
billion during the implementation period, would be financed 29 percent by internal cash
generation, 37 percent by long-term borrowing, and 34 percent by government
counterpart funds. Corporate debt is anticipated to remain less than one-third of the
capital structure during project implementation, allowing for further borrowing to finance
construction of a planned phase II wastewater treatment facility beginning in 2002.



- 43 -
5.21  The salient features of the future finances of (a) JWSC and (b) JMDC, based on the
indices and exchange rates mentioned in para. 3.9, are highlighted in Table 5.2. The
assumptions used in the financial projections, and detailed operational and financial
monitoring indicators are included in Annex 14. The projected financial statements are
provided in the Report on Public Utilities Projections and Assumptions, dated March 15,
1997, which is included in the Project File (Annexj16). The organizational structure of each
utility and local sector structure are shown in Annex 11.
5.22 Assurances were obtained during negotiations that JWSC shall (a) produce for each
fiscal year commencing in fiscal year 1997, total revenues sufficient to cover its operating
and maintenance costs (before depreciation), increases in working capital, debt service,
and 20 percent of the average capital expenditures made in a three-year period (the year
preceding the reference year, the reference year itself and the year after the reference
year); and (b) incur no additional debt without the Bank's agreement, unless a reasonable
forecast shows that it would have a debt service coverage of at least 1.3 times. An
understanding was obtained during negotiations, and recorded in the minutes of
negotiations, that JWSC would limit management and meter reading staff increases during
the project implementation period in order to absorb excess administrative overhead.
5.23 Assurances were obtained during negotiations that JMDC shall (a) produce for
each fiscal year, commencing with fiscal year 1997, total revenues sufficient to cover its
operations and maintenance costs (including depreciation), and the amount by which debt
service requirements exceed the provision for depreciation; and (b) incur no additional
debt without the Bank's agreement, unless a reasonable forecast shows that it would have a
debt service coverage of at least 1.3 times.
H. DISTRICT HEATING AGENCIES
5.24 Weihai Botong Heat and Power Company Ltd. (WBHPC). When the CHP
plant operations under this project commence in 1998, WBHPC expects to receive 42
percent of its revenue from power, 43 percent from steam, and 15 percent from district
heating operations. Operating costs, in all CHP plants, however, are highly dependent on
the price of coal, since coal is expected to account for about 80 percent of operating costs.
Capital investment of Y 343 million, increases in working capital and cash changes
during the project implementation period would be financed through 24 percent internal
cash generation, 40 percent through long-term borrowing, and 35 percent from
government counterpart funds. During the project implementation period, debt levels
reach as high as 82 percent of the capital structure of the company and debt servicing is
tight, limiting the company's ability to weather downturns in projected sales volumes.
While billing for district heating and cooling services is expected to occur at the
beginning of each respective season, expectations are that users would on average remit
payment within one month. Billing and collections for steam would occur monthly based
on actual usage and annual winter heating fees are expected to be fully collected before
the heat is supplied to customers. WBHPC would be selling 100 percent of its heat (hot
water) production to Weihai South Heating Supply Company, an existing heat



- 44 -
distribution company responsible for servicing both existing and future domestic
households. In order to protect the financial viability of WBHPC, an understanding was
obtained during negotiations that Weihai Municipality would assist Weihai South Heat
Supply Company to meet its obligations to WBHPC should the company not be in a
position to pay WBHPC from its own sources within 45 days of receipt of heating bills
issues by WBHPC.
5.25  Yantai Heating Supply Company Limited (YHSC).  YHSC's operating
revenues would be received solely through sale of space heating to residential and
commercial users in Yantai's city center. Service is expected to commence in 1997, but
not reach full coverage until 2000. The company's main operating expense is purchased
heat, since only 15 percent of required heat for heat production is produced in-house. The
project's capital expenditures, increases in working capital and changes in cash would be
financed 21 percent through internal cash generation, 43 percent through long-term
borrowing, and 36 percent through government counterpart funds. Billing would take
place at the beginning of each heating season and customers are expected to pay for the
season's service within one month.
5.26 The salient features of the future finances of (a) WBHPC and (b) YHSC, based on
the indices and exchange rates mentioned in para. 3.9, are highlighted in Table 5.3. The
assumptions used in the financial projections, and detailed operational and financial
monitoring indicators are included in Annex 14. The projected financial statements are
provided in the Report on Public Utilities Financial Projections and Assumptions dated
March 15, 1997, which is included in the Project File (Annex 16). The organizational
structure of each utility and local sector structure are shown in Annex I1.
5.27 During negotiations, assurances were obtained that WBHPC and YHSC shall
(a) produce for each fiscal year, commencing with fiscal year 1997 in the case of YHSC,
and fiscal year 1998 in the case of WBHPC, total revenues sufficient to cover their
operations and maintenance costs (including depreciation), and the amount by which debt
service requirements exceed the provision for depreciation; and (b) incur no additional
debt without the Bank's agreement, unless a reasonable forecast shows that the entities
would have a debt service coverage of at least 1.3 times.
5.28 During negotiations, assurances were obtained that JWSC, JMDC, WBHPC and
YHSC wouldprepare, before September 30, 1998, and in each of the followingfiscal years,
forecasts satisfactory to the Bank and would (a) review whether they would meet the
covenanted requirements set forth above in such year and the followingfiscal year; and (b)
furnish the results of such reviews to the Bank If any such review would show that an
entity would not meet the requirements set out above, the entity would take all necessary
measures, including adjustments to the structure of its tariffs and charges, in order to meet
the requirements.

I. ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL
5.29   As some of the priority pollution control subprojects are, by nature, not financially
productive, the financial appraisal would focus on the long-term financial health of the
enterprises. The key considerations in this assessment include the enterprise's development
goals and strategy, product mix and market analysis, investment requirements and related
financing arrangements, and projected financial performance in terms of profitability,
liquidity and debt servicing capabilities. With a view to promoting prudent financial
management, the agreed subproject selection criteria call for the entity to maintain a debt
service coverage ratio of not less than 1.4 times after the proposed subproject has reached
full production capacity.

6. ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL
CONSIDERATIONS
A. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
6.1   The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) priorities of
environmental protection and alleviation of infrastructure bottlenecks, as described in
Chapter 2, and responds to China's priorities by supporting a national pilot program to
implement a river basin approach at the Xiaoqing River in Shandong Province.
Specifically, the project would support:
(a)   the provincial and municipal environmental protection bureaus (EPBs) in
their efforts to prepare and implement a comprehensive river basin
program, including the prioritization of interventions based on their cost-
effectiveness;
(b)   the establishment of financially sustainable utilities through the creation of
new corporations with a separate budget, such as the Jinan Drainage
Company, and through a tariff policy that assures the coverage of
operational costs and debt service and an increasing contribution to future
investments;
(c)   reduction of water pollution from Jinan city through the expansion of
sewerage services and full utilization of the existing treatment capacity,
thereby protecting the urban environment and the health of their people
and those living downstream of these cities;
(d)   protection of groundwater and improvement of water supply in Jinan,
through a shift toward surface water and stabilizing of water supply even
during the dry season;
(e)   reduction of air pollution in Weihai and Yantai through more efficient
central district heating systems, replacing a large number of small
inefficient boilers and stoves; with the added benefits of minimizing
economic costs through large coal savings; and
(f)   reduction of industrial pollution through a line of credit and technical
assistance that focuses on the dissemination of cost-effective cleaner
technologies.

B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
6.2  In recent years, the cost of environmental degradation caused by urban pollution
has become very apparent in Shandong Province and has translated into financial losses
and the disappearance of whole sectors, such as aquaculture in the estuary of the
Xiaoqing. In response, the Province plans to embark on a comprehensive program to
reduce pollution. Such program represents a major investment for the Province and a
challenging task of coordinating a wide array of activities and institutions.
Implementation of the program therefore requires careful prioritization of interventions to
maximize their net benefit in terms of environmental improvements.   Since
environmental benefits can only partially be translated into monetary values, often the
choice of priority interventions has to be guided by cost-effectiveness considerations.
Such a least-cost approach to achieve environmental improvement was successfully
applied in the selection of several project components. Three of the components achieve
cost-effectiveness by making better use of existing but underutilized urban infrastructure.
The proposed project would provide the critical missing link to fully utilize existing
capacity, e.g., the water supply component in Jinan would allow the existing water
treatment plant to increase capacity utilization from less than 25 percent to about 100
percent. The environmental subloans to industry, in turn, focus on cost-effective
interventions of pollution prevention and waste minimization, thereby helping industry to
achieve a satisfactory environmental performance at a lower cost compared to traditional
end-of-pipe solutions. The proposed district heating components in Weihai and Yantai
are not only the environmentally most benign solutions, but they are also the least-cost
economic alternatives before accounting for environmental benefits.
6.3  In addition to investments, Shandong Province and its cities need changes in
policy and institutional structures to achieve environmental improvements. A key
problem are urban environmental services that are priced too low to discourage waste
generation or to generate the self-financing needed to build, maintain and operate services
such as district heating or wastewater treatment. Therefore, investment choices were
made in view of supporting institutional and tariff reforms, such as the creation of the
Jinan Municipal Drainage Company (JMDC), which takes over responsibility for
wastewater from a former government bureau.
City and Sector Choices
6.4   Specific investment choices within sectors and cities responded to local priorities
and long-run municipal strategies to expand urban environmental services and to meet
minimum national ambient environmental quality standards. Three cities were selected:
Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, which ranks fourth among the 37
"environmentally most stressed cities in China" according to a National Environmental
Protection Agency (NEPA) pollution index, was selected because of its major
environmental problems and its immediate impact on the water quality of the Xiaoqing
River. The other two cities, Yantai and Weihai, are medium-size cities that had a clearly
defined strategy to address their air pollution problems through the expansion of district



-48 -
heating and offered opportunities to demonstrate new technologies that would be relevant
to other, similarly sized cities in the province.
Credit Line for Pollution Abatement
6.5   Reducing industrial pollution is a cornerstone of the XRB program. The Province
has established a subloans facility, to be initially capitalized at $10 million, for which it
requested a Bank loan of $5 million. In line with China's new market-oriented approach
to lending for industries, the pollution prevention and control line of credit would
introduce strict financial and technical evaluation criteria, and would not offer
concessional interest rates. The line of credit would be a transitional and catalytic
financial mechanism to help overcome the credit-market constraints for environmental
investments (more fully described in the China Department's 1995 Capital Market Sector
Study). The major benefit of the facility would be the demonstration of a cost-effective
approach to pollution reduction by applying cleaner production, waste minimization, and
waste recovery techniques. The fund focuses on top-ranked small- and medium-size
major polluters that discharge into the Xiaoqing River; the pollution reduction is
estimated to be significant at an enterprise level, but, given the magnitude of industrial
pollution in the river basin, the expected impact on the water quality of the Xiaoqing
River would onjy be marginal.
Water Supply in Jinan
6.6   The purpose of the Jinan Water Supply Component is to halt groundwater
depletion while meeting the increasing water demand from Jinan's urban population and
industry. The project would achieve this by increasing the supply of surface water from
the Yellow River and by compensating for seasonal fluctuations of the river flow. The
immediate benefit to the serviced population of about 1 million is an increased water
supply of 400,000 m3/day, which would effectively reduce current water shortages. The
economic net benefit of improved water supply is about Y 150 million and the economic
rate of return (ERR) 18 percent. The long-term benefit includes a slightly reduced
groundwater extraction, which is a first step toward a return to sustainable levels of
groundwater management.
6.7   The project represents the least-cost option because of its effective use of existing
but underutilized infrastructure, its closeness to the existing water treatment plant and to
its consumers, and the contribution to a reduced groundwater extraction. Alternative
schemes were considered but were more costly or unsustainable: (a) the investment cost
of a surface water extraction scheme at Tianshan on the Yellow River, upstream of Jinan
to supply the same volume of water would be 58 percent higher and the unit cost per ton
of treated water per day would be 11 percent higher than for the proposed project. (b) If
the additional volume of water were to be supplied from groundwater, overall extraction
in the year 2000 would reach about 1.2 million m3/day, more than double the long-term
sustainable extraction volume of 500,000 m3/day. Overextraction would accelerate the
drop in the average groundwater level, which has already dropped from about 29 meters



- 49 -
(m) to less than 26 m above sea level over the last 30 years and further reduce the flow of
Jinan's famous springs. Reduced spring flow also reduces the flow of surface water
within Jinan and to the Xiaoqing River and, as a consequence, increases the concentration
of pollution from industrial and domestic effluents, specifically during the dry season. In
the long run, overextraction could lead to a irreversible loss of the groundwater resource.
6.8   Improvement in water use efficiency is a critical element in achieving the project
objectives. Industrial water demand is projected to increase from about 650,000 m3/day
in 1996 to 950,000 m3/day in 2010, assuming an ambitious annual 6 percent decline of
the water consumption per unit of industrial output. Jinan has a track record of already
having achieved, between 1990 and 1995, a reduction from 15,000 m3/Y million to 6,000
(a 20 percent per year reduction). Nonetheless, achieving such sustained water use
efficiency would require special attention to and incentives for water conservation
measures in industry. For private households, rising water tariffs are likely to encourage
water conservation: a price elasticity of -0.17 for domestic per capita water consumption
was estimated based on the last 15 years of JWSC's sales. However, rising incomes and
living standards would more than compensate this impact with an estimated per capita
income elasticity of 0.22. As a result, aggregate demand from households (including
public buildings) for which the population growth rate is estimated at 2.3 percent (1.9
percent after 2000) would increase from about 300,000 m3/day in 1995 to over 650,000
m3/day in 2010.
Jinan Wastewater
6.9   The Jinan Wastewater Component is a first step to reduce the city's contribution
to the pollution of the Xiaoqing River. The proposed project would provide the missing
connection to the sewerage network and enhance its collection capacity to allow the STW
to operate at its full capacity of 220,000 m3/day, or about 45 percent of the total waste
stream. The project has the immediate benefit to provide improved sewerage services to
a service population of about 1 million, and to reduce Jinan's pollution load into the
Xiaoqing River by about 32,000 tons of chemical oxygen demand (COD) annually.
While this would reduce COD concentration in the river by almost 100 mg/l (or 45
percent), river quality would still exceed Class V Standards of 25 mg/l by a factor of 5
and make it necessary for Jinan to further increase its treatment capacity after completion
of this first phase. Within the city, the project complements the long-term effort of the
water supply project to ensure a sustainable groundwater supply because reduced quantity
and concentration of surface water pollution would also reduce groundwater pollution.
6.10  The quantification of the economic benefits, which are largely environmental and
health improvements, poses challenging analytical problems.  But even without
quantification, it is evident that the utilization of the idle sewage treatment plant makes
this investment highly cost-effective. The annual reduction of 32,000 tons COD is
achieved through an incremental investment of Y 264 million over a lifetime of at least
15 years. By contrast, without the project, Jinan already incurs an annual cost of



-50 -
approximately Y 15 million for depreciation and maintenance of the idle STP without
achieving any environmental or other benefit.
District Heating
6.11  The proposed district heating components in Yantai and Weihai are aimed at
reducing air pollution by replacing inefficient small boilers and stoves with high-
efficiency district heating networks to serve residential and industrial heating and steam
processing needs. The projects would reduce SO2 and TSP emissions through a
combination of more efficient heat generation, better pollution abatement equipment and
higher stacks than the existing heating facilities have. The immediate benefits are heat
services to a population of 400,000 in Yantai. In Weihai, they would provide heat
services to a population of 150,000 in addition to supplying steam for industries and
power cogeneration.
6.12  Three approaches were chosen for the economic analysis: (a) least-cost analysis
of the district heating projects and two other options in terms of their heat generation and
distribution costs; (b) environmental impact comparison, including coal consumption and
emissions of SO2, TSP, and carbon dioxide (CO2); and (c) intangible economic cost and
benefit considerations. The following three Options were considered when determining
the least-cost option for meeting the estimated future demand of residential heat,
industrial steam, and cooling in the project areas by the year 2000: (a) Option 1-
business as usual, i.e., the provision of heat through a combination of small boilers and
stoves, as today; (b) Options 2-small boilers only, i.e., the replacement of all stoves with
small boilers and continued use of the existing small boilers; and (c) Option 3-district
heating, the complete replacement of existing stoves and small boilers; this is the
proposed project.
Least-Cost Analysis
6.13  Results for Weihai. Introduction of district heating in Weihai's Economic
Development District would lead to the replacement of over 18,000 stoves and about 100
small boilers by the year 2000. Savings under the district heating option amount to
Y 0.35 billion if compared to the business-as-usual option and over Y 0.5 billion if
compared to the small boiler option. The respective ERR on these net savings are 28 and
41 percent, not including the savings from land reclamation. The economic advantage of
district heating appears robust even if compared against a "low-heat" alternative, whereby
stove owners would continue heating their rooms on average at a low room temperatures
of 10 to 12C during four hours a day only, thereby reducing their coal consumption to
one-third of te coal rtquired for constant 18C room temperature. District heating also
prevails as the preferred option if compared to much improved small boilers with an
increased efficiency of 65 percent, up from 50 percent. Table 6.1 summarizes these
findings.

percent to 65 percent and low stove temperature.
(4)  Scenario "Full Cost" includes economic costs for air pollution (based on estimated health

6.14   Results for Yantai. With the introduction of district heating in Yantai, 64,000
household stoves and 200 small boilers would have been replaced by the year 2000.
District heating would generate economic savings of Y 0.2 billion or Y 0.5 billion,
respectively, if compared to the other two options, which are largely the result of fuel
efficiency: district heating consumes 50 percent less with respect to Option 1, and 30
percent less than Option 2. Investment costs are lower, too. The ERR on these savings
are 24 percent or 66 percent, respectively. Further large savings are likely to result from
the reclamation of valuable urban land that is currently occupied by small boilers and that
would become available as these boilers are replaced by district heating. These land
reclamation benefits were not included in the analysis because their actual market value is
uncertain. Table 6.2 provides a summary of the results. Economic benefits are robust,
even when the construction of a new CHP plant (greenfield project) is considered.

Environmental Impact
6.15   Second, the three options were compared with regard to their environmental
impact. The district heating achieves reductions in S02, TSP, and C02 emissions
compared to the other options. In Yantai, annual emissions of S02 and TSP under the
district heating option are only 3 and 4 percent of what would be emitted under the
"business-as-usual" scenario, i.e., stoves and boilers. Figure 6.1 compares the economic
and environmental performance of the three options for Yantai using the business-as-
usual scenario as the baseline (Index = 100).

6.17  In order to assess the full cost of each option, the economic cost of air pollution
should be included. However, the methodologies to calculate the economic cost of air
pollution are still being debated and reliable data on health impact and exposure are not
available in Shandong. Some information on health costs related to air pollution is
available internationally, but this information needs to be adjusted to local circumstances.
In order to illustrate the impact of benefits from reduced air pollution damage on the
overall economic benefits, a simplified approach (so-called benefit-transfer approach) has
been applied, using data from Europe (the United Kingdom) adjusted by the ratio of GNP
in China and the United Kingdom. Based on this approach, the following benefits per ton
removed were applied: Y 440 for SO2, Y 3,800 for TSP, and Y 1.6 for CO2. As a result,
project costs increased by 15 percent to 50 percent for the various options. Considering
pollution cost makes district heating economically even more attractive: The district
heating option generates additional savings of Y 130 million in the form of reduced
emissions (or Y 90 million if compared to option 2). TSP reductions represent the largest
share (over 80 percent) of these savings, followed by SO2 (about 15 percent) and CO2
(less than 5 percent). Including the cost of pollution does not change the ranking of
options in this case, but points to additional benefits of the project for the local
environment (SO2, TSP) and the global environment (CO2 reduction).
6.18   Intangible Cost and Benefit Considerations.  These include the following:
(a) height of stacks of the two district heating plants, which are over 1 00 m high, allowing
for a better dispersion of emissions than the stacks of existing small boilers, which is
typically 20 to 35 m high; (b) tariff adjustments, which would lead to a sustainable
heating operation that fully recovers its costs; (c) demand-side management: the project
would promote the introduction of individual metering for each household unit. A
demonstration project would be implemented in Yantai that would test individual
metering and billing procedures.

6.19  In summary, the proposed District Heating solutions present a win-win
opportunity: the package of fuel efficiency, least-cost economic cost, and environmental
benefits makes the proposed project components attractive from an economic
environmental management, public finance, and an utility perspective.

Overall Program and Capacity Building
6.20  This project represents a major investment for Shandong Province.  These
economic costs are justified by environmental and social benefits that would be generated
through the project, including improved water quality in the Xiaoqing River and air
quality in two cities, protection of groundwater resources, and improved services for
water, wastewater, and heating.
6.21  Efforts have been made to quantify these benefits, but only an approximation and
rough estimates are possible based on available infonnation and current methodologies.
The results indicate that the project components contribute to environmnental
improvement through localized reduction of pollution levels and protection of natural
resources. When implemented, it would help to reduce downstream health damages and
production losses, such as the disappearance of aquaculture in the estuary of the Xiaoqing
River, which represents an estimated annual loss of more than Y 200 million. While the
quantum of economic benefits can only be estimated, it is clear that the project would
generate a positive net enviromnmental and social benefit.
6.22  The economic attractiveness of the project, beyond its environmental benefits, is
helped by the fact that several components also generate net economic savings in form of
reduced resource use, such as coal consumption for heating. These savings are generated



- 55 -
through technological improvements, such as increased fuel efficiency, and economies of
scale. Utility operators receive part of these economic savings in form of reduced costs
of operation. District-heating projects therefore represent true win-win opportunities that
make them attractive both from a society and a profit-making perspective. This
attractiveness should greatly help in the dissemination of this project type to other cities.
6.23   However, taken by themselves, the project components would only have a
localized impact and a marginal effect on overall environmental conditions in the
province. Only if the larger program, of which this project forms part, is implemented
and successful innovations introduced under the project are replicated in other places,
would a noticeable environmental improvement be achieved; this serves to underline the
importance of the Institutional Strengthening and Training component in strengthening
local capacity for implementing the larger program and applying available resources
effectively to maximize their environmental benefit. The value added by this component
would be the transfer of relevant cross-country experience and their adaptation to the
specific needs of the province. For example, the long-term study would provide support
for efficient pollution load allocation and its regulatory enforcement along the Xiaoqing
River. Choice of appropriate water quality levels has a major impact on the cost of the
program, and hence its viability: adopting overambitious targets would drain resources
away from higher impact interventions. Developing the necessary information base to
better evaluate the full economic cost and benefits of such interventions would be a
tangible benefit of the Institutional Strengthening component.
6.24 Investments in pollution reduction would not be sustainable without more
efficient use of resources. For example, water consumption in paper industry reaches 400
to 600 m3 per ton of product, way above the industry standard that is achievable with
current technologies (about 50 to 200 m3/ton). Excessive water consumption increases
the waste stream and requires higher investment in larger treatment plants. Low water
prices paid by some industries support such behavior. By effectively removing subsidies
for public utility services through the introduction of cost recovering tariff policies, the
project not only supports the financial viability of the utility but also creates a stronger
incentive for the efficient use of natural resources. Furthermore, by internalizing the cost
of pollution abatement of each project component into the tariffs, users have a stronger
incentive for the efficient use of these urban services.
C. AFFORDABILITY
6.25 As part of the Government's policy to establish financially viable utilities, tariffs
for urban environmental services would be raised to a level where operational costs are
covered and a contribution to future investments can be made. Since these utilities
provide essential services, the impact of these tariff increases on the poor was assessed,
using for reference the 1995 income of persons in "very poor households" as defined in
Shandong Province's 1995 Statistical Yearbook.  For water and wastewater, the
combined annual cost does not exceed 3 percent at the suggested 1997 and 2000 tariff
level. For district heating, on the other hand, the share is 8.5 percent and drops to 6.5



- 56 -
percent in 2000. While this is a considerable burden to poor households, the cost is
comparable to current expenditures for heating a coal stove. Even at drastically lower
heating standards, annual coal consumption is about 1.0 ton at an average cost of Y 488
per stove. If divided among two income earners, the annual cost is Y 240 per person,
compared to Y 230 per person for district heating.
D. PROJECT RISKS
6.26  The Bank-supported components of Shandong Environment Project form part of a
broader strategy to secure environmental improvements in the XRB and enhanced well-
being in Jinan and other project cities. Each component, if effectively implemented,
would make a local contribution to the regional objective of the River Basin. However,
to have a basinwide impact, the institutional innovations, the new approaches to pollution
management, and demonstrated technologies of each of the components need to be
replicated and complemented by sustained efforts across sectors and throughout the
Basin.
6.27  Risks surrounding the project have therefore been divided into two broad
categories: Short/Medium-Term Project Risks and Long-Term Strategic Risks. The
former center around the immediate requirements of the project and the successful
implementation of its components. The latter center around the overall impact of the
project and relate to the sustainability of environmental improvements in the XRB.
Short/Medium-Term Project Risks
6.28  The principal risks directly associated with the implementation of the project and
the achievement of immediate project outputs can be grouped in environmental/
technical, financial and institutional issues (as summarized in Table 6.3 below).
Long-Term Strategic Risks
6.29 Increase Environmental Pressures. Rapid economic and population growth,
together with urbanization and industrialization, would continue to exercise
environmental stress in the XRB. The carrying capacity of this ecological system is not
yet fully understood nor is the impact of the current developments. This limits the ability
of environmental management to give clear directions where, what type, and how much
development is compatible with the natural environment and hence sustainable.
6.30  Areas of potential conflict include the push for industrial growth and need to
protect the environment. Given the high returns on investments in a fast-growing
economy, pollution reduction is competing for scarce capital with high opportunity costs.
Only a systematic internalization of environmental externalities, as has started at a low
level with the introduction of pollution charges, would resolve this apparent conflict by
reflecting environment-related expenditures in the cost of doing business.



- 57 -
6.31   The investment components would, within their scope, mitigate some of these
risks by improving resources pricing and the provision of environmental services. The
technical assistance under the project would then play a key role in disseminating these
experiences and assist the Province to integrate them in the broader context of the river
basin. For example, the Long-Term Study for Xiaoqing River would provide planning
tools and data to anticipate and manage environmental risks (see Table 6.4 for a summary
of long-term risks).

- 63 -                    ANNEX 1
ANNEX 1: BACKGROUND TO SHANDONG PROVINCE AND
PROJECT CITIES
1.    The economy of Shandong province, which has a 1995 population of some 87
million (32 percent urban) has grown rapidly over the past decade. The 1995 per capita
GDP was Y 5,760, with an average annual growth rate of about 15.7 percent during the
period of 1990-95. The proportion of financial income to the total GDP had decreased
from 10.4 percent in 1985 to 7.7 percent in 1995. The average income of urban residents
and farmers in 1995 was Y 3,959 and Y 1,715, respectively.
2.    The principal industrial sectors in financial terms in Shandong in the past decade
include energy, chemical, textile, machine, and the food industry. The average annual
growth rates of industrial output for TVIEs have been extremely high over the period
1990-95 (35.4 percent for township enterprises and 36.1 percent for village enterprises),
much higher than that for state-owned enterprises (10.3 percent). TVIEs accounted for 63
percent of industrial output in 1995.
3.    The Province has been one of the engines driving China's impressive economic
growth over the past decade. This was primarily the result of substantial increases in
agricultural productivity and industrial output. The latter took place to a large extent in
Shandong's urban areas, particularly in Jinan, the capital city, and in the coastal cities of
Qingdao, Weihai and Yantai. As a consequence, Jinan City, for example, suffers from
coal emission pollution and acid rain from its abundance of industrial and residential
boilers, which is exacerbated by the city's adverse topographic location, with over 200
inversions per year. Thus, in terms of air quality, Jinan ranks fourth among the 37 most
environmentally stressed cities in China, constricting economic development, according
to NEPA. Most other cities in the province are also failing to meet national standards on
air pollution. The situation is especially alarming during the heating season (four months
of the year).
4.    Shandong Province has a rain-sparse climate with a large amount of the water
supply derived from underground sources. Some of these aquifers are being increasingly
polluted and reduced below replenishment amounts and domestic and industrial water has
to be extracted from often polluted rivers, rainfed reservoirs or piped from distant water
sources. Some cities, e.g., Jinan, Qingdao and Zibo, have to rely on costly water
transmission from the Yellow River. At the same time, most rivers and lakes, especially
the Xiaoqing River and Nanshi Lake, are heavily polluted, aggravating water shortages
and restricting long-term economic development.



-64 -                      ANNEX 1
Jinan
5.    Jinan Municipality, located in western Shandong, has an urban area of 2,119 km2
and a population of 1.5 million. The core area of the city is 1 10 km2, with a population of
1.5 million.
6.    The GDP of Jinan Municipality amounted to Y 48.1 billion in 1995, with an
annual growth rate of 15.2 percent. The per capita GDP was Y 8,884 in 1995, ranked
sixth among the 17 municipalities and prefectures in Shandong. Jinan's industrial base
includes machinery manufacture, steel, nonferrous metals, chemicals, building materials,
coal, textile, light industry, and food and beverage. In 1995, Jinan had 2,276 industrial
enterprises (county level and above). The total industrial and agricultural output in 1995
was Y 45.7 and Y 11.4 billion, respectively.
Weihai
7.    Weihai Municipality, located at the eastern end of the Shandong Peninsula, with
an area of 731 km2 and a population of 438,000, had a GDP of Y 33.7 billion in 1995,
with an annual growth rate of 14 percent. Weihai's industrial base includes light
industry, electronic, machinery manufacture, textile, and chemicals. The total industrial
and agricultural output in 1995 was Y 41.0 and 15.7 billion, respectively.
Yantai
8.    Yantai Municipality, located in the northeastern part of the Shandong Peninsula
with an area of 13,745 km2 and an urban population of 1.5 million in 1995, had a GDP of
Y 57.5 billion in 1995, with an annual growth rate of 15.5 percent, ranked in second place
in the province (after Qingdao). The main industrial sectors includes light industry, food
and beverage, textile, machinery manufacture, construction materials, coal, and
electronics. In 1994, Yantai Municipality had 2,558 industrial enterprises (township level
and above) and 8,191 village-level industrial enterprises.  The total industrial an
agricultural output in 1995 was Y 51.3 and Y 24.6 billion, respectively.

ANNEX 2: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.    The components of the proposed project investments are described in detail below,
followed by a summary in tabular form.
JINAN
2.    Jinan City, capital of Shandong Province, had a total industrial productive output
of Y 41 billion in 1995, which is projected to be around Y 74.5 billion in the year 2000.
Major industries include machinery, electrical, textile, petrochemical, paper and foods
and beverage production.
3.    The Jinan City Master Plan covering the period 1994-2010 was prepared by the
Municipal Planning Institute and Planning Bureau and issued in January 1996. The
designated city center area extends to about 600 km2, bounded by the Juye and Yufu
Rivers to the east and west, respectively, the Yellow River to the north, and Jiwang Road
at the south. The designated "central" area includes the city center, together with the
peripheral zones of Dongjia, Wangsheren, Dajin and Dangjia. The city center population
was reported at 1.47 million in 1995, and is projected to reach 1.95 and 2.35 million in
2000 and 2010, respectively. These projections include a floating population estimated at
0.25 and 0.30 million in those years.
4.    Water Supply System.  The Jinan Water Supply Company (JWSC) was
established in 1936 to provide a supply of about 7,600 m3/d at that time, through 40 km
of pipe network for about 1,700 residential and industrial units in the commercial area of
the city. The system has been progressively extended, particularly in the past 15 years or
so, with the present installed design capacity reported around 1,080,000 m3/d, although
the actual available supply is restricted to some 740,000 m3/d due to resource constraints.
The existing water distribution network now covers an area of some 364 km2 and extends
to about 1,150 km with pipes in the range 100 to 1,500 mm diameter, reported to include
cast iron, ductile iron, reinforced and prestressed concrete pipe materials. The ground
elevation across the supply area varies in the order of 90 m, and 11 booster pump stations
of capacity of 321,000 m3/d are located in the city.
5.    Groundwater has traditionally been the main water resource for the city.
However, this resource has been progressively supplemented in recent years by supplies
from impounding reservoirs and direct abstractions from the Yellow River in order to
control the "mining" of groundwater caused by overabstraction of this resource. The
water resource situation is summarized as follows:

Lb Actual average municipal supply in 1995 was 0.64 Mm3/d.
6.     Water Demand. The water demand projections through the planning horizon of
year 2010 have been estimated based on the following broad assumptions: population
served; industrial output value; and other uses (including public facilities, firefighting and
system losses). The population figures (including floating population) of 1.95 and 2.35
million in years 2000 and 2010 respectively have been adopted. Per capita demands of
190 lI/c/d (actual in 1995), rising to 240 and 300 I/c/d in years 2000 and 2010 have been
assumed; these trends are in line with other similar urban centers in China. The
respective figures for floating population are 100 and 130 l/c/d in years 2000 and 2010.
Industrial output in the supply area is projected to reach about Y 132.3 billion in year
2010, although the unit industrial water consumption is expected to fall progressively
over the planning period from 60 m3/Y 10,000 of output value in 1995 to 25 m by 2010
(about 5 percent per year), in line with national industrial trends. Other water uses are
expected to reduce from 18 percent (actual in 1995) to 16 percent in 2000 and 15 percent
by 2010, reflecting improved system operational efficiency and reduced system losses.
The water demand and resource projections are summarized as follows:

7.     Water Resource Planning. In order to address the apparent deficit in supply,
JWSC has identified the main system deficiencies and has developed a long-term
resource strategy. The deficiencies and problems include: insufficient surface water;
"mining" of groundwater; low reliability of Yellow River source without storage;
equipment defects at Huanghe No. 1 WTP; low system pressures in certain areas; old
pipe networks; and water wastage. The development plan, based on least-cost resource
mobilization, is summarized as follows:

9.    Under this project, the Queshan Reservoir Yellow River Abstraction scheme
would be implemented. This would provide a continuous supply of 440,000 m3/d of
desilted raw water to fully utilize the existing treatment capacity at the Huanghe No. 2
WTP, thus providing a supply of 400,000 m3/d of fully treated water to the city.
Assurances would be obtained that JWSC would undertake the necessary time-bound
investment program (Y60 million) to strengthen the distribution systems to ensure
satisfactory distribution of the new supply to consumers.
10.   Proposed Component ($62.6 million).  The proposed component would
comprise the following works:
(a)   Settlement Basin comprising grit channel about 700 m wide * about
3.2 km long, with earth embankments, access bridges, inlet/outlet gates,
channels and pump stations of about 900,000 m /day capacity, outlet
conveyor of reinforced concrete, or other materials, about 2,300 *
2,300 mm size, about 1.25 km long;
(b)   Regulating Reservoir comprising an earth embanked storage of about 46
million m3 capacity, of about 7.1 m average depth, with some 12 km of
embankments, ancillary equipment and facilities;

JINAN WASTEWATER SYSTEM
11.   A Sewerage Master plan was originally prepared in 1983; this was updated in
1993 and provides the basis for the sewerage planning for the city. The urban area of
Jinan is divided into seven catchments comprising Jiqi, Jiluo, Darning Lake, Liuhangtou,
Huangtai Qili River, Wangsheren and Danjia catchments totaling about 140 km2 in area.
12.   Existing Wastewater System.  The existing sewer system  comprises about
145 km of pipes in the catchments of Jiluo, Darning, Liuhangtou and Huangtai, in sizes
between 300 and 1,500 mm diameter, mostly of concrete pipe construction, with small
lengths of brick culverts and pipes. There are a number of pump stations, the most
significant of which is the Juluo Bridge station, built in 1985, of about 220,000 m3/d
design capacity, to lift sewage to the Jilan Wastewater Treatment Plant (SPT). This
station is presently underutilized pending the construction of a new intercepting sewer to
convey the flow to the SPT.
13.   The present wastewater flow from all seven catchments in the city is about
680,000 m3/day, comprising about 30 percent domestic and 70 percent industrial flows.
The existing sewerage system is partly combined and partly separate, and is seriously
inadequate with large parts of the 145 km of main and secondary sewers not functioning
satisfactorily, due to siltation, and blocking of the inverted siphons at river crossings. All
wastewater flows discharge directly or indirectly into watercourses within the city or to
the Xiaoqing River through existing sewers. As a result, the water quality in water
courses and lakes within the city and the Xiaoqing River has deteriorated to below
National Surface Water Class 5 Standard. The Wastewater Development Plan for the city
is summarized below.

14.   The Jinan STP is designed to provide full secondary treatment and sludge disposal
facilities, to deal with wastewater flows from the catchments of Jiluo, Daming Lake,
Liuhangtou and Huangtai. The plant was completed in 1995 (with financial support from



-70-                         ANNEX2
the Austrian Government), but is not yet operating because of lack of flow to the works.
The projected wastewater flows from the above four catchments are summarized as
follows:

15.   The proposed project would be the first tranche of a longer-term development
plan of wastewater investments, and would comprise the provision of sewer systems,
designed for a long-term planning horizon, in the four catchments of Jiluo, Daming,
Liuhangtou and Huangtai. The objectives are to: fully utilize the existing capacity of the
Jinan STW; improve the watercourses and natural environment in the city; protect
groundwater resources from pollution; reduce pollution of the Daming Lake; and improve
the water quality of Xiaoqing River. As indicated above, the second phase of this STW
would be built during 2001-15, meanwhile, excess flows would continue to spill over into
the Xiaoqing River.
16.   Proposed Wastewater Component ($36.5 million). The proposed component
would comprise the following works:
(a)    Construction of about 18 km of main interceptor, trunk sewers and force
mains in sizes about 600 to 2,000 mm diameter, inverted siphons and
ancillary facilities, including existing wastewater treatment plant
rehabilitation and commissioning.
(b)   Construction of about 17 km of secondary and link sewers of about 500 to
1,600 mm diameter, inverted siphons and ancillary facilities.
(c)    Construction of pump station of capacity about 100,000 m3/d for
wastewater and about 81,000 m3/day for storm  drainage, including
screens, pumping equipment and ancillary facilities.
(d)   Property connections throughout sewered area, in sizes to 300 mm
diameter, totaling about 3 km in length.

equipment.
(f)   Utility vehicles for operational use.
WEIHAI
17.   Weihai City, with a population of 438,000, has two thermal power plants that
supply heat and electricity. A new plant is required to meet demand in the south of the
city center in a developing industrial zone. Some of the steam load of the present
industry (40 tons/ hour) served by No. 1 and No. 2 plants can also be supplied from south
to vacate heat capacity (30 MW) for house heating in the city center.
18.   The plant would involve 3x75 tons/hour fluidized-bed boilers and two 12 MW
double-extraction turbogenerator sets.
19.   About 40 percent of capacity is reserved for residential heating corresponding to
about 20 percent of annual heat sales. The rest is supplied to industry. Since the southern
area of the city, where the plant is located, would, in the future, be the center of the city's
residential growth, the ratio is likely to change in the future in favor of residential load.
20.   Proposed Weihai District Heating Component ($42.9 million). The proposed
component would comprise the following works:
(a)   Combined Heat and Power Plant of about 24 MW  electricity and
120 MW heat capacity;
(b)   Heat and Steam Networks comprising about 13.7 km of steam network
of about 75 tons/hour * 1.0 Mpa capacity and hot water network of about
14.2 km of about 68 MW capacity;
(c)   Heat Exchanger Stations comprising about 10 stations of varying
capacity averaging about 6 MW.
YANTAI
21.   Yantai City has a population of 1.4 million people. The project would comprise
the construction of hot water distribution network in Zhifu District that is in the center of
the city. The network length would be 30 kIn, and it would serve 8.1 million M2 of
housing and public buildings connected to 41 heat substations. The capacity of the
system would be some 500 MW and annual heat sales some 770,000 Gal. The primary
network load density is thus some 17 MW/km.
22.   The main heat supply to the network would be from an existing power plant
owned and operated by Huang Bo-Hai Thermal Power Co. Ltd., a joint venture of three



-72-                      ANNEX2
parties: (a) Shandong Electric Power Bureau; (b) Yantai Municipality, and (c) a Hong
Kong-based investor group owned by the Bank of China.
23.   The power plant has three small old condensing turbines and two newly installed
100 MW (electrical) extraction-condensing turbines that would supply some 300 MW of
heat through a newly built main heat exchanger station.
24.   The project would also involve the installation of peak boilers near to the power
plant for peak load production.
25.   Proposed Yantai District Heating Component ($46.1 million). The proposed
component would comprise the following works:
(a)   Heating Network comprising about 30 km of pipework in sizes between
200 and 900 mm diameter, with a capacity of 500 MW;
(b)   Heat Exchanger Stations comprising about 42 stations of varying
capacities, averaging about 10 MW, and the main heat exchanger and
pumping station at the power plant;
(c)   Boiler Plant comprising boilers and associated equipment and facilities,
of about 112 MW capacity.
Xiaoqing River Basin Environmental Pollution Control Subloans Facility (XRBSL)
26.   Proposed Component ($10.0 million).  Environmental Pollution Control
Subloans would be made for environmental improvement measures of small- and
medium-size enterprises, located in the Xiaoqing River Basin. Projects under the subloan
fund would be restricted to a maximum of $1.0 million.
27.   Subloan processing and approvals would be covered by operational procedures
which are drafted. SEPB and SFB have established the Management Office, and the
China Investment Bank, Jinan branch, has been selected as the financial agent handling
appraisal of project proposals, procurement and disbursement of the subloans.
Institutional Strengthening, Construction Supervision and Training
28.   Proposed Component ($3.9 million). The component would comprise a number
of main composite packages for the various municipalities and agencies, covering
institutional development, construction supervision and training, as described below,
together with an allowance for support for provincial and sector city agencies, master
planning, and other programs of assistance to be further defined. Details are set out
below and in the Institutional Development, Financial Management Improvement,

ANNEX 6: LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT
ACTION PLAN
A. INTRODUCTION
1.    The Shandong Environment Project (SDEP) has four components, located in the
cities of Jinan, Weihai and Yantai and the XRB, which would involve land acquisition
and resettlement/rehabilitation of affected persons. To facilitate mitigation of the adverse
land acquisition-related impacts of the project and to comply with World Bank
requirements, the concerned implementing agency has prepared a comprehensive
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) for each.
2.    This annex describes the land acquisition and resettlement impacts of the project
and discusses the frameworks developed by the Provincial and Municipal Governments
for implementing and financing land acquisition and resettlement activities. Section B
describes the land acquisition and social impacts of the project and the surveys carried out
to verify impacts and identify resettlement issues. Section C sets out the implementation
frameworks for Land Acquisition and Resettlement. Project implementation would
commence in 1997 and continue to 2001.
B. PROJECT IMPACTS
3.    The following project components would require land acquisition and/or
resettlement/rehabilitation of affected persons:
Jinan City
(a)   Jinan Wastewater Collection;
(b)   Jinan Yellow River Water Supply;
Weihai City
(c)   Weihai District Heating; and
Yantai City
(d)   Yantai District Heating.
One component includes resettlement that would be implemented under retroactively-
financed contracts; the Jinan Wastewater Collection Project which has five annual stages,
the first being implemented in 1996. The Weihai District Heating Project involved site



- 96 -                    ANNEX6
acquisition and resettlement by the Weihai City Government in 1993 as part of suburban
development. This would be implemented early in the project. In 1995, the site was
chosen for the proposed Weihai No. 3 District Heating Plant, which is to be constructed
as part of the project. Both of these components would have resettlement action plans
which were submitted for review at appraisal, and found satisfactory.
4.    Construction of the new  project components requires land acquisition,
resettlement of the affected persons, rehabilitation of businesses and livelihoods, and
temporary disturbances during construction. In order to verify the impact of project
components on the affected people and property, each implementing agency conducted a
census of affected persons and properties and a socioeconomic sample survey of affected
households, including attitudinal questions.
Land Acquisition and Social Impacts
5.    The data set out here represent the situation as of January 31, 1997. Most of the
project components have been approved to the feasibility or preliminary engineering
stages. The feasibility study approval sets the parameters for land acquisition, following
which the implementing agencies can notify local government and the affected people.
This enables detailed implementation planning and public consultation to proceed prior to
project construction.
6.    Land acquisition and social impacts are summarized as follows.
(a)   The amount of land to be permanently requisitioned is 992 hectares
(14,879 mu);
(b)   18 hectares (266 mu) of land would be affected temporarily during
construction;
(c)   300 hectares (4,500 mu) of farmland would be temporarily acquired after
2015 for sediment deposition. The land would be acquired gradually and
would be returned to farmland after deposition is complete;
(d)   667 households (2,120 people) need to have their housing relocated;
(e)   An estimated 4,574 farmers (including dependents) would have their
livelihoods affected by land acquisition;
(f)   Investments in new land, agricultural improvements, sideline activities and
enterprise employment is planned to restore livelihoods and incomes.
Most of the agricultural persons can remain in agriculture through land
redistribution, but some laborers may need to be provided with
nonagricultural enterprise jobs; and



- 97 -                     ANNEX6
(g)   The project would affect 306 workers in 82 shops, until the shops can be
relocated. The project would also affect 25 enterprises and 217 of their
staff. Most staff would retain the same jobs after reconstruction; the
remainder would be assisted in gaining new employment.
Table 1 summarizes impacts for the four project subcomponents.
7.    Detailed baseline socioeconomic surveys of the affected people have been
completed by a local institute (Shandong University in Jinan). The baseline survey
measures the income levels and standards of living of the affected persons before land
acquisition and resettlement. This baseline survey forms the basis for comparing their
income levels and standards of living as would be reported by the monitoring reports
during project implementation.
Minimization of Land Acquisition and Resettlement
8.    The feasibility studies included an analysis of land acquisition and possible
resettlement, as part of the identification of project options. While the selection between
options was based on technical and economic criteria, the potential impact on project
affected persons was also considered.
(a)   In Weihai, a project site was selected in the urban fringe which had
already been zoned for industrial development. Land acquisition and
resettlement had already been successfully completed by the city
government in 1993.
(b)   In Yantai, the construction of the steam/heating pipeline has been routed
next to roadways to avoid acquisition of housing.
(c)   In Jinan, the Wastewater Collection Project involves the construction of
new underground sewers. These can be constructed along the road surface
without affecting adjacent buildings. However, certain segments (12.4 km
out of 50.9 km to be constructed) are along narrow roads that the city has
planned to widen for better urban transport corridors and redevelopment of
old city blocks. For these segments, a RAP has been prepared.
(d)   The Jinan Yellow River Water Supply Project involves the construction of
a storage reservoir. The proposed site (Queshan Reservoir) is in a flood
detention zone, and therefore affects fewer people and less arable farmland
than any comparable sites near Jinan.

C. FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT
ACTIVITIES
9.    Each RAP for the four project subcomponents with land acquisitions describes the
framework and action plans for implementing the land acquisition and resettlement
program. Each framework comprises the following elements:
(a)   Objectives and principles of land compensation and resettlement
(b)   Legal framework and resettlement policies
(c)   Resettlement institutions and agencies
(d)   Relocation of housing and compensation for personal assets
(e)   Compensation for lost income and plans for affected livelihoods
(f)   Costs and budget
(g)   Implementation schedule and arrangements for resettlement
(h)   Participation and consultation with affected persons
(i)   Redressal of grievance and appeals process
(j)    Monitoring and evaluation of RAP implementation.
10.   The four RAPs covering the above  components of the resettlement
implementation framework have been prepared by the implementing agencies based on
discussions with the concerned levels of government; the RAPs have been approved by
the concerned municipal authorities, and would be implemented as an integral part of the
project. The components of the framework for implementation are described below.
Objectives and Principles of Resettlement
11.   The main objective for each of the resettlement action plans is to ensure that the
standards of living and income levels of all categories of affected persons are improved,
or at least restored, after resettlement. The main principles for implementing the RAP are
as follows.
(a)   Minimize land acquisition and resettlement as much as possible through
choice of project components and changes in design and alignment.
(b)   Pay compensation for all structures at the replacement value of those
structures.
(c)   Pay compensation for collective land to the local collective.  This
compensation would be used to increase the productive capacity of the
collectives which in tum would rehabilitate incomes and livelihoods, and
would not be used for any other purpose.
(d)   Agencies may arrange some jobs in nonagricultural enterprises for some
persons whose lands are acquired. The majority of affected agricultural
people would remain in agricultural livelihoods.



-99 -                       ANNEX6
(e)   All infrastructure, such as municipal roads, communication, lighting,
sewerage, treatment work, etc. would be restored or replaced. The
concerned implementing agency would fully compensate for
reconstruction at replacement cost.
(f)    All affected enterprises would be compensated for any losses caused by
the project (i.e., disruption of their property) including related assets,
income and wages.
(g)   The implementing agencies would compensate persons affected by
temporary construction impacts to ensure their standards of living are not
adversely affected.
(h)   The implementing agencies would plan and carry out land acquisition and
resettlement activities with the participation of affected persons and their
representatives.
(i)    The affected persons or enterprises have avenues for redress of their
grievances and if they are not satisfied with the outcome, they can appeal
to higher authority and to civil courts.
(j)    For older people, special rehabilitation measures would be taken to ensure
that elderly affected persons are able to maintain their standards of living.
12.   The following guidelines and principles would be followed:
(a)   New houses of the affected persons would be of at least the same standard
as the affected houses or equal to the minimum current standards,
whichever is the greater;
(b)   All infrastructure affected would be restored or replaced at project cost; in
a manner which maintains or improves the quality of services;
(c)   All affected shops would be assisted by the implementing agencies to
resume operations at nearby locations;
(d)   Shop and enterprise workers would be provided with allowances
equivalent to their salaries for the period of closure; and
(e)   Planning and implementation of the RAPs would be carried out with the
participation of the affected persons and their representatives.
Legal Framework and Resettlement Policies
13.   The RAPs have been prepared based on the following laws, regulations and
guidelines for land acquisition and resettlement issued by various authorities in China:



-100 -                     ANNEX6
(a)   The People's Republic of China Land Management Law
(b)   The People's Republic of China Land Management Implementation Act
(c)   Rules of Land Acquisition for National Construction
(d)   Land Administration Implementation Measures of Shandong Province
(e)   Municipal regulations for land requisition and resettlement compensation.
14.   The implementation of land acquisition and resettlement program would be
carried out in accordance with the specific provisions of each subcomponent's RAP.
Compensation/Resettlement Policies for Different Categories of Project Impacts
15.   The following categories of project impacts were assessed during the census
survey of affected persons and properties:
(a)   Permanent land acquisition of collective land
(b)   Temporary disturbance/occupation of land during construction
(c)   Loss of housing
(d)   Households losing agricultural land and income
(e)   Relocation of shops and small businesses
(f)   Partial impacts on enterprises
(g)   Loss of standing crops
(h)   Indirect impacts in the disturbance zone.
16.   The RAPs provide full details of housing allocation and reconstruction options.
The compensation and/or resettlement policies for the above categories of impacts are as
follows.
(a)   Permanent Land Acquisition of Collective Land. The implementing
agency would pay compensation to the affected local government. The
rates have been provided in the RAP. The local governments would use
compensation payments to restore the productive capacity of the affected
villages through the development of agriculture-based and nonagriculture-
based economic activities.
(b)   Temporary Disturbance/Occupation of Land During Construction.
The implementing agency would compensate for temporary use based on
loss of net income from the land, including returns to labor. With this
compensation, the village officials would arrange the economic
rehabilitation and provide compensation directly to the persons
temporarily affected.
(c)   Loss of Housing.   Persons losing government-owned or private
apartments and houses would have the options of:
(i)    moving into a community-built house of the same standard as
previous house, without any extra payment; or



-101-                      ANNEX 6
(ii)   constructing a new house upon payment of compensation at
replacement value for the affected house or structure.  No
deductions would be made for depreciation.
(d)   Households Losing Agricultural Land and Income. All households
that lose income by land acquisition would be given the option of new
land, investment in other agricultural or sideline activities, or full-time
jobs in nonagricultural enterprises.
(e)   Relocation of Shops and Small Businesses. The implementing agency
and municipal land departments would assist business to find alternative
plots for continuing their businesses. Implementing agencies would
compensate such businesses for the replacement cost of the shop,
relocation costs and losses in net income during the period when their
business is closed.
(f)   Partial Impacts on Enterprises. The implementing agency would pay
the cost of restoration at full replacement value as compensation.
(g)   Loss of Standing Crops. Standing crops compensation would be paid
directly to the affected farmers at the full market value of comparable
mature crops at harvest.
(h)   Indirect Impacts in the Disturbance Zone. Indirect impacts due to the
construction of the project, on structures, businesses or people in the
disturbance zone would be compensated for physical loss at the full
Teplacement rates and/or net income loss. Structures needing repairs
would be compensated fully for the repairs. If any houses need to be
relocated due to such impact, they would be treated on the same lines as
houses affected by permanent land acquisition.
17.  In case it were found that the standards of living of any category of affected
persons have not been restored after relocation or resettlement, the implementing agency
would be responsible to take additional measures to ensure that the entitlements
stipulated by the RAP are achieved. Tables 2 to 5 summarize the categories of affected
people and their relevant entitlement, for each subcomponent.
Restoration of Household Incomes
18.   Most of the agricultural land to be acquired involves the Jinan Yellow River
Water Supply Project. Households (villages) that lose a small share of their household
incomes (less than 25 percent) can be allocated more land within the village and provided
compensation to improve production output on unaffected land or nonland-based income
generating activities. Households (villages) that lose most of their incomes (more than 75
percent) would be provided new land in a host village and some laborers would be
eligible for full-time nonagricultural jobs in enterprises. Households (villages) that lose a
significant share of their household incomes (25 to 75 percent) would restore livelihoods



-102-                     ANNEX6
and incomes through a combination of the above strategies. The income generation
schemes would guarantee that after resettlement household incomes are higher than
present income levels. During the transition period, food and income subsidies would be
provided by the implementing agency to maintain living standards. The transition period
would be minimized by proper scheduling of resettlement and project construction
activities. Job training would be provided for households that undertake new income-
generation activities. Also, such affected households would be eligible for preferential
policies that would be promulgated by the Jinan Municipal Government.
Resettlement Institutions and Agencies
19.   The Shandong Provincial Project Management Office (SPPMO) has vested
overall responsibility for coordination of planning and implementation of resettlement
activities with the project. SPPMO and the Municipal project offices in Jinan, Yantai and
Weihai are responsible for coordinating resettlement activities. The actual planning and
implementation of resettlement would be carried out by the borrower implementing
agencies, together with the township/district and village governments. In addition to
these, the main departments, bureaus and agencies responsible for various aspects of
resettlement planning, implementing, coordinating and monitoring resettlement activities
are the following:
(a)   The Planning Administration Office in each project city
(b)   The Shandong Provincial and Municipal Land administration Bureau for
Jinan, Yantai and Weihai
(c)   The Labor Bureau for Jinan, and Yantai
(d)   The Shandong Provincial and Municipal Urban and Rural Construction
Commissions for Jinan, Yantai and Weihai
(e)   Shandong Yellow River Management Office.
Costs and Budget
20.   The costs of RAP implementation is part of the overall budget of the project. The
annual requirement of funds would be included in the annual investment plan for the
project.  The base cost of land acquisition and resettlement is estimated to be
approximately Y 231.6 million ($27.9 million). The cost estimates by subcomponent are
shown in Table 6.
21.   The cost estimates would be adjusted based on the actual inflation rate. Physical
contingencies of 15 percent of the cost estimates have been budgeted. Each borrower
implementing agency is responsible for provision of adequate funds to carry out RAP
implementation. Cost overruns, if any, would be borne by each such agency.



-103-                      ANNEX6
Implementation Schedule
22.   The project subcomponents involving resettlement would be implemented
between 1996 and 2001, consistent with the overall project implementation schedule
shown in Anx 8. The RAPs have detailed implementation schedules and recommended
guidelines for project construction which minimize social impacts and enhance the
resettlement implementation program.  Assurances have been received from each
implementing agency that the RAP implementation would take precedence to the project
construction schedule in order to avoid unnecessary social impacts and related costs.
Participation and Consultations
23.   The RAPs have been developed with the active involvement of affected persons
and their representatives. The affected persons were informed about the project during or
after the feasibility studies were approved by the Municipal and Provincial Planning
Commissions. The affected persons and their representatives participated in the census
surveys carried out by each implementing agency and project office. Formal notifications
would be given to each affected household and business after the project is approved by
the Bank/IDA. The borrower agencies, assisted by local government have started to
inform the affected persons and households about the project components, the proposed
resettlement plans and the specific entitlements for each category of affected household
or business. The affected persons would participate in the following activities:
(a)   Selecting resettlement locations for residential sites and farmland;
(b)   Constructing their own houses (depending on their option);
(c)   Transferring their assets to the new houses;
(d)   Determining investment plans for restoration of incomes, production and
livelihoods;
(e)   Exercising the option of cash compensation for self-employment;
(f)   Recommending construction practices and schedules in order to minimize
income losses and social disturbances; and
(g)   Implementing  the  resettlement  program  through  their  village
representatives.
Resettlement Information Booklet
24.   Resettlement Information Booklets are being prepared for each project
component. The booklets would have a common section dealing with overall regulations
and principles and a section laying out the resettlement arrangements specific to each
affected area and category of impact. The booklet would be given to each affected person
to ensure adequate knowledge of their rights under the project and avenues of appeal.



-104-                      ANNEX6
Grievances and the Appeals Process
25.  In order to ensure that the affected persons have avenues for redressing their
grievances, detailed procedures for redressal of grievances have been established. Many
grievances can be handled by the implementing agency but if this not successful, an
affected person can initiate the formal process. First, the affected person could lodge a
grievance with the township Land Management Office, to which the Office should
respond within 15 days. Second, if the person is not satisfied, an appeal would be made
to a department within the District Government within a specified time. Third, if still
unsatisfied, the affected person could appeal to a department within the Municipal
Government for redressing the grievance. Finally, an appeal can be lodged with the
People's court within 15 days of receiving the decision from the Municipal level. The
grievance could be for any aspect of the RAP program, including rates of compensation.
Grievance mechanisms would be included in the Resettlement Information Booklet.
Monitoring and Evaluation
26.  In order to ensure that the implementation of resettlement would be in accordance
with the provisions of the RAPs, detailed monitoring and evaluation, both internal and
external, would be carried out during and after implementation of the project.
(a)   Internal Monitoring.  Each implementing agency is responsible for
internal monitoring of the RAP. This would be coordinated by SPPMO.
Monitoring would be carried out based on the provisions of the RAP. The
main indicators to be monitored are payment of compensation, allotment
of housing, restoration of livelihoods, allowances for workers lost wages,
relocation of shops, and restoration of enterprises.  The internal
monitoring reports would be prepared every three months for submission
to SPPMO. Preliminary monitoring formats have been prepared. An
internal monitoring report would be submitted to the Bank/IDA every six
months. The first internal monitoring report would be submitted on
March 31, 1997.
(b)   External Monitoring.  Independent institutes specializing in social
assessment would be contracted to conduct external monitoring and
evaluation of the RAPs. In addition to verifying the results of the internal
monitoring reports, these institutes would monitor the following
performance indicators: (i) timeliness and adequacy of compensation
payments; (ii) land acquisition and relocation; (iii) timely restoration of
livelihoods and income-generation activities; (iv) adequate restoration of
infrastructure; (v) restoration of shops and enterprises; (vi) provision of
housing; (vii) levels of satisfaction among the affected persons;
(viii) income levels and standards of living after relocation; (ix) level of
public participation; (x) effectiveness of resettlement management;
(xi) redressal of grievances; and (xii) follow-up for problem resolution.



-105-                     ANNEX6
27.   The External Monitoring and Evaluation Reports would be prepared by these
institutes every six months, until construction of all subcomponents is completed. The
first external monitoring report would be submitted to the Bank/IDA on June 30, 1997.
The report would review the adequacy of implementation measures and report on the
perceptions of the affected persons.  It would also identify critical issues in
implementation and make recommendations to improve overall effectiveness of the
resettlement program. The report would also report progress of follow-up action that was
to be initiated on the recommendations of previous monitoring reports. The agency
responsible for each subcomponent would negotiate a contract for external monitoring.
Two acceptable candidates include Shandong University and the Shandong Academy of
Social Sciences.

ANNEX 7: ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    Shandong is located in the northeast of China and is bordered to the north by
Hebei Province, to the south by Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces, to the east by the Bohai
Sea and to the west by Hebei and Henan Provinces. The province covers an area of
157,000 km2 and has a population of 87 million (1995 data), of which the urban
population accounted for 32 percent. The population growth rate is 0.38 percent. Jinan,
the provincial capital, has a total population of 5.37 million, of which the urban area
population is 2.43 million, and is one of the major industrial centers of the province,
accounting for about 10 percent of its GDP.
2.   Industrial sectors represented in Jinan include steel, machinery, metals, textiles,
food, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Industrial growth in Jinan has been rapid, with
output rising in real terms by a factor of 2.5 between 1986 and 1994. Other major cities
in Shandong include Qingdao, Dongying, Zibo, Weihai and Yantai. Each of these cities
has a per capita GDP in the highest 10 percent of all cities in China, although that of
Jinan is the lowest of the major cities in Shandong. The rapid growth in the major cities
in Shandong has resulted in serious environmental problems, in particular in relation to
air pollution.
3.    The Xiaoqing River Basin (XRB) covers an area of approximately 16,992 km2
and a population in the order of 9 million, some 10 percent of the provincial total. The
basin is an important agricultural and industrial production base for Shandong Province,
accounting for one-fifth of the provincial GDP.
4.    Rapid industrial growth in the Xiaoqing basin has led to a major decline in water
quality, and pollution in the Basin poses threats to health and to economic development.
Increasingly there are reports of unsafe drinking water, and contamination of Laizhou
Bay threatens the key seafood industry of Shandong, to which there has already been
substantial damage.
5.    Weihai and Yantai are both located in the northeastern part of the Shandong
peninsula on the Yellow Sea coast. Weihai has a population of 2.4 million, of which
420,000 are urban; the urban center includes industrial areas and the suburban population
is mainly engaged in agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture. A high-tech industrial zone is
planned for the southern part of the city. Yantai is an important port city with a
population of 6.3 million including 1.4 million in the urban area. The city is rich in
natural resources and has major outputs of gold, talcum, marble and a range of
agricultural products, particularly apples, of which it is among the leading producers in



-114-                      ANNEX7
China. It is an important tourism center and has major sea fishery and aquaculture
operations.
Administrative and Institutional Framework
6.    The State Environmental Protection Committee (SEPC) is the highest level of
authority on environmental policy and includes the State Council and heads of all
relevant ministries and agencies. NEPA functions as the secretariat of SEPC and is
responsible for all aspects of environmental policy although it shares authority with other
agencies for certain natural resources. NEPA sets overall policies and regulations
governing the provincial and municipal EPBs, and implementation of environmental
policy is through the municipal and provincial EPBs, who are responsible for the
maintenance of environmental quality.
7.    The Shandong Provincial Govermnent has accorded priority to the cleanup of the
XRB and, accordingly, established in 1994 the Xiaoqing River Basin Environmental
Management Commission to develop and implement a long-term strategy to improve the
condition of the river. In addition to pollution control, the strategy addresses flood
control, irrigation, navigation, aquatic production and tourism.
Project Description
8.    The proposed project comprises a total of six components as follows:
(a)   Jinan Wastewater Collection System-construction of about 38 km of
trunk and secondary sewer networks to permit utilization of the capacity
(220 000 m3/day) of the existing wastewater treatment plant;
(b)   Jinan Water Supply-facilities for abstraction of water (up to 9.6 M3!
second) from the existing irrigation intake on the Yellow River, storage in
a new reservoir of capacity 46 million m3 and to transfer to existing water
treatment plants;
(c)   Weihai District Heating-construction of a new CHP plant of capacity
24 MW electricity and 120 MW heat, about 17 km of steam and 13 km of
hot water distribution networks, and 10 heat exchange stations;
(d)   Yantai District Heating-provision of 30 km of heating network, 42 heat
exchange stations and peak boiler plant of capacity about 112 MW;
(e)   Xiaoqing Basin Industrial Pollution Control Subloan Facility; and
(f)   Technical Assistance and Training.
Of these components only (a) to (d) involve physical works in the immediate term and are
therefore covered by this Environmental Assessment (EA). Separate EA reports were



-115 -                     ANNEX7
prepared for each component, which then were synthesized into a comprehensive project-
wide EA report.
Baseline Data
9.    Shandong is the second largest province in China and has the third largest
aggregate GDP; the per capita GDP is Y 5,747, approximately 1.5 times the national
average and the seventh highest of the provinces (excluding the three province status
cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin). Contributions to the GDP from agriculture,
industry and the tertiary sector are 20.2, 47.4 and 32.4 percent, respectively. The gross
agricultural output of Shandong is the highest of any province in China and the gross
industrial output ranks second after that of Jiangsu.
10.   Some 64 percent of the area of the province is mountainous or hilly and forest
cover is 20 percent. The province includes eight major lakes and nine major rivers, of
which the most important is the Huang He (Yellow River), which in the western part of
the province forms the boundary with Hebei. Water resources in the province average
200 m3/capita.
11.   The energy needs of the province are met almost entirely by coal, which is of
variable quality, with sulfur contents sometimes in excess of 2.5 percent. As a result
Shandong has the highest emissions (in mass terms) of SO2 of any of the provinces in
China.
Climate
12.   The climate of Shandong is classified as temperate monsoon; rainfall is low,
annual averages being between 550 and 950 mm, and concentrated in summer. Annual
average temperatures range between 11 and 14 C, temperatures decreasing from northeast
to southwest. The coldest month is January, with average temperatures ranging from -4
to 1 C, and the hottest month is July, with average temperatures between 24 and 27 C.
The average number of frost-free days ranges from 180 to 220 per year.
13.   The Xiaoqing River originates in the west of Jinan, the Provincial capital, and
flows a distance of 237 km, passing through a total of 5 cities and 18 towns, villages and
counties, before discharging to the Bohai Sea in Laizhou Bay in eastern Shandong.
Average annual rainfall in the basin is 619.5 mm, concentrated principally in the wet
season (July to September), which accounts for 50 to 60 percent of the total annual
rainfall. The mean flow in the Xiaoqing is 40.3 m3/second; much of the rainfall in the
basin recharges the shallow and deep aquifers that underlie the region.
14.   Both Weihai and Yantai have a continental monsoon climate, with annual average
temperatures of 12.3 and 13 C, respectively. Annual rainfall in the two cities averages
777 mm and 613 mm, respectively, the majority of which in each case occurs in summer.
The prevailing wind direction in Weihai is northwest and between south-southwest and



-116-                       ANNEX7
west-southwest in Yantai; average annual wind velocities are 5.6 m/second and 3.6 m/
second, respectively.
Water and Air Quality Standards
15.   The water quality standards appropriate in respect of water quality in the Xiaoqing
basin are those of the national Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Waters
(GB 3838-88). The National Standard defines water quality standards applicable to five
different classes of surface water with designated uses ranging from national nature
reserves (Class I); municipal water supply and fisheries protection (Class II); water
supply after treatment and recreation involving contact (e.g., swimming) (Class III);
industrial water supply and noncontact recreation (Class IV) to agriculture and industrial
cooling water (Class V). The mainstream Xiaoqing River is currently very heavily
polluted, with concentrations of some pollutants being more than 10 times the maximum
concentration allowed by the least stringent classification, Class V.
16.   The national ambient air quality standards (GB 3095-82) specify different air
quality standards for different classifications of land use.  The standards specify
maximum annual average, maximum daily average and maximum instantaneous
concentrations of SO2, TSP and NO, for three categories of land use;
(a)   Class I: Tourist, historic, conservation and sanitarium areas;
(b)   Class II: Urban residential, cultural and rural areas and places of historic
interest;
(c)   Class III: Industrial districts and heavy traffic areas.
Class I areas are designated by the State Government and Class II and III areas by locals
government.
17.   Xiaoqing River Basin Water Quality. Industrial development in the Xiaoqing
basin has caused a major decline in water quality, and the river is now in effect a
wastewater canal. The present total wastewater flow discharged to the Xiaoqing and its
tributaries is approximately 12.5 m3/second, of which 7.5m3/second are derived from
industry. Thus the dilution available for this wastewater is only a factor of about 3 on
even an annual average basis and much lower during the dry season. As a result
concentrations of COD exceed 200 mg/l, some 10 times even the least stringent Class V
standard, and dissolved oxygen is present only at the source and in minimal
concentrations in the lower reaches. A range of toxic or persistent organic chemicals
have been identified in the mainstream Xiaoqing.
18.   The main sources of pollution of the Xiaoqing are industrial wastewater
discharges and urban wastewater from a number of cities and counties, principally Jinan,
Zibo, Binzhou and Weifang, and from the Qilu petrochemicals complex, which is located
close to Zibo but discharges wastewater via a 60 km pipeline into the Xiaoqing close to



-117-                      ANNEX7
the outlet to Laizhou bay. The pollution loads to the Xiaoqing are shown in Table 1
below.
TABLE 1: POLLUTION LOADS TO THE XIAOQING RIVER
(tons/year)
Reach                           Total COD Load         Industrial COD Load
Jinan                               153,867                   122,714
Zibo                                117,864                   97,140
Binzhou                              31,216                    28,845
Dongying                             25,434                   24,826
Qilu Petrochemical                    8,848                    8,848
Weifang                              56,807                   53,983
TOTAL                            394,036                   336,356
19.   The industrial wastewater COD load, in total accounting for approximately 85
percent of the overall total load, is dominated by the loads associated with wastewaters
from two sectors of industry. The major polluting industry sector is the manufacture of
paper using straw as the raw material from which the pulp is produced. This sector
generates an aggregate COD load of approximately 211,000 tons/year, some 63 percent
of the total industrial COD load to the Xiaoqing and more than 50 percent of the overall
total COD load. The other important polluting sector is food and beverage production,
pollution from which is dominated by wastewaters from wineries and distilleries. The
sector in total accounts for 27 percent of the industrial COD load and 23 percent of the
overall load. Thus, these two sectors in aggregate account for more than 75 percent of the
overall load to the Xiaoqing and its tributaries and clearly these sectors must be a key
focus of any pollution control program for the Xiaoqing basin.
20.   These overall COD loads are extremely high, given the very limited water flows
in the Xiaoqing. The total COD load of 394,036 tons/year is equivalent to an average
concentration (based on the annual average flow of 40.3 m3/second and neglecting self-
purification) in the order of 300 mg/l. Such concentrations are understood to be
consistent with those measured in the upper reaches of the river in the Jinan region.
21.   A major factor affecting water quality in the upper reaches of the Xiaoqing is the
inadequate sewerage system in Jinan. A major wastewater treatment plant (with a
capacity of 220,000 m3/day) has been constructed, but this treatment capacity cannot be
utilized because of sewerage system deficiencies, which means that all Jinan wastewater
flows remain untreated.
22.   For the purposes of water quality management in the basin, the Xiaoqing River
has been divided into four main reaches-Jinan; Zibo-Binzhou; Dongying; and Weifang,
and 17 river sections. The former two reaches constitute the nontidal portion of the river,



-118 -                        ANNEX7
a total river length of 166 km, and the latter two (a total of 71 km) the tidal estuary. The
long-term (2000-10) water quality objectives for the Xiaoqing are as follows:
Water Quality Classification
Reach                        (GB 3838-88)
Jinan                             IV
Zibo-Binzhou                      III
Dongying-Weifang                  II
23.   Shandong EPB has made estimates of the assimilative capacity of the Xiaoqing,
based on a water quality model developed by the Shandong Environmental Protection
Design Institute (SEPDI) for dry-season flow conditions. Based on these estimates, the
EPB has also made preliminary estimates of the degrees of reduction in COD loads
entering the river that would be necessary to achieve the water quality objectives. The
projected and allowable COD loads for the year 2010 are as follows:
2010 COD Load to River Reach (tons/year)
Jinan      Zibo-Binzhou      Dongying-Weifang       Total
Projected /a            114,066        35,020               65,540          245,153
Allowable                 8,424         2,662                3,277           14,363
La Taking account of self purification and deposition in tributaries and lakes, the benefit of this may in
practice be less than expected because of resuspension of polluted material from the river bed during
the first rains following dry periods.
24.   These figures imply a need to reduce loads by more than 90 percent by 2010. In
practice, as may be seen from Table 1 above, the present total point source COD loads
before treatment are already in the order of 400,000 tons/year.
25.   The magnitude of the water pollution problems and the limited water resources of
the XRB highlight the importance of control of wastewater discharges on the basis of
pollution loads rather than solely on simple concentration-based discharge standards.
This has been recognized in the case of the Xiaoqing Basin for some years and the basin
was selected by NEPA in 1987 to participate along with 17 cities (including Jinan and
Zibo) in the trial implementation of a discharge permit system.
26.   This has had limited effectiveness, however, because the permit system adopted
by the Shandong EPB was goal rather than capacity-based. The EPB established short-
and medium-term goals for reductions in pollution discharges in Jinan, Zibo and the Qilu
Petrochemical Industrial Area based on the pollution loads from these areas. A greater
reduction was required of areas that contributed a greater proportion of the total load,
where economic conditions were better or where technical resources were available. In



-119-                      ANNEX7
particular, 37 enterprises discharging more than 85 percent of the COD load from Jinan
were required by the Jinan EPB to register the details of their discharges.
27.   The system has not achieved the desired effect for a number of other reasons,
including its application only to existing discharges. As a consequence pollution loads
have continued to increase in spite of the fact that wastewater volumes and COD loads
discharged per unit of industrial output (at constant prices) each declined by more than a
factor of 3 between 1986 and 1994.
28.   It has also been appreciated that to achieve pollution load reduction targets it
would necessary for industry to change to cleaner production processes. To implement
management strategies for pollution prevention and control in the Xiaoqing basin, the
Shandong Provincial Government has issued an order that seriously polluting industries
would be ordered to close, cease production or comply with pollution control within
deadlines. This pollution control may take the form either of end-of-pipe treatment or the
introduction of cleaner production technologies involving lower levels of pollution.
29.   Weihai and Yantai Air Quality. Weihai was designated the first Chinese
"Clean City" in 1990, but atmospheric pollution is increasing as a result of the rising use
of coal for domestic purposes and increasingly as a fuel for industry. Total coal
consumption in Weihai is currently in the order of 900,000 tons/year; and typical sulfur
contents of the coal are in the order of 1.7 percent. Apart from a small area in the city
center air quality in Weihai is Class II or better and that in the southern part of the city is
Class I. However, it is expected that the proposed industrial development in the high-
tech zone would cause a decline in air quality in this area to Class II and also a further
decline in the city center.
30.   Although more than 95 percent of the population of the city proper of Yantai use
gas as a domestic fuel, consumption of coal (with sulfur contents typically in the order of
1.2 percent) exceeds 1.5 million tons/year, the majority of which is consumed by
industry. As a result air quality (in terms of SO2 concentrations) is currently Class III in
an area of about 18 km2 and fails to meet even this standard in a further 12 km2 in the
center of the city.
Consideration of Alternatives
31.   For all components the concepts represent the only practical solutions. Where a
range of detailed options was available, the proposals adopted were those meeting the
required objectives at least cost.
Environmental Benefits
32.   The Project involves components aimed at substantially reducing discharges of
pollution to the XRB and to the atmosphere.  Accordingly, the balance of the
environmental impact of the project is substantially positive and the positive



-120 -                     ANNEX7
environmental benefits greatly outweigh the negative impacts. Environmental benefits of
the project components are described below.
33.   Jinan Wastewater Collection. The provision of enhanced wastewater collection
facilities in Jinan would result in the collection and subsequent treatment of a wastewater
flow of 220,000 m3/day, some 46 percent of the total urban wastewater flow. Treatment
of this flow would reduce the COD load from Jinan urban wastewater by 32,120
tons/year, some 20 percent of the total COD load to the Xiaoqing from the Jinan region,
with substantial reductions in the loads of other pollutants.
34.   This component would reduce the COD  concentration in the Xiaoqing
downstream of Jinan by almost 100 mg/l (approximately 45 percent), albeit only to a
level in excess of 130 mg/I, still more than six times even the Class V standard.
35.   Jinan Water Supply Intake. This component would sustain the use of the
Yellow River as a water resource for Jinan during the dry season and would reduce the
dependence on groundwater.  Groundwater is currently being abstracted at an
unsustainable rate in terms of its recharge; as a result the quality of groundwater is
declining, and the continued abstraction of groundwater in Jinan, with the associated
reduction in groundwater levels, threatens the flow of water in the springs for which Jinan
is famous. The scheme would yield a supply of approximately 400,000 m3/day, resulting
in an improvement in the quality of water entering supply serving a population of some
1 million.
36.   Weihai District Heating. The proposed No. 3 Thermal Power Plant in Weihai
would provide district heating and process steam for the developing high-tech industrial
zone in the south of the city, thereby substituting 29 existing boilers and avoiding the
provision of any new boilers and household heating stoves in the zone. This would result
in significant savings in coal consumption as a consequence of both economies of scale
and enhanced thermal efficiency of heat supply, with associated benefits of reduced
emissions of SO2 and TSP. These emissions would be reduced still further by the fact
that the combustion process employed at the power plant is a fluidized-bed system with
injection of limestone to remove SO2; in addition, the impact of the emissions at ground
level is further reduced by their discharge through a tall (100 m) stack compared with the
existing discharges from independent boilers and stoves at very close to ground level.
37.   As a consequence of these reductions in emissions, there would be significant
improvements in air quality both in the high-tech industrial zone and elsewhere in the
city. The environmental improvements associated with the project are shown in Table 2.
38.   Yantai District Heating. The proposed conversion of the Yellow Sea and Bohai
Sea Thermal Power Co. Ltd. power plant to a CHP system for extending district heating
in Yantai would replace about 200 existing boilers and 64,000 household stoves and
avoid the provision of any new such facilities. Coal consumption in the city is expected
to increase by almost 25 percent between 1994 and 2000, with associated worsening of
air quality.



-121-                           ANNEX7
39.    The project would reduce the growth in coal consumption to one-third this level
and would reduce emissions of SO2 and TSP by a corresponding amount. There would
be greater improvements in ground level air quality as a result of the discharge of
emissions from the peak heat supply boilers associated with the project via a tall stack
(100 m). The environmental benefits of the Yantai District Heating component are given
in detail in Table 2.

Notes: 1. All benefits are expressed relative to the 2000 No Project case.
2. The relatively low reduction in coal use in Weihai in relation to the reductions in emissions is
due to the improved heating levels provided by the new facility and to the flue gas
desulfurization by limestone injection at the power plant.
3. The net increase in the area of Yantai in Class II is accounted for by the elimination of air
quality worse than Class III and reductions in the Class III area, air quality in each case being
improved to Class II.
4. N.a.-not applicable-no areas in Weihai would have air quality worse than Class III even in
the no project case.
Impacts and Mitigation
40.    Although the impact of the project is on balance  substantially  positive,
nevertheless, negative impacts have been identified in the EA process for all components
that require detailed analysis and mitigation measures. The principal impacts for each of
the individual project components are described below.
Jinan Wastewater Collection
41.    Construction Phase. The construction impact of the Jinan wastewater collection
project would be almost entirely during the construction phase. Excavation for the
installation of about 38 km of sewers would result in substantial quantities of spoil
material; however, the majority of this material would be used in other construction
projects in Jinan. A detailed spoil disposal plan would be prepared. Other impacts of the
project during construction include noise, dust and disruption to traffic and other urban
services. The impact would be reduced to the minimum practicable by controls on
construction practice.
42.    Sludge Disposal. The principal objective of the wastewater collection component
is to facilitate the effective use of the existing wastewater treatment plant, which is
currently limited by sewerage system deficiencies. When operating at design throughput,
the wastewater treatment plant would generate a total of some 53 tons (as dry solids) of



-122 -                      ANNEX7
sludge daily. Sludge would be appropriately treated and safely disposed principally
through codisposing to municipal sanitary landfills.
Jinan Water Supply Intake
43.   Resettlement. This project requires substantial land acquisition, both temporary
and permanent, totaling in excess of 8 km2 and resettlement of a total of 1,186 persons.
These issues are discussed in detail in Annex 6.
44.   Downstream Impact. The proposed mode of operation of the facility envisages
an abstraction of 9.65 m3/second during the highest flow period of July-September and of
8.65 m3/second during the remainder of the year. At some times of the year, it may not
be possible to sustain such an abstraction rate without adverse impact upon downstream
water uses or water quality. Under such conditions, abstraction rates would reduce or
abstraction would be suspended.
45.   Construction Phase. During construction, there would be a number of impacts
such as noise, dust, construction traffic and disruptions to land use and services; these
would be minimized, wherever possible, by using environmentally responsive
construction specifications, controls on construction practice through adequate site
supervision and by carefully scheduling construction operations. In particular, there
would be disruption to the road from Jinan to Dezhou; a temporary replacement road
would be constructed.
46.   Seepage Control. Groundwater in the area of the proposed reservoir is relatively
shallow and there is concern that leakage from the base of the reservoir could result in
rising groundwater levels and possibly even waterlogging of soils. In view of the high
evaporation rates, there is concern also in respect of salinization of soils. Two methods
of leakage control are therefore proposed. The reservoir would be lined with geotextile
membranes with appropriate blockwork protection and, in addition, a system of leakage
collection and discharge ditches would be constructed.
47.   Dredged Material Disposal.  The Yellow  River carries high silt loads,
particularly during high flow periods; silt loads contained in the water abstracted have
been estimated at almost 1.2 million m3 annually. Accordingly, it would be necessary to
remove silt from the water before it enters the reservoir to avoid capacity loss by siltation,
and a dedicated sedimentation basin is provided for this purpose. This sedimentation
basin would require dredging at intervals to sustain its operation. The dredged material
would be moved to a stockyard area where it would be kept moist to prevent dispersal of
fine sand material and covered to generate new agricultural areas. The Yellow River
Basin authorities and JMSC have built up extensive experience with the removal,
handling, and environmentally safe management of this silt.
48.   Control of Eutrophication.  Data for nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus)
concentrations in the Yellow River indicate that the reservoir could be eutrophic.
Concentrations in the River are particularly high during the period when flows increase as



-123 -                      ANNEX7
a result of the first rains after prolonged dry periods (particularly at the beginning of the
wet season). It is proposed, as far as possible (resource considerations permitting), to
control nutrient loads entering the reservoir by restricting abstractions under these flow
conditions. In the reservoir, optimum levels for nitrogen and phosphorus are determined
to be 0.6 and 0.04 mg/l, respectively.
Weihai and Yantai District Heating
49.   Air Pollution Control. The principal impact of the district heating components
is the generation of boiler slag and fly ash residues. The ash contents of the coals used in
the cities are typically about 25 percent. Although in each case there is a substantial net
decrease in coal consumption, in all cases there would be a concentration of coal
consumption at a large facility rather than small-scale use at a large number of small
individual boilers and stoves. Thus, large amounts of residues would require disposal
from these facilities, and in the case of the Jinan and Weihai, the residues would contain
the products of flue gas desulfurization. It is proposed to use all residues from the power
plants and boilers in the manufacture of building materials at enterprises located nearby.
To minimize problems of dust during storage and transport of these residues, conveyors
would be covered and stockpiles would be kept moist.
50.   SPG  would, in parallel, undertake boiler upgrading and energy efficiency
programs to reduce SO2 and TSP emissions in Weihai and Yantai. This is expected to
contribute to overall air quality improvement.
51.   The power stations and boilers are located in urban areas, and in some cases, it
would be necessary to provide noise insulation and attenuation measures to ensure
compliance with urban noise standards. The construction of the distribution systems for
steam and hot water would generate spoil from excavation. However, given the general
pipework sizes it is not expected that quantities of excess spoil would be substantial.
52.   The impacts and their associated mitigation measures are listed in Table 3.

ANNEX 12: ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION PREVENTION
AND CONTROL
Introduction
1.    Shandong's industrial growth of nearly 17 percent per year over the past five
years has been accompanied by increasing discharges of wastewater, solid waste, and air
pollutants. An increasingly strict environmental regulatory regime has held waste
discharges below the overall growth rate, but wastewater and air polluting discharges
have still grown some 7 percent per year. Naturally, the impact of this growth varies with
location, industrial concentration and type of effluent. The candidate cities for the
Shandong Environment Project have the largest concentrations of industry, and some of
the most highly polluting, in the province: Jinan and Zibo industry discharges to the
Xiaoqing River, which is experiencing declining absorptive capacity, virtually rendering
it unusable for agriculture or fisheries.
2.   In the province as a whole, the pulp and paper industry remains the worst polluter,
responsible for 58 percent of all industrial water pollution and providing 20 of the top 45
polluters. Next comes the alcohol industry, with 19 percent of wastewater, and 1 1 of the
top 45 polluters. The metallurgy industry ranks third, with one company representing 3
percent of total industrial pollution. Other top polluters include a variety of chemical and
refinery plants.
3.    The XRB provides one measure of the relative impact of environmental pollution.
The water pollution in the river is mainly caused by organic pollutants, with serious
consequences for beneficial uses of the river. The point source pollution in the Basin
represents 94.8 percent of the total pollution load. About 85.4 percent is from industries
and 14.6 percent from urban sewage. The nonpoint pollution, while only 5.2 percent of
the pollution load, is nevertheless still significant.
4.    Analysis of pollution sources and abatement costs in Shandong demonstrates the
relatively low cost of addressing some pollutants at source. A significant reduction of
industrial COD, for example, is estimated to cost about Y 858 million investment. Some
281,400 kg COD would be removed by treating 173 million m3 wastewater a year. The
Environmental Pollution Control component of the project addresses these industrial
point sources.
5.    The component relies on a two-part strategy: (a) lending for a number of smaller
pollution prevention and control investments through a Xiaoqing River Basin Subloans



-136-                     ANNEX12
Facility (XRBSL), to be capitalized at $10 million, utilizing $5 million of proceeds of the
Bank loan, and an equal amount of local currency; and (b) action plans for the cleanup of
the Basin. This annex discusses in turn each part of the strategy.
Environmental Policy in Shandong Province
6.   In May 1988, the Implementation Plan for Pollution Prevention and Treatment in
the XRB was approved by the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee. It
prioritized four actions:
* treating 31 high-polluting enterprises;
* construction of two municipal wastewater treatment plants in Jinan and Zibo;
* improving water quality by transferring water from the Yellow River and
Mada Lake;
v providing good quality drinking water in the seriously polluted areas.
So far 12 of the 31 enterprises have treated their wastewater discharge, the wastewater
treatment plant in Zibo (140,000 tons/day) is completed and in Jinan (220,000 tons/day)
is nearly completed, the Yellow River is contributing, on average, 1.5 m3/second of water
and drinking water is provided now to 360,000 people by drilling 237 deep wells and
building 10 oxidation ponds.
7.    At the end of 1995 and during 1996, Shandong Province issued new regulations to
strengthen water pollution prevention and control:
3 Notice on the Establishment of a Special Fund for Controlling Pollution
Generated from Pulp and Paper Enterprises, Breweries and Distilleries, No.
19.  This document requires enterprises producing pulp and paper,
monosodium glutamate (MSG), citric acid and alcoholic beverages to
contribute to a special fund, based on their annual production output, as long
as the concentration of pollutants in their wastewater exceeds the national
standards;
* Decision on Strengthening Water Pollution Prevention and Control, No. 31.
It sets a timetable for wastewater discharge control, indicating that by the end
of 1997 the key polluting industries located along the river basin should be in
compliance with national standards and by the end of 2000, all industrial
pollution sources should meet the standards; and,
* Provisional Measures for Collecting the Urban Wastewater Fee in Shandong
Province, No. 52. This document mandates the collection of urban wastewater
treatment fees from working units and individuals, located in the service area,



-137-                      ANNEX 12
to cover the construction, operating and maintenance costs of the centralized
treatment plants.
Pollution Fee Collection and Use in Shandong Province
8.    As one means of providing technical and financial assistance to help polluters to
bring their discharges within the pennitted loads, a 1982 Chinese environmental law
provided for the establishment of provincial, municipal and county environmental funds
financed by pollution levies. The levies originally provided grants for pollution control
investments in industrial and municipal projects, and 20 percent was earmarked for EPB
environmental monitoring and enforcement activities. A 1988 amendment to the law
stipulated that up to 50 percent of the fund income was to be loaned rather than granted to
enterprises in Shandong, and in 1990 SPG ruled that the fund could no longer provide
grants to industry, thereby enhancing the Polluter Pays Principle. By the end of 1994, the
total amount of loans made to enterprises was Y 449 million, implementing 1,064 projects
for pollution treatment and control.
9.   In Shandong, municipal and county EPBs collect pollution levy fees, while the
provincial, municipal and county EPBs jointly plan fee collection and utilization. The
finance bureau at each level of government holds the revenue collected, and disburses it
via local branches of the People's Construction Bank of China according to a fund
allocation plan provided by the EPBs.
10.   Fee rates have been established for wastewater discharges, waste gas emissions,
solid waste disposal and noise pollution. Fee collections rose from Y 19 million in 1991
to over Y 33 million in 1995, with over 70 percent of the collected fees used for industrial
pollution control and the remainder financing the EPBs' environmental monitoring and
enforcement work.
Environmental Policy for the Xiaoqing River Basin
11.  In 1988, a special organization was established by SPG-the Xiaoqing River
Basin Environmental Management Commission. It has no office of its own, but under its
leadership are two organizations with full-time staff:
*  the Xiaoqing River Basin Environment Leadership Group within the
Provincial Planning Commission, whose tasks are to compile comprehensive
plans for environmental management in the river basin and to coordinate
between the government agencies involved in the implementation of these
plans;
* the Xiaoqing River Basin Environmental Management Office within SEPB,
whose tasks, within the river basin, are to develop environmental regulations,
monitoring and inspecting environmental programs, enforcement and
participating in the development of comprehensive plans for environmental
management.



-138-                      ANNEX 12
12.   As a result of a law (Luzhengfa, No. 42, 1995) passed by SPG, some companies
have been closed, while 45 provincial enterprises and 55 enterprises below the provincial
level have been ordered to reduce their emissions before the end of 1997. The estimated
impact is a reduction of daily discharge of COD of 220 tons.
Pollution Fee Collection and Use in the Xiaoqing River Basin
13.   For the Xiaoqing River Basin area, the money collected from pollution levies is
shared between 24 accounts: 5 municipal EPBs, 18 county EPBs and the provincial EPB,
where it is mixed with levies from all other parts of the province. Per year, the 23
sublevel EPBs deal with a total of Y 130 million used specifically for pollution control
while, at provincial level, Y 40 million (1995) are available for the whole province. The
pollution levy funds of the municipalities along the river basin, that is Jinan, Zibo,
Weifang, Dongying and Binzhou, total Y 136 million. Y 76 million is used for
wastewater treatment.
14.   The Special Fund for Controlling Pollution Generated from Pulp and Paper
Enterprises, Breweries and Distilleries, mentioned above, would only contribute to
pollution control investments. The total amount that is collected by the Light Industries
Bureaus and the TVIE Management Bureaus would be returned to enterprises. The fees
are Y 100 per ton of pulp; Y 50 per ton of alcohol, MSG and citric acid; and Y 20 per ton
of beer based on annual output.
15.   Bank Group Experience in China with Environmental Funds. China still has
limited experience with environmental loan funds. The Bank Group has supported the
establishment of such funds under seven different projects and three of them have been in
operation for at least one year. Compared to domestically financed funds, the Bank
Group-assisted funds have been found to have the following advantages:
(a)   they typically provide a stronger framework for management, including
organization, staffing and operation regulations, and consciously seek
links with other environmental protection management measures such as
the promotion of pollution prevention programs;
(b)   they institute rigorous requirements and procedures for project preparation
and appraisal, ensuring a higher project success rate; and
(c)   they train staff of the fund offices in the technical and financial areas.
16.   One disadvantage of Bank-supported funds is that the more rigorous appraisal
procedures have been expensive compared to the size of the typical loan, which has been
under $1 million. Due regard needs to be given to modifications of the appraisal
procedures to bring down costs while maintaining quality.



-139-                      ANNEX12
Xiaoqing River Basin Subloans Facility
17.   The purpose of Xiaoqing River Basin Subloans Facility (XRBSL) is to strengthen
the existing Shandong pollution prevention and control program with a technically and
institutionally sustainable financing mechanism. The subloans would primarily assist
small-scale industrial enterprises within the Xiaoqing River Basin to control pollution
through waste minimization measures, modifications or renovations to existing plants to
reduce waste outputs, clean technology, or recycling waste generated during production.
Industrial upgrading projects designed to reduce the amount of pollutant discharge and to
save natural resources and energy, commercial waste recovery services and wastewater
treatment plants would also be considered by this facility. SEPB has identified a priority
list of Basin enterprises, and others among the 45 most polluting enterprises, to receive
preferential access to XRBSL.
18.   Organization and Financing of XRBSL. XRBSL would be a self-accounting
govermnent facility, with an initial capital equivalent of Y 83 million. The Bank loan
would provide $5 million and Shandong Province would contribute an equivalent sum
over three years (about Y 16.5 million in 1997, Y 12.5 million in 1998 and Y 12.5
million in 1999). While the size of the Bank contribution has been kept small, the
justification for Bank support for the facility derives from, first, the advantages listed
above.
19.   SEPB would prepare draft operations regulations for XRBSL, setting out the
criteria for subloans processing and approvals, the rules and regulations for management,
and defining the terms and conditions for loans. Disbursement against this component
can begin only after selection of a financial agent to act as the agent in handling loan
funds, and the signing of an agreement, acceptable to the Bank, with Shandong Province,
setting out the agency agreement. SEPB, with the cooperation of SFB, would deternine
the institutional structure and staff composition of the Subloans Management Office
(SMO) and approve its annual work plan and budget.
20.   The SMO would have up to 12 staff, to be recruited during a three-year period,
including specialists in environmental science and technology, industrial processing,
economics and finance, and administration. The director would be appointed by SPG,
and other staff would be locally recruited. The main role of SMO would be in investment
project planning, coordination between borrower and financial agent, review of project
feasibility, approval of subloans and supervision of project implementation.  The
financial appraisal would be the responsibility of the financial agent. The technical
appraisal would be contracted to design institutes by the financial agent.
21.   Project Selection.  Each application would be first reviewed by the local
industrial bureau and planning commission to ensure consistency with municipal
environmental planning. If the proposed investment appears feasible, the application
would be forwarded to SMO for further processing. SMO would lead an environmental
appraisal assessing the suitability of the pollution abatement measures proposed to the



-140-                      ANNEX 12
effluents produced in the enterprise. The financial agent would carry out a financial
appraisal, looking particularly at the appropriateness of the investment given the input
and output markets, the quality of enterprise management as demonstrated in their current
operating environment and a financial analysis to ensure the enterprise's ability to repay
the loan. The technical analysis would be carried out in accordance with the criteria
developed in a special training program, and review the designs for easily maintained and
operated systems well within the technical competence of enterprise personnel.
Project Management Procedures
22.   XRBSL operating procedures would include the following:
(a)   SMO would issue directives and solicitations for project proposals to the
priority-area EPBs and planning commissions;
(b)   With consent from the local industrial bureau, the enterprise would submit
a loan application to its EPB and planning commission;
(c)   If the project appears feasible, the local EPB would forward the loan
application to SMO for review and further processing. SMO would carry
out an environmental appraisal while the financial agent would make a
quick financial assessment of the enterprise;
(d)   With SMO concurrence, the enterprise would prepare a feasibility report
including engineering design, cost estimates, a waste minimization plan
prepared by a design institute with expertise in waste minimization, a
financial proposal with a time-bound investment plan, and an
environmental impact assessment;
(e)   Upon receiving the feasibility study, the financial agent would undertake a
detailed financial appraisal, and contract with a design institute to
undertake a technical appraisal;
(f)   After completion of the financial and technical appraisal, the financial
agent would prepare a comprehensive report, including the technical
appraisal carried out by the design institute, which, together with the
feasibility report, it would send to SMO with its observations and
recommendations;
(g)   After the project has been successfully appraised and approved by SMO,
the appraisal report and proposed loan conditions would be submitted by
SMO to the World Bank for no-objection. The Bank would provide
ex-ante review of the first three subloan projects and thereafter for each
subloan of over $300,000, with all other subloans subject to ex-post
review;



-141-                      ANNEX 12
(h)   SEPB, in conjunction with SFB, would be responsible for the final
approval of subloan projects. After approval, SMO would confirm the
loan to the enterprise, any cofinancing agencies and the financial agent;
(i)   SMO would take into account the forecast of the original waste
minimization audit when assessing the project implementation and focus
in particular on the no- and low-cost options implementation;
(j)   After satisfying itself as to the quality of a commissioned project, the
relevant bureau would issue a Certificate of Examination and Acceptance
to the enterprise;
(k)   The bureau in charge would submit examination and acceptance
documents for the project to SMO; and
(1)   SMO would separately assess whether the project meets the design
document requirements.  If it does not, SMO would arrange for
appropriate departments to intervene, seeking necessary amendments to
the project.
Project Appraisal
23.   For the technical appraisal of individual projects, the general criteria to be
considered would be: (a) the project's impact on the ambient environment; (b) a waste
minimization audit and compliance with environmental regulations and standards (EA),
involuntary resettlement (including preparation of a RAP; and (c) technical feasibility and
identification of the least-cost option.  Design institutes responsible for technical
appraisals would have undergone special training in waste minimization. This training
has been established with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP) and the China National Cleaner Production Center.
24.   The financial appraisal must demonstrate that the enterprise, as a whole, would be
financially viable, including meeting a debt service ratio larger than 1.4 after the
proposed project reaches full production capacity. For joint waste treatment facilities, a
financing plan for the operation and maintenance of the facility would be required.
Project Financing Procedures Between Financial Agent and Borrower
25.   Once a subloan application is approved by SEPB/SFB, the financial agent would
execute the loan according to procedures described below:
(a)   The agent would confirm the project financing plan with the borrower, in
accordance with the loan agreement signed between Shandong Province
and the enterprise;
(b)   The enterprise would open an account with the agent;



-142-                      ANNEX 12
(c)   The agent would disburse funds upon receipt of statement of expenditure,
in the form of invoice or letter of credit. Normally, disbursement would
be made once a month;
(d)   The agent would supervise funds use by the enterprise. If project funds
are found to have been used for any purpose other than the approved
project, the agent would refuse further disbursement and notify SMO;
(e)   The agent would report to SMO quarterly on the financial status of loans
made to borrowers. The agent would also report emerging issues and
make suggestions for improvement as needed;
(f)   At project completion, the agent would finalize the financial accounting;
(g)   If projects fail to meet project date or design criteria, the agent shall notify
SMO; and
(h)   The agent would undertake the collection of loan principal, interest, late
payment penalties and fines.
Disbursement would be made through the agent from the account for XRBSL in SFB.
Control and Annual Audit of XRBSL
26.   The quality of waste minimization audit reports would be checked during the first
year of operation by the National Cleaner Production Center (NCPC), located in Beijing.
After this first year, an inspection panel involving NCPC, the World Bank and UNEP
would evaluate the audit quality and procedure.
27.   XRBSL would be audited each financial year by a qualified and independent auditor
acceptable to the Bank. The auditor is required to furnish a written report indicating the
extent to which the financial statements and supporting information provide a true and fair
view of the financial condition and performance of XRBSL. The auditor should also
provide a separate management letter following the completion of the audit on any
improvements required in the financial systems and controls and improved use of resources.
The audit reports and annual accounts should be forwarded to the World Bank within six
months of the end of the fiscal year.
Loans
28.   The aggregate amount of subloans made to any one enterprise shall not exceed the
equivalent of $500,000. The aggregate amount of all subloans from XRBSL made for
any one subproject shall not exceed the lesser of 50 percent of total estimated project cost
(excluding land), or 100 percent of the foreign currency cost. The total estimated cost of
each subproject shall not exceed $1 million. Loan maturity would be three to five years,
with up to two years of grace. SFB would bear the subloan credit risk, and the enterprise



-143 -                    ANNEX 12
the foreign exchange risk. The subloan interest rate would be no less than the standard
interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans plus a spread of 1.5 percent
per year and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent. Repayments to XRBSL would be
recycled for additional subprojects to the extent funds are not needed for repayment of the
Bank loan.
Institutional Development and Equipment Needs
29.   SMO personnel would undergo an extensive training program. Training courses
would include waste management, waste reduction technology, particularly resource
recovery/recycling and clean technology. Training and equipment for XRBSL would be
partly financed under the Management and Agency Strengthening component of the
Shandong Environment Project.

ANNEX 13: MUNICIPAL FINANCES
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIuL PROJECTIONS
1.    The assumptions made when calculating the projections of the on-budget revenue
and expenditure statements of (a) Shandong Province; and (b) Jinan, Weihai and Yantai
Municipalities; for the period 1996-2003 are set out below. On-budget revenues are those
arising from taxes levied on enterprises operating in the these areas; off-budget revenues
consist of special fees to enterprises and are used chiefly for capital expenditures.
Revenue Forecast
2.    The actual (1992-95) on-budget revenue figures have been derived from data
provided by the provincial and municipal governments. Between 1992 and 1995, the
average annual increase in revenue was between 14 and 25 percent in current terms. In
1994, the Central Government restructured the tax system, bolstering its share. As a result,
there were marginal declines in revenue in 1994 from 1993, except for Jinan Municipality,
which posted a gain of 63 percent. To estimate future revenues, average annual increases in
current terms of 10 percent for Jinan, 25 percent for Weihai, and 15 percent for Yantai have
been assumed using 1995 as the base year.
Expenditure Forecast
3.    Historically, on-budget expenditures have registered between 72 and 99 percent of
on-budget revenues. There was little change in that ratio in 1994 when the tax system was
restructured (para. 2), except in Jinan Municipality where expenditures did not rise in
proportion to the gain in 1994 revenues. To estimate future expenditures, the ratio of
expenditures to revenues is assumed to be generally between 72 to 99 percent of revenues.
4.    The following tables summarize projected revenue and expenditure data from 1996
to 2003 for the Municipalities of Jinan, Weihai and Yantai, the main beneficiaries of project
investments, and Shandong Province. Projected project expenditures are also included.

ANNEX 14: FINANCIAL ANALYSIS ASSUMPTIONS
A. JINAN WATER SUPPLY COMPANY
General
1.    The financial projections from 1995 to 2003 for Jinan Water Supply Company
(JWSC) were produced in conjunction with JWSC's financial staff and project
management staff.
2.    Inflation and Exchange Rates: Yearly general domestic inflation rates used in
the projections are: 6.2 percent in 1997, 5.8 percent in 1998, and 5.5 percent thereafter.
Price contingency allowances on the foreign costs of Bank-financed projects are expected
to average 2.3 percent a year from 1997 to 2003. It is assumed that exchange rate
adjustments would, on average, maintain purchasing power parity during the projection
period. The initial exchange rate is Y 8.3/$1.0.
3.    Financial Covenants: Total revenues should cover (a) operating expenses before
depreciation plus debt service coverage plus working capital increases; (b) allow for a
debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.3 times; and (c) contribute a minimum 20 percent
(on a three-year average basis) to capital investment.
Income Statement Assumptions
4.    Water Sales Revenue: Is based on average tariff and average water sales volume
projections. The average tariff growth rate is set so that sales revenue would meet
operating ratio, contribution to capital investment and debt service coverage covenants.
Water sales volume is set as the minimum of projected demand and projected supply
levels. Projected demand is set as the greater of projected usage on a per capita basis or
projected usage on a number of connections basis. Population growth rates and
connection growth rates are based on municipal planning statistics. Capacity expansion
plans are provided by JMWC.
5.    Average Tariffs: The average water prices in yuan per m3 (net of Water Supply
Fund and Public Utility Tax) in current terms during the implementation period for
JWSC are as follows:
1997       1993       1999      2000       2001       2002       2003
0.71      0.80        0.86       0.90      0.99       1.04        1.14
6.    Tariffs: The current residential, commercial and industrial tariffs in Jinan are
Y 0.50/m3, Y 1.30/m3, Y 0.80/m3, respectively. On top of the basic tariff, a Water Supply



-147 -                     ANNEX 14
Fund fee and Public Utility Tax are collected on the water bill on behalf of the
government, which adds approximately Y 0.10-0.20 to each bill.
7.    Sales Taxes: JMWC would be subject to a composite sales tax of 6.6 percent of
gross sales revenue, which includes net value-added tax (VAT) payable to the Central
Government and education and infrastructure taxes payable to Jinan Municipal
Government (JMG).
8.    Personnel: Operation and maintenance personnel are expected to increase to and
remain at a level of 77 staff/1,000 connections. Wages are expected to increase at the rate
of general domestic inflation plus 2 percent.
9.    Electricity: Expenses are projected to grow in real terms, averaging 8.0 percent
per year. It is JWSC's largest operating expense.
10.   Materials:  Expenses grow from the current base at the combined rate of
domestic inflation and capacity expansion.
11.   Maintenance: Expenses increase at the rate of domestic inflation.
12.   Other Expenses: Increase at the rate of general domestic inflation.
13.   Selling Expenses: Are primarily the wages of meter-reading staff. Staff levels
are not expected to increase, but wages are expected to increase at the general rate of
domestic inflation.
14.   Administration: Expenses are comprised largely of pension, medical costs and
management salaries. JWSC plans to keep the level constant in nominal terms.
15.   Depreciation: Composite depreciation rates for JMWC are assumed to be 7.5
percent for assets with a life of less than 15 years and 4.5 percent for assets with a life
greater than 15 years.
16.   Financial Charges: The interest payable on outstanding long-term and short-
term loans.
17.   Nonoperating Income: Comprised of (a) income from JWSC's subsidiaries and
(b) deferred income contributions to nonoperating income (see Other Sources).
18.   Income Taxes: JWSC is expected to pay 33 percent of profit before income tax.
Funds Flow Statement
19.   Long-Term Loan Borrowing: Follows the disbursement profile for this project,
plus disbursements for JMWC's existing loans.
20.   Equity Infusion: JMG capital grants are recognized as deferred income, not
equity.
21.   Other Sources: Government capital contributions to the project. The grants are
recorded as deferred income until asset depreciation begins, at which time deferred



-148 -                      ANNEX 14
income is applied to the income statement as nonoperating income at the same rate as
depreciation.
22.   Fixed Asset Investments:  Based on expenditures for this project and for
JMWC's concurrent network expansion plans. Other investments include (a) other water
supply capacity expansion projects and (ii) replacement investment.
23.   Increases in Working Capital: The excess, or otherwise, of the current year's
current assets (net of cash), less the excess of the previous year's current assets (net of
cash) over current liabilities.
24.   Total Financial Charge: The proceeds of the IBRD loan are assumed to be
onlent by JMG to JMWC at the standard rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency
loans plus 1 percent (6.92 percent per year at the time of appraisal), and 0.75 percent per
year commitment charge, over 15 years, including 5 years of grace. Interest is paid
annually; interest during construction is not capitalized.
25.   Long-Term Loan Repayment: Amortization of loans would be on the basis of
equal payments of principal. JMWC would bear their respective foreign exchange risks.
JMG would provide the local counterpart funds as capital grants so no new loans for the
project are anticipated.
26.   Dividend: No dividend disbursement is planned.
27.   Cash Changes: Calculates the balance sheet cash and short-term marketable
securities balance for the current year. Cash buildups would be applied to future
investment projects.
Balance Sheet
28.   Accounts Receivable: Assumed to be 30 days of billings.
29.   Doubtful Receivable: 0.5 percent of accounts receivable.
30.   Inventory: Projected at 1 year of materials and maintenance expense, due to their
policy of undertaking annual discounted bulk purchases of supplies.
31.   Other Accounts Receivable: Comprised mainly of accounts owing JWSC's
engineering/construction subsidiary. It is expected to remain constant in nominal terms.
32.   Work-in-Process: For the project, assets reflect the implementation schedule.
33.   Accounts Payable:  Assumed to be 60 days of materials and maintenance
expense.
34.   Other Accounts Payable: Comprised largely of Water Supply Fund, connection
fees and construction taxes owing to the government. It is expected to remain constant in
nominal terms.



-149 -                      ANNEX 14
35.   Other Current Liabilities:  Wages payable and advances from  JWSC's
customers.
36.   Long-Term Loans: Comprised of the World Bank loan, a Construction Bank
loan, and a Municipal Water Supply Fund 0 percent loan.
37.   Equity: Remains at existing equity levels.

2.    Inflation and Exchange Rates: Yearly general domestic inflation rates used in
the projections are 6.2 percent in 1997, 5.8 percent in 1998, and 5.5 percent thereafter.
Price contingency allowances on the foreign costs of Bank-financed projects are expected
to average 2.3 percent a year from 1997 to 2003. It is assumed that exchange rate
adjustments would, on average, maintain purchasing power parity during the projection
period. The initial exchange rate is Y 8.3/$1.O.
3.    Financial Covenants: Total revenues should (a) cover operating expenses plus
the greater of depreciation or debt service and (b) debt service coverage should be at least
1.3.
Income Statement Assumptions
4.    Wastewater Sales Revenue: Based on average tariff rates and wastewater sales
volumes. The average tariff growth rate is set so that sales revenue would meet operating
ratio and debt service coverage covenants. In JMDC, projections of wastewater sales
volumes are assumed to be 80 percent of projected water sales volume. In addition, the
Water Conservation Office collects revenues from industry based on annual groundwater
extraction quotas (80 percent of 91.25 million mi3) multiplied by the average wastewater
tariff and passes this revenue on to the drainage company. Average 1997 wastewater
3~~~~~~~~~~3
tariff is Y 0.33/m3.
5.    Average Tariffs. The average prices in yuan per m3 in current terms during the
implementation period for JMDC are as follows:
1997       1998       1999       2000       2001        2002       2003
0.33       0.49       0.50       0.50       0.50        0.50       0.52
6.    Tariffs. The current residential, commercial and industrial tariffs in Y/m3 of
wastewater disposal in Jinan are 0.15, 0.54, and 0.39, respectively.
7.    Personnel: Operation and maintenance personnel are expected to increase to and
then level off at 12 staff/1,000 connections. Wages are expected to increase at the rate of
general domestic inflation plus 2 percent ann'ually.
8.    Electricity: Expenses are projected to grow in real terms, averaging 8.0 percent
per year. This is JMDC's largest expense. Electricity primarily is used to run pumping
stations and aerators, before the wastewater treatment plant becomes operational.



-153 -                      ANNEX 14
9.    Materials:  Expenses grow from the current base at the combined rate of
domestic inflation and capacity expansion rates.
10.   Maintenance: Expenses increase at the rate of domestic inflation.
11.   Depreciation: Composite depreciation rates for JMDC are assumed to be 4.5
percent.
12.   Sales Taxes: JMDC would be subject to no VAT or other sales taxes.
13.   Other Expenses: Increase at the rate of general domestic inflation.
14.   Selling Expenses: JMDC is not expected to have any selling expenses, since
wastewater is directly charged against the water bill and is collected by the water
company on behalf of JMDC.
15.   Administration: Expenses are primarily management salaries.
16.   Financial Charges: The interest payable on outstanding long-term and short-
term loans.
17.   Income Taxes. JMDC is not required to pay income taxes.
Funds Flow Statement
18.   Long-Term Loan Borrowing: Follows the disbursement profile for this project,
plus disbursements for JMDC's existing loans.
19.   Equity Infusion: JMG is expected to contribute its capital grants as deferred
income instead of equity.
20.   Other Sources: The government's capital contribution to the project. The grants
are recorded as deferred income until asset depreciation begins, at which time deferred
income is applied to the income statement as nonoperating income at the same rate as
depreciation.
21.   Fixed Asset Investments: Based on expenditures for this project only.
22.   Increases in Working Capital: The excess, or otherwise, of the current year's
current assets (net of cash), less the excess of the previous year's current assets (net of
cash) over current liabilities.
23.   Total Interest Expenses: The proceeds of the IBRD loan are assumed to be
onlent by JMG to JMDC at the standard rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency
loans plus 1 percent (6.92 percent per year at the time of appraisal), and 0.75 percent per
year commitment charge, over 15 years, including 5 years of grace. Interest is paid
annually; interest during construction is not capitalized.
24.   Long-Term Loan Repayment: Amortization of loans would be on the basis of
equal payments of principal. JMDC would bear the respective foreign exchange risk.



-154 -                      ANNEX 14
Also includes repayment on an existing Austrian Government loan used to construct the
water treatment plant.
25.   Dividend: JMDC plans to distribute no dividends.
26.   Cash Changes: Calculates the balance sheet cash and short-term marketable
securities balance for the current year.
Balance Sheet
27.   Accounts Receivable: Assumed to be 46 days of billings because there is about a
15-day lag between when the water company collects the revenues and when the revenues
are passed to JMDC.
28.   Doubtful Receivable: 2.98 percent of accounts receivable.
29.   Inventory: Projected at four months of materials and maintenance expenses.
30.   Work-in-Process: For the project, assets reflects the implementation schedule.
31.   Accounts Payable:  Assumed to be 60 days of materials and maintenance
expense.
32.   Other Accounts Payable:  Expected to remain constant during project
implementation.
33.   Long-Term Loans: Comprised of World Bank and Austrian Government loans.
34.   Equity:  Equal to the Government's contribution of the existing wastewater
treatment plant.

ANNEX 15: ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
A. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
1.    This project responds to Bank sector work and experience and CAS objectives in
two ways: first through a comprehensive approach to environmental degradation in a
river basin, where it supports the rationale design and prioritization of interventions based
on cost-effectiveness considerations, improvements in the regulatory environment,
measurable reduction of current air and water pollution loads and protection of critical
groundwater resources; second, through establishment of financially sustainable utilities,
backed by a cost-recovering tariff policy. The objectives of the project are consistent
with China's Environmental Action Plan and Agenda 21, which provides the basis for
joint Government and Bank action in the environmental sector, especially in regard to the
urban environment. Finally, the project responds to the specific priorities expressed at
the provincial level, recognizing the effective decentralization of regulatory and
investment authority in China, while building on the local political commitment and
power to induce wider use of the solutions demonstrated under the project.
2.    The proposed project, the specific components of which are described in Annex 2,
would support critical components of a broad provincial program to implement a
comprehensive river basin environmental improvement program for the Xiaoqing River
together with a parallel improvement in urban air quality.
B. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
3.    Shandong's proactive approach to environmental management responds to the
increasing economic costs caused by urban pollution.  These costs have become
increasingly visible as they begin to translate into financial losses of whole sectors, such
as the disappearance of aquaculture in the Xiaoqing River estuary, which represents an
approximate annual loss of Y 200 million. However, most of the environmental damages
have not yet been quantified, such as the damages to human health from air pollution,
losses in agriculture due to polluted irrigation water, depletion of groundwater resources,
and loss of cultural values such as the springs in Jinan.
4.    The large cost of a comprehensive program to reduce pollution in a whole river
basin requires carefal prioritization of interventions to maximize the net benefit from
these investments. Since environmental benefits can only partially be translated into
monetary values, the choice of priority interventions for this project had to be guided by
cost-effectiveness considerations, i.e., the least-cost approach to achieve an environmental
improvement. The project successfully identified several opportunities for cost-effective
interventions by making better use of existing but underutilized urban infrastructure and
by undertaking the critical complementary investments that are required for their efficient



-162 -                     ANNEX 15
operation: e.g., the water supply component in Jinan would allow the existing water
treatment plant to increase capacity utilization from less than 25 percent to about 100
percent. The environmental subloans to industry, in turn, would focus on cost-effective
interventions of pollution prevention and waste minimization, thereby reducing the need
for more costly end-of-pipe investments.
5.   It became clear during project identification that Shandong and its cities needed
substantial change in policy and institutional structures. Policy problems included urban
environmental services priced too low to discourage waste generation or to provide the
financing needed to build, maintain and operate services such as district heating or
wastewater treatment. Therefore, investment choices were made with a view toward
maximizing the impact of policy and institutional innovation within the province by
supporting the establishment of incorporated public utilities, such as the Jinan Drainage
company, or the design of tariff policies that allow financial sustainability of operations.
City and Sector Choices
6.    After reviewing potential investments in several provincial cities, four were
selected for further project development. Jinan, the capital of Shandong Province, which
ranks fourth among the 37 "environmentally most stressed cities in China" according to a
NEPA pollution index, was selected because of its major environmental problems, and its
immediate impact on the water quality of the Xiaoqing River. The other two cities,
Yantai and Weihai, are medium-size cities that had a clearly defined strategy to address
their air pollution problems through the expansion of district heating and offered
opportunities to demonstrate new technologies that would be relevant to other similarly
sized cities in the province. Priority investments in industrial pollution reduction were
identified based on a ranking of the strongest polluting sectors, i.e., paper and pulp,
breweries, and chemical industry, and within these sectors, based on opportunities for
cost-effective and innovative interventions that would provide useful experiences to other
industries in the same sector.
Water Supply in Jinan
7.    Jinan's population of 1.5 million currently consumes about 0.9 million tons/day of
water, which is supplied from three major sources: (a) groundwater (85 percent);
(b) surface water from the Yellow River (10 percent), and (c) reservoirs (5 percent).
Jinan has relied on groundwater to meet its increasing water needs over the last decades.
Today, industry extracts 28 percent and the Water Supply Company the remaining 72
percent of the estimated total 880,000 tons/day of groundwater.
8.    Current Problems. The current volume of groundwater extraction has become
unsustainable. The average level of groundwater above sea level has dropped from
almost 30 m in 1960 to 27.4 m in 1995. The seasonal fluctuations of the groundwater
level have increased from less then 1 m to over 3.9 m during the same period. These
developments indicate an unsustainable level of extraction.  The Water Resource
Conservation Office sets the sustainable volume of extraction at 500,000 tons/day, based
on an estimated daily replenishment of 950,000 tons/day, a spring flow of 250,000



-163 -                     ANNEX 15
tons/day and 200,000 tons/day for agricultural extraction and evaporation. A visible
indicator for groundwater depletion is the reduced flow of Jinan's famous springs.
Reduced spring flow decreased the flow of surface water within Jinan and to the
Xiaoqing River, and, as a result, led to a higher concentration of pollution from industrial
and domestic effluents, specifically during the dry season. This pollution poses a risk to
the quality of the groundwater in Jinan and near the Xiaoqing River.
9.    The Government has introduced regulations to control groundwater extraction,
including quota, individual metering, and charges but has not been able to impose
reductions of groundwater use for lack of viable alternative water sources.
10.   Utilization of surface water from the Yellow River water has been severely
constrained by limited treatment capacity and seasonal fluctuations of the Yellow River
flow. Water extraction started in the 1980s with the construction of a diversion channel
and a 100,000 tons/day pretreatment plant (No. 1), which was later on complemented
with a second much larger 400,000 tons/day water treatment plant. However, limited
capacity of the newer plant to cope with the high level of silt required a pretreatment in
the older facility. As a result, actual water supply from the Yellow River was limited to
100,000 tons/day. Actual water supply was further reduced due to seasonal low flow or
even stoppage of the Yellow River (79 days in 1995, 29 days in 1994) which left the
plant without raw water. As a result, Jinan experiences seasonal shortages of water; the
shortfall is estimated to amount to up to 100,000 tons/day. The shortfall affects primarily
industry and residential areas in the elevated parts of the city, which suffers from low
pressure during these periods.
11.   Business-as-Usual Scenario. Water demand is projected to increase 21 percent
by the year 2000 and over 70 percent by 2005. A review of the water demand projections
confirmed the earlier findings that Jinan faces an increasing shortfall in water supply.
Industrial water demand is projected to increase from about 650,000 m 3/day in 1996 to
950,000 in 2010. These projections are already based on an ambitious assumption of an
annual 6 percent decline of the water consumption per unit of industrial output,
decreasing from 6,000 m3/Y million in 1995 to 2,500 m3/Y million in 2010. Jinan has a
track record of already having achieved, between 1990 and 1995, a reduction from
15,000 m3/Y million to 6,000 (or 20 percent per year). Nonetheless, achieving such
sustained water use efficiency would require special attention to and incentives for water
conservation measures in industries. For private households, increasing water tariffs are
likely to encourage water conservation: a price elasticity of -0.17 for domestic per capita
water consumption was estimated based on JWSC's last 15 years' sales. However, rising
incomes and living standards would more than compensate this impact with an estimated
per capita income elasticity of 0.22. As a result, aggregate demand by households
(including public buildings) at a population growth rate of 2.3 percent (1.9 percent after
2000) would increase from about 300,000 m3/day in 1995 to over 650,000 m3/day in
2010.
12.   If no additional water resources become available, the shortfall of water supply
would rise to 400,000 tons/day (by 2000) and 860,000 tons/day (by 2010), respectively.



-164-                       ANNEX 15
Groundwater would continue to be extracted at unsustainable levels, and seasonal
fluctuations would be accentuated. Water shortages would hamper Jinan's industrial
development, which currently absorbs 70 percent of the water, and quality of life and
health of urban residents would be affected, at a time when expectations toward standards
of living are rising in parallel with higher incomes. If, on the other hand, additional
groundwater would be used to meet the shortfall, its depletion would be accelerated and
the mentioned problems exacerbated.
13.   Long-Term Objective. Hence, Jinan developed a long-term strategy to protect
its groundwater while meeting the rising demand for water by increasing the share of
water supplied from surface water. The target is to increase the surface water share to
about 45 percent in 2000 and to over 60 percent in 2010. The first step to achieve these
targets is to increase actual water extraction from the Yellow River from less than
100,000 to 400,000 tons/day, the design capacity of the second treatment plant. The next
step would be the upgrading of the first treatment plant to supply 100,000 tons/day of
treated water. The third step after the year 2000 would be the implementation of the
Tianshan scheme. The proposed project would support the first phase of this long-term
program through the construction of (a) a settlement basin to desilt the raw water and
(b) a regulating reservoir to compensate for the seasonal fluctuations of the Yellow River
flow.
14.   Economic Analysis. The proposed project generates environmental benefits and
improved urban services that cannot be valued directly.  Several approaches have
therefore been applied to assess the economic soundness and the net benefits of the
project: first, a least-cost analysis of water supply is undertaken, second, a cost-benefit
analysis is conducted using willingness to pay and opportunity costs as revealed by recent
tariffs as a proxy for benefits; and third, intangible and unquantifiable benefits are being
described.
15.   Least-Cost Solution. The following two options were compared to determine the
least-cost solution to meet Jinan's additional 400,000 tons/day water supply by the year
2000: (a) import water from Tianshan over 60 km away to a new water treatment plant in
Dayang in a western suburb of Jinan; and (b) build the Queshan reservoir and settling
pond and connect them to the existing Yellow River Water Treatment Plant No. 2, i.e.,
the project that has been proposed for Bank funding.
16.   Option (b), or the proposed project, is the more cost-effective solution. First, it
makes optimal use of existing but underutilized infrastructure, in particular the Yellow
River Water Treatment Plant.
17.   Second, by comparison, the proposed Tianshan scheme would construct a new
water treatment facility, a new canal of about 60 km and a new extraction gate and would
connect to a multipurpose reservoir that still needs to be built. As a result, for the same
amount of water supply, the total project cost for the water supply component alone
would amount to Y 600 million, not even including the estimated Y 500 to 700 million
for construction of the dam. The project costs would be 58 percent higher than in the



-165 -                     ANNEX 15
proposed Queshan project and the unit cost per ton of treated water per day would be 11
percent higher.
18.   Cost-Benefit Analysis. The economic net benefit of the proposed project was
estimated based on the economic benefits derived from water supply, only, and adjusted
project costs. The environmental and other benefits are being dealt with in subsequent
sections.
19.   Economic Benefits. The project generates benefits in form of incremental water
supplied to consumers. Since water is distributed to different consumer groups, i.e.,
residential, industrial, and commercial, the economic benefits have been estimated
separately for each group. The relative shares of water consumption are expected to
remain constant, with an estimated 33 percent supplied to households and 52 percent
supplied to industry and commerce, and about 15 percent of unaccounted-for water for
other uses including system losses such as leakages.
20.   Ideally, economic benefits for households are determined based on willingness-to-
pay studies. Such studies have been undertaken for other cities (e.g., Kunming) but are
not available for Jinan. Another approach to determine the benefit is the cost of
alternative water supply, or the opportunity cost. However, no alternative suppliers, such
as private vendors could be identified in Jinan, and individual households are not allowed
to extract groundwater. In the case of serious shortages, the municipality trucks in water
and supplies it free of charge. Hence, no parallel market for water has developed.
Therefore, the existing total water charge of Y 0.66/ton was used as an approximation to
the willingness to pay. That charge in 1996 was composed of Y 0.5/ton for the water
tariff proper, Y 0.1 for a municipal water supply fund, and Y 0.06 for utility taxes. The
1995 tariff of is comparable to the findings of the willingness-to-pay studies in Kunming,
which indicated a range of Y 0.60 to 0.72/ton, and to water prices in neighbor cities of
Shandong (about Y 0.70/ton). Therefore, the current total charge has been used to
calculate the economic benefits to households.
21.   The economic benefits to industry have been estimated in two ways: through the
opportunity cost of self-extracted groundwater and the water charge. Currently, 299
industries hold permits to extract up to 250,000 tons/day at an average cost of Y 1.1/ton.
This cost is composed of extraction costs of about Y 0.40/ton, including depreciation and
operation, and a Y 0.70/ton water resource fee to be paid to the municipal Water
Conservation Office. Theoretically, this cost can be considered an opportunity cost that
industry would incur in case no water would be available through the Water Supply
Company. This cost is comparable to the current water charge of Y 1.1 0/ton, including a
surcharge for the municipal water supply fund of Y 0.20/ton and the 10 percent utility
tax, the total price of water for industry adds up to Y 1. 1/ton. Therefore, the total water
charge has been used as a proxy for industry's benefit from water supply. In a similar
fashion, the total water charge of Y 1.65/ton was used to estimate benefits to the
commercial sector.

22.   Economic Costs and Net Economic Benefits. Economic cost estimates were
based on adjusted financial costs provided by the financial analysis of the Jinan Water
Supply Company. The net economic benefit of the proposed project is then Y 150
million, discounted at 12 percent over a lifetime of 20 years and the corresponding ERR
is 18 percent. This result is robust with regard to cost overruns of investments and
operation: assuming a 20 percent higher cost, the corresponding NPV is still positive at
Y 50 million and the ERR is 14 percent. The cost of the existing, but underutilized water
treatment plant was excluded-as a sunk cost-in the baseline scenario. However, to
ensure the economic viability of the combined investment, the estimated residual value of
the existing plant was included in the "Sunk Cost Included" scenario: even then the net
present value (NPV) remains positive at Y 120 million and the ERR is 17 percent.
23.   Unquantifiable and Intangible Benefits.  In addition to the tangible and
quantifiable benefits provided to water users, the project also generates environmental
benefits in terms of groundwater protection and conservation of cultural heritage, which
are more difficult to value.

Lb Sunk-Cost Scenario: including as additional cost the in-use value of the existing treatment plant of

24.   The proposed project would not only satisfy the increasing water demand of Jinan
in the year 2000 but, in addition, allow for a reduction of groundwater extraction by about
10 percent, or 70,000 tons/day. It therefore contributes to Jinan's strategic objective of
reduced reliance on groundwater. By contrast, if the additional volume of water were to
be supplied from groundwater, overall extraction in the year 2000 would reach about 1.2
million tons/day, more than double the recommended sustainable extraction rate of
500,000 tons/day. Overextraction could lead to irreversible damages due to accelerated
infiltration of polluted surface water, given the limestone characteristics of Jinan's
aquifers. In addition, it is doubtful that such overextraction would be feasible because
neighboring communities are likely to refuse Jinan Municipality access to their
groundwater resources in order to meet the growing demand in their own communities.
25.   The project would also have an intangible benefit in form of contributing to the
preservation of the cultural heritage: preserving the famous springs in Jinan. There are
also some tangible but unquantified benefits in terms of avoided loss in tourism.



-167 -                      ANNEX 15
Preservation of cultural values and the long-term environmental benefits add to the
overall net benefit of the project.
Jinan Wastewater
26.   Jinan currently generates daily about 680,000 tons/day wastewater, which is
discharged without treatment either directly or through sewers to the Xiaoqing River. A
wastewater treatment facility was built and completed in 1994 but is presently not
operating because the existing sewer system is deficient and a new intercepting sewer
needs to be constructed to supply the plant with wastewater.
27.   Current Problems. As a result, the water quality in watercourses and lakes
within the city and the Xiaoqing River has deteriorated dramatically. Within the city,
water quality has reached a level that exceeds the lowest National Surface Water Class V
standards. This has turned most of the city's rivers and lakes into open sewers that emit
odors and can cause health problems, which so far have not been quantified for Jinan. In
the Xiaoqing River, a COD level of 220 mg/l has been measured, exceeding the Class V
standards of 25 mg/l over seven times. Since there are no major upstream urban centers,
Jinan is largely responsible for the water quality in the Jinan reach of the Xiaoqing River.
The Government of Jinan is also concerned that the lack of effective sewage treatment
facilities may deter new investors, such as international joint ventures.
28.   Further downstream, Jinan's water pollution has contributed to the deterioration
of water quality, which has already imposed tangible losses on agriculture, aquaculture,
fishery and groundwater quality. Reportedly, about 100,000 mu of aquaculture in the
Xiaoqing River estuary were wiped out during the last six years because of river
pollution, representing an estimated loss of over Y 200 million ($25 million) per year.'
Fishery in the river stopped about 10 years ago due to pollution and dwindling quantities.
Today, the remaining fishing fleet in the estuary has to travel for about 10 hours to areas
at least 40 km off the coast to catch fish, greatly reducing the productivity and income of
fishermen. Groundwater pollution near the Xiaoqing River made it necessary to close
wells within 500 to 1,500 m of the Xiaoqing River and to rebuild them further away from
the river. It appears that Xiaoqing River water is still being used for irrigation, although
at much reduced levels because the quality of the products seemed to be affected.
29.   Business-as-Usual Scenario. If no action is taken and the current situation is
allowed to continue environmental damages and economic costs would increase. In line
with increased water consumption, the wastewater stream in 2000 and 2010 is expected to
have increased by 21 and 73 percent compared to 1995, and so would the pollution load.
Overall, Jinan would not make any progress toward achieving the Class V target water
quality for the city and would in part offset Shandong Province's concerted effort of
cleaning up the Xiaoqing River. In addition to the environmental concerns, the lack of an
1 Estimate based on interviews in Weifang Prefecture using the following assumptions: annual shrimp
production per mu: 100 kg, price per kg: Y 100; annual revenue per mu: Y 10,000. Assuming a value
added of Y 20 ($2.50), the total forgone value added amounts to Y 200,000,000 or $25 million.



-168 -                      ANNEX 15
operating sewerage system would seriously worsen the quality of urban life at a time
when expectations of the population for improved urban services is rising in parallel with
growing incomes and living standards.
30.   Long-Term Objective. Jinan has therefore prepared a long-term wastewater
management plan to reduce pollution from wastewater and to meet the urban sewerage
needs. The plan foresees investments of over Y 1 billion in an extended sewer network
and additional treatment capacity. As a first step, Jinan built the Sewage Treatment Plant
(STP) for about Y 305 million, which is currently idle. The proposed project would
provide the missing connection to the sewerage network and enhance its collection
capacity to allow the STP to operate at its full capacity of 220,000 tons/day, or about 45
percent of the total waste stream. After 2001, a second phase of this STP would be built,
expanding its capacity to 450,000 tons/day. Meanwhile, excess flows would continue to
spill over into the Xiaoqing River.
31.   Economic Analysis. Ideally, a full cost and benefit analysis should be used to
assess the economic net benefit of the proposed investment. However, the quantification
of the economic benefits, which are largely environmental and health improvements,
poses challenging analytical problems, exacerbated by the lack of local data. While there
is no doubt that water pollution results in tangible downstream damage costs, attributing
any specific amount of avoided damage cost to Jinan's wastewater treatment based on
available information would be arbitrary. Under the project, technical assistance to
develop a river model is being financed, which would provide a better understanding of
the economics of the river basin cleanup effort. Therefore, at this point, the economic
analysis focuses on a description of the benefits, the costs to achieve these benefits, and
some of the risks involved.
32.   Economic Benefits. Environmental benefits of undertaking the project include:
(a) a 20 percent reduction of Jinan's COD pollution load discharged into the Xiaoqing
River, which is expected to reduce COD concentration in the river by about 45 percent to
130 mg/l; since this level is still more than five times the target standard for Class V
water (25 mg/i), only marginal short-term benefits for downstream water users, such as
aquaculture or agriculture can be expected. Meaningful benefits would only result from
sustained efforts to reduce pollution from all sources; (b) reduced pollution of the inner
city water bodies, in particular the Daming Lake, which is currently seriously polluted by
direct discharges from industries; and (c) reduced groundwater contamination in Jinan
where groundwater is very close to the surface, supplying the city's famous springs, and
downstream, where many communities had to abandon groundwater wells that were
within 500 to 1,500 m of the Xiaoqing River.
33.  In addition, the project would improve sewerage services to a population of about
1 million and reduce health and safety hazards related to sewage overflows in areas where
currently sewer lines are clogged or connected to the drainage pipes. Such stoppages
would be eliminated through larger sewer capacity and improved design, specifically of
the inverted siphons.



-169-                       ANNEX 15
34.   A long-term benefit of the project is the support for the startup of an independent
and financially viable drainage company. The Jinan Drainage Company was formally
created in September 1996 and would operate as an autonomous entity with financial
responsibility for covering its operational cost and debt service and to contribute an
increasing amount to its capital investments required to keep expanding its services and
to meet the growing future demand. Through its full cost-recovery tariff policy, the
utility would internalize, at least partially, the cost of wastewater pollution abatement
costs and pass it on to water users.
35.   Economic Costs. To achieve these benefits, Jinan would invest Y 264 million in
an improved sewerage network and a connection to the existing STP, which could then
reach its full capacity of 80 million tons/year. Incremental operating costs would be
small because the STP is already fully staffed and operated for maintenance. By contrast,
without the project, Jinan already incurs annual cost of approximately Y 15 million for
depreciation and maintenance of the idle STP without achieving any environmental or
other benefits. This estimate is based on the cost of the 160 staff currently employed in
the plant and an annual depreciation of 4.5 percent of the Y 305 million investment.
36.   An alternative to the project could be the construction of smaller decentralized
treatment plants. However, this option would not be economical given the existing
underutilized treatment capacity in Jinan's central treatment facility. Even without the
existing facility, the high density of population with relatively lower network costs would
favor a central facility.
37.   Operational risks related to industrial effluents need to be managed. About 70
percent of the wastewater flow comes from industry. Industry would benefit from being
allowed to discharge effluents with COD levels of up to 500 mg/l while the effluent
standard for direct discharges is up to 300 mg/l. The corresponding limits for biological
oxygen demand (BOD) are 260 mg/l and for TSP 400 mg/l. There is a risk that industries
would not adequately pretreat their effluents and exceed the allowed limits if the
monitoring and enforcement of such standards is not improved. This is particularly true
for heavy metal and other pollutants which are prohibited from being discharged into
municipal sewerage systems at levels that could disrupt the treatment process.
Effectively controlling such effluents would require the collaboration between the
environmental agencies and the utility. Such arrangements would be further elaborated in
the context of the institutional strengthening of utilities.
District Heating
38.   Use of coal for heating in residential, public and commercial property is a major
source of SO2 and particle pollution of the local air in Shandong Province and has
contributed to the deterioration of air quality, which, particularly during the heating
season, falls well below the prescribed national standards: for example, in the capital
city, the daily average concentration of SO2 during the heating season was 19 times
higher than during the nonheating season and exceeded the SO2 ambient air quality
standard class III. The major sources of heat supply are coal-based (a) stoves with a low



-170-                       ANNEX15
thermal efficiency of only 25 percent, (b) small boilers with an average efficiency of 50
percent, and (c) district heating with larger and more efficient boilers. District heating
currently covers typically about 20 percent of urban heat demand.
39.   Business-as-Usual Scenario. If current heating patterns remained unchanged,
coal consumption for heating would have to increase to meet growing residential and
industrial heat demand. As a result, S02 and TSP levels would rise further. For example,
between 1996 and 2000, coal consumption in Weihai would increase by 67 percent, while
the daily average concentration of S02 would double. Increased levels of air pollution
have a negative impact on human health, causing respiratory problems that can lead to
chronic illness and a loss in labor productivity. Coal burning also causes CO2 emissions,
which have a negative impact on the global environment by contributing to global
warming.
40.   Long-Term Objective. The Government, therefore, for a long time has been
pursuing the introduction of less-polluting systems of local heat supply as a top
environmental priority.
41.   It is in this context, that the Government of Shandong Province selected Yantai
and Weihai as project sites to expand district heating. These choices are well justified:
Yantai is a medium-size city that offers the opportunity to convert an existing power
plant into a CHP, thereby increasing the combined efficiencies of heat and power
generation. Weihai is another medium-size city that offers the opportunity to set up a
new CHP based on an innovative fluidized-bed coal-combustion technology. The plant
would serve the fast-expanding industrial and residential district in the south, thereby
preventing the spread of less-efficient small boilers to serve industrial process heat and
residential heating needs. Both sites explore different district heating solutions and
would therefore provide useful lessons for other cities in the province.
42.   The air quality policies of the provincial and local governments further support
the introduction and expansion of district heating systems. In general, air quality
standards in Shandong Province are stricter than at the national level. Desulfurization
equipment is required for large boilers that bum coal with a sulfur content above 1
percent. Regulations have been passed that forbid the future installation of small boilers
below 10 tons/ hour in city areas. They also require the installation of central heating in
new buildings.  In areas with district heating, the connection to such systems is
compulsory.
43.   Economic Analysis. Ideally, a full cost and benefit analysis, including the value
of avoided air pollution damages, should be used to evaluate each district heating
proposal. However, without reliable local data on the cost of health and other damages
caused by air pollution, such analysis is difficult to undertake. Therefore, the following
three approaches were chosen for the economic analysis: (a) least-cost analysis of the
district heating projects compared to the two major options in terms of heat generation
costs; (b) comparison of their environmental impact, including coal consumption



-171-                       ANNEX 15
emissions of S02, ITSP, and C02; and (c) description of other intangible economic costs
and benefits.
44.   Least-Cost Option. The following three options were selected to determine the
least-cost option for meeting the estimated future demand of residential heat, industrial
steam, and cooling in the project area by the year 2000: (a) business as usual, providing
heat through a combination of small boilers and stoves, as today; all incremental heat
(1996 to 2000) would be supplied by new small boilers since no new stoves are allowed;
(b) small boilers only, replacing all existing stoves with small boilers and continued use
of the existing small boilers; and (c) district heating, replacing all existing stoves and
small boilers, i.e., the proposed project.
45.   Two other options were considered but rejected because they would not be
available in the project areas: (a) the use of natural gas, which would be beneficial from
an environmental perspective, but the natural gas transmission and distribution system for
these cities is not in place, and sufficient natural gas is not available within the time
horizon of the project; and (b) the use of oil-fired boilers, which would facilitate
environmental improvements with small boilers; however, current Government policy
prohibits the use of oil for general heating for balance-of-payment reasons (China is a net
importer of oil). But even if the Government would remove this restriction, coal-based
district heating would be the preferred option, given the high load densities in the project
area that keep network cost low and given the higher cost of nonsulfurized fuel oil that
would be needed to achieve the same environmental standard as with district heating.
46.   Results for Yantai. With the full introduction of district heating in Yantai,
64,000 household stoves and 200 small boilers would have been replaced by the year
2000. A comparison of the economic cost of district heating with "business as usual"
(option 1) and the "small boiler option" (option 2) over a 20-year time horizon indicated
savings under the district heating option of Y 0.2 billion if compared to the first and Y 0.5
billion if compared to the second option. The respective ERR on these net savings are 24
and 66 percent. These net savings are, to a large extent, the result of increases in fuel
efficiency, i.e., lower coal consumption: under the District Heating option, coal
consumption drops by 50 and 30 percent, respectively, compared to Options 1 and 2.
Investment costs are lower, too, even without accounting for the net gain from land
reclamation resulting from the elimination of small boiler houses. However, since land
prices are not firmly established, there is uncertainty regarding the actual market value.
47.   The economic costs of the proposed Yantai system differ sharply from those of
the financial analysis, since the power generating units that would be converted to CHP
production already exist and are treated as "sunk" costs. The only additional expenses
incurred are the connecting costs to the new district heating network and the costs of
forgone power production during the heating season plus the house connection costs from
the heat substations to individual living quarters. However, economic benefits of district
heating are robust; if a city, with a population density similar to Yantai, had no CHP
plant, and a new plant with a distribution network had to be constructed on a "green
field" basis, the economic analysis of this case shows only a small reduction in the ERR



-172-                       ANNEX 15
of less than 2 percent. The small difference can be explained by the slightly more
efficient power generation in large condenser plants compared to CHP plants. For the
two alternatives, stoves plus small boilers (option 1) and small boilers only, a significant
portion of overall costs is accounted for by the replacement costs for worn-out equipment.
A copy of the full economic analysis of the three alternative options can be found in the
project files. Table 2 provides a summary of the results of the above analysis.

48.   Results for Weihai. Introduction of district heating in Weihai's Economic
Development District would lead to the replacement of over 18,000 stoves and about 100
small boilers by the year 2000. Savings under the district heating option amount to
Y 0.35 billion if compared to the first and over Y 0.5 billion if compared to the second
option. The respective ERR on these net savings are 28 and 41 percent. Coal
consumption under the District Heating option drops by 40 and 35 percent compared to
Options 1 and 2. The savings from land that becomes available under the district heating
option have been excluded from the calculation. On the other hand, for the purpose of
comparison it was assumed that stoves would generate a similar heat comfort as district
and central heating, i.e., approximately 18C constant room temperature during the
heating season. However in 1995, Weihai stove owners actually heated much less and
typically had room temperatures of 10 to 12C during four hours a day only, thereby
consuming on average only a third of the coal required for constant 18C room
temperature. Even if compared against the low stove temperature scenario, the district
heating option is still more economical.
49.   In Weihai, the majority of the heat production would be sold as industrial steam
for production, heating and cooling. It could be argued that without district heating
industries would improve the efficiency of their small boilers over time. But even
assuming an increase of average small boiler efficiency from 50 to 65 percent, district
heating would still remain the more economical solution for Weihai's Economic
Development District. Table 3 provides a summary of these results.

Notes: (1)  Scenario "High Stove Temperature": Stove coal consumption was determined based on
similar heat comfort, i.e., 18C room temperature.
(2)  Scenario "Low Stove Temperature": Based on actual 1994 average annual coal
consumption per stove of 0.75 t/a, providing about 10C room temperature during 4 hours.
(3)  Scenario "High-Efficiency Small Boiler": Assumes efficiency improvement from 50
percent to 65 percent and low stove temperature.
(4)  Scenario "Full Cost" includes economic costs for air pollution (based on estimated health
costs) (see also Table 6).
50.    Environmental Benefits.  In addition to saving costs in heat generation, the
district heating option also generates environmental benefits. Introducing district heating
would reduce S02, TSP, and CO2 emissions as a result of two factors: (a) higher fuel
efficiency, i.e., lower coal consumption and (b) more effective and better-managed air
pollution control devices. Reduced emissions, together with the effect of higher stacks,
would then lead to improved ambient air quality in both Yantai and Weihai.
51.    In Yantai, district heating would lead to a 97 percent reduction of S02 and 96
percent reduction of TSP emissions if compared to the "business-as-usual" option, i.e.,
stoves and boilers. Compared to the small boiler option, the reductions are 96 percent for
SO2 and 90 percent for TSP. These results are summarized in Table 4.
52.    In Weihai, district heating would lead to a 80 percent reduction of SO2 and 90
percent reduction of TSP emissions if compared to the "business-as-usual" option, i.e.,
stoves and boilers. Compared to the small boiler option, the reductions are 80 percent for
SO2 and 85 percent for TSP. These results are summarized in Table 5.

Ld Stove coal consumption was determined based on similar heat comfort, i.e., 18C room temperature. In
1994, actual annual coal consumption per stove was 0.75 ton/year compared to 2.2 tons/year to achieve
180C comfort.
53.    In order to assess the full cost of each option, the economic cost of air pollution
should be included. However, the methodologies to calculate the economic cost of air
pollution are still being debated and reliable data on health impact and exposure are not



-175 -                        ANNEX 15
available in Shandong. Some information on health costs related to air pollution is
available internationally, but this information needs to be adjusted to local circumstances.
In order to illustrate the impact of benefits from reduced air pollution damage on the
overall economic benefits, a simplified approach (so-called benefit-transfer approach) has
been applied, using data from Europe (the United Kingdom) adjusted by the ratio of GNP
in China and the United Kingdom. Based on this approach, the following benefits per ton
removed were applied: Y 440 for SO2, Y 3,800 for TSP, and Y 1.6 for CO2. As a result,
project costs increased by 15 percent to 50 percent for the various options. Considering
pollution cost makes district heating economically even more attractive: The district
heating option generates additional savings of Y 130 million in the form of reduced
emissions (or Y 90 million if compared to option 2). TSP reductions represent the largest
share (over 80 percent) of these savings, followed by SO2 (about 15 percent) and CO2
(less than 5 percent). Including the cost of pollution does not change the ranking of
options in this case, but points to additional benefits of the project for the local
enviromnent (SO2, TSP) and the global environment (CO2 reduction) (see Table 6).

Note: Economic Cost of air pollution based on following marginal abatement costs ($/ton): S02=200,
TSP=50 and C02= 10.
54.   Other Costs and Benefits. The height of stacks of the two district heating plants
is over 100 m, allowing for a better dispersion of emissions. By comparison, the stack
height of existing small boilers is typically 20 to 35 m. Occasionally, the stack height is
lower than the surrounding buildings, exposing nearby dwellers directly to air pollution.
District heating would also significantly reduce exposure to indoor pollution: stoves
exhaust fumes through windows or building chimneys and require handling of coal
within the building, causing air pollution within the building where exposure to its
residents is greatest.
55.   As part of the district heating projects, tariff adjustments are being made to ensure
a.full cost recovery of the heating operation. These costs include the investment and the



-176 -                     ANNEX 15
operation of effective pollution control equipment. Therefore, these district heating
projects effectively internalize the cost of pollution abatement, which in turn provides an
incentive to use heat in an efficient manner.
56.   While, in the aggregate, consumer would face the full cost of heating, including
environmental pollution control, this price signal is currently not being passed on directly
to the individual end-user since residential central heating bills are typically based on
floor area, but not on actual heat consumption. There is therefore a risk that when
moving from individual stoves (where the cost is directly linked to consumption) to
central heating, people would consume heat in a more wasteful manner. The project
therefore promotes the introduction of individual metering for each household unit. A
demonstration project would be implemented in Yantai that would test individual
metering and billing procedures. Also, assurance would be sought from the municipal
governments, that new buildings and newly installed central heating systems are
equipped with two-pipe heating systems that allow for individual household metering and
room temperature control.
57.  In summary, the proposed District Heating solutions present a win-win economic
opportunity: the package of fuel efficiency, least-cost operations, and net environmental
benefits makes the proposed project attractive from an economic, environmental, public
finance, and utility perspective.
Credit Line for Pollution Abatement (XRB Subloan Facility)
58.   The pollution abatement line of credit, described in detail in Annex 12, would
serve as a transitional financial mechanism to support enterprises that discharge into the
Xiaoqing River to reduce their pollution in a cost-effective way. The amount of
commercial or quota lending for environmental measures is very limited, because most
banks are still regulated by the planning commissions in forming their portfolio. The
pollution abatement line of credit, to be established under this project, would focus on
investments that demonstrate win-win opportunities where investments lead to efficiency
gains, which partly or fully offset the costs in abatement. Since the fund would deal with
heavy polluters, the marginal cleanup costs would be quite low for the initial pollution
abatement and the impact is estimated to be significant at an enterprise level. Since the
fund is currently limited to $10 million, the direct impact on the water quality of the
Xiaoqing River, however, would only be marginal. The subloan facility would be
supported by (a) the XRB water quality study; (b) the Basin time-bound Environmental
Action Plan; and (c) time-bound Action Plans for the three top-ranked polluters. These
commitments by SP to actually address pollution reduction would be expected to yield
high but not easily quantifiable returns.
C. AFFORDABILITY
59.   As part of the Government's policy to establish financially viable utilities, tariffs
for urban environmental services would be raised to a level where operational costs are
covered and a contribution made to future investments. Since these utilities provide



-177-                          ANNEX 15
essential services, the impact of these tariff increases on the poor was assessed, using for
reference the 1995 income of persons in "very poor households" as defined in Shandong
Province's 1995 Statistical Yearbook. For water and wastewater, the combined annual
cost does not exceed 3 percent at the suggested 1997 and 2000 tariff level. For district
heating, on the other hand, the share is 8.5 percent and drops to 6.5 percent in 2000.
While this is a considerable burden to poor households, the cost is comparable to current
expenditures for heating a coal stove. Even at drastically lower heating standards, annual
coal consumption is about 1.0 ton at an average cost of Y 488 per stove. If divided
among two income earners, the annual cost is Y 240 per person, compared to Y 230 per
person for district heating. Table 7 shows that the proposed project investments are
generally affordable.

D. PROJECT RISKS
60.   The Bank-supported components of the Shandong Environment Project form part
of a broader strategy to secure environmental improvements in the Xiaoqing River Basin
and enhanced well-being in Jinan and other project cities. Each component, if effectively
implemented, would make a local contribution to the regional objective of the River
Basin. However, to have a basinwide impact, the institutional innovations, the new
approaches to pollution management, and demonstrated technologies of each of the
components need to be replicated and complemented by sustained efforts across sectors
and throughout the Basin.
61.   Risks surrounding the project have therefore been divided into two broad
categories: Short/Medium-Term Project Risks and Long-Term Strategic Risks. The
former center around the immediate requirements of the project and the successful



-178 -                     ANNEX 15
implementation of its components. The latter center around the overall impact of the
project and relate to the sustainability of environmental improvements in the Xiaoqing
River Basin.
Short/Medium-Term Project Risks
62.   The principal risks directly associated with the implementation of the project and
the achievement of immediate project outputs can be grouped in environmental/
technical, financial and institutional issues (as summarized in Table 8 below).
Long-Term Strategic Risks
63.  Increased Environmental Pressures. Rapid economic and population growth in
the Xiaoqing River Basin area may simply exert too much pressure on available water
and land resources, and the emergent planning and environmental controls may not be
able to cope with this. Furthermore, the degree of ecological integrity and carrying
capacity of the environment are key parameters which would determine the level and
intensity of urban and rural development in the river basin, but many of these are
unknown at present. These long-term risks are summarized in Table 9 below. Increased
environmental pressures are caused by the following:
(a)   Inappropriate Resource Pricing. The underlying causes of a number of
environmental problems in the Xiaoqing River Basin area are in part a
product of underpricing resources and urban services, such as water and
heating. The transition toward sustainable resource use has begun with the
removal of subsidies on fuels, such as coal, and the introduction of tariffs
which ensure the financial viability of their providers. The next step
would require changes in resource pricing, which also reflect the
environmental effects of resource use, such as groundwater extraction and
water pollution.
(b)   Development Pressures from Industrialization. Other areas of potential
conflict include the push for industrial growth and need to protect the
environment. Given the high returns on investments in a fast-growing
economy, pollution reduction is competing for scarce capital with high
opportunity costs.  Only a systematic internalization environmental
externalities, as has started at a low level with the introduction of pollution
charges, would resolve this apparent conflict by transforming
environmental related expenditures into costs of doing business.
(c)   Development Pressures from  Urbanization.   Population growth
(including the floating population in the urban and peri-urban areas) would
lead to intensified competition for land and water while at the same time
increase pollution loads. A key risk here is that the pace of urban
development exceeds the financial and institutional capacity of Jinan
Municipal Government and other municipalities to expand urban
environmental service and pollution control measure fast enough.

64.   The investment components would, within their scope, mitigate some of these
risks by improving resources pricing and the provision of environmental services. The
technical assistance under the project would then play a key role in disseminating these
experiences and assist the Province to integrate them in the broader context of the river
basin. For example, the Long-Term Study for Xiaoqing River would provide planning
tools and data to anticipate and manage environmental risks.
Institutional Risks: Failure to Manage Environmental Pressures
65.      Increasing  environmental pressures necessitate  that institutions  must have  the
capacity to manage these pressures. Environmental management in the river basin is
marked by weak and fragmented institutions, lack of clear lines of authority and conflict
and lack of cooperation among institutions at all levels. To date, there has been a
reluctance to enforce regulations and make polluters pay. There would be an overriding
need for cooperation and coordination among institutions specifically responsible for
environmental protection and development control around the Xiaoqing River Basin. A
critical component of the success of the project is the enforcement by Shandong
Provincial Government (SPG), JMG, JEPB and other relevant EPBs of the existing and
enhanced environmental protection measures and regulations.
