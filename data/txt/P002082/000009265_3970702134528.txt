MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF TIHE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$173.2 MILLION
TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR LAGOS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed Bank loan to the Federal
Government of Nigeria for the equivalent of US$173.2 million is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan, which would be on standard Bank terms,
w-ould assist in financing the Lagos Water Supply Project.
2.        Background and Strategy.  Metropolitan Lagos, with an estimated
population of over 6 million, accounts for about 90% of the State's
population. Drinking water supplies in Lagos State are drawn from both
surface and underground sources. Existing water production and treatment
facilities in Metropolitan Lagos have a combined design capacity of 306,000
m3/day with an average daily production (19B7) of 262,500 m3/day. The
existing system has about 106 km of transmission mains and 1200 km of
distribution mains. Present capacities of both, waterworks and
distribution network, are exceedingly small compared to demand resulting in
an access by only about 47% of the population or 2.9 million inhabitants.
Consumption stands at less than 35 lcd as opposed to the minimum, basic
requirements for drinking, cooking, washing and sanitation of about 75 lcd.
Based on a projected growth rate of 4.5% over the next 20 years, Lagos
Metropolis population will be about 15.7 million by 2005 with a projected
demand of some 1.2 million m3/day. LASG has recognized that increased
access as well as level of services is, therefcre, high on its list of
priorities. Also one of LASG's principal aime is to restructure public
sector enterprises with a view to gradually reduce, and eventually
eliminate, recurrent expenditures subvention which weigh heavily on the
State's finances.
3.        Project Objectives.  The aim of the project is to:
(a) increase population access to drinking water supplies by doubling
production and distribution network capacities;
(b) gradually eliminate recurrent subvention support from LASC to
LSWC and thus improve public expenditure policies;
(c)  strengthen the executing agency LSWC, including training
facilities and programs, manpower management and accountability;
Cd) improve the efficiency of LSWC's operations and maintenance
services; and
Ce) improve the economic efficiency, financial performance and future
viability of LSWC.

4.        Project Description.  The main thrust of the project will be:
(a) expansion of water supply facilities through construction of an
intake structure on the Ogun River, raw water pumping station and
8.2 km of 1,600 mm main to a 320,000 m3/day treatment plant to be              .
constructed at Adiyan for flocculation, clarification, aeration,
rapid sand filtration, disinfection, treated water pumping,
transmission and storage at Oke-Aro reservoir (10,000 m3);
(b) expansion of the transmission and distribution system by:
(i) laying of 65.5 km of existing steel pipes and fittings
varying in diameter from 2,000 mm to 800 mm from the treatment
plant to Metropolitan Lagos and supply and laying of an
additional 14 km of the same range of sizes to the northern part
of the city; (ii) supply and laving of about 280 km of secondary
pipeline ranging in size from 800 mm to 300 mm and 877 km of
tertiary pipes of diameter smaller than 300 mm together with
valves and fittings; and (iii) provision and installation of
materials for approximately 110,000 new service connections
together with 75,000 meters and 420 additional public standposts;
(c)  rehabilitation of existing systems including the anti salinity
weir on the Iju river to minimize salt water intrusion, the
Ishasi waterworks, several mini waterworks and about 94 km of
pipelines including replacement of defective valves and hydrants,
and other spare parts;
Cd) improvement of the administrative infrastructure through
expansion and/or rehabilitation of offices, workshops, depot and
stores facilities, provision of vehicles and mobile plant and
workshop, distribution system, communications and training
equipment and tools, and supply and installation of data
processing equipment; and
(e) institutional support by providing (i) 940 man-months of
consultants services for hydraulic analysis, detailed design and
construction supervision; (ii) 282 man-months of technical
support services to LSWC in the area of project management,
accounting and data processing, billing and collection and
maintenance; (iii) development of training programs, training
consultancy (60 man-months), and overseas secondment of LSWC key
staff for on-the-job training in key areas of activity;
Civ) 12 months support for semi-annual implementation, planning
and review workshops; (v) studies of groundwater potential and
usage and development of appropriate sanitation technologies to
cope with increased public water supplies; and (vi) an 0 & M
study of LSWC.

5.        Total project cost is estimated at US$461.8 million equivalent
with a foreign exchange component of US$413.1 million, or 89%. Total
external financing amounts to US$389.2 million with the balance of
US$72.6 million being contributed by LASG.  Substantial co-financing by
French Commercial Banks, US$164.8 million equivalent, EIB US$47.4 million
equivalent, CIDA US$3.2 million equivalent and UNDP US$0.6 million
equivalent has been secured.  A breakdown of costs, the financing plan and
the estimated disbursement of the Bank loan are given in Schedule A.
Amounts and Methods of procurement and disbursement categories are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Nigeria are at Schedules C and D, respectively.
Maps IBRD 20026 and 19683 show the general location and the existing and
proposed areas to be served.  The Staff Appraisal Report No. 6375-UMI,
dated April 25, 1988, is being distributed separately.
6.        Rationale for Bank Group Involvement.  The Bank Group's water
sector strategy for Nigeria is set out in the Water Supply and Sanitation
Sector Memorandum (Report No. 4696-UNI dated October 30, 1984). At the
Federal level the Bank is working with the Government to establish common
accounting, cost recovery and national training policies through a water
sector rehabilitation project which is currently being prepared - access to
funds for rehabilitation would only be approved for those states willing to
undertake such sectoral policy reforms. The Bank is assisting directly
three States with water supply investments which had been requested through
the Federal Government; Lagos will be the fourth state. There are no
completed projects in the sector yet. The main problems to date have
concerned cost recovery and delays in tariff increases. With the Bank's
intervention there have been some improvements in billing and collection
systems and increased awareness by State Governments that by improving the
financial performance of State Water Utilities that Government recurrent
subventions can be reduced. The Bank was invited in 1984 by the Lagos
State Government to help it define sector investment priorities and to
participate in financing the priority program. The Bank's involvement in
the proposed project will enable achievement of the project objectives
(para 3) and benefits (para 9) and, equally important, the mobilization of
finance that may not otherwise have become available. The mobilization and
coordination of the support of the financing community represents an
important contribution by the Bank to the medium-term development of public
water supplies in Metropolitan Lagos.
7.        Actions Agreed.  The following agreements have been reached
during negotiations or completed since then:



- 4 -
(a) Lagos State Government - (i) will agree, annually as required,
with LSWC the level of tariffs, recurrent subvention, and debt
service support so as to enable LSWC to meet annually progressive
financial targets (see 7 (b) (iv)) which will lead to a positive,
financial rate of return on its revalued assets by 1996;                       E
(ii) will provide counterpart funds, as equity, quarterly in
advance to enable LSWC to meet all payments under the project;
and (iii) has adopted a phased scheme of delegation of
responsibility to LSWC for contract awards and payments to assist
LSWC implement its wider responsibilities for sector development
as defined in the new LSWC Act 1986; and,
(b) Lagos State Water Corpor1a tion - will: (i) provide 2% per annum of
its personnel budget for training of LSWC staff; (ii) appoint
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, for auditing LSWC's
FY87 and subsequent years' annual accounts; (iii) implement the
commercial development plan dated November 1987, including
consumer enumeration; (iv) meet 100% of its cash operating
expenses by FY91 and meet by FY95 total cash operating expenses
and depreciation, or debt service, whichever is the higher, in
accordance with agreed annual targets for FYB9-95; (v) prior to
borrowing, ensure that its net revenues cover debt service
requirements 1.5 times; (vi) identify and mobilize an adequate
number of counterpart staff to work with consultants and
contractors as part of a knowledge transfer program; and
'vii) monitor and report periodically on project execution.
B.        The conditions of loan effectiveness are:  execution of
subsidiary loan agreements between FGN and LASG and between LASG and LSWC,
and the fulfillment of all conditions precedent to effectiveness of the EIE
Loan Agreement and the French Commercial Bank Loan Agreements.
9.        Justification and Risks.  The proposed project, whish is the
first of three simi'lar sized phases, each providing 320,000 m /day of
production capacity, represents the least cost solution. Several
alternatives were considered to explore whether different phasing or a
smaller project would be a better option - the analysis showed that the
proposed scope is the optimal size. Smaller plant sizes resulted in higher
average incremental costs of production and lower rates of return due to
relatively high, fixed investment costs, lower production and consumption
levels and delays necessitated by plant redesign. The economic rate of
return of the proposed project is 13Z. The sensitivity analysis produced
results ranging from 10 to 17%. The lower figure (10%) assumes a 10%
reduction in benefits and a 10% increase in project costs; the higher
figure (17Z) assumes construction schedule as planned, 100% capacity output
and cost savings of 10%. The project will improve the water supply to many
of the 2.9 million (19B5) people presently served and increase the level of
access to 6.5 million people in 1995, or, from 47% to 65% of the
population. Without the project the level of access would decline to 30%
of the projected 1995 population of Metropolitan Lagos.



-5-
10.       One of the main risks to the project is if LASG does not permit
LSWC to increase its tariffs by up to 50% in constant prices by 1994 - the
recent action of increasing LSWC's tariffs by an average of 270% has
demonstrated a willingness to pursue the project's financial and economic
objectives. Even though LASG has also moved a long way in increasing the
level of delegation of responsiDility to LSWC, there is a potential risk
that LASG will interfere in the administrative autonomy of LSWC and thereby
prevent efficient implementation of the project and sound management of
LSWC. The recent appointment of a Permanent Secretary to oversee World
Bank assisted projects in the State may mitigate concerns for this aspect.
Additionally, LSWC will receive technical support from a more developed
water utility to underpin its development and transformation. Counterpart
funding has typically been erratic in Nigeria until recently; the funding
requirement from LASG is large, but affordable, as LASG is uniquely placed
for internal cash generation (which depends for only a small part on oil
revenues of the Federation).
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
