LAGOS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:               Federal Government of Nigeria (POW)
Beneficiary:            Lagos State Government (LASG)/Lagos State
Water Corporatimn (LSWC)
Loan Amount:            US$173.2 million
Terms:                  Payable over 20 years, including five years of grace.
at the standard variable interest rate.
Onlending Terms:        FGN will onlend the full amount of the loan to LAW
which in turn will relend it to LSWC on the sam terms
as the Bank loan. LSWC will bear the foreigp exchage
risk.
Co-Financing:           French Commercial Banks               (US$164.8 a)
European Investment Bank (EIB)        (US$ 47.4 a)
Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA)                       (US$  3.2 a)
United Nations Development Program
(UNDP)                             (US$ 0.6 a)
Project Description:    Increased production capacity of 320,000 a  per day
(70 mgd); laying of additional 80 km of primary mains;
providing and laying 280 km of secondary afns, 877 km
of tertiary distribution mains and about 112,000
constuner connections; rehabilitation of existing water
supply facilities; provision of additional vehicles,
mobile plant, equipment and tools; provision of
office, workshop and depot accommodation and provisio
of consultant and technical support personnel to
assist with institutional development of LSWC
including training and studies.
Project Benefits        The project will improve the water supply
and RiEks:            to many of the 2.9 million (1985) people presently
served and increase the level of access to 6.5 millom
people in 1995 or from 47X to 651 of the population.
Without the project the level of access would 4eclite
to 30X of the projected 1995 population of
Metropolitan Lagos. The sector institution, LWC,
which is also the executing agency, will be
strengthened and its operations and maintenanc



- vii -
improved. One of the main risks to the project is if
LASG does not permit LSWC to increase its tariffs by
up to 502 in constant prices by 1994 - the recent
action of increasing LSWC's tariffs by an average of
270% has demonstrated a willingness co pursue the
project's financial and economic objectives. Even
though LASG has also moved a long way in in..reasing
the level of delegation of responsibility to LSWC,
there is a potential risk that LASG will interfere in
the administrative autonomy of LSWC and thereby
prevent efficient implementation of tne project and
sound management of LSWC. The recent appointment of a
Permanent Secretary to oversee World Bank assisted
projects in the State may mitigate concerns for this
aspect. Additionally, LSWC will receive technical
support from a more developed water utility to
underpin its development and transformation.
Counterpart funding has typically been erratic in
Nigeria until recently; the funding requirement from
LASG is large, but affordable, as LASG is uniquely
placed for internal cash generation (which depends for
only a small part of oil revenues of the Federation).

NIGERIA
LAGOS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION SECTOK
THE SECTOR
A. An Overview
1.01      The country and sector background, together with existing water
supply system physical characteristics are set out in Annex 1-1. Under
Nigeria's federal system of government, the FGN controls the 11. River Basin
Development Authorities which are primarily responsible for water resources
(sea Map IBRD 20026). The individual states have the primary
responsibility for the public water supply and waste disposal sector.
1.02      Lagos is the smallest, but most densely populated State in
Nigeria, itaelf the most populous country in Africa. Metropolitan Lagos,
with a population estimated at over 6 million, accounts for approximately
90% of the State's population. This was as a result of both immigration
and a high natural growth rate (about 9% per annum in the 1950 to 1980
period).   The population is expected to continue to grow at an estimated
4.5% per annum to reach 12.1 million by the year 2000.  Population data are
included in Annex 1-2. The Lagos State Water Corporation (LSWC) which was
established in 1980 has statewide responsibility for public water supplies.
It reports to the Lagos State Government (LA3G) through the Department of
the Environment in the Office of the Governor of Lagos State.
B,  Water Resources in Lagos State
1.03      Drinking water supplies in Lagos State are drawn from both
surface and underground sources. There are two principal surface sources;
the Ogun River, which serves the needs of the majority of the population,
and the Owo River. Presently about 204,570 m3 per day (45 mgd) of raw
water are drawn from the Ogun and the Iju, at Itj waterworks, and about
18,180 m9 per day (4 mgd) from the Owo at Ishasi waterworks. The Oyan River
Dam completed in 1983, and operated by the Ogun-Oshun River Basin
Development Authority (OORBDA), already ensures reliable yields of an
additional 960,000 m3/day (210 mgd) for LSWC into the next century.
Because of its importance to both the project and future investment
strategy, issuance of a license from OORBDA authorizing LSWC additional
abstraction up to 640,000 m3/d (140 mgd) was requested and has been
obtained in April 1988. Further impoundment under construction in the
upper catchment area will increase considerably the safe yield of the Ogun
River making it possible to continue its use to supply most of the
aticipated future water supply needs of the metropolis. The potential ft
-roundwater is limited - maximum reliable yield in the Lagos area was



- 2 -
assessed In 1977 at 477,330 m9 per day (105 mgd) of which industry is
estimated to be abstracting about 363,680 m9 per day (80 mgd) and the rest
for domestic consumption through the mint waterworks (para 1.04). More
up-to-date information would be gathered during a study included in the
project execution to enable LSWC to control groundwater use.
C. Water Supply Facilities and Levels of Service
1.04      As a result of operational difficulties, both Iju and Ishasi
waterworks (para 1.03) produce less than their rated capacities. There
ire, in addition to surface water facilities, ten mini waterworks systems
which draw on groundwater to augment supplies on a localized basis. The
combined capacity of these ten systems is 120,000 m9 per day (26.4 mgd) of
which 7 producing 81,830 ms per day (18 mgd) are within Metropolitan Lagos.
Some production improvements are possible at these mini waterworks and
would be carried out as part of the project. The LSWC's water supply
facilities are described more fully in Annex 1-1 and shown on Map IBRD
19682R.
1.05      While the average level of service for all purposes was targeted
in 1978 at 114 lcd (25 gcd) by 1985, the actual level is far below this at
an average of 35 lcd (8 ged). However, this average includes wiJe
disparities in the state from near full access in parts of Lagos Island,
Ikoyi and Victoria Island to negligible access in parts of Agege, Ajogunle,
Idimu, Ikotun, Ogudu and Maroko. There are no reliable data on leakage or
unaccounted-for water, which heightens the uncertainty of the present level
of aervice. Service to consumers is made either through house connection
or public standposts. It is estimated that there are about 80,000 direct
consumer connections (metered and unmetered) and 2,800 standposts. Under
the project the population having access to public water supplies will
increase from 2.9 million (1985) or 47% to 6.5 million in 1995 or 65%.
WitSout the project, the proportion would fall to about 30% by 1995.
Direct domestic connections would increase by 110,000 to about 189,OG3 (43%
access) and public standposts to about ,,200 (22% access) (Annex 1-2).
Industrial and commercial connections would increase from about 8,000 to
12,000 under the proposed project by 1995 and about 65,000 meters would be
installed as part of the project; an additional 10,000 meters would be
procured for stock.
D. Sanitation Facilities and Levels of Service
1.06      The only part of Lagos which has a conventional sewerage system
together with aerated lagoon treatment facilities is Victoria Island.
Additionally, a number of Government housing estates and institutions have
water-borne sewerage draining to individual package treatment plants. In
total, some 5% of the population is served by these various systems and
Government plans to spend N160 million in the next few years on improving
the operation of the existing plants and increasing the number of estates
served (Map TBRD 20020). Elsewhere,wastewater collection and treatment is



-3-
less than satisfactory - 50% of the Lagos population use the nightsoil or
pail system for the disposal of human wastes, while 35% use pit latrines
and 10% rely on septic tanks. Under a 1977 state government initiative to
switch from the pail system, about 6,000 septic tanks were installed. The
program was subsequently changed to a tenement tax relief system to
encourage landlords to install septic tanks, but this did not bring about
the desired changes. Since May 1986 the State Government has put into
force legislation for the elimination of the pail system. The State
Ministry of Works and Transport is recruiting a team of 34 technical
personnel to facilitate the implementation of the legislation.
1.07      As facilities for exereta and sullage disposal are inadequate,
the drainage system acts as a surrogate sewerage system. The low lying
tidal topography of Lagos together with high rainfall intensities requires
that due attention is given to the adequacy of drainage and drainage
networks. While there have been some improvements to the primary drainage
system in recent years (Map IBRD 20020) the investment has been inadequate.
The ongoing Bank financed Lagos Solid Waste and Storm Drainage Project
(Loan 2620-UNI) will improve solid waste collection and disposal, complete
major drainage systems and expand drain cleaning and rehabilitation
activities thus improving the removal of wastewater and eliminating the
worst of the flooding problems, which occur in about one third of Lagos
Metropolitan Area. Increased public water supplies to be made available
under the proposed project would, however, be insignificant relattve to
rainfall runoff and thus pose no flooding and related problems. In the dry
season, however, when the regular flushing action of stormwater is absent,
tertiary drainage channels are more likely to be blocked by deposition of
solids, refuse and other debris resulting in ponding of contaminated water
where sullage is discharged into such systems. This could be exacerbated
as a result of the proposed project, but due attention will be given to
possible wastewater problems through studies to be carried out under the
project. The project is not at risk by deferring investment in solutions;
if any are needed,they would be included in the second phase of the water
supply expansion program.
LSWC - THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY
E. Organization and Management
1.08      In 1980, LASG created the Lagos State Water Management Board with
statewide responsibility for supplying water and operating sewerage systems
(Lagos State Law No.21). In 1983, sewerage responsibilities were returned
to a department (now Department of the Environment) within the parent
ministry, Lagos State Ministry of Works and Transport (LMWT). As a result
of the increasing importance attached to water supply matters within the
State and in anticipation of undertaking the proposed project, the Governor
promoted the Water Management Board to a Class 1 Corporation in 1985 and
re-designated it as the Lagos State Water Corporation (LSWC) - grade levels
of key positions were also raised. LSWC management is headed by a General



- 4 -
Manager, supported by four Engineering Controllers (Projects, Engineering,
Operations, Electrical/Mechanical), a Quality Controller (Chemist),
Controller of Finance and a Secretatry as shown in the existing Organization
Chart in Annex 1-3 Attachment. The Corporation's powers, duties and
responsibilities are codified in the Lagos State Water Corporation Act of
1986. The spirit of the new law is gradually being adopted by LASG in its
dealings with LSWC.
1.09      In February 1987, the Government dissolved the Board of Directors
of 10 members and LSWC is now attached to the office of the State's
Military Governor pending appointment of a new Board expected in April
1988. Steps were also taken to transfer staff and continue to be taken to
transfer functions to LSWC as part of building up its autonomy for
decision-making on sectoral matters. LASG is implementing a program for
gradually increasing the autonomy of LSWC, including contract award and
expenditure authorization limits.
1.10      The build-up ef the institution will be substantially accelerated
during the early stages of project implementation and this is an integral
part of the proposed project's Administrative Infrastructure and
Institutional Support components (para 2.02 (d) and (e)). To support its
effort to transform LSWC into the viable water utility necessary for
successful implementation of the project, the Corporation has requested
354 man months of technical assistance which will be financed by the
project for selected key areas, principally training, project management,
accounting, billing and collection and data processing. The need is
supported by the findings of a comprehensive organization and management
study carried out by the French water utility Lyonnaise des Eaux (LDE).
The study, financed by UNDP with the Bank as Executing Agency, was
commissioned by LASG and LSWC to ensure successful implementation of the
proposed substantial investment in and expansior of public water supply
facilities.  The study's findings, available in draft form during
appraisal, were thoroughly reviewed and discussed between LASG, LSWC, LDE
and the appraisal mission. The final version of the report, represent
essentially a blue-print for LSWC's future institutional development and
reorientation. The new organization chart of LSWC, reflecting changes
suggested in the LDE report, is shown at Annex 1-3, Attachment 2. LSWC has
been reorganized according to the four functional areas of Engineering,
Technical, Finance and Administration each headed by an Assistant General
Manager. The number of controllers has been increased to nine and new
Divisional and Zonal arrangements are being set up to enable LSWC to be
more responsive to the needs of its customers on a localized basis. This
is particularly important while the distribution system is being expanded
and the new billing and colleetion systems are being installed.
F. Manpower and Training
1.11      As of mid-86 LSWC employed 1,450 staff of which about 60 have
university or technical qualifications and training. The bulk of these
have been with the Corporation for many years and have come up through the
LASG civil service. In anticipation of the substantially increased



- 5 -
workload and the need to broaden the experience and skills profile of its
staffing, LSWC is presently recruiting qualified staff to reinforce the
middle management positions and to cope with activities in areas hitherto
neglected - training, accounting, billing and collection and data
processing. LSWC has organized some in-house training in the past. The
proposed project will provide the Corporation with a framework for the
continuing development of its manpower through a program which has already
been prepared and appraised. This will, inter alia, comprise exte-nsive in
house training courses recently defined and to be carried out with the help
of training experts and supplemented by overseas training scholarships. To
ensure the continuation of manpower training and development, it would be
agreed during negotiations that LSWC will provide 2% of its annual
personnel budget to recurrent costs of training (para 3.01). It is
envisaged that institutional development will be reinforced by technical
assistance being provided through a twinning arrangement with a foreign
water utility (Annex 1-3, para 32).
G. Financial Position
1. Accounting, Audit and Insurance
1.12      LSWC operates a basic receipts and payments system inherited from
Government. Because assets and liabilities were not formally catalogued
and transferred to LSWC when it was created in 1980, the external auditors
were not able to give an opinion on the 1981 annual accounts. Never-
theless, Audit Reports through December 31, 1985 were reviewed and are
satisfactory. In 1986, the situation has improved as LSWC has appointed a
qualified accountant as Controller of Finance and LDE has identified and
valued LSWC's assets as part of the Organization anid Management Study. The
implementation of accruals accounting syatems based on commercial
principles during 1986 and 1987 has progressively enhanced financial
accounting, reporting and auditing. For FY86 and -nwards annual accounts
will be independently audited, by an auditor ac,cptable to the Bank, and
submitted to the Bank within 6 months of the year end. The Corporation
carries no insurance except for its vehicles, but will expand its coverage
as its revenue generating performance improves. Assets procured under the
project will be insured.
2. Recent Financial Performance
1.13      Since inception, LSWC has not generated sufficient revenues to
meet its operating expenditures (N10.9 million in FY88), the balance has
been met by recurrent subvention and direct payments from LASG. LASG is
anxious to phase out this financial support for recurrent expenditures to
LSWC and has set a target date of about 1990 for this objective (see
para 1.17). In 1988, personnel costs are expected to account for 17% of
recurrent expenses which is down from 36% in 1983; electricity and fuel
10%, chemicals about 44% (up from about 25% in 1985 due to realignment of
the Naira) and repairs and maintenance accounts for the balance of 29%.
LSWC carries no debt servicing obligations, has made no provision for
depreciation of its assets until FY86 and depends entirely upon LASG for



- 6 -
its capital investment needs. Improvement of LSWC's financial performance
is an important objective of the project (paras 1.17 and 1.18).
3. Billing and Collection
1.14      LSWC has relied for its revenues mainly on bulk charges to the
eight municipalities in Lagos State, on directly negotiated bills to about
800 major consumers and on connection charges. Until 1986, LSWC did not
typically receive the municipal bulk charge payments via LASG and those for
recurrent subvention in a timely fashion. Assurances were obtained during
negotiations that these payments will be ktnt up to date throughout project
implementation (para 3.01). Although LSWC had several thousand in talled
meters, this basis of charging was abandoned in 1973. This decision has
been reversed and LSWC is now actively installing over 100 meters per month
and has enumerated some 14,000 industrial and commercial orgarizations, of
which about 8,000 are supplied by LSWC, but many have their own groundwater
or alternative supplies. Metering as a basis of charging for water use is
being expanded and will replace the negotiated price contracts. The
metering policy is beiug extended to industrial and commercial consumers
and to the high water users in low density domestic premises - metering of
domestic supplies in most medium to high density areas is not envisaged at
this stage. This action together with a new tariff structure and recently
increased levels of charge (see para 1.15) will substantially improve
revenue generation. However, LSWC has a long way to go. It presently uses
4 old keyboard accounting machines, which are adequate for its present
billing arrangements but will not be able to cope with its enhanced billing
and collection activity beyond 1988. It is estimated that there are
approximately 83,000 direct consumer connections in Lagos State. LSWC will
install computer facilities under the project and enlist the support of a
local data processing bureau for these high volume transactions during
1989, while developtig Its own staffing and billing and collection systems.
LSWC's commercial development plan for the proposed project ani beyond
including enumeration of existing customers, was received and reviewed by
the Bank in November 1987.
4. Tariffs
1.15      LASG approved a new tariff structure effective January 1, 1986
for LSWC). The levels of charge were increased by about 80% for domestic
consumers, marginally for Government and its institutions and by about 40X
for industrial and commercial consumers. Direct charges have been
introduced for the first time for water sold at public standposts for which
a vendor licensing system is under discussion. The new structure provides
a reasonable relationship between different classes of consumer and is a
good basis upon which LSWC can commence direct billing. A further tariff
increase averaging about 270% is presenti; in the process of approval by
LASG and confirmation is expected during April 1988 (Annex 1-4). The new
charges will be somewhat higher than those being applied in other states of
Nigeria. Further work will be carried out on the structure of tariffs, and
average increases during the execution of the proposed project are expected
to approximate to domestic inflation. The tariff implementation strategy
and economics of tariffs are discussed in paras 1.16 and 2.23 respectively.



- 7-
H. Future Financial Performance
1.16      A key to LSWC's future financial peformance is the rate at which
it can develop and implement its direct billing system for all consumers,
keep up with its new connection and metering program and the extent to
which the State Government honors its undertaking to approve appropriate,
timely tariff increases for LSWC. During negotiations, an undertaking was
obtained from LASG that it will agree annually in advance the level of
tariffs, recurrent expenses subvention and debt service support to LSWC
(para 3.01) to enable LSWC to meet its financial objectives (para 1.18). A
major focus of the project is expe&t assistance to be provided to LSWC in
the areas of commercial and financial activities to help realise the
improved financial performance. Unaccounted-for water, often a major
factor in determining a water utility's financial performance in West
Africa, is also significant for Lagos. All the calculations point towlards
an estimated figure of 30% at the present time after allowing for
production losses. An effective waste detection program will need to await
the installation of new meters to give improved information regarding
production and distribution flows and the system brought under control, on
an area by area basis during implementation of the project.
1.17      Using the assumptions in Annex 1-5, forecasts have been made for
LSWC's financial statements (Income and Funds Plow Statements and Balance
Sheets) which are set out in detail in Annexes 1-6, 1-7 and 1-8. The
financial forecasts have been made in US dollars for FY88 onwards using an
estimated exchange rate of N 1 - US$0.23. The strategy for improving
LSWC's financial performance is that:
(a)  LSWC will gradually meet all its cash operating costs by
1991, th*is eliminating the need for State Government
recurrent subvention;
(b)  LSWC will meet debt servicing on all external financing.
As this can only be achieved over time concomitant with the
improved financial performance of LSWC, LASG has agreed to
provide the shortfall in debt servicing needs (paras 1.20
and 1.21) over and above that part generated by LSWC; and
(c)  LSWC will not incur any debt unless its net revenues are at
least 1.5 times its estimated maximum debt service
requirements.
1.18      The specific financial targets are that LSWC would be required to
meet 100% of its cash operating expenses by FY91 with Intermediate targets
of 50S in FY89 and 75% in FY90. By FY95, LSWC would be expected to meet
its total cash operating expenses and depreciation or debt servicing
requirements, whichever is the higher, with intermediate targets of 602 in
FY92, 75Z in FY93 and 90X in FY94. Such a strategy would also achieve a
positive rate of return on average currently valued net assets in operation
by the end of project execution in FY96. Substantial tariff increases are



- 8 -
Implied by thoe financial targets, raising average tariffs from US$0.41/m3
in FY88 to about US$0.76/m9 in Y96. This reflects the catch-up situation
from the present low tariffs as well as the impact of realignment of the
Nigerian currency and Its Impact on imported chemicals and replacement cost
of assets.
1.19     The salient features of LSWC's future financial peformance are
expected to be as shown in the following table. The current ratio is
adversely affected in the early years by the provision for short-term
maturity of long-term debt. The debt vs equity ratio will be satisfactory
at around 0.79 towards the end of the project period. In 1996, the
Corporation could, for the first time, generate sufficient income to cover
operating and non-operating costs and possibly be in a position to
contribute towards the second phase of its investment program. It was
agroed during negotiations that LSWC would not incur capital investment
without prior Bank review or additional borrowing without revenues being at
least 1.5 ties debt service requirements.

The bulk of the capital investment for new installations, was on account of
ten "imini-waterworks", (See Annex 1-1) and expansion of the Iju treatment
plant. Given IASG capital expenditure budget, which averaged about
N400 million annually over the 1981-85 period this level of investment was
not particularly high. In view of the foregoing and the fact that Lagos
State Government's revenue generating base is rather broad, and comparative-
ly less volatile than that of other states, - over 75% of its annual
revenue is internally generated with the rest originating from the federal
statutory allocation - the counterpart funding problem, frequently
encountered in other States of the Federation, should not be an issue. As
a safeguard, however, LASG has provided an undertaking during negotiations
that it will provide counterpart funds quarterly in advance into LSWC's
Project Counterpart Fund Account (para 3.01).
1.21      Indicated below are the estimated total annual funding
requirements from LASG during the project period.

The estimated total counterpart funding requirement in the peak year of
1988 represents 13% of the State Government's budget, mostly represented by
the 15% downpayment on the Degremont and Sogea contracts which has already
been deposited with the Central Bank. For other years LASG support of the
project (local cost funding) and LSWC (recurrent subvention and debt
service support) gradually declines each year for FY89 onwards, but is
dependent upon LASG providing LSWC with adequate tariffs to generate
revenue internally to take on its commitments. LSWC would require debt
service support until 1994, which would peak at US$33.4 million equivalent
in 1991, for which assurances were obtained from LASG during negotiations
(para 3.01). In 1995, the Corporation could, for the first time, generate
sufficient income to cover operating and non-operating costs and possibly
be in a position to contribute towards its investment program.
BANK GROUP STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR INVOLVEMENT
J. Role of the Bank
1.22      The Bank Group's water sector strategy for Nigeria is set out in
the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Memorandum (Report No 4696-UNI dated
October 30, 1984). At the Federal level the Bank is working with the
Government to establish common accounting, cost recovery and national
training policies through a water sector rehabilitation project which is
currently being prepared - access to funds for rehabilitation would only be
approved for those states willing to undertake such sectoral policy
reforms. The Bank is also providing direct support in three states
Kaduna, Anambra and Borno; through this project direct support will be
provided to a fourth state, Lagos. The Bank has become involved only in
those States which have requested the Bank's assistance through the Federal
Government. There are no completed projects in the sector yet. The main
problems to date have been related to cost recovery and delays in tariff
increases. With the Bank's intervention there have been some improvements
in billing and collection systems and increased awareness by State
Governments that by improving the financial performance of State Water
Utilities that Government recurrent subventions can be reduced. The Bank
was invited in 1984 by the Lagos State Government to help it define sector
investment priorities and to participate in financing the priority program.
The Bank's involvement in the project will enable achievement of the
project's objectives (para 2.01) and benefits (paras 1.05 and 2.21) and,
equally important, the mobilization of finance that may not otherwise have
become available. The mobilisation and co-ordination of the support of the
financing community represents an important contribution by the Bank to the
medium term development of public water supplies in Metropolitan Lagos.

II. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
2.01      The proposed project is intended to:
(a)  increase population access to public water supplies
(doubling of production capacity and primary, secondary and
tertiary distributioi network and more than doubling number
of direct connections);
(b) eliminate recurrent subvention support from LASG and thus,
indirectly, improve public expenditure policies;
(c) strengthen the executing agency LSWC, including divisional
operations, training iacilities and programs, manpower
management and accountability;
(d) improve the administrative efficiency of LSWC's operations
and maintenance (administrative infrastructure and support
services including offices, depots, workshops, stores,
vehicles, spare parts, rehabilitation of existing assets);
and,
(e) improve the economic efficiency, financial performance and
future viability of LSWC (cost reflecting tariff policy,
metering, billing and collection procedures, new accounting
systems).
B. Project Description
2.02      The proposed project, which is the first phase of a three phased
15 year expansion program is expected to be completed by September 30, 1994,
and to close March 31, 1995. It will consist of the following components
which are defined in more detail in Annex 2-1 and delineated on Map
IBID 19682:
(a) Expansion of Water Supply Facilities
(i)    An intake structure on the Ogun River at Akute, raw
water pumping station and 8.2 km of 1600 mm diameter
raw water main to a 320,000 m9/d treatment plant to
be constructed at Adiyan for flocculation,
clarification, aeration, rapid sand filtration,
disinfection, treated water pumping, transmission and
storage at Ok*-Aro reservoir (100,000 in) and standby
generators (the Degremont contract as shown on
Map IBRD 19776);



- 12 -
(b) Transmission and Distribution System
(i)    Laying of approximately 65.5 km of existing steel
pipes and fittings varying in diameter from 2,000 mm
to 800 mm from Adiyan waterworks to and within
metropolitan Lagos (SOBEA's contract); and supply and
laying of additional 14 km of pipeline of the same
range of sizes to improve access in the northern part
of the city;
(ii)   Supply and laying of approximately 280 km of
secondary pipeline ranging in sizes from 800 mm to
300 mm and 877 km of tertiary pipes of diameter
smaller than 300 mm together with valves and
fittings; and
(iii) Provision and installation of materials for
approximately 110,000 new service connuctions,
together with 75,000 meters (consumer as well as
production and zonal) and 420 additional public
standposts.
(c) Rehabilitation of Existing Systems
Mi)    Rehabilitation works including the anti-salinity weir
on the Ogun River to eliminate salt water intrusion;
the Ishasi watervorks; several mini waterworks to
bring them up to design output; rehabilitation of
about 94 km of pipelines including replacements for
defective valves and hydrants, and other spare parts
and materials appropriate for improving the
performance of LSWC's facilities.
(d) Administrative Infrastructure
(i)    Expansion, improvement and/or rehabilitation of
offices, workshops, depot and stores facilities and
housing for operating personnel;
(ii)   Provision of vehicles and mobile plant and workshop,
distribution system, communications and training
equipment and tools; and
(iii) Provision and installation of data processing
equipment.



- 13 -
(e) Institutional Support
(1)    Consultant services (940 man-months) for a hydraulic
analysis of the Lagos Metropolitan Area distribution
system; for detailed design of primary, secondary and
tertiary systems and supervision of construction of
Adiyan treatment plant and of the laying of primary,
secondary and tertiary mains and new service
connections;
(ii)   Technical support services (282 man-onths) to LSWC
in the areas of project management, accounting,
billing and collection, computing and data
processing, decentralisation  and operation and
maintenance;
(iii)  Development of training progra mes, training
consultancy, overseas secondment of LSVC staff for
training in key areas of activity and 60 man months
of training expert support (see Annex 2-2);
(iv)   12 months support for semi-annual Implementation
Planning and Review Workshops (para 2.12);
(v)    Studies of groundwater potential and usage and
development of appropriate sanitation technologies to
cope with increased to public water supplies; and
(vi)   An organization and management study of LSWC.
C. Project Costs
2.03      The estimated cost of the project expressed In and 1986 prices,
including provision for physical and price contingencies, but excluding
taxes and interest during construction, is US$461.8 million equivalent, as
summarized in the following table. The treatment of parastatals, even
within the same sector, regarding taxation is inconsistent and it has boen
confirmed recently that LSWC will be exempt from customs duties, taxes,
import surcharges and levies for importation of project related goods
financed by the World Bank, EIB, CIDA, UNDP and the French Comercial
Banks. The foreign exchange cost of US$413.2 million equivalent represents
about 89X of the project cost, full details of which are given in
Annex 2-3.

2.04      The project costs include 10% physical contingencies except for
the Adiyan waterworks and the primary main laying contracts, which have
already been awarded to the French contractors Degremont and SOBEA
respectively (para 2.08). Price escalation has been included at 6.8% in
1987, gradually reducing to 4% in 1991 and subsequent years. Given the
transition from a fixed to a floating Naira exchange rate during project
preparation, all costs were estimated in US dollar, as the Naira exchange
rate was very erratic. The total allowatice for inflation is based on an
implementation period of eight years, which is the present average length
for water supply projects in West Africa.
2.05      Costs of project components other than the Adiyan waterworks and
the primary mains have been estimated by taking into account current
quotations for similar work or provision of services, manufacturers' supply
quotations and tendered rates from previous contracts. Lengths of primary
and secondary pipes have been estimated from comprehensive hydraulic
analysis of the distribution system and preliminary surveys of the physical
conditions of the existing pipe system. Estimates for the tertiary network
have been derived by analysing, in detail, the tertiary network
requirements for four sample areas (PCUs) and projecting the results
statistically to the complete tertiary system. Field checks will be made
during detailed design to confirm the projections. Canadian financed
consultants are commencing this work in April 1988.



- 15 -
2.06      The foreign exchange component of project costs was estimated by
assuming that virtually all pipe contracts, except for some small diameter
asbestos cement pipes which are manufactured in Nigeria, would be won by
foreign firms. Foreign, but locally established contractors, are expected
to win most of the civil works contracts. Nevertheless the foreign
exchange component of these works will still be high, estimated at 90%,
because the contractors to be involved will likely rely extensively on
imported equipment and expatriate supervisory staff.
D. Project Financing and Lending Arrangements
2.07      An IBRD loan of US$173.2 million equivalent is proposed, and
would finance about 38% of project costs, for parts of the transmission and
distribution mains systems, including new service connections,
rehabilitation, administrative infrastructure, consultant and technical
support personnel and training. Retroactive financing of expenditures
incurred after May 31, 1986 (estimated at US$2.0 million) and not forming
part of the Bank's PPF Advances (US$1.5 million) is recommended. As far as
possible the Bank has provided for local costs financing (US$20.2 million)
to offset the US$29.1 million in foreign exchange to be provided by LASG
(see para 2.09).
2.08      Substantial co-financing is required by the project.  An amount
of US$164.8 million equivalent is to be made available by French Commercial
Banks at an estimated 8.75% annual interest rate, repayable over 11 years
(including 3 years of grace), and guaranteed by COFACE. This amount would
finance two contracts awarded to French contractors (Degremont and SOBEA),
who will construct the Adiyan Treatment Plant facilities and lay 65.5 km of
primary mains.  The proposed level of commercial financing in the project
is approximately 6-8% of the likely new external commercial funds required
by Nigeria to support its structural adjustment programme and is reasonable
and sustainable. EIB is expected to participate with a loan of
US$47.4 million equivalent repayable over 18 years (including 5 years of
grace) at an estimated annual interest rate of 5%. Effectiveness of the
French Commercial Bank loans and the EIB loan would be a condition of
effectiveness of the IBRD loan (para 3.02). CIDA has agreed to provide a
grant of CDN$4.5 million (US$3.2 million approx) to finance the detailed
design of the secondary and tertiary system. UNDP provided a grant of
US$0.6 million to finance the LSWC organization and management study
carried out by LDE. Financing arrangements, which were coordinated by IBRD
at the request of LASG, are as follows:

2.09      IBRD and EIB funds would be lent to FGN, onlent to LASG and
relent to LSWC for the same periods and on the same terms as from the
funding institutions.  A condition of loan effectiveness would be that the
conditions precedent to effectiveness of the EIB loan and the French
Commercial Bank loans have been met. Credit agreemeants were signed with
French Commercial Banks, which are guaranteed by COFACE, on December 30,
1987. LASG is required to pay 15% of the foreign exchange cost of the
Degremont and SOBEA contracts (US$29.1 million). The execution of
satisfactory subsidiary loan agreements between FGN and LASG and between
LASG and LSWC would be a condition of respective loan effectiveness (para
3.02). The commercial bank loans would be lent to LASG with a guarantee
from FGN. Counterpart funds from LASG to LSWC would be treated as equity
contribution. LSWC would carry the foreign exchange risk on all loans.
Similarly, CIDA and UNDP grants to FGN will be converted by LASG into LSWC
equity. LASG would assume responsibility for any cost overruns.
E. Project Implementation
1. Status of Preparation and Execution
2.10      Project preparation has progressed slowly but satisfactorily
through the IBRD PPF financing of the hydraulic analysis of the trans-
mission and distribution system by GKW Consult of Germany; the UNDP
financing of the LSWC otganization and management study by LDE, and, CIDA
financing of consultants to carry out the detailed design of the secondary
and tertiary distribution system. PPF Advances totalling US$1.5 million
will also be used to meet the initial foreign costs of consultants for the
supervision of the Adiyan Treatment Plant and the laying of primary mains,
for detailed design of an additional 14 km of primary mains, for project
management support and for training.



- 17 -
2.11      Implementation of the proJect, in accordance with the schedule
set out in Annex 2-4, will be carried out by LSWC, with assistance from
consultants and an experienced water utility, and according to plans
developed by LSWC staff during semi-annual project implementation planning
and review workshops. The consultants will be utilized to supervise the
Adiyan construction and primary main laying contracts as well as the
procurement and laying of pipes and fittings for the secondary and tertiary
main laying and service connection programs. Staff of an experienced water
utility will be used to provide technical support to LSWC in the areas of
project management, billing and collection, data processing, accounting and
training and implementing LSWC's decentralisation policy. Steps will be
taken soon by LSWC to enter into a technical cooperation and twinning
arrangement w4th an experienced water utility.
2.12      The objectives of the implementation workshops will be (i) for
LSWC staff to translate the broad implementation strategy outlined by LDE
into detailed six month action programs and (ii) introduce a method which
staff can use within their departments and sections to develop work
programs. Initially, the workshops will be designed to be run by technical
experts who would train a Nigerian (preferably an LSWC staff member so as
to develop in-house capability), so that by year 3, no further outside
assistance would be necessary. The first of these workshops is proposed to
be held during 1988. At about the date of effectiveness, a Project Launch
Workshop (PLW), will be held. The PLW, a structured project start-up
activity, will bring together the key staff members of LSWC and
coordinating ministries to review the project objectives and procedures and
to discuss in detail the sequence of implementation activities. Overall,
LSWC has been very enthusiastic and energetic in preparing the proposed
project and has the active support of LASG, which augurs well for
implementation.
2. Procurement

al Turnkey contracts for Adiyan Treatment plant and primary mains.
Notes regarding IBRD financed components:
a.   A prior Bank review would be required for awards of all IBRD-financed
civil works contracts above US$0.5 million equivalent and equipment
contracts above US$0.1 million equivalent.
b.   All civil works (inc. rehabilitation) contracts above US$3.0 million
equivalent and equipment (inc. pipes, fittings, vehicles, spare parts)
contracts above US$0.5 million financed by IBRD would be awarded on
the basis of ICB in accordance with World Bank Guidelines. For the
purpose of bid evaluation, the domestic prefereace margtin would be 15%
(or applicable import duty, whichever is lower) for goods manufactured
locally.
c.   Items, which cannot be grouped into packages of the size indicated in
note (b), will be awarded on the basis of LCB under local procurement
procedures acceptable to the Bank, except packages of a value less
than US$100,000 equivalent which will be awarded on the basis of at
least three priced quotations. Such local shopping will not exceed
US$2.0 million in aggregate and be agreed annually in advance with
IBRD.



- 19 -
d.   Installation of domestic service connections worth about
US$2.0 million equivalent will be carried out by LSWC by force
account. The quantity of work involved cannot be defined in advance
as the works are mostly small and scattered or in different locations
where mobilization costs for contractors would be high and the work
must be carried out witnout disrupting ongoing operations of LSWC.
e.   All contracts for consultant and technical support personnel would be
awarded on the basis of Bank guidelines for the selection of
consultants. Consultants and contractors would be provided with
dispensation from indigenisation for the period of execution of their
contracts.
3. Disbursements
2.14      The proposed project will be substantially completed by
September 30, 1995, and the IBRD loan disbursed by March 31, 1996 in
accordance with the estimated schedule in Annex 2-6 which approximates to
the Bank's Western Africa Water Sector Profile. Disbursements of the IBRD
loan are estimated as follows:

Disbursements for force account civil works, civil wmorks contracts of less

$20,000 equivalent, will be made against statements of expenditure (SOEs).
Supporting documents related to these items will be retained by LSWC and



- 20 -
made available for review by visiting missions, and LSWC audit reports
(para 1.12) will include an opinion concerning proper utilization of funds
under the SOE and Special Account, procedures (para 2.15). Other
Disbursements will be made against full documentation (signed contracts,
progress reports/invoices, evidence of shipment, and evidence of payment
for reimbursement requests).
2.15      To facilitate project implementation, a foreign currency Special
Account with an authorized allocation of US$2.0 million will be established
and maintained by LSWC in a commercial bank on terms and conditions
acceptable to the Bank. However, the initial request would be for
US$1.0 million to be deposited in the account - the additional
US$1.0 million would depend on the provision by the Government of adequate
justification of the need for additional funds as well as the experience
with the use of the initial deposit of US$1.0 million. The Special account
will be used to meet the eligible percentage of both foreign and local
expenditures. Replenishment of the account will be subject to submission
of appropriate supporting documents as outlined above. Replenishment
applications will be submitted on a monthly basis, or when amounts
withdrawn are equivalent to one-third of the amount deposited; the minimum
reimbursement application size for this project will be US$200,000. All
direct payments of less than US$50,000 will be made from the Special
A-count.
4. Project Management
2.16      LSWC has set up a separate department which will function as the
project unit to co-ordinate project implementation within the new
Engineering Directorate. The department is headed by a well qualified
engineer who underwent specialist project management training. Qualified
staff will be seconded from other departments of the Corporation or
recruited externally. Provision has been made in the Corporation's budget
to hire additional staff. LSWC expects expansion of the public water
supply system to continue for about 15 years and it will therefore need the
services of such staff for a long time to come. A substantial number of
staff will be seconded to work with consultants and contractors as part of
the knowledge transfer program, so that LSWC may develop its own expertise
- the assignment of counterpart staff will be continuously monitored and
assurances were received during negotiations confirming such program
staffing. It is envisaged that the project department would have external
support in project management and procurement logistics under the proposed
project.
5. Environmental Aspects
2.17      The project is not expected to have any adverse environmental
impact, although there will be increased wastewater flows. However, in
view of the heavy local rainfall during the rainy season, the additional
flow will have no significant impact on the performance of the major
primary network of storm drainage being implemented through direct efforts
of LASG and under the Bank assisted Solid Waste and Storm Drainage Project
(para 1.07). Some of the increased wastewater flows will require attention
at the local level during the dry season, where their disposal could be



- 21 -
integrated as a temporary measure either into the secondary and tertiary
storm drainage systems (in some places yet to be designed) or into the
sanitation system. Another possible consequence of the project is an
increased demand for improved sanitation arising from the higher living
standards and housing values that are likely to result from the project.
Studies will be undertaken as part of the project to develop a framework
for strategic planning for zonal sanitation using different types of
sanitation technologies to fit the level of service for water supply
envisaged in the various Planning Control Unit areas (Annex 1-2 para 7).
2.18      Water withdrawals from the Ogun River will not significantly
affect stream flows since these are controlled by releases from the Oyan
Dam upstream. Under the abstraction licence arrangement, OORBDA will have
a guaging station upstream of LSWC's intake on the River Ogun, which will
be monitored to ensure adequate flow in the river. LSWC will also monitor
the flow to ensure that adequate quantities of water are released to
augment natural flows picked up in the 170 km from the dam to the intake.
2.19      None of the proposed investments will require relocation of
authorised residents, as land has already been secured. Occupied land
originally identified for some of the primary mains has been avoided by
rerouting the system.  Only land for temporary pipe storage has yet to be
acquired.  There will be periodic short-term interference with traffic
flows occasioned by mainlaying in different parts of Metropolitan Lagos.
The minimisation of traffic disruption will be included in the bid
documents for the secondary and tertiary distribution system mainlaying.
F. Monitoring and Reporting
2.20      The Project Department of LSWC will monitor project execution.
Detailed project monitoring and reporting has been discussed with LSWC.
The monitoring indicators to be used - physical, financial and operational
- are included in Annex 2-7.
G. Project Justification and Risks
1. Economic Returns and Costs
2.21      The proposed project, which is the first of three similar sized
phases, each providing 320,000 ml/day of production capacity, represents
the least cost solution. Several alternatives were considered to explore
whether different phasing or a smaller project would be a better option -
the analysis showed that the proposed scope is the optimal size. Smaller
plant sizes resulted in higher average incremental costs of production and
lower rates of return due to relatively high fixed investment costs, lower
production and consumption levels and delays necessitated by plant
redesign. The economic rate of return of the proposed project is 13%,
although the sensitivity anAlysis produced results ranging from 10 to 17%
(Annex 2-8). The lower figure (101) assumes a 101 reductiou in benefits



- 22 -
with production at 85% of maximum designed capacity and a 10% increase in
project costs; the higher figure (17%), assumes construction schedules as
planned, 100% capacity output and cost savings of 10%.
2.22      Such high economic returns can be explained by the acute scarcity
of public water supplies in Lagos, as can be inferred from the following
data for 1985 and the expected contribution of the project to public
supplies on its completion:
1985         1995
Population, millions                              6.3           9.9
Population served, millions                       2.9           6.5
Built-up Area, ha                              29,833        32,003
Built-up Area with Service, ha                 14,257        24,400
Demand for Water, Mm9/year                      314.7         539.7
Demand Met, Mm3/year                             60.2         190.8
Currently, less than half the population, and less than half the area of
Metropolitan Lagos has access to public supplies, owing to a backlog of
more than 20 years in water supply investment in water works capacity and
distribution networks. The attached Map IBRD 19683 shows the areas with
and without service and those to be serviced by the proposed project. Only
20% of current demand is being met, and only then irregularly. Although
the project would greatly increase supply capacity, and the area and
population served, there would still be a substantial shortfall in supplies
on its completion by 1995. (Four PCUs would not receive any service at all
under the project).
2.23      The costs to households and to industry of obtaining water from
alternative sources are significantly in excess of the marginal costs of
providing them with publ.c supplies.  A profile survey of 878 households
(1985) found that over three million residents are paying in the range of
N1.5 to N4.0 per cubic meter of water for general purposes, with potable
water costing N4 to Nil per cubic meter, depending on the quantity
purchased; in addition there are significant expenditures of time and
effort on fetching and carrying water from stavApipes, wells and other
sources in many parts of the city.  The costs to households were N2.2/mi  in
1985 (N2.7/mW  in 1987 prices).  In contrast, public supplies, under the
proposed project, could be provided at an economical (and also financial)
cost-reflecting tariff of about N1.0 per cubic meter (1987 constant
prices). The large majority of industrial users have their own supplies
from boreholes tapping the second, third and fourth acquifers at depths of
60, 120 and 500 meters respectively. The private supply costs are
estimated to range from N0.2 to 0.5/mi  for the second and third acquifer
and N1.2 to 2.5/m9 for the fourth acquifer (see Annex 2-8); however, the
tappings on the second and, possibly, third acquifers are thought to be
approaching the acquifers' sustainable capacities. For the foregoing



- 23 -
reasons, the estimates of the economic returns are based on an observed
willingness-to-pay of N2.2/ms for households and an estimated
willingness-to-pay of N1.0m9 for industrial users, a weighted average
willingness-to-pay of N2.39/mi  in 1987 constant prices.
2.   Poverty Impact and Design
2.24      As shown in para 2.22, 3.4 million residents of Lagos are without
access to a public water supply. Their average cost of water of N1.5 to
N4.0/m9 (1985 prices) excludes the significant costs of the family's own
labor required for fetching and carrying water: a low income family
consuming 30 lcd (sigaificantly below the basic needs level of 50-100 lcd
for drinking, cooking, washing and sanitation) fetches six tons of water
over distances of 300 meters or more (Annex Z-8) per month. Proposed
tariffs (para 1.18) therefore are not seen as being a net drain on average
household incomes. The emphasis of the proposed project is on expanding
service to low income areas as shown in the following summary of the
expected distribution of supplies:
.ncom  G a/------ 1995 Population ---    Projected Water
Income Group a            Total     Served      Unserved     Allocations b/

to "R2" areas, lower income to "R3" areas and low income to "R4"
areas. See Annex 1-2 for definition of R1, R2, R3 and R4.
b/   Assuming 30% losses.
c/  Of which about 2.2 million (out of 5.8 million) would be served via
standposts.
Hence the project would increase supplies substantially to low income
groups; roughly, 3.6 million residents who do not have access to service
now would receive it, of which 2.2 million, or 61%, would be in the low
income areas. By the end of the project period low income residents would
account for about 16% of total public water supply consumption.

3. Project Risks
2.25      The sensitivity analysis considered a combination of a 10% change
in costs and benefits with water works operating at either 85% or 100% of
capacity. As noted above, such occurrences would reduce the lowest
expected ERR to about 10X. The risks of the project, however, do not
relate to its economic viability but to LSWC not being placed in a position
to oversee its satisfactory implementation and management (para 1.10). For
this reason heavy emphasis is being placed on the development of LSWC in
its four functional areas of Engineering, Technical, Finance and
Administration and increased delegation within LSWC. Improved billing and
collection of a full economic, cost reflecting tariff policy as well as
greater efficiency in operations and maintenance will be the main platforms
for improved financial performance. The whole transitional process will be
underpinned by a comprehensive manpower development and training programme
across all levels as well as technical support from a more developed water
utility. Furthermore, it was agreed with LASG during negotiations that
LSWC has greater autonomy in the management of water supply investment and
operating decisions. These administrative reforms are considered crucial
for both the success of the project and for the future development of the
water supply system in Lagos. As noted in para 1.09, LASG has approved a
phased scheme of delegation to LSWC for contract award and payment
authorizations.
III. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
3.01      During negotiations it was agreed that:
(a) Federal Government of Nigeria would clarify the status of
LASG/LSWC regarding customs duties, taxes import surcharges
and levies for importation of project related goods financed
by IBRD, EIB, CIDA, UNDP, and French Commercial Banks (para
2.03). This was provided by letter dated February 29, 1988
from FGN to the Governor of Lagos State.
(b) Lagos State Government will:
(i)    annually agree with LSWC the level of tariffs,
recurrent subvention, and debt service support to
LSWC (para 1.16) to enable the Corporation to meet
with annually increasing financial targets
(para 1.18); and
(ii)   provide, as equity in LSWC, the funds to replenish
the LSWC counterpart fund account quarterly in
advance to enable LSWC to make all payments under the
project (para 1.20); and



- 25 -
(c) Lagos State Water Corporation will:
(i)    obtain an abstraction licence from OORBDA for 640,000
m9/d out of the River Ogun (para 1.03);
(ii)   provide 2% per annum of its Personnel budget for
training of LSWC staff (para 1.11);
(iii)  appoint independent auditors acceptable to the Bank,
for auditing LSWC's FY86 and subsequent years' annual
accounts (para 1.12);
(iv)   implement the commercial development plan dated
November 1987, including consumer enumeration
(para 1.14);
(v)    meet 100% of its cash operating expenses by FY91 with
intermediate targets of 501 in FY89 and 75% in FY90,
and by FY95 meet total cash operating expenses and
depreciation, or debt service, whichever is the
higher with intermediate targets of 60% in FY92, 75%
in FY93 and 90% in FY94 (para 1.18);
(vi)   prior to new borrowings, ensure that its net revenues
coyer debt service requirements 1.5 times (para
1.19);
Cvii)  mobilize adequate numbers of counterpart staff to
work with consultants and contractors as part of the
knowledge transfer program (para 2.16); and
(viii) monitor and report on project execution (para 2.20).
3.02      Apart from the provision of legal opinions on the several
agreements, execution of subsidiary loan agreements between FGN and LASG
and between LASG and LSWC, and the fulfillment of all conditions precedent
to effectiveness of the EIB loan and the French Commercial Bank loans would
be conditions of effectiveness (paras 2.08 and 2.09).
Recommendation
3.03      On the basis of the above actions and agreements, the proposed
project would be suitable for an IBRD loan of US$173.2 million.

NIGERIA
LAGOS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
COUNTRY AND SECTOR BACKGROUND INCLUDING EXISTING SYSTEM
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Country Background
1.        Located between latitude 4°N and 13°N and having a land area of
approximately 923,000 kM2, Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa
with over 90 million inhabitants. The last official census was in 1963
when the population was 56 million and present estimates are extrapolations
from this figure.  There are 21 states and the Federal Capital Territory
constituting the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria. (See Map IBRD
20026).
2.        The economy was, until about 15 years ago, dominated by
agriculture. The buoyant oil market over the 1973-80 period dramatically
shifted Nigeria's economy from predominant dependence on the agricultural
sector to almost complete dependence on the oil sector by the beginning of
the 1980's. By 1980, oil earnings accounted for 96% of exports and over
80o of Federal Government revenues while the agricultural sector's share of
non-oil GDP fell to 30% from around 50% in the early 1970'8.
3.        Nigeria was ill-equipped politically, administratively and
structurally to deal with the abrupt end of the oil boom in 1981. Partly
because of expectations that the downturn would be short-lived, the Federal
and State Governments reacted only slowly to the falling oil revenues:
measures aimed at curbing and redirecting expenditures were insufficient.
Consequently, sizeable external and fiscal imbalances emerged; external
reserves fell and at the same time there was a large-scale accumulation of
arrears on top of substantial public borrowings to finance investment
programs. The policy reforms included in the Federal Government's 1986
budget provided a starting point for structural adjustment. Energy prices
were increased significantly and a good start made on public expenditure
and parastatal reforms. However, the 1986 oil price collapse further
jolted the Nigerian economy.
4.        Building on the 1986 Budget reforms, Nigeria has now formulated a
growth-oriented medium term policy package. The package includes the
following priority reforms: liberalization of the foreign exchange market;
diversification of the economy by developing the productive non-oil
sectors, particularly agriculture; pressing on with reform on parastatals
and improving the efficiency of the public sector; the promotion of the
private sector, and a further rationalization of the public expenditure
program. This medium term adjustment programme is the basis for Nigeria's
stabillsation and development, of which the propoeed project is a part.

Lagos State Background
5.        Lagos State, at the southwestern corner of the country is, in
area, the smallest of the States covering some 5,000 kW2. Numerous creeks
and lagoo.s cover the low lying terrain which rises from the ocean to a
maximum elevation of only 50 meters at the inland boundary of the State.
Mean monthly temperatures in Lagos range from 24°C to 29'C and relative
humidity 65 to 87%. Average precipitation is approximately 2,500 mm per
annum. Although a new federal capital has been created at Abuja, Lagos
continues to be the commercial and industrial capital of Nigeria.
6.        Metropolitan Lagos, with a population estimated at over 6
million, accounts for approximately 90% of the State's population. High.
natural growth rate combined with immigration from rural to urban areas
have resulted in rapid population growth that is currently estimated to
continue at about 4.5% per annum. The rapid population growth has placed
severe strains on the public water supply system. Both production and
distribution capacities are inadequate to meet demand.
Sector Background
7.        Under Nigerian's federal system of Government, the individual
states have the primary responsibility for the development of the water
supply and waste disposal sector. Linkages between the state water
utilities and the Federal Government, which are through the Department of
Water Resources in the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Rural
Development (FMAWRRD), are weak and not formalised.
8.        The Lagos State Water Corporation (LSWC), previously Lagos State
Water Management Board (LSWMB), has statewide responsibility for public
water supply. Established as a separate corporate body in 1980, LSWC is
attached to the Military Governor's office.
9.        Drinking water supplies in Lagos State are drawn from both
surface and underground sources. There are two principal surface source
facilities (i) the Iju waterworks which has a rated capacity of 204,570
m9/d (45 mgd Imperial) and relies on raw water from Ogun River (90%) and
the Iju River (10%) and (ii) the Ishasi waterworks of 18,000 m9/d (4.0 mgd
Imperial) capacity which draws raw water from the Ovo River. A river
regulation dam, the Oyan Dam, guarantees minimum flows capable of meeting
anticipated water needs of Lagos through 2000. In 1980, the State Govern-
ment embarked on the construction of 10 mini waterworks, which draw on
groundwater, to augmenlt supplies on a localised basis. The combined
capacity of these 10 mini waterworks is 120,000 ms/d (26.4 mgd). There is
limited groundwater potential - maximum reliable yield in the Lagos area
has been assessed at 477,330 m3/d (105 mgd) of which industry is estimated
to be abstracting about 363,680 ms/d (80 agd) and the 10 mini waterworks
another 120,000 m9/d (26.4 mgd). Metropolitan Lagos is supplied with water
from the two surface water treatment works at IJu and Ishasi and from seven
of the maini waterworks which have a capacity of 81,830 ms/d (18 mgd).

P8ge 3 of 5
Existing Treatment Facilities
10.       The Iju waterworks comprises two parallel treatment schemes, one
involving chemical flocculation/coagulation with hydraulically induced
mixing, gravity sedimentation and rapid sand filtration and the other,
flocculation/sedimentation with mechanical mixing, clarification through
upflow clarifiers and rapid sand filtration. The effluents are combined
and disinfected using chlorine. Raw water quality varies seasonally with
taste and odour becoming more manifest in the early part of the rainy
season (April/May).
11.       Treatment at the Ishasi Waterworks involves alum addition up-
stream of the upflow clarifiers; the clarified water is filtered through
low pressure, closed rapid sand filters and pumped through activated carbon
filters to remove color. Chlorine is added to the filtrate and the pH
adjusted with lime. Average daily production of these two surface water
facilities in 1984 was 143,788 m9/d compared with a design capacity of
222,750 m3/d (64.5%). Production efficiency is much higher at about 74%,
since the completion of the modernization work at Iju in 1985.
12.       The seven mini waterworks located in Metropolitan Lagos use
groundwater which is treated by aeration and sedimentation to remove
dissolved iron and disinfected for bacteriological control. Average daily
production of the mini waterworks in 1985 was 50,280 m9/d compared with a
design capacity of 81,830 m3/d (61%). Rehabilitation works under the
proposed project would aim to bring production in line with design
capacity.

Existing Transmission and Distribution System
13.       In addition to the production facilities, the existing water
supply system has about 106 km of transmission mains in diameters between
12 inch (305 mm) and 42 inch (1,067 mm) of asbestos cement, cast iron, and
steel pipes and between 500 mm and 800 mm of ductile iron. The 1,200 km
of distribution pipes are in cast iron, asbestos cement and PVC in
diameters ranging from 75 mm to 450mm. There are an estimated 83,312
consumer connections (metered and unmetered) and 2,800 stand posts serving
a total of 2.97 million people in 1985.
14.       The 29,000 m9 service reservoir at Iju treatment works iL  a
ground level reservoir with a maximum water surface elevation of 58 m. The
water from Ishasi waterworks is pumped over a distance of 18 km to an
elevated tank of 3,000 m9 at Pestac Village operating with a minimum water
level of 43 m above mean sea level. Elevated service tanks have been
constructed in various parts of the system to cope with localised peak
demands. All these tanks are designed to "float" on the system; they
fill during low demand periods and discharge during peak demand periods
to maintain flow. Their capacities are summarized below.

15.       Restricted transmission capacity and low pressures in the
distribution system are the major problems of the existing system.
Additionally, as there is no reliable information in the absence of
metering, system efficiency cannot be determined with any degree of
certainty. Rehabilitation of the oldest primary mains (Lines A and B) Is
expected to start shortly while the proposed project would undertake to
remedy some of the more serious bottlenecks in the distribution network.

LAGOS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
POPULATION AND SERVICE LEVELS FOR METROPOLITAN LAGOS
Present Service Levels and Demand for Water
1.  The existing capacities of both the waterworks and the distribution
networks are exceedingly small as compared to demand. After allowing for
losses of 30%, and also for 30% of supplies going to commercial, industrial
and various community and other non-household consumers, the amount
available for household consumers is about 155 million liters per day
(mld), or less than 25 lcd. This is substantially below what is considered
necessary to meet the population's basic requirements for drinking,
cooking, washing and sanitation, which would be around 50 to 100 lcd,
assuming water is used carefully.
2.   In fact, only about 47% of the population have access to public
supplies, 24% through house connections, 14% through a yard tap, and 9%
through a public standpipe or fountain. Attacbment 1 shows the current
water consumption levels and population served by district in Lagos, and

The decline in the lcd figure is due to the project serving a much larger
proportion of low income consumers than has been the case in the past; 5.8
million of f.5 million served will be in lower- and low-income categories,
as opposed to 2.6 million of the 2.9 million served at present.
3.        Surveys have found that those that de have access to public
service widely report on consistently low water pressures in the system,
resulting in the need for customers to supplement these supplies through
private sources such as tankers. For the preparation of the project, a
social survey was undertaken into household incomes, expenditures and the
consumption, uses and costs of water for a stratified random sample of 878
households. This showed that the remaining half of the population obtained
water through one or more of the following sources: "bucket vendors", 30%;
tankers, 11%; boreholes, 13%; wells, 40%; and rivers, streams, ponds,
places of work and stored rain water, 23% 1/. The lowest income families
(25% quartile) spend on average 3 to 7 hours per week collecting water, and
their expenditure on non public supplies (public supplies have not hitherto
been directly charged for) is in excess of 6% of total household
expenditure, working out at N2 to 3 per cubic meter consumed on average.
Perhaps the only positive sign from the survey was that the incidence of
water borne diseases appears to be low.
4.   The overall estimated average domestic water demand for the 1985
population of 6.31 million has been calculated at 416,000 m3/d. To this
have been added water requirements for industrial and commercial establish-
ments estimated at 51m3/ha/d and other special uses such as institutions,
hospitals, recreation centert, etc, at 13.5 ms/ha/d to arrive at the total
estimated water demand for 1985 of 862,000 m3/d including an allowance of
30 percent for total losses (Attachment 2). The design capacity of
existing water supply facilities is 301,500 m3/day; the available capacity,
after allowing for equipment failures, power outages (a significant
problem), is only 218,000 ms/day, or 25% of demand. Only 47% of the
population are served.
5.   Construction of the seven mini waterworks over the period 1981 to
1985, and the 10 mgd extension of Iju in 1985, have been the main ways in
which the Water Corporation has been able to accommodate increases in
demand, albeit to a very small extent. The transmission capacity of the
existing primary mains networks is also no greater than the delivery
capacity of the existing waterworks, since no significant investments have
been undertaken since 1962, at which time 26 km of primary mains were
completed (see map IBRD No. 19682R); since then, the population of
1/  The results are reported in "Domestic Water Use & Sanitation
Practices in Lagos (1985)". The percentages used in this
sentence add up to more than 100% because most people use more
than one source.

Page 3 of 6
Metropolitan Lagos has increased by nearly 5 million people and its area
has more than quadrupled.
6.        Turning to industrial, commercial and other non-household users
of water, surveys similarly show that only a minority receive, or can
depend upon, public supplies. The National Industrial Development Board
(NIDB) report that the financing of boreholes and pumps for private water
supplies is now a routine component of all their term loans to industry and
commerce, with boreholes being sunk to a depth of several hundred meters in
some cases. Such private supplies have done much to reduce the costs of
the failure of public services, for industry as for households. As
discussed in Annex 2-8, however, they are more costly than the incremental
costs of public supplies. In addition, the estimated sustainable yield of
the ground water tables is only about 105 mgd (see text para 1.03), while
industry alone is extracting around 80 mgd; further exploitation of this
source thus runs significant risks of salinating the water tables and will
be studied as part of the project.
Forecast Population and Service Level Assumptions
7.        For planning purposes Metropolitan Lagos has been mapped out and
divided into 24 'Planning Control Units' (PCUs), and the areas of and
populations in each PCU estimated (Attachment 1).  Household populations
were then classified according to type and quality of residence, from which
estimates of demand could be made using the following consumption rates:
high income households, with pipe connections, over 225 lcd; middle income
households with pipe connection£, 110 lcd; lower income households with
pipe connections, 70 lcd; and low income households with access to stand-
pipes or sharing connections, 25-50 lcd (Attachment 3). The number of
households without public services was also estimated. This method of
estimating demand is reasonable in the absence of any figures on historical
levels and trends in consumption rates being available (owing to
inadequacies in system metering, and no billing and revenue collection
system being in place), and the figures are (a) consistent with experience
in other countries, and (b) in the case of low income households are below
the normal household requirements for washing, cooking, drinking and other
domestic purposes.
8.   The approved Master Plan for Metropolitan Lagos  2/ gives the popula-
tion of the Metropolis as 4.4 million in 1980; this was projected by the
Plan at a rate of growth of 8.9% per annum to reach 6.8 million in 1985;
9.15 million in 1990 and 15.34 million by the year 2000. The depressed
economic conditions since the preparation of the Master Plan have resulted
in a severe reduction in rate of migration to Lagos, from 9% per year over
the past 30 years, to a little over 4.5% in the next 10 years. The

estimated 1985 population based on population surveys was 6.31 million.
Using this estimate, population growth has been updated as follows:
Year                                1985   1990    1995    2000    2005
Total Population (million)          6.31    7.89    9.90   12.45   15.73
Average Annual Growth Rate (X)       4.5    4.65      4.7     4.8
On the basis of these moderate and revised growth rates, the population of
Metropolitan Lagos is still expected to more than double in the next 20
years. Attachment 2 to this Annex shows the projected copulation for each
Planning Control Unit.
9.        Demand projections for each PCU are also included in Attachment 2
to the year 2005. These have been made on the basis of land use categories
(para 7) as follows and levels of service detailed in Attachment 3:

of the project.
10.       Population and demand projections are shown graphically in
Attachment 4, which also shows the planned expansion of service capacity.
The shortfall between demand and supply is evident in all years.
Capacity and Demand Projections
11.       The project would approximately double the waterworks total
supply capacity by 1990, from 301,550 to 622,000 ms/d (67 to 137 mgd),
through the introduction of a new 318,220 m9/d (70 mgd) works at Adiyan as
shown on see Map IBRD 19776. The capacity of part of the primary networks
would be increased more substantially, by 660,000 m9/d (145 mgd) in
total for 1995 operating conditions. The greater increment in the primary
mains' capacity occurs because LSWC already has the appropriately sized
pipes in stock, as they were purchased several years ago in anticipation of
the project, before Nigeria ran into financial difficulties in 1981
onwards. Furthermore, the capacity is required for two related reasons:
the "indivisibilities" associated with primary mains, and the need to build



- 35 -                    ANNEX 1-2
Page 5 of 6
capacity in anticipation of demand growth and the addition of a second
stage expansion of Adiyan in the mid 1990s (see Attachment 4). The
secondary and tertiary mains would expand more or less in step with
consumption-and, in fact, since consumption is supply constrained, would
determine its rate of growth.
12.       Notwithstanding such large increases of capacity, there would
still be much unserved demand and, apart from the primary mains, all
components of the project are likely to be used at full capacity once the
first phase of tertiary networks is completed in 1995. On completion of
the project, the average volume of water available for household consump-
tion would be about 47 lcd for those with access to public supply, while
5.6 million of Lagos projected 1995 population of 9.9 million would be
consuming less than 50 lcd, 3/ still barely in the 50-100 lcd range noted
above regarding minimal domestic requirements for drinking, cooking,
washing and sanitation. The amount of water available for industrial and
other non-household users would rise to about 127,280 m9/d (28 mgd - twice
the present level), but, again, would be well below actual demand,
accounting for perhaps less than one third of industrial consumption.
13.       Capacity utilization is therefore not an issue for the proposed
project. Rather, the main issue is the opposite: how to increase capacity
further, by about 340,000 ms/d (75 mgd) beyond that provided by the present
project, to meet the huge backlog that will still persist after completion
of the project, and to accommodate yet further increases in demand as the
population and income of 'Lagos grow. The present project thus provides for
a significant increase in capacity, but, more importantly, its tarification
and institutional development aspects are intended to provide a basis for
the long-term growth of the LSWC (see also Annex 1-3 and paras 1.09 et
sequentes).
14.       The following table presents an estimate of supply allocations to
various categories of consumer in 1995 after commissioning of the Adiyan
treatment plant and laying of the primary mains, and the major part of the
additional secondary and tertiary system. The figures are less than the
demand estimates shown projected in Attachment 4 because of the supply
capacity constraints noted above 4/:
3/   People on standpipes would be 2.18 million and unserved 3.48 million.
See Table 1.
4/   A larger project to eliminate those constraints, though desirable
in principle, will not be institutionally or financially feasible
until the present project is well advanced.

15.       The industrial and "special use" gross demands were estimated on
the basis of the following eoefficients: 68 mg ha/day for industry and 18
m3/ha/day for special use.  In the absence of metered consumption data and
historical records, this is an acceptable basis for estimating the demands.
As noted, actual supply availabilities are likely to be considerably below
demand requirements on completion of the project, as they are at present.
16.       In sum, although the project will roughly double the waterworks
supply capacities by about 1990, supply allocations will still fall far
short of projected (and, even, present) demands. Hence continued expansion
of the waterworks is anticipated in the 1990s. The primary networks have
been dimensioned to meet part of such increases, while the secondary and
tertiary networks will grow directly with demand.

LAGOS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LSWC ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. The Organization
1.       LSWC is the executing agency for the project and will be respon-
sible for managing and operating the proposed investment once it is in
place. LSWC was created as the state owned Lagos State Water Management
Board in 1980 under Lagos State Law No. 21. In November 1985 LASG approved
a name change to Lagor State Water Corporation and then confirmed this
change in a new 1986 law which repealed the 1980 law. The new Law reflects
the changes in status, objectives and scope of responsibilities of LSWC.
2.        The functions of LSWC under the new law include, inter alia, the
following:
(a)    To manage all waterworks in the State;
(b)   To extend and develop existing waterworks;
(c)   To establish, manage, control and develop new waterworks
for public, agricultural, industrial and general purposes;
and
(d)   To ensure the supply of adequate and potable water
throughout the State at reasonable charges.
The general powers of the Corporation are very extensive and give it power
"... to do all such acts as appear to it to be requisite, advantageous or
convenient and may carry on any activities in that behalf either alone or
in association with any other persons or body..."  These powers extend to
all activities whether concerning State waters, land, property, finance or
manpower. More particularly, it can" ... do any thing for the purpose of
advancing the skill of persons employed by the Corporation or the
efficiently of the equipment of the Corporation or the manner in which the
equipment is operated, including the provision of facilities for training,
education and research ..."
3.        LSWC reports to Government through the Military Governor's office
to which it is attached. Contract award limits for LSWC and the expen-
diture authorization limits of the General Manager of LSWC were quite low
and would have been unworkable for the proposed project. Both LASG and
LSWC are presently implementing a program for gradually increasing these
limits and the general autonomy of LSWC. (See Attachment 1)

Page 2 of 10
B. Organization Structure
4.        LSWC is headed by the General Manager who oversees the functions
of seven departments: Secretary, Operations, Mechanical/Electrical, Quality
Control, Accounting and Finance, Civil Engineering, and a special
department to manage the proposed Lagos Water Projects. Each department,
except the Secretary's, is headed by a qualified professional and all seven
department heads report directly to the General Manager. A chart of LSWC's
existing organization is shown at Attachment 2. LSWC has a staff of 1,500
of which over 60 have either university or technical qualifications and
training, although there are important vacancies in the operational and
financial cadres.
5.        While senior management meet as a team on a regular basis and are
thus kept informed of developments corporation-wide, no regularly scheduled
section or departmental meetings are held. This is reflected in jtnior
staff's limited knowledge of what is done in departments other than their
own. Job demarcation reinforces the separation of functions and limits
staff understanding of the necessary under-relatedness of their work. This
combined with a highly centralized, though participative, management style
in which the General Manager is involved in virtually every decision and
action, means that the Corporation is not operating efficiently at current
levels of service and will most probably experience tremendous difficulties
in moving to the more decentralized mode of operation being proposed under
this project.
6.        LSWC administers its activities through a central headquarters in
Ijora and eight operating zones based at Ijora and Ilupeju.  Stores
facilities are located at Iju, Ijora, and Ishasi and there are two main
workshops at Iju and Ijora.
C. Reorganization of Functions
7.        Lyonnaise Des Eaux (LDE) are recommending a reorganization of
LSWC, which was slightly modified by LASG, and the structure now being
implemented is shown in Attachment 3. The Corporation is being organized
according to four functional areas: Engineering, Technical, Financial and
Administrative. These four areas would comprise Departments each headed by
an Assistant General Manager, a newly created level of management. The
number of controllers would be increased to nine. The main features of the
new organization are reviewed in the following paragraphs.
Engineering Department
8.        Minimal change is envisaged here from the current arrangement in
which there is a Civil Engineering Department and a Lagos Water Supply
Project Department. The Civil Engineering Department will continue to
prepare plans for future water supply expansion in the State as well as all
hydrological and hydrogeological investigations and activities. The newly
created Project Department will be completely responsible for all procure-
ment, consultancy and contractor supervision, performance reporting of the

IBRD assisted project and for staff participating in the technology
transfer schemes under the project (see also para 22 et sequentes).
Proposed staffing requirements in the Engineering Directorate are outlined
in Attachment 4, along with those for all the other departments for the
next ten years.
TechAical Department
9.        Significant changes are proposed within this Departments in which
the functions of Operations will be divided among several sections:
production, distribution, maintenance and a purchasing and stores section.
While operations and maintenance activities are currently resulting in the
production and distribution of as much water as possible, network
efficiency if unknown, LSWC has insufficient revenues, and operation and
maintenance costs are deemed high compared to results. The proposed
reorganization of these functions is meant to partially address these problems
I/ 1
10.       LDE recommend that the Corporation decentralizes its operations
so that services &re provided in closer proximity to consumers. Decen-
tralization will affect primarily two functions: distribution and
commercial activities 2/ . In order to carry out this decentralization,
LSWC's supply area will be divided ultimately into seven divisions (four
initially) which will be further divided to create 16 zones, each with its
own zonal office.  The zone is in charge of the operation and maintenance
of the tertiary network, all aspects of house connections, as well as
direct customer relations. Suggested vehicles, equipment and staffing
levels for divisional and zonal offices hsve been prepared in the LDE
report. The zonal officer, who should be an executive engineer with
knowledge of customer management, will have overall responsibility for
effective zonal office management of water distribution and customer
management. Division managers, at Senior Executive Engineer level, will be
commissioned by the Controller of Distribution to control and monitor zonal
1/ It should be noted that LDE's recommendations in this area pertain to
LSWC organizational structure only, in particular, the regrouping of
certain functions. It will still be necessary for LSWC to develop
guidelines and procedures for preventive maintenance, etc. Technical
assistance to the Technical Directorate will work with LSWC to develop
such guidelines.
2/  For the time being, production activities will remain decentralized at
the waterworks level as they are now. The reasoning behind this is
that combining production and distribution activities would introduce
disparities of size, staff and responsibility among the various zones
and the two functions can be carried out more effectively at this time
by remaining separate.

office activity as well as having specific responsibilities for primary
mains, leak detection, water quality, zonal personnel management and
operation of night and weekend emergency units. There will be progressive
expansion of the Divisional Manager's duties and responsibilities over time
such as accounting and perhaps production.
11.       Although the sites and schedule for opening of Division and Zonal
offices is presented in the LDE report, given the current modus operandi of
LSWC (para 4 above), it will be essential that appropriate administrative
procedures be de-veloped for activities within zonal offices and between
them and divisional headquarters. The proposed Project Implementation and
Review Workshops (see para 2.11 in text) can help staff sort out their
respective roles and responsibilities, but considerable attention must be
given to developing and installing systematic procedures regarding
information collection and distribution, reporting requirements, informa-
tion flows and mechanisms, as well as forms to be used. All of this
represents new activity for the Corporation and will require considerable
thought and effort. Technical assistance staff to the technical, adminis-
trative and financial directorates will have, as part of their TOR,
responsibility for developing such administrative procedures in collab-
oration with LSWC staff.
12.       Maintenance activities will be regrouped and rationalized in a
central location to be called the Technical Center to be placed at Ilupeju.
Preventive maintenance activities would become the responsibility of
operators at both production as well as distribution sites. The Technical
Center will be the location for most maintainance staff and will include
the following:
(i) Central workshops, under the management of the Maintenance
Controller:
- Mechanical
- Electrical
- Car/Vehicle and Mobile Plant
- Meter repair, carpentry, buildings
- Borehole Maintenance
(ii) Central warehouses and stores, under the management of the
Purchasing and Stores Manager:
- To supply equipment and materials to contractors and direct
construction units
- To supply zonal offices and production unit stores
13.       Stores would be located at three categories of sites:
a central store at the Technical Center, zonal stores and waterworks
stores. The Purchasing and Stores Manager will ensure that operating
departments within his own, as well as other directorates, receive
materials and equipment in a timely fashion.

Financial Department
14.       Considerable expansion of activities is envisaged in the area of
accounting and finance. The changes will focus primarily in the areas of
accounting procedures and commercial activities/orientation. The finance
department will comprise two sections: (i) Accounting and Finance
(eventually to be split into two departments) and (ii) commercial
(initially including data processing which would eventually become a
separate unit).
'15.      Good financial management and accounting systems are essential to
the success of LSWC. It presently operates a basic receipts and payments
system inherited from government and has audited annual accounts available
up to FY85. They have been reviewed by thc Bank and found satisfactory.
The State Director of Audit and the independent auditor expect to have the
FY86 and FY87 accounts of LSWC audited by end April 1988. During project
implementation, LSWC will institute an accrual system based on commercial
accounting principles. Accordingly, the following are being developed and
implemented:
(a) An appropriate accounting system, including details of an
implementation timetable and staffing requirements (number and
skills);
(b) An accounting manual, including detailed description of systems,
flow charts and specimen forms (already drafted by LDE);
(c) An accounting coding system;
(d) A commercial development plan including enumeration of existing
customers, service connection policy and strategy, metering
programme, use of data processing through a Computer Bureau and
its own inhouse system. Discussion of this plan is scheduled for
negotiations; and
(e) Financial regulations specifying appropriate cost authorization
levels and procedures for staff from zone managers to Directors
and for the LSWC Board.
16.       As part of the LDE study, all assets of LSWC have been
identified, catalogued and valued to end 1985 replacement costs. Notional
depreciation has been calculated based on agreed asset lives. The new
values have been brought into LSWC's FY86 accounts. LSWC has obtained a
quotation from LDE for a computer system based on the IBM PCs, of which the
Corporation presently has four, so that it can operate a proprietary
accounting package in FY88. In the meanwhile, the new Financial Controller
has developed a manual accounting system with rudimentary accruals which
was implemented in FY86 and 87 and will be completed in FY88.

Page 6 of 10
17.       LSWC meets about 35% of its cash operating costs from its own
revenues, with the balance being made up by subvention from LASG. The
Corporation is statutorily required to meet all its recurrent expenditures
from water revenues and other charges. The Corporation would like to meet
all operating costs plus depreciation or debt service, whichever is
greater, and make a contribution to its own capital expenditure program out
of its revenues.
18.       A heavy emphasis will therefore be given during project implemen-
tation to cost recovery and proper tariff structures as well as metering.
LASG most recently indicated support for cost recovery by approving a
tariff schedule on 12th February 1986. This schedule is reproduced at
Annex 1-4. LSWC intends to apply for tariff increases annually,
simultaneous with its budget submission to LASG, to reach its target by
1991 of revenue meeting cash operating costs. LSWC expects to achieve its
overall financial objectives by meeting its combined cash operating
expenses plus depreciation or debt service, whichever is the higher, in
FY96.
Secretarial/Legal Department
19.       This Department would be divided into two departments: (i)
Administration and (ii) Personnel and Training. The Administration Depart-
ment will carry out similar activities to its current ones, that is public
relations, legal, corporate secretariat and general services. The
Personnel function will include responsibility for personnel planning,
employee relations, employment, employee services, working conditions,
wages and salaries and performance appraisals as well manpower development
and training.
20.       Manpower development and training will have a central role in
LSWC's activities for the foreseeable future. The current availability of
suitably qualified and trained staff within the Corporation is uneven; the
staffing profile, r -ticularly the ratio of professional to non-
professional staf'   s unbalanced (too few professionals).  The total
number of staff in LSWC is expected to increase from 1526 in 1985 to 3113
in 1996 and is indicated a Departmental basis in Attachment 3. Given the
current staff profile, the projected addition of about 300 staff per year
to the Corporation over the next ten years, as indicated in
Attachment 5, and the introduction of significant changes to activities
currently carried out by LSWC (such as data processing and the whole range
of commercial activities), staff training at virtually all grade levels
will need to be designed and implemented. Annex 2-2 contains a more
detailed outline of training proposed under the project.
21.       The Corporation is currently operating on the basis of state
regulations used by the civil service. LDE has provided a general frame-
work of a Personnel Policy for LSWC, which will need to be expanded and
developed more fully to meet the specific needs of the Corporation. LDE is
also putting forth recommendations on how LSWC might Improve conditions of
service, allowances and benefits so as to provide a competitive package to



- 47-                    ANNEX 1-3
Page 7 of 10
prospective employees.  LDE proposes that appointments of lower level staff
(GLO1 to GL06) are at the prerogative of the management committee of the
Corporation 3/ . LDE further recommends that only appointments to GLO8
and above involve the Appointment Committee composed of LSWC Directors and
representatives of the State Government. This system is being proposed so
that recruitment and hiring can proceed more efficiently, which will be
essential given the large numbers of staff to be recruited over the next 10
years.
22.       As indicated in para 8 the Corporation has set up a separate
department which will function as the project unit to implement the
proposed project. The Corporation has received approval in its 1986 budget
submission to place 35 staff in the project unit, including eight
university qualified engineers, six sub-professionals, and support staff.
As at appraisal, four professionals were working full-time in the Project
Department.
23.       It is the Corporation's intention to second staff currently
working with LSWC to the Project Department and recruit new staff to fill
their positions. It is also expected that the project unit will continue
to need to expand as project implementation takes off. LSWC will need LASG
approval of its requests for budget to recruit additional staff and there-
fore must keep LASG apprised of the growth requirements. In addition, LSWC
must plan for the recruitment, orientation and bringing on board of a
significant number of new staff who will be filling slots from clerical to
professional. The Corporation expects expansion of the system to continue
beyond the proposed project and that they will need the services of any new
staff recruited under this project for the foreseable future. The
Corporation will need to review its staffing levels and needs on a regular
basis as the project is implemented and as the system is commissioned.
24.       The Corporation intends that staff assigned to the project remain
the responsibility of their department of origin for "professional support"
but devote 100% of their time to the project. This duality of responsi-
bilities is another instance of new concepts to be absorbed by some of
LSWC's staff.
25.       It is the intention of the Corporation that knowledge transfer be
part of the program of project engineers working together with outside
consultants and contractors on the Adiyan treatment plant, the SOBEA
primary mains contract and the secondary and tertiary mains contracts.
LSWC was encouraged to be as specific as possible in identifying training
needs and specifying outcomes, and also to supervise the training
activities as rigorously as it supervises physical works. The previous
3/ Under current hiring procedures, staff of all grade levels must be
approved by the Appointment Committee, which also interviews every
candidate.

Project Controller recently attended a 2-1/2 month course on project
management financed by the PPF indicated an interest in the possibility of
secouding project staff for brief periods to other water corporations which
have done similar work successfully.
E. Technical Assistance
26.       In order to implement the project and operate the system once it
is in place, LSWC staff will need to do their jobs more efficiently and
effectively than at present and some functious will need to be introduced
into the Corporation that are not currently done, such as data processing
and training. The Corporation has agreed that technical aesistance will be
required in all four functional areas if they are to achie-ve their goals.
The levels of technical assistance to be provided in each area are set out
in Annex 2-1 and the Implementation Schedule in Annex 2-4. Draft terms of
reference are available for all proposed technical assistance personnel.
27.       A Project Adviser will be assigned to the Engineering Directorate
for a period of 24 man-months. This person will primarily work with the
Project Controller and staff, but will be available also to the Engineering
Department. The Project Controller has identified the need for assistance
in contract supervision, review of designs, procurement as well as advice
on organizing and managing Project Department staff, especially as the
Department experiences rapid growth. In addition, 6 man-months of
specialist advice on procurement logistics will be sought. Finally, 12
man-months of assistance will be provided for, but not allocated at this
time, in order to allow needs that may arise during the course of implemen-
tation.
28.       A total of 42 man-months of assistance is planned for the
Technical Department - 36 for a senior advisor and 6 for a cost estimator.
The senior advisor would be available to assist in all four sections of
this Department: Production, distribution, maintenance and purchasing and
stores. One of the primary responsibilities for this person will be to
develop with LSWC staff, operations and maintenance procedures for
production and distribution. A cost estimator was requested by the Corpo-
ration to work with them in pricing work at the new Technical Centre as
well as advising on when and whether to carry out repairs in house versus
use of the private sector.
29.       Considerable technical assistance will be necessary in the
Finance Department, especially for the Commercial Sections wherein the
Corporation currently has no capability. Thus there is provision for a
D.P. Advisor (12 man-months), Systems Analysts (36 man-months), Information
Systems Specialist (12 man-months) and a Programmer (24 man-months). Is
addition, 108 man-months of technical assistance will be provided by
Nigerian Programmers.
30.       For support to the Accounting Section, a Costing Systems Adviser
will be required for 12 man-months to develop a Costing Manual and work
with the controller to implement the costing system. Also, a General



- 49 -                   ANNEX 1-3
Page 9 of 10
Accounting Adviser will be provided for 12 man-months to develop a Manage-
ment Reporting Manual, a Loan Management Manual and provide other
accounting advice.
31.       The Corporation intends to recruit a high-level well-qualified
professional as Secretary and Legal Advisor. LSWC currently has no
trainers or training program and no personnel policy, procedures, or
management. Therefore, 12 man-months of a Personnel Advisor would be
required to develop and implement personnel policy and procedures to follow
on the analytical work of LDE. One Training Advisor is necessary to work
with the Director of Administration and the Training Manager for 18 months
to establish a training unit, identify training priorities and help
identify specialists to develop the various training courses. Forty-two
man-months is allocated for short-term training specialist who would be
recruited to design individual courses. Additionally the Corporation would
have 48 man- months available for appropriate support in establishing its
decentrali-
sation policies in the proposed Division and Zones.
Method of Delivery
32.       LSWC has expressed interest in entering into a twinning arrange-
ment with another water utility for provision of T.A., particularly in the
areas of operations and maintenance (Technical Department), training and
personnel (Admin. Directorate), and commercial and accounting (Finance
Department). The Project Advisor and Procurement Logistics Expert could be
drawn from elsewhere depending on background and qualifications. In a
project of this size and scope, and given the difficulty LSWC staff have in
projecting their needs (particularly in areas where they have no previous
experience), a twinning arrangement would provide the flexibility to
respond fairly quickly to additional needs which may well be identified by
LSWC staff once they attempt to implement the project. For this reason an
additional 48 man-months has been allocated for experts to be mobilised as
necessary to assist LSWC with implementation of the new decentralised
organization structure irn the Divisions and Zones.
Implementation Planning and Review Workshops
33.       While senior management of LSWC are hardworking, dedicated and
have a solid base of professional technical skills, they have not received
any training in the area of management. Apart from specialist overseas
training for some of the senior staff, management training modules are
proposed for all supervisory staff under the training program. These
courses will be brief and have a practical orientation towards the local
environment. Additionally, and in order to assist LSWC Management to do
detailed planning for the implementation of this project and reinforce
their practical management skills, a series of semi-annual implamentation
planning and review workshops will be held.
34.       The objectives of these workshops will be (i) for LSWC staff to
translate the broad implementation strategy outlined by LDE into a program
of action for each of them tied to their timetable for the next six months



- 50 -                    ANNEX 1-3
Page 10 of 10
and (ii) introduce a method which staff can use within their departments
and sections to develop work programs. Initially, the workshops will be
designed to be run by expatriate facilitators. The expatriate staff would
train a Nigerian (preferably an LSWC staff member so as to develop in-house
capability), so that by year 3, no further outside assistaiuce would be
necessary. The first of these workshops is proposed to be held early 1988,
so that LSWC can plan to implement those tasks which can be achieved prior
to project effectiveness. At an appropriate date between the project's
approval and before the date of effectiveness, a Project Launch Workshop
(PLW), would be held. The PLW, a structured project start-up activity,
will bring together the key staff members of the LSWC and coordinating
ministries to review the project objectives and procedures and to discuss
in detail the sequence of implementation activities. Thereafter,
Implementation Planning and Review Workshops would be held every six months
to review the progress of implementation during the previous six months and
discuss and plan in detail the coming six m,-ths' activities. It is
envisaged that World Bank supervision missions would coincide with these
workshops.
P. Corporation Performance
35.       Top i ,nagement of LSWC is dedicated to making the Corporation an
effective and viable institution. LSWC is not operating at top efficiency
at current levels of service, and new or improved administrative and
management procedures need to be implemented in all functions.  While top
management is motivated, indications are that staff below management are
not yet "part of the team". Management procedures and style inherited from
Government tend to emphasize negative more than positive incentives - the
new personnel policies will help to develop LSWC's own Corporate culture.
Given the magnitude of the organizational changes the Corporation will need
to make over the next few years, it will. be essential that staff are
informed of what is happening and made to feel an important part of it.
This will be an important theme throughout the approach to training and
development of LSWC and its staff.

LAGOS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A. LSWC - Income Statement
Water Produced/Sold
1.        Until 1985 information on water produced was scarce, it is only
in that year that LSWC started improvements of record keeping. Results
indicate the following principal factors: Maximum production on a capacity
of 127.6 Nm3/y was 86.0 Mms/y or about 67%; of that 30X was unaccounted
for, thus leaving a production of some 60.2 Nm9/y. Given that consumers
are not presently accustomed to paying for water, billed sales in 1985 of
only 6.0 Mm9/y or about 10% were correspondingly low and were mostly the
result of negotiated flat-rate charges. For projections purposes
therefore, these factors have been allowed to improve very slowly with
unaccounted-for water remaining at 30% through 1991 and thereafter
gradually declining to 25% by 1996. Maximum percent production vs
installed capacity is gradually increasing from about 67% to 85% in 1993
and maintained at that level, thereafter. Conversely, as LSWC's capacity
of billing and collecting sales revenues is the cornerstone of the
project's success in financial terms, the percentage of water
billed/consumed has been projected to raise to reach 45% by 1990 and 95% by
1996. This is deemed feasible with the help of the computerized billing
system and some technical assistance.
Average Revenue per a3
2.        Although rates are forecast to rise substantially, the major
increase in revenue over the next years will clearly result from more
intensive metering and improved billing and collection. The financial
analysis shows that, to eliminate operating subventions by 1991, service
debt, and meet operating costs, the average tariff would have to rise from
the 1988 level of US$0.41 per m9, to about US$0.76 per m3 by 1996.
3.        Changes in prices, costs, wages and in the foreign exchange
component of debt service with any changes in the exchange rate, will
necessarily require LSWC to revise tariffs periodically if cost-reflecting
levels are to be achieved. The appraisal mission discussed the timing of
the adjustments with LSWC and LASG and agreed that adjustments to tariffs
as and when necessary would be incorporated in the annual budget
preparation exercises of LSWC and LASG. To give the tariff settings a
concrete objective, the aim would be to generate an operating surplus
(after debt servicing or depreciation whichever is the higher) by 1995.

Inflation
4.        The following inf'ation factors have been used in LSWC's
financial forecasts for foreign and local costs:
Fiscal Year                 88    89    90    91    92    93    94    95
Foreign                     1.0   1.0   1.0   3.5   3.5   3.5   3.5   3.5
Local                      20    15    10    10    10    10    10    10
Certain categories of expenditure which are fully foreign cost related
(such as chemicals and debt servicing) have been converted at the rate of
Ml - US$0.23.
Other Revenues
5.        Other revenues consist essentially of connection fees.  The 1988
average unit price of N 400 has been reduced in 1990 by 50S owing to
expected economies of scale as the number of connections increases from
annually 3,500 in 1988 to about 22.,000 in 1996. Provisions for bad debts
of 452 in 1986 are allowed to gradually decrease to 5% in 1996.
Expenses
6.   (a)  Personnel, electricity, chemicals and vehicle repair costs have
been developed annually in line with production and sales growth.
Maintenance is projected at 2/3 of 1% of the value of gross fixed assets ln
operation.
(b) Expenditures for administration and projects as well as for data
processing have been developed in line with the number of connections and
sales growth.
(c) Depreciation of fixed assets is projected at an average of 3.51.
Fixed assets in operation before 1986 were estimated on the basis of a
detailed identification and evaluation carried out by LDE during late 1985
and brought into LSWC's accounts in FY86. In FY87, LSWC revalued the
assets based on new exchange rates. Fixed assets have been revalued
annually by a weighted average of domestic and international inflation
factors and depreciation calculated on the new fixed asset values.
(d) Interest charges on borrowings were calculated by assuming:
(i)  The Bank loan would be US$173.2 million on standard terms
(20 years including 5 years grace, 7.72% interest) and the
EIB loan of US$47.4 million over 18 years, including a
5-year grace period, at 5X annual interest; and
(ii) The French COFACE guaranteed commercial bank loans of
US$164.8 million are expected to be at 8.75% over 11 years
with 3 years grace period.

B. LSWC - Balance Sheet and Funds Flow Statements
Balance Sheet
7.        Fixed assets were appraised and valued at 1985 prices by LDE;
their net value has been treated as capitalized grants by Government. The
revaluation surplus created by the revaluation of assets by LSWC in FY87,
due to realignment of the currencly, is treated at separate equity of LSWC.
Apart from this build-up of corporate equity begins as all investment
funds, including the project, are passed on to LSWC at about a ratio of
84/16 as long-term debt/equity. This ratio is dictated by LWSC's initial
inability to generate excess revenues to participate in project financing.
It is only during FY96 and thereafter that it would be able to generate
sufficient earnings for that purpose. It is assumed therefore that LSWC
will participate with a substantial share in financing of the second phase
of its investment plan. Accounts receivable represent an estimated 3
months of outstanding Ind/Com/Domestic direct billings. Stocks also
represent a 3 months supply of chemicals, spare parts and connection
matertals throughout the project.
Funds Flow Statement
8.        Borrowings represent the total of Bank, French Commercial Banks
and EIB loans of US$385.4 million. The French loans will be disbursed at a
faster pace than the EIB and IBRD loans. The Bank loan is projected to be
disbursed over a period of 8 years in accordance with the regional profile
for water supply projects, but slightly quicker in the early years, while
the RIB loan is expected to be disbursed over 4 years. For purposes of
financing the second phase (expected to begin by 1993), it has been assumed
that Bank participation would be about at the same proportion as for the
presently proposed project. Grants by CIDA (US$3.2 million) and UNDP
(US$0.55 million) would be passed on to LSWC as Government equity.

LAGOS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
MANPOWER AND TRAINING
A. Existing Situation
1.        The management and implementation of the proposed Bank-financed
project will impose substantial demands upon the institutional capacity and
performance of Lagos State Water Corporation. New and improved systems
covering all aspects of the Corporation's statutory and operational
functions will be introduced. A principal determinant of the rate at which
LSWC will be able to assimilate the proposed institutional changes will be
the availability and retention of appropriately trained manpower. The
current availability of suitably qualified and trained staff is uneven; the
staffing profile, particularly the ratio of professional to
non-professional staff, is unbalanced, as is the distribution of staff
among waterworks installations and zonal offices. The workforce of about
1,500 staff, comprises an excessive number of employment categories and job
titles. This has led to poor labor utilization, job demarcation, and the
dilution of supervisory responsibilities. There is considerable scope for
productivity improvement in all departments.
2.        On the basis of its current manpower strength and scope of work,
LSWC needs to be supported by a strong training function. Implementing the
proposed project will increase this need substantially.
3.        Currently, LSWC makes no provision for organized in-house staff
training and lacks the experience and capacit7' to rectify this deficiency.
A few higher-level staff attend local courses jf education and training
each year, but these are seldom sector-, or job-related. The 1985 training
budget allocated N16,000 to training, of which about N10,000 (622) was
committed. Measured against the Corporation's existing training needs this
investment in human resources development was much too low. A more
realistic annual investment would be about two percent (N112,000) of
payroll costs.
4.        LSWC recognizes the inadequacy of existing training arrangements
and would begin to develop, as a component of the proposed project, a
comprehensive scheme of education and training covering all staffing levels
and categories. The LDE report has laid the foundation for an early start
to be made in implementation of the training component.
B. Context
5.        The training component has been designed within the broad
institutional development context of the project. In this sense it relates
to, and supports, priority manpower and training needs arising from:



-76-                       ANNEX 2-2
Page 2 of 3
(a) institutional reform and organization restructuring;
(b) new systems for personnel, financial, commercial, technical,
and operational services;
(c) the need to upgrade the skills of existing staff; provide
basic skills for new staff; and develop a sense of corporate
identity throughout LSWC; and
(d) the introduction of specialized central support services
(e.g., leak detection).
C. Training Objectives
6.        The broad objective of the training component would be to assist
LSWC to develop the first phase of a permanent human resources development
program. Specific objectives would be to:
(a) establish a specialist cadre of full-time training staff and
instructors;
(b) provide orientation training for all LSWC staff;
(c) develop modular in-house programs covering basic, refresher,
supervisory, and management training for key staff cadres;
(d) develop management and functional skills of senior staff
through a program of external study tours, attachments and
secondments to established water supply agencies, or to a
"twinning" agency; and
(e) formulate long-term staff development programs to support
the "Schemes of Service" to be introduced during project
implementation for staff cadres in the board functions of
administration, financial, technical, and engineering
services.
D. Scope
7.        Major elements and start up activities of the training component
are shown in the timetable at Attachment 1 and would comprise:
(a) establishing a Training Steering Committee and a permanent
cadre of about 14 training staff;
(b) creating simple training facilities at LSWC headquarters
(off-the-job), and in three divisional areas (on-the-job);
(c) providing orientation training for all staff;
(d) developing a panel of LSWC part-time training staff;



- 77 -                       ANNEX 2-2
Page 3 of 3
(e) preparing and delivering basic, specialized, and refresher
training programs to support the training requirements of
new "Schemes of Service" for staff cadres;
(f) implementing a local and overseas training program
emphasizing practical management and operational skills; and
(g) a training evaluation mechanism.
E. Training Demand
8.        The estimated annual in-house training demand would rise to about
800 staff weeks in Year Three of training implementation. Initially
priority would be given to a deliberate and sustained program of
orientation training for both existing and new staff. This would be
followed by a program for all management and supervisory staff covering
LSWC manpower and training policy, planning, and their training
responsibilities for subordinate staff. The introduction of basic and
refresher training programs would begin midway through Year Two. Full
training capacity would be developed by the start of Year Three of training
Implementation. The refresher training program would aim to cover twenty
percent of the workforce annually.
9.        The staffing plan of LSWC and the associated turnover/employment
prospects to 1995 are shown in Attachments 3 and 4 respectively to Annex
1-3. These lead to an estimated training demand in terms of principal
target audiences by category and number as datailed in Attachment 2 hereto.
F. Implementation
10.       It has been discussed and agreed with LSWC that about 60
man-months of expert services would be required to support training
implementation. Technical assistance for training will comprise one
long-term training adviser (18 man-months), and a multi-disciplinary team
of short-term training specialists (42 man-months). Training
responsibilities would be specified in the terms of reference of each
member of the technical assistance team and would be implemented under the
overall coordination of the Training Adviser, in conjunction with the LSWC
Training Manager, acting as his counterpart.
11.       The selection and training of the LSWC Training Manager and two
training development officers would be completed, if possible, before the
start of the technical assistance program. This would ensure the timely
start of the training implementation plan.
G. Cost
12.       The total cost (less contingencies) of the training component is
estiumted to be US$1.5 million of which about US$1.2 million would be
foreign costs to be financed under the proposed loan (Attachment 3).
Annual recurrent training costs would be about N126,000, based upon an
in-house training program of 30 operating weeks per year. LSWC agreed
during negotiations to 2Z of annual personnel costs to be applied to meet
recurrent costs of training.

LAGOS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
PROCUREMENT METHODS AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Procurement
1.        All contracts with a value of US$500,000 or above for the supply
and erection of plant and the supply of material will be awarded through
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines.
Contracts below US$500,000, or equivalent, for plant, equipment and
material and US$3,000,000, or equivalent, for civil works will be let on
the basis of competitive bidding, advertized locally, in accordance with
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. Contracts for the treatment works at
Adiyan and the primary mains had already been awarded by a process of
selective tendering prior to the Bank being invited to participate in the
financing of the project. Bank and EIB financing is for the remaining
components of the project. Domestically manufactured goods would be
allowed 15X preference or the applicable import duty, whichever is lower,
for the purposes of bid evaluation. Bidding documents will require that
all companies employ some Nigerian staff in order to promote the transfer
of skills and technology from expert staff to Nigerian staff.
2.        Arrangements *- r the procurement of goods and services under this
project are shown in the following table with the categories proposed for
Bank financing shown on the lower line:

a/ Turnkey contracts for Adiyan Treatment plant and primary mains.
3.   Nigerian Law requires that foreign contractors operating in Nigeria be
incorporated in the country with local ownership of 60%. Many large
foreign contractors are already established on this basis in Nigeria and
will be strong competitors for contracts under the project. However, the
magnitude of some of the contracts to be let is likely to attract
additional foreign competition. During negotiations of the Fifth Power
Project (Loan 1766-UNI) in 1979 assurances were given that foreign
companies executing Bank-assisted projects would not be affected by the
federal guidelines requiring incorporation within a year of their arrival
in Nigeria and in fact, foreign companies working on the Bank-assisted
water supply project in Kaduna have been granted exemption from this law.
Such exemptions will be sought for this project. Federal Government
regulations also require that all goods to be imported into Nigeria should
be inspected at the port of embarkation by an approved inspection agency.
The quality and quantity of the goods are to be certified prior to shipment
to Nigeria.

4.   Disbursements would be made on the basis of statements of expenditures
(SOEs) for the following items: (a) civil works contracts of less than
US$100,000 equivalent; (b- equipment and materials contracts of less than
US$20,000 equivalent; (c) consultant and technical assistance contracts of
less than US$20,000 equivalent; (d) costs of training programs, and (e)
force account civil works. Documents related to these items would be
retained by LSWC and made available upon request for review by visiting
Bank missions. Auditing of the proceeds of the loan, including SOEs and
the Special Account, would be carried out by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank as part of the annual audit of LSWC's financial
statements.
B. Financing
5.   Financing of the proposed project and its individual components are
shown in the Attachment to this Annex.
The proposed IBRD loan of US$173.2 million would cover 80% of total costs
of Civil Works and up to 100 percent of the total costs of other items
(Annex 2-1) to be financed by the Bank. In addition, the Bank would
finance approximately US$5.1 million equivalent of local costs. The French
Commercial Banks' loans would cover 85% of the foreign exchange costs of
the proposed waterworks at Adiyan and of laying the 65.5 km of primary
transmission mains. The European Investment Bank loan would cover the cost
of supply of primary, secondary and tertiary mains for PCUs numbered 1,2
2A, 3 and 5 and rehabilitation of the anti-salinity weir on the Iju river.
The CIDA grant will finance foreign exchange costs of consulting services
for detailed design of the secondary and tertiary distribution network
while the UNDP grant finances consulting services provided by a French
water utility (LDE) for the Organization and Management Study. Lagos State
Government would provide the balance (US$43.6 million) of local cost
financing including that required to meet possible cost overruns in
addition to 15% of the foreign exchange costs for the Adiyan waterworks
and the laying of the primary mains.

2.   LASG's contributions would be pzid into a project account maintained
and operated by LSWC. The account has already been opened and has been in
operation since late 1984 to meet counterpart funds on project preparation
activities. Estimates of the annual amounts required are shown below:
Lagos State Government Contributions
1988   1989   1990   1991   1992   1993   1994
----    -H-WS$ millions)- --- --
Annual                      39.1   10.0    7.5    7.5    6.7    1.8      -
Cumulative                  39.1   49.1   56.6   64.1   70.8   72.6   72.6
LSWC would revise and update these estimates annually and advise LASG
accordingly. Payments to the- project account would be made on a quarterly
basis in advance of the quarter in which the funds would be required.
3.   The estimated schedule of disbursements for the IBRD loan is shown in
the Attachment to this Annex. The schedule is based on the average
disbursement profile for water supply projects in West Africa which is
applicable to this project. The closing date of the loan would be
March 31, 1996 with project completion expected by September 30, 1995.

Introduction
1.       The econaoMi  analysis is in four parts, dealing with (i) total
and incremental supply conts; (ii) tariffs, from the various viewpoints
of finance, economic efficiency and affordability; (iii) the economic
returns; and (tv) risks.

2.        The financial and economic costs of the project (in 1987 US
dollar border prices, usiug N4.0'US$1.0) are as follows:

support, costing 3 74.4a.

costs*
c/ One-half of lnvestment in primary mains under contract 4 subtracted

3.        Oporation and maintenance costs (in border prices) amount to N
49.0 milUlon pr yewar, taking 06& to be 7.5Z of base costs for the water
works, 1.52 for pipes, and including incremental costs of Nl.0 million

per year for billing and revenue collection. These average out to about
4% of capital costs excluding institutional support.
4.        With the water works producing at 85% of rated capacity
(allowing for maintenance and unplanned outages) and assuming physical
losses of 25%, the average incremental costs at a 12% discount rate are
about N 1.9 per cubic meter produced in border prices, or N 2.0 per
cubic meter in domestic prices.
5.        The long-run marginal costs of supply, however, are
appreciably below this level, say around N 1.3 to 1.5 per cubic meter.
The inclusion of rehabilitation investments in the present project has
lowered the incremental costs somewhat, but, overall, they remain higher
than the LRMC. The main reasons for this are:
(a) only minor extensions (20-30 km) of the primary mains would be
needed to extend supplies substantially (see network diagram).
The same applies, though to a lesser degree, to the secondary
networks;
(b) the incremental costs of Adiyan stage II would be less than
those for stage I because the access infrastructure and works,
and some site preparation costs, will have been met by the
present project; and
(c) the network expansion costs of the present project are
unusually large because of the 20 year backlog in investment
and the growth of the population over this period.
Tariffs
6.        Background.  Before January 1986, there were no direct
consumer tariffs in effect, and LSWC was entirely dependent on
subventions from LASG and negotiated revenues from the government
authorities. These financial transfers amounted to perhaps less than
one-third of the revenues needed if the Corporation (previously the
LSWB) was to finance its operational and maintenance activities and to
expand the water works and distribution systems; it is this deficit,
perhaps more than any other factor, which explains the recent 25 year
backlog in the development of the primary mains networks, and the 15-20
year backlog of investments in water works and in the secondary and
terriary mains (as discussed in Annex 1-2, the slightly lower backlog in
water production and secondary and tertiary distribution, is due to
investments in mini-watervorks). For this reason, the achievement of a
tariff to meet financial requirements and reflect supply costs is
central to the success - and is a major objective - of the project.
There are, in addition, two other reasons for the establishment of a
cost reflecting tariff policy, and which have assumed greater importance
in recent years, namely the elimination of the unnecessary dependence of
water supply on the public revenue, and the reduction of the waste of
water.

ANNEX 2-8
Page 3 of 8
7.        The fiaancial analysis points to a tariff of about US$0.54
(N2.16) (constant 1987 prices) by 1996. This tariff exceeds that
required to meet long-run marginal costs (see para 5 above); in terms of
affordability it compares favorably with current actual household
expenditures on water (see paras 16 to 18 below). Therefore tariff
increases to meet financial performance criteria will be the objective
of tariff policy.
8.        Implementing Strategy.  The immediate objective is to move
towards tariffs that meet financial requirements, with a substantial
increase of 2702 in 1988. This strategy is acceptable to LASG given the
virtual absence of nominal tariff applicatinn before 1988. The
objective on completion of the project would be to arrive at a tariff
level and structure that reflects the opportunity costs of supply,
affordability and financial objectives.   Given that LSWC were starting
from a situation in which no metering, billing or revenue collection
system was in place whatsoever, much of the project preparation period
was devoted to defining tariff policies and developing such a system.
9.        The main elements of the policy that emerged, and agreed to by
LSWC and LASG as a condition of the Bank's appraising the project, were
as follows:
(a) a flat rate base would first be introduced, because few
consumers are presently metered;
(b) the aim would be to win political acceptability of the policy
by making the tariffs comparable to those already in effect in
other states by introducing an average tariff of N 0.45 per
cubic meter.
(c) meters would be installed on all new industrial and the larger
new household customers (where the costs of the meters could
be justified in terms of the savings in consumption);
(d) a connection charge, averaging about N 300 would also be
introduced for all new connections;
(e) meters would also be installed for approximately 10,000
existing industrial and commercial consumers and 55,000
domestic consumers - since this would yield significant
financial returns;
(f) new area offices and revenue collection centers would be
established, and a staff training program begun;
(g) the billing would be quarterly, given staff constraints (and
also the need for meter readers to deliver the bills, given
the unreliability of the postal services);



- 95 -
ANNEX 2-8
Page- 4 of 8
(h) there would be a gradual shift to a tariff that would meet
financial requirements, and provisions for increases due to
changes in costs over time would be incorporated into the
policy. Lastly,
(i) an eventual shift to an economically cost-reflecting tariff
would be sought once (h) had been achieved.
10.       At the time of appraisal, items (a) to (h) of the above policy
were in place and, as a condition of appraisal, had b6en agreed to by
the Lagos State Secretariat. The installation of meters and the
initiation of the billing and collection system, in anticipation of the
policy, was begun on January 1, 1986.
1I.       Annex 1-4 provides a schedule of the tariffs agreed upon for
the first year. The required increases to meet financial requirements
would be sought during the normal btldgetary and planning processes of
LASG.
12.       Affordability of the Tariffs.  The results of the social
survey noted in Annex 1-2, and the projected water allocations in the
following table shows the estimated expenditures of the various income
groups on public water supplies, assuming the N 1.08 per cubic meter
tariff, discussed in para 7 above; the top 5% income group are not
included in the table:

100 lcd ("assessed" because only about the top 5 or 10% are likely
to have metered house connections).
13.       For the lowest income families, the expenditures would likely
be in the range 6 to 7S of family income per month. This compares
favorably with the amount families currently spend on water - unless

they are among that third of families with access to public supplies
currently provided free of charge. Ths social survey found thet
expenditures averaged over 6% of monthly income for families using
private supplies; for the low income groups, the expenditures exceeded
7%, excluding the costs of their own labor in fetching water not
provided by vendors. (See "Domestic Water Use and Sanitation Practices
in Lagos, Nigeria, 1985" in the project files for more details, and also
para 18 et seq. below, on willingness-to-pay).
14.       In sum, the tariffs proposed would be in the interests of
putting LSWC on a sound financial footing, and enable it to carry out
its functions of supplying water to Lagos; it would be economically
efficient, erring if anything on the low side; it wouid eliminate the
present, huge and needless burdens of subventions for water supplies on
the Lagos State Governmeuts' hudget; it would provide for much needed
expansion of the water supply system after the present project is
completed; it would reflect the reality of the foreign exchange scarcity
Xigeria now faces; it would be affordable to all income groups and in
fact reduce water supply costs to many households currently without
access to public supply; and it would be much preferred by the people of
Lagos to having increasingly limited access to public supplies at no
charge.
Economic Returns
15.       The economic returns are based on (i) incremental revenues
from water sales, plus (ii) what are commonly referred to as the
consumer's surplus benefits. Incremental revenues arise from added
production capacity, improved billing and the system deterioration
without the project. Consumers' surpluses arise from the differences
between the costs of public and private supplies, and are intended to
reflect the general benefits to consumers of having an increased volume
of lower cost supplies.
16.       The revenue calculations for (i) are straightforward.  To
estimate the benefits under (ii), the social survey discussed above
inquired as to the costs of private supplies, with the following
results:

a/   Applies to 515 households who did not have direct access to public
supplies.
b/  Assumes 12.5 per day for labor costs (c.f. the 1986 wage rate of 15
per day for unskilled labor) and low income household spending 3
hours per week, the average household 1.3 hours, carrying water
(see paragraph 28).
17.       The reason why average expenditures per cubic meter are much
less than the costs of water supplies from vendors and tankers is that
the latter provide higbhr quality supplies which are generally used for
drinking and cooking only, though higher income groups may use the water
for washing and other purposes as well (see op. cit. on the social
survey). Lower income groups supplement their supplies from other
sources - wells, rivers and streams, stored rainwater, or from stand-
pipes some distance away. The social survey found that 5% of the
families spend 7 hours per week collecting and carrying water, 25X 3
hours per week, and 50% 1.3 hours per week; as the amount carried by
households consuming 30 lcd comes to 6.3 tons per month, over distances
ranging from 100 to 300 meters or more, there is evidently some economic
advantage to them of (and a willingness to pay for) having standpipes
and yard-taps conveniently located; the cost figures to focus on are the
ones shown at the bottom of the table.
18.       On the above basis, the willingness of households to pay for
water in 1985 averaged N 2.2 or more per cubic mete_. For industrial
users, a figure of N1.2 per cubic meter is adopted based on an analysis



- 98 -
ANNEX 2-8
Page 7 of 8
of NIDB loans to large industries for the installation of private
boreholes, pumping and storage equipment which shows that the private
costs may be as low as N 0.2 per cubic meter for heads of 60 meters (the
depth of the second aquifer) and N 0.5 per cubic meter at 120 meters
(the depth of the third aquifer). These costs are somewhat higher than
those for the mini watervorks of LSWC, which similarly tap the second
and third aquifers, which are in the range N 0.2 to N 0.3 per cubic
meter depending on operating cost asstnptions 1/ . Costs of borehoies
may rise appreciably in future if, as is now thought, consumption at the
second and third aquifers is beginning to reach their sustainable
capacity. The potential dangers of salination are considered
significant, and a study of the aquifer capacity is included in the
project. Lastly, three large firms (including a brewery and a soft
drinks manufacturer) have sunk boreholes to the fourth aquifer at 500
meters, and installed sizeable generators, pumps and water cooling
systems; the costs incurred are not known, but simple engineering
calculations suggest they are in the range N 1.2 to 2.5 per cubic meter.
The weighted average of all users is thus N 1.8/i5, inflated to N 2.39
in 1987 prices.
19.       The costs and benefits for the base case are set out in table
1 attached, where the various assumptions described above are also
summarized. Only a gradual build-up of benefits is assumed, to allow
for lags in introducing new connections. The waterworks are projected
to operate at only 85% capacity to allow for downtime. All costs are in
1987 border prices (i.e. the domestic costs are multiplied by the SC?).
In sum, the expected benefits are as follows the (PV figures assume a
12% discount rate):

in costs, reduces the ERR to about 10%. In contrast a 10% cost savings
1/        Total investment in the mini water works at Isolo, Annuwo-Odofin,
Ikorodu and Epe, with combined capacities fo 12 mgd (36
boreholes) are worth N 30 i. The above figures correspond to O0M
assumptions of 12% and 18% of capital costs, respectively.

and a 15Z increase in benefits results in an ERR of 17% (see
attachment).
20.       The expected rate of return Is thus 13X and within the range
10 to 17%. Such high returns can be explained by the acute and growing
scarcity of water in Lagos. As the social survey has shown, perhaps
four million residents are already paying over N 1.5 to N 3.0 per cubic
meter of water, with potable water costing N 4 to 11 per cubic meter
depending on quantity purchased. The N 1.5 to N 3.0 range excludes the
significant costs of the families' own labor required for fetching and
carrying water: a typical low income family consuming 30 lcd may have to
fetch 6 tons of water per month over distances of 100-300 meters or more
to meet its most rudimentary needs. Allowing for such costs, valuing
water at N2.2 per cubic meter for households, as was done in ths above
calculations, is conservative. In contrast, the project could provide
water at a cost of N 2.16 per cubic meter, would earn a positive
financial rate of return on capital if tariffs were set to this figure,
and yet would substantially reduce supply costs and increase the volume
of water available to Lagotians - particularly to the low income groups.
Risks
21.       The risks of the project, therefore, relate not to its
economic desirability, but to LSWC's not being placed in a position to
oversee its satisfactory implementation and management. The danger is
that the merits of a full cost reflecting tariff policy, and of LSWC's
having the required administrative autonomy over the day-to-day
management of its affairs, will not be recognized de facto by the State
Government. A low tariff, for example, would undermine LSWC's capacity
to supply water - as the 'zero' tariff has done in the past.   This
would generally delay the project, increase its costs, increase the
waste of water that is supplied, and heightet. the water scarcity
problems discussed above. The achievement of a cost-reflecting tariff,
and of the administrative reforms discussed in the main report, are both
crucial for the future development of the water supply system in Lagos.
In this respect, the economic analysis converges on the same conclusion
as the financial and management analyses of the project.

Notes:
(a) Incremental Production
These figures assume that the water works eventually operate at 85% of
the rated capacity after rehabilitation. Rated capacity for the water
works is the sum of the capacity of Adiyan (70 mug or 116 Mms/year),
the incremental output at Iju made possible by the retiforcement of
the primary mains and rehabilitations (12 mgd or 20 Mm9/y) and the
rehabilitation of the mini-water works (6 mgd or 10 Mm3/year).
(b) Incremental Consumption
Full utilization of the incremental production capacity would not take
place until about 1995, owing to the time lags associated with the
construction of the tertiary and secondary mains and the connection
program. The analysis thus assumes a gradual build-up of consumption
over the 1988-1996 period. Physical losses are taken to be 30% to
1990 falling gradually to 25% by 1996.
(c) Capital Costs
Values are derived from constant price expenditures presented in
Annex 2-3, excluding institutional support. One-half of the costs for
contract 4 of the primary mains have be subtracted to reflect that the
pipes being installed are twice the size required for the initial
throughput to accomodate demand growth. Local costs have been
converted to border prices using the SCF of .85.
(d) Operations and Maintenance Costs
Values are 4% of cumulative capital costs in border prices beginning
in 1991. (See para 3 above for details).
(e) Value or Water
N 1.2/mi for non-domestic users, accounting for 30% of consumption,
and N 2.7/ms for domestic users, giving a weighted average value of
N 2.39/ms. (See para 18 for explanation).

Sensitivity Analysis
The sensitivity analysis considers various combinations of cost
overruns and savings, and benefit surpluses due to either a possible
undervaluation of the level of consumption 1/ or the value of benefits.
The resulting internal economic rates of return range from about 101 to
17%. Selected results are shown below.
% Cost       X Benefits       Err
Chanses       Increase        _
Base case: 85% capacity           0             0             13
Case 1:   100% capacity           0            15             15
Case 2:   100% capacity,
cost savings         -10             15            17
Case 3:   85Z capacity,
cost overrun         +10              0            11
Case 4:   85% capacity,         +10           -10             10
1/ Although the base case assumes that the waterworks produce at 851 of
rated capacity, it is possible that increased production and hence
greater consumption may be achieved.
