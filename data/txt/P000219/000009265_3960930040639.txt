REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
ENERGY SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:         Republic of Burundi
Beneficiaries:    Ministry of Energy and Mines  (MEM), Ministry of Rural
Development and Artisanat (MDRA), REGIDESO and ONATOUR.
IDA Credit:       SDR 16.3 million (US$22.8 million equivalent)
Terms:            Standard IDA, 40 years
Onlending Terms:  The government of Burundi will onlend a maximum of SDR 4.4
million (US$6.2 million equivalent) from the proceeds of the
Credit to REGIDESO at 8.72 percent interest rate for a period
of 25 years  (including a 5-year grace period).    The
government will bear the foreign exchange risk.
Proiect
Oblectives:       The broad objectives of the project are to promote rational
energy policies and to strengthen the efficient management
of energy resources. Specifically, the project aims to: (i)
develop efficient institutions in the sector and improve the
quality of public investment; (ii) improve the efficiency in
the use of energy resources through reforms in the pricing
structure of electricity, petroleum products and woodfuels;
(iii) expand the access of the population to electricity;
and (iv) reduce negative environmental effects of the use
of energy through the execution of charcoal efficiency and
improved stoves programs.
Proiect
Description:      The project has two major components:  institutional rerorm
and small investments in biomass, household energy and power.
The IDA Credit proceeds will support:   (a) institutional
strengthening of the Directorate of Energy and the
Directorate of Water Resources and Rural Energies (US$0.8
million); (b) a rehabilitation program for REGIDESO,
including a management assistance partnership program with
a foreign operator, training and materials (US$5.1 million);
(c) pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for selected
hydropower plants and an update of the Power Sector Master
Plan (US$3.6 million); (d) a charcoal efficiency program to
disseminate improved techniques of production and sensitize
charcoalers to the issue of deforestation (US$0.7 million);
(e) an improved charcoal stoves program (US$0.4 million);
(f) a household energy survey and a study of peat substi-
tution (US$0.4 million); (g) a Master Plan for Rural Electri-
fication (US$0.3 million); (h) extensions of the distribution



- ii -
system and new connections in rural and urban areas (US$5.9
million); and (i) improvements in the transmission system
(US$3.26 million).
Project Benefits
and Risks:          The project will lead to increased efficiency in the economy
and to an improved allocation of resources because of the
proposed pricing policies for petroleum products, electricity
and woodfuels.   It will strengthen institutions in a key
sector, thereby improving the quality of the public
investment program and efficiency in the use of energy
resources.   The project will alco improve efficiency in
woodfuels corsumption and contribute to the design of a
strategy for the management of wood resources, thereby
reducing negative environmental effects.   The investments
supported by the project are expected to yield substantial
benefits and high rates of return. The risks of slippages
in policy and institutional measures are considerably
mitigated by substantial up-front actions and a broad
consensus. No major technical risks are foreseen.

REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI
ENERGY SEC ^OR REHABILITATION PROJECT
I. TEE ENERGY SECTOR
Country Background
1.01      Burundi is a small landlocked country of 27,820 km2 with a population
estimated at about 5.3 million. The population density is estimated at 179
persons per square kilometer, the second highest in Africa. Population has
grown at a rate of about 2.9 percent per annum, but despite the demographic
pressure on an already constrained land, urban migration has been limited and
only 6 percent of the total population is urban. After Bujumbura with some
270,000 inhabitants, the next four towns have only between 10,00O and 20,000
inhabitants.
1.02      GDP per capita, estimated at about US$230 (1989), ranks among the
lowest of the continent. The GDP growth has averaged 6.2 percent in real terms
from 1985 to 1987, but was 5.2 percent in 1988 and only 1.5 percent in 1989.
The country has limited natural resources other than a relatively fertile
agricultural land.   Agriculture is the predominant activity, contributing
more than half of the GDP, 93 percent of employment and 88 percent of export
earnings.   Burundi is one of the few African countries that are self-
sufficient in food. The most important export crop is coffee, which accounts
for about 80 percent of export earnings. The secondary sector remains very
small, accounting for about 14 percent of GDP and 8 percent of exports.
Transportation costs to and from the Indian Ocean ports are high, and as a
landlocked country, Burundi is vulnerable to transportation conditions in
neighboring countries.
1.03      To correct economic and financial imbalances, the government embarked
in 1985 on a comprehensive economic reform program that has been supported by
two SALs (FY86 and FY88).  The government's program to address structural
issues includes a comprehensive package to strengthen macroeconomic management,
create an incentive framework to stimulate exports and enhance private sector
confidence, reform public enterprises, improve public expenditure management,
increase the efficiency of the financial sector, liberalize the labor market
and implement well-targeted measures aimed at alleviating poverty. The project
described in this report is an important element of the government's economic
restructuring program. It will address pricing issues in a key sector of the
economy, implement needed reforms in one of the most important public
enterprises, improve the quality of the public investment program, strengthen
institutions in the energy sector and improve the reliability of energy supply
for domestic and industrial uses. It will also address one of Burundi's major
environmental concerns through the improved charcoal stoves and charcoal
efficiency programs.

1.04      The estimated final consumption of energy from all sources is 940,500
tons of oil equivalent (toe), corresponding to 188 kilos of oil equivalent
(kgoe) per capita. Wood and other biomass meet almost 94 percent of the country
needs, while petroleum products account for 5 percent, and electricity for



- 2 -
1 percent. A national energy balance for 1988 is provided in Annex 1.1 and is
summarized in Table 1.1. The per capita consumption of modern fuels (petroleum
products and electricity) is only 12 kgoe, one of the lowest in Africa 1/, and
reflects the low income and urbanization levels, the dominance of subsistence
agriculture in the economy and the small size of the industrial sector.
However, consumption of modern fuels grew at an average annual rate of about
6 percent in the period 1980-88, considerably faster than population and GDP.
The consumption of petroleum products increased by about 5 percent per annum
and that of electricity at about 11 percent per annum.  Households, which
include small-scale commercial and artisanal activities, account for 92 percent
of total energy consumption.

Energy Resources
1.05      Biomass Resources.  The total surface covered by natural forests and
tree plantations is about 200,000 ha, or 7 percent of the country's total land
area.   Roughly,  135,000 ha are man-made plantations.    Since 1978,  the
government has initiated several large-scale afforestation projects, and a
total of approximately 46,000 ha have been planted with external funding.
While these projects have been well implemented, their impact on the supply
of wood has been limited due to the absence of a long-term forestry resource
development strategy and to the weaknesses of existing forestry institutions.
Private plantations represent 60,000 ha and provide most of the commercial wood
consumed in the country.

kgoe; Zambia: 380 kgoe. (Source: World Bank, World Development Report,
Washington, D.C., 1989.)



1.06      Total wood consumption amounts to about 2.4 million metric tons per
year, of which 17 percent is used for charcoal production. However, in terms
of end use, charcoal contributes only to 4 percent of the energy requirements
covered by woodfuels due to the low production efficiency of the carbonization
techniques used. Purchases of wood are not prevalent, and it is estimated that
only 10 percent of the wood consumed enters the commercial circuits. The low
share of commercial wood indicates that demand management using taxation and
the pricing system will have a limited impact on wood use and tree cutting.
However, the negative impact on the environment is much larger for commercial
than collected wood due to the intensive tree felling associated with
commercial charcoal production.
1.07      The total sustainable supply of wood has been estinated at 1.7
million metric tons per year, which is 70 percent of the demand. The volume
of wood demand over and above sustainable supply would represent a decline of
about 2.6 percent per year of the total standing stock of trees. This fairly
modest depletion of wood reserves could have a potentially serious impact due
to the exponential pattern of depletion developments. So far, demand appears
to have been met both in rural and urban areas without price increases in real
terms, which could indicate that the country is at an early stage of wood
resource depletion or that the data is inaccurate. In any event, there is a
clear need to develop better information on the demand and supply side of
woodfuels as a basis for formulating a long-term strategy for the sub-sector.
The proposed project will support the execution of a household energy
consumption survey (para. 4.12), while a complementary wood resource study will
be financed by the French Ministry of Cooperation and Development and made
available before June 30, 1992 to the Directorate of Energy (DGE) and to the
World Bank.
1.08     Localized deforestation problems are already evident around some
urban centers. At the same time, industrial plantations coming to maturity
are seen to yield in excess of commercial offtake (1.2 million metric tons
per year on a sustainable basis vs. 0.6 million ton per year). Access to some
of these plantations is difficult because of the road conditions, but there is
also no proper organization to manage the commercialization of wood.
1.09      Besides improvements in information and in the management of public
industrial plantations, measures should be taken to conserve woodfuels.
Consumption of woodfuels in traditional stoves is quite inefficient and there
is considerable scope for improvements. Wood in rural areas is consumed in
3-stone open fires, with an efficiency estimated at between 10 and 15 percent.
Improved wood stoves for the rural areas are the focus of an aid program from
China monitored by the Ministry of Rural Development and Artisanat. A program
to improve charcoal stoves in urban areas has been financed by IDA under the
Power Transmission and Distribution Project (Cr. 1593-BU) and will be continued
in the proposed project (para. 4.11). A total of 15,000 stoves, each saving
between 30 and 35 percent of the charcoal used in traditional stoves, have been
sold in Bujumbura since 1985, which is equivalent to 10 percent of the
charcoal-using households. At the present time, 400 improved stoves are sold
monthly. Inefficient charcoal making is also a serious problem since much wood
is wasted in the process of production. More efficient charcoal production
methods were introduced in some industrial plantations in the First and Second
Forestry Projects (Credits 918-BU and 1620-BU), but it would be necessary to



-4-
revitalize and reorganize these efforts and introduce them to traditional
charcoalers who represent the largest share of produc'ion.  Charcoal use is
related to modernization and urban households will eventually switch to its
use.  At the present time, 85 percent of the population in Bujumbura uses
charcoal and total consumption is estimated at 41,000 metric tons. Without
energy efficiency improvements, total consumption would reach 97,800 metric
tons in year 2000. The charcoal efficiency and improved stoves program (paras.
4.10 and 4.11), address the critical issue of meeting demand while reducing
environmental damage.
1.10      Hydropower.  Burundi is rich in hydropower resources.  The theore-
tical potential has been estimated at 6,000 Gwh per year, of which 1,500 Gwh
are economically exploitable. This compares quite favorably with the current
consumption of about 105 Gwh per year, indicating that the limited exploitation
is related not to the resource base but rather to the economic and financial
problems of expanding the electric system.   Some of the most attractive
national hydroelectric sites are located in the northwestern region of the
country and the proposed project will finance the preparation of a limited
number of pre-feasibility and feasibility studies (para. 4.09). Other potential
sites must be developed in cooperation with other countries, as they are found
along rivers forming boundaries.   A feasibility study for Ruzizi III was
started in 1989 under the sponsorship of the Energy Organization of the Great
Lakes Region (EGL) constituted by Burundi, Rwanda and Zaire, while the study
of Rusumo Falls was completed in 1987 under the sponsorship of the Organization
for the Development of the Kagera River (OBK), constituted by Burundi, Rwanda,
Tanzania and Uganda.
1.11      Present domestic hydropower facilities consist of 27 power plants
with a total installed capacity of 32 Mw. Two of these plants (Rwegura with
18 Mv and Mugere with 8 Mw) represent 81 percent of the total installed
capacity in the country. In addition, Burundi takes power from Ruzizi I and
Ruzizi II. Ruzizi I is owned by the Societe Nationale d'Electricite (SNEL)
of Zaire and has an installed capacity of 28.2 Mw.   Ruzizi II, with an
installed capacity of 26.6 Mw, is operated by the Societe Internationale
d'Electricite des Pays des Grands Lacs (SINELAC), jointly owned by Burundi,
Rwanda and Zaire, and was commissioned in 1989. These imports of electricity
represented about 13 percent of consumption in 1989.
1.12      Peat.   Peat is a non-renewable source of energy found in large
quantities in the country. Highland bogs are easier to exploit and do not
seem to pose significant environmental problems.   Although lowland peat
reserves are many times larger than highland resources, their extraction may
give rise to environmental problems. The production of peat in 1989 was 14,212
metric tons, all from highland bogs.  The limiting factor is demand, since
studies indicate that production could be increased to some 50,000 metric tons
per year without expansion into lowland bogs.
1.13      Present use of peat is basically limited to institutions (army,
schools, hospitals, prisons) and some artisans (bakers, brick-makers,
restaurants). It is estimated that the present consumption saves about 36,000
cubic meters of wood per year. Household consumption is insignificant because
of its inconveniences relatively to fuelwood and charcoal (smoke, smell,
ashes). Most of the drawbacks can be removed by carbonization and briquetting,



- 5 -
but a study financed by USAID concluded that this was not financially
attractive at the present prices of wood and charcoal. Peat could be used more
intensively for process heat in cottage industries, bakeries, brick and tile
factories, replacing wood or charcoal or as a substitute for fuel-oil or
electricity in industrial boilers. The largest existing industries that could
convert to peat (COTEBU-textiles, BRARUDI-brewery, VERRUNDI-bottles) have
refused to consider this option, even though conversion to peat is economically
and financially the best option. The proposed project will finance a
feasibility study to demonstrate the benefits of increasing peat utilization
in secondary industries (para. 4.13).
1.14      Petroleum.   Petroleum products account for about 80 percent of
commercial energy consumed ir. Burundi.   There is no local production and
national requirements are entirely covered by imports, representing close to
15 percent of total merchandise imports. Some exploration has been undertaken
in the Ruzizi Plain, where AMOCO drilled three exploratory wells in 1987.
The results were inconclusive and these activities are now on hold.  Total
consumption is about 50,000 metric tons and per capita consumption is only 10
kgoe, which ranks among the lowest in Africa. This is due to the modest size
and low petroleum intensity of the industrial sector and the relatively high
cost of petroleum products. Gasoline and diesel represent more than three-
fourths of total consumption, while fuel oil used in some large industrial
enterprises is only 14 percent (Annex 1.2). The use of kerosene, primarily
for lighting, is very low and has barely increased during the 1980s.
1.15      Petroleum products are currently imported and distributed by five
private companies. The largest is FINA/BP, which has a market share of about
35 percent. The government has a 20 percent participation in one of the
companies (SICOPP, with a market share of 17 percent). It has not, however,
used this to intervene in the market and confines itself only to supervision
and control, using mainly price fixing, transport and stocks regulations and
rules for establishing new societies. The private companies own the storage
facilities near the port of Bujumbura. which have a total storage capacity of
12.000 cubic meters. For security reasons, the government built a new deposit
of 20,000 cubic meters in Gitega in 1983/84, but it has not yet been used.
1.16      There are two surface routes for the imports of petroleum products.
The "northern corridor" is the route Mombasa-Nairobi by pipeline (white
products) or by truck (fuel oil), and Nairobi-Bujumbura through Uganda and
Rwanda by truck, totalling a distance of 2,190 km. Total transport cost for
gasoline is estimated at US$262 per metric ton. The "central corridor' has
two alternatives: (a) Dar es Salaam-Kigoma by railroad and Rigoma-Bujumbura
by barge on Lake Tanganyika, for a total distance of 1,428 km and a total
transport cost for gasoline of US$107 per metric ton; and (b) Dar es Salaam-
Tabora-Isaka-Bujumbura by truck, with a distance of 1,580 km and a total
transport cost for gasoline of US$254 per metric ton. A comparison of the
costs shows little difference between the two truck alternatives in financial
terms, but some stretches of the road in Tanzania are not realistically
accessible during the rainy season and the majority of transporters in Burundi
refuse to go to Dar es Salaam. The railroad/barge route is by far the most
attractive, but its use is limited by the railroad conditions in Tanzania and
its low reliability.   The private companies are free to negotiate their



purchases and to choose the supply route. It is estimated that only 8 percent
of petroleum imports come through the Kigoma route. This situation may change
if the railroad in Tanzania is improved.
1.17      Retail prices for gasoline, diesel and kerosene remained unchanged
between December 1983 and September 1990. The price of fuel oil experienced
some adjustments, but the overall increase was only 20 percent. Government
revenues decreased several times to absorb increases in international prices
and exchange rates adjustments. As of August 1990, the level of total taxation
was 22 percent for gasoline, 19 percent for diesel, 18 percent for kerosene and
28 percent for fuel oil, about half the levels in neighboring countries that
face similar high transport costs. In September 1990, petroleum prices were
increased by about 30 percent, but these adjustments only partially reflected
the new situation of international prices.  Total taxation decreased to 20
percent for gasoline and 16 percent for kerosene, while it increased to 22
percent fcr diesel and 30 percent for fuel oil.  Annex 1.3 gives the details
of the pricing structure. While importers are allowed a somewhat bigger margin
when they use the Dar es Salaam-Kigoma-Bujumbura route, this has not created
proper incentives to increase the use of the low transport cost route. Also,
the existing price structure is too complicated and regulates several specific
items that are not relevant for the policy objectives of the government.
Following an extensive dialogue, the government has agreed to implement a
simplification of the pricing structure and adopt a policy of automatic price
adjustments (para. 4.08).
1.18     New and Renewable Energies.  Burundi is relatively well endowed with
solar radiation and it is estimated that the installed capacity of photovoltaic
systems is 45 kw, of which 40 percent is used for lighting, 40 percent for
water pumping and the remainder for refrigeration and other uses. A few solar
crop dryers and solar water heaters are also in operation, mainly financed by
donors as demonstration projects. Prices for photovoltaic systems are high
and solar energy applications are, with few exceptions, not economically
viable. The expansion of its use should be left to the private sector to the
extent that it is commercially justifiable, although the government should
review the existing level of taxes and import duties for equipment and
materials.
1.19     About 140 biogas digester plants have been built with the cooperation
of external donors (Germany, China and Belgium).  The two main constraints
for the development of this resource are the availability of animals and the
initial costs. Minimum requirements are for at least four heads of cattle
which must stay in a stable or enclosure at night and few rural households
meet this constraint.  Secondly, a biogas digester costs about FBu 150,000
(US$857), which is too expensive for most rural families. The involvement of
the government should mainly be in creating awareness about the advantages of
using digesters and sensitizing potential new owners.
Energy Institutions
1.20      The government agency responsible for the energy sector as a whole
is the Directorate of Energy (DGE) in the Ministry of Energy and Mines, which
has two departments: Projects, and Research and Statistics. The foremost task
of the DGE is that of keeping an overview of the energy sector as a whole,



assessing requirements and priorities between subsectors, giving general
guidelines for subsector development and ensuring coordination. This requires
a competent planning staff with a strong background in economics, which does
not exist at the present time. The proposed project will provide support to
the DGE in these aspects (para. 4.06). Clear procedures and uniform investment
criteria for evaluating projects and programs will be established and monitored
by the DGE.   Physical planning and implementation  for each individual
subsector, on the other hand, would be the responsibility of the subsector
agency.
1.21      On the supply side of the biomass subsector, the central institution
is the Forestry Department (DF) in the Ministry for Regional Development,
Tourism and Environment. Its responsibilities include the implementation of
the government's forestry policies, the management of reserved natural forests
and the management of man-made industrial plantations.   These industrisl
plantations include four externally-financed forestry projects with a
substantial technical assistance component for the DF.   The Ministry of
Agriculture intervenes when the exploitation of wood and biomass is integrated
with farming activities. Promotion of efficiency in charcoal production has
also been the responsibility of the Forestry Department, while promotion of
efficiency in the end use of wood and other biomass has been undertaken by the
Directorate of Water Resources and Rural Energy (DGHER) in the Ministry of
Rural Development and Artisanat, by the DGE, and by the Office National de la
Tourbe (ONATOUR). The DGHER is also responsible for rural electrification and
for the promotion of new and renewable energy resources (biogas, solar, wind).
where it overlaps with the Department of Research and Statistics of the DGE,
as well as with the Burundese Research Center for Alternative Energy Resources
(CEBEA). The responsibility for the production, marketing and promotion of the
use of peat is placed with ONATOUR, a parastatal company created in 1977 and
reporting to the Directorate of Mines.   The Department of Research and
Statistics of the DGE undertakes household energy surveys and its activities
in this area would be strengthened through the proposed project (para. 4.12).
1.22      In  the  electricity  sector,  REGIDESO  is  responsible  for  the
generation, transmission and distribution in urban areas, while rural areas
fall under the authority of the DGHER.   This division of responsibilities
seems well justified. Urban and rural electricity supply are rather different
in character and call for different organizational approaches.  The DGHER,
being part of the Ministry of Rural Development, has its attention focussed on
the rural environment and has the motivation to search for solutions adapted
to each individual rural center.  Both REGIDESO and the DGHER will receive
assistance from the proposed project to improve their respective performance
(paras. 4.03 and 4.07).
1.23      In the petroleum subsector, the principal government agency involved
is the Directorate of Commerce (DGC) within the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry. This unit regulates all types of commercial activities, but it has
no particular expertise in the petroleum sector and cannot ensure coordination
with other energy subsectors or give guidelines for subsector development.
For these purposes, the DGC needs to coordinate with the DGE, but the latter
needs to develop some competence in this area and support for this would be
provided under the project.



1.24     An important new body is the National Commission for Water and
Energy, created in 1989, where all the ministries involved in the energy sector
are represented. The role of the Commission is consultative to the government,
but once its recommendations are approved, they become official policy. The
main objective of the Commission is to promote the harmonious and rational
utilization of water and energy resources. The sub-commission on energy is
chaired by the Minister of Energy and Mines, with the DGE serving as
secretariat.   This will lend considerable authority to the DGE and ensure
effective communications with all the ministries involved in the energy sector.
Government Objectives
1.25      The Ministry of Energy and Mines issued a basic document on energy
sector policy in July 1989. This document states that the objectives of the
government in the sector are to: (i) develop and rationally manage national
energy resources; (ii) provide appropriate energy for the development of rural
areas; (iii) provide low-cost energy for industry and craftsmanship;
(iv) maintain the existing energy infrastructure and make it profitable, and
(v) reduce foreign energy dependence, particularly on imported petroleum
products.   To implement these objectives,  the government has decided to
strengthen the DGE in the areas of planning, coordination and control, to
promote the connection of the most important rural centers to the electric
grid, to reinforce the training of charcoalers in more efficient techniques,
to extend the improved charcoal stoves program and to review the pricing
policies for electricity, wood and charcoal. The proposed operation would help
the government in implementing its strategy for the sector by strengthening key
institutions, financing selected investments and promoting pricing reforms.
Bank Participation in the Sector
1.26      IDA provided funds for a project to expand the power transmission
and distribution system of REGIDESO with a Credit for SDR 12.9 million
(Cr. 1593-BU) signed on June 14, 1985.  The project included: (a) a 110 kv
transmission line from Ruzizi II to Bubanza;  (b) subtransmission lines to
supply five regional towns and distribution networks in these towns;  (c)
distribution networks in six low-income districts of Bujumbura; (d) rehabi-
litation of the 70 kv transmission line from Ruzizi I to Bujumbura;  (e)
construction and equipping of a training center for REGIDESO; (f) a program
for improved charcoal stoves in Bujumbura; and (g) consulting engineering
services and technical assistance. The rehabilitation of the transmission line
from Ruzizi I to Bujumbura was not undertaken under the project because of
legal issues with the government of Zaire, but has been incorporated into a
project under execution in Zaire. The training center is under construction,
and the execution of the improved charcoal stoves program continues, but all
the other project components have been completed. The project achieved its
physical objectives, but the technical assistance was not successful because
of its limited nature and lack of commitment from high level management. To
improve the performance of REGIDESO, a comprehensive rehabilitation program has
been included in the proposed project. This program is part of a Performance
Contract signed between the management of REGIDESO and the government and is
monitored by an interministerial monitoring committee. A foreign operator has
been called to assist in managing the enterprise (paras. 3.12 and 4.03).



1.27      IDA also financed the construction of the Ruzizi II hydroelectric
power plant that is jointly owned by Burundi, Rwanda, and Zaire (Credits
1419-BU, 1420-RW and 1421-ZR) and two forestry projects (Credits 918-BU and
1620-BU) which have subsequently created important new energy supply options.
The Ruzizi II power plant has been successfully completed and is operational
since June 1989, but the issue of pricing the energy sold has not been fully
resolved. The forestry operations established about 13,000 ha of pine and
eucalyptus plantations and provided some training for charcoalers.  A more
efficient model of charcoal stoves was developed under the Urban Development
Project  (Cr.  1049-BU).       The  Nickel  Exploration/Engineering  Project
(Cr. 1154-BU) helped to finance the trial peat production in the Akanyaru
Basin. Under the Joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Assessment Program, a complete
review of the energy sector was done in 1981 and in 1990. As indicated in
para. 6.01, this last study supplied the basic framework for the proposed
project.
II. THE POWER SUBSECTOR
Demand for Electricity
2.01      The consumption of electricity in Burundi reached a level of 105.3
Gwh in 1988 and of 102.2 Gwh in 1989, representing a per capita consumption of
around 20 kwh, one of the lowest values in the world. Only 1.5 percent of the
total population uses electricity and 82 percent of the total consumption is
concentrated in Bujumbura.  Sales by REGIDESO are 92 percent of the total,
while auto-producers account for about 7 percent of consumption and the DGHER
for about 1 percent. The average annual rate of growth of consumption was 10.8
percent in the period 1980-88 and 6.8 percent in the period 1985-88. In 1989,
there was a decline in the consumption of electricity of around 3.0 percent,
which is explained by the temporary closing of the most important consumer
(VERRUNDI-bottle manufacturer) and a general decline in industrial activity.
Industry and commerce account for about 47 percent of the total consumption.
2.02      The number of consumers has increased from 5,408 in 1980 to 13,799
in 1989, an average annual growth rate of 10.6 percent.  The DGHER has 362
users, and REGIDESO 13,437, of which 13,283 are low voltage and 154 medium
voltage. The number of new clients connected to the system of REGIDESO was
645 in 1988 and 1,507 in 1989. The increase is explained by the new policy
on connections established within the rehabilitation plan of the institution.
The 10 largest users of electricity are VERRUNDI (bottle manufacturer),
COTEBU (textiles), BRARUDI (brewery), BRAGITA (brewery), OCIBU (coffee), the
University of Burundi, three hotels in Bujumbura and REGIDESO itself. In a
normal year, these users account for about 45 percent of the total consumption
of electricity.
2.03      Consumption per domestic household is estimated at 2,300 kwh per year
and has declined systematically over the years. This phenomenon is explained
by the fact that the expansion of electrification progressively reaches areas
of lesser development and lower incomes. Given the low proportion of the
population which has access to electricity, this trend is likely to continue
in the future. Before 1980, only two towns (Bujumbura and Gitega) had electric



- 10 -
service.   At  the end of 1989,  there  are 54 centers with  electricity
(Annex 2.1), of which 25 are located in the interconnected grid. Bujumbura has
about 270,000 inhabitants and the next four towns (Gitega, Ngozi, Kayanza,
Rumonge) have between 10,000 and 20,000 inhabitants. There are only 18 urban
centers with a population of more than 5,000. This demographic structure is
very costly to the objective of increasing the access of population to electric
services, and makes rural electrification of crucial importance for the
country.
2.04     Another major obstacle to expand the number of consumers has been
the high cost of connections.  Until July 1989 all new users had to make a
lump-sum payment equivalent to the cost of the individual connection plus a
participation in the extension of the grid.   Since high-standard imported
materials were used, the charges were quite high. Average connection charges
have been estimated between US$500 and US$750. In 1989, these charges were
decreased to cover only the individual connection, and term payments of up to
24 months were allowed.   Low cost equipment has been imported and average
connection charges have decreased to about FBu 35,000 (US$200). This largely
explains why 1,507 new users (a 9.3 percent increase) were connected in 1989.
Nevertheless, the electrification rate in Bujumbura is estimated to be only
around 20 percent, and a substantial number of connections requests remains
unfulfilled because of deficiencies  in the supply of materials  and in
organization and planning.   The new connection policy of REGIDESO will be
supported by improvements in the internal organization and planning for the
execution of connections, which are included in the Rehabilitation Plan of
REGIDESO to be financed under the proposed project. Financing for an intensive
program of new urban connections (para. 4.17) and for rural electrification
(para. 4.15) is also included.
2.05      Statistical methods are not appropriate to project the future evolu-
tion of electricity consumption in Burundi. Growth will depend fundamentally
on actions by the government and REGIDESO to increase the number of new
connections or on the connection of some new large industrial consumers, which
is unlikely. An average growth rate of 6 percent per year has been applied for
planning purposes. This rate is similar to the rate observed between 1985 and
1988 and has been obtained using the methodology applied by Electricite de
France International (EDFI) in the Power Sector Master Plan.   Production
requirements are estimated on the basis of a gradual decrease of total losses
from the level of 20 percent observed in 1989 to 15 percent by 1995 and to 12
percent by 2000.  Peak demand is calculated on the basis of 5,100 hours of
utilization. The values of consumption, production and peak demand for the
period 1989-2000 are given in Table 2.1 for the electric system of REGIDESO.

2.06      Based on these demand projections, energy and capacity balances were
constructed and are presented in Annex 2.2.   The guaranteed energy from
existing domestic hydroelectric plants is estimated at 102.0 Gwh, and the
energy available to Burundi from Ruzizi I and Ruzizi II Gwh under the agree-
ments already in pla-e is 59.7 Gwh. In this situation, existing plants and the
available supply from Ruzizi I and II can satisfy all consumption requirements
until 1995.  However, REGIDESO is negotiating with SNEL an increase in the
energy available from Ruzizi I, and a recent hydrology study in the region
indicates a possible increase in the energy available from Ruzizi II (SINELAC,
R66valuation du Productible de la Centrale Hydroelectrique Ruzizi II, February
1990). Under these circumstances, an additional power generating plant would
not be needed before 1998. If the third unit of Ruzizi II is added before that
date, the need for a new plant may even be postponed for another year.
Generating Capacity
2.07      Total production of electricity in Burundi was 124 Gwh in 1988 and
126 Gwh in 1989, including 116.6 Gwh and 117.3 Gwh respectively from the system
of REGIDESO.   There are 27 hydroelectric power plants in operation in the
country with a total installed capacity of 32.2 Mw. REGIDESO operates seven
plants with a total installed capacity of 30.6 Mw, which represents 95 percent
of the total. Two of these plants represent over 80 percent of the total
installed capacity in the country (para. 1.11).   The DGHER operates eight
plants with a total capacity of 0.8 Mw and auto-producers, most of which are
religious missions, have 12 hydroelectric power plants with a total installed
capacity of 0.8 Mw.   Of the total hydroelectric power plants, 17 have an
installed capacity of less than 200 kw (Annex 2.3) and can be classified as
micro-hydro.
2.08      Besides the domestic power plants, Burundi gets hydroelectric energy
from Ruzizi I and Ruzizi II.  The average energy that can be produced in
Ruzizi I is estimated at 148 Gwh per year. A rehabilitation of this plant is
under execution. The energy from Ruzizi I is received as payments for debts
of SNEL with REGIDESO and with the Banque de la Republique du Burundi (BRB).
Payments for the first debt are fixed at 12.8 Gwh per year until July 2005, and
for the second one at 17.6 Gwh per year until June 1991. However, REGIDESO
has not consumed all the energy that is due, and SNEL has accumulated debt over
and above what is established in the agreements. At the end of 1989, the
balance to be paid by SNEL was 66.8 Gwh on the convention SNEL/BRB and
255.3 Gwh on the convention SNEL/REGIDESO.  Ruzizi II is jointly owned by
Burundi, Zaire and Rwanda and operates since July 1989 with two units and a
total installed capacity of 26.6 Mw. Average available energy is estimated at
141 Gwh per year, of which REGIDESO is assumed to use one third.   Recent
studies suggest that the available energy could be increased to 197 Gwh with
two units and 223 Gwh with three units (para. 2.06).
2.09      REGIDESO has ten thermal power plants with an installed capacity of
about 10.0 Mw. Several of these groups are old, and it is estimated that only
about 5.0 Mw are really available. The biggest thermal plant is in Bujumbura
and has a nominal capacity of 7.4 Mw, but since several of its units date from
1953/54, the available power is only about 3.0 Mw. This plant is used mainly
for reserve purposes. The production of electricity from the thermal plants of
REGIDESO is about 2 percent of total production and is likely to decline as



- 12 -
some additional isolated centers are connected to the electric grid where
production is entirely hydroelectric.   Thermal units  installed by self-
producers have an estimated capacity of 6.3 Mw, with the largest groups in
some tea factories (Tora: 456 kw, Rweguras 468 kw, Tezat 375 kw).
Transmission and Distribution
2.10     A map in the back of the report shows the power network of Burundi.
The interconnected system includes the province of Bujumbura, Bubanza,
Cibitoke, Kayanza, and Ngozi, and the localities of Tora and Mugamba in the
province of Bururi, and Gisozi, Mwaro and Kibumbu in the province of Muramvya.
Gitega and Muramvya will be incorporated in 1991 when the 110 kV transmission
line between Bujumbura and Gitega is completed. The principal transmission
lines are the 110 kV lines from Ruzizi II and Rwegura to Bujumbura (RN1), the
70 kV line from Ruzizi I to Bujumbura (SNEL), the 35 kV line from Mugere to
Bujumbura (Ozone) and the 30 kV lines that feed Kayanza, Ngozi, Ijenda, Tora
and other localities. The total length of the high and medium voltage line is
estimated at 818 km.
2.11     While the interconnected network is being expanded radially, there
are two separate sub-systems under development.  The first is in the south
and will interconnect Nyanza Lac, Rumonge, Makamba, Rutana, Gihofi and Bururi
with the Nyemanga hydroelectric power plant (1.4 Mw) through 30 kV transmission
lines. The second is in the north-east and will connect Cankuzo, Muyinga,
Karuzi and Kirundo with the micro-hydropower plants of Murore (24 kw), Kayenzi
(800 kw), Buhiga (240 kw), and Marangara (240 kw), also through 30 kV
transmission lines.
Future Developments in Power Generation
2.12      The theoretical hydroelectric potential of Burundi has been estimated
at 6,000 Gwh per year (Lahmeyer International, Etude du developpement des
ressources hydroelectriques du Burundi, August 1983), but in practice only
around 1,500 Gwh in some 40 projects could be economically exploited.  The
most attractive potential national projects are located in two distinct regions
of the country: (i) the northwestern region, where the Gitenge-Kagunuzi and the
Kaburantwa rivers are important tributaries on the east side of the Ruzizi
river and have an estimated potential of about 100 Mv, and (ii) the southern
region, where the Mulembwe, Jiji, Ru7ibazi and Miyovozi rivers have a potential
of about 24 Mw.  As indicated above (para. 1.10), other possibilities that
would need to be exploited in cooperation with other countries are found on the
Ruzizi river (Zaire and Rwanda) and on the Ruvubu-Kagera rivers (Rusumo Falls
with Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda).
2.13      Of the existing power plants, Rwegura (18 Mw) is located in the
northwestern region, while Nyemanga (1.4 Mw) is in the southern region.
There are possibilities of expanding the capacity of Nyemanga to 2.8 Mw, but
this will have to wait for the expansion of consumption in the southern grid.
The characteristics of the principal possible domestic new projects are given
in Annex 2.4 with their costs per installed capacity and per average
production. The most interesting domestic projects are Mule 34, Jiji 03,
Kabu 16 and Kabu 23.  Since Mule 34 and Jiji 03 are in the southern region,



- 13 -
which is not connected to the main network serving the principal consumption
centers, the costs of constructing the corresponding interconnection
transmission lines must be added to the total cost of these projects.
2.14      In the northwestern region, the Kaburantwa and Kagunuzi rivers can
be developed independently or jointly. In the first case, four sites can be
developed on the Kagunizi river (Masango, Rushiha, Kagu 10 and Kagu 06) down-
stream from the Rwegura power plant and two sites can be developed on the
Kaburantwa river (Kabu 16 and Kabu 23). If the rivers are jointly developed,
a big reservoir would be created on the Kagunuzi river (the Kagunuzi C project)
and used to irrigate the Imbo valley to the south and, at the same time, to
produce electric energy. In a next stage, the waters of the Kaburantwa would
be diverted through a tunnel to the reservoir and used either in an extension
of the Kagunuzi power plant (the Kagunizi D power project) if there is need of
additional water for irrigation or, if not, in an independent power plant
(Kagunuzi A). The joint development of the rivers implies the disappearance of
the Kabu 23, Kabu 16, Kagu 10 and Kagu 6 projects and their replacement by
Kagunuzi C plus the siphoning of the Kaburantwa river plus either Kagunuzi A
or Kagunuzi D.
2.15     A comparison between the independent and joint development of the
Kaburantwa and Kagunuzi rivers was done in the Power Sector Master Plan
(Electricite de France International, Plan Directeur National d'Electri-
fication, December 1988). According to this study, with equal conditions of
electric service and at a discount rate of 10 percent, the joint development
of both rivers has a cost that is 35 percent higher than the independent
development in the case of limited irrigation (Kagunuzi A) and 50 percent
higher in the case of maximum irrigation (Kagunuzi D).
2.16      The only domestic project for which a feasibility study has been done
is Kagunuzi C, which is not the least-cost alternative for the expansion of
the electric system. The proposed project will finance pre-feasibility studies
for Kabu 16, Kabu 23, Rushiha and Masango, which are some of the best sites
available in the country (para. 4.09).  Since the interconnection with the
southern grid has not been done and is not envisaged in the near future, the
studies of Mule 34 and Jiji 06 have been postponed. The studies financed under
the proposed project, together with those of Kagunuzi, Ruzizi III and Rusumo
Falls, would be used for the selection of the future least-cost power plant
that is required for the expansion of the electric system.
Operations and Maintenance
2.17      The comparison between production and consumption in 1989 (111.3 Gwh
versus 93.8 Gwh) implies that total losses in the electric system of REGIDESO
are of the order of 20.0 percent.  The comparable figure for 1988 was 15.6
percent, which indicates a substantial increase in losses.   These figures
include the consumption of the auxiliary services and of the resistances in the
power plants that are necessary to avoid cavitation in the machines. If these
uses are excluded, total losses were 18.7 percent in 1989 and 13.9 percent in
1988. These magnitudes indicate that actions to improve performance and reduce
losses are required. A detailed plan to reduce technical and non-technical
losses will be presented to the Bank before September 30, 1991.



- 14 -
2.18      Losses in transmission lines and their associated transformers were
of the order of 3.7 percent of net production in 1989, which is somevhat on
the high side given the small network of REGIDESO. This is specially the case
for the 35 kV line Mugere-Bujumbura (Ozone), where losses are calculated at
5.2 percent of net production.   Losses at the distribution level are high
(15.6 percent of the energy supplied in 1989 and 12.5 percent in 1988), which
is explained in part by the old age of the network in Bujumbura and Gitega,
which is in need of urgent rehabilitation. While there is no data to separate
technical and non-technical losses, there are indications that the latter are
also important, due to observed deficiencies in meters, metering and billing.
An ongoing intensive program of testing and recalibrating the electric meters
in Bujumbura has found deficiencies in about 20 percent of them. As part of
the rehabilitation plan, REGIDESO will continue to check all electric meters
in its system and adopt strict measures of control to avoid billing mistakes
and the theft of electricity, thereby reducing its non-technical losses.
At the same time, the rehabilitation of the distribution systems of Bujumbura
and Gitega will be undertaken with financing from KfW-Germany which will also
reduce losses.
2.19      The number of incidents that interrupt electric service is also quite
high. For example, during March 1989, there were five recorded interruptions
at the level of high/medium voltage and 27 incidents in the low-voltage
distribution system of Bujumbura. In October 1989, there were eight and 25
incidents respectively.  While some of these incidents are due to natural
causes that cannot be avoided, the quality of maintenance of the electric
network is, in general, low. The personnel in charge of maintenance lacks
adequate training, the stocks of spare parts and materials (especially in the
interior of the country) are inadequate and there are deficiencies in the
logistical support necessary for effective maintenance (communications and
transport). The planning of maintenance is too general and, with the exception
of Rwegura, there are no detailed programs of preventive maintenance for each
of the power plants, sub-stations and high/medium voltage transmission lines.
REGIDESO will present a detailed preventive maintenance plan for all its system
before September 30, 1991.
2.20      The operation of the principal newer hydroelectric power plants,
where service started quite recently (Rwegura, Mugere, Nyemanga), is
satisfactory, but almost all the other hydroelectric power plants of REGIDESO
and DGHER have experienced operational difficulties. Giheta (1983), Ruyigi
(1982) and Buhiga (1984) were not in operation at the end of 1989, Ruvyironza
(1980-84) has had problems in all its turbines and Marangara (1986) was out
of service several times in 1989 due to deficiencies in lubrication, regulation
and electronic equipment.
2.21      Isolated centers that are supplied exclusively from thermal power
plants have electric service only during some hours of the day. This is due
to the high cost of operation and the low level of revenues. In some places
(Rutana, Cankuzo), provincial authorities pay directly for the fuel and have
even received foreign assistance for this purpose. The state of these thermal
groups is unknown, but routine maintenance is not done at all or is deficient.
Whenever there is a failure, the community remains without service for extended



- 15 -
periods of time. Since most of these centers should be under the responsibility
of the DGHER, the problem will be examined within the Master Plan for Rural
Electrification to be financed under the proposed project.
Electricity Tariffs
2.22      Electricity tariffs in effect in January 1990 were approved by a
decree of the Minister of Commerce and Industry dated March 29, 1989.  For
low-voltage users, there was only a constant energy charge of FBu 15/kwh
(US$0.086 per kwh). Medium-voltage users had a fixed charge for subscribed
capacity of FBu 6,000/kw per year (US$34.3 per kw par year) and an energy
charge that varies with the hours of utilization:   (i) FBu 13/kwh
(US$0.074 per kwh) for the first 150 hours of utilization of the subscribed
power; (ii) FBu 12/kwh (US$0.069 per kwh) for a utilization between 150 and
450 hours; and (iii) FBu 9/kwh (US$0.051 per kwh) for utilization above
450 hours. The decree of March 29, 1989 replaced tariffs that existed since
March 1, 1988.
2.23      Studies of the long-run marginal cost of electricity and the reform
of the tariff structure were done by Electricite de France in April 1985 and
December 1988. A more detailed and complete study was done by an independent
consultant in December 1989 (Fernando Lecaros, Etude de Restructuration des
Tarifs d'Electricite) as part of the preparation for the proposed operation
and, based on it, the government decided to implement in April 1990 a
comprehensive electric tariff reform.   Medium-voltage electric rates were
immediately adjusted to the estimated long-run marginal cost values, while for
low-voltage users, the adjustment was phased in with an initial increase of
27 percent for all consumption above 375 kwh per month.   A social tariff for
consumers that use less than 75 kwh per month was established. They are at the
present time about 3,600 consumers in this group (approximately 30 percent of
the total), but they represent only about 1.6 percent of total consumption (or
7.4 percent of residential consumption). The tariff reform also eliminated the
free electricity received by high government officials and the personnel of
REGIDESO.  Table 2.2 presents the electricity rates as of January 1990 and
April 1990 and the long-run marginal costs.

Rural Electrification
2.24      The Directorate of Water Resources and Rural Energy (DGHER) of the
Ministry of Rural Development has developed several micro-hydro power plants
(Annex 2.3) and built transmission and distribution lines to provide services
to some rural centers. Because of a lack of trained personnel in the DGHER and
the small size of the plants and their dispersion, these actions have not been
very successful. The operation of the plants is always precarious and inter-
ruptions of service and extended repairs are common. Administration, billing
and collection are inefficient.  Improvements in management, operations and
maintenance of the DGHER electric system are urgently needed and are included
as part of the proposed project (para. 4.07).
2.25     At the present time, of the 115 municipalities, 32 have their main
village electrified, while 83 completely lack electric service. The Ministry
of Energy and Mines has recently completed a catalogue of these villages, with
a preliminary indication of the potential markets and possible source of
electric energy, but priorities have not been determined, and no economic
analysis of individual projects has been done. New micro-hydro power plants are
expensive, and the approach is now to connect new rural lines to the network
of REGIDESO.  Since the distances are relatively small and there is excess
energy in the network, this decision could make economic sense. The responsi-
bilities for the administration, operation and maintenance of the new rural
systems also has to be defined. DGHER has not demonstrated effectiveness in
administration and most of the rural centers are not financially attractive
to REGIDESO, which is itself struggling to become a profitable commercial
enterprise. An alternative would be to make the municipalities responsible for
the administration and have them pay REGIDESO for the required technical works,
but this possibility requires further analysis of the financial situation of
municipalities and assistance to organize the management of the municipal
electric systems.   Another alternative is to use some local institutions
(church, cooperatives) that have close links to the community. All these issues
will be examined in the Rural Electrification Master Plan financed under the
proposed project (para. 4.14)
TII. THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES
3.01      The Borrower will be the government of the Republic of Burundi.
The Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) will be responsible for the overall
coordination and supervision of the program and will directly implement some
of the activities in the biomass and household energy components. REGIDESO
will be the implementing agency for the power subsector components and the
DGHER for rural electrification.
A. REGIDESO
Organization and Management
3.02     REGIDESO  is  a  government-owned  public  enterprise  created  and
organized by the Decree No. 1/196 dated October 2, 1968.  Its objectives are                E
to generate, transmit and distribute electricity, to pump, treat and distribute



- 17 -
water and to execute or supervise studies and works for new electricity and
water facilities. REGIDESO is under the supervision of the Ministry of Energy
and Mines (MEM).   Responsibility for day-to-day operations lies with the
General Manager, who is assisted by three managers, all appointed by the
President of the Republic. The Technical Manager is in charge of electricity
and water operations, maintenance and garage, and supervises two deputy
managers who are responsible for the electricity and the water departments.
The Administrative and Financial Manager is in charge of four units: personnel,
accounting, corporate budgeting and control, and inventories supplies. The
Commercial Manager supervises three unitss billing, revenues collection and
relations with clients. Recently, the utility has been reorganized into four
regions, each of them headed by a regional manager directly reporting to the
General Manager.
Staffing and Personnel
3.03     At the end of December 1989, REGIDESO employed 899 permanent agents
and about 1,100 temporary agents. Temporary agents are supposed to be used
only in the execution of new projects, but in practice many work on a permanent
basis. The ratio of total electricity and water customers to permanent agents
was 27;1, which represents a low level of efficiency.   In the Performance
Contract signed with the government in July 1989, REGIDESO agreed to increase
this ratio to 50:1 by 1992, which would imply a substantial reduction in the
number of permanent agents (up to at least 300). There are 70 cadres (managers
and university graduates), or 8 percent of total staff, and 829 skilled and
unskilled workers. Staff is allocated as follows: 445 for electricity, 236 for
water, and 118 for administration and finance.
3.04      REGIDESO has problems with regard to the capability and efficiency
of its work force. These problems are primarily the result of difficulties
in recruiting qualified personnel.   To upgrade the job qualifications of
existing employees, the previous IDA supported project (Cr. 1593-BU) financed
the construction of a training center and the design of a training program to
increase the skills of specialized workers in mechanics and electricity, both
to be executed by GTZ-Germany. The construction, however, was delayed and
REGIDESO has not fully implemented the training component defined in the
project. The construction of the training center will be completed by March
1991 and GTZ has updated the training programs and will start implementation
immediately after construction. Promotion and salaries incentives are given
on the basis of seniority and hierarchy rather than on qualifications and job
performance.   As a result, in many cases supervisors lack the skills and
knowledge required for their jobs.
3.05      The Rehabilitation Program that will be financed under the project
(para. 4.03) includes an expert in human resources and personnel management,
who will be in charge of introducing new personnel management policies in the
areas of recruitment, performance evaluation and salary incentives. He will
also supervise all training activities. The project will also include training
for managers, supervisors and non-technical personnel (administration,
accounting and commercial aspects), which were not included in the previous
project.  During negotiations, the government agreed that by September 30,
1991: (a) REGIDESO would complete a detailed manpower study that includes an



- 18 -
assessment of required positions and a strategy to reduce personnel and
increase productivity, and (b) REGIDESO would submit a detailed training plan
for all its staff.
Accounting, Audit and Insurance
3.06      REGIDESO has an acceptable accounting system and maintains its books
in accordance with internationally accepted accounting practices. Accounts
are kept on an historical cost basis and foreign debt and transactions are
revalued annually at prevailing year-end exchange rates. All exchange gains/
losses are treated in accordance with international standards. However, the
obsolete status of the mechanographical system used to maintain the accounts
causes significant delays in the flow of accounting information. The Financial
Department requires assistance to help strengthen management, and the
accounting systems and procedures need to be computerized.  Urgent actions
needed include the recruitment of a new Accounting Chief, proper staffing of
the newly created Internal Auditing Department, and the design and implemen-
tation of an appropriate management information system. Under the proposed
rehabilitation program, REGIDESO would implement, with the support of both
new recruits and the management assistance team, the necessary changes and
improvements. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from REGIDESO that
recruitment of the chiefs of the Accounting Division and the Internal Auditing
Unit would take place before Credit effectiveness.
3.07      REGIDESO's accounts for FY88 and FY89 have been audited by external
auditors. The audit report for FY88 was heavily qualified, particularly
regarding REGIDESO's inability to reconcile the general balance with a number
of individual balances and the inventory levels with the use of spare parts.
Furthermore, the reports indicated that there is no reliable accounting system
for capital works and that the costs of projects are obtained from incomplete
estimates.   These deficiencies were partially corrected in FY89, but the
shortages of qualified personnel and equipment limit what can be effectively
done. With the improvements envisaged in the flow of financial information
through the automation of its accounting and financial information system and
the strengthening of the internal audit function, it is expected that REGIDESO
would be in a position to correct the noted deficiencies. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that REGIDESO would continue to provide the Bank
annually with audited financial accounts no later than six months after the end
of each fiscal year.
3.08      REGIDESO  insures  against  most  common  risks  associated  with
electricity operations with the National Insurance Co. of Burundi, which is
a government-owned concern. The coverage does not reflect the devaluations of
the Burundi Franc, nor does it take into account the realistic values of its
assets.   REGIDESO would review its insurance practices to ensure adequacy and
cost effectiveness, and bid for competitive insurance premium costs, as there
is now a private insurance company in Burundi.
Management Information Systems
3.09      REGIDESO suffers from poor internal communications and the lack of
timely information necessary for an effective management. With the exception
of the computerized fixed asset management system financed through Cr. 1593-BU



- 19 -
and recently implemented, REGIDESO lacks major automated systems. The Rehabi-
litation Program financed under the proposed project (para. 4.03) will assist
REGIDESO in establishing  (a) appropriate policies, practices and business
procedures for improved consumer billing, collection procedures, budget
management and accounting; (b) a comprehensive data processing plan; and (c)
requirements for computers and software. The project will also finance the
purchase of some urgently needed equipment.
Assets Revaluation
3.10      The study to revaluate REGIDESO's fixed assets was financed under
Cr. 1593-BU.   The historical value of fixed assets in service during 1988
should increase, according to the study, from FBu 21.8 billion tL. FBu 53.4
billion.  This change would increase depreciation charges to more than FBu
2 billion and substantially increase the accounting losses of REGIDESO
(para. 5.04). To compensate for this situation, and as part of the financial
restructuring of REGIDESO (para. 5.08), the government has agreed to take
responsibility for unprofitable past investments and allow REGIDESO to deduct
from its operating expenses the corresponding depreciation charges. A study
to identify these investments will be conduced by a foreign consultant and is
expected to be completed by June 30, 1991. At the same time, in accordance
with internationally accepted accounting practices, part of the revaluation
surplus will be used to absorb exchange losses, thus helping in the financial
restructuration of the enterprise. Overall, the results of the revaluation
exercise are positive.   In addition to the possibility of absorbing the
exchange losses, it allowed REGIDESO to review the accounting classification
of all its fixed assets and implement adequate depreciation rates for each
category, improve its inventory and reconstitute a card-index box for about
7,400 items, implement an improved management eystem for fixed assets, create
a unit for this purpose dnd train its staff to efficiently operate the new
system.
Performance Contract
3.11     A comprehensive  study of REGIDESO vas completed by a foreign
management consultant in April 1989.  The suggisted Rehabilitation Program
was reviewed by the government and approved by a-Zl the principal donors that
contribute to the financing of REGIDESO (KfW a-. GTZ from Germany, Caisse
Centrale-France, and the World Bank).   This pr-rram was incorporated in a
Performance Contract signed 1etween the government and REGIDESO in July 1989
(Annex 3.2).   To ensure effective implementation, a Monitoring Committee
consisting of representatives from the Ministries ox Finance and Energy and
Mines and from the Service Charge des Entreprises Publiques (SCEP) was created.
3.12      In compliance with the Performance Contract, the government increased
electricity tariffs in April 1990, restructured the Board cf Directors of
REGIDESO, paid all public debts as of December 31, 1988 and authorized a
capital iucrease as compensation of past debts. Some improvements have already
also been noted, such as a new policy to increase connections (from 645 in 1988
to 1507 in 1989), the reduction to 15 days in the delays for billings, the
placing of cash surpluses in revenue producing bank accounts, the reduction in
personnel (230 in 1989), the implementation of a program to review and control
electricity meters, the application of automatic cuts of electricity for



- 20 -
delinquent accounts (2156 in three months), and the creation of Planning and
Internal Auditing Units. To help REGIDESO implement the Performance Contract
to its full extent the project will finance a Management Assistance Partnership
Program with a foreign operator experienced in the management and rehabilita-
tion of public utilities (para. 4.03). The operator will have responsibility
for some key activities in the financial, commercial, planning and personnel
management areas of REGIDESO and his remuneration will partially depend on the
overall results obtained by the company. This will be complemented by short-
term assistance for some specific needs, such as computerization and management
information systems. The integrated and comprehensive arrangement is given a
better chance of success than the ad hoc technical assistance previously
financed by many donors, including the World Bank. However, the results will
depend on the commitment and willingness of REGIDESO's management to act and
on a close supervision of the operation by the Bank.
B. The DGHER
Organization and Management
3.13     A Department of Water Resources and Rural Energies within the
Ministry of Rural Development was established in February 1979 with the
responsibility of improving the supply of potable water in rural areas and
implementing rural electrification. By Decree No. 100/209 dated December 22,
1988, this department became DGHER, with one department for energy, and another
one for water. The Decree No. 100/13 dated March 11, 1986, limited REGIDESO's
operating responsibility to 22 urban centers and brought all other centers
under the responsibility of DGHER. However, this distribution of responsibi-
lities is not being followed at the present time and REGIDESO is increasingly
providing water supply and electricity services to some secondary and tertiary
centers. This issue will be examined in the Rural Electrification Master Plan
financed under the project. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from
the government that: (a) a proposal for a new delineation of responsibilities
in rural electrification between REGIDESO and DGHER would be submitted to the
Bank before June 30, 1992 and (b) the government would implement the agreed
recommendations before December 31, 1992.
3.14      DGHER is headed by a Director who is appointed by the President of
the Republic upon nomination of the Minister of Rural Development and Artisanat
(MDRA).   DGHER has been the implementing agency for a Rural Water Supply
Project financed by IDA (Cr. 1625-BU), which is an advanced state of imple-
mentation.   A new project in this sector is programmed for FY91.  In general,
administration and accounting for both water supply and rural electrification
are weak. The proposed project will provide technical assistance and training
to improve the performance of DGHER, assisting in organizing the commercial and
financial aspect of rural electrification (para. 4.07).
3.15     DGHER's financial performance has to be assessed as that of a
department of a Ministry. While DGHER enjoys some independence, its financial
operations are embodied in the government budgetary system. With the exception
of revenues associated with installing electricity meters and billing for
electricity at the same rate as REGIDESO, DGHER does not have any financial
resources of its own. These resources amounted to FBu 60.7 million in 1988,
while the contribution from the government was FBu 87.4 million. DGHER will



- 21 -
therefore continue to rely on the government appropriations and donors'
contributions to sustain its operations and investments.   The new rural
electrification projects to be financed under the proposed project are not an
additional financial burden on the operating budget of the DGHER as, in all
cases, sufficient revenues will be generated to cover the costs of operations
and maintenance.  Agreement was obtained during negotiations that for all new
rural electrification projects: (a) the internal economic rate of return will
be at least 10 percent, (b) projected revenues will cover operating and
maintenance expenses; (c) an adequate billing and revenue collection system
has been designed and will be in place at the end of project execution;
(d) consumers will be required to pay connection charges with a down payment
before execution; and (e) tariffs for rural electrification would be the same
as those established for REGIDESO.
Staffing and Personnel
3.16      In July 1990, DGHER's staff amounted to 100 employees, of which 55
were employed in electricity operations. Approximately 20 percent of the staff
is permanent and paid according to the salary structure of the public sector,
which is significantly lower than that of parastatal agencies like REGIDESO.
The remaining 80 percent are contractual personnel who may enjoy higher wages,
but do not have the benefits of those permanently employed and may be dismissed
at the end of their contract. To achieve operational and managerial efficiency
in the new rural electrification projects and improve DGHER's operations, a
project manager will be named within the existing administrative structure, and
a finance/accounting expert will be recruited and financed under the project.
This expert will work in close cooperation with the technical adviser already
in place financed by the Belgian Cooperation. A description of the scope of
work of the expert is provided in Annex 3.1. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained from DGHER that the project manager would be appointed and that
the expert would be recruited before Credit effectiveness.
Accounting and Auditing
3.17      The law establishing DGHER  specifies that its accounts are to be
kept on an accrual basis using the double entry system and in accordance with
the national accounting system plan.   In practice accounts and financial
reporting systems are primarily set up to determine compliance with the
authorized limits of the budgets for recurrent expenditures and investment.
Neither consolidated nor separated balance sheets or profit and loss accounts
exist for its water supply and electricity operations.   It is therefore
difficult to abstract information and statistics on annual operating costs for
these services.
3.18      Consumer  billing  is  presently  limited  to  DGHER's  electricity
operations in five centers, where the same tariff as REGIDESO is currently
used. New consumers payments for the installation of a connection is a lump
sum.  To what extent meters are regularly read, bills distributed and the
revenues collected is difficult to assess at present given the dispersion in
the provision of services in the country's interior. Initially, in an effort
to promote electricity  consumption,  DGHER  installed connections without
up-front payments and did not require regular payments of electricity bills.
This resulted in arrears of about FBu 3 million as of December 31,1989, of



- 22 -
which 80 percent relate to electricity sales and 20 percent to connection
charges.   Whilst the major part (70 percent) is due from private sector,
30 percent is due from government agencies.  One of the major tasks of the
finance/accounting expert would be to improve billing and revenue collection,
as well as the accounting systems.
3.19      Systematic  reporting  regarding DGHER's  operations  is weak  and
somewhat irregular. Though a yearly report covering DGHER's operations has
been prepared in the past, its scope and depth has varied considerably over
time. The finance/accounting expert financed through the project is expected
to establish a monthly and quarterly management reporting system and to ensure
that balance sheets, income statements and fund flow statements are prepared
shortly after the end of DGHER's financial year. Further, this expert will
provide procedures as to how to allocate expenditures between water supply and
provision of electricity.
3.20      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from DGHER that it
would: (a) provide to the Bank quarterly reports covering the progress in the
execution of the project and other operations according to a system of agreed
monitoring indicators; (b) starting in FY91 produce separate accounts for its
water and electricity operations, and (c) prepare for FY91, and every fiscal
year thereafter, yearly balance sheets, income statements and fund flow
statements in sufficient detail to allow for identification and assessment of
its various activities.
3.21     Under the Rural Water Supply Project, DGHER agreed to have its
accounts and financial statements audited by an acceptable external auditor
and to submit them to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal
year. DGHER has not been able to meet the six month deadline because of the
weakness in its finance/accounting division, as described earlier. Audited
accounts for FY87 and FY88 were received with delays up to one year. The
audited financial statements for FY89 are not yet available. The reports are
heavily qualified and the auditors highlight the existence of a defective
communications system between DGHER and the municipalities that should pay for
water supply, the incomplete recording of accounting transactions, the lack of
accounting procedures and deficiencies in the follow-up and monitoring of
billing, collection and transfer of revenues. Because of these deficiencies,
the accounting books do not provide a completely reliable and accurate picture
of the financial position of DGHER. The requirement to submit audited accounts
within six months of the year-end is likely to be observed because of the
improvements in accounting and in the preparation of financial statements
resulting from the technical assistance to be provided by the project.

IV. THE PROJECT
Project Obiectives
4.01      The broad objectives of the project are to promote rational energy
policies and to strengthen the efficient management of energy resources.
Specifically, the project aims to: (i) develop efficient institutions in
the sector and improve the quality of public investment; (ii) improve the
efficiency in the use of energy resources through reforms in the pricing
structure of electricity, petroleum products and woodfuels; (iii) expand the
access of the population to electricity; and (iv) reduce negative environ-
mental effects of the use of energy through the execution of charcoal
efficiency and improved stoves programs.
Project Description
4.02      The main features of the project are summarized as follows:
(a) Energl Sector Institution Building
(i) implementation of a Rehabilitation Program for REGIDESO that
includes a management assistance partnership program with a foreign
operator, a restructuring of the financial base of the enterprise,
the construction of limited new facilities to improve operations and
training for its personnel; (ii) pre-feasibility and feasibility
studies for selected hydroelectric power projects and an update of
the power sector Master Plan; (iii) institutional strengthening of
the DGE in the Ministry of Energy and Mines so that it can assume its
leadership role in the areas of planning, coordination and control
of the energy sector; (iv) institutional strengthening of the DGHER
in the Ministry of Rural Development so that increased access to
electricity in rural areas be achieved efficiently; (v) implemen-
tation of pricing policies reflecting the economic cost of supply in
electricity, petroleum and woodfuels; and (vi) coordination and
monitoring of the public investment program in the energy sector;
(b) Biomass and Household Energy
(i) execution of a Charcoal Efficiency Program to disseminate
improved techniques for the production of charcoal and sensitize
charcoalers to the issue of deforestation; (ii) continuation of the
Improved Charcoal Stoves Program which aims at reducing charcoal and
wood consumption; (iii) a household energy consumption survey to
improve knowledge on energy demand and help the planning process; and
(iv) a feasibility study of peat substitution in secondary industries
to determine the viability of increasing the use of these resources;
(c) Rural Electrification
(i) Rural Electrification Master Plan to evaluate potential projects
in rural areas; and (ii) execution of some economically justified
extensions of the distribution network in rural areas;



- 24 -
(d) Power Subsector
(i) doubling of the 110 kV transmission line from Bubanza to
Bujumbura and extensions in associated substations; and (ii)
implementation of an intensive program of new connections and
extension of the distribution network in urban areas.
4.03     Management Assistance Partnership Program.  This program has been
defined after a comprehensive diagnostic study executed by a foreign management
consulting firm and has been included in the Performance Contract between the
government and REGIDESO signed in July 1989 (para. 3.11). The defined actions
will be implemented by a foreign operator experienced in the management and
rehabilitation of public utilities. The selection of the operator has been
completed and approved by the Bank. The initiation of activities took place
in November 1990, financed by a PPF advance. The operator will provide five
experts for up to three years each and for a total of 12 person-years. These
experts are:   (i) an economist who will be responsible for evaluating and
monitoring the investment programs and for organizing the recently created
planning unit; (ii) an expert in commercial management in charge of imple-
menting measures to increase the number of customers, to improve billing and
collection and to reduce the account receivables; (iii) an expert in finance
and accounting who will be in charge of implementing measures to improve the
general accounting system, the internal controls and the management information
system; (iv) an expert in human resources and personnel management who will be
in charge of implementing measures to reduce personnel, increase productivity
and rationalize policies in the areas of recruitment, job and performance
evaluation, and payment incentives; (v) an expert in purchasing activities in
charge of implementing an adequate procurement and stock management system.
In addition, the operator will establish, implement and follow up a master plan
for informatization. The total cost for these services is estimated at
US$3.7 million.
4.04      To complement the above activities, GTZ-Germany will continue to
provide foreign experts in the technical areas of electricity and water
operations and IDA will finance experienced local accountants for up to three
years, at a total cost of US$190,000. In addition, since at the present time
REGIDESO's employees are dispersed in different rundown buildings, which
produces loss of time and productivity and makes efficient informatization
almost impossible, improvements in the physical facilities have been included
in the Rehabilitation Program. A commitment from the government to contribute
to the financing of the construction of new headquarters for REGIDESO has been
given.   IDA will finance the imported material and equipment and a small
portion of the civil works, up to a total of US$1.0 million. Detailed studies
will be conducted under the responsibility of the REGIDESO and will be
submitted to the Bank before September 30, 1991.
4.05      Training for REGIDESO under the project is intended to complement
what was financed under the Power Transmission and Distribution Project
(Cr. 1593-BU). Those programs were developed to increase the skills of
specialized workers in mechanics and electricity.  Additional programs for
managers, supervisors and other professional staff, including those in the
areas of accounting, administration and marketing, will be introduced.   A
detailed training plan will be presented to IDA before September 30, 1991.



- 25 -
The cost of this component is estimated at US$0.5 million. The Rehabilitation
Program is completed by a financial restructuring of REGIDESO that is detailed
in para. 5.09.
4.06      Institutional Strengthening of the DGE. This component will support
the recently created Planning Unit and the Department of Research and
Statistics, that will be in charge of household energy matters. The project
will cover the services of a planning expert (economist) for intermittent
missions over a period of two years, advanced training in project analysis
and planning techniques and equipment. The estimated cost is US$0.5 million.
As a result of this assistance, clear procedures and uniform investment
criteria   for the sector will be established.   The DGE will assume the
responsibility of coordinating and monitoring the public investment program
(PIP) in the energy sector, and the technical assistance will help them in
this endeavour. During negotiations, it was agreed that the DGE would prepare
an annual report on the PIP in the energy sector and review it with the Bank.
4.07      Institutional  Strengthening  of  the  DGHER.    The  DGHER  needs
strengthening in accounting, collection and billing to be able to effectively
manage rural electrification activities. At the same time, DGHER should have
the capacity to undertake itself the economic analysis of potential new
projects.   The project will finance an expert in commercial and financial
management,  as well as some training in economic analysis.   The cost is
estimated at US$200,000.
4.08      Energy Pricing Policies.  As indicated in para. 2.23, the government
has already taken actions to implement an electricity rate structure based on
long-run marginal costs of supply. In April 1990, medium voltage rates were
adjusted to the estimated long-run marginal cost values and substantial
increases were approved for low-voltage users.   During negotiations,  the
government agreed to a further adjustment in low-voltage tariffs before June
1991 and in yearly discussions with the Bank on electricity and water rates.
Petroleum prices were adjusted by about 30 percent in September 1990 to reflect
increases of prices in international markets. A study to reform the pricing
structure and define a new pricing policy was prepared by the Bank.   The
government has agreed to adopt a policy of automatic price adjustments before
Credit effectiveness and to reform the petroleum pricing structure by
September 30, 1991. The project will also finance studies of charcoal and wood
pricing (para. 4.10) that would lead to recommendations about changes in their
structure and levels.
4.09      Hydroelectric Power Plant Studies.  As indicated in para. 2.16, the
proposed project will finance pre-feasibility studies on four sites: Masango,
Rushiha, Kabu 16 and Kabu 23. An update of the production and transmission
Master Plan would then be carried out, so as to select the least-cost
alternative for the future expansion of the electric system, and a feasibility
study would be completed for two of the above-indicated projects. The cost of
these activities has been estimated at about US$3.5 million.
4.10      Charcoal Efficiency Program.   The objectives of the program are to
reduce the amount of wood used in the production of charcoal by introducing
energy efficiency improvements and to improve living conditions in rural areas.
Actions to be undertaken during execution include: (i) a detailed study of the



- 26 -
sector and of the relation among charcoalers, wood-owners, transporters,
wholesalers and retailers; (ii) the organization of training and demonstration
sessions of improved charcoal producing techniques; (iii) the creation of an
association of professional charcoalers; (iv) a sensitization campaign on
deforestation problems and solutions; and (v) studies and recommendations to
improve the charcoal/wood pricing structure. The project will finance for a
period of up to three years a local team consisting of a project coordinator
and three charcoal trainers, as well as short-term assistance from national and
expatriate specialists, vehicles, and equipment.   The total cost of this
program amounts to US$615,000.
4.11      Improved Charcoal Stoves Program. The objectives of this program are
to reduce the consumption of charcoal in Bujumbura and other cities, thereby
reducing energy expenditures of low income urban households, and to establish
a self-sustaining basis for the production, distribution and commercialization
of improved stoves. The stoves will be produced by independent artisans and
NGOs or private companies will be involved in the sale and distribution,
eventually financing the production activities and arranging for quality
control. Activities undertaken under this component include: (i) technical
training for stove producing artisans; (ii) establishment of an appropriate
commercialization process; (iii)  diversification of the stove models to be
produced; (iv) implementation of publicity campaigns, and (v) surveys to
evaluate the penetration rate, the savings achieved in the consumption of
charcoal and the problems of commercialization. IDA's financing will cover the
cost of local personnel, national and expatriate specialists, equipment and
vehicles. The total cost of these activities over three years is estimated
at US$315,000.
4.12     Household Energy Consumption Survey.   The proposed survey will
collect statistical data per geographical zone and type of household on the
level of consumption of energy, the end-use per type of energy and the
potentials for substitution. Training will be provided so that this task will
be continued on a regular basis without external assistance. The total cost
is about US$169,000.
4.13      Feasibility Study of Peat Substitution.  The study will examine the
technical, financial and economic feasibility of converting the boilers of
some selected secondary industries to peat, procure and test one peat boiler
system, and determine the viable market for peat in the industrial sector.
The study would be executed by expatriate consultants under the responsibility
of ONATOUR. The estimated cost amounts to US$263,500.
4.14     Rural Electrification Master Plan.  The DGHER has a list of projects
that it wishes to undertake in the future, but no economic analysis has been
done and no priorities have been established. The Master Plan will evaluate
all potential projects on the basis of technical, economic and financial
criteria and give their ranking according to economic priorities. For each
project, a comparison between extending the transmission lines from the
national power grid and developing local sources of energy (diesel generator,
micro-hydro sites) will be made. Institutional issues, such as the relations
between REGIDESO and DGHER, responsibilities of municipalities and partici-
pation of local organizations, will also be examined. Terms of reference for
the Master Plan have been reviewed by IDA and execution will start in May 1991



- 27 -
and will be financed by a PPF advance. The study will be executed by foreign
consultants at a cost estimated to be US$300,000. Local personnel will assist
in data gathering and analysis.
4.15      Rural Distribution Projects.  During the preparation of the project,
the economic feasibility of a certain number of rural electrification projects
has been established (para. 6.10), and they will be financed under the proposed
operation. These are mainly short extensions from existing lines or connec-
tions to the network of some isolated centers already electrified.   Other
projects would be identified in the Master Plan. IDA's financing will cover
the cost of all imported material plus the wood poles to be purchased locally,
while the government will finance the construction, engineering and supervision
of the lines and substations. These activities will be executed by the DGHER
assisted by Belgian experts who are already in place. The total cost for this
component amounts to US$3.2 million.
4.16      Doubling of the Bubanza-Bulumbura Transmission Line.   Under the
existing configuration of the transmission system, a single-circuit 110 kV
line between Bubanza and Bujumbura carries all the power from both the Rwegura
and Ruzizi II power plants. The proposed project would finance the execution
of a similar 28 km 110 kV line in parallel to the existing one, plus the
necessary additions to both the Bubanza and Bujumbura (RN1) substations.
The design would be the same as that of the existing line and substations.
The first five towers at Bujumbura's end are now double-circuit and they will
be used to install the additional line. Therefore, the entrance into the city
will not require additional rights of way and the impact on the population will
be almost negligible.   The total cost of the line and additions to the
substations,  including  engineering  and  supervision,  is  estimated  at
US$3.4 million.
4.17      Connection Program.  This program aims at increasing the number of
urban households with access to electricity by extending the distribution
network in areas which are already electrified. The proposed project would
help finance imported material for about 5,000 new connections, 100 km of
medium voltage lines and 50 km of low voltage lines. As in the Rural
Electrification component, the design would be as economic as possible, with
single phase aerial connections and wood poles. The experts financed by
GTZ-Germany will provide assistance to REGIDESO for the preparation of bidding
documents, construction and supervision. The estimated cost of the program is
US$4.0 million.
Project Costs
4.18      Project costs are detailed in Annex 4.1 and summarized in Table 4.1.
Total cost, including physical and price contingencies and duties and taxes,
is estimated at US$32.2 million, of which US$21.1 million (66 percent) are
foreign exchange costs. The cost estimates of the energy sector institution
building, biomass and household energy and of the rural electrification Master
Plan have been prepared by IDA, while the costs of the other components have
been estimated by REGIDESO or the DGHER, reviewed by IDA and found to be
reasonable. Physical contingencies of 10 percent were added to each component
to provide an allowance for unforeseen increases in the volume of work. Price
contingencies assume local inflation of 8 percent in 1990/1991, 7 percent in



- 28 -
1992/1993, and 6 percent thereafter, and international inflation rates of
2.7 percent for 1990, 2.6 percent for 1991, 4.1 percent for 1992, 5.4 percent
for 1993, 4.7 percent for 1994, and 3.6 percent for 1995.

Project Implementation
4.19       A Project Preparation Facility has been approved for the financing
of the Management Assistance Partnership Program and the Rural Electrification
Master Plan. Procurement for the first activity was completed to the satisfac-
tion of the Bank, and the selected operator has been in place since January
1991. The terms of reference for the execution of the Rural Electrification
Master Plan have been agreed upon, and work is expected to begin in June 1991.
Work on all other components of the project would follow the detailed schedule
attached as annex 4.2. The physical execution of the project would be completed



- 29 _
by December 1995.   A mid-term review by the government and IDA will be
organized by November 1992 to assess the project achievements and take the
corrective actions that may be needed.
4.20      A Project Management Unit  (PMU) will be established within the
Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), which will have the responsibility of
coordinating and supervising the various implementing agencies (Annex 4.3.).
Agreement was reached during negotiations that, as a condition of effective-
ness, the PMU would have a local manager and sufficient staff to carry out its
duties. The PMU manager will report directly to the Director General of Energy.
Each implementing agency will establish a focal point for project implemen-
tation within their existing administrative framework, hereafter referred to
as Project Implementation Units (PIUs). The PIUs to be established include:
(a) REGIDESO: for the transmission line Bubanza-Bujumbura, connections and
distribution program, Rehabilitation Program and hydropower feasibility
studies; (b) DGHER: for the Rural Electrification Master Plan, the rural
electrification projects and the charcoal efficiency program; (c) ONATOUR: for
the feasibility study of peat substitution. IDA will provide financial support
to establish the PMU (US$200,000 for project administration and management).
During the execution of the various components, the local institutions will be
assisted when necessary by consultants and contractors who will work under
terms of reference and technical specifications satisfactory to the Bank.
Annual auditing of the project accounts will be performed by external auditors
satisfactory to the Bank. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the
Bank would receive the report of the auditors within six months after the end
of each fiscal year.
4.21      Implementation  of  the Biomass  and Household  Energy Component.
The Charcoal Efficiency Program will involve three institutions: the DGE,
responsible for the studies on pricing and taxation of woodfuels and charcoal
and the survey of the sector; the Department of Rural Energies in the DGHER,
responsible for the training of the charcoalers, the assistance to the
associations of charcoalers and the sensitization campaign on deforestation
problems and solutions; the Forestry Department (DF), responsible for the
charcoaling demonstrations in industrial plantations, and the elaboration
of guidelines for the utilization and commercialization of wood in these
plantations. A project coordinator, reporting to DER, will head a local team
providing the training to charcoalers, with the support of national and
expatriate experts. For the Improved Charcoal Stoves component, the responsible
entity will also be the DGE, which will be in charge of involving NGOs and the
private sector in the sale and distribution of the stoves.   The household
energy consumption survey will be executed by the Department of Research and
Statistics in the DGE, with the assistance of national and expatriate
specialists. The peat substitution feasibility study will be conducted by
foreign consultants under the authority of ONATOUR.
4.22      Implementation of the Rural Electrification Component.  The Rural
Electrification Master Plan will be carried out by a consulting company
selected by the DGHER in accordance with Bank's guidelines.   The rural
extension projects will be executed under the authority of the DGHER by private
companies or directly by the construction teams of the DGHER or REGIDESO. The
engineering studies will be done by DGHER assisted by the Belgian experts who
are already in place. All new rural electrification projects will be included



- 30 -
in the public investment program of the energy sector that will be reviewed by
the Bank. During negotiations it was agreed that the DGHER will only execute
projects where the economic rates of return are above 10 percent, projected
revenues cover operating and maintenance expenses and an adequate billing and
revenue collection system has been designed and will be in place at the end of
execution (para. 3.15).
4.23      Implementation of the Power Subsector Component.  Engineering and
construction of the 110 kV transmission line Bubanza-Bujumbura will be executed
by foreign or local companies under the responsibility of REGIDESO.   The
connection and distribution program is also   under the responsibility of
REGIDESO, and engineering and construction will be done by its employees,
assisted by the experts from GTZ-Germany. During negotiations, agreement was
reached that the investment program of REGIDESO would be reviewed annually by
the Bank and that only projects with economic rates of return greater than
10 percent and financial rates of return greater than 8 percent would be
included. If the government wants REGIDESO to undertake investments with lower
rates of return, a subsidy must be given to the enterprise and the Bank must
agree.
Consulting Services
4.24      The execution of the project will require consulting and engineering
services for the Management Assistance Partnership Program to REGIDESO, the
hydroelectric power feasibility studies, the charcoal efficiency and improved
stoves programs, the household energy survey, the peat substitution study, the
Rural Electrification Master Plan, and the final design, preparation of bidding
documents, supervision and construction of the 110 kV transmission line. The
government has agreed to hire all consultants and engineering service in
accordance with World Bank guidelines and short listing and competition will
be used for all contracts estimated to cost US$100,000 or more.
Procurement
4.25     All construction services, materials and equipment to be financed
by the proposed IDA Credit would be purchased in accordance with World Bank
guidelines. International competitive bidding (ICB) procedures will be used
for all contracts above US$100,000. For smaller contracts, up to an aggregate
maximum of about US$1.0 million, limited international bidding or shopping on
the basis of at least three quotations from at least two different geographical
areas would be used. For some materials and civil and construction works, up
to an aggregate maximum of about US$0.5 million, local competitive bidding
(LCB) procedures satisfactory to the World Bank will be used.   A country
procurement assessment mission conducted in 1986 found the existing local
procedures generally acceptable, except for preferential treatment for local
bidders.    In  this  project,  preferences  for domestic manufacturers  and
constructors will follow the provisions of the Bank's procurement guidelines.
A summary of procurement methods is presented in Table 4.2. All invitations
to bid, proposed awards and final contracts estimated to cost the equivalent
of US$100,000 or more will be subject to prior IDA reviews; this represents
about 90 percent of IDA financing.   In all cases, the Bank's sample bid
documents will be used. No advance contracting or retroactive financing would
be required in this project. The Management Assistance Partnership Program and



- 31 -
the Rural Electrification Master Plan are being financed under a OPF advance
(para. 4.19). The other large consulting services contract will be that for
the feasibility studies of hydropower plants  (about US$3.7 million).   For
electrical materials and equipment, purchases will be packed in orders of about
US$1.0 million to attract foreign suppliers.

Financing Plan
4.26      The proposed IDA Credit of US$22.8 million will finance about 71
percent of the estimated project cost of US$32.2 million and 95 percent of
the foreign currency expenses of the project (US$20.6 million). IDA will also
provide US$3.2 million for local costs, which represents 28 percent of the
local project costs  (US$11.6 million).   The government will provide US$5.6
million, of which US$1.5 million will come from a grant from CIDA-Canada.
REGIDESO will provide US$3.8 million. Table 4.3 summarizes the financing plan
for which further detail is provided in Annex 4.4. IDA financing will be used
to cover: (a) all foreign costs with the exception of those financed by the
grant from CIDA-Canada; (b) the total cost of the energy sector institution
building and biomass and household energy component, except for the



- 32 -
construction of the new facilities for REGIDESO where only about 25 percent
will be financed; and (c) 50 percent of the local costs of the rural
electrification projects (for wood poles and other materials to be purchased
locally and the transport of foreign materials).

4.27      The government of Belgium is interested in participating in the
financing of the rural electrification component. An agreement in principle
was reached that they would follow the evaluation procedures established in
the Credit and accept the results of the revisions done by the Bank. No firm
commitment on amounts and dates have been given, but it is expected that they
will finance some additional projects identified in the Master Plan.   The
Belgium Cooperation has also agreed to let the Belgian experts at the DGHER
collaborate and give support to the preparation, engineering and supervision
of all rural electrification projects, including those financed by IDA.
GTZ-Germany is providing technical assistance to REGIDESO in water and
electricity operations that complements the activities of the project for the
Rehabilitation Program and would also provide support in the implementation of
the connections and distribution program. CIDA-Canada would give a grant to
the government to partially finance the consultants that will help implement
the Rehabilitation Program of REGIDESO.
4.28      During negotiations, agreement was reached that the government would
onlend to REGIDESO up to US$6.2 million of the proceeds of the proposed Credit
at 8.72 percent interest rate for a period of 25 years, including a 5-year
grace period and that the government will assume the exchange risk.   The
indicated amount corresponds to the total IDA Credit for physical investments
in the power subsector. A contract acceptable to the Bank would be signed
before Credit effectiveness.
Disbursements
4.29      The proceeds of the Credit would be disbursed over 5 years against
100 percent of foreign expenditures for equipment, materials and vehicles and
80  percent  of  items  procured  locally.    Consulting  services,  technical
assistance and training would be disbursed against 100 percent of expenditures,
but ensuring that no local taxes are included in the contracts. Disbursements



- 33 -
for civil works would be made against 100 percent of foreign expenditures and
80 percent of local expenditures. Because the nature of the project requires
close supervision, no Special Accounts are recommended. The closing date for
the Credit would be June 30, 1996.  The disbursement schedule presented in
Annex 4.5 has small differences with the standard profile for Bank loans and
IDA credits for power projects because of the special nature of the operation,
which has a large technical assistance component and only limited investments.
Monitoring and Reporting
4.30      Progress reports will be submitted to the Bank every three months.
The structure of these reports will be defined during the first supervision
mission. The proposed supervision plan is detailed in Annex 4.6. Preparation
of a project completion report not later than six months after project
completion was agreed during negotiations.
Environmental Considerations
4.31      The construction of the proposed transmission and distribution
facilities does not have any significant environmental impact. Commonly known
and well-tried construction practices would be used and the selected routes
would be parallel to existing lines or roads. Moreover, the use of the already
built double circuit towers in the suburbs of Bujumbura would eliminate most
of the disturbances on the population that could have been caused by the
construction of the Bubanza-Bujumbura (RNI) transmission line. For the
hydropower feasibility studies, full consideration to environmental aspects
will be given during the preparation of the terms of reference and the
supervision of the studies. Environmental experts would be associated with all
phases of this work in order to integrate environmental issues at the earliest
stage of design. The improved charcoal stoves and carbonization programs are
expected to have positive environmental impacts because increased efficiency
in the use and production of charcoal will reduce wood cutting and
deforestation.
V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Past Financial Performance and Present Position
5.01      Salient features highlighting REGIDESO's historical operating results
and present positions are summarized in Table 5.1 and are shown in detail in
Annex 5.2.
5.02      REGIDESO's revenues from the sales of electricity and water have
increased from FBu 1,542 million in 1987 to FBu 1,836 million in 1989. This
represents an increase of about 20 percent, which is rather small when compared
to the 95 percent increase in total expenses. However, the relatively small
increase in operating revenues is partly compensated by the increases in other
revenues, which include works executed by the enterprise and government
subsidies, that rose from FBu 248 million in 1987 and FBu 1,073 million in
1989. Government subsidies were FBu 186 million in 1989, and represented a
substantial increase compared to the Fbu 16 million of 1987 and FBu 1 million



- 34 -
of 1988. The poor performance of revenues is primarily due to limited sales
associated with the inadequate connection policies and lack of materials to
meet the demand (para 2.04), but low tariffs and poor billing and collection
practices have also been a contributing factor.

/ Including Exchange Losses
5.03      Operating expenses before depreciation, exchange losses and interest,
amounted to FBu 949 million in 1987 and FBu 1,205 million in 1989, which
represent an increase of 27 percent.   Depreciation has increased from 692
million in 1987 to FBu 1,210 million in 1989, which is an increase of about
75 percent, while exchange losses have gone up from a zero value in 1987 to
FBu 2,806 million in 1989. Interests increased from FBu 658 million in 1987 to
923 million in 1989, which is an increase of 40 percent. Excessive capital
investments, inordinate borrowing and the devaluation of the FBu have brought
total expenses to levels incompatible with revenues. As a result, REGIDESO's
losses increased from FBu 331 million in 1987 to FBu 3,303 million in 1989.
As indicated in the above table, depreciation plus interest charges and
exchange losses represented about 75 percent, 209 percent and 170 percent of
REGIDESO's total revenues in 1987, 1988 and 1989 respectively and without
concrete actions in these areas the overall financial performance cannot
improve. The actual operating ratios were respectively 70, 216 and 179.



- 35 -
5.04      The actual rate of return on non-revalued fixed assets fell from
1.1 percent in 1987 to -12.3 percent in 1988 and -12.5 percent in 1989.
These rates are obviously below those established in the agreements of
Cr. 1593-BU.   The revaluation exercise, with a multiplying coefficient for
fixed assets of 2.45, would result in more than doubling of the depreciation
charges and would increase REGIDESO's total losses.  The current ratio was
1.19 in 1989 reflecting the excessive level of receivables for the sales of
electricity and water, which were equivalent to nine months of billing as of
December 31, 1989.
5.05      The  Rehabilitation  Program  that  is  included  in  the  project
incorporates the following actions to improve the performance of REGIDESO:
(i) a management assistance partnership program with a foreign operator who
will take over some key managerial responsibilities (para. 4.03); (ii)
implementation of a financial restructuring plan that includes a substantial
capital increase, a revaluation of assets and other financial measures
(para. 5.08); (iii) reductions in personnel from the 899 permanent agents at
the end of 1989 to about 600 agents in 1993 (para. 3.03); (iv) training
programs for all types of personnel (para 4.05); (v) implementation of an
intensive program of new connections in urban areas (para. 4.17); (vi) annual
reviews of electricity and water tariffs (paras. 4.08 and 5.06); (vii) a close
supervision and monitoring of future investments to ensure that they have
economic and financial rates of return of at least 10 percent (para 5.06);
(viii) implementation of an effective billing and collection program that
includes systematic cuts in the supply of electricity for delinquent consumers
(para. 5.11); and (ix) improvements in administrative buildings and facilities
(para. 4.04).
5.06     Most of the measures indicated in the above paragraph are also
included in the Performance Contract signed between REGIDESO and the government
in July 1989.    Implementation  is supervised by a Monitoring Committee
integrated by representatives from the Ministries of Energy and Mines and
Finances and the Service Charge des Entreprises Publiques (SCEP). However,
during negotiations agreement was obtained on the following actions:
(i) further adjust low-voltage energy tariffs before December 31, 1991 and
annually exchange views with the Bank on adjustments in electricity and water
tariffs; (ii) require that all new investments undertaken by REGIDESO have
economic rates of return of at least 10 percent and financial rates of return
of at least 8 percent and submit for approval by the Bank all proposed
investments above US$650,000; (iii) submit before September 30, 1991 a proposal
for the construction of a new administrative building and for other required
improvements in the facilities of REGIDESO; (iv) pay all water and electricity
invoices from the central government within 60 days of reception.
Financial Restructuring
5.07      REGIDESO's balance sheets for 1988, 1989 and 1990 are summarized in
Table 5.2.   The capital structure is very weak. In 1988 and 1989, accumulated
losses amounted to FBu 6,233 million and FBu 9,536 million respectively, and
total equity was negative. A compensation of cross-debts between the govern-
ment and REGIDESO as of December 31, 1988 led to an increase of REGIDESO's
capital for 1990 of about FBu 1,641 million, but total equity remained
negative. Even with the gradual improvement projected in its operating income



- 36 -
from 1991 through 1995, REGIDESO will continue to accumulate accounting losses
due to the excessive depreciation, interest and exchange losses. Therefore,
it is clear that REGIDESO's capital needs to be subject to a substantial
restructuration.
5.08      On the basis of the audited accounts for 1989, REGIDESO's capital
restructuring would require an additional increase of capital of FBu 10.4
billion for operating income before interest to become positive and to achieve
an acceptable debt/equity ratio.   This amount has been incorporated in the
balance sheet for 1990 presented in Table 5.2. The capital increase can be
done without any new cash outlays from tho- government. As a first step, the
outstanding current liabilities owed by REGIDESO to the government, estimated
at about FBu 3.4 billion, would have to be converted into equity. In addition,
KFW-Germany and CCCE-France will have to agree to use part of their loans to
the government for investments by REGIDESO that will be forgiven, as a further
increase in equity. These matters are under study by the government. Finally,
the ongoing revaluationt exercise is expected to result in a revaluation surplus
of about FBu 25.4 billion that, according to internationally accepted
accounting practices, could be used to absorb exchange losses and further help
in the financial restructuring of REGIDESO.

Arrears and Collection
5.10      The balance on receivables  for 1988 and 1989  is presented in
Table 5.3. Receivables from the private sector amounted in December 1989 to
73 percent of the total and represented 7.5 months of sales. At the end of
March 1990, 41 percent of the amount due had been paid so that arrears
represent 4.4 months. The government paid in 1989 through compensation of debts
all the balances due from itself and the municipalities as of December 31,
1988. However, the municipalities have not paid the consumption of 1989, and
in March 1990 their balance on receivables was about 12 months of consumption.
A third of the receivables of the government are from the National Television,
but some sectors of government (health, education) have also accumulated
balances in 1989 equal to 12 months of consumption. A policy of systematic cut-
off of electricity for delinquent accounts was established in September 1989
and 2,156 interruptions, equivalent to 16 percent of total consumers, were
carried out within a three-month period.

5.11      Procedures for billing and revenue collection have been deficient,
but REGIDESO has recently introduced some improvements, including:   (a) a
reduction of the billing delays from 45 days after consumption to 15 days;
(b) a sensitization campaign on local television and radio; (c) monthly
reporting of arrears and receivables; (d) increased controls of meter readers;
and (e) power cuts for customers in arrears. These actions have resulted in
some improvements in billing and collection, but additional measures are
needed. During negotiations, agreement was obtained that: (a) a comprehensive
program to further improve billing and revenue collection would be presented
before September 30, 1991; (b) the average age of receivables from the private
sector would be reduced to five months of sales by December 31, 1991 and to
three months by December 31, 1992; (c) the government would settle the invoices
received from REGIDESO for its own consumption of water and electricity within
60 days of receipt; and (d) REGIDESO will systematically cut the supply of
electricity to delinquent consumers, including the government, its agencies and
the municipalities.

Future Financial Position
5.12      The projected financial statements of REGIDESO from 1990 to 2000
are presented in Annexes 5.2 to 5.4. while Annex 5.1 gives the assumptions
used. A summary of forecasted operating results and selected indicators is
given in Table 5.4. With the actions mentioned earlier (paras. 5.05 and 5.08),
operating income before interest payments becomes positive in 1990 and
increases to FBu 2,171 million in 1995.   All expenses,  including interest
payments, are covered by revenues in 1993. REGIDESO contributes in 1990 to
about 33 percent of its investment program and is able to maintain a similar
figure in the future without difficulties.   However, the rate of return on
fixed assets is only 0.9 percent in 1990, 2.9 percent in 1991 and 4.9 percent
in 1992. The debt service coverage ratio improves from 1.17 in 1990 to 2.22
in 1995. REGIDESO's liquidity position bec. .- comfortable with an increase
in the current ratio from 1.19 in 1990 to 1.69 in 1995 and the debt/equity
ratio also remains satisfactory throughout the period.

5.13      With  improvements  in  management  and  operational  efficiency,
satisfactory investment programs, adequate electricity and water tariffs and
the financial restructuring package described above, REGIDESO can obtain full
financial viability.   The financial objectives that have been agreed upon
during negotiations are the following: (a) starting in 1992 and every year
thereafter,  REGIDESO will  generate  internal  funds  to  finance  at  least
30 percent of its investment program; the corresponding figure for 1991 will
be at least 20 percent; and (b) the debt service coverage ratio will be at
least 1.2 in 1991 and 1.5 in all succeeding years and REGIDESO will not incur
in new debts unless a satisfactory forecast shows that this ratio will be
complied with. Before the end of November of each year, the govermnent and
REGIDESO will review with the Bank the financial projections of REGIDESO and
agree on measures to achieve the defined targets, including the adjustments of
tariffs.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
6.01      The proposed project will implement the main recommendations of the
1990 Joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector Assessment Report of Burundi. This
study recommended: (i) the strengthening of the Directorate of Energy (DGE)
to prepare and implement procedures and criteria for energy planning, including
household energy matters; (ii) the acceleration of the implementation of the
reform plan for REGIDESO; (iii) the revitalization of the much-needed improved
charcoal stoves and carbonization programs; (iv) the execution of a national
household energy survey; (v) the design of a strategy for the management of
wood resources; (vi) the elaboration of a comprehensive rural electrification
master plan, and (vii) the preparation of a limited number of feasibility
studies for the development of specific hydroelectric sites. The project
includes actions to implement all these recommendations. A national inventory
of wood resources and yields to complement the study of household fuels would
be financed by the government of France and made available to the DGE and the
Bank. The Energy Assessment also concluded that appropriate energy pricing
reflecting the economic cost of supply is the most important instrument for
effective demand management and recommended the review of the level and
structure of prices and taxation of petroleum products, wood, charcoal and
electricity. These pricing issues are a cornerstone of the proposed operation.
6.02      The project is also a logical extension of ongoing IDA structural
adjustment operations in Burundi. It will strengthen institutions in a key
sector of the economy and it will contribute to improve the quality of the
public investment program and the efficiency in the use of public resources.
Investments in the energy sector represent about 10 percent of the public
investment program, while subsidies to REGIDESO are about 22 percent of total
government subsidies to public enterprises. The proposed package of pricing
policies for petroleum products, electricity and woodfuels should also lead to
increased efficiency in the economy and to an improved allocation of resources.
Given its economic importance and the consequence of its deficit over public
finances, REGIDESO was one of the eight enterprises identified as priority in
the first phase of the public enterprise reform program. The Second Structural
Adjustment Credit (Cr. 1919-BU) financed the basic study on which the
rehabilitation program of REGIDESO to be implemented in the project is based.
6.03      The project also addresses important environmental concerns.   An
estimated 90-95 percent of wood production in Burundi is for domestic energy
consumption in the form of fuelwood and charcoal. Data related to forestry and
woodfuels are poor, but for certain areas of the country there are already
quite significant imbalances between wood consumption and sustainable supply
and environment problems which seem to be emerging. The overall demand and
supply balance of wood indicates that the country may be in the earlier stages
of a process of wood depletion.   Through the improved charcoal stoves and
carbonization programs the project will improve efficiency in the consumption
of woodfuels. These actions, together with the design of the strategy for the
management of wood resources and the increased access to alternative fuels in
rural and urban areas, would contribute to reduce the negative effects on the
environment of the necessary use of energy resources.

Long-Run Marginal Cost of Electricity
6.04      Studies to examine the long-run marginal cost of electricity and to
propose a reform of the tariff structure were done in 1985, 1988, and in
December 1989. This last study, undertaken by an independent consultant, has
been accepted by the government and the Bank.  In the absence of a decision
about the next power plant, the consultant used as a proxy the best alternative
identified in the Power Sector Master Plan, which is the Kaburantwa 16
hydroelectric plant.   For transmission and distribution the estimates were
based on the average incremental costs of the projects identified in the Master
Plan.   The calculated long-run marginal costs for medium and low-voltage
distribution are those given in Table 6.1.
Tabl. 6.1: LONG-RUN MARGINAL COST OF ELECTRICITY

p/  Capacity costs are expressed in US dollars per kw per yoar and
in FBu por kw per year.
6.05      The estimated long-run marginal costs are high due to the high cost
of new investments and the low demand for electricity.  Unit costs of new
hydroelectric power plants are comparatively high in Burundi. The size of all
possible projects is small, which does not allow for substantial economies of
scale. Also, transport costs for imported materials and equipment are high.
The lumpiness of investments relative to the low demand have as a consequence
the development of a system with a large initial excess capacity, with the
utilization rate increasing over time. In spite of the high values of the long-
run marginal costs, the government has moved to implement an electricity rate
structure based on these values.  In April 1990, medium-voltage rates were
adjusted to the estimated long-run marginal cost values, while for low-voltage
users the adjustment was phased in with an initial average increase of 20
percent (this includes 27 percent for all consumption above 375 kwh per month).
A social tariff for low-income residential users was also introduced.
Electricity rates have been partially adjusted to reflect the economic cost
of supply and the government is committed to continue these adjustments
(para. 4.08).
Distribution and Connection Program
6.06      This program will result in about 5,000 new connections.   This
represents a 37 percent increase from the number of electricity users at the
end of 1989. Most of the new users would be located close to existing electric



- 41 -
lines so that the cost of the individual connection would be low. The economic
internal rate of return was calculated on the basis of estimates of the
consumers' willingness to pay. Each household was assumed to have one kerosene
lamp that is replaced by three incandescent bulbs of 40 w after electrifi-
cation. The incremental electricity sales which are forecast to occur as a
response to the lower price of energy were estimated on the basis of recent
experience of new connections.  A linear demand curve for electricity was
assumed between present consumption of energy and the substitution level of
consumption defined above, with all incremental sales beyond that last level
of consumption valued at the existing tariff for electricity.   The costs
included in the economic analysis are the investments of the program, the
maintenance of the installations and the energy used valued at the long-run
marginal cost of electricity. Details of the economic analysis are presented
in Annex 6.1
6.07      The internal economic rate of return (IERR) is 57.4 percent.  The
high value is explained by the low level of the additional investments that are
required to obtain the full economic benefits of electrification. With this
level of investments it makes sense to connect as many new consumers as
possible. With an increase in investment costs of 20 percent, the IERR is
still quite high, decreasing only to 47.6 percent. As indicated in para. 2.04,
the obstacles to expand new connections have been the high up-front costs
charged to users and the deficiencies in organization and management. Both
problems are being addressed in the rehabilitation program of REGIDESO. A new
policy for the payments of connections, that excluded the contributions to the
extension of the grid, used low-cost materials and allowed for term payments,
has been established, and a new unit has been set up in the commercial
Department with the purpose of planning and managing new connections in the
Commercial Department.
Rural Electrification Program
6.08      The total population of Burundi is estimated to be a little over
5.3 million, but only about 6 percent is urban.   To increase the use of
electricity from the present low level of 1.5 percent of total population,
and to promote the development of rural areas, rural electrification must be
undertaken. As indicated in Chapter II, the government has pursued a policy
of building expensive micro-hydroelectric generating plants to supply
electricity to some isolated rural centers, but this approach has been costly
and not very successful. At the same time, several non-governmental
organizations and private entrepreneurs have installed diesel groups to supply
electricity to artisanal rural activities, schools, health centers and
churches. The electrification of these rural areas from the existing grid is
now an economical alternative that must be considered. Electricity from the
grid is available and the distances involved are now small due to the extension
of the electric network that has been done in the past years.
6.09      The Rural Electrification Master Plan that will be financed by the
Credit will define the future strategy for rural electrification. Among other
things, it will (i) examine the market for electricity and make projections of
demand for each rural center; (ii) study the alternatives to supply electricity
to each center and determine the optimal solution; (iii) calculate economic
internal rates of return of new projects and establish a list of priority



- 42 -
investments; (iv) examine alternatives for the technical and commercial
management of the new rural centers, including the organization of cooperatives
and other forms of participation of local communities; and (v) propose measures
to strengthen the Direction Generale de l'Hydraulique et des Energies Rurales
(DGHER). The results of the Master Plan will be available to other donors
interested in financing rural electrification projects.
6.10     At the same time, the IDA Credit will finance some specific rural
electrification projects. A consultant was hired to determine the economic
feasibility of some of the projects identified by the DGHER, using the
methodology described in Annex 6.2.  Surveys were conducted in some of the
proposed new centers and some older ones that were recently electrified to
make appropriate projections of electricity demand.  As expected, the most
attractive centers are those where non-agricultural activities are relatively
well developed. Models to measure the benefits of the substitution of kerosene
lamps, diesel groups and diesel motors used in mills and other activities by
electricity were developed. Economic benefits were measured in terms of the
substitution models, the consumers' willingness to pay, and the revenues from
the sale of electricity. Details of the socio-economic characteristics of four
centers and of the economic calculations are presented in Annexes 6.3 to 6.6.
As indicated in Table 6.2 the economic internal rates of return (EIRR) are
calculated to be between 9.5 percent and 41.9 percent.

a/ Projected consumption in year 10.
6.11     The assumptions used in the economic analysis are conservative.
The maximum rate of penetration of electricity was assumed to be 50 percent
of the existing houses built in concrete with tile roofs. No increases were
allowed for future additional houses or for new economic activities. While
three projects have acceptable economic rates of return, the financial rate
is low and even negative in some cases. This is due to the fact that most
rural consumers belong to low-income groups and will be charged the social
tariff, which is below the long-run marginal cost of electricity. Nevertheless
all the projects were chosen so as to generate revenues to cover the costs of
operation and maintenance, so that no operational subsidies are required. Once
the investments are financed by the government, the systems will be financially
self-supporting. For this purpose, the billing and collection system to be
used must be adequately defined and established. Together with the technical
and economic analysis of each project, the DGHER will submit a detailed
proposal for each new center to be electrified (para. 3.05). IDA will review
each proposal before authorizing the execution of the subprojects.

Reinforcement of the Bubanza-Bujumbura Transmission Line
6.12      The reinforcement of the 110 kv transmission line between Bubanza
and Bujumbura has been recommended as a priority investment in the Master Plan
for the Power Sector. The existing 110 kv transmission line transports the
energy from the Rwegura and Ruzizi II power plants, which represent about
65 percent of the energy used in the interconnected system of Burundi.  A
failure of this line could be compensated by additional purchases of energy
from Zaire (Ruzizi I) and by the operation of the old thermal plant of
Bujumbura, but it is estimated that between 30 percent and 40 percent of the
demand will not be satisfied.   If the failure is of a long duration, the
economic costs for the country could be substantial.
6.13      The economic benefits of the proposed project are given by the
reduction in transmission losses and by the increases in the reliability of the
electric system. The first type of benefits was estimated on the basis of load
flows and the long-run marginal cost of electricity.   There is not enough
information to estimate with some accuracy the probability, duration and cost
of a failure in the existing line, but some rough estimates were done with
available international statistics.   The economic analysis also considered
that the reinforcement of the 110 kv transmission line would be required in
any case by 1998, when a new power generating project would be developed in
the region. The execution of the reinforcement as part of the proposed Credit
only advances some investments that would be in any case required in the
future.   The details of the economic analysis are presented in Annex 6.7.
The economic internal rate of return is between 13 percent and 17 percent.
Project Risks
6.14      The physical risks associated with this project are minimal because
construction work in transmission and distribution lines is routine and would
be executed under very well-known conditions. The main risks are institutionals
(i) the government may resist further increases in energy prices; (ii) REGIDESO
may waiver in its commitment to effectively implement the rehabilitation
program; (iii) the institutional framework of the DGHER may be too weak to
manage successfully the selection, construction and operation of rural
electrification projects or the charcoal efficiency programs. The government's
recent track record with implementing difficult decisions suggests that the
risk of not taking necessary actions in energy pricing is low. Planning for
the rehabilitation of REGIDESO has been the subject of long-standing and
intensive dialogue and preparation, and REGIDESO is unlikely to go back on it
at this stage. Furthermore, several components of the proposed project aim at
strengthening the implementing agencies to further reduce the implicit risks.
Advertising campaigns for more efficient charcoal producing techniques and the
use of improved charcoal stoves will be carefully prepared and monitored in
order to achieve effective sensitization of targeted groups. The financial risk
of costs exceeding those estimated is minimal, because the scope of rural
electrification and distribution extensions can be reduced if necessary during
project execution with no detrimental effect on other parts of the project.

adjustment and rehabilitation programs designed to reestablish
REGIDESO on a sound financial basis;
Following approval in Council of Ministers,
The Government of Burundi, hereinafter referred as "the Government"
and R6gie de Production et de Distribution d'Eau et d'Electricit6, hereinafter
referred as "REGIDESO," hereby agree as follows:
CHAPTER I:  OBLIGATIONS OF REGIDESO

account of the manpower required to expand the network and increase
the number of customers.
Article 8   By December 31, 1989, submit to the Board of Directors a complete
program revising the structure of employee wages and benefits in
kind, and proceed to a thorough reclassification of both office staff
and manual laborers. The new structure should include performance
incentives linked to the performance criteria included in the
rehabilitation plan attached to the present program contract.
Article 9   Hake REGIDESO personnel at all levels aware of the difficulties
facing the enterprise and of the fact that rehabilitation is
dependent on their adherence to the objectives assigned to REGIDESO

affordable, especially to the low-income segments of the population, as well as
profitable for the enterprisa.
Article 11  Gradually reduce the volume of accounts receivable and set up a
supervisory system to monitor customer account balances on a regular
basis, and instigate an' effective policy for collecting on unpaid
bills by cutting off electricity and water service.

criterion set forth in (a) above be imposed by the Government,
REGIDESO will need to first negotiate with the Government the
amount of the resultant balancing subsidy needed to offset the
unprofitable portion and the recurrent charges resulting from
that investment or resumed project.
Article 17 Reduce the rates of network loss to 20Z for water and 102 for
electricity by the end of 1991.

minimum contribution by REGIDESO to the investment program. This
pricing policy will be established by March 1990 at the latest.
Article 25  In accordance with the principles laid down in Article 24, conduct
during the first quarter of 1990 a review of pricing based on a study
carried out jointly by the World Bank and REGIDESO (20Z medium
voltage, 15Z low voltage).
Article 26  By September 1989, restructure the composition of the Board of
Directors to ensure that members are selected for their competence
and not for their positions in the Government, to ensure that the
highest levels of expertise are represented.
Article 27  Define a policy for loan onlending rates in cooperation with the
donors, based on the recommendations of the ongoing study on the
policy of onlending in Burundi, and reflecting the nature of the
investments and their gestation period in determining loan
reimbursement policy and gr,ace periods.

*i Unit value lndox for manufactured exports (trade weighted for Burundi)
/ Exchange rate of USSi = FBu 175 at January 1990.
2.       Sales and Revenue.  Electricity consumption in Gwh is based on energy
balance as provided in para         .  Water consumption (in in) provided by
REGIDESO assumed an increase of 17 percent in 1990 as compared to 1989 figures
on the basis of the six-month figure for 1990, and 7 percent increase each year
thereafter.  Electricity and water tariffs are based on tariffs currently used
in 1990, assuming an annual increase of 8 percent in 1991, 7 percent in 1992
and 1993, and 6 percent each year thereafter.
3.       System Losses  (technical and non-technical)  for electricity are
assumed to decrease '." 20 percent in 1990 to 12 percent in year 2000 through
improved metering at i ..:Iling system and the strengthening of transmission and
distribution system.  For water, both technical and non-technical losses, the
projections assumed a decrease from 35 percent in 1990 to 25 percent in 2000,
as REGIDESO with the assistance of KFW is being implementing, beginning in
December 1989, a comprehensive program for loss reduction including proper
controls of the meters as well as the meter readers, reporting on water
consumption by center and regular billing and revenue collection for water
consumption.
4.       Other revenues are estimated to increase from 1991 at a rate of 5
percent.

B. Operating Costs
5.       Consumed goods and services are estimated for 1990 at about FBu 600
million based on six-month figures, and projected at 4 percent each year
thereafter.
6.       Other expenses and losses are assumed to remain constant from 1990
through 2000.
7.       Salaries are estimated at about FBu 535 for 1990 based on the six-
month figures for 900 staff. As REGIDESO committed itself to reduce its staff
to 800 in 1991, to 700 in 1992, and to 600 in 1993, the 1990 salaries are
proportionally and accordingly reduced assuming a 6 percent increase each year
from 1990. The 6 percent increase consists of an average of 3 percent for
performance and 3 percent as general increase for all staff as required by the
Burundian Labor Legislation.
8.       Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis at an average of
4.8 percent on average gross fixed assets in service as revalued at the end
of 1990 using a revaluation coefficient of 1,21 in 1990 and each year
thereafter. The 1.21 revaluation coefficient is based on the study on past
sub-standard investment that is expected to reduce the depreciation amount by
half after incorporation of revaluation results in the 1990 audited financial
statements.
C. Other Income Statements Items
9.       Exchange Losses.   Exchange losses are calculated and charged to
operating expenses for all new loans. With respect to outstanding foreign debt
at the end of 1989, it is assumed that the related exchange losses will not be
charged to REGIDESO's operating expenses as the revaluation surplus would be
used to absorb exchange losses resulting from the conversion of foreign debts
in FBu over the projection period, as suggested by Price Waterhouse and
authorized by internationally accepted accounting principles.  Therefore to
achieve the financial performance indicators set up through the proposed
project, exchange losses to be charged to REGIDESO's operating expenses are as
follows: FBu 1,429 million in 1996 and in 1997, and FBu 2,832 million each
year thereafter.
10.      Interest expense on all existing foreign loans as well as on new loan
in the absence of any firm commitment from the CCCE for debt forgiveness and
reschedulment is calculated, on the basis of the data on loan amounts,
repayment terms and interest rates, as provided by REGIDESO.
11.      Sinelac Charges are assumed to be FBu 264 million per annum over the
projection period based on the terms and conditions of the contract between
REGIDESO and Sinelac.
D. Balance Sheet Items
12.      Gross fixed assets in service and accumulated depreciation are
revalued in 1990 and their resulting values are incorporated into REGIDESO's
financial statements for 1990.

13.      Works in progress are based on REGIDESO's investment programs for
1990-92 and on the new loan of the proposed project which assumed a progressive
capital investment of the US$6.2 million total investment corresponding to 20
percent or US$1.24 million in 1991, 35 percent or US$2.17 million in 1992 and
1993, and 10 percent or US$0.62 million in 1994.
14.      Inventories have been estimated as a percentage of gross fixed assets
in service as follows: about 4 percent from 1990 through 1992, 4,5 percent
from 1993 to 1998, and 3,8 percent each year thereafter.
15.      Account  Receivables.    Improvements  in  REGIDESO's  billing  and
collection are assumed to reduce the accounts receivable from 8,6 months'
revenue in 1989 to 2.5 in 1990 and each year thereafter. A vigorous program
to achieve these targets is assumed to be in place including GOB's commitment
for itself, its agencies and the municipalities through appropriate budget
allocation for electricity and water combined with systematic power cuts to
delinquent private consumers as well as to others.
16.      Equity (paid in capital) represents the GOB's contribution in REGIDESO
including the balance from arrears compensation for about FBu 1.64 million.
As accumulated losses representing about FBu 9.5 billion have progressively
decapitalized REGIDESO, it is assumed on the basis of the audited financial
statements for 1989, that REGIDESO should be recapitalized for about FBu 10.4
billion to be provided partly from the use of GOB's current liabilities as
GOB's contribution to REGIDESO's equity, and partly from the reschedulement
of long term in various maturities.
17.      Long-Term Debts.  External debt outstanding as of the end of 1989 is
expressed in FBu terms using an exchange rate of FBu 175 - US$1. The terms
and conditions of outstanding debts were modelled to determine the necessary
equity increase needed to recapitalize REGIDESO.
18.      Current maturities on long-term debts reflect the portion of long-
term debt due in the next 12 months.
19.      Other current liabilities are based on the following: (a) account
payable are assumed to decrease from 10 months of cash operating expenses in
1990 to 9 and 8 months in 1991 and 1992 to 6 months from 1993 through 2000; and
(b) accrued interest is assumed to represent 5 months of annual interest
expenses.
E. Fund Flow Items

RURAL ELECTRIFICATION
Criteria for Project Acceptability
rntroduction
1.        Developing countries and donors are putting increased amounts
of resources into rural electrification but, in may cases, projeccs are
not subject to the same rigorous cost/benefit analysis that is recommend-
ed for other investment projects.   Sometimes it is confusingly argued
that rural electrification is justified on the basis of some non-quanti-
fiable social benefits.  In other cases, inflated and unrealistic tariff
revenues are considered as the only benefits. The consequence of the er-
roneous analysis is that scarce resources are wasted in investments that
are neither socially nor economically desirable and that the allocation
of the limited funds available to the country is not done correctly.
2.        This note explains how the social and economic justification of
rural electrification projects should be done following the traditional
methodology of cost/benefit analysis.   Households,  farms,  agro-indus-
tries, and commerce derive benefits from the use of electricity and these
benefits can be measured, as is customary practice in the appraisal of
development projects, by the amount of income that these families and
businesses are prepared to spend on electricity. The correctly measured
benefits should be compared with the costs of the project, calculating
the net present value and the internal economic rate of return, to deter-
mine if the project is desirable.  Rural electrification projects with
negative net present value or internal economic rates of return below the
opportunity cost of capital should no: be undertaken.
Forecasting Demand
3.        The first task in the definition of 'a rural electrification
project is to forecast demand for electricity over a reasonable period of
time. The basis for this forecast is an exhaustive survey of the popula-
tion and economic activities in the region of the projecc.  The survey
should be tailored to the area under investigation, but it should at
least idercify: (i) type and number of potential consumers; (ii) socio-
economic characteristics of consumers; (iii) physical characteristics of
houses; (iv) principal economic activities; and (v) existing and poten-
tial uses of energy.
4.        While surveys are normally undertaken in all rural electrifica-
tion projects, demand forecasts based on them are generally too optimis-
tic.   The first point to consider is that existing consumers will not
connect immediately to the electric grid.  Sometimes this is due to the
connection charges and tariff rates established by the electrical compa-
nies, but there is aLso quite a lot of social inertia in rural areas



- 82 -                          ANNEX 6.2
Page 2 of 5
which results in Low adaptation to changes.   Evidence from the rate of
connections in already executed simiLar projects should be used to make
an adequate estimate of what would happen in the new project.   Another
point to consider is that electrification per se will. not automatically
produce growth.   For this to occur other investments in the region will
have to be made. Regional development plans and budgets should be exam-
ined to forecast the growth in the number of each type of consumers, in-
cluding population and businesses, and the experience of other areas
should be used to forecast the level and growth of consumption per con-
sumer.   Street lighting and consumption of schools, health center, and
other administrative offices can be estimated directly from available
technical coefficients.
Analysis of Alternatives
5.        Rural electrification is generally considered to be the exten-
sion of the national electric grid into a new area. But areas can also
get electricity developing local sources, such as diesel-powered genera-
tors or local minihydro sites.  For small consumption and/or for remote
areas it is often cheaper to meet the electricity needs through local
supply.   In those circumstances, the capital costs of diesel generators
are normally lower than the extension of the electric grid and compensate
for the higher fuel and operating costs. This is the reason why, in the
initial phases of electrification in isolated areas, private businesses
may install their own generators and sometimes even partially supply a
neighboring town.
6.        In all rural electrification projects a comparison should be
made between the development of local supply and the extension of the na-
tional electric grid.   In a new locality it may be advantageous to in-
stall first diesel generators and then create a market for electricity.
The interconnection to the electric grid will then be done only when con-
sumption surpasses a certain minimum level. Governmental decision-makers
and donors should insist that an analysis of alternative sources of elec-
tricity supply be done before embarking on che extension of transmission
lines.
Calculation of Benefits
7.        Demand curves should be constructed for the principal types of
consumers in each project area.   These curves are based on the surveys
undertaken to forecast demand and should distinguish between:  (i) the
cost and kWh equivalency of current consumption of alternative forms of
energy being used in the area (lighting, autogeneration, diesel engines,
and other equipment to be substituted); and (ii) projected future con-
sumption of electricity at the prevailing tariff rates.   A typicical
yearly demand curve is depicted below.

In the above diagram, "CL" indicates the current level of con-
sumption (in kWh equivalent) of alternative forms of energy.  "Pi1" indi-
cates the implied price per kWh equivalent of that energy.   "C " indi-
cates the projetad Level of consumption of electricity after the proj-
ect.  "P2" indicates the prevailing tariff level charged by the company
for that consumptiou.  The area covered by rectangle "B1" represents con-
sumers' annual expenditures on (relatively expensive) alternative forms
of energy in the "without project" situation. Rectangle "B2" reoresents
the additional amount of energy the consumer is expected to use as a
result of the project (because of the fall in price) times the average
electricity tariff rate.  And triangle "B3 represents the "consumer sur-
plus", which is the difference between what consumers would be willing to
pay for each additional unit of energy consumed and what they are actual-
ly charged by the electric company. The total benefit of the project is
equal to the sum of areas "Be + B2 = B3", or
P1 x C1 + P2 (C2 - C1) + 1/2 (P1 - P2)' (C2 - C)
8.        In order to calulate "Bi", expenditures on alternative forms of
energy need to be estimated for each consumer group.   In the case of
households, commercial establishments, schools, and other administrative
offices, electricity will principally be used as a substitute for fuels
and candles currently used for illumination.  In order to calculate the
quantities involved, the numer of cesidential and other users in each
project area .must be multiplied by an estimate of the average level of
fuel and candle consumption in ncn-electrified households. An allowance
must also be made for the sutstitution of electricity in other uses
(e.g., cooking, refrigeration).   In the case of agricultural producers
and agro-business, an invenctory should be made of currently employed
diesel powered machinery (by type and capacity). Using technical coeffi-
cients and assumed utilization factors, the total substitutable consump-
tion of diesel oil can be calculated.

9.        The quantities of fueL decermined following the procedure of
the above paragraph must be mulciplied by their estimated crF cosc. This
will give the total expected economic value of savings in alcernacive
forms of energy (the area "1   in each project area.  A caveac for the
economic analysis is that in calculating the area "B', price "Pi  should
be expressed in terms of economic prices (i.e., net of taxes and subsi-
dies), whilst  ALculating the area of "B3', price "Pr" should reflect ac-
tual market costs (including taxes and subsidies) because it defines the
slope of che demand curve (and hence the area "B3").
10.       The area "B2" is determined by the average price of electricity
to rural consumers (price "P " in the diagram) and the increase in con-
sumption of energy ("C " t   "c?j") due to the fall in price (from ("P1" to
P2").  The level of ?P2" is generally a known data axd the calculation
of energy consumption in the "without project" ("C1") has been described
in para. 8 above.   Energy consumption "with the project" ("C2") can be
estimated from data on average level of electricity consumption by type
of consumers in recently electrified areas.  In the case of residential
consumers, average consumption should be broken down by size and type of
dwellings.  It must be noted that in the first years of electrification
only a fraction of the potential consumers connect to the electric sys-
tem.   Also, energy consumption per household increases rapidly in the
first year after connection as electric lights and priority appliances
are purchased, and then declines reaching close to saturation levels near
the fourth year.  These facts should be considered in the escimation of
electric consumption with the project.
tl.      The area "B ", representing the value of the "consumer sur-
plus", is calculated ty multiplying the increase in energy consumption
due to the project ("C " - "C1') by the fall in the price of energy ("PI,
- "P 21', times one-halL  In this case, however, subsidies and taxes have
been included in the cost of alternative forms of energy, since they re-
present part of the consumer's perceived cost in the "without project"
situation.  "Pi" was thus obtained by dividing the total consumer expen-
diture on aLternative forms of energy before the project by the assumed
initial energy consumption level "C1'.
12.       Practical experience indicated that benefits of energy substi-
tution (area "B11") and of consumer surplus (area "B3") are generalLy more
than 60Z of the total benefits of a rural electrification project. When
these benefits are not measured there is a huge under-estimation of bene-
fits.  Decisions based excLusively on tariff revenues will not justify
most rural eleceri!'ication projects and therefore consultants over-esti-
mate demand to approach some acceptable internal economic rate of return.
Project Acceptability
13.      Once demand and benefits have been estimated, it is necesssary
to compare the time-stream of costs and benefits over the useful life of
the project on a present worth basis.   The calculation of nee present
values and internal economic rates of return follow customary practices



- 85 -                           ANNEX 6.2
Page 5 of 5
of cost/benefit analysis.  Shadow-price adjustments for foreign exchange
and unskilled labor should be made on the basis of the country's macro-
economic situation.
14.       A rural electrification project should be executed only if the
internal economic rate of return is greater than the opportunity cost of
capital.  When this is not the case, the contribution of electricity to
raise income is limited and does not compensate for the resources used.
Sometimes this may be due to the high cost of the project.   In those
cases, network layout and equipment capacity should be re-examined to
find out if savings in investment costs are possible. But the low econo-
mic returns may also indicate that local economic activity is very small
and that other investments are needed to develop the area.  If this is
the case, rural electrification should be postponed until the additional
infrastructure is in place.  The economic rate of return calculated ac-
cording to sound cost/benefit analysis provides a clear signal of the
adequacy of the proposed investment.

.Fuel consumption: 6,000 liters per year
4. Services:

- Health center (40 beds)
- Church and parochial center
=     5. New Projects:
- Expansion of the school (12 new rooms)
- Houses for teachers (4)
- Students' residence
B.    Consumption of Electricity
2.    It is assumed that the first year after the center is electrified 30S
of the houses built with bricks/tiles are connected, which is a total of 52.
Unit consumption is assumed to be 30.5 kwh par month for normal residences
and 61 kwh per month for those residences that have a restaurant. Therefore,
residential consumption would be 20,130 kwh the first year. The maximum
penetration rate of electrification is 50S of all the houses presently built
with bricks and the speed of electrification is 302 of the houses to be
electrified. There are no future increases in unit consumption or in the
number of houses. Residential consumption reaches 32,574 kwh in year 10.
3.    The diesel power groups that at the present time supply the school,
the church and the artisanal activities connected to them are replaced by
electricity from the grid and there is an increase in present consumption of
these users of 202. The diesel mill is replaced by an electric motor with

ANNEX 6.3
Page 2 of 4
an estimated consumption of 20,000 kwh per year.  Public lights consisting
of 20 points of 80w are installed and the community and health centers are
electrified. The projected consumption of electricity in Mugara is as
follows:
Year                 Consumption

1_
2                         81,562
3                         85,222
4                         87,784
5                         89,614
6                         91,078
7                         92,176
8                         92,908
9                         93,274
10                         93,640
11-30                        94,006
Costs
4.    Investment costs for 6.0 km of medium-voltage lines and 4.0 km of low
voltage lines, including 20 public lights, were estimated at 22,744,885 FBu
at January 1990 prices, excluding taxes and import duties. Annual
operations and maintenance is estimated at 531,580 FBu.
C.    Economic Benefits
5.    Substitution benefits are obtained from the replacement of petroleum
lamps used for residential lights, from the displacement of the diesel power
groups and from the replacement of the diesel motor of the mill by an
electric motor. It is assumed that each household has one petroleum lamp
(type Otempfte*) which is replaced by three electric bulbs of 40 w. Total
energy substituted the first year is estimated at 42,163 kwh, of which 276
kwh are derived from petroleum lamps, 25,183 kwh from the diesel power
groups and 16,704 kwh from the mill.
6.    The benefits for residential households have been calculated on the
basis of the consumers'willingness to pay. They include the value of the
substitution of petroleum lamps (FBu 5,035 per household), the purchases of
electricity at the existing tariffs and the value of the surplus that the
consumer receives because of the reduced price of energy (FBul22,467 per
household). A similar calculation has been made for the users of diesel
groups, while for the replacement of the motor of diesel mills the only
benefit is given by the substitution of the source of energy. Other
benefits include public lighting, the investments avoided by the consumers
(replacement of petroleum petroleum lamps) and payments made for

connections, inside installations and equipment. Details of the
calculations are presented in the report of the mission of Mr. Ivan
Bergeron, rural electrification consultant. The detailed flow of costs and
benefits is presented in Table 1
D.    Results
7.    The estimated internal economic rate of return (IERR) is 41.9Z.  This
rate is decreased to 35.0Z with a 20? increase in investment costs, and to
27.2Z with a decrease in the maximum penetration rate of electricity to 30Z
of all houses built in concrete. On the other hand, it increases to 54.6?
if the electrification proceeds more rapidly, with a yearly speed of
electrification equal to 50Z of the houses that remain to be electrified.
The use of a shadow exchange rate 15 percent higher than the market rate
decreases the IERR to 37.1 percent.

D.   Consumption of Electricity
4.        It is assumed that the first year after the centers are
electrified, 30? of the houses built with bricks are connected, which is a
total of 73. Unit consumption is assumed to be 30.5 kwh per month for
normal residences and 61 kwh per month for those residences that have a
restaurant. Therefore, residential consumption would be 30,110 kwh the
first year. The maximum penetration rate of electrification is 502 of all
the houses presently built with bricks and the speed of electrification is
30Z of the houses to be electrified. There are no increases in unit
consumption or in the number of houses to be electrified. Residential
consumption reaches 48,312 kwh in year 10.
5.        The diesel power groups that supply the schools, churches and
missions and the related artisanal activities are replaced by electricity
from the grid the first year and there is an increase in present
consumption from these users of 202. The diesel mill of Giheta is replaced
by an electric motor with an estimate consumption of 15,000 kwh per year.
Public lights consisting of 30 points of 80 w in Giheta, 10 points in
Ribimba and 10 points in Rutegama are installed. The health centers,
administrative offices and shops are also electrified.

11-30                         253,078
E.    Costs
6.          Investment costs for 24 km of medium-voltage lines and 2.5 km
of low-voltage lines, including 50 public lights, were estimated at
49.873.552 FDU at January 1990 prices, excluding taxes and import duties.
Annual operations and maintenance is estimated at 1.244.710 FBU.
F.    Economic Benefits
7.          Substitution benefits are obtained from the replacement of
petroleum lamps used for residential lights, from the displacement of the
diesel power groups and solar panels and from the replacement of the diesel
motors at the two mills by electric motors. It is assumed that each
household has one petroleum lamp (type ItempAte") which is replaced by 3
electric bulbs of 40 w. Total energy substituted the first year is
'estimated at 107,108 kwh, of which 373 kwh are derived from petroleum
lamps, 99,402 kwh from the diesel power groups and 7,333 kwh from the mill.
8.          The benefits for residential housebolds have been calculated on
the basis of the consumers' willingness to pay. They include the value of
the substitution of petroleum lamps (FBu5,035 per household), the purchases
of electricity at the existing tarifs and the value of the surplus that the
consumer receives because of the reduced price of energy (FBu122,467 per
household). A similar calculation has been made for the users of diesel
groups, while for the replacement of the motor of diesel mills the only
benefit is given by the substitution of the source of energy. Other
benefits include public lighting, the investments avoided by the consumers
(replacement of petroleum lamps) and the payments made for connections,
inside installations and equipment. Details of the calculations are
presented in the report of the mission of Mr. Ivan Bergeron, rural
electrification consultant. The detailed flow of costs and benefits is
presented in Table 1.

G.    Results
9.         The estimated internal economic rate of return (IERR) is 31.82.
This rate is decreased to 26.4Z with a 20Z increase in investment costs and
to 22.0 with a decrease in the maximum penetration rate of electricity to
30% of all houses built with bricks. On the other hand, it increases to
38.6% if the electrification proceeds more rapidly, with a yearly speed of
electrification equal to 50% of the houses that remain to be electrified.
The use of a shadow exchange rate 15 percent higher than the market rate
decreases the IERR to 28.0 percent

B.    Consumption of Electricity
2.    It is assumed that the first year after the center is electrified 30Z
of the houses built with bricks/tiles are connected, which is a total of 52.
Unit consumption is assumed to be 30.5 kwh par month for normal residences
and 61 kwh per month for those residences that have a restaurant. Therefore,
residential consumption would be 5,856 kwh the first year. The maximum
penetration rate of electrification is 501 of all the houses presently built
with bricks and the speed of electrification is 301 of the houses to be
electrified. There are no future increases in unit consumption or in the
number of houses. Residential consumption reaches 8,784 kwh in year 10.
3.    The diesel power groups that at the present time supply the school,
the church, the cold chamber and the development project in Ruvumvu, are

Costs
5.    Investment costs for 13.0 km of medium-voltage lines and 3.0 km of
low voltage lines, including 20 public lights, were estimated at 30,917,603
FBu at January 1990 prices, excluding taxes and import duties. Annual
operations and maintenance is estimated at 745,560 FBu.
C.    Economic Benefits
6.    Substitution benefits are obtained from the replacement of petroleum
lamps used for residential lights, from the displacement of the diesel power
groups and from the replacement of the diesel motors of the mills by
electric motors. It is assumed that each household has one petroleum lamp
(type tempOte") which is replaced by three electric bulbs of 40 w. Total
energy substituted the first year is estimated at 36,179 kwh, of which
66 kwh are derived from petroleum lamps, 26,513 kwh from the diesel power
groups and 9,600 kwh from the mill.
7.    The benefits for residential households have been calculated on the
basis of the consumers'willingness to pay. They include the value of the
substitution of petroleum lamps (FBu 5,035 per household), the purchases of
electricity at the existing tariffs and the value of the surplus that the
consumer receives because of the reduced price of energy (FBul22,467 per
household). A similar calculation has been made for the users of diesel
groups, while for the replacement of the motor of diesel mills the only
benefit is given by the substitution of the source of energy. Other
benefits include public lighting, the investments avoided by the consumers

(replacement of petroleum lamps) and payments made for connections, inside
installations and equipment. Details of the calculations are presented in
the report of the mission of Hr. Ivan Bergeron, consultant. The detailed
flow of costs and benefits is presented in Table 1
D.    Results
8.    The estimated internal economic rate of return (IERR) is 9.5 percent.
This rate is decreased to 7.1 percent with a 20 percent increase in
investment costs, and to 5.5 percent with a decrease in the maximum
penetration rate of electricity to 30 percent of all houses built in
concrete. On the other hand, it increases to 10.8 percent if the
electrification proceeds more rapidly, with a yearly speed of
electrification equal to 50 percent of the houses that remain to be
electrified. The use of a shadow exchange rate 15 percent higher than the
market rate decreases the lERR to 7.6 parcent.

Tribunal
B.    Consumption of Electricity
2.    It is assumed that the first year after the center is electrified 30Z
of the houses built with bricks/tiles are connected, which is a total of 5.
Unit consumption is assumed to be 30.5 kwh par month for normal residences
and 61 kwh per month for those residences that have a restaurant. Therefore,
residential consumption would be 2,562 kwh the first year. The maximum
penetration rate of electrification is 5OZ of all the houses presently built
with bricks and the speed of electrification is 301 of the houses to be
electrified. There are no future increases in unit consumption or in the
number of houses. Residential consumption reaches 3,294 kwh in year 10.
3.    The diesel power groups that at the present time supply the school,
the church and the artisanal activities connected to them are replaced by
electricity from the grid and there is an increase in present consumption of
these users of 201. The diesel mill is replaced by an electric motor with
an estimated consumption of 7,500 kwh per year. Public lights consisting of
10 points of 80w are installed and the community and health centers are
electrified. The projected consumption of electricity is as follows:

11-30                        21,038
Costs
4.    Investment costs for 1.0 km of medium-voltage lines and 1.0 km of low
voltage lines, including 10 public lights, were estimated at 8,895,557 PBu
at January 1990 prices, excluding taxes and import duties. Annual
operations and maintenance is estimated at 242,600 FBu.
C.    Economic Benefits
5.    Substitution benefits are obtained from the replacement of petroleum
lamps used for residential lights, from the displacement of the diesel power
groups and from the replacement of the diesel motor of the mill by an
electric motor. It is assumed that each household has one petroleum lamp
(type "tempfte") which is replaced by three electric bulbs of 40 w. Total
energy substituted the first year is estimated at 11,191 kwh, of which
41 kwh are derived from petroleum lamps, 3,650 kwh from the diesel power
groups and 7,500 kwh from the mill.
6.    The benefits for residential households have been calculated on the
basis of the consumers'willingness to pay. They include the value of the
substitution of petroleum lamps (FBu 5,035 per household), the purchases of
electricity at the existing tariffs and the value of the surplus that the
consumer receives because of the reduced price of energy (FBul22,467 per
household). A similar calculation has been made for the users of diesel
groups, while for the replacement of the motor of diesel mills the only
benefit is given by the substitution of the source of energy. Other
benefits include public   lighting, the investments avoided by the consumers
(replacement of petroleum petroleum lamps) and payments made for

connections, inside installations and equipment. Details of the
calculations are presented in the report of the mission of Mr. Ivan
Bergeron, consultant. The detailed flow of costs and benefits is presented
in Table 1.
D.    Results
7.    The estimated internal economic rate of return (IERR) is 26.5.  This
rate is decreased to 21.9? with a 20? increase in investment costs, and to
18.4Z with a decrease in the maximum penetration rate of electricity to 30Z
of all houses built in concrete. On the other hand, it increases to 32.6?
if the electrification proceeds more rapidly, with a yearly speed of
electrification equal to 502 of the houses that remain to be electrified.
The use of a shadow exchange rate 15 percent higher than the market rate
decreases the IERR to 23.3 percent.

BURUNDI
ENERGY SECTOR REHABILITATION PROJECT
Economic Analysis of the Reinforcement of the Transmission Line
Between Bubanza and Bujumbura
Basis of the Analysis
1.    The existing 110 kv transmission line between Bubanza and Bujumbura
has been designed to transport up to about 30 Mw. At the present time and
in normal circumstances, it would transport 26.0 Mv l/ (8.9 Mv from Ruzizi
II and 18.0 Mv from Rwegura). When the third unit of Ruzizi II is
installed, it would normally transport 31.3 Mw. Therefore, a reinforcement
of the transmission line will only be needed when a new project is developed
in the region (Kaburantwa, Kagunizi, Masango, Rushiha or Ruzizi III). In
accordance with the results of the energy balances and the EDF Master Plan,
it is assumed that this new project should be operational by 1998. The
doubling now of the transmission line advances investments that would have
to be made in any case in the future.
2.    The construction of a new transmission line between Bubanza and
Bujumbura will reduce transmission losses and increase the reliability of
the system. On the basis of the load flows calculated by Electricite de
France International (Plan Directeur National d'Electrification, Rapport
Particulier No.5, December 1988), it has been estimated that the reduction
in losses with a new 110 kv transmission line would be approximately 1,140
Mwh per year.
3.    In 1989 about 65 percent of the energy needed in the interconnected
system of Burundi passed through the existing transmission line between
Bubanza and Bujumbura. A failure of this line would be compensated in part
by buying additional energy from Zaire which uses the 70 kv transmission
line between Ruzizi I - Bujumbura, but it has been estimated that between 30
percent and 40 percent of the needs would not be supplied. The shortages of
electricity will have as a consequence that several industries will have to
stop operations during the period of the failure, while others will have to
use their emergency diesel groups if available. If the failure had a long
duration, the economic costs for the country could be substantial. However,
there is not enough information to estimate with some accuracy the
probability and the duration of the failures.
4.    The flow of costs and benefits of the reinforcement of the
transmission line is presented in Table 1.
1/   This amount could increase if Burundi purchases more than one
third of the power of Ruzizi II.



- 104 -
Annex 6.7
Page 2 of 3
Results
5.    The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the case without
measuring the benefits of increases in reliability is 10.1 percent. Since
these increases in reliability are t-, main benefit of the reinforcement of
the transmission line, it can be concluded that the project is economically
advantageous and should be undertaken.
6.    On the basis of international statistics on 110 kv transmission lines
of similar length it is estimated that the maintenance of the line could
need an interruption of the line of three days every two years. Important
failures which could need 15 days of interruption could happen once every
100 years, while small failures of between two and six hours could be
estimated at 1.5 per year. With these values and for the energy transported
through the line (130 Gwh), probable losses have been estimated at 1,322 Mwh
per year. However, the engineers of REGIDESO think that the probabilities in
Burundi are higher because the stealing of angle-irons from the transmission
pylons are very common in the area. In the 70 kv transmission line between
Ruzizi I and Bujumbura there have been seven important incidents in the last
10 years with interruptions lasting from 16 days to 3 months.
7.    If the failures avoided with the doubling of the transmission line
amount to 500 Mwh per year and are valued only at the marginal cost of
electricity, the rate of return increases to 12.7 percent. If the failures
amount to 1,000 Mwh per year, the rate of return would be 15.0 percent. If
the failures amount to 1,500 Mwh per year, the rate would be 17.0 percent.
