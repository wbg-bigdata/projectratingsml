1. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      Ecuador has large reserves of hydrocarbons, significant hydro-
electric resources and potential geothermal reservoirs. Hydrocarbons and
hydroelectric energy are currently commercially exploited, while forests
and vegetable wastes (charcoal and sugarcane bagasse) are the main non-
commercial sources of energy.
Energy Demand and Supply
1.02      Total output of primary energy has been adequate to meet domestic
requirements and has provided ample exportable surpluses of crude oil. The
table below illustrates the 1978 structure of primary energy output.

1.03      Between 1969 and 1978, commercial energy consumption 1/increased
at an average annual rate of about 11%, from 872,000 TOE in 1969 to 2,220,000
TOE in 1978 and yearly energy consumption per capita doubled, from 0.15 TOE
in 1969 to 0.29 TOE in 1978. In 1978, commercial energy consumption by sectors
was as follows: transportation and fishing, about 60%; commerce and households,
23%; and industry, about 17%. About 97% of the total final commercial consump-
tion was from hydrocarbon derivatives and 3% from hydroelectricity.
Hydroelectric Resources
1.04      The hydroelectric potential is estimated to be 22,000 MW, mainly
contained in the Pastaza, Santiago and Napo basins. If fully developed, the
firm energy would be about 90,000 GWh/year (which if thermally generated would
require more than 150 million barrels of oil per year). It is presently esti-
mated that about 12,000 MW could be economically developed (based on prevailing
international fuel prices). At present, only about 2% of this potential has
been realized. The 1980-84 Development Plan has set as an objective the
intensified development of hydroelectric resources, and by 1985 it is estimated
that 72% of electricity requirements will be provided by this source, as
compared with about 25% at present.
Hydrocarbons and other Fossil Fuels
1.05      Sedimentary basins extend over an area of 17 million ha.  In the
seventies only limited new reserves were found, and the level of proven
reserves decreased from about 1.6 billion barrels in 1972 to about 1.0 billion
barrels in 1980.  Addition to proven reserves thus is of the highest priority.
The national development plan forecasts a 730-million-barrel increase in
reserves over the 1980-84 period, 570 million from secondary recovery and
160 million from new fields.  Current oil production amounts to about 220,000
barrels/day, which covers all of the country's requirements, estimated at
about 75,000 barrels/day, and leaves a substantial balance for export.
1.06      Associated natural gas at the different oil fields is not available
for power generation purposes. Currently, some gas is reinjected into the
reservoirs to maintain field production conditions and the remainder is flared.
By 1982, the gas now flared is to be processed at a new liquefaction plant
(under construction at Shushufindi) and will be used for domestic consumption
at major centers. The Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana (CEPE) is
presently evaluating the off-shore reserves at the gulf of Guayaquil. Con-
siderable amounts of natural gas are expected to be available from this site.
The Master Plan Studies (para. 3.04) will look into the use of gas for
electricity generation purposes.

Non-Conventional Sources of Energy
1.07      Ecuador has favorable prospects for geothermal development.  Super-
ficial prospection surveys have detected geothermal activities in Tungurahua,
Pichincha and Azuay. The Ecuadorean Electrification Institute (INECEL),
the Borrower of the proposed loan, has undertaken the responsibility for
evaluating the geothermal potential and in the first stage, presently in
execution, has received technical assistance from the Latin American Energy
Organization (OLADE). A preliminary report, which includes the results of
these prospects, is currently under preparation.
1.08      In rural areas, fuel-wood is an important source of energy.
The country has important forestry resources, mainly in the Amazonas region
and in the province of Esmeraldas. However, the lack of a reforestation
policy and the indiscriminate use of wood for industrial and energy purposes
has reduced considerably the forest area, and rural areas are facing
shortages of fuel-wood. The National Energy Institute (INE) is attempting to
address the problem through the development of improved wood-fueled cooking
stoves.
1.09      The possible use of solar energy, windpower, and other non-
conventional sources is being studied by INE. In addition, OLADE is promoting
the construction of biodigestors, in which animal and vegetable waste is
converted into methane. A demonstration plant has been built jointly with the
Provincial Council of Pichincha and OLADE is also providing technical assis-
tance to other provinces for similar purposes.
Energy Sector Organization
1.10      National economic planning is performed by the National Development
Council (CONADE), which has prepared a National Development Plan for 1980-84.
This plan, mandatory for public sector institutions, is intended to help ensure
the coherence in investment programs in all areas of the economy. It is to be
reviewed each year.
1.11      The Ministry of Natural and Energy Resources (MRNE) is the executing
and controlling agency for national energy policy. Under its jurisdiction
are INECEL, CEPE (a public sector corporation through which the Government
participates in the petroleum industry 1/), and INE, a research institute
created in 1978 which is presently assessing Ecuador's energy resources,
developing energy balances, and evaluating alternative energy technologies.
1.12      The present organization is satisfactory and results in a reasonable
level of decentralization of decision making, while also generally ensuring the
coordination of the policies implemented by the respective executing agencies.
However, there are some problems. MRNE is relatively poorly staffed and has
experienced high personnel turnover, and CEPE has faced both organizational
1/   Several foreign oil companies also operate in Ecuador, in exploration,
production and refining. The Government has recently developed new
contractual formulas which are expected to attract increased foreign
participation in exploration activities.

strains as well as conflicts of authority with MRNE and of coordination
with other agencies. This situation has been improving recently, and the
problems discussed are not expected to affect the proposed project.
Fuel Prices
1.13      Until early 1981, the prices of petroleum products in Ecuador were
among the lowest in the world. In 1980 the implicit subsidy to consumers,
given by the difference between internal and world market prices, represented
an amount estimated to be close to 8% of GDP.
1.14      In the 1980-84 National Development Plan, the Government explicitly
stated that it would adjust the prices of hydrocarbons, and some increases
(for jet fuel and for fuel oil for ships) were approved in early 1980.
Subsequently, a new "high test" gasoline was introduced at a price of
US$0.73 per gallon (regular gasoline was then selling at US$0.19 per gallon)
and in early 1981 the price of all petroleum products was increased, in some
cases, such as regular gasoline, by over 200%. Present retail prices approxi-
mately average 55%-60% of the wholesale prices in the Caribbean.
1.15      The retail prices of fuels used for electricity generation (mainly
Bunker C and diesel) had in 1980 been at level which was 13% to 16% of the
world market, and this represented a hidden subsidy to power consumers that
exceeded US$100 million a year (roughly equivalent to the value of sector
billings). These prices have now also been increased, and currently repre-
sent 36% to 42% of prevailing world market levels. Agreement was reached
that these prices will be periodically increased so that in 1984 they
represent not less than 50% of the world level then prevailing.
1.16      At present the prices for fuels used for electricity generation are
sufficiently high to ensure that there is no waste, and that hydro generation
is fully utilized while auto-generation is discouraged.
Power Sector Organization
1.17      Ecuador's 1961 Electricity Law establishes that the Government,
through INECEL, has the monopoly on electricity generation, transmission and
distribution, but is empowered to authorize private operations. At present
there is only one privately owned company: the Electric Company of Ecuador,
Inc. (EMELEC), which operates in Guayaquil under a municipal concession.
The contract expires in 1985, after which time the municipality of Guayaquil
may -- by first giving appropriate advance notice -- purchase at a fair
price the company's facilities. The other 14 power companies are organized
as private corporations, with INECEL as the largest shareholder and the
balance of shares owned mainly by the local municipalities. In a few cases,
there are also individual private shareholders, who own very small participa-
tions. Thus, whether in use of its regulatory powers (para. 1.19) or as a
majority stockholder, INECEL has the ability to substantially control the
activities of all the power companies in the country.   Annex 1, Table 1.1,
shows INECEL's participation in the capital of each power company. In addition
to these companies, INECEL also directly operates two small power systems and
42 municipalities operate small local power installations.



- 5 -
1.18      The organization described above represents a considerable improve-
ment over that which prevailed in 1961, when more than 100 companies were
in operation. INECEL plans to continue the process of merging and consoli-
dating the local power systems, by forming regional companies. This develop-
ment is highly desirable as most of the power companies presently face signifi-
cant diseconomies of scale. INECEL's present goal is to consolidate all
electric services now being provided by the 14 power companies it controls in
10 regional companies. At negotiations, agreement was reached that this will
be done by December 31, 1984.
Power Sector Regulation
1.19      The Ministry of Natural and Energy Resources is responsible for the
formulation of national electrification policy, while INECEL is responsible
for power sector regulation and supervision. All power companies are required
to submit their capital budgets to INECEL, inform INECEL about external bor-
rowing plans, allow INECEL to inspect their facilities and audit their
records, and abide by the regulations INECEL's Board approves. INECEL's
regulatory performance is discussed in paragraphs 2.04 through 2.06.
Existing Facilities
1.20      Ecuador's installed power generating capacity (December 1979) is
about 924 MW, of which 700 MW, or 76% of the total, is thermal capacity; the
balance is hydroelectric.  About 520 MW, or 56% of the total installed
capacity, are currently interconnected through the 230 kV Quito-Guayaquil
transmission line and the 69/34.5/22 kV Quito-Latacunga-Riobamba-Ambato
subtransmission network. Present public service supply (through INECEL, its
subsidiaries, EMELEC and municipalities), accounts for about 84% of total
power supply. Private generation (self-producers, mostly industrial and
agricultural undertakings) accounts for the remaining 16% (about 153 MW
capacity, of which 141 MW are diesel generators and 12 MW are hydroelectric
plants). A summary description of these installations is shown in the

Bank Group Participation in the Power Sector
1.21      The Electric Company of Quito (EEQ) has been the main recipient
of Bank Group funds within Ecuador's power sector. The first two Bank opera-
tions (in 1956 and 1957) helped to finance the 40-MW Cumbaya hydroelectric
project, several diesel plants, and extensions of the distribution systems
(these works were completed by the end of 1961 and have been operating satis-
factorily).
1.22      IDA Credit 286-EC for US$6.8 million was approved in 1972 and
covered part of the foreign exchange costs of the 30-MW Nayon hydroplant,
*an 18-MW diesel power station, transmission lines, and rural electrification.
The PPAR (No. 3003, issued in May 1980) concluded that:
(a)  the physical objectives of the project were met, albeit with
delays and cost overruns;
(b)  progress towards the institutional objectives of the project
was disappointing;
(c)  most of the covenants related to the financial aspects of the
institution were not met; and
(d)  lack of cooperation adversely affected the effectiveness of IDA
supervision efforts, which, however, would also have required more
frequent field supervision than actually took place.
These lessons were kept in mind when outlining the conditions for the proposed
project, even though the proposed borrower is a different entity.
1.23      The only other financing provided by the Bank to the sector has been
through Loan S-006-EC to FONAPRE, for the Master Plan studies and the
feasibility study of the Paute-Mazar hydro-development which are currently
under way (para. 4.01).
Electricity Tariffs
1.24      The regulations governing electricity tariffs were approved by
decree in 1975 and are based on sound financial criteria. Essentially, they
give INECEL the power to set tariffs at a level that allows electric power
companies to recover costs and make a reasonable profit, so that they may
enjoy a satisfactory financial situation and provide service efficiently.
1.25      To achieve this objective, the regulations authorize electric
power companies to achieve a rate of return of 8.5% on a rate base defined
as the replacement cost, net of depreciation, of fixed assets in operation
plus estimated working capital needs. Annual rate of return surpluses (or
deficits) over the 8.5% figure are to be registered in a stabilization account
and if surpluses or deficits occur in three consecutive years, tariffs should
be revised.



- 7 -
1.26      The regulations also establish a system of tariff adjustments due
to cost variations. Automatic adjustments are made when unit labor costs,
unit electricity purchase costs, or unit fuel costs vary between 5% and 10%
over the level used to determine the existing tariff levels. When the unit
costs mentioned above vary by more than 10%, adjustment must be approved by
INECEL's Board.
1.27      For political reasons, the regulations were never implemented,
which accounts for the financial difficulties faced by the sector (paragraphs
5.01 to 5.04). None of the electric power companies revalued its assets in
the manner prescribed, nor were tariffs periodically adjusted in the manner
required to achieve the 8.5% rate of return. In this respect, it should be
noted that INECEL's Board is controlled by the Government. Subsequent to
the fuel price increases implemented in early 1981 (para. 1.13), INECEL's
Board approved a policy of monthly tariff increases averaging 3%. At
negotiations, agreement was reached that these increases will remain in
force until the agreed rate of return targets are achieved. Failure to
implement these increases as agreed would be an event of default. Before
the loan is declared effective, the Bank will seek confirmation that INECEL
is fulfilling its tariff increase commitments.
1.28      The tariff levels and tariff structures of the 15 companies in
the sector vary considerably. In 1979, the average sector tariff was US$
mills 44/kWh; however, four systems (including the large EMELEC system and the
Latacunga system, directly operated by INECEL) had average tariffs below
US$ mills 40/kWh and, in one of these (Riobamba), the average tariff was
US$ mills 28/kWh. In contrast, six systems had average tariffs exceeding
US$ mills 56/k.wh.  The national development plan for 1980-84 sets as a policy
goal the attainment of a uniform tariff structure for the national interconnected
system, and the 1980 tariff structure changes (para. 1.30) are a modest step
in this direction.
1.29      It should be noted that, with the present sector organization, the
achievement of a national tariff structure will be a difficult goal to reach.
This is because the cost structures of the different power companies differ
considerably; while some companies like EEQ and EMELEC operate in predominantly
urban areas, where population is heavily concentrated and industry has a
significant weight, others operate over larger territories, where popula-
tion is dispersed, average income is low, and industrial demand is not signifi-
cant. Thus, a mechanism would be required to transfer funds between companies
so as to allow them all to meet financing requirements and rate of return
targets. At negotiations, agreement was reached with INECEL that it will
submit to the Bank, not later than September 30, 1981, a specific proposal
(including main operational characteristics and target dates for implementation)
for implementing this mechanism; discuss it with the Bank, and put it into
operation.



-8-
1.30      The tariff structure prevailing through 1979 encouraged electricity
use by establishing an inverse relationship between demand level and unit
prices. In 1980 this was changed and, for the residential sector, there
are now lower rates for demands below 70 kWh per month and higher (constant)
rates when consumption exceeds this figure. Furthermore, rates for
residential demands of 70 kWh per month or less are to remain unchanged for
a period of three years, as part of the Government's incomes policy. In view
of its social objectives, this is justified; however, both the cut-off level
of 70 kWh and the rate level should be reviewed when tariff structures are
revised (para. 1.32). For commercial and industrial users, the rate structure
still favors the larger consumers. This, too, should be reviewed once the
marginal cost studies are completed.
1.31      The above analysis and the financing problems faced by the power
sector (discussed in Chapter 5) indicate that strong action in the tariff
field is required. Such action involves: (a) significantly increasing
average tariff levels (para. 5.03), (b) further changing tariff structures
so as to bring them in line with true economic costs (para. 1.32), and
(c) reducing the present tariff disparities between the various electric
power companies (paragraphs 1.28 and 1.29).
Marginal Cost Studies
1.32      As part of the Master Plan studies, INECEL's consultants' will
prepare an analysis of the marginal cost of electricity generation. At
negotiations, agreement was reached that INECEL would furnish to the Bank,
no later than October 31, 1982, the results of the study, together with
INECEL's own comments and proposals for a comprehensive marginal cost study,
which will enable it to revise its structure of retail rates for the sale
of electricity and would provide grounds for a review of the financial rate
of return requirement, if and when future projects are brought for Bank
consideration.
Constraints on Sector Development
1.33      The Government has set ambitious goals for the power sector, aiming
to substantially replace thermal generation and simultaneously significantly
increase access to service. These goals are reflected in the 1982-85 consoli-
dated investment program for INECEL and its subsidiaries (para. 5.13), which
results in total financing requirements of about US$1.8 billion. The success-
ful implementation of this program requires a major funding effort, which
includes tariff increases, large amounts of Government equity contributions
and sizeable external borrowings. Failure to perform as required in any of
these areas will, in all likelihood, result in program implementation delays.
In view of the political difficulties associated with increasing tariffs and
of the budgetary problems faced by the Government, the risk of such delays
should not be underestimated.
1.34      While, as indicated above, the financial issues are presently the
most serious ones faced by the sector, other matters of pressing concern are
the continuance of fuel subsidies, which distort resource allocation inducing
excessive consumption and waste, and the relatively weak control hitherto
exercised by INECEL over the activities of the other power companies, which
;s evidenced in poor coordination and in inefficiency. The remedies for these
issues involve, in the last instance, difficult political decisions, and, to
rtho extent that these are not implemented, present problems will continue.



1.35      To minimize the above risks, the Government and the Bank have been
engaged in a prolonged dialogue, which resulted in the implementation of
some significant measures (paragraphs 1.14 and 1.27) thus minimizing the
difficulties of meeting the loan covenants, once the loan becomes effective.
2. THE BORROWER
Organization and Management
2.01      The Borrower of the proposed loan would be INECEL, an autonomous
entity of the Government of Ecuador. INECEL was founded in 1961 and is
responsible for assessing national power resources, planning power sector
expansion, constructing and operating generation and transmission facilities,
supervising the other companies in the power sector, and approving tariffs
for the sale of electricity. INECEL also owns a major participation in 14 of
Ecuador's 15 electric public utilities and directly operates two small local
systems.
2.02      INECEL is governed by a Board of Directors presided by the Minister
of Natural Resources and Energy. Other board members are the Minister of
Finance, the Minister of Industry, the representative of the President of
CONADE, the Chief of the Joint Command of the Armed Forces, and one represen-
tative from each of the following: the other power companies, the Association
of Electrical Engineers, and the power sector workers. Responsibility for day
to day operations is delegated to the General Manager, who is assisted by six
operating managers.
2.03      INECEL's organization chart is shown in Annex 2, Table 2.1.  Although
the organization structure is basically reasonable, INECEL faces management
problems. Some of these are caused by lack of qualified staff, notably in
finance, others by inadequate coordination between the various departments,
which operate with a considerable degree of autonomy. Furthermore, the number
of operating and staff units directly reporting to the General Manager is
high, probably placing excessive demands on his time and on his ability to
supervise them adequately. To address these problems, and also to assist
INECEL in the upgrading of its information systems, evaluation of data process-
ing requirements and conciliation of budgetary and accounting data, the
proposed loan would finance consultant services for an organization study and
formulation of a program of institutional improvements. Draft terms of
reference for this study have already been agreed upon. At negotiations,
agreement was reached with INECEL that it will engage the consultants no later
than December 31, 1981, will discuss the recommendations of the study with the
Bank, and will implement such recommendations as have been mutually agreed upon.
Supervision of Electric Power Companies
2.04       Through its Marketing and Distribution Department, INECEL supervises
the operations of the electric power companies. The Department's main func-
tions involve setting up standards for works and supervising the technical
aspects of the companies' operations and maintenance as well as their manag-
erial performance. These activities require seeing that norms instituted by
INECEL are properly applied and that the work of INECEL's representatives at
the subsidiaries' Boards of Directors is properly coordinated.



- 10 -
2.05      Though the Electricity Law vests sector regulatory powers in INECEL
(para. 1.19), in practice INECEL's subsidiaries have tended to operate with a
large degree of autonomy. Furthermore, despite the fact that INECEL holds the
voting power majority in each of the subsidiaries' Boards, it has seldom made
its presence felt; on the other hand, the minority Board members, which
represent the municipalities in which the subsidiaries operate, have carried a
disproportionate weight in decision making, often introducing political con-
siderations. This may help to explain some of the management problems which
many of these subsidiaries face and which INECEL has had limited success in
solving.
2.06      Currently, INECEL's management is striving to shape up its super-
visory role. New staff have been appointed to key positions, meetings have
been held with the subsidiaries' managers, and minimum periodic information
requirements have been set up. The organizational and institutional improve-
ments study included in the proposed project, would also look into INECEL's
supervisory performance and provide recommendations for its improvement.
However, since this study will require a long time to complete 1/, at nego-
tiations agreement was reached with INECEL that it would submit to the Bank,
an interim program--to be implemented at the earliest and monitored during
project supervision--which would include the upgrading of periodic reporting
by the subsidiaries, mechanisms for more frequent contact between INECEL's
management and those of its subsidiaries, closer evaluation and control of
the subsidiaries' capital budgets, and assignment of increased responsi-
bilities to INECEL's directors at the subsidaries' boards. That a satis-
factory program had been submitted would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
Staffing
2.07       At present, INECEL employs about 2,400 people, 500 of whom have
professional degrees (nearly 400 of these are engineers, mainly civil and
electrical engineers) and has forecast that it will employ about 3,500
people by 1985, which implies an annual growth rate of 8%. INECEL's subsid-
iaries employ an additional 3,700 people, and this number would increase at
approximately the same rate as INECEL's own staff. It would presently appear
that, both in INECEL and in the subsidiaries, there are areas that are over-
staffed. For this reason, the performance indicators which were agreed upon
at negotiations, reflect a slower pace of growth in employment than INECEL's
present forecasts. Furthermore, it has been agreed with INECEL that the
organizational and institutional improvements study will address this issue and
identify the specific areas that have an excess of personnel so that corrective
action may be taken.
2.08       The salaries of INECEL's administrative staff are tied to the
public administration structure. Workers are affiliated with several craft
unions, each of which bargains separately, and the labor contracts usually run
1/   The first phase of the consultants' work would comprise an evaluation
of INECEL's policy making role and control activities and information
flows from the subsidiaries. This phase would take about 18 months to
be completed.



- 11 -
for about two years. Labor relations are generally good and labor disputes
not frequent. Salary levels, supplemented by abundant fringe benefits, are
adequate and generally competitive with those offered by the private sector.
Salary increases are a function of merit and of seniority.
Training
2.09       INECEL has established an important and active Training Department
which has, over the past seven years, developed a good, if somewhat central-
ized, training system. Training services (oriented mainly to technicians and
workers in the operational and maintenance areas of the utilities) are avail-
able to, and are widely used by, the staff of INECEL and of its subsidiaries.
The training system is based upon sound principles and benefits from executive
management commitment and support. The following features of the system are
indicative of the manner in which training services have been developed and
are now being routinely provided.
(a) INECEL operates a well established residential training center
(French-Ecuatorian National Center, CENAFE, with a present capa-
city of 100 trainees), with competent staff and adequate facilities;
(b) an annual policy statement on workforce and training is updated
and circulated each year;
(c) regular workforce planning and forecasting for the complete sector
is undertaken as a corporate management exercise; and
(d) an annual program is issued to all regional utilities, detailing
the training programs to be offered at CENAFE and approved programs
of education and training available in Ecuador and externally (for
which grants are available).
2.10      The successful implementation of the sector development program
and of the managerial and administrative reforms expected to be proposed by
the organization and institutional improvements study will require an intensive
training effort, which should also include management training. To this
end, INECEL and the Bank have agreed to include as part of the proposed
project a training component, which would comprise an in-depth evaluation of
INECEL's training programs (to be carried out by external consultants whose
qualifications and terms of reference are satisfactory to the Bank); specific
training programs recommended by the consultants and agreed to by INECEL and
the Bank; and training equipment. The draft terms of reference for these
consultants have already been agreed with the Bank.  At negotiations agreement
was reached that these consultants will be hired no later than December 31,
1981.
Procurement
2.11      INECEL's procurement procedures are governed by a national procure-
ment law. The law's provisions have been found to be, by and large, reasonable
though restrictive interpretations sometimes cause excessive delays. To prevent
problems in this area, agreement on the contents of the bidding documents for
the purchase of equipment and materials for the project has already been reached



- 12 -
and the draft documents have been submitted for review by the Bank, and
found satisfactory. During negotiations it was also agreed that the
Government of Ecuador will take such actions as may be required to expedite
procurement authorizations and clearances as to avoid implementation delays.
Accounting
2.12      The quality of INECEL's financial statements is extremely poor be-
cause of the lack of importance hitherto attached to such information,
department head changes, old fashioned recording systems and absence of
competent staff. Contributing factors too, have been the insufficient attention
given to internal auditing and the delays of the Contraloria General's external
auditing interventions, which have limited their usefulness. INECEL is trying
to address this issue, and in 1980 it engaged additional qualified staff for its
internal auditing unit, which is progressively increasing the scope of the
work it carries out. The training programs proposed (para. 2.10) are expected
to address the needs of the internal auditing unit.
2.13      The main problems of INECEL's accounting systems and policies are:
(a) INECEL does not prepare consolidated financial statements, even
though its participation in each of the subsidiaries' capital stock
ranges from 54% to 99%. This participation is shown as an invest-
ments, at historic cost.  Profits (or losses) earned by the subsid-
iaries are not recognized, unless collected through dividends; and
(b) Fixed assets are shown at cost, despite legal provisions which
require their annual revaluation.
Other problems arise from the poor quality of some of the figures and from
the excessive time taken to produce reports.
2.14      To address these problems, at negotiations agreement was reached
with INECEL that it will:
(a) implement measures so that it may submit fully consolidated
financial statements for 1983, and on interim consolidation
targets for 1981 and 1982;
(b) revalue its fixed assets annually, and engage qualified experts, not
later than December 31, 1981, on terms of reference acceptable to the
Bank, to design recording systems such that future fixed asset inven-
tories would be up to date and to fully inventory its fixed assets
and assess their replacement value, and (promptly upon the receipt of
the valuation report) to reflect such valuation in its records and
financial statements; and
(c) reflect a provisional revaluation 1/ of fixed assets in operation
on the basis of inflation indices in the 1980 financial statements.
1/   Until replacement values have been assessed and agreed with the Bank.



- 13 -
2.15      Since the consolidation of financial statements requires that
INECEL's subsidiaries submit in time financial statements of satisfactory
quality (which at present most cannot do), at negotiations agreement was
reached with INECEL that it will furnish to the Bank its programs to achieve
this goal in each subsidiary, as per an agreed schedule. The programs should
identify the accounting problems faced by each subsidiary, and should propose
specific measures to address them. Furthermore, since the asset valuation
problem (para. 2.13) is also applicable to INECEL's subsidiaries, at
negotiations agreement was reached that INECEL will cause each of its sub-
sidiaries to revalue its fixed assets in the same manner as INECEL, per an
agreed timetable, and would assist them and supervise them in this exercise.
2.16      The organization and institutional improvements study is to also
address the operating problems of the accounting area, particularly data
processing and staffing.
Auditing
2.17      INECEL's financial statements are presently audited by the
Contraloria General de la Nacion, a specialized government agency. Due to the
Contraloria's lack of staff, the issuance of the audited statements has been
frequently, and seriously, delayed. For instance, the 1978 and 1979 audited
statements only became available in January 1981. Furthermore, the scope of
the audit does not meet Bank requirements. It has therefore been agreed with
INECEL that it will engage private external auditors. At negotiations, it
was also agreed that calls for bids would have been issued, and bids evaluated,
as a condition of loan effectiveness and that actual engagement would take
place not later than March 31, 1982.
2.18      INECEL's subsidiaries are organized as private corporations.  Only
one, EEQ, has private external auditors. The others are supposed to be
audited by the Contraloria, but this only happens in a limited number of
cases. Since, as indicated earlier, most of the subsidiaries have significant
problem's in their accounting systems, it is imperative that a major improvement
effort be made, if consolidated financial statements are to be produced.
Thus, in addition to the measures listed in para. 2.15, at negotiations it was
agreed that INECEL will cause each of its subsidiaries to engage independent
external auditors, by agreed dates.
Insurance
2.19      INECEL follows the practice of externally insuring its assets against
major risks, such as fire, explosion, hurricanes, tornadoes and flooding.
As far as feasible, the insurance policies are based on estimated replacement
values. These practices are acceptable and consistent with Bank requirements.
At negotiations, agreement was reached to include the standard insurance clause
in the loan agreement for the proposed project. Over the past 12 months,
INECEL has set up an insurance division and this is already resulting in
substantial economies in insurance costs, which previously were too high.



- 14 -
Dam Safety
2.20      INECEL is currently completing construction of the Paute-Amaluza
dam (one of the highest arch dams in the world). The successful operation of
the facilities included in the proposed Bank project would be closely linked
to the adequate operation of the Paute hydroelectric development (para 4.07
and Annex 4, Attachment 4.2). It has therefore been agreed with INECEL that
the Paute-Amaluza dam will be monitored and inspected at least once a year
by qualified and experienced experts and that a copy of the inspection report
would be submited to the Bank.
3.   THE POWER MARKET
The Present Power Market
3.01       During the period 1970-78 Ecuador substantially improved
its electrification level as shown by the indicators below:
Year     Capacity installed/          Consumption/       Electrification
inhabitant            inhabitant              Rate (%)
1970            51 watts              155 kWh/year              28
1975            74 watts              266 kWh/year              32
1978           122 watts              333 kWh/year              38
Despite this favorable trend, per capita installed capacity, energy consumption
and access to electricity are among the lowest in South America. 1/
3.02      Ecuador's electric public utilities (INECEL, its subsidiaries,
EMELEC, and 42 small municipal systems) currently supply electricity to about
622,000 customers, representing about 3,200,000 inhabitants. In 1978, total
electricity sales amounted to 2,182 GWh, of which about 43% were sold to the
Guayaquil area by EMELEC and about 29% to the Quito area by Empresa Electrica
de Quito, while INECEL's other subsidiaries and municipalities accounted for
the remaining 26.5% and 1.5% respectively.
3.03       Total electricity sales in Ecuador have increased steadily at an
average annual rate of over 13%, from 791 GWh in 1970 to 2,182 GWh in 1978 (see
Annex 3, Table 3.1). Simultaneously, maximum demand has increased from 224 MW
in 1970 to 565 MW in 1978 (see Annex 3, Table 3.2), at an annual average rate
of about 12%. Ecuador's 1978 total electricity generation and sales were as
follows:
1/   Consumption per capita and electrification rates of some other South
American countries are respectively:  krgertina, 1,236 kWh and 800%; Brazii,
912 kWh and 62%; Chile, 927 kWh and 87%; Colombia, 621 kWh and 62%; Peru,
523 kWh and 35%; and Uruguay, 1087 kWh and 80%.

The Future Power Market
3.04      INFCFL, with the assistance of consultants (Lahmayer - Germany and
-idroservice - Brazil), is currently preparing the National Electrification
Master Plan Studies, with Bank financing through Loan S-006-EC (para. 1.23).
One of the main objectives of these studies has been the assessment of the
future power market. The load forecast recently completed was developed
after an evaluation of alternative projection methodologies: extrapolation
of historical consumption trends, correlation with macro-economic indicators
and regionalized and national forecasts by sectors. Based on a detailed
analysis of the results obtained by using these different methods, INECEL, in
consultation with the Bank, decided to adopt the national load forecast by
sectors.
3.05      Ecuador's total electric energy requirements, including transmission
and distribution losses, are expected to increase from 2,574 GCh in 1978 to
5,600 GWh in 1985 at an average annual growth rate of about 11.7%. 1/ Maximum
demand is expected to increase from 565 MW in 1978 to 1,232 MW in 1985 at an
average annual growth rate of about 11%. The generation system load factor
(non-coincidental peak demand) is expected to improve from 50.5% in 1978 to
51.87 in 1985. Details of the energy and power demand forecasts are given in
Annex 3, Tables 3.1 and 3.2.
1/   This growth is in line with Ecuador's economic projections, as out-
lined in a Bank's country study of July 1979 (Ecuador: Development
Problems and Prospects), and with the macroeconomic forecasts contained
in the national five year development plan.

3.06      Specific components of projected 1985 aggregate demand and load
growth rates are as follows:
Category                        GWh                 1978-85 Growth Rate (%)
Domestic                       1,757                           12.1
Commercial                       691                            8.6
Industrial                     2,071                          13.3
Public Lighting and Others       403                           8.6
Total Sales               4,922                          12.3
Transmission and Distri-
bution Losses                 677                           8.1
Total Generation          5,599                          11.7
3.07      The structure of electricity consumption is not expected to change
considerably during the period 1978-85; the share of industrial consumption
is expected to increase from 34% in 1978 to 37% in 1985, and losses and power
station use are expected to decrease by 3% from 15% in 1978 to 12% in 1985.
It is reasonable to expect such reduction in energy losses and power station
use as: (i) the bulk of the energy will be transferred through- high voltage
lines (230 kV and 138 kV); (ii) existing subtransmission and distribution
systems are expected to be improved; (iii) INECEL and its subsidiaries are
expected to improve the existing methods of energy monitoring and theft
control (para. 3.11); (iv) power station use at thermal plants (which accounts
for the bulk of this item) is expected to be reduced substantially, as the
National Interconnected System's thermal generation requirements will decrease
once the Paute hydro-development becomes operational (para. 4.07). The
remaining categories are expected to remain basically unchanged. The following
table illustrates the structure of electricity consumption by categories:
Category                            % of Total Generation
1978       1985
Residential                             30.8        31.4
Commercial                              11.7        12.3
Industrial                              33.5        37.0
Public Lighting  and Others              8.8         7.2
Losses and Power Station Use            15.2        12.1
Total                             100.0       100.0
3.08      The analysis carried-out by INECEL and its consultants to determine
the sales forecast was comprehensive, and reflects well substantiated trends.
The results were reviewed by the Bank and found adequate. The forecasts
are consistent with: (i) the probable effect on the consumption pattern



- 17 -
of the proposed tariff increases (para. 5.03); (ii) the considerable
reduction of electricity generation by auto-producers due to the increase
of internal fuel prices (para. 1.15); and (iii) the expected increase in
the numbers of consumers.
Energy and Capacity Balances
3.09      Based on the market requirements, existing power availability,
and the future power development program, system simulation studies were
conducted for yearly power and energy allocations during dry (critical) and
average precipitation year conditions. Results of these simulations are shown
in Annex 3, Tables 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.
3.10      The simulation studies were used to: (a) determine the commissioning
dates of new power plant additions (a new power plant was added to the system
when a deficit in peaking capability and/or energy supply occurred; each power
plant was pre-selected based on optimization studies, and the generation
program was determined using economic criteria and international fuel prices);
(b) evaluate probable yearly generation from individual power plants; and
(c) derive adequate margins of generation reserves (varying from 20% in 1983
to 5% in 1986, according to system operational characteristics). The selected
(least-cost) 1980-1995 expansion program consists only of hydroelectric power
schemes. The analysis carried out to define the energy and power balances was
comprehensive and based on adequate hypotheses; the premises, assumptions and
results of these studies are satisfactory.
Distribution Losses
3.11      In 1978, INECEL's subsidiaries' distribution losses (including theft
and unaccounted) amounted to nearly 200 GWh, representing about 15% of the
utilities' gross generation plus energy purchases. Some subsidiaries have
reached unacceptable loss levels (up to 35% in the case of the Latacunga
and Azogues utilities), mainly due to inadequacies of their distribution
systems and deficiencies of their recording methods. Information on losses by
company is given in Annex 3,Table 3.6. During negotiations agreement was
reached with INECEL that it will: (a) engage consultants no later than
December 31, 1981 (under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank) to carry
out a study to improve the overall efficiency of the subsidiaries' distribution
systems (including review and standardization of current distribution planning,
construction and operational practices, improvement of existing distribution
systems, and measures to reduce theft); (b) discuss the conclusions and recom-
mendations of the consultants with the Bank; and (c) implement such recommenda-
tions as have been agreed upon with the Bank, per an agreed timetable.

4.   PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Background
4.01      INECEL, with the assistance of consultants financed by Loan
S-006-EC (para. 1.23), is currently preparing a National Electrification
Master Plan, designed to: (a) assess Ecuador's future power market;
(b) select the least-cost program for power generation expansion based on
hydroelectric, geothermal and conventional thermal developments; (c) optimize
transmission and distribution systems expansion; and (d) formulate the
investment programs required to execute and implement the foregoing works.
4.02      The Master Plan studies are being developed in three stages: short-
term (1978-85), medium-term (1985-92) and long-term (1992-2000). The
following studies are also included under the Master Plan: (a) inventory of
Ecuador's hydroelectric 1/ and geothermal 2/ resources, which will collect
existing information and will create new information banks containing carto-
graphic, hydrological and geological data, as well as information regarding
the development stages of hydroelectric sites (identification, evaluation,
prefeasibility, feasibility and detail design studies); and (b) development
of an Integrated Planning System which will optimize the hydro/geothermal
power plants (identified in the inventory of hydro/geothermal resources) and
their installation sequence.
4.03       The short-term (1978-85) Master Plan studies have already been
completed and the draft reports were found to be adequate.  The medium-term
and long-term Master Plan studies are currently progressing satisfactorily
and draft reports are expected to be available from December 1981 to February
1982.
Construction Program
4.04      The main objectives of INECEL's construction program are to:
(a) meet the different regional systems' power requirements through the
addition of new generating capacity; (b) integrate all of INECEL's subsidiaries
and some municipal systems to the National Interconnected System (SNI) through
a new 230/138 kV transmission network in order to achieve fuel economies and
increase efficiency; and (c) provide electricity to an additional 1,500,000
inhabitants (about 250,000 new customers) through the construction of new sub-
transmission and distribution systems. The proposed Bank project would
contribute to the achievement of these objectives by: (a) delivering the
2
1/   The inventory is expected to cover about 225,000 km , or about 70% of
Ecuador's surface area, and about 80% of Ecuador's estimated hydro-
electric potential. Only hydroelectric schemes larger than 30 MW are
to be included.
2/   The inventory of geothermal resources, originally to be financed by
the Bank, is now being financed through a grant from OLADE.



- 19 -
hydroelectricity to be generated by the existing and proposed hydropower plants
to the different load centers; (b) incorporating the different isolated systems
to the SNI network; and (c) improving INECEL's management and staff skills through
comprehensive training programs and assistance from consultants.
4.05        In order to meet energy and power capacity requirements during the
period 1980-90, INECEL and its subsidiaries have prepared generation, trans-
mission and distribution 1/ construction programs which are based on detailed
analyses of the capability of existing generation and transmission facilities
and of facilities being added to the existing system and on the results of the
short-term Master Plan optimization studies.
4.06       The construction program includes the following major works:
(a) about 940 MW and 1,220 MW of new generating capacity to be installed
during 1980-85 and 1986-90 respectively; (b) about 860 and 775 circuit-
kilometers of 230 kV and 138 kV transmission lines to be commissioned during
1980-82 and 1983-86 respectively; and (c) expansion of subtransmission
and distribution systems. Details of capacities and commissioning dates
for the different construction program works are given in Annex 4, Attachment
4.1.
Generation Expansion Program
4.07      Currently, INECEL is constructing the following generating facilities,
which are part of its 1980-85 expansion program:
(a) Paute (Phase A and B) hydroelectric power plant, which is expected
to be commissioned during 1982 (2 x 100 MW) and 1983 (3 x 100 MW);
(b) Esmeraldas thermal plant, consisting of I x 125 MW residual
fuel-based steam turbine plant, to be commissioned during 1981;
(c) Guayaquil No.3 (73 MW) oil fired steam generator and Quito (60 MW)
gas turbines, to be commissioned during 1981; and
(d) About 180 MW of small gas turbines and diesel engine generators,
to be installed by the different INECEL subsidiaries during the
period 1980-82 while the interconnected system becomes operational.
Details of these works are provided in Annex 4, Attachment 4.2.
4.08       To meet estimated energy requirements through 1990 and to partially
substitute for thermal generation, INECEL prepared a generation expansion
program which includes the installation of the following hydroelectric power
plants: Agoyan (150 MW), to be operational by 1986; extension of the Paute
hydro development (500 MW), to be completed by 1987; the Daule-Peripa multipur-
pose development (130 MW), to be commissioned by 1988; the Paute-Mazar (140 MW)
1/   The 1986-90 transmission, subtransmission and distribution work programs
have not yet been defined and are not expected to be until February 1982,
when the results of the medium-term Master Plan will become available.



- 20 -
hydro development, to be commissioned by 1989; and the Toachi (300 MW) hydro-
electric plant, to be commissioned by 1990. The characteristics of these
plants are given in Annex 4, Attachment 4.2.
Transmission Expansion Program
4.09       The existing transmission system is reduced to short links between
major consumption centers and the nearby power generating stations. The first
National Interconnected System major link was commissioned during August
1980 and ties the two biggest consumption centers, Guayaquil and Quito,
through a 654 circuit km - 230 kV transmission line. The following trans-
mission lines, part of the 1980-85 expansion program, are currently under
construction and are expected to be commissioned before the end of 1982:
(a) 366 circuit km - 230 kV, Guayaquil-Paute; (b) 80 circuit km - 138 kV
Quito-Ibarra; (c) 308 circuit km - 138 kV, Santo Domingo-Esmeraldas, and
(d) 107 circuit km - 138 kV, Quevedo-Puertoviejo. Details of the National
Interconnected System are shown in Annex 4, Attachment 4.3 and in the map.
Furthermore, during the period 1982-85 INECEL would install and commission
about 338 circuit kms of 230 kV transmission lines, 427 circuit kms of 138 kV
transmission lines and about 280 MVA step-up/down transformation capacity at
different substations (proposed transmission project to be financed by the
Bank).
Subtransmission and Distribution Expansion Programs
4.10      The majority of the isolated systems (all of INECEL's subsidiaries)
would be integrated to the main SNI network through subtransmission lines (69
kV and 34.5 kV). About 1,300 circuit kms of 69 kV and 34.5 kV subtransmission
lines and about 450 MVA step-up/down transformation capacity at different
substations are to be installed and commissioned during the period 1982-85.
4.11      Since successful completion of the subtransmission component affects
the economics of the overall power development program and of the proposed
project, appropriate measures regarding work supervision and technical assistance
are required. INECEL has already submitted to the Bank a revised 1981-85
subtransmission program, which defines which lines it would erect itself
and which would be erected by its subsidiaries and provides updated cost
estimates, bidding and implementation schedules and defines the financing
arrangements proposed. During negotiations agreement was reached that INECEL
will assume full responsibility for the adequate supervision and timely
commissioning of the subtransmission works and will submit periodic reports
to the Bank on the progress of these works.
4.12      During the period 1982-85, INECEL and its subsidiaries aim to provide
electricity to about 1,500,000 additional inhabitants in different areas of
Ecuador (this represents about 250,000 new electricity consumer services).
This would increase Ecuador's electrification rate from 38% in 1978 to 50% in
1985. For this purpose, INECEL's subsidiaries plan to construct new low
voltage distribution circuits and extend and improve existing distribution
systems. INECEL also plans to implement a two-stage rural electrification
program with assistance from IDB for the first stage. The projected electrifi-
cation rate (13% for the period 1982-1985) is somewhat higher than historical
trends (11.5% for the period 1972-1978), but INECEL and its subsidiaries have
the manpower and equipment capabilities to achieve the proposed target.



- 21 -
Sector Investment Requirements
4.13      INECEL has prepared a 1980-85 power sector investment program,
which is in line with CONADE's five-year national development plan.
The investment requirements for this period (see Annex 4, Table 4.2) are
estimated at US$1,636 million, at 1980 price levels. About US$1,377 million
are to be invested by INECEL in: (a) SNI generation plants (US$782 million)
(b) 138 kV and 230 kV SNI transmission lines (US$304 million); (c) 69 kV
and 34.5 SNI subtransmission lines and rural electrification (US$164 million);
and (d) studies and general investments (US$127 million). In addition,
EMELEC and INECEL's subsidiaries are expected to invest about US$259 million
in their distribution systems. A summary of the investment program is given
in the following table:

The Project
4.14      The project proposed for Bank financing would consist of 230 kV and
138 kV transmission lines and corresponding conversion (step-down) substations.
It would also include training and institutional development programs, engineer-
ing services for the design of a National Dispatch Center and engineering ser-
vices for the supervision of the execution of the transmission/substation works.



- 22 -
4.15      Issuance of bidding documents for the purchase of equipment and
materials is expected to start by January 1982 and construction by January
1983. The physical works included in the project are expected to be completed
by December 1984 and the studies by June 30, 1985.
4.16      The physical works and consulting services included in the proposed
project are described below (see Annex 4, Attachment 4.3 and map):
(a) Transmission Lines
(i)  Construction of about 338 circuit km of 230 kV transmission
lines: (a) from the Paute hydroelectric plant to Totoras
(near Ambato); and (b) from Milagro to Machala; and
(ii)  Construction of about 427 circuit km of 138 kV transmission
lines: (a) from Guayaquil to Santa Elena; (b) from Cuenca to
Loja; (c) from Ibarra to Tulcan; and (d) from Totoras to Ambato.
(b) Substations
Construction of substations and installation of step-down trans-
formers at Machala (60 MVA), Riobamba (60 MVA), Santa Elena (40 MVA),
Posorja (20 MVA), Tulcan (60 MVA) and Loja (40 MVA); and extension
of Ibarra substation.
(c) Training Program
Consultants' services for reviewing the existing training program and
training facilities of INECEL and its subsidiaries; and costs of
specific training programs, additional training facilities, purchase
of laboratory and training equipment, and scholarships for technical
and administrative staff.
(d) Institutional Development Program

Project Cost Estimates
4.17      Project cost is estimated at US$144 million, of which US$86 million
is the foreign exchange component. The project cost was estimated by INECEL's
planning and construction staff and reviewed and updated by the Bank. The
cost estimate is based on recent prices for equipment and materials and on
costs for installation and construction obtained from contracts recently



- 23 -
awarded by INECEL (230 kV Paute-Guayaquil and 138 kV Esmeraldas-Santo Domingo
transmission lines) and from works recently commissioned (230 kV Guayaquil-
Quito transmission line). The estimate is considered reasonable.
4.18      The project costs, which are detailed in Annex 4, Table 4.3, are
summarized in the following table:

1/   Includes Training Program (US$2.0 million), Institutional Development
Program (US$3.1 million) and Load Dispatch Center design (US$1.6 million).
Import duties are not included in these estimates as INECEL is exempt from
these levies.
4.19      The project cost estimates are based on prices prevailing in
January 1980, escalated to reflect January 1981 price levels. Physical
contingencies were calculated at a rate of 10% of direct costs on all
project components. In view of the nature of the works involved, the
figure is reasonable. Price contingencies were calculated using the
following annual escalation rates applied to basic costs and physical
contingencies:

Foreign Products and Services                  9       8.5       7.5
Project Financing Scheme
4.20      The financing scheme for the project would be as follows:
(a) local costs, amounting to US$57.9 million, would be financed from
INECEL's net internal cash generation and from Government contri-
butions;
(b) foreign exchange costs which amount to US$86.2 million, including
indirect foreign exchange costs, and US$13.8 of financial charges
would be financed by the proposed US$100 million Bank loan; and
(c) the balance of financial charges, amounting to US$11.2 million,
would be financed from internally generated funds.
Engineering and Consultants' Services
4.21      INECEL's engineering staff is preparing the designs and specifications
for equipment, materials and construction works, assisted when necessary by
specialized consultants (IECO-USA and individual consultants who are currently
under contract with INECEL). The same staff is also preparing the bidding
documents for all project items.
4.22      INECEL will engage consultants under terms of reference and
contractual conditions acceptable to the Bank for the following tasks.
(a) training program, for which a total of 36 consulting staff-months
were estimated to be required, at an average cost of US$12,000
per staff-month 1/;
(b) institutional development program, expected to require about 126
consulting staff-months at an average cost of US$12,000 per
staff-month 1/;
(c) load dispatch center, expected to require about 82 engineering
staff-months at an average cost of US$12,400 per staff-month 1/;
and
(d) supervision of project construction during the period June 1982-
December 1984, which is expected to require about 80 consultant
staff-months at an average cost of US$5,000 per staff-month 1/.

Procurement and Disbursements
4.23      Most contracts for the supply of equipment and materials and their
installation (including civil works) to be financed with funds from the
proposed loan will be procured through international competitive bidding
(ICB) procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines. Competitive bidding
in accordance with other procedures satisfactory to the Bank, such as interna-
tional shopping, will be appropriate for a few contracts (such as laboratory
and training equipment, vehicles and computer software and hardware), each not
exceeding US$100,000 and estimated not to exceed US$1,000,000 in total. Most
of the equipment and materials to be procured for the transmission lines and
substations will be imported, as the local manufacturers either do not have
the production capability to meet the quantities required (aluminum conductors)
or do not produce the specialized equipment and materials required for the
project. Therefore, preference for bid evaluation purposes to local manufac-
turers and suppliers has not been requested by the Government.
4.24      The loan would be disbursed over a five-year period (see Annex 4,
Table 4.4) against (a) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported goods and 85%
of the local expenditures for locally manufactured materials; (b) 14% of the
total expenditures on the contracts for civil works and for the installation
of the corresponding equipment and materials, representing the estimated in-
direct foreign exchange costs of the goods to be provided by the contractors
(construction materials, transport, machinery, equipment, furniture);
(c) consulting services and related expenses as follows: 100% of foreign
expenditures for supervision of project construction, 95% of total costs for
training program, 70% of total costs for the institutional development program
and load dispatch center studies; and (d) interest and other charges during
construction on the Bank loan through mid-1984 up to US$13.8 million. All
requests for disbursements of funds from the loan account would be fully
documented. Retroactive financing for up to US$1,000,000 is proposed for
payment of consultants' fees incurred and paid by the Borrower after June 1,
1981 to cover advanced expenditures directly related to the training and
institutional development programs and the design of the load dispatch
center. The closing date for the proposed loan would be December 31, 1985.
Project Execution
4.25      INECEL will engage contractors for the civil works and for the
installation of the equipment and materials of the transmission lines and
corresponding substations through international competitive bidding (ICB)
in accordance with Bank guidelines. It is expected that these contracts would
be awarded to foreign firms with ample experience in similar undertakings.
Invitations to bid are expected to be issued by January 1982 (see Annex 4,
Attachment 4.4 for complete implementation schedule).
4.26      INECEL's engineering staff, with the assistance of consultants
whose experience, terms-of-reference and conditions of employment are accept-
able to the Bank (and who will be responsible for the overall supervision of
the construction) would be capable of executing the project adequately, as
demonstrated by the successful completion of the Quito-Guayaquil transmission
line, which was commissioned on schedule in August 1980. During negotiations
agreement was reached with INECEL that these consultants will be engaged by
September 30, 1982.



- 26 -
4.27      Project execution will be monitored against target dates shown
in the project implementation schedule (Annex 4, Attachment 4.4). INECEL's
operational, financial and managerial performance will be monitored through
performance indicators which were agreed during negotiations (Annex 4,
Table 4.5). During negotiations agreement was reached that INECEL will
submit such indicators regularly to the Bank.
Environmental Aspects
4.28      The proposed project does not present major environmental problems.
Transmission line routes are considerably distant from urban centers.
Furthermore, substations would be located at urban centers with due regard
to environmental and aesthetic considerations and in accordance with
urban regulations. INECEL would compensate property owners as required by the
national legislation. Clearing of rights-of-way would be kept to a minimum
and natural drainage patterns are not expected to be affected.
Project Risks
4.29      The project faces no special physical risks.  Sector issues or
insufficient action on financial matters could, however, negatively affect
institutional performance or result in program and project delays (paragraphs
1.33 to 1.35 and 5.02 to 5.04).
5. FINANCE
Introduction
5.01      Over the past 15 years, electricity sales have increased at an
annual rate exceeding 12% (see Annex 3, table 3.1, for the sales statistics
since 1970), thus requiring significant investments in power facilities.
Despite this, INECEL has followed a policy of low electricity tariffs,
placing a substantial financing burden on the Government.
5.02      In the next five years, investment requirements are expected to be
even larger than in the preceding years, so that by 1985 total fixed assets
will approximately double their present value in real terms. To accomplish
this, a major financing effort will be needed. This will put to a severe test
the intentions of the Government and of INECEL to simultaneously reduce fuel
subsidies significantly, raise electricity tariffs to adequate levels, and
progressively reduce the sector's dependence on Government contributions.
5.03      To meet the consolidated financing requirements of INECEL and of its
subsidiaries, average retail electricity tariffs (inclusive of fuel clause)
will have to increase from an equivalent of about US$0.05/kWh in 1980 to
US$0.154/kWh in 1985. This implies a nominal increase of about 200%; however,
after adjusting for estimated domestic inflation the real increase would be
about 50%. To achieve this, INECEL has put into effect a policy of monthly
tariff increases averaging 3% and has agreed to maintain these increases until
the covenanted rates of return have been attained. This policy is expected to



- 27 -
result in a December 1981 retail tariff (inclusive of fuel clause) of S/1.74/kWh,
which represents an increase of 32% over the December 1980 level. At negotia-
tions, it was also agreed that cost increases in excess of those forecast
would be automatically reflected in additional tariff adjustments through the
implementation of existing legislation (para. 1.26).
5.04      At negotiations, the Government agreed to assign nearly US$900 million
equivalent (nearly 70% of which are expected from INECEL's participation in
oil royalties) to the power sector between 1981 and 1985. Assurances were
also obtained that any shortfall in oil royalties would be made up through
other Government equity contributions. If such support were not to materialize,
the financial viability of the investment program would disappear.
5.05       Annex 5, tables 5-1 through 5.8, show INECEL's historic and forecast
consolidated financial statements and complementary financial information.
Since INECEL does not presently prepare consolidated financial statements,
such consolidation was done by the appraisal mission. Analogously, fixed
assets which had not been hitherto revalued (despite legal provisions which so
require) were revalued, on an estimative basis, by the appraisal mission (see
Table 5.2, footnote b). For these reasons, and also because the original
statements were not audited (paragraphs 2.17 and 2.18) the historic statements
should be viewed as estimates. The mission forecasts are expressed in current
dollars (internal prices were assumed to increase at an annual rate of 15% and
external prices at 9%; fuel price assumptions are discussed in Table 5.1,
footnote f). A constant exchange rate of S/. 25 = US$1 was assumed.
Financial History
5.06       Though INECEL was legally constituted in 1961, in its early years
its scope of activity was very limited and mainly concentrated in planning
sector development and promoting the regional integration of the small local
systems. In 1973, INECEL commenced to invest in generating plants and its
first installations were commissioned in 1976. Investment in a major genera-
tion project, Paute (500 MW), started in 1975 and only built up in recent
years.
5.07      Thus, INECEL's financial history is, for all relevant purposes, very
short and provides little guidance as to its prospects for the future. Some
salient factors may, however, be noted:
(a) Net internal cash generation has been negative and financing needs
(which were not only caused by INECEL's own expansion but also by
the requirements posed by INECEL's subsidiaries) were mainly fi-
nanced through Government contributions (of which the main source
was INECEL's participation in oil royalties) and external loans.
(b) INECEL's debt-equity structure has evolved within conservative
bounds, keeping well below a 50:50 ratio (based on fully revalued
financial statements, as estimated by the Bank mission), thus
suggesting that increased reliance on long-term indebtness is
viable, provided revenues are increased to ensure adequate debt
service coverage.



- 28 -
5.08      Though the above comments pertain only to INECEL, they are also
applicable to the consolidated financial performance of INECEL and its sub-
sidiaries. The estimated consolidated rate of return on fully revalued assets
was negative in 1978 and 1979 and only marginally positive, 2.6% in 1980,
despite the sizeable fuel subsidies. It should be noted too that, except for
EEQ, the subsidiaries have tended to rely on INECEL for financing, generally
limiting their external borrowing to supplier credits. It is estimated that
in 1979, INECEL had a debt equity ratio of 40:60 (on a non-consolidated basis),
EEQ a ratio of 35:65 and all the other subsidiaries averaged a relation of
8:92. This may be attributed to the limited expertise of local financial
managers and also to the red tape involved in obtaining the approval of the
government, and to the high cost associated with obtaining the guarantees
foreign lenders usually require.
5.09       Thus, there is room for improvement in financial management at
the sector level. It is expected that both the organization study and the
training component included in the project would address this issue. Further-
more, at negotiations it was agreed that INECEL will submit to the Bank, not
later than October 31, 1981, a program which inter alia sets up a long-term
borrowing strategy for itself and for its subsidiaries, proposes mechanisms
to limit the subsidiaries' traditional reliance on INECEL as lender of first
resort, and provides the subsidiaries with assistance in obtaining long-term
financing.
Tariffs and Rate of Return
5.10      As of late 1979, average electricity tariffs stood below the real
levels prevailing in the early 1970's, before the major oil price rises.
On a comparative basis, tariffs were lower than in any other Latin American
country with such a high proportion (about 75%) of thermal generation. Early
in 1980, a new tariff structure, which resulted in an average increase of
about 20%, was implemented and in November 1980 a policy of monthly increases,
averaging about 1.3%, was introduced. In February/March 1981 some rates
were selectively increased and in May 1981 a new policy of monthly increases,
averaging 3%, was put into effect. Despite these measures, tariffs are not
yet providing a reasonable contribution to investment, while from an economic
viewpoint they appear to be still below marginal cost (para. 6.05), thereby
encouraging excessive use, and waste, of electricity.
5.11      Thus, continuation of the policy of increases currently in force
is required.  The average electricity tariffs proposed, and their relation
to historic values, are shown in the following table.

3/   For calculating the constant US dollar series, an exchange rate of S/.20.9
per dollar in 1970, and of S/.25 thereafter was used. The deflator applied
is the US consumer price index, for which increases of 14% in 1980 and of
9% per year thereafter were assumed.
5.12      At negotiations, it was agreed that the need for tariff increases
discussed in para. 5.10 could be adressed through progressive action. Thus,
it was further agreed that:
(a)  The consolidated rate of return for INECEL and its subsidiaries
will be 4% in 1982, 8% in 1983, and 8.5% in 1984 and thereafter;
(b)  the rate of return for INECEL alone will be 4% in 1982, 8% in
1983, and 8.5% in 1984 and thereafter;
(c)  the provisions of the tariff legislation dealing with automatic
tariff adjustments to cost variations will be implemented no later
than January 1, 1982;
(d)  INECEL will submit monthly information on retail tariffs actually
charged, which the Bank will monitor to ensure that they are
consistent with the agreed targets (para 5.03); and
(e)  until quarterly consolidated financial statements satisfactory to
the Bank can be submitted in a timely manner, a quarterly information
system covering INECEL and its subsidiaries willd be designed and
implemented effective January 1, 1982, so as to enable the Bank
to reasonably monitor rate of return performance on a timely basis,
and to serve as an information input for automatic tariff adjust-
ments. To achieve this, INECEL will submit the quarterly reports
within 75 days of the end of the corresponding quarter.

5.14      The Bank has worked closely with INECEL and with the Government in
developing a suitable program financing scheme. As indicated earlier (para.
5.04), substantial funding is expected from the Government, and between 1981
and 1985 new loans amounting to about US$1.6 billion are aLso to be raised
from international lending agencies, suppliers and commercial banks (see
Annex 5, Table 5.5).



- 31 -
5.15      The financing scheme for the project is discussed in paragraph 4.20.
The proposed Bank loan would have a maturity of 17 years, including a four
year grace period. These are the standard terms for Ecuador. For financial
projection purposes, an interest rate of 10% per year and a commitment fee of
0.75% were assumed. In view of the magnitude of INECEL's investment program
and of the major program cofinancing effort envisaged, financing of interest
during construction until mid 1984 is recommended. By then Paute is expected
to be in full commercial operation, which will allow substantial fuel savings
thus providing a large increase in gross internal cash generation.
Future Finances
5.16      The consolidated financial projections are based on the assumption
that retail tariffs will be progressively increased, so as to achieve rates
of return (on a rate base composed of average net revalued fixed assets and a
provision for working capital) of 4% in 1982, 8% in 1983 and 8.5% in 1984 and
after. This calls for nominal increases in the average retail price (inclusive
of fuel clause) paid by consumers of 32% in 1981, 56% in 1982, 18% in 1983,
and 23% in 1984.
5.17      The rates of return indicated above would enable INECEL and its
subsidiaries to make a contribution of about 15% to their 1982-85 consolidated'
investment program, which is reasonable in view of the magnitude of the works
involved. Furthermore, by 1985 INECEL's consolidated contribution is expected
to have increased to 33%. At negotiations, it was agreed that INECEL will
retain all earnings - and further, cause its subsidiaries to retain all
earnings - for investment in the sector, unless otherwise agreed by the Bank.
5.18      The debt-equity ratio is expected to fall in the period considered,
mainly because of the large amount of Government equity contributions forecast
and also because of the heavy debt amortization service through 1985, which
reflects the relatively short terms which have characterized INECEL's past
borrowings. This suggests that, once tariffs reach reasonable levels, it may
be feasible to finance a larger proportion of INECEL's investment needs
through long-term borrowings, simultaneously reducing the sector's dependence
on Government funds (para. 5.10). Debt service coverage is forecast to be
very poor through 1982, but this is substantially offset by the commitments
undertaken by the Government to provide equity contributions. At negotiations,
it was agreed that INECEL will obtain the Bank's concurrence before incurring
additional long-term debt, if its internal cash generation is less than 1.5
times its maximum future debt service requirement.
5.19      The short-term financial position is expected to be fairly comforta-
ble during the project construction period. Furthermore, to avoid any delays
in project or program implementation caused by transitory financial tightness,
at negotiations the Government agreed that it would make its best efforts to
deal with requests from INECEL, or from its subsidiaries, for authorization
to borrow from local banks, so that processing times do not exceed 30 days.
5.20      Improvements in billing procedures already underway and further review
of commercial practices to be carried out as part of the organization study
should eventually result in lower collection periods, improving liquidity.



- 32 -
Furthermore, at negotiations the Government agreed that it would pay its
electricity bills when due and cause its agencies to proceed in the same
manner and INECEL agreed that it will institute a satisfactory system of
surcharges for late payment, which would be specially relevant for the munici-
palities. 1/ Reporting requirements on public sector receivables were also
agreed upon. To enable timely monitoring, these reports will be submitted
quarterly, within 75 days of the end of the quarter. They will provide
information on the aging of receivables from each public sector agency
or institution.
5.21      In view of the magnitude of the sector's investment program and
the possibility that local interests may wish to alter the timing (thus
deviating from the optimum determined from the Master Plan Optimization
Studies) of the future hydro-projects, at negotiations agreement was reached
with INECEL and the Government that they will (a) consult the Bank before
undertaking commitments to any capital expenditure (other than those already
included in the Master Plan) which would increase the gross fixed assets in
operation of the power sector by 2% or more and furnish a report (satisfactory
to the Bank) showing the economic justification and financing plan of the
proposed project; and (b) ensure that the expansion of the power sector in
Ecuador is carried out in a coordinated manner in order to prevent waste,
duplication and unnecessary investment on the basis of economically justified
programs within the limits of INECEL's (or other sector agencies, if applicable)
financial and managerial capacity.
Financial and Performance Indicators
5.22      The historic and forecast values for key financial indicators are
shown in Annex 5, table 5.8. Annex 4, table 4.5 presents selected indicators
showing INECEL's expected achievements through 1985. At negotiations, agreement
was reached on the target values set and on the periodicity with which INECEL
will inform the Bank on its performance with respect to each of the indicators
listed.
6.   ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01      INECEL, with the assistance of individual experts, prepared the 1980-85
transmission expansion program based on a national load forecast covering the
period 1979-90 (see paras. 3.05 and 3.06) and on detailed analyses of the
projected regional consumption patterns. Furthermore, comparisons of several
transmission and local power generating plant alternatives were carried out by
them.
1/   The appraisal mission was unable to obtain enough data from INECEL's
subsidiaries to evaluate whether overdue public sector accounts posed a
significant problem. However, there are indications that some munici-
palities experience considerable delays.



- 33 -
6.02      The transmission line parameters (voltage levels, conductor sizes,
span lengths and line routings) for the Guayaquil-Santa Elena, Milagro-Machala,
Cuenca-Loja, Ibarra-Tulcan and Totoras-Ambato lines and the design of the
corresponding substations were optimized in order to determine the corres-
ponding least-cost transmission alternative. Subsequently, each optimized
transmission line was compared to an equivalent thermo-electric power plant.
The comparison of the net present value of capital and operating/maintenance
economic costs of the different alternatives demonstrated that the recommended
transmission alternatives are the corresponding least-cost solutions at dis-
count rates of up to 50% (Annex 6, table 6.1). Sensitivity analyses were also
carried out to evaluate the effects of variations in capital costs, variations
in fuel costs, and variations in other major costs. These analyses demonstrated
that, for reasonable changes in the various parameters, the selected transmis-
sion alternatives remain the least-cost solutions.
6.03      The 230 kV, 205 km, Paute-Totoras transmission line would complete
the SNI interconnecting ring circuit, thus strengthening and improving the
reliability, stability and load flow of the SNI transmission network. This
line was originally scheduled to be commissioned in early 1987, when the
Paute - Phase C - hydro development is expected to become operational.
Recent system load flow and stability studies carried-out by INECEL have
shown, however, that the line should be commissioned earlier and an economic
evaluation requested by the Bank has demonstrated the merits of advancing its
commissioning to early 1985, mainly due to the savings attributable to the re-
duction of outage costs, which otherwise will occur. Consequently, the Bank
agreed to include this line as a component of the proposed project.
Return on Investment
6.04       Since the proposed project is an integral part of INECEL's 1980-85
investment program, its benefits cannot be singled out. Thus, the rate of
return on the overall investment program was computed. The rate of return on
the investment was estimated as the discount rate which equalizes the present
values of the economic net cost and benefit streams associated with the
investment program. The economic net cost streams include the associated
capital investments and operational and maintenance costs of: (a) generation
program - including Esmeraldas (thermal), Agoyan (hydro) and Paute - phase
A, B and C (hydro); (b) transmission program (ongoing works and the proposed
project); (c) 1980-85 subtransmission, distribution and rural electrification
programs; and (d) general investments (studies, buildings, transportation,
furniture, and such). The economic net benefit streams were measured by:
(a) forecast revenues from incremental sales of electricity (corresponding
to the energy to be produced by the new power generating plants being commis-
sioned in 1980-85 at the average retail level as of December 31, 1980 and,
alternatively, at the forecast tariff levels (para. 5.03); and (b) energy
substitution (the hydro-power plants under consideration would substitute for
thermal generation, freeing considerable amounts of fuel) valued at current
international fuel prices (Annex 6, table 6.2).
6.05      The internal rate of return of the expansion program using pre-
vailing tariff levels as of December 31, 1980, was about 7%, which may be

estimated at 11%. However, if benefits are measured on the basis of fore-
cast tariff levels, the internal rate of return would be about 13% (Annex 6,
table 6.2). These results support the conclusion that current tariff levels
are inadequate. They also strengthen the recommended Bank's position that
by 1985 present tariffs should be increased to the levels required to provide
an 8.5% financial rate of return (para. 5.03).
6.06      The rates obtained understate the real economic return of the
program, because revenues from the sales of electricity do not fully reflect
some of the benefits to society, industry and commerce, whose welfare,
production and employment depend on reliable electricity supply. Furthermore,
the following caveats should be noted: (a) no allowance has been made for
the degree of over-investment which is naturally built-in to the trans-
mission and distribution programs, which have been dimensioned to accommodate
expected future demand increases, (b) benefits resulting from outage reduction
due to improved system reliability have not been taken into account, and
(c) expected benefits from improved system operation when the Load Dispatch
Center becomes operational and from management and efficiency improvements
expected from the organizational study and training program have not been
quantified. However, the preceding considerations do not diminish the validity
of the analyses regarding the tariff level increases required.
Sensitivity Analyses
6.07      Sensitivity analyses were also carried out to determine the effect
on the internal rate of return (with benefits measured both at prevailing and
forecast tariff levels) by variations in capital costs, in operational and
maintenance costs, and in revenues (Annex 6, table 6.3). The rate of return
on the expansion program (with benefits evaluated at forecast tariff levels)
would drop to about 10% if costs are 10% higher than estimated and expected
revenues are 10% lower. If the investment program costs do not increase but
benefits decrease by 10%, the rate-of-return would drop to 11%. Furthermore,
the rate-of-return will drop to 12% if costs are 10% higher and benefits
remain unchanged.
7. SUMMARY OF PROPOSED AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations agreements were reached on the following
principal points:
(a)  With the Government that:
(i) the prices of fuels used for electricity generation will
be progressively increased, so that by 1984 they represent
not less than 50% of the world prices then prevailing
(para. 1.15);
(ii)  it will take such actions as may be required to expedite
procurement authorizations and clearances, so as to avoid
delays in project implementation (para. 2.11);



- 35 -
(iii) it will make equity contributions to INECEL in specified
amounts, and will also make-up any shortfall in oil royalties
through additional equity contributions (para. 5.04);
(iv)  it will make its best efforts to deal with requests, from
INECEL or from its subsidiaries, for authorization to borrow,
so that processing time does not exceed 30 days (para. 5.19);
(v) it will pay its electricity bills when due, and also cause its
agencies to pay their bills when due (para. 5.20); and
(vi)  projects undertaken in the future will be economically
justified and adequately financed (para. 5.21).
(b)  With INECEL that:
(i) all electric services will be consolidated in ten regional
companies by December 31, 1984 (para. 1.18);
(ii)  not later than September 30, 1981, it will submit a proposal
on a mechanism (including main operational characteristics and
target dates for implementation) to transfer funds between
companies, to enable all of them to meet financing require-
ments and rate of return targets (para. 1.29);
(iii) it will furnish to the Bank, not later than October 31, 1982
the results of a study on the marginal cost of electricity
generation and its proposals for a more comprehensive study,
which would enable INECEL to revise its tariff structures
(para. 1.32);
(iv)  it will engage management consultants not later than
December 31, 1981; discuss their recommendations with the
Bank and implement those that are agreed upon (para. 2.03);
(v) it will submit to the Bank, prior to loan effectiveness, an
interim program to improve the direction and supervision of
its subsidiaries (para. 2.06);
(vi)  it will engage consultants for training on or before December 31,
1981 (para. 2.10);
(vii) it will implement measures so that it may submit fully
consolidated financial statements by 1983 and be able to
meet mutually agreed interim consolidation targets for
1981 and 1982 (para. 2.14(a));
(viii) it will engage qualified experts (on terms of reference
acceptable to the Bank, and not later than December 31, 1981)
to inventory INECEL's fixed assets, assess their replacement
value and design appropriate recording systems; and will
reflect such valuations in its records and financial statements
(para. 2.14(b));



- 36 -
(ix)  it will reflect a provisional revaluation of fixed assets in
operation, on the basis of inflation indices, in the 1980
financial statements (para. 2.14(c));
(x) it will furnish to the Bank, on or before specific dates
programs which identify the accounting problems faced by each
subsidiary and contain specific proposals to address them,
and, also, that it will cause all its subsidiaries to revalue
their fixed assets per an agreed timetable and will assist
and supervise them in this exercise (para. 2.15);
(xi)  it will engage private external auditors by March 31, 1982
(para. 2.17);
(xii)  it will cause each of its subsidiaries to engage independent
external auditors by agreed dates (para. 2.18);
(xiii)  the Paute-Amaluza dam will be inspected at least once a
year by qualified and experienced experts, and a copy of
the inspection report will be submitted to the Bank
(para. 2.20);
(xiv)  it will engage consultants to carry out a study of
distribution losses not later than December 31, 1981, and
will implement such recommendations as subsequently agreed
with the Bank per an agreed timetable (para. 3.11);
(xv)  it will assume responsibility for supervising the sub-
transmission works and ensuring their timely completion and
will report periodically on work progress (para. 4.11);
(xvi)  it will engage consultants for the overall supervision of
the project on or before September 30, 1982 (para. 4.26);
(xvii)  it will submit performance indicators regularly to the
Bank (para. 4.27);
(xviii)  not later than October 31, 1981 it will submit a program
which sets up a long term borrowing strategy, and will
provide assistance to its subsidiaries for obtaining access
to credit (para. 5.09);
(xix)  it will take all measures required to achieve a consoli-
dated rate of return for INECEL and its subsidiaries of
4% in 1982, 8% in 1983 and 8.5% in 1984 and thereafter.
These same rates of return will also be applicable to INECEL
(para. 5.12);
(xx) it will implement automatic tariff adjustment legislation no
later than January 1, 1982 (para. 5.12);



- 37 -
(xxi) it will submit monthly tariff information, to enable the Bank
to monitor compliance of the agreements on tariff increases.
A quarterly information system to monitor rate of return
performance (until quarterly consolidated financial statements
can be available on a timely basis), will be designed and
implemented by January 1, 1982 (para. 5.12);
(xxii) it will retain all its earnings and cause its subsidiaries
to retain their earnings for reinvestment in the sector
(para. 5.17);
(xxiii) it will obtain the Bank's concurrence before incurring in
additional long term debt, if its internal cash generation
is forecast to be less than 1.5 times its maximum future
debt service requirements (para. 5.18);
(xxiv) it will institute a satisfactory system of penalties for
late payment of electricity bills and will provide the
Bank with quarterly information on accounts receivable,
to be submitted within 75 days of the end of the quarter
(para. 5.20);
(xxv) it will consult the Bank before undertaking commitments to any
capital expenditure (other than those included in the Master
Plan) which would increase the gross fixed assets in operation
of the power sector by 2% or more; and ensure that the expansion
of the power sector in Ecuador is carried out in a coordinated
manner in order to prevent waste, duplication and unnecessary
investment on the basis of economically justified programs
(para. 5.21).
7.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan would be that:
(a)  a satisfactory preliminary program for improving INECEL's control
over its subsidiaries had been submitted (para. 2.06);
(b)  private external auditors for INECEL had been selected (para. 2.17).
7.03      Failure to implement the recently enacted policy of monthly tariff
increases averaging 3% would be an event of default (para. 1.27).
7.04      Retroactive financing for consultants' services since June 1,
1981 in an amount not exceeding US$1,000,000 is recommended (para. 4.24).
7.05      With the above assurances, the project would constitute a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$100 million, to be repaid over a period of 17
years, including four years of grace.

a/  IMECEL and all its subsidiaries (the private company, EMELEC, is therefore excluded).
bJ  Based on the mission estimates shown in Annex 3.1  , after deducting autoproduction and sales by EMELEC.
4/ Residually determined, so aS to achieve the target rates of return set.
4/ Based on system simulation to minimize operating costs.
S/ Forecasted, on the basis of historic behavior, as a Constant proportion (5%) of retail sales revenues.
/ Fuel consumption was forecasted on the assumption of a progressive reduction in subtransmission and distribution losses, from 14% in 1980 to
12.1% in 1985.  Foel price forecasts are based on the following assumptions: (i) world prices will rise at a rate of 11% per year, (which
is 2% above the forecasted world inflation rate), (U) interml prices will be increased at this rate and, in addition, a 33% increase will
be put into effect on January 1,1983 so that internal prices will then represent 50% of world prices.
4 Salaries and other 0 & M expenses incurred by the SKI were forecasted on the basis of the following relationships (which are consistent
with historic experience)to the corresponding gross revalued assets in operation: hydro generation 1.091%, thermal generation 2.902% and
transmission 2.45%.  0 & M expenses (excluding fuel and depreciation) incurred by IlECEL's subsidiaries were forecasted on the basis of
their relationship (in 1978) to total gross assets in operation, this was 9.888%. To the extent that the largest component of 0 & M
expenses are wages, and there is some evidence of overstaffing, it may be feasible to achieve lower 0 & M costs than forecasted.
4/ Annual depreciation charges were estimated using the following percentages of revalued gross fixed assets in operation: hydro plants 2.25%,
thermal plants 3%, transmission lines 2.78%, distribution facilities 3.5%, all other facilities 4%.
4/ Refers to losses which were not charged against income when incurred; it was assumed such practice will not be repeated.
A/Includes miscellaneous small items.
/  Mainly the costs of sector planning and supervision, as well as administrative overheads.  INECEL does not identify these costs in its
income statements, but nets them against its participation in oil royalties.
E/ REQ has a profit sharing system with its employees.
/ As provided in Ecuador's tariff legislation, the rate base is given by average revalued net fixed assets in operation plus 3% (as an
estimation of intangible assets), plus a provision for working capital. The latter is calculated as three months of 0 & M expenses.
n/ Given by the ratio of net operating income to the rate base.

and 12% per year for foreign and local costs respectively.  Thereafter, the inflation indexes used were 97. and 15% per year, for foreign and local
costs respectively. See Table 5.4, footnote 1.
ii) For INECEL's subsidiaries  adequate data on the time at which investments took place was not available.  To overcome this limitation, assets were
grooped into homogeneous categories, i.e.: hydro generation, diesel geneiation, substations, subtransmission lines (at various voltage levels),
distribution lines, etc. The replacement values, at Decenber 1977 market prices, of these assets were then determined, and further updted using the
same indexes as used for INECELs assets.
c/ See attachment. Annual depreciation charges were calculated in the  inener indicated in footnote h to Table 5.1.  Accumulated dep-eciation was revalued
in the same way as gross fixed assets.
d/ See attachment. Work in progress is not revalued. INECEL capitali.es interest during construction until the assets come into operation and, also, will
capitalize an assigned-cost-of.equity-gapital (of 8.57. per year), applied to the amount in which the specific project is self-financed.
el See attachment. Refers to nun-operational assets and miscellaneous investments.  They have been revalued in the same manner as gross fixed assets.
f/ Forecast   as one month of expenses (exclusive of depreciation), plus 1/12 of annual debt service.
g/ Forecast  as the saum of: 20% of sales revenues (representing an average collection period of 75 days), and 20% of annual revens  from oil royalties.
h/ Forecast as the sum of 57. of net fixed assets in operation and 107. of net non-operational fixed assets.
