I. BACKGROUND
A. BANK PRE-WAR INVOLVEMENT IN ENERGY
1.    The Bank has been heavily involved in the energy sector in Bosnia and
Herzegovina in the past, notably in electric power, petroleum and natural gas. Power
sector projects, which benefitted partly or exclusively BH included the Third Power Loan
(Loan 386-YU; US$75 million; 1972) and the Fourth Power Loan (Loan 1469-YU; US80
million; 1977), both of which helped finance the development -of SFRY's interconnected
power system; the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1561-YU; US$73 million; 1978) was for
development of the hydro power plants on the middle Neretva River; the Sixth Power
Project (Loan 1561-1-YU; US$61 million; 1983) was for construction of the Mostar dam;
the Seventh Power Project (Loan 2338-YU; US$120 million; 1984) financed SFRY's
energy management system; and the Eighth Power Project was for the Visegrad hydro
power plant (Loan 2527-YU; US$125 million; 1985). In the petroleum sector the Bank
financed the First Petroleum Project (Loan 2597-YU; US$92.5 million; 1985) for
development of indigenous energy resources. In the gas sector the Bank financed the
Sarajevo Air Pollution Control Project (Loan 1264-YU; US$38 million; 1975). An
Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project was approved by the Bank's Board of
Directors on May 14, 1996 (Credit TF024034; US$20 million). The Bank did not
previously finance projects in the coal sector in BH.
B. NATURAL GAS
2.    Background. The gas system in BH was developed starting in 1975 under the
Bank's Sarajevo Air Pollution Control Project (Loan 1264-YU). Russian gas is supplied
via Hungary and Serbia and enters BH at Zvornik, in Republika Srpska. As of 1992 the
gas supply network consisted of 190 km of transmission mains and offtake pipes, running
from Zvornik to the Sarajevo area via Semizovac and from the latter to Zenica.
Consumption peaked in 1990 with 610 million cubic meters, constituting 8% of the total
energy consumption in BH. Within Sarajevo, there were 15,000 household connections
and all major boilers of the city's district heating network had been converted from coal to
gas-firing. Gas imports for BH are metered at the Ukraine/Hungarian border (Beregov,
the contractual point of delivery of the gas) and from there they are transported through
the Hungarian and Serb transmission systems to Zvornik. The cost of transporting the gas
from Beregov to BH is equivalent to about 35% of the contracted gas volume. The gas
was imported under a contract between Energopetrol, a state-owned oil and gas company,
and Gazexport, the export branch of Russia's Gazprom. Within BH, gas transmission and
distribution was (and is) the responsibility of Sarajevogas.



- 2 -
3.    Current Situation. At the beginning of the war gas supply coming into Sarajevo
was reduced to such an extent that gas use for industry and much of the district heating
became impossible. With the additional destruction of part of the district heating system
in Sarajevo early on and given a sharp reduction of electricity generation in BH, gas
suddenly assumed major importance for the inhabitants of Sarajevo as a means to stay
warm and to cook. Many improvised connections and appliances were made, which has
often led to explosions and highly inefficient gas use. As of the end of 1995, the total
number of household connections in all of Sarajevo was estimated at around 85,000. Gas
consumption now constitutes about 70% of all energy consumption in Sarajevo and it is
the basic heating and cooking fuel for the city's remaining 300,000 inhabitants.
4.    Debt to Gazexport. While the gas supply from Semizovac to Zenica (the entire
western branch of the transmission system, affecting several major industries along that
line) was shut off during the war. some gas was allowed to come into Sarajevo. In
exchange, gas was allowed to go to Belgrade and to the Bosnian Serbs. The total debt for
gas supplied by Gazexport was US$105 million as of October 12, 1995. Of this total,
GBH claims that only about 30% is owed by it for the supply of gas to the Bosnian part of
Sarajevo. The new agreement signed between Gazexport and Energopetrol calls for
delivery at Beregov of specified quantities of gas for both the Federation and the
Republika Srpska at US$80 per 1,000 m3. Since then, most supplies have been paid for
and efforts are underway to come to a permanent solution for full payment of current gas
consumption.
5.    Sector Strategy. The proposed sector strategy would be to: (i) seek partial donor
funding for the next three years of gas consumption; (ii) reconfigure the gas network and
restore safe service to acceptable levels; (iii) ensure demand management through
disconnection of consumers that can be reconnected to the district heating system,
introduction of energy efficient appliances, and cost recovery, (iv) strengthen the sector
enticy; and (v) settle past debts to Gazexport. An Emergency Gas System Project is
expected to be presented to the Board in FY97.
C. DISTRICT HEATING
6.    Background. In 1991 BH had district heating (DH) systems in most major towns
and cities with a population in excess of about 25,000 inhabitants. The systems were
generally run by municipally-owned district heating enterprises (DHEs). Cogeneration
was provided only by the combined heat and power plants in Tuzla and Kakanj as well as
by local industries; the remaining heat was generated by local heat-only boilers. Already
prior to the war, some efforts had been made to start converting coal-fired boilers to gas
or oil firing, notably in Sarajevo. DH systems throughout BH served 120,000 customers,
equivalent to 450,000 inhabitants or 10% of the total population. The Sarajevo DH
system was the country's largest, serving about 180,000 inhabitants or 45% of the
population of Sarajevo. All DH systems delivered mostly heat only and provided domestic
hot water only to a small percentage of consumers. Heat prices were set locally and were
not uniform nationwide. Subsidies for heat and hot water consumption were provided



based on income level from local tax proceeds.  The average subsidy was US$100 per
annum, compared to an average annual heat bill of about US$370 per consumer.
7.    Current Situation. Currently, the DH systems in Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Bihac
and Mostar are only partly operational. In Sarajevo the system has been damaged due to
shelling and freezing of the pipes in the network; building internal heating installations in
residential dwellings (pipes, radiators and valves) have incurred substantial damage, also
due to the rusting associated with non-usage of the system. In Banja Luka most of the
damage is related to non-usage of the system due to lack of fuel, and associated rusting
and freezing. In all cities, lack of maintenance due to the absence of spare parts has been
significant and further aggravated the problems.
8.    Sector Strategy. The proposed sector strategy would be to: (i) restore urban
district heating services to adequate levels as soon as possible, disconnect previously
serviced flats from the gas system (in Sarajevo) and reduce fuel wood consumption (in
Banja Luka); (ii) rehabilitate building internal heating installations; (iii) strengthen sector
institutions and increase cost recovery; and (iv) undertake master plan studies to prepare
plans for the optimal configuration of each city's future heating system. An Emergency
District Heating Reconstruction Project was approved by the Board of Directors on May
14, 1996.
D. ELECTRIC POWER
9.    Background. In 1990 BH produced 13,090 Gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity
from generating plants located on its territory. Electricity consumption was 11,181 GWh.
The system comprised 13 hydro power plants with a total capacity of 2,034 Megawatt
(MW) and an average output of 6,922 GWh/year, and 12 thermal power plants with a
total capacity of 1,957 Megawatt (MW) and an output of 10,675 GWh in 1990. The
thermal power plants were coal and lignite fired, with the fuel coming from mines within
BH. EPBiH was responsible for operating its own system and meeting local demand.
However, being part of the former Yugoslav network, the 400 kV power grid in BH was
controlled by JUGEL's dispatching center in Belgrade. Power exchanges with neighboring
countries were also controlled by JUGEL.
10.   The BH power system was operated by Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine
(EPBiH) and consists of generation, transmission and distribution facilities interconnected
and operated at 400, 220, 110, 35, 20, 10 and 0.4 kV voltage levels. Transmission
voltages are 110 kV and higher; distribution voltages are 35 kV and lower. Total length
of the transmission lines was about 5,400 km and of the distribution lines 92,000 km.
Transmission and distribution transformer capacity was about 15,300 MVA.  The
backbone of the interconnected transmission system is a 400 kV network (with a
transmission line length of about 800 km and with 8 substations), which is interconnected
with Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. The 400 kV transmission line section of Trebinje-
Gacko-Mostar forms part of the southern main line interconnecting the member countries
of SUDEL (Austria, Italy, Greece, Former Yugoslavia) and UCPTE.



11.   Current Situation. War damage to the BH power system started in 1991 with
destruction of transmission facilities and interconnection lines to neighboring countries and
UCPTE and thereafter spread to large parts of the generation, transmission and
distribution systems. A description of the damage follows:
Generation: Installed capacity in the Federation area was 2,574 MW (or 65% of
the total installed capacity in BiH) and 49% of its generating capacity is currently
damaged. The following hydropower plants on the Neretva River are damaged or
out of operation for other reasons: Jablanica (6x25 MW); Grabovica (2x57 MW);
Salakovac (3x70 MW); Mostar (3x25 MW); and the Rama plant on the Rama river
(2x80 MW). The Tuzla (779 MW) and Kakanj (578 MW) thermal power plants
also suffered extensive damage. The condition of the hydro power plants on the
Trebisnjica River (2x54 MW, lx60 MW, 2 x 215 MW, and lx8 MW) and on the
Drina River (3x105 MW), and the Ugljevik (1x300 MW) and Gracko (1x300
MW) thermal power plants has seriously deteriorated due to lack of maintenance
as a result of the war. In 1994, generation of the major power plants in the
Federation area was only 1,744 GWh (41% of the total generation in BiH).
Transmission: About 60% of the transmission network and control system are
seriously damaged.  Many transformer stations, including all eight 400 kV
transformer substations, civil works, telecommunications and maintenance
equipment are seriously damaged or destroyed. The interconnection with SUIDEL
and UCPTE has been interrupted, as well as the connection of Greece with
SUDEL through the 400 kV line through Mostar.
Distribution: The distribution network is largely destroyed. During the first half
of 1994 residential consumers in the Federation area received only 4-6 hours of
electricity per day. The Government introduced rationing of electricity in 1995.
Residential consumers were allowed a maximum of 180 kWh/month/household in
May 1995.
12.   Sector Strategy. The proposed sector strategy would be to: (i) restore service to
acceptable levels; (ii) reconfigure the electric power network to optimize the system,
taking into account BH's need for significant independence from the SFRY's network and
its security of supply, (iii) improve sector finances by improving billing and collections and
gradually revising the tariff structure and levels to reflect supply costs for each category of
consumers; and (iv) restructure the sector by introducing a sector structure and regulatory
framework that would facilitate attracting potential investors
E. COAL
13.   Background. In the 1980's the coal rnines in BH produced annually about 18
million tons of coal, of which 10 rnillion tons of brown coal and 8 million tons of lignite.
Their brown coal output accounted for about 80% of total SFRY production, lignite for
only 15%. Production was concentrated in areas near Tuzla and Zenica in both open pit



- 5 -
as well as underground mines. In addition, two mines in the Republika Srpska were
important: Ugljevik (brown coal) and Gracko (lignite). About half of the production
originated from surface mines and the other half from underground mines. BH's proven
reserves of coal are about 1.6 billion tons. More than 80% of BH's total production was
used for electric power generation and the remaining 20% for industrial and household
uses.
14.   Current Situation. Coal production dropped to 1.5 million tons in 1994, i.e. less
than 10% of the pre-war level. The coal mines in the Federation have been grouped into
two principal companies: the Tuzla Coal Mines and the Central Bosnia Coal Mines, which
supply thermal power plants. The Ugljevik Coal Mine is an important and relatively
modern surface mine in Republika Srpska. Much of the mobile mining equipment has
been cannibalized beyond repair. Some newer mobile equipment had to be turned over to
the army or just disappeared. There is an acute lack of critical materials such as fuel, tires
and spare parts.
15.   Despite the drastic drop in production, no efforts were made to concentrate
production in a few large and economic mines. The number of people employed has
decreased from 26,000 to about 7,000. Since production declined much faster,
productivity is now among the lowest in the world. Present production costs appear to be
at or above the world market level of coal prices adjusted for quality and are higher than
sales prices, which are set by the State. To ensure future financial viability, coal mining
enterprises need to close uneconomic capacity.
16.   Sector Strategy. The proposed sector strategy would be to: (i) determine priority
actions for the lowest cost mines whose output is competitive with imports; (ii) restore
output of the lowest-cost mines to minimum acceptable levels (para 24 (j)); and (iii)
restructure the coal industry, including closing uneconomic mining capacity and
privatizing services and the most efficient mines wherever possible
I. BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY
17.   The conclusion of the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement in December 1995 ended
Europe's most destructive war in the last fifty years. The war has shattered the economy
and brought productive activity almost to a standstill. The country's pre-war GDP of
about US$9 billion has shrunk to about US$2 billion, and its per-capita GDP declined
from about US$1900 to about US$500. The majority of the 900,000 workers employed in
1991 are currently still unemployed. Wages and salariesare low. Pensions are paid but at
low levels. Many people still receive some form of humanitarian assistance. At least 200-
250,000 people are dead or missing, and over 1 million people left the country. In
addition, there are about 1.5 million displaced people in the country, many of whom live in
temporary shelters.  Enormous damage has been inflicted on the country's physical



- 6 -
infrastructure, including energy. Direct war damages are huge, probably in the range of
US$15-20 billion. Indirect damage due to lack of maintenance and corrosion accounts for
many more billions of dollars of losses.
A. SECTOR RECONSTRUCTION PROGRAM
18.   A reconstruction and rehabilitation program for the combined energy sectors of
BH  of about US$900 million has been prepared as part of the US$5.1 billion
reconstruction program for all sectors, over 3-4 years, which the Bank has helped to
develop in a joint effort with the country and the donor community. The energy sector
program calls for a major effort to restore destroyed, damaged and forcibly neglected
equipment and to bring service back as soon as possible to near pre-war levels. The
proposed project will be the second major element in this program, following the
Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project (Credit TF 024034 of US$20 million;
May 1996). It aims to ensure restoration of reliable and continuous electricity supply to a
number of major cities and industries. The financing of some urgently needed equipment
for the power sector is already included under the Bank's Emergency Recovery Project.
19.   A third emergency project in the energy sector planned for FY97 is the Emergency
Gas System Reconstruction Project, which focuses mostly on Sarajevo. Projects with a
medium term perspective would deal with further reconstruction and rehabilitation of the
various energy sectors and would address broader policy issues such as the sector's
regulatory framework, energy pricing, sector restructuring, and eventual privatization in
more detail.
B. WORLD BANK STRATEGY AND PROGRAMS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
20.   On April 1, 1996 BH fulfilled the conditions of succession to the Socialist Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia's membership in the Bank, IDA and IFC.  Membership is
retroactive to February 25, 1993.
21.   Since early 1995, the Bank Group has been deeply involved in developing a donor-
funded reconstruction program for BH. A joint mission of the Bank, IMF, EU and EBRD
in late 1995 resulted in the proposed Priority Reconstruction Program which was first
presented to a donors' meeting, co-sponsored by the Bank and the EU in Brussels, a week
after the signing of the Paris/Dayton Peace Agreement. This meeting led to donor
commitments of about US$600 million for immediate reconstruction activities. A second
donors' conference, again co-chaired by the Bank and the EU, was held in mid-April, 1996
and resulted in additional donor pledges in the order of US$1.2 billion for financing
priority reconstruction activities during 1996.
22.   The Bank has been following a two-track assistance strategy, which seeks to
leverage its limited resources with significant resource transfer from donors. First, before



- 7 -
arrears resolution, the Bank supported selected immediate assistance programs through a
special Trust Fund for Reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina (TFBH) which is
providing US$125 million on concessional terms equivalent to those offered by IDA, as
well as an additional US$25 million in grant funds.  Seven emergency operations,
committing the entire US$150 million, have been approved under the TFBH: an
Emergency Recovery Project; a Water, Sanitation, and Solid Waste Urgent Works
Project; an Emergency Farm Reconstruction Project; an Emergency Transport Project; an
Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project; an Emergency Education
Reconstruction Project and a War Victims Rehabilitation Project. Second, following
arrears resolution (which was made possible by the effectiveness of the Consolidation
Loan package on June 14, 1996), while the Bank will continue to focus on supporting the
implementation of the reconstruction program, its assistance program will be broadened to
include support for the initial phase of the Government's macroeconomic and institutional
reforms.  In the area of reconstruction, Bank assistance will focus on employment
generation and housing, both needed to facilitate the reintegration of demobilized soldiers
and the return of refugees, as well as on continued support for the rehabilitation of
infrastructure and clearance of landmines.
III. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
23.   The objectives of the project would be to: (i) restore electricity service to
acceptable levels in major cities and for vital industries. Initial reconstruction would target
mainly critical power plants (including notably cogeneration plants), principal substations
and major transmission lines; (ii) increase coal production in the most efficient mines to
supply the fuel necessary for the cogeneration and power-only thermal plants; (iii)
reconfigure the electric power network, taking into account BH's need for significant
independence from Belgrade and security of electricity supply, (iv) enhance the sector's
institutional capacity and improve its finances; and (v) support sector restructuring. In
addition, the project would establish a procurement monitoring and audit unit for all
Bank/IDA financed, cofinanced or administered projects.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
24.   The proposed project has electric power generation, transmission and distribution
components, an associated coal mining component and, in addition, a procurement
monitoring and audit unit component. The electric power component of the project is



- 8 -
described in detail in Attachment I and would consist of components (a) through (i) as
follows:
a) Rehabilitation of Hydro Power Stations. Rehabilitation and maintenance of
hydro plant at:  (i) Jablanica (4x25 MW); (ii) Grabovica (2x57 MW); (iii)
Mostar (3x25 MW); and (iv) Jajce I (2x25 MW). The project would restore the
plants to normal operating condition;
b) Rehabilitation of Thermal Power Stations. Rehabilitation and maintenance of:
(i) the Tuzla cogeneration plant (IxlOO MW); (ii) the Kakanj cogeneration plant
(2xl 10 MW); and (iii) the Ugljevik power station (1x300 NW). The project
would restore the units to provide reliable continuous service for up to another
seven to eight years,
c) Reconstruction of Transmission Lines and Substations. Reconstruction of about
350 km of 220 kV and 110 kV transmission lines, and thirty one 220/110/35 kV
and 110/35/10 kV substations needed for rebuilding the damaged power supply
system, restoring power supply to the cut-off areas, and improving the reliability
of supply for Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, Mostar, Gorazde, Foca, Banja Luka,
Bihac and their environs;
d) Reconstruction of Distribution Networks. This would cover the most urgent
reconstruction needs of the distribution networks in the districts of Sarajevo,
Tuzla, Zenica, Mostar, Doboj, Bihac, Grahovo, G. Vakuf, Maglaj, Banja Luka,
Bijeljina, Pale, Trebinje, Gorazde, Foca, Kopaci, Glamoc and Jajce;
e) Repair of Communication and System Control. The system control and
communication system has been extensively damaged. To retain control of the
power system, the microwave link Sarajevo-Kakanj and the Sarajevo Load
Dispatch Center have to be urgently repaired,
f) Purchase of Service Vehicles. Most of EPBiH's service vehicles were damaged
during the war. The project would supply vehicles for generation, transmission
and distributions maintenance, and for billing and collection services;
g) Purchase of Spare Parts.  The spare parts to be ordered are primarily for
maintenance of existing generation plants and for the transmission and
distribution systems. This includes the reestablishment of sufficient stock levels
with a minimum inventory level of two years at the time of project completion;
h) Technical Assistance comprises engineering and consultants services as follows:
(i) engineering services for preparation of bidding documents, technical
approvals of vender offers, drawings and designs, construction supervision,
inspection and expediting, and general assistance to the electric utilities in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. It will comprise international power experts' services
and a large number of man-months of local engineering consultants' services



-9-
over a period of 24 months; and (ii) consultants' services to prepare a sector
restructuring study (para 27), a tariff study and a least cost investment plan;
i) Project Management Support. A project management support component is
included for partial repair of office facilities and the supply of basic office
equipment for the Project Implementation Unit of EPBiH;
j) Associated Coal Mines. The emergency rehabilitation of selected economically
viable coal mines (the Dubrave, Sikylje and Banovici surface mines, and the
Mramor underground mine of the Tuzla Mining Company, the Vrtliste surface
mine and Breza underground mine at Kakanj of the Central Bosnia Mining
Company, and the Ugljevik surface mine at Ugljevik) focuses on meeting the
coal supply needs of the Tuzla, Kakanj and Ugljevik thermal power plants. To
meet the power plants' requirements, urgent rehabilitation of these specific coal
mines is required. The rehabilitation would mainly consist of: (i) supply of
consumable materials, such as tires, conveyor belts, cable and spare parts for the
existing equipment; (ii) replacement of key smaller equipment damaged beyond
repair, but crucial to operation and maintenance; (iii) overhaul of major
production equipment; and (iv) provision of consultants' services to assist the
Government in preparing a coal sector restructuring program (Attachment 2.1);
and
k) Procurement Monitoring and Audit Unit. To optimize the benefits of the
ongoing Emergency Reconstruction Program and to promote mobilization of
additional resources from abroad, the objectives of efficiency and economy
should be adhered to at all times. This objective would be achieved by the
creation of a Procurement Monitoring and Auditing Unit (PMAU) that ensures
transparency of procurement process in all Government-executed projects,
regardless of the source of their financing. The Government is expected to
establish formally such a PMAU not later than October 31,1996.
25.   Because of the urgency of  establishing an effective and well functioning
procurement monitoring and auditing system as soon as possible, an interim arrangement
for one year, starting September 1, 1996 would entrust this function to an experienced and
reputable international firm. During the first year the PMAU consultants would: (a)
monitor at least one full cycle of procurement and disbursement transactions carried-out
by each executing agency (PIU) for Bank/IDA financed or administered projects. The
selection of the transactions at their different stages of processing would be made
randomly. Monitoring of additional contracts or steps of processing for the same project
will be necessary only in cases of observed important deficiencies in procurement
practices; (b) carry out ex-post annual procurement audits for all projects financed by the
Bank up to September 1, 1996; (c) prepare specific audits as requested by Government or
by the Bank as needed; (d) submit findings according to a pre-agreed time table to the
head of the executing agency, the government and the Bank for all the audits referred to
above and according to a pre-agreed schedule, including recommendations for
improvements or adjustments; (e) design a monitoring and auditing system with



- 10-
appropriate policies and procedures to be applied to all Government financed projects in
Bosnia and Herzegovina; and (f) provide necessary training to a core staff to take over the
full procurement auditing function by September 1997 (Attachment 2.2).
C. SECTOR RESTRUCTURING
26.   There are today, de facto, three entities in the power sector in BH: (i) EPBiH; (ii)
Elektroprivreda Herzeg-Bosna, operating in the Croat areas of the Federation and which is
not integrated with the Croatian power entity; and (iii) Elektroprivreda Republika Srpska,
operating in the Republika Srpska and which exchanges power with Serbia. Because the
core of the BH electricity system (almost 50% of all installed capacity, containing both
hydro as well as thermal power plants) is managed by EPBiH, IDA would focus its
funding on the EPBiH-managed part of the system, while the EU, the EBRD and some
other donors would primarily focus on distribution and generation in BH.
27.   While the power system may be too small to enable effective competition,
measures can and should be taken to introduce a sector structure that would facilitate
attracting potential investors as follows:
a) In a first stage, generation could be separated from transmission and distribution
and broken down in several generating companies, each operating on a
commercial basis; the transmission system could be unified under a single
authority to ensure the optimization of power transmission and permit effective
power trading as well as system stabilization. Distribution enterprises could be
organized on a local basis. As part of a proposed power sector restructuring
study an Energy Law should be prepared (and eventually passed), under which a
Regulatory Authority should be set up to regulate power prices and to ensure
third party access to the transmission system.
b) In a second stage, once the Regulatory Authority has been established and
operates with reasonable autonomy, the generation and distribution companies
could be partially or totally privatized. The transmission entity could eventually
be considered for privatization after the new ownership arrangements in the
generation and distribution segments have stabilized. Regardless of whether or
not the transmission entity is privatized, the Energy Law should allow for third
party access. Consultants services will be provided under the proposed project
to assist in carrying out the electricity sector restructuring study.
D. COST ESTIMATE
28.   The estimated total project cost, including physical contingencies of 10%, is
US$196 million equivalent, of which US$180 million for power and US$16 million for
associated coal mines. The foreign exchange cost is US$180 million (or 92% of the total)
and the local cost is about US$16 million equivalent. Project components for generation,



- I1 -
transmission, distribution and general plant facilities were defined based on detailed war
damage assessments, reconstruction studies, and engineering designs carried out by
EPBiH, Elektroprivreda Herzeg Bosna, Elektroprivreda Republika Srpska, their local
consultants, and by the coal mining companies. The cost estimates reflect end-1995 prices
and are based on the latest international tendering information available for similar works.
They exclude customs duties and taxes, which are expected to be waived for this
emergency project. The cost estimates for the proposed project are summarized in Table
1. Detailed estimates of project cost and estimated annual project expenditures are
provided in Attachments 3 and 4.

E. FINANCING PLAN
29.   The financing plan is shown in Attachment 5. Of the total cost of US$196 million
equivalent, IDA would provide US$35 million to finance reconstruction of the Grabovica
hydro power plant and the Tuzla cogeneration plant and associated coal mines,
transmission substations, spare parts, and project management in the Federation area. The
US$30 million amount for electric power includes a US$3.8 million district heating
component covering goods and works for the Emergency District Heating Reconstruction
Project (TF024034), which is intended to offset the US$3.8 million Project Start-up
Advance for the proposed Project that was made available under the District Heating
Project (para 38). The IDA credit would meet about 18% of the total project cost. The
EU would finance primarily reconstruction of transmission lines and distribution networks.
The EBRD would mainly finance communication and system control and spare parts. The
UK, USA, France, Austria, the Netherlands and Ireland would finance primarily
distribution networks. Switzerland would finance reconstruction of the Jablanica hydro
power plant. Belgium would supply and install part of the transmission substation
equipment. In addition, Norway and other donors would finance international expert
services to assist in engineering and project implementation. Other donors, such as Japan,
the Czech Republic, and the Central European Initiative (CEI) would also contribute to
various project components. Commitments for financing are based on the results of May
20-22, 1996 Infrastructure Technical Meeting with donors held in Paris. A financing gap
of about US$63.0 million (or 32% of the total project cost) still remains. In the event
such additional financing cannot be mobilized by the end of 1996, the project scope would
be adjusted by reducing or eliminating investments in: (i) the Mostar hydro power station
(which requires much more preparatory work before reconstruction can start); and (ii) the
Kakanj thermal power plant and associated coal mine components and deferring these
investments to a possible follow-up project.
F. PROCUREMENT
30.   All procurement of equipment and materials financed by IDA will be in accordance
with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under Emergency Projects for BH as
approved by the Ad Hoc Committee on January 4, 1996. Contracts estimated to cost
more than US$5 million each would be awarded, to the extent possible, through simplified
International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and for contracts estimated to cost between
US$2 million and up to US$5 million each, Limited International Bidding (LIB) will be
used. The aggregate value for ICB is about US$8.3 million (or 24 percent of the total
credit), and the aggregate value for LIB is about US$2.9 million (or 8 percent of the
credit). Standard documents for procurement of goods will be used.
31.   Given the need for quick project implementation and because of the proprietary
nature of much of the equipment needed, the bulk of the equipment for the proposed
project would be procured through International Shopping (IS), and Direct Contracting
(DC). IS will be used for procuring equipment and materials or standard specification
commodities, estimated to cost between US$200,000 and US$2 million per contract up to



- 14 -
an aggregate amount of US$5.5 million (or 16 percent of the total credit). IS is based on
comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers in two countries.
Direct Contracting (DC) will be used for proprietary items, for reasons of compatibility
and standardization, which would include contracts for: (i) equipment proprietary to
process design; (ii) equipment requiring compatibility with existing units; and (iii) where
replacement of power plant or substations components would be required, to assure
adequate fit with existing equipment and/or to meet dimensional clearance restrictions.
The aggregate value for DC is about US$12.5 million (or 35 percent of the total credit).
The list of spare parts to be procured, as well as the procurement method of direct
contracting, should be reviewed and approved by IDA. Advance contracting using both a
Project Start Up Advance as well as retroactive financing is being carried out (para 38).
32.   National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will be used for the Grabovica tailrace
reconstruction civil works with an amount not to exceed US$3 million (or 9 percent of the
total credit). Simplified National Competitive Bidding (SNCB) will be used for minor
works for the rehabilitation of EPBiH's office space with an amount not to exceed US$1
million (or 3 percent of the total credit). SNCB contracts are awarded on the basis of
quotations obtained from three qualified national contractors in response to a written
invitation. National Shopping (NS) will be used for supply of basic office equipment and
furniture for the rehabilitation of EPBIH's office facilities, with an amount not to exceed
US$0.3 million (or 1 percent of the total credit). There are two qualified local consulting
firms which have the capability to carry out detailed design, procurement, construction
supervision and project management. Both firms were shortlisted and one (Electroforce)
has been competitively selected to provide consultancy services following the Bank's
guidelines. Assuming that the cofinancing will be tied, those funds should generally be
provided through turn-key contracts, which are faster disbursing and easier to monitor
than other arrangements. Turn-key contractors should be encouraged to use local labor as
much as possible, because local labor capable of doing the job is cheaper and because it
would provide much needed local employment opportunities.   The procurement
arrangements are summarized in Table 2. A detailed procurement plan and schedule are
shown in Attachment 6. 1.
G. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
33.         Power. The three Elektropfivredas would manage and implement the
project components in their respective service areas. Management of the IDA-financed
part of the project would be carried out by EPBiH, which would be responsible for
implementation, including procurement and disbursement of funds. It has the organization
and key staff required for project management. Nevertheless, to facilitate effective project
implementation on an emergency timetable, EPBiH will establish a Project Implementation
Unit (PIU), directed by the Head of Development reporting to EPBiH Management, to
carry out the reconstruction activities. The PIU would consist of Deputy Task Managers
for Hydro Power, Thermal Power, Transmission, Distribution, and Procurement and
Logistics (each assisted by a full-time coordinator responsible for day-to-day



- 15 -
implementation), and charged with coordinating, supervising and monitoring the execution
of their part of the project. A local consulting firm (Electroforce), which is able to carry
out most of the engineering services required for the generation and transmission works,
has been appointed to assist EPBiH in carrying out engineering, procurement, and project
implementation. The PIU will be assisted by international power experts. These power
experts will assist in reviewing procurement documents, coordination and supervision of
this reconstruction effort, harmonization of designs and standards, and efficient use of
resources. The PIU is also in charge of coordinating, supervising, and monitoring the
execution of the power component under the Emergency Recovery Project.

34.   EPBiH will ensure that PIU-related activities and independent functions within the
EPBiH organization are effectively integrated. While the PIU exercises control over all
project-related activities, it would receive cross support from other EPBiH units in
selected areas, such as procurement, technical support, legal matters, budgeting,
accounting, disbursement and cost control, scheduling, manpower allocation, and
operational support. The implementation of the sub-projects would be the primary
responsibility of the local generation and transmission entities, who will report to the PIU.
Replacement of transmission equipment in operation would be performed by the
transmission entities' own maintenance staff on force account, who have handled
satisfactorily similar work during the past few months. Installation of major equipment
would be done in most instances by the suppliers on a turn-key basis, using local
construction capacity as much as possible.
35.   Coal Mining. The Tuzla, Central Bosnia and Ugljevik coal mining companies will
be responsible for physical implementation of the associated coal mine rehabilitation
components.  A project manager will be appointed for each company.  Physical
implementation will be assisted by highly skilled technicians from the manufacturers of
existing equipment. International coal experts will provide procurement assistance and
logistical support and facilitate coordination between the mining companies and the
donors. The Ministry of Energy and Industry will be responsible for contracting the
technical assistance services for the sector restructuring study.
36.   The organization charts for project implementation and the implementation
schedules for the various components of the project are set out in Attachments 6.2 and
6.3.  Similar organizations for project implementation will also be established by
Elektroprivreda Herzeg Bosnia and Elektroprivreda Reupblika Srpska for implementation
of project components in their respective areas.
H. DISBURSEMENTS
37.   The IDA Credit would be disbursed against: (a) 100 percent of the expenditures
for directly imported equipment, materials and services quoted on CIF basis; (b) 100
percent of local expenditures (ex-factory cost and other items procured locally) net of
taxes; (c) 100 percent of civil works net of taxes; and (d) 100 percent of expenditures for
consulting services. For expenditures pertaining to all civil works contracts, for contracts
for goods worth less than US$1 million and for consultants' services worth less than
$300,000 (except for individual consultant contracts for which the threshold would be
US$50,000 equivalent) disbursements would be made on the basis of statements of
expenditures. Documentation supporting such expenditures would be retained in EPBiH's
and RUT's offices and made available for review by IDA supervision missions. To
facilitate disbui sement under this project, four Special Accounts (one each for the
Government, EPBiH, RUT and for the District Heating component) in US dollars will be
established in the name of the Ministry of Finance in a commercial bank, to be maintained
and operated under conditions acceptable to IDA. The authorization allocation of the
Special Accounts will be limited to US$6.0 million equivalent (US$0.5, US$3.5, US$1.0,



- 18 -
and US$1.0 million, respectively), representing about four months (average) of IDA's
share of estimated expenditures expected to be paid from the Special Accounts.
Replenishment applications should be submitted monthly, and must include reconciled
bank statements, as well as other appropriate documents.
38.   Attachment 7 presents the disbursement schedule for the proposed IDA Credit.
IDA's standard disbursement profile would not be observed since this is a two-year
emergency project; most of the contracts would be placed in 1996 and early 1997 and
delivery would be completed in 1997. A US$3.8 million Project Start-up Advance (PSA)
for this project as well as a PSA for the proposed Emergency District Heating
Reconstruction Project (US$5.3 million) and for the proposed Emergency Gas System
Reconstruction Project (US$6.0 million) were approved by the Board of Executive
Directors on March 27, 1996. The PSA has been applied to project preparation and start-
up activities. PSAs for this and the other two projects were necessary because no other
funds were available to launch reconstruction operations. The PSAs are advanced against
the Emergency District Heating Reconstruction Project's US$20 million Credit from the
TFBH. To ensure that the full US$20 million will be available for district heating, the
proposed Emergency Electric Power Reconstruction Project and the Emergency Gas
System Reconstruction Project will contain components for the Emergency District
Heating Reconstruction Project and, after Board approval and effectiveness, these
components will be financed from the Credits for these projects. In addition to the PSA,
IDA would provide retroactive financing of up to 10% of its credit amount (US$3.5
million) for advance procurement, because the Power Project's PSA was significantly
smaller than the PSAs provided for the District Heating and the Gas projects. The credit
would be disbursed over a period of about two and a half years. The project completion
date would be June 30, 1998, and the closing date would be December 31, 1998.
1. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
39.   In accordance with OD 4.01 this project has been rated environmental "Category
B." This category is reserved for projects which may have relatively mninor adverse
environmental impacts, despite the fact that the project would result in a net reduction in
air pollution. An Environmental Management Plan (EMP) has been prepared with and
agreed to by EPBiH (Attachment 8). The project has been designed to include all
mitigation and monitoring recommended in the EMP. In general, the reconstruction
program will seek to improve the environmental impact of the components to be
reconstructed.
40.   Kakanj Cogeneration Plant.  The following are the principal environmental
concems in connection with the Kakanj plant:
Air Oualitv. The plant burns mostly brown coal with a 2% sulfur content. The
electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) are performing at an efficiency well below their
design level. They were designed to meet a standard of 500 mg/m and should be
rehabilitated to their original specified (design) performance capability. The S02



- 19 -
emissions could produce significant air quality impacts due to the poor quality
(combination of heating value, ash, and sulfur) of fuel from the Kakanj Mine and
the high terrain near the facility. To reduce S02 impacts the 4 x 32 MW units will
be phased-out after the year 2000. Another option to consider for the plant's
future rehabilitation for reducing S02 impacts may be to vent the 4 x 32 MW units
into the 300 meter stack to which the 2 x 110 MW units are currently connected.
Water Quality. A new wastewater treatment plant for this station is currently not
operating, and the completion and operation of this treatment plant should be
considered in the future.
Ash Disposal. Ash is transported by conveyor and dumped off a sheer cliff over a
drop of approximately 60 meters. No drinking water sources are near the ash
disposal site. The ash pile would be reclaimed (i.e., covered with soil/vegetation),
the drop height minimized and the ash wetted to reduce dusting.
Oil Storage Tanks. The station has three above ground oil storage tanks and two
underground tanks. Above ground tanks are surrounded by a berm and are
installed on a concrete pad. Since there are no sources of drinking water near the
underground tanks, the only required action should be to monitor the tanks for
leakage.
Fuel Handling and Storage. The coal is transported by truck to a crushing area at
the mine and is then transported by conveyor belt to the plant. The conveyor belts
are totally enclosed. Consideration should be given to reduce dusting from truck
transport of fuel (e.g., cover trucks, minimize material disposal heights).
41.   Tuzla Cogeneration Plant.  The following are the principal environmental
concerns in connection with the Tuzla Plant:
Air Quality. No maintenance or replacement of components in the ESPs has
occurred since the startup of these units in the early 1970s. They should be
rehabilitated to their original (design) performance.
Sulfur Dioxide. The plant burns mostly lignite with a 0.5% sulfur content. The
sulfur dioxide impacts caused by emissions from the station were evaluated since a
aerodynamic downwash situation had been identified and included in the mitigation
plan. An air quality impact analysis indicated that ambient levels of SO2 would be
more than 60 micrograms/Nm3 (annual average) higher and dust levels 32
micrograms/Nm3 (annual average) higher without the project, because people
would use the poor quality fuel in individual heaters rather than rely on the
cogeneration plant.
Water Quality. Water for plant use is supplied from a lake 10 kilometers from the
plant. Wastewaters are all discharged directly to the river without treatment.
Waste oil and plant lubricants are fed into the boilers as a disposal method.



- 20 -
Wastewater streams from the station should be tested to determine the need for
water treatment facilities.
Ash Disposal. Ash is transported in a slurry to several disposal areas in the hills
approximately 5 kilometers away. No drinking water supply is near the disposal
areas.
Oil Storage Tanks. Above ground oil storage tanks are surrounded by berms and
are installed on an impervious pad. There are four underground oil storage tanks.
Since there are no sources of drinking water near the underground tanks, the only
required action should be to monitor the tanks for leakage.
Asbestos and PCBs. Asbestos is present on cooling tower plates and boiler house
insulation.  This material should be inspected for deterioration.  No Poly-
Chlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) are used in transformers at the station nor anywhere
in the system according to EPBiH.
Fuel Handling and Storage. Some minor dusting is likely from truck delivery of
fuel, storage of fuel, and fuel handling.  Simple control measures can be
implemented to reduce dusting (e.g., cover trucks and minimize drop height when
transferring fuel).
42.   Transmission Facilities. Transmission line corridors and substation sites were in
place before the war and their rehabilitation will not involve new routing or disturb new
areas. No new environmental impacts are anticipated.
43.   Hydroelectric Facilities. The Jablanica and Grabovica hydroelectric plants were
in service before the war and therefore no new environmental impacts will be caused by
their rehabilitation.
44.   Associated Coal Mines. Key environmental issues associated with the coal mines
rehabilitation are with utilization rather than with mining. In particular, the high sulfur and
ash content of brown coal is a concern for future development of thermal power and will
impact future mine development.   Concerning  surface coal mining, the major
environmental issue is use and disturbance of land. As mining will take place in existing
mnining areas, will not use and disturb additional land, and in view of the emergency
character of the project, no environmental mitigation measures other than prudent
engineering and operational practices are deemed necessary now. However, for any future
expansion of mining activities, appropriate approval and mitigation enforcement
procedures would need to be followed. Environmental acceptability will be an important
criterion for selection of a development strategy, and terms of reference for consulting
services to assist in coal sector restructuring (para 16) would include environmental
aspects as a component. Furthermore, as part of the technical assistance to be provided
for project implementation, advice would be obtained on the use of new mining equipment
in order to reduce potential environmental impacts.

J. AccouNTs, AUDITING AND REPORTING
45.   Separate and auditable accounts would be established by EPBiH and RUT. These
accounts would include: (i) a record of withdrawals on the IDA Credit with copies of all
disbursement requests and underlying documentation; and (ii) a record of transactions on
the Special Accounts and the copies of the bank statements on this account. Technical
assistance has been included under the project to establish proper accounts and financial
controlling procedures.
46.   The financial statements of the Beneficiaries and the project accounts would be
audited annually by independent auditors under terms of reference acceptable to IDA.
Separate audit statements would be prepared for the Special Accounts and for Statements
of Expenditures. All audit reports would be made available to IDA at the latest six
months after the end of the fiscal year. Project accounts would be maintained for one year
after they have been audited. The Beneficiaries will separately prepare and furnish to IDA
quarterly progress reports showing the status of implementation of the project as well as a
financial report in a format acceptable to IDA.
K. SUPERVISION PLAN
47.   Project implementation will require intensive IDA staff involvement, especially
during the first 12 months of implementation and will require a high degree of flexibility in
view of the need to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances. Implementation progress
would be formally evaluated approximately 12 months after effectiveness, when project
implementation should be in full swing. In addition, the Resident Mission in Sarajevo
would assist in supervising initial project implementation and would assist closely on
matters requiring advice and rapid decisions by IDA, such as procurement and
disbursements.
IV. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS
A. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
1. Past Performance and Current Situation
48.   EPBiH's financial statements, including forecasts up to the year 2000, are
presented in Attachment 9. Evaluation of its financial performance has to be approached
with caution due to the disruptions in data collection and accounting systems during the
war years, and the absence of audited accounts. In 1994 and 1995, EPBiH is estimated to
have incurred losses equivalent to about US$40 and US$78 million, respectively.



- 22 -
Electricity sales in 1995, at 1,173 million kWh, were far below the peak levels reached in
1989 (when BH as a whole consumed about 11,700 milllion kWh). Furthermore, due to
the financial difficulties faced by households and corporate consumers during these years,
collection rates were very low, although collection performance improved substantially in
1995 to reach around 50% of cash operating expenses
49.   Cost Structure. Fuel (coal and oil) costs account for around 25% of EPBiH's
total operating expenses. EPBiH purchases its coal from domestic coal mines; costs per
gigajoule are high in relation to international standards but are expected to improve when
the coal mines are restructured. Operating and maintenance costs are at acceptable levels,
however, this is aided by the depressed levels of wages and salaries as well as the lower
than normal staff level. Depreciation charges have been only about 1.5% of gross fixed
assets during the war period; they will need to be increased to appropriate levels (at least
2.5% on average) and be reflected in the electricity prices, so that EPBiH can internally
generate adequate amounts of funds necessary for normal levels of investments and
operations.
50.   Tariffs. Considering the difficult situation in the war period, tariffs were
maintained at fairly high levels of about US$0.052 per kWh on average in 1995.
However, these levels do not fully cover costs. Moreover, the structure is distorted in
favor of households who, at only about US$0.024 per kWh, are charged far less than the
full cost of providing electricity; this encourages uneconomic use, including for space
heatinig. On the other hand, industries and high voltage users pay a tariff that may exceed
the effective cost.  Therefore, the tariff structure should be revised to reflect the
differentials in supply costs for different groups of customers. EPBiH should consider
introducing an interim tariff of about US$0.057 per kWh for consumption in excess of 150
kWh per month per household starting in 1997, in order to discourage space heating with
electricity, as opposed to with district heating or gas. Furthermore, tariff levels in general
would need to be raised progressively, first to permit adequate internal generation of funds
to cover EPBiH's expenditures and provide modest cash balances, and later to provide full
cost coverage as EPBiH undertakes further necessary efficiency-improving investments.
51.   Metering, Billing and Collection. Many households are not metered, and are
billed on the basis of estimated consumption. Large numbers of meters are needed,
essentially for households and small industries, which would be financed under the
distribution component of the proposed project (para 24). As a result of inadequate
metering as well as the impact of the war on consumers' finances, the collection rate as a
percent of billing dropped from 80% in 1991 to about 50% in 1995, ranging from near-
zero in the war-torn areas to close to the pre-war level in non- affected areas. This
collection performance can be expected to improve as meters are installed and the
authority of EPBiH agents in war-ravaged areas is restored.
52.   Receivables and Payables.  As of December 1995, receivables were about
US$66 million equivalent. Most receivables are due from entities depending on the
Government budget: municipal organizations, health institutes, schools, heating plants, and
urban transport enterprises. Regarding payables (US$70 million), the main creditors are



- 23 -
the coal mines. EPBiH's outstanding long term debt is about US$230 million equivalent,
to which should be added the interest arrears accumulated since 1992 (about US$70
million on the outstanding IBRD loan amount of US$186 million alone).
2. Future Financial Performance
53.   EPBiH projects electricity sales to increase from 1,173 million kWh in 1995 to
about 3,700 million kWh in the year 2000. At these levels, electricity consumption would
remain far below the pre-war levels. At the same time, EPBiH's current tariff levels do
not even cover its cash operating expenses, resulting in further increases in its
indebtedness to suppliers. Therefore, as a first step, it is assumed that EPBiH would raise
its average tariff from the current level of about 5.4 cents per kWh to 6 cents per kWh
starting at the beginning of 1997, and maintain it at least at this level during the next few
years. Given the continuing financial difficulties faced by many of its customers, EPBiH
can expect to achieve only gradually full cost recovery. The collection rate (as a percent
of annual cash operating expenses) is expected to improve from about 50% in 1995 to at
least 60% in 1996, 90% in 1997, and 100% in 1998, in accordance with the targets agreed
with EPBiH.
54.   In addition to the above tariff and billing and collection measures, EPBiH
management would need to take steps to start improving the enterprise's productivity.
Since employment is expected to increase from the low present levels as staff returns from
the army, management would need to keep close control over labor costs, with wage and
salary increases not outstripping improvements in the enterprise's financial situation.
Total employment is therefore projected to increase by not more than 50 percent by the
year 2000, and wage and salary rates in 1996 and 1997 by not more than 12 and 25
percent, respectively, over the 1995 levels.
55.   Debt service on EPBiH's accumulated past debt and interest arrears have not been
taken into account in the financial forecasts pending a resolution of this issue. The State
Government recently received a Debt Consolidation Loan from the Bank, covering inter
alia the debt of EPBiH to the Bank. It is not known whether the State Government will
ask EPBiH to repay all or part of its past debts, or whether the State will assume the debt
repayment burden.
56.   With the assumed modest increase in average tariffs starting in 1997, and the cost
recovery and collection levels which are deemed to be the maximum achievable, EPBiH's
internal cash generation is projected to remain negative in 1996. However, thereafter
EPBiH should be able to at least break even in 1997 and reach by 1999 a modest positive
cash flow of about US$25 million per year, to be applied to the many alternative claims of
essential investments, reductions in payables, debt service, and the like.

B. ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION
1. Demand Forecast
58.   Projections of the demand for electricity in Bosnia are highly speculative at present
because of uncertainties over future political and economic developments. However, they
are needed in order to evaluate investment requirements. EPBiH has prepared projections
making imaginative use of available information'. From an analysis of differences between
patterns of seasonal variation in demand before and after the war and the fact that
electricity rationing is relatively small during the summer, it has been estimated that
demand in 1995 would have been about 30% higher than the actual if there had not been
load shedding. New demand sparked by expected increases in economic activity will soon
add to the total. EPBiH projects total demand to return to within 90% of prewar demand
by the year 2000. Its base projection for the area served by the company as of February
1996 assumes that the total number of households served will increase from 450,000 in
1995 to 616,000 by 2000 and average household consumption will be 8 kWh per day (the
prewar level). Household sales would be 48% of total electricity sales by the distribution
entities. This is higher than the 40% experienced before the war, since industrial sales are
1  EPBiH accounts for almost 50% of installed generating capacity in BH and for 41% of the country's
total electricity generation in 1994.



- 25 -
not expected to fully recover, and increased demand by the service sector would not make
up for the industrial shortfall. Sales to EPBiH's direct industrial consumers were forecast
individually on the basis of specific information about the companies. Sales to these
companies are projected to grow to 720 GWh by 2000 compared to 60 GWh in 1995 and
1,083 GWh in 1990. Total electricity consumption within the territory served by EPBiH is
projected to increase by 150% from 1995 to 1998. Forecast electricity balances are
shown in Attachment 10. While EPBiH's forecast is plausible, account needs to be taken
of possibly slower growth in demand based on the possibility that the economy will not
return to the pre-war level until some time after the year 2000. The power investment
program would, in any event, increase supply by considerably less than the likely demand
increase. It would raise net power generation to only 38% of the 1990 level.
2. Benefits
59.  'T'he total estimated cost for the proposed project is about US$196 million, of
which about US$144 million (including the coal investments) is an integral part of the
1996-98 investment program applicable to the area served by EPBiH. In addition, the
program includes power investments under the Emergency Recovery Project (US$17
million). The economic analysis was carried out based on the whole investment program.
60.   The project is an integral part of the overall reconstruction program and its
absence would create a major bottleneck because the power system is already greatly
overloaded and most forms of economic activity depend on electricity. Frequent power
interruptions stop industrial processes, trams and trolley buses, computers, fax machines,
elevators, lighting, cooking and critical hospital activities. The proposed investments
would repair much of the damaged equipment in the power sector and permit the return to
operation of undamaged equipment by providing linkage. The additional power supply
(Attachment 11) would permit EPBiH to eliminate currently unmet demand estimated at
30% and satisfy one-half of the additional demand which is expected to occur up to 1998
as the economy revives. The additional power would allow a return to acceptable levels
of electricity service to households and other end-use consumers who have suffered
through numerous and prolonged blackouts and brownouts since the beginning of
hostilities. It would also forestall any tendency for industries and others to install costly
backup generators. The additional power supply, combined with the resumption of full
operation of the economy, would provide much needed revenue to the power sector.
61.   The coal mine rehabilitation component under this project will enable the thermal
power plants to resume the use of the domestic fuels for which they were designed and
supply cogenerated heat to the district heating systems of Tuzla and Zenica.  The
estimated per unit cost of additional coal supplied from these mines (US$0.028/kWh
generated) is less than the estimated cost of imported coal (US$0.039).



- 26 -
3. Economic Rate of Return Calculation
62.   Benefits were estimated as the revenue from the additional electricity sold, valued
at the average tariff rate of US$0.054 applicable as of February 1996. The estimates
reflect willingness to pay by consumers from 1999 on. During the transition period it is
assumed that Government and/or donors would pay part of the electricity costs because of
the temporarily low incomes of consumers. The costs include: the proposed investments,
operation and maintenance costs, and fuel costs for additional thermal power generation at
Tuzia and Kakanj. Import duties were excluded. Fuel costs were calculated using the
incremental operating and maintenance cost of coal mines to be rehabilitated under the
coal component of the proposed project.
63.   The internal economic rate of return was estimated to be 33%, which is
satisfactory. It underestimates the true economic rate of return since many consumers
would be willing to pay more than the current price rather than do without electricity, as
demonstrated by their use of costly back-up generators. The results are very robust. The
changes needed to reduce the rate of return to 12% are: 30% lower revenue collection, or
90% higher investment costs, or a 5 year delay in benefits after investments are made. The
detailed results for the base case are in Attachment 12.
4. Risks
64.   There are significant risks associated with this project, other than a renewed
outbreak of hostilities. A general failure of economic growth to resume would have wide-
ranging implications, inter alia on the consumers' ability to pay. The resulting operating
deficits would either have to be funded by the Government budget and donors, or services
would have to be drastically cut back. The financial risk of EPBiH having inadequate cash
flow is being addressed by the project's emphasis on speedy reintroduction of billing and
collection systems in areas where this was not done during the war and by agreeing on
specific minimum targets for collections on an annual basis. A tariff study would be
implemented and, over the longer term, tariffs ought to reflect costs in order to ensure
adequate enterprise cash flow to maintain and expand the system. Although any remaining
cash deficits might affect operation and maintenance of the system, repairing it now would
still cost significantly less than repairing it later, assuming that minimal maintenance will be
provided.  Project cost overruns are possible, despite the inclusion of a 10% physical
contingency, if the damage in certain areas turns out to be more severe than expected.
Implementation delays might occur because of unexpected technical complications and
because of a possible multiplicity of procurement procedures, depending on the number of
donors and international financial institutions involved. The latter risk is manageable,
because international experts will assist EPBiH in procurement and project
implementation. The risk of the project's financing plan remaining incomplete (financing
gap) has been mitigated by the design of the project, with part or all of the thermal power
plants and coal mine rehabilitation to be deferred as required to meet the level of financial
resources.

EMERGENCY ELECTRIC POWER RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
Project Description: Electric Power
1.    The primary objective of the project is to carry out emergency reconstruction in order
to improve the overall standard and reliability of the electric power service provided by the
EPBiH power system and to reduce the occurrence of power system outages through
reinforcement, rehabilitation, repair and maintenance of the most critical existing power system
facilities. The project seeks to assist in reconstruction, rehabilitation and maintenance of the
most urgently needed generation plants and transmission facilities through the provision of
equipment, materials, parts and services for plants and facilities located in various parts of the
system, particularly in the Tuzla, Zenica, Bihac, Mostar, Sarajevo and Banja Luka areas.
2.    Upon completion of the project, the subject plants and facilities will be in sound and safe
condition to provide a reliable basic electricity supply service for the above-mentioned major
cities and their environs. Without the project, a further deterioration in electric power service
with more power supply interruptions and load shedding can be expected.
3.    The scope of the physical project components consists of:
(i)   Jablanica Hydro Power Station (US$6.5 million): The power station is located
on the Neretva River. It is one of the major power plants in the EPBiH system,
with an installed capacity of 150 MW (6x25 MW), and was constructed in the
1950s. The availability of five out of the six units at this station has declined
significantly during the war. Among the five units, four units (4x25 MW) have
deteriorated extensively and need urgent overhaul. The rehabilitation would
include repair of the generators' winding, cooling and brake system, overhaul of
turbine runners, wicket gates, and regulators, and refurbishment of 110 kV
switchgear, control and protection, measuring and signalling equipment. The
units would be restored to normal operating condition.
(ii)   Grabovica Hydro Power Station (US$2.7 million): The power station is located
downstream (about 37 km from Mostar) of the Jablanica power station on the
Neretva River, with an installed capacity of 114 MW (2x57 MW). Rehabilitation
of this station's damaged tailrace is of prime importance. Tailrace failure can
well cause loss of the entire output of the plant. Without reinforcement of the
retaining wall and tailrace embankment, the failure is likely to be disastrous. The
emergency civil works would include:  (i) reinforcement of stilling basin,
retaining wall, and tailrace embankment; and (ii) dredging of the tailrace channel.
(iii)  Mostar Hydro Power Station (US$12.2 million): The power station is located
downstream (about 6 km from Mostar) of the Salakovac power station on the



Attachment I
Page 2 of 5
Neretva River, with an installed capacity of 75 MW (3 x 25 MW). Due to heavy
shelling the power station was badly damaged and the machine hall flooded. The
generators have been completely submerged for the last three years and have to
be lifted out for cleaning and corrosion damage inspection. Sensitive control and
regulation equipment has been completely damaged and stolen and must be
replaced. The rehabilitation work would include: (i) preliminary works and
spillway rehabilitation; (ii) rehabilitation of generators/turbines; (iii) rehabilitation
of electric, measuring and control systems; and (iv) rehabilitation of auxiliary
equipment.
(iv)  Jajce I Hydro Power Station (US$0.9 million): The rehabilitation would include:
(i) rehabilitation of 2 x 25 MW generator; (ii) replacement of turbine parts and
drainage pumps; and (iii) repair of turbine governors and auxiliary
electromechanical equipment.
(v)   Tuzla Coal-Fired Combined Heat and Power Plant (US$9.2 million): This power
plant, which suffered direct damage during the war, consists of 6 units with a
total installed capacity of 779 MW. The one 100 MW is heat and power
cogeneration unit, which provides hot water for the heating of 16,000 dwelling
units. Rehabilitation of this district heating capacity has priority. The project
will supply all equipment, materials and spare parts to carry out the urgent repair
of this cogeneration unit. Rehabilitation work would include the steam generator
plant, turbine plant, electrical equipment, measuring and control systems,
auxiliary equipment, and refurbish and upgrading of the electrostatic precipitators
and environmental monitoring equipment. It is expected that the unit would be
able to provide reliable continuous service for another eight to nine years after
rehabilitation.
(vi)  Kakani Coal-Fired Combined Heat and Power Plant (US$12.6 million): The
power plant is located about 45 km north-west of Sarajevo, consists of 7 units,
with a total capacity of 578 MW. The two 110 MW units are cogeneration units,
which supply power to the grid and supply district heat to the town of Kakanj.
The condition of the units is marginal due to the war as well as prolonged periods
of little or no maintenance. Urgent rehabilitation is required. Rehabilitation
works would include steam generator plant, turbine plant, electrical equipment,
measuring and control systems, auxiliary equipment, and refurbishing and
upgrading of the electrostatic precipitators and environmental monitoring
equipment. After rehabilitation the units would be able to provide reliable
continuous service for another eight to nine years.
(vii) Ugljevik Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant (US$1.4 million): Rehabilitation and
maintenance of the 1 x 300 MW unit and its auxiliary equipment.



Attachment 1
Page 3 of 5
(viii) Transmission Lines (US$16.9 million) and Substations (US$12.7 million): The
rehabilitation of the transmission facilities must be given top priority, since the
transmission lines and substations have been repeatedly attacked and heavily
damaged during the war.  Mine clearing will be carried out prior to the
commencement of reconstruction works. The scope of rehabilitation are listed in
Tables 1 and 2.
(ix)   Communication and System Control (US$3.7 million): The system control and
communication system has been extensively damaged. To regain control of the
power system and operate it efficiently, the microwave link Sarajevo-Kakanj has
to be urgently repaired and the supply and installation of a mainframe computer
at the Sarajevo Load Dispatch Center is required. Software and training would
be included in the contract for the mainframe computer.
(x)   Distribution Networks (US$55.8 million): The most urgent reconstruction needs
of distribution networks are in the districts of Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, Mostar,
Doboj, Bihac, Grahovo, G. Vakuf, Maglaj, Banja Luka, Bijeljna, Pale, Trebinje,
Gorazde, Foca, Kopaci, Glamoc and Jajce. The required equipment consists of
standard 35 kV, 20 kV, 10 kV and 0.4 kV distribution equipment, and ripple
control system and communications, plus consumer connections, poles, and
meters.
(xi)   Maintenance Vehicles (6.8 million). Most of EPBiH's service vehicles were
damaged during the war. The project would provide a bare minimum of 119
vehicles with which EPBiH will be able to operate and carry out necessary
maintenance. The list of vehicles is provided in Note A.
(xii)  Spare Parts (US$12.5 million). The spare parts to be ordered are primarily for
maintenance of existing thermal power plants and for the transmission system.
This includes the reestablishment of sufficient stock levels with a minimum
inventory level of two years at the time of project completion.
4.    The technical assistance component is described in adequate detail in para 24 (j) of the
main text of the Technical Annex.

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
EMERGENCY ELECTRIC POWER RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
Project Description: Associated Coal Mines
1.    The objective of the emergency rehabilitation program for coal mines associated with the
Tuzla and Kakanj thermal power plants is to ensure critical coal supply from the most efficient
mines (Dubrave, Sikylje and Banovici surface mines, and Mramor underground mine at Tuzla;
and Vrtliste surface mine, as well as Breza underground mine at Kakanj), in line with the fuel
needs of the Tuzla and Kakanj power plants. Equipment of the Ugljevik coal mine will also be
repaired to ensure coal supply for the Ugljevik thermal power plant.
2.    The rehabilitation works consist of the following:
(i) Materials, small equipment and services (US$10.2 inmillion). These supplies and services
are needed to boost production from mines which are in good operational condition and
have readily accessible coal reserves for low-cost exploitation. The supplies and services
are most critical for achievement of required output increases. The materials include:
(i) consumable materials such as tires, conveyor belts, cables, and spare parts for existing
equipment; (ii) replacement of key equipment items damaged beyond repair; and (iii)
small auxiliary equipment necessary for the operation or maintenance of existing main
production equipment in good condition. The services include the contracted overhaul
of major production equipment which can significantly increase coal output in a low-cost
manner.
(ii) Replacement Investments (US$6.0 million). Generally, investments are to be avoided in
the first-year of emergency rehabilitation work. The exception is the Vrtliste surface
mine at Kakanj because: (i) this is evidently the lowest cost, nearest and largest coal
resource for the Kakanj power plant; (ii) the existing equipment is damaged and
cannibalized beyond repair; and (iii) the relatively small investment in this mine is
enough to secure a minimum low-cost coal supply to the Kakanj power plant in the
medium/long-term. The replacement investments for the Vrtliste mine cover a small
fleet of mobile mining equipment capable of achieving the required coal production
increase in the medium-term, when the overburden/coal ratio can be kept at about 3. To
maintain the output with increasing overburden ratios, additional equipment would have
to be added in the longer term.
(iii) Technical Assistance (US$0.8 million). Consultants services are required to the Ministry
of Energy and Industry in preparing a restructuring plan for the coal sector. A review
of all operations of the coal companies will be undertaken to develop a strategy for their
adjustment or development and provide a basis for future investment decisions. The
review would be carried out jointly by local experts and experienced foreign consultants,
based on terms of reference agreed with the Bank.

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
EMERGENCY ELECTRIC POWER RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT
Project Description: Procurement Monitoring and Audit Unit
A. Objectives
1.    The Government of BH, with the assistance of the international community, is
implementing its Emergency Reconstruction Program estimated to amount to about
US$5. I billion over the next three to four years. About US$1.8 billion have been pledged
in 1996 and contracts for an estimated US$1.5 billion are expected to be let during this
first year of the Program. By June 30, 1996 the World Bank Board of Directors would
have approved US$160 million and by September 30, 1996 another US$171 million would
be approved bringing the total World Bank commitments to US$331 million by September
30, 1996. These amounts would finance a total of sixteen projects across the key sectors
of the economy.
2.    To respond to the emergency needs of the country in a timely and efficient manner,
the Bank has adopted procurement procedures which allow the required speed and enable
rapid impact on post war reconstruction. These streamlined procedures are within the
framework of the procurement guidelines for goods, works, and use of consultants
services which apply to all Bank/IDA financed projects. To optimize the benefits to the
country and their intended beneficiaries, and to promote mobilization of additional
resources from abroad, the objectives of efficiency and economy should be adhered to at
all times. This objective would be achieved by the creation of a procurement monitoring
and auditing unit (PMAU) that ensures transparency of procurement process in all
Government executed projects. This has become all the more necessary because of the
absence of such mechanism in the country.
3.    To promote good governance practices, particularly in the use of public resources,
enhance fiscal responsibility and public accountability, Government would need to
establish a procurement monitoring and auditing system to serve all public transactions
regardless of the source of their financing. This function would be assigned to an
institution to be created by an Act of Parliament and reporting to it.
4.    Because of the urgency of establishing an effective and well functioning system as
soon as possible, an interim arrangement for one year, starting September 1, 1996 would
entrust the procurement monitoring and auditing function to an experienced and reputable
international firm, selected on a competitive basis and on terms of reference acceptable to
the Bank. The firm will have access, at all time, to all records and accounts of institutions
participating in procurement of goods and services under emergency reconstruction



Attachment 2.2
Page 2 of 3
projects and programs financed or administered by the Bank/IDA. It is expected to
provide, in addition to the monitoring and normal audit of procurement transactions, the
design of monitoring and auditing systems and to extend necessary training to the staff of
the institution to be entrusted with this function throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina after
September 1997. The Government is expected to designate formally such a PMAU not
later than October 31,1996.
B. Tasks of the PMAU
5.    The selected firm  of consultants would carry out essentially the following
procurement monitoring and auditing tasks:
*     Monitoring of at least one full cycle of procurement and disbursement
transactions carried-out by each executing agency (PIU) for Bank/IDA financed or
administered projects.  The selection of the transactions at their different stages of
processing would be made randomly. The procurement monitoring will consist of an
assessment of methods and practices used by the executing agency concerned in procuring
goods and services. It will ensure that they are in line with the procurement policies and
procedures agreed to in the credit agreement and they are reflected adequately in the
tender documents issued and contracting practices of the executing agency. Monitoring of
additional contracts or steps of processing for the same project will be necessary only in
cases of observed important deficiencies in procurement practices.
*     Ex-post annual procurement audits will be carried-out for all projects
financed by the Bank up-to September 1, 1996. About 16 projects are expected to be
approved by such date and an estimated 600 contracts will be let under these projects by
September 30, 1997, about one third of this number will be under processing by
September 30, 1996.
*     Specific audits will be prepared as requested by Government or by the
World Bank as needed. It is expected that not more than four to five such specific audits
will be requested by the end of the contract period.
*     Submit findings according to pre-agreed time table to the head of the
executing agency, the government and the Bank for all the audits referred to above and
according to pre-agreed schedule, including recommendations for improvements or
adjustments.
*     Design a monitoring and auditing system with appropriate policies and
procedures to be applied to all government financed projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina
territory.
*     Provide necessary training to a core staff to take over the full procurement
auditing function by September 1997.

C. Supporting Documentation
6.          In carrying out its monitoring and auditing tasks, the firm will refer, but not
exclusively, to the following key documentation related, inter alia, to the World Bank
Procurement Guidelines of January 1996 and Guidelines on Use of Consultants of August
1981; the Project or Program Credit and related Subsidiary Agreements; the Technical
Annex; the letter of invitation; the tender documents; the bidding documents; the bid
evaluation report; the contract and the purchase order; the letter of credit; the suppliers'
invoice and certificate of origin; the import documents and inspection certificates; any
other evidence of receipt of goods or services; the authorization of payment; the evidence
of payment; and the accounting records of approval, disbursements, and balance available.
D. Audit Scope and Staffing
7.    On the basis of the documentation indicated above, the PMAU will evaluate the
effectiveness of controls (segregation of functions and duties between initiation of
transaction, authorization, disbursement, and recording) and accuracy of documentation
presented. It will ascertain that all actions are properly authorized and approved,
contracting effected according to agreements, and expenditures eligible for Bank/IDA
financing and disbursement. The audit will confirm, as appropriate, the physical existence
of significant items procured.
8.    About 36 foreign expert-months are expected to be needed for the tasks outlined
above. They will be assisted by about ten local experts to constitute the core staff of the
PMAU to be created not later than October 31, 1996.
9.    During their one year contract, the selected international experts are expected to
devote about 60% of their time to project procurement auditing; 30 % to procurement
monitoring and 10% to designing the system's policies and procedures and providing
necessary training to the PMAU's staff. The project component is expected to cost about
US$1.2 million, of which about 50% would be in foreign currencies.

IRR  =  33%
Investment: Emergency Recovery Project plus Emergency Reconstruction Project
-  0 & M: 3% of cumulated investments per year.
- Fuel: operating cost for incremental coal production of 562,000 tons in 1997 and 966,000 tons in 1998 and
thereafter, assumed equal to 50% of 1995 operating cost per ton for production at Tuzla.
- Revenue: assumes 1995 average tariff rate of US$0.054/kWh, increased sales over 1995 level equal to increased
generation attributable to the investments of 100 GWh in 1996, 1,083 GWh in 1997, and 1,463 GWh in 1998,
less 17% transmission and distribution losses (14% from 1999).
Revenue falls after 2000 due to ending of generation from 32 MW coal-fired units and after 2005 due to ending
of 100/1 10 MW rehabilitated units at Tuzla and Kakanj.
