                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Education for All Fast-Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Catalytic Fund (CF) Project (Project) now called the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) for the Republic of The Gambia was
                         approved on July 31, 2009. The Grant Letter Agreement (TF094961) was signed on August 6, 2009 and the project became simultaneously effective. The Project's performance has
                         been rated Satisfactory with regard to PDO achievement and Implementation Progress. The project was restructured in December 2012 to better align the project indicators with the
                         project activities and the new population data projection. On June 20 2013, the government requested a three month extension from June 30 to September 30 2013 due to the delay
                         of the textbook delivery, which was approved. This is the last ISR as the project closes on September 30, 2013.

                         The grant amount of US$28 million has been fully disbursed (100% disbursement). Most of the activities were implemented satisfactorily. However, some textbooks and teachers'
                         guides of grades 5-6 and grades 7-9 have not yet arrived in The Gambia although they were shipped out early August. The last batch is expected to arrive in The Gambia on
                         September 20, 2013. The task team is closely monitoring.
