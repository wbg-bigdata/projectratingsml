        THE GAMBIA EFA-FTI CATALYTIC FUND 2009-2011 PROJECT

                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER

  A. SUMMARY

1.      The proposed restructuring seeks the approval of the Regional Vice-President to
(a) revise the Project Development Objective (PDO) to reflect the activities and
objectives of this project more precisely, (b) revise the results framework to be more
specific with reliable and collectable data, and (c) extend the closing date for six months
to June 30, 2013. This is the first request for closing date extension. The proposed
restructuring has been requested by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance of the
Republic of The Gambia (“Recipient?), in a letter dated August 28, 2012.

  B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      The Education for All Fast-Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) Catalytic Fund (CF)
Project (Project) for the Republic of The Gambia was approved on July 31, 2009. The
Grant Letter Agreement (TF094961) was signed on August 6, 2009 and simultaneously
became effective. Of a total of US$28 million, 89.1 percent of the funds or
US$24,967,681 has been disbursed as of November 20, 2012. The Project’s performance
has been rated Satisfactory with regard to PDO achievement and Implementation
Performance. In addition, during the June 2012 mission, the financial management (FM)
performance of the Project was rated Satisfactory as the FM staff in place remains
adequate, the bookkeeping is updated and expenditures are justified by supporting
documents. The overall procurement arrangements of the Project were rated Moderately
Satisfactory because the bid evaluation report took three months without explanation and
the contract amount was higher than the cost estimate. As a result, the remaining
outstanding contracts will be subject to prior review to ensure that World Bank
procurement guidelines are properly followed.

3.     A proposed action plan as well as a revised implementation support plan for the
remaining time of Project implementation were discussed with and provided by the
Recipient and accepted by the Bank.

Implementation progress of Component 1: Increasing access to and equity in basic
education

4.      (i) Increase availability of useable classrooms in under-served areas:
Classroom construction: A total of 252 classrooms will be constructed, and so far 174
new classrooms have been constructed and handed over for use. The construction of the
remaining 78 classrooms and the rehabilitation of 144 classrooms and 15 staff quarters
are ongoing and will be completed in May 2013. It should be noted that the PAD
referred to 400 classrooms to be constructed. This was an error as these estimates were
based on the wrong unit costs, which were an oversight and do not represent an increase
in actual costs.

                                            1
(ii) Improve retention and completion: Designing 81 donkey carts transportation system:
All items have been delivered to respective communities.

(iii) Maintain gender parity and address inequities:
     a. Construction of toilet facilities for girls (target: 24 blocks in 18 schools): They
        have been completed and handed over for use.
     b. Provision of sanitary supplies to adolescent girls: 109,812 sanitary packets have
        been delivered to 16,000 girls for the last school term.
     c. Expand Child Friendly School (CFS) initiative in regions 2 and 3 through support
        to new and existing mothers’ clubs: Mothers’ clubs have been established and
        skills training has been conducted nationwide.
     d. Financial assistance to 3,000 needy boys: The beneficiary number increased from
        3,000 to 6,000 boys due to a higher demand. With this intervention, chances of
        these boys dropping out of the system have been fully reduced.

Implementation progress of Component 2: Improving the quality of teaching and
learning

5.      (i) Increase ratio of pupils to teachers and pupils to textbooks: The Essential
Learning Package, supplementary readers and other teaching and learning materials have
been provided. A total of 262,470 supplementary readers comprising 47 titles were
finalized in April 2012 and 135,000 copies for 28 titles have been delivered.

(ii) Enhance quality provision of special needs education:
     a. Enhance quality provision of special needs education: The procurement process
        for the purchase of equipment and other materials for hard of hearing and learning
        difficulties has been launched.
     b. Development of itinerant teaching program to support mainstreaming: The
        training of 181 madrassa teachers in all regions and the training of 36 polyvalent
        itinerant teachers have been conducted to support the mainstreaming of students
        with special needs.
     c. Training students and parents in sign language: This activity has been conducted
        in two phases covering 110 parents of students attending St. John’s School for the
        Deaf.

(iii) Increase number of qualified teachers:
     a. Improve distance learning for teacher trainees: This is ongoing through the
         Gambia College. A total of 490 copies of Distance Education materials for the
         Primary Teachers Certificate (PTC) Extension Program have been printed,
         students’ modules (Grades 1-8) have been marked, and teaching practice
         observation visits have been undertaken across regions.
     b. Provision of stipends to teacher trainees: On top of the US$11.67 monthly stipend
         provided by the Ministry of Higher Education, Research, Science & Technology
         (MoHERST) to support training fees, this Project started supporting all teacher
         trainees with a top up stipend of US$5 per trainee per month.


                                            2
(iv) Curriculum improvement:
    a. The Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program: This program is aimed at
       providing an alternative form of education with minimum curriculum standards to
       children under difficult circumstances. Such children are in the custody of
       religious leaders whose responsibility is to teach them the Holy Quran and other
       Islamic values. The condition attached to the release of the children to attend
       classes is the provision of a monthly stipend of US$3.3 per month per child to the
       custodian. The children are exposed to literacy, numeracy, life skills and
       livelihood skills. The teaching and learning materials and consumables have been
       delivered and the program is ongoing.
    b. Development of curriculum materials on non-core subjects for lower and upper
       basic schools (grades 1-9): Materials for four non-core subjects at the upper basic
       level have been developed and validated.
    c. The students in 125 schools are currently being taught reading in national
       languages for one hour a day. A baseline has been completed and an endline has
       been carried out in June 2012.

(v) Improve retention of teachers in disadvantaged communities: Provision of hardship
allowances to teachers in disadvantaged communities in Regions 3, 4, 5 and 6. 1,358
teachers (818 qualified teachers and 540 unqualified teachers) are currently receiving
allowances in these four regions. As a result of the hardship allowance and the PTC-
extension, Pupil-Qualified Teacher Ratio (PqTR) in the four regions improved much
more than in regions 1 and 2 (urban areas).

Implementation progress of Component 3: Strengthening institutional and
management capacities of central and regional directorates

6.      (i) Produce education data in a timely and accurate manner:
     a. Improve data collection, analysis and dissemination including the timely
        availability of reliable statistics each year: Annual data from schools have been
        collected and processed in Education Management Information System (EMIS).
     b. Conduct a school mapping exercise and facilities assessment survey: a school
        mapping was conducted in June 2010, in regions 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. New schools
        were identified and an approval was granted to be integrated into the formal
        public system. Based on the mapping results, classrooms are being constructed.

(ii) Improved governance of sector resources:
     a. Monitoring of assets: Assets verification and update is being conducted on a
        quarterly basis.
     b. Annual audits: The recruited external auditor completed the audit of the accounts
        for the period 2010 and a report was made available in 2011. Another audit was
        conducted in June 2012. All audits have been rated unqualified.

  C. PROPOSED CHANGES

7.      The project development objective (PDO) will be modified from “to improve the
Recipient's conditions for teaching and learning in basic education including early
childhood development, in alignment with the overall objectives of the Recipient's
Education Sector Strategy Plan 2006 and the Medium-Term Plan for 2009-2011? to
“improve the Recipient’s conditions for teaching and learning in basic education, in
alignment with the overall objectives of the Recipient’s Education Sector Strategy Plan
2006 and the Medium-term Plan for 2009-2011 ?. The exclusion of early childhood
development (ECD) stemmed from the fact that most early childhood interventions
planned under the Project are being implemented through the Japan Social Development
Fund (JSDF). It was agreed that the few activities relating to ECD supported by the
Project, including the support of ECD networks and the formulation of an ECD policy, do
not have the intensity to warrant inclusion in the development objective. The PDO was
therefore revised to reflect the interventions leading to the outcome for which the
program can reasonably be held accountable.

8.      Apart from the PDO, another significant change relates to the revision of the
results framework. Indicators were revised in order to be specific, measurable, available,
relevant and time-bound (SMART). The framework was overloaded with indicators and
in some cases repetitious ones. It was therefore necessary to identify a focused set of
indicators which draw on indicators that are regularly collected and reported by
government agencies. During this process the baseline targets were adjusted as it was
determined that the available data at the time of appraisal were not up to date. The
revised data is based on new 2003 census data projections. The task team and
Government are aware of the drop in completion rates over the years. A study assessing
the barriers to schooling (never enrolled and dropouts) will be launched in December
2012 to better understand the reasons behind these declining results.

9.      Closing date: The Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs formally requested
in a letter dated August 28, 2012, the extension of the closing date by six months from
December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013. This request was made to ensure that the
construction of the remaining 78 classrooms and rehabilitation of 144 classrooms and 15
staff quarters will be completed by the project closing date.
