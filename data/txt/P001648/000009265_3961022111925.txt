MALAWI
FISCAL RESTRUCTURING
AND DEREGULATION PROGRAM
SUMMARY
Beneficiary:       Republic of Malawi
Project Task ID:   3MAL-PA-1648
Implementing
Agency:            Government of Malawi
IDA Amount:        SDR 73.2 million (US$106.4 million equivalent) of which
SDR2.9 million (US$4.4 million) have been allocated
from IDA Reflows.
Terms:             Standard IDA Terms: 40 years maturity with a 10-year
grace period.
Co-financing:      Co-financing and parallel financing is expected from the
Government of Germany (US$7 million equivalent) and
the Government of Japan. The Governments of Denmark
and Sweden have expressed interest in supporting the
operation through quick-disbursing grants.
Disbursement:      The proposed Credit will be disbursed through the
Reserve Bank of Malawi. The initial tranche of SDR
50.9 million (US$74.4 million equivalent) including the
allocation from IDA Reflows, will be available upon
Credit effectiveness and the Second Tranche of
SDR 21 million (US$30 million equivalent) will be
disbursed when the conditions relating to civil service
reform  are met.  SDR 1.3 million (US$2 million
equivalent) is available for consultant services.
Background:       The Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation Program
(FRDP) will be the first economic reform program



Summary
designed and implemented by the new Government of
Malawi (GOM). The operation (a) is anchored in the
GOM's medium-term strategy as reflected in the
6th Policy  Framework  Paper  (PFP,  issued  on
October 10, 1995) and the attached Letter of Development
Policy (LDP); and (b) is a core component of the World
Bank Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which
is being presented to the Board in conjunction with the
proposed operation. The FRDP is supported under the
Special Program of Assistance to Low-Income Debt-
Distressed Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SPA) and the
Cross Border Initiative for Eastern and Southern Africa
(CBI).
Description:      The FRDP is designed to support a critical new phase in
Malawi's emerging macroeconomic reform program,
aimed at the dual strategy of ensuring the macroeconomic
essentials to allow growth, and a fundamental
restructuring of programs that address the country's
pervasive poverty. The cornerstone of this phase of the
program is a far-ranging overhaul of public
expenditure planning and management, with a view to
raising allocations in pro-poor expenditure categories
within agreed macroeconomic targets. Specifically, the
operation supports development of a Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF), comprehensive civil
service reform, and tax and tariff reform. In addition, the
FRDP focuses on policy measures that will allow the
poor to participate in the full range of economic
activities. This includes complete removal of remaining
pricing and marketing constraints on smallholder
agriculture, and removal of the binding constraints to
broad-based private sector entry and development.
Rationale for
IDA Involvement:  The proposed Credit represents the logical continuation of
IDA involvement in Malawi's adjustment to a difficult
external environment.   Despite a series of earlier
adjustment operations, there remains a backlog of policy
constraints which the new Government--with technical
and financial support from IDA and other donors--is
committed to removing rapidly. The proposed FRDP
supports a time-slice of Malawi's economic reform
program starting with a wide range of credible policy
measures that have been implemented over the past

12 months (including education sector policy, expenditure
reform, and agricultural liberalization). In other areas the
GOM has expressed its commitment to reform and
launched medium term initiatives--but further analytical
work needs to be carried out before specific measures are
identified. In those areas, IDA will remain engaged in
providing guidance and advice during supervision and
expects to narrow down the scope and timing of specific
measures within the next 12 to 18 months (including land
policy reform, drought proofing, and privatization).
Government
Commitment:       Critical components of the FRDP--such as the civil
service census, the privatization strategy, the measures
under the CBI, and the MTEF--were prepared by
Government. The GOM has firmly demonstrated its
commitment to policy reforms, economic growth, and
poverty alleviation and has unequivocally stated its
commitment to involving broad segments of civil society
in the planning and implementation of its development
programs. The proposed Credit will provide funds for
consultants' services to carry out stakeholder meetings to
gauge the impact of policy measures on vulnerable groups
and support a communications strategy for the proposed
measures.
Benefits:         The policy package will directly benefit the poor through
redirection of public resources towards their needs (such
as primary services in education and health) and through
reduced inflation resulting from macroeconomic
stabilization.  Improved access to cash crops and
alternative  marketing  channels  should  increase
smallholder household incomes. Exporters will gain
through   increased  incentives  for  agricultural
diversification, helping the economy to reduce its
dependency on tobacco (from currently 66% of export
revenues to about 50% by 2005) and creating additional
employment opportunities.
Risks:            The FRDP faces implementation and outcome risks. The
risk of failing in macroeconomic stabilization because of,
for instance, excessive civil service wage increases, will
be managed through continuation of bilateral negotiations
between the GOM and the Civil Servants Union. The
resolution of the August 1995 civil service strike is



iv                                                            Summary
indicative of the GOM's determination to offset higher
civil service salaries only with parallel reduction and
restructuring of the size of the civil service in the context
of civil service reform.
It is probable that civil service reform and privatization
will encounter political pressures by civil servants and
parastatal employees who will object to retrenchment
plans. Although extensive stakeholder involvement will
help reduce resistance from special interest groups (and
the GOM's communication strategy will help build broad-
based consensus), residual risks remain. These will be
managed by reaching agreement on end-of-service and
severance benefits packages.  The recently completed
staff retrenchment of Malawi Railways has set a precedent
by which future retrenchment packages in the public and
parastatal sector might be measured.
Accelerated agricultural liberalization could result in
further increases in maize prices (main staple).  This
would adversely affect food deficit households and
receive significant attention from civil society and critics
of adjustment programs--and could eventually lead to
reversal of the GOM's liberalization policy under popular
pressure. This risk will be managed through a mix of
stakeholder consultations, targeted pro-poor activities
(such as public works under the Malawi Social Action
Fund (MASAF), targeted input distribution programs, and
supplemental food programs) and sales from the Strategic
Grain Reserve (SGR).
Although the GOM's political willpower will continue to
be tested, actions taken so far clearly signal the GOM's
commitment to poverty reduction and macroeconomic
stabilization. In all policy areas, preparatory work was
carried out by the GOM and implementation of critical
measures is on track, thus reducing the risk of back-
pedalling on key issues. The aforementioned residual
implementation risks can be reduced to a level similar to
those associated with many of IDA's successful programs.
But even if Malawi does all the right things, vulnerability
to external shocks--outcome risks--will persist. The risk
of drought is by far the highest and least controllable of
such risks. In the short term, the impact of a major



Summary                                                            v
drought cannot be offset alone by shifting resources or by
relying on substantial donor grants; additional aggregate
demand management would be necessary to stay within
the agreed fiscal framework. In that case, some measures
are necessary to reduce the burden on the poor; the
MTEF will help to protect expenditure allocations in the
social sectors and will identify low-priority areas from
which to reallocate expenditures to drought-related
operations. Over the medium term--and for a limited
number of households--the agreed expansion of
smallholder tobacco production is a measure to improve
drought vulnerability. Over the longer term, the GOM
and IDA intend to address drought vulnerability through a
more systematic and integrated effort to promote
alternative crops, disseminate alternative technologies and
foster increased non-farm activities.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO SUPPORT A
FISCAL RESTRUCTURING AND DEREGULATION PROGRAM
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1    I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
International Development Association (IDA) Credit of SDR 73.2 million
(US$106.4 million equivalent) of which SDR 2.9 million have been allocated
from IDA Reflows to the Republic of Malawi in support of its economic reform
and structural adjustment program. The Credit would be on standard IDA terns
with 40 years maturity and a 10-year grace period. Co-financing is expected
from the Governments of Germany and Japan. The Governments of Denmark
and Sweden have expressed their interest to support the prograrn through quick-
disbursing grants.
1.2   This will be the first economic reform  program  designed and
implemented by Malawi's democratically-elected government, following
30 years of one-party rule. The operation is (a) anchored in the GOM's
medium-term strategy as reflected in the 6th Policy Framework Paper (PFP,
issued on October 10, 1995); and (b) a core component of the World Bank
Group's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), that is being presented to the
Board in conjunction with the proposed operation. The GOM's program is also
supported by a three-year arrangement under the IMF's Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility (ESAF approved by the IMF's Board on October 18, 1995).

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
OVERVIEW
2.1   The Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation Program (FRDP) is designed
to support a critical new phase in Malawi's continuing macroeconomic reform
program, aimed at the dual strategy of ensuring the macroeconomic essentials to
allow growth, and a fundamental restructuring of programs to ensure that these
better address the country's pervasive poverty. The Poverty Profile (prepared by
the GOM and the Bank) shows that Malawi's per capita spending in the social
sectors compares favorably with other low-income countries. However, social
sector spending is highly biased against primary level services and therefore
fails to reach broad segments of the poor. The GOM has launched a far-reaching
process to reorient public spending to pro-poor areas in line with its commitment
to expand the provision of social services to the majority of the population.
Further, the GOM has embarked on the accelerated liberalization of the economy
to achieve broader-based development and sharing in the country's wealth by
those segments of the population that were largely excluded in the past.
Consequently the proposed operation focuses on the following two policy areas
in the GOM's medium-term program:
(a)   Fiscal restructuring in favor of social sectors.
(b)   Deregulation to integrate smallholder farmers (who account for
85% of the poor) and a nascent private sector in the mainstream
of development.
2.2   Proceeds from the proposed Credit will (a) help fill Malawi's projected
external financing gap through FY96/97; (b) provide budgetary support for
critical expenditures in the social sectors and a substantial net repayment to the
domestic banking system; and (c) smooth consumption to lessen the costs of
stabilization and help prevent undue hardship to the poor.
2.3   Initially we planned to present a larger Credit with two tranches plus a
floating tranche linked to implementation of specific actions under an agreed
civil service reform program. However, in view of the breadth and complexity
of the overall reform agenda, we decided that the operation should be geared to a
shorter timeframe. An initial tranche (US$74.4 million equivalent) will
support a wide range of far-reaching policy measures which the GOM has
already taken during the past months. A smaller Second Tranche (Civil



Background and Rationale                                                   3
Service Reform Tranche equivalent to US$30 million) will be linked to
specific actions under civil service reform (to follow about 6 months after the
initial tranche). We expect continued strong commitment by the GOM and plan
to pursue specifics under the medium-term policy agenda in conjunction with
supervision of the proposed program and during preparation of a follow-on
operation which we plan to present for Board approval in FY98.
EXPERIENCE UNDER PREVIOUS ADJUSTMENT OPERATIONS
2.4    Since 1981 Malawi has undertaken six adjustment operations, including
two  supplemental Credits (Table  2.1:   Malawi - Previous Adjustment
Operations), reflecting a pattern of recurrent periods of short-lived economic
recovery and growth (as in 1983-85 and 1988-91), which were halted or reversed
by external shocks followed by economic recessions. Details on previous
Adjustment Operations are presented in Annex A. Although these repeated
periods of economic recovery earned Malawi the reputation as a "strong
adjuster", sustainable and broad-based growth has remained elusive (Figure 2.1:
Malawi - Real GDP Growth). During the early 1980s structural reforms were
pursued and designed primarily for their impact on fiscal stability, for instance,
restructuring loss-making parastatals and removing fertilizer subsidies. While
Malawi succeeded in the short run, the costs of successive stabilizations were
significant. Much of the burden of fiscal tightening was borne by the poorest
segments of the population because expenditure cuts perpetuated the imbalance
between spending on primary social services (which can benefit the poor) and
tertiary level social expenditures (which benefited a small elite). Malawi's
poverty indicators fell behind other countries that started from similar low levels
at Independence.

2.5    The pre-1994 Government's lack of commitment to poverty alleviation--
combined with Malawi's vulnerability to recurrent external shocks--forestalled
any sustained and comprehensive transformation of the economy. Until a few
years ago, Malawi's economy--in particular the smaliholder agricultural sector--



4                                                                Chapter 2
was among the most regulated private sectors in Africa. Marketing and
production restrictions excluded smallholders from growing profitable cash
crops (especially burley tobacco), from getting prices that corresponded to world
market prices, and from competing with the privileged estate sector. Until 1987
the marketing monopsony of ADMARC (Agricultural Development and
Marketing Corporation) effectively taxed the smallholder sub-sector and
prevented entry by private traders. Expanding tobacco exports provided a thin
veneer of growth (almost exclusively in the estate sector) that concealed a fragile
and narrow macroeconomic base, highly skewed income distribution, and lack

2.6    The formal sector became increasingly dominated by a few public and
private conglomerates (such as Press Corporation, ADMARC, and Malawi
Development Corporation (MDC)). Concentration of property ownership in the
economy reinforced the increasingly domineering political regime. President
Banda personally owned Press Corporation, a "private" company controlling
over half of Malawi's small formal sector, including banks, manufacturing and
agricultural estates. A small number of Malawians benefitted, while the lives of
the majority became worse.   Malawi's Gini coefficient for household
expenditures (.62) may be the highest recorded in the World (Table 2.2: Malawi
- Poverty Indicators).

2.7   By 1987 it was clear that business as usual was not going to lead to
sustained recovery. The Bank launched analytical work which pointed to the
magnitude of rural poverty, the deeply engrained economic inequalities, and the
Government's weak commitment to poverty alleviation. The first explicitly pro-
poor operation in Malawi (the 1989 Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit -
ASAC) led--after significant resistance by the past Government--to the gradual
removal of several restrictions on smallholder agriculture (including barriers to
participation by private traders, and limited smallholder access to burley).
Preparation  of the  1992  adjustment  operation--the  Entrepreneurship
Development and Drought Recovery Program (EDDRP)--coincided with the
onset of political transition and mounting internal opposition to the previous
government. The operation deepened a number of structural reforms (such as
tariff reform, further liberalization in the agricultural sector, and investment
deregulation) but became effectively a holding operation to keep the economy
on track during the severe drought of 1992 and through the process of political
transition.
ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE TO HIGHER IMPACT ADJUSTMENT
2.8   Since the 1994 political transition in Malawi, the odds for successful
structural reforms have substantially improved, especially in those areas where
Malawi compares unfavorably with other countries in the region (such as fiscal
management and pro-poor policies). In contrast to the previous regime, the new
GOM has firmly demonstrated its commitment to policy reformn and has
radically improved the approach to dealing with the country's pervasive poverty.
Major policies implemented by the new GOM are listed in Table 2.3. The
design of the proposed program takes into account the lessons learned from

previous operations (Box 2.1: Malawi - Lessons Learned from Previous
Adjustment Operations).   The  variables that contribute  to  an  environment
conducive to Higher Impact Adjustment Lending in Malawi are summarized in
Annex B: Environment for Higher Impact Adjustment Lending in Malawi.
Table 2.3: Malawi - Major Policies Implemented Since May 1994

equivalent are gross official reserves; seasonal smoothing
of divergent foreign exchange demand and supply flows
Commitment to Poverty Alleviation
2.9     The new  GOM  had run on a poverty-focused platform, and since taking
office has followed through in both word and deed. Within weeks of the 1994
elections, the new GOM acted on a campaign promise and announced the
removal of all primary school fees. This resulted in a dramatic, and largely
unexpected, increase in the number of primary students from 1.9 million to over
3 million, with more equitable enrollment across gender, regions, and household

income levels. Girls gross enrollment increased from 75% to 96%, gross
enrollment of the poorest quintile increased from 58% to 74%. The GOM's
seriousness about putting poverty alleviation at the center of its development
agenda was translated  into  a Poverty  Alleviation  Program.   A  Poverty
Monitoring Unit was set up to track Malawi's social indicators and coordinate
periodic household surveys. The GOM has embarked on a comprehensive
revision of the budgeting process (Medium-Term Expenditure Framework,
MTEF) and intends to direct more expenditures into pro-poor areas.
Box 2.1: Malawi - Lessons Learned from Previous Adjustment Operations
The following six lessons--drawn from Performance Audit Reports prepared by OED--point to
the reasons why Malawi still ranks among the poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa despite
significant efforts and large resource flows under previous programs:
*  The most important obstacle to sustainable growth and reforms has been the lack of clear
and unequivocal political commitment to poverty alleviation, liberalization in the
smallholder sector, and broad-based private sector development.
*  Delays in acting on agreed measures underscore the weak administrative and
institutional base which constrained many policy reforns.
*  Recurrent and serious external shocks--including terms-of-trade shocks, high interest
rates, oil crises, and closure of Malawi's shortest external transport links through war-tom
Mozambique--repeatedly diverted policymakers' attention from medium-term and long-
term issues.
*  The domineering leadership style of the former Head of State combined with pragmatic
economic policies had some success--particularly in areas where vested interests of the
political elite were not compromised--but failed to achieve broad-based transformation of
the economy.
*  Tangible results with regard to poverty alleviation which have only started to emerge over
the past two years, attest to an unfinished agenda within the broader scheme of
macroeconomic stabilization and broad-based private sector development.
*  Greater rigor in economic and sector analyses might have pointed to actions that could
have enhanced the impact of adjustment operations, particularly in poverty alleviation.
Commitment to Broad-Based Private Sector Development
2.10   Through the preparation of a Privatization Policy Framework, the GOM
has launched a privatization program to help attract foreign and domestic
investment and facilitate broad-based private sector development. In addition,
new agricultural strategy comnmits Malawi to far-reaching deregulation and the
promotion of smallholder development. In early 1995 marketing restrictions on
smallholder tobacco growers were lifted, and smallholder tobacco quotas were
de facto removed to benefit the poor. Fixed producer and consumer prices for
maize were replaced by a market-oriented price band;  this should improve



8                                                           Chapter 2
efficiency in production and marketing of maize and other food crops and help
promote crop diversification and food security.
Government-driven Preparation Process and Broad Consultation
2.11  In addition to initiating the policies that are supported by the proposed
operation. the GOM has moved effectively in preparing critical program
components. such as the civil service census, the privatization framework, and
the MTEF (ref. attached GOM's Letter of Development Policy - LDP). The
GOM is building political commitment to the reforms, for instance, through
Cabinet-level discussions of both the PFP and the pre-appraisal mission's Aide
Memoire. Furthermore, the GOM has vowed to involve civil society in the
planning and implementation of development programs.  Meetings between
policymakers, private sector representatives and the churches have helped to
increase and widen understanding of and appreciation for the tight fiscal and
macroeconomic measures which are often perceived as anti-poor.  Two
Economic Development Institute (EDI) missions visited Malawi since
November 1995 to assist the GOM in working out a systematic communications
strategy, held meetings with a cross section of civil society, and provided
training to Information Officers and the press.
3. WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE
STRATEGY
LINKS BETWEEN THE PROPOSED PROGRAM AND THE CAS
3.1   The World Bank Group's work in Malawi--policy dialogue, economic
and sector work, and lending--is all intended to bring about sustainable poverty
reduction (details are presented in the CAS) by supporting macroeconomic
stabilization, investing in physical infrastructure and human capital formnation.
assisting broad-based private sector development, and implementing targeted
programs to protect the poorest segments of the population from undue hardship.
3.2   The FRDP represents the logical continuation of IDA involvement in
Malawi's adjustment to a difficult external environment. It removes a large
backlog of policy distortions and supports several planks of a comprehensive
and medium to long-term reform program that is anchored in the 6th PFP. Many
policy measures from this agenda have been implemented (including education
sector policy, agricultural pricing, fiscal stabilization). In other areas credible



Bank Group Assistance Strategy                                    9
processes have been launched and specific performance benchmarks have been
agreed (including expenditure reform, civil service reform, and privatization).
Lastly, there is a range of policy issues where GOM has expressed its
commitment to reform, but where further analytical work needs to be carried out
before specific measures are identified. In those areas we are actively engaged
in providing guidance and advice to the GOM and expect to narrow down the
scope and timing of specific measures within the next 12 to 18 months
(including land policy reform and drought-proofing).
3.3   The proposed program draws on the successful components of previous
adjustment programs and is linked to several ongoing IDA projects. First,
policies initiated under the two previous adjustment operations (such as tariff
reform and agricultural liberalization) will be accelerated and completed under
the proposed program. Second, policies supported under the proposed operation
complement the technical assistance provided under the Second Institutional
Development Project;  in particular civil service reform, privatization, and
budget management. Third, the proposed program aims at increasing recurrent
expenditures to the social sectors and, above all, enhancing their effectiveness.
This will be critical for sustaining ongoing and forthcoming IDA projects; for
instance, the Integrated Education Sector Project, the community-based Malawi
Social Action Fund (MASAF), and the Population, Health and Nutrition Credit.
Finally, a wide range of activities (including tax and tariff reform) is being
promoted in Malawi under the Cross Border Initiative for Eastern and Southern
Africa (CBI); the proposed Credit will support these measures.
STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT DURING PREPARATION OF THE PROGRAM
3.4   The FRDP has been prepared with an explicit consensus regarding the
need to broaden the understanding of (and commitment to) reform within and
outside government. This continues the close collaboration established at the
operational level during preparation of the program and launching of the CAS
with stakeholder meetings in the field. Important areas for policy actions
identified by various stakeholder groups overlap with the measures to be
supported by the adjustment operation (for example, agricultural marketing and
restrictions on private sector entry). The findings of the 1993 manufacturing
sector survey were discussed in a joint workshop with GOM and the private
sector. The ensuing policy recommendations for increasing access to industrial
land and streamlining the investment process will be supported by the proposed
operation. Joint GOM/Bank meetings with the private sector and NGOs were
held during appraisal to solicit feedback on the envisaged policy measures;
there was broad support and understanding of the FRDP policies. The proposed
operation takes into account the findings from the 1995 Borrower Feedback
Survey and focuses directly on poverty alleviation; for instance, policies that
will give smallholders access to the full range of economic activities, and the
targeting of expenditure allocations in primary social services. The Credit will



10                                                         Chapter 3
provide funds to carry out stakeholder meetings to gauge the impact of policy
measures on vulnerable groups and support the GOM's communications
strategy.
INTERNAL CONSULTATION PROCESS IN THE WORLD BANK
3.5   The proposed operation is based on extensive empirical and analytical
work carried out by IDA with the GOM. Staff from the Southern Africa
Department, the Technical Department, the Agricultural Research Department,
and the Private Sector Development Department were full team members
throughout the preparation of the operation. The 1994 Agricultural Sector
Memorandum (and GOM's Agricultural Strategy Paper) identified strategy
options to help trigger broad-based agricultural growth. Background papers on
the transport sector and a manufacturing sector survey (both in 1993) provide
insights into policy and institutional constraints to private sector development.
Quantitative analyses--carried out jointly by IDA and the GOM over the past
9 months--provide the basis for recommendations on tax and tariff policy
reforrns. The 1995 Budget Management Review (BMR) provides a basis for
expenditure control measures and modifications of the budget-making process.
Civil service pay issues are discussed in the 1994 Pay and Employment Study.
The 1995 Malawi Poverty Profile identifies the dimensions and main variables
of poverty in Malawi and lays the groundwork for promoting reforms in land
policy and deregulation of agricultural markets and domestic transport. The
operation will be complemented by ongoing work on strategies to mitigate the
impact of drought-related shocks. Key processing steps and a list of supporting
documents for the operation are presented in Annex  C:  Supplementary
Information.
COLLABORATION WITH IMF
3.6   The programs of the Bank and IMF in Malawi are coordinated closely
and there are no outstanding differences of opinion. Balance of payment needs
are jointly agreed among the Bank, the IMF, and the GOM as part of the PFP
and the Consultative Group processes. Bank proposals on trade and taxation
policy, privatization, civil service reforms, investment incentives, expenditure
targets are kept consistent with the fiscal targets under IMF supported programs,
and the IMF's structural policy benchmarks are developed in close consultation
with the Bank. Joint Bank/IMF missions prepared the 6th PFP in July 1995 and
reviewed macroeconomic developments in early March 1996 when the IMF
reached understanding with the authorities on a program for 1996/97.

4. MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
RECENT TURN-AROUND IN MACROECONOMIC SITUATION
4.1   Over the past 12 months, the GOM has made good progress in achieving
macroeconomic stabilization; it assumed power in May 1994 when the economy
was rapidly deteriorating. In 1991-94 Malawi suffered from a series of external
shocks (equivalent to a 25% loss in GDP) including three droughts, a substantial
decline in the terms-of-trade and suspension of bilateral non-humanitarian aid
for 18 months before the elections. Immediately after taking office, the new
GOM's macroeconomic management was challenged by (a) a series of civil
service strikes; (b) the deterioration of fiscal management during the months
leading up to the elections; and (c) the financing requirements to hire more than
20,000 additional teachers and provide textbooks to accommodate the
"overnight" increase in enrollment after removal of primary school fees. The
new GOM acted quickly and--despite initial difficulties in effectively controlling
expenditures--is gradually achieving fiscal stabilization.  Since April 1995
public expenditures are controlled under a cash budgeting system. The GOM
has let market forces determine the exchange rate and has resisted popular
pressures to reverse the floatation of the kwacha (February 1994)--even when
the kwacha depreciated by 100 % in October 1994. The exchange rate has been
stable in the last 15 months.  The Reserve Bank has been successful in
smoothing seasonal fluctuations in foreign exchange demand and supply and,
aided by tobacco earnings, accumulated official reserves equivalent to 2 months
of imports by end-1995. Quarterly inflation rates decreased from 34% to 7%
between January and August 1995; since then rates have picked up (to
around 20%) because of sharp price increases in food stuffs as a result of the
1994/95 shortfall in maize production. These improvements in economic
performance led to agreement on (i) a three-year program under the IMF's
Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF, presented to the IMF's Board
on October 18, 1995); (ii) the 6th PFP (issued on October 10, 1995); and
(iii) recent agreement with Bank and IMF missions on a program for 1996/97.
The proposed operation would complement the IMF-supported stabilization
program by adding the medium and long-term elements needed for sustained
stability and growth.

OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
4.2    The  macroeconomic  situation  remains  precarious, and  economic
management in the near term will focus on stabilization to further reduce fiscal
imbalances and lower the inflation rate. The medium-term strategy places
greater emphasis on policies and structural measures to promote domestic
savings and investment and improve external competitiveness. Agriculture will
continue to be a major source of growth--providing employment and subsistence
for some 80 % of the population. Growth in the manufacturing sector is
expected to be supported by a liberalized exchange system, the rationalization of
external tariffs, and the reduction in external transport costs as direct routes to
Mozambican ports will become fully operational.
4.3    Against this background, the overall medium-term  macroeconomic
objectives (Table 4.1: Malawi - Selected Macroeconomic Indicators) are:
(a) recovery in real GDP in 1995 and medium-term real growth of 1.5% per
capita; (b) a sharp, early deceleration in the rate of inflation, with a decline to an
average annual rate of less than 10%; (c) a gradual decline in external
imbalances over the medium term; and (d) the accommodation of pressing social
needs within the constraint of fiscal sustainability by prioritizing government
expenditures in the context of a MTEF.

4.4    The attainment of the growth objectives requires an increase in the rate
of investment, particularly of private investment, as well as a substantial
improvement in investment quality. The revised medium-term projections
indicate that the investment/GDP ratio would rise from 13% in 1994 to about
17% in 1998. Over the medium term, domestic savings are expected to finance
an increasing share of total investment as a result of the improvement in the
public financial position and higher private savings. Most of the projected
increase in domestic savings will come from fiscal savings (in the order of
5% GDP), leaving a 3%  increase to be created by private savings.  The



Macroeconomic Framework                                           13
assumption is that Malawi will recover from three droughts in the past four
years, and income levels--and hence savings ratios--will be slightly above pre-
drought levels (of around 12%). Additional savings will be realized from
(a) reduction in external transport costs after the shortest routes to the sea
through Mozambique become fully operational; (b) higher rural incomes in line
with liberalization in the smallholder sector; and (c) improved investment
climate.
4.5   The fiscal policy strategy will emphasize discipline and the consolidation
and extension of structural policy reforms. On this basis, after rising from
8.4% of GDP in 1993 to 25.8% of GDP in 1994, the overall deficit (before
grants) is targeted to decline to 9.9% by 1996 (about 4% after grants). Current
expenditure is targetted to decline from 29% of GDP in 1994 to 18% of GDP in
1996; mainly through reduced interest payments and a smaller wage bill, but
also through eliminating the costs related to the political transition in 1994
(equivalent to 2% of GDP) and drought (6% of GDP in 1994). This will restore
recurrent expenditure levels for goods and services to historical levels (10% of
GDP) and implies an increase in real terms of 5% against 1995. Prioritization of
current expenditure will ensure adequate provision for basic education and
health services, extension services in agriculture, and operation and maintenance
of the road system. Development spending is projected to remain at between
6% to 7% of GDP. Reduction in the fiscal deficit will also be supported through
revenue enhancing measures, improved administrative capacity of Customs and
broadening the tax base, to sustain a revenue/GDP ratio of 18%.
4.6   The medium-term projections indicate that the prospects for Malawi's
major exports will improve moderately because of the protracted stagnation of
world market prices for tobacco, and the generally weak demand outlook for
sugar, tea, and other agricultural exports. Nevertheless, exports are expected to
be boosted by continued trade liberalization, including the removal of export
licensing. Given this, the volume of exports is projected to increase at an
average annual rate of 7.6% over 1995-98, reflecting increases in the volume of
nontraditional agricultural exports and manufactured goods in response to the
accelerated removal of the remaining barriers to competition in production and
marketing. Import volume is projected to grow broadly in line with the increase
in real GDP, with the impact of further import liberalization and tariff reform
being roughly offset by tightened demand management and depreciation of the
kwacha. The external current account deficit (excluding grants) is expected to
decline from 18% of GDP in 1994 to 7.7% in 1998. Malawi's debt service ratio
is projected to decline modestly from 23% in 1995 to an average of about
20% of exports of goods and non-factor services over the medium term,
reflecting the continuation of current policies, which largely limit external
borrowing to concessional long-term loans. With the assumed levels of external
assistance, gross official reserves would increase from the equivalent of
0.8 months of imports at the end of 1994 to 5 months equivalent by end-1998.

EXTERNAL FINANCING REQUIREMENTS
4.7   Malawi's continued progress in structural reforrns significantly enhances
long-run growth prospects. However continued donor support in the form of
external concessional resources is needed in the short and medium term to
support the adjustment agenda. For 1996 expected aid flows are sufficient to
close Malawi's external financing gap (Table 4.2: Malawi - Extemal Financing
Requirements);   comprising  of US$131  million  in  project support,
US$128 million in balance of payment support (including US$74.4 million
under the initial tranche of the proposed operation, anticipated support under the
FRDP from the Governments of Japan, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden and
US$24 million expected under the IMF's ESAF), and US$9 million for drought-
related support. For 1997-98, external financing requirements to be met by aid
flows are estimated at US$539 million of which approximately US$480 million
has tentatively been identified. A financing gap of US$60 million remains for
1997-98 which could be filled in part from resources under a follow-on IDA
operation.  On average over the next three years, IDA's contribution of
approximately one-third of total import support would be in line with average
IDA contributions over the past years.

The Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation Program                15
5. THE FISCAL RESTRUCTURING AND
DEREGULATION PROGRAM
OBJECTIVES
5.1   Two constraints have consistently been identified in stakeholder
meetings, our dialogue with the GOM, and our analytical work, as most binding
to poverty alleviation and to achieving Malawi's economic objectives of
significant medium-ternn real growth per capita, single-digit inflation, and a
viable external balance:
*  Anti-poor bias and low quality of social sector expenditures
The Poverty Profile shows that public expenditures on social
services such as education and health have been consistently
higher in Malawi (US$58 per capita in 1993) than in countries
with similarly low GDP per capita (US$41 per capita). These
aggregate numbers, however, are misleading because they
conceal a highly unequal subsectoral composition of social
spending.  Proportional allocations to primary level services,
which is the level most likely to be needed by the poor, are
among the lowest in Malawi. In 1990/91 the poorest income
quintile received only 10% of all public education spending,
while the share going to the richest income quintile was 38%.
Although the removal of all primary school fees in 1994/95 has
substantially reduced this inequality (to 16% and 25%,
respectively), additional restructuring is needed to reach a larger
share of the population.
*  Restrictions and regulations that prevent the poor from
participating in the full range of economic activities
Both the Agricultural Sector Memorandum and the Poverty
Profile concluded that deregulation of smallholder marketing,
pricing, and production (especially profitable cash crops like
burley tobacco) will be critical for unleashing the economic
potential of rural areas. Through forward and backward linkages,
incremental smallholder income has an income multiplier effect
of approximately 1.5 which makes the agricultural sector--
specifically smallholder production--a potential engine of broad-
based growth.

5.2   To assist Malawi to attain its economic objectives and succeed in
alleviating the country's pervasive poverty problem, the proposed operation
focuses on two broad policy areas:
*  Fiscal restructuring  aims to prioritize, protect, and, where
necessary, expand inter-sectoral and intra-sectoral allocations to the
social sectors on a sustainable basis while staying within the overall
fiscal framework now being monitored under the IMF's ESAF
program.  The operation supports development of a MTEF,
comprehensive civil service reform, and tax and tariff reform.
*  Deregulation  will accelerate the consolidation  of structural
measures already initiated by the GOM under previous adjustment
operations. This includes complete removal of remaining pricing
and marketing constraints on smallholder agriculture, and removal
of the binding constraints to broad-based private sector entry and
development.
5.3   In both areas, Government has implemented significant policy measures
and has launched several initiatives that put the program  on track toward
yielding results on the ground. In fact, before Board presentation, (Government
implemented 41 out of 42 actions and policy measures that are supported under
the FRDP and were identified in the Initiating Memorandum. As envisaged in
the Initiating Memorandum the remaining civil service reform measures will
trigger release of the Second Tranche.
ACTIONS SUPPORTED BY THE OPERATION
Fiscal Restructuring
5.4   Fiscal restructuring has four dimensions:
(a)   The main challenge is to reorient public spending to pro-poor
areas in line with the GOM's commitment to expand the
provision of social services to the majority of the population.
(b)   To this challenge must be added the task of restoring fiscal
discipline and reversing the collapse in expenditure control and
lack of accountability in the wake of unbudgeted expenditures
during the political transition and the precipitous and
unanticipated depreciation of the kwacha (250 %) in the
10 months following floatation in February 1994.



The Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation Program               17
(c)   Civil service reform will be crucial for reversing the increasing
imbalance between wage and non-wage recurrent expenditures.
(d)   Tax and tariff reforms are essential for improving fiscal
revenue performance.
Expenditure Reorientation
5.5   The BMR shows that Malawi typifies the pattern of development
financing based on numerous and fragmented donor-funded projects, slow
implementation because of insufficient counterpart funding, and chronic tension
between the recurrent and development budgets with recurrent expenditures
inadequate to sustain investment projects beyond the donor-supported
implementation phase.  The required expenditure restructuring cannot be
accomplished within the traditional public expenditure planning process; the
project-driven planning and budgeting process needs to be changed to link the
recurrent and development budgets.
5.6   Under the FRDP, a MTEF is being developed to help ministries
prioritize inter-sectoral and intra-sectoral expenditures within the agreed overall
macroeconomic expenditure envelope.  Instead of setting a priori global
expenditure shares for education or health--which are ineffective indicators
because of a high wage component in sectoral budgets--the proposed program
will support a bottom-up process whereby sectoral program priorities (such as
allocations for district level health services, goods and services for primary
schools, medical supplies for rural health clinics) be reconciled with varying
funding levels in a MTEF. The program will help to ensure that both the
targeted fiscal deficit reduction and the concurrent expansion of social services
are achieved rationally without compromising the GOM's pro-poor policy focus.
Since the MTEF was launched in May, during Preappraisal, we have been
monitoring progress closely and are providing technical assistance to
supplement GOM's capacity in this area under the Second Institutional
Development Project. At this time, the MTEF pilot includes four sectoral
working groups: Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education, Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock Development, and Ministry of Works and Supplies.
The MTEF progressed well in preparation for the FY96/97 budget. Political
commitment at the Cabinet level for a more rationale expenditure allocation was
secured, and the benchmarks for the FY96/97 budget were agreed with IDA
during Appraisal in December 1995 (Table 5.1).

5.7   The FY96/97 budget conforms to the macroeconomic targets agreed to
under the ESAF for total expenditures and domestic borrowing. To provide
adequate funds for priority areas and essential items, the Government reviewed
expenditures in non-priority sectors and cut/reduced these expenditure categories
(such as fuel and lubricants, travel, and replacement of motor vehicles). Detailed
sectoral expenditure plans for the four MTEF pilot ministries were completed in
February 1996, agreed with IDA, and are reflected in the FY96/97 budget (Table
5.2: Malawi MTEF - Sectoral Expenditure Shares). In nominal terms, allocation
of recurrent spending to the four primary sectors will increase by 33% while the
increase in recurrent spending to the remaining ministries will be limited to 5%
in nominal terms. Further, the Government reviewed and rationalized the PSIP
in the context of the MTEF to ensure that the selection of investment projects is
consistent with pro-poor development priorities and recurrent expenditure
capacities. For FY96/97 60% of the PSIP has been allocated to social sectors,
this compares favorably with 55% in FY95/96. The bulk of resources has been
allocated to those projects which are rural in nature and have a more positive
impact in alleviating poverty. For instance, new primary road projects were
canceled in favor of village access roads and maintenance of district roads.
5.8   More specifically, with the FY96/97 budget, the GOM  is aiming to
protect the recent increase in the Ministry of Education's share (22% in
FY95/96) in total recurrent expenditures and even increased it to the medium-
term target level of 25%. The share of primary education within recurrent
expenditures of the Ministry of Education was increased from 47% in FY95/96
to about 66% in FY96/97. Similarly, the expenditure share on primary health
care was increased from 8% in FY94/95 to about 14% in FY96/97 of recurrent
health care spending. The GOM aims to reach an allocation for medical supplies
and medicines equivalent to US$1.25 per capita by FY97/98. Within total
recurrent expenditures for health care services 7% has been allocated to Family
Planning Services in FY96/97. The share of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock Development in total recurrent expenditures has been maintained at
around 5% of total recurrent expenditures with about 40% of this being allocated
to extension services to ensure that an increasing share of smallholder farmers is
being reached. Within the recurrent expenditures allocation to the Ministry of
Works (about 5% of total recurrent expenditures) emphasis is given to road
maintenance and rural roads (50% of the Ministry's recurrent budget).

5.9      The MTEF will be rolled out over the next six months to all ministries in
preparation for the FY97/98 budget. In this context, lessons learned from the
pilot phase of the MTEF will be applied (Box 5. 1):
(a)      First, the Audit and Finance Committee of Permanent Secretaries
will provide guidance to the MTEF Task Force. Tentative
sectoral expenditure envelopes for the next three years will be
discussed by the Cabinet Committee on the Economy in
June 1996.
(b)    Second, increased focus will be put on the medium-term aspects
whereby tentative expenditure needs and shares will be developed
for a three-year rolling period. In this regard, by October 1996,
ministries will carry out a line-by-line review of functions and
identify those programs that will be phased out, functions that
will be outsourced to the private sector, and those priority
functions for which funding levels would be increased.
(c)      Third, line  ministries  will take  into  account changes  in  civil
service staffing levels that will allow a reallocation of (i) civil

servants from low priority areas to high priority areas and
(ii) resources from the wages and salaries category to goods and
services.
(d)      Fourth, the  links  between  the  PSIP  and  the  MTEF  will be
strengthened to ensure that the selection of investment projects is
consistent with pro-poor development priorities and recurrent
expenditure capacities.
(e)      Fifth, the  GOM   intends to  integrate  the  recurrent and  capital
budgets. For the FY97/98 budget, this integration is envisaged to
be completed for the four MTEF pilot ministries.
(f)      Sixth, the program  costing exercise will be improved , inter alia,
through preparation of a MTEF manual.
Box 5.1: Malawi - Quotes from Sectoral MTEF Reports
"one of the main achievements of the process was the wide participation of officials in the costing of
programs and activities."
"Each of the sectors had developed well-articulated sector policies and strategies, and used these to
develop sectoral programs."
"... the costing exercise was one of the weaker elements in the process.... Improving the programme
costing exercise will be the main focus of refining the MTEF methodology to line ministries in 1996."
"The four pilot ministries have concentrated their efforts on the 1996/97 estimates and made little progress
in refining the details of forward estimates for 1997/98 and 1998/89."
"...most ministries have high proportions of the budget allocated to personal emoluments which leaves
little room for reductions in other recurrent expenditures. ...significant reductions in personal emoluments
will only come about through medium-term restructuring of ministries' functions and establishments."
"Two of the key activities for the second round of the MTEF preparation will be a review of the functions
and activities of ministries, so as to determine those activities to be contracted out or stopped altogether."
"The MTEF exercise has enabled the Ministry to identify and cost in detail its activities and this
information will be used to determine which specific activities need to be given higher priority than those
that will be scaled back."
'The required expenditure cuts imply that certain activities will have to be foregone by the Ministry and
the implications of these cuts were identified and described
"Secondary school utilization is inefficient as many schools are not used in the afternoons."
Expenditure StabUization
5.10    The essential short-term  measure to effectively control expenditures--a
cash budget system--has been put in place. It is being supported by additional
medium-term measures, including: (a) a monitoring system to ensure that cash



The Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation Program                   21
books are kept up-to-date and reconciled with bank statements; (b) development
of a Financial Management Information System (FMIS) to permit continuous
monitoring of commitments; and (c) periodic reconciliation of GOM's accounts
with parastatals (electricity, water, telecommunications) to prevent accumulation
of arrears. These measures are working satisfactorily and will help ensure a
reduction in the fiscal deficit. Until comprehensive expenditure prioritization is
achieved through the expansion of the MTEF, the cash budget system will
remain in place.
Civil Service Reform
5.11  Civil service reform is critical for containing the overall wage bill to
achieve fiscal stabilization and restructure expenditures to increase the efficiency
of public service delivery.  Over the past eight months, several short-term
measures to contain the civil service wage bill and reverse the explosion in the
size of the civil service have been taken. Funded vacancies that had remained
unfilled for more than five years were frozen.  In August 1995 the GOM
removed a number of vacancies for which line ministries had drawn funding
("ghost workers") from the establishment. Between February and September
1995, under the FRDP, the GOM retrenched approximately 20,000 civil servants
in non-established and temporary positions in non-priority areas (for instance,
unskilled laborers, cooks, gardeners, bricklayers, plumbers, drivers, messengers
and janitors).
5.12   With a medium-term perspective, the GOM  has embarked on a civil
service reform process to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of public
service delivery. A Civil Service Census was carried out during October 1995 to
help generate reliable benchmark data for an effective personnel management
and control system. Technical assistance for the Civil Service Census exercise
was provided under the ongoing Second Institutional Development Project. The
FRDP would support the policy measures under civil service reform and provide
budgetary support--through the Second   Tranche (Civil Service Reform
Tranche)--on a "just-in-time basis" to reduce the fiscal implications of
separation packages and civil service retrenchment plans that might otherwise
squeeze recurrent expenditures in priority social sectors.
5.13  To this end the GOM has also embarked on analytical work that will
broaden and deepen the scope of civil service reform; including a systematic
review of government functions and a review of civil service pay and
remuneration. The latter study has been completed and is currently being
discussed by Government. The functional review is at an interim stage and is
expected to be finalized by end April 1996. It is apparent that some ministries
and departments are overstaffed, with considerable duplication of functions,
while critical personnel categories such as health--i.e. doctors--remain
understaffed. An Interministerial Commission has been appointed to oversee the



22                                                             Chapter 5
implementation of the results of the Civil Service Census and prepare an action
plan for the next steps in civil service reform.
5.14 Completion of the Civil Service Reform Action plan--acceptable to the
Bank--is expected by September 30, 1996 and will draw on the findings and
conclusions of the civil service census, the functional review, the remuneration
study and the ongoing MTEF exercise. Civil service reform will go beyond
downsizing of the civil service; it is expected that part of the savings resulting
from reducing the size of the civil service would be plowed back to raise civil
service remuneration levels and reduce wage compression. It is the GOM's
objective to achieve a civil service size and remuneration structure that is
consistent with a sustainable civil service wage bill of not more than 6.5% of
GDP. The Action Plan will include, inter alia, timing and scope of:
(a)    A  retrenchment program  including transparent retrenchment
criteria, appropriate safety net measures, and quantitative targets
for the size of the civil service as well as cost and financing
estimates thereof.
(b)   The restructuring  of civil service salaries with  improved
incentives and levels of remuneration for a smaller civil service
within a sustainable overall wage bill.
(c)    The arrangements for implementing decentralization, including
intergovernmental fiscal relations.
(d)   The completion of job evaluation exercise with a view  to
improving the present recruitment, posting, and promotion
practices.
(e)   The realignment of civil service staffing levels in line with
government's pro-poor focus and a reduction in both low priority
government programs and functions, including (i) focus on
training of qualified teachers to achieve a student: teacher ratio of
60:1 for primary education and (ii) adequate staffing of all health
clinics with at least one general nurse and one maternity nurse.
5.15  In addition, implementation of the following measures from  the
aforementioned Action Plan would trigger release of the Second Tranche:
(a)   The GOM will have stopped paying salaries or wages to civil
servants who are not listed on the civil service census file.
(b)   The GOM  will start to eliminate or merge duplicating and
overlapping government functions that are currently being carried
out by different agencies.



The Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation Program                 23
(c)   Within the context of the functional review, the GOM will have
started to outsource, privatize, or eliminate functions such as
security guard services, management of rest houses and inns,
office cleaning services, etc.
(d)   The number of industrial workers will be reduced and the
category absorbed into the civil service.
(e)   To improve the efficiency and effectiveness of common services
cadres, Government will have started to put in place provisions
for adequate authority of line managers in deploying, retaining,
and evaluating performance of common services staff.
Tax and Tariff Policies
5.16  Malawi has established a good record in tax and tariff reform. In many
ways, Malawi's tariff system is more efficient than in neighboring countries:
(a) the surtax rates (effectively a value-added tax collected at the production
stage) on domestic production and imports were harmonized in 1993; and
(b) ad valorem excise taxes on luxury goods (imports and domestic goods) were
introduced in 1994. The current tariff structure comprises seven rates ranging
from 0% to 45%. In FY95/96, the GOM introduced a temporary 10% export tax
on tobacco, tea, and sugar and special drought levies (3%) on personal and
corporate taxes to redress revenue shortages. These taxes will be phased out as
revenue collection is strengthened; with the FY96/97 budget, the GOM reduced
the export tax to 8%.
5.17   Tariff Reform: However additional tax policy reforms are needed to
encourage the growth and diversification of non-traditional exports which have
been virtually stagnant during the last five years. Under the FRDP, priority is
given to reducing anti-export bias, increasing external competitiveness, and
gradually shifting the revenue function from tariffs to surtax. To attain these
vital objectives, Malawi is undertaking tariff reduction in line with the
agreements under the CBI and the Uruguay Round with the ultimate goal of
achieving a 4-tier tariff structure with maximum and average rates of 25% and
15%, respectively, by FY98/99. We have agreed with the GOM on a phased
plan to achieve these targets; with the FY96/97 budget, the maximum tariffs
were reduced from 45% to 40% and average statutory rates were lowered from
18% to about 15%. Further, average statutory tariff rates for capital goods and
intermediate goods were reduced from 17% to 12%. This will provide effective
border tax relief for Malawian exporters and producers who were competing
against consumer goods imported from neighboring countries at preferential
tariff rates agreed under bilateral treaties and the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA).



24                                                           Chapter S
5.18  Surtax Reform.  Lowering tariff rates could have adverse revenue
consequences for Malawi in the middle of fiscal stabilization efforts. To protect
revenues, tariff reductions are accompanied by surtax reform; making the surtax
rate uniforn across goods and increasing surtax rates on items which are taxed
below the standard rate of 20%. With the FY96/97 budget, the GOM simplified
the surtax structure on goods and services to a four tier system: 20%, 10%, 0%,
and exempt. This involves increases in the surtax rate from 10% to 20% for
(i) hotel and restaurant services, and (ii) a number of intermediate and final
goods (thus bringing imports and domestic production to an equal footing). The
zero and exempt surtax rates for the agricultural, food processing, and
pharmaceutical sectors where maintained in the interest of equity and poverty
alleviation. Finally, during FY96/97, the GOM will review discretionary
exemptions and phase-out those that are not based on or linked to diplomatic
status or treaties with international organizations.
5.19  Administrative Strengthening. Good progress has been made over the
past six months in strengthening customs administration and tax collection; at
end FY95/96, cumulative tax revenues were running about 9% above agreed
targets. With regard to strengthening tax and customs administration, the GOM
has expanded the Pre-Shipment Inspection System (PSI) to cover all import
shipments in excess of US$3,000 in conjunction with improvements in customs
clearance and valuation. The GOM is receiving substantial technical assistance
in support of these policy measures from the IMF and the British Government.
5.20  Additional steps to boost tax and tariff collection efficiency are desirable.
The GOM intends to establish a performance-related remuneration system for
revenue agencies in FY97/98 and is currently evaluating the feasibility and cost
effectiveness of establishing an autonomous revenue authority outside the civil
service by FY98/99. Over the medium term, the GOM plans to expand the
surtax credit mechanism for inputs to the retail level with a view to converting
the present system to a full-fledged VAT.
5.21  Export Promotion: Concurrently with the preceding reforms, additional
specific tax incentives are needed to promote non-traditional exports and reduce
the inherent anti-export bias of border taxes. Bonded manufacturing provisions
have existed in Malawi for several years, but have mainly been utilized by the
ready-made garment industry. In practice, the procedures for obtaining in-bond
manufacturing status have been cumbersome and have excluded important
industries, for example horticulture and agroprocesssing, both areas where
Malawi has shown good growth potential and significant investor interest over
the past three years. To address these shortcomings, in December 1995, the
GOM implemented new legislation for Export Processing Zones (EPZ). The
Act is comprehensive in its coverage of all sectors and portable, in that specific
factory sites and horticulture farms can be established as EPZs. Furthermore, to
simplify and streamline export duty drawback regulations, in February 1996, the



The Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation Program                 25
Ministry of Finance has expanded the initial refund to bona fide exporters from
75% to 100% of duty paid, and a revolving fund has been set up with the
Customs and Excise Department to effect refund payments within 5 working
days. Over the medium term, Malawi plans to replace the administratively
intensive case-by-case drawback program with simple rate coefficients or
average duty drawback rates for a limited number of commonly-exported
products.
Deregulation of Agricultural Policies
5.22  Agriculture accounts for 40% of GDP and 90% of the export earnings of
Malawi, and will remain the mainstay of growth for the foreseeable future.
Given that 85% of the population lives in the rural areas, the performance of this
sector directly affects the welfare of most Malawians, including the most
vulnerable. In December 1994 the GOM adopted a comprehensive sectoral
strategy to help transform the agricultural sector from a subsistence/dualistic
structure (over-dependent on maize and tobacco) to a more diversified and
viable one that also functions as a catalyst for growth in the non-farm sector.
The main objective of the GOM's strategy is to attain broad-based sustainable
agricultural growth of at least 3% p.a. (which is the four-year average of three
normal years with 4.5% growth each followed by a moderate drought year with -
1% agricultural growth). This can be achieved by removing the most binding
constraints (access to land, cash crops, inputs, and markets) to the integration of
smallholders into the mainstream of development.
Access to Land
5.23  Since Independence, agricultural land-use policy has remained strongly
divided between freehold or leasehold and customary tenure, that is, between
mostly export crop production by estates and mostly subsistence farming by
smallholders. Privileges to grow burley tobacco (allocated exclusively to
estates through a license and quota system) fueled large-scale reclassification
of land from customary tenure (smallholder land) to leasehold; the number of
leasehold estates soared from 1,200 in 1979, to 30,000 in 1994, and average
size dropped from 250 ha to less than 20 ha. Much of the tenure conversion
has taken place in an uncoordinated way and many plots are claimed by more
than one leaseholder. In addition, there is a large backlog of unregistered
lease applications.
5.24  Recent economic and political liberalization has resulted in increased
assertiveness among the land-poor, who challenge the integrity of leasehold
titles and call for a comprehensive reform of land policies. The increasing
incidence of encroachments by smallholders on estates and public lands is
evidence of mounting problems of land availability (about 40% of all



26                                                            Chapter 5
smallholder households cultivate less than 0.5 ha) which is compounded by
weak capacity in land administration.  With high population growth and
conflicting interests between estates and smallholders, more serious upheavals
can be expected, with high social, political, economic, and environmental costs.
Thus, there is an urgent need for a thorough examination of land titles and lease
registration and for the formulation of new policies.  This task requires
widespread national consultation and consensus building to find acceptable
solutions in a democratic environment. Forced land redistribution is neither
politically viable nor economically desirable.
5.25  In line with the overall political liberalization, the new GOM is open to
discussions and actions on land policy issues which were virtually taboo in the
past. However, in view of the GOM's limited administrative capacities in this
area the dialogue is at an early stage. We expect detailed measures of a new
land policy to be agreed upon by 1997 after substantial analytical work is
completed. In preparation of the proposed program the GOM has undertaken
actions that demonstrate its commitment to land policy reform at the highest
political levels. In March 1996 the GOM appointed a Presidential Commission
of Inquiry to undertake a broad review of land problems throughout the country
and to recommend the main principles of a new land policy which would foster a
more efficient, environmentally sustainable and socially equitable land tenure
system. The Presidential Commission (representing a wide cross-section of
Malawi society and economic interests, such as smallholders, traditional
authorities, estate owners, tenants and workers, urban business owners, NGOs,
and representatives of major parties) will adopt transparent and participatory
methods in reviewing land problems and considering their solutions. The
Commission's recommendations--combined with the analytical work that is
being carried out by the newly-created Policy Planning Unit of the Ministry of
Land and Valuation--will define the new land policy principles and institutional
structures aimed at secure land tenure arrangements and sound land lease
procedures, along with market clearing land rents, and an active land market.
5.26 While the Presidential Commission is carrying out its work, the Ministry
of Lands and Valuation has suspended all conversions from customary to
leasehold tenure--country-wide--to allow government agencies to review the
validity of existing leaseholds, resolve pending lease disputes, update land
registries, and prevent environmentally harmful encroachment along the lake
shore. To immediately raise incentives for more efficient use of existing estate
land and facilitate the development of a more active land market, the GOM has
increased land rents, effective April 1996, from MK35 per hectare to MK50 per
hectare. Significant areas (estimated to be as much as 20%) under leasehold are
idle and higher opportunity costs (higher land rents) will create incentives for
estate owners to sublease and subdivide land. In line with this objective, the
GOM plans to increase land rents in real terms--if necessary--and has revised the



The Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation Program               27
Lands Act to allow for annual land rent updates (previously, land rent updates
could take place only every three years).
Access to Cash Crops
5.27  Over the past four years important progress has been made with regard to
granting smallholders gradual access to profitable cash crop production and
marketing (growing burley tobacco and eliminating the monopsony power of
ADMARC). The Agricultural Sector Memorandum illustrates how smallholder
access to burley tobacco production has (a) improved household income levels
for about 66,000 smallholder households which had burley quotas (average of
250kg) in 1994; (b) enabled diversification in other agricultural and non-
agricultural activities through forward and backward linkages (multiplier of
1.5 for smallholder income from burley tobacco); and (c) reduced household
vulnerability to the effects of drought.
5.28  Convinced by the success of the smallholder burley program, the GOM
has announced plans to remove the quota system within a year.
*  For the 1995/96 season the GOM expanded the smallholder burley
tobacco quota system and the intermediate buyers program. About
100,000 smallholders registered to produce about 50 million kg,
which is twice the planned ceiling of 25 million kg. The GOM
continued to accept all applications for intermediate buyers licenses
(introduced in 1994/95)--to purchase about 8 million kg of non-
quota tobacco from smallholders--which has evolved as another
attractive marketing outlet for smallholder burley.
*  For the 1996/97 season the Tobacco Control Commission (TCC)
will take over responsibility for administering and allocating
national burley tobacco quotas and the registration of smallholders.
The GOM has announced that the TCC will allocate sufficient new
or unused national quota to meet all smallholder production
registrations. There will be no planned ceiling on burley quota for
smallholders.  Smallholders belonging to producer clubs will
register their production with TCC to gain direct access to auction
floors. Smallholders not registering with TCC can sell through one
of 750 intermediate buyers.
*  For the 1997/98 season the GOM has announced replacement of the
national production quota system with a production registration
system with TCC. The registration system is for statistical purposes
and will allow TCC to schedule delivery to the auction floors and
will provide all estates and smallholders with equal opportunities to
produce and market tobacco.



28                                                           Chapter 5
5.29  The number of burley-producing smallholder households could increase
to 200,000--300,000 by the year 2000. Over the next two years this action is
expected to inject US$100 million p.a. into the smallholder sector.
Nevertheless, the burley policy will not reach all smallholders--especially those
with less than 0.5 ha land and no cash to purchase inputs--and will need to be
augmented by other pro-poor policies and programs, for instance: (a) public
works under the coming IDA-supported MASAF; or the IFAD-financed
smallholder food security project (implemented by IDA) that is providing a
package of hybrid maize (for 0.2 ha) and minute tobacco quotas (100 kg for
0.1 ha) to resource-poor farmers with land holdings below 0.5 ha.
Access to Inputs
5.30  A key part of the GOM's strategy to enhance agricultural productivity
and diversification is to increase the access of farmers to improved and suitable
technologies and inputs (such as seeds, fertilizers and feeds). Since 1994 private
traders have been allowed to participate in the import and distribution of
smallholder inputs. However cumbersome licensing and compulsory approval
procedures continued to inhibit smallholders' access to fertilizer, agrochemicals
and improved seeds. This kept transaction costs high, discouraged private trader
participation, and limited crop and livestock options for smallholders.  In
contrast, estates have had unrestricted access to inputs.
5.31  In line with the Agricultural Strategy the GOM  has approved
(January 1996) amendments to both the Fertilizer, Farm Feeds, and Remedies
Act and the Seeds Act to streamline the licensing, registration and reporting
procedures for the importing, selling and distribution of fertilizers and seeds.
The amendments, among other things, (a) remove the requirements that
fertilizers be registered and importers and sellers be licensed; and (b) remove
government control over introduction of new seed varieties. Entrepreneurs will
be free to multiply and trade in all seeds, including hybrid maize and tobacco.
In both markets, the GOM will now only set and monitor truthful labeling and
phytosanitary standards. Private sector entry regulations have been harmonized
with general business practices and are covered under the Business Licensing Act
which is functioning well. The approved changes will improve dissemination of
technology and enhance farmers' access to the best seed varieties and fertilizers
at competitive prices while protecting farmers from unscrupulous traders.
Access to Markets
5.32    Important progress was made during the early 1990s with the
liberalization of virtually all agricultural producer prices and export controls,
leaving maize as the only regulated market. Even in the maize market, private
traders are now allowed to participate and ADMARC has moved from sole



The Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation Program               29
buyer and seller to buyer/seller of last resort. In April 1995 the system of fixed
producer and consumer prices (linked to production costs) was replaced by a
price band in which the actual price can fluctuate and ADMARC defends the
announced floor and ceiling prices. However, the current system could prove
unsustainable and in excess of GOM's financial capabilities if ADMARC were
asked to defend floor and ceiling prices set too far from import or export parity
prices.
5.33  The FRDP will support operationalization of the new maize pricing and
marketing policies in a phased manner with the aim of gradually separating
ADMARC's commercial and developmental functions to become more
commercially-oriented and ready for privatization within the next five years.
The proposed policy measures are supported through technical assistance under
the Agricultural Services Project. Terms of Reference for studies on "The
Future of ADMARC" and "Expanding Private Sector Participation in Maize
Marketing" were agreed with IDA and the studies will be commissioned by end-
May 1996. Specific policy measures would be agreed upon over the next
12 months and implementation could be supported under a follow-on operation.
5.34  The GOM's intention to liberalize agricultural marketing, promote
private sector participation, and enhance smallholder access to competitive
prices was reaffirmed with (a) the repeal (January 1996) of the Agricultural and
Livestock Marketing Act which eliminates ADMARC's monopsony to purchase
smallholder cotton and other crops; and (b) the revision of those provisions of
the Special Crops Act that designated several crops as "special" because of a
perceived need to control production and marketing of these crops. The Act was
also used to exclude smallholders from producing and marketing certain high-
value cash crops, including burley and flue-cured tobacco.
Access to Economic Transport
5.35  In addition to Malawi's high costs of external transport, manufacturers
and consumers alike suffer from inefficient and costly domestic road transport.
Under the protective mantle of government regulations and statutory minimum
freight rates, Malawi's domestic road transport industry has grown over the last
seven years from nearly nothing to almost 500 companies varying in size from
one truck to over 200 trucks. However, while the objective of developing a
substantial domestic trucking industry has been achieved, the objective of
developing efficient domestic road transport service has not; many operations
are poorly managed and inefficient. In early 1995 the statutory rates for
domestic freight exceeded average costs-plus-normal profits by 50% to 70%
resulting in an economic transfer from users of road freight to the trucking sector
equivalent to US$10 million p.a. At times, domestic trucking costs in Malawi
were twice those in neighboring countries and transport for hire (for instance, to
haul smallholder produce from farms to markets) was three times as much as



30                                                           Chapter 5
owner-provided transport. High transport costs make cash crop production
unprofitable for many smallholders, exacerbating poverty levels, preventing
higher land and labour productivity, and constraining agricultural diversification.
5.36  The GOM realizes that Malawi's trucking sector is no longer an infant
industry and that it is necessary to increase efficiency and lower costs in the
transport sector.  In line with this objective, in 1995, the GOM  lifted all
restrictions on importing second-hand vehicles and spare parts to make
Malawian truckers competitive with foreign-owned trucking companies who
have long benefited from access to lower-cost second-hand equipment. In
January 1996 the GOM revised the Road Traffic Act including the removal of
the statutory domestic freight rates. Liberalized domestic road transport will
reduce transport costs, and thus, bring a direct benefit to the rural poor and
facilitate higher agricultural productivity and agricultural diversification.
Deregulation of Private Sector Development Policies
5.37  The GOM supports the development of a broad-based private sector. An
intensive investment promotion campaign to attract investors is underway and a
privatization campaign is gaining momentum.
Investment Promotion
5.38  IDA supported a manufacturing sector survey in 1993 which identified--
in addition to high inflation and (at the time) lack of foreign exchange--the
following main constraints to broad-based private sector development: (a) the
access to industrial land is narrowly constrained, both by an unnecessarily
complicated bureaucratic process and by limited public resources for servicing
potential industrial land; (b) the process of planning and implementing new
investment in Malawi could easily take three years, two of which could be spent
gaining or awaiting various government approvals; and (c) the high level of
economic concentration and considerable market power of large conglomerates
and parastatals discourages entry by potentially more efficient small-scale
private firms. The findings of the survey were discussed in a joint workshop
with the GOM and the private sector and the following policy measures were
identified as priorities to assist the private sector:
* Accelerated Processing of Temporary Employment Permits:
Starting in 1994, the approval and renewal of Temporary
Employment Permits (TEPs) slowed because of public concerns
over observed abuses of TEPs for remitting foreign exchange and
perceived inadequate skill transfers from expatriates to local staff.
The long delays and rejections in processing TEPs left many skilled
expatriate workers and managers in limbo. The resulting partial
exodus of expatriates was impeding the normal operation of many



The Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation Program                 31
firms and clouding future investment decisions. In October 1995,
following the first meeting of a consultative forum between the
GOM, the Malawi Investment Promotion Agency (MIPA) and
private sector representatives, clear guidelines were agreed for
processing TEPs, including: routine approval within 30 days,
automatic approval for new investments, transparent requirements
for training and skills transfers to Malawian nationals, and granting
of permanent resident status for long-term expatriates. As a result,
the months-long backlog of applications has been removed.
*  Enhanced Access to Industrial Land:  For years the lack of
serviced and unserviced industrial sites was a significant obstacle to
private investment. A combination of recent public and private
activities should remove the shortage of industrial land.  In
Lilongwe, the Ministry of Lands and Valuations is making available
to investors an area of some 80 hectares (200 serviced plots) on
public lands. The plots can be grouped for larger developments, and
will be available under an accelerated lease procedure that should
take only a week from application to preliminary approval. In
addition, the GOM is making available to investors over 300
unserviced plots in two areas near Lilongwe. In Blantyre, two
industrial sites (90 ha and 150 ha) have been rezoned and surveyed
for serviced and unserviced industrial sites. A private industrial
estate (110 serviced plots on 100 ha) has recently opened in
Blantyre.
-  Removal of Discriminatory Laws and Practices against Asians:
The GOM realizes that a number of practices and laws that
discriminate against race, gender, and religion, conflict with
Malawi's new Constitution and are significant barriers to
investments. The GOM has reviewed existing laws and removed
discriminatory references; most notably the GOM approved the
repeal of Article 3a of the Business Licensing Act, which limited
Malawian citizens of Asian origin to trading only within designated
business districts in the four major towns. The relevant Amendment
Bill to the Act has been forwarded to Parliament for approval.
Deconcentration
5.39  Following the May 1994 elections, the issue of control over the Press
Trust (de facto owned by the former President) assumed great political
significance. For the first time, the question of whether the Press Trust should
be seen as essentially a parastatal or a private institution became a real issue
since the private control of the Press Trust had formerly been indistinguishable
from the State itself. The challenge is to change this distorted and opaque



32                                                           Chapter 5
arrangement without undermining the real economic strength which Press
represents. On balance, subject to rigorous divestiture in specific sectors (such
as the financial sector) and to changes which broaden the membership of the
Board of Directors, the GOM has concluded (and we agree) that it is in the
interest of Malawi to leave Press largely intact to focus on its core operating
businesses. It is generally recognized that Press's economic success represents a
valuable source of momentum for the development of the Malawi economy and
that, once refocussed on its core activities, it can become an engine powering
Malawi's economic development.
5.40  Progress between January and October 1995 was encouraging with a
mediator trying to move the two sides (the new GOM and the former President)
close to an agreement which would have depoliticized the parent Trust.
However, negotiations stalled over a final issue: the former President sought a
higher compensation than the GOM was willing to consider. Subsequently, the
GOM obtained Parliament's approval of the Press Trust Reconstruction Bill
under an emergency procedure (presentation of the Bill and approval on the
same day) to put in place the arrangements that had tentatively been agreed
before negotiations stalled. Because approval was obtained without allowing the
customary time (21 days) for a bill to be tabled, the now opposition and former
President's party walked out of Parliament. The GOM justified the emergency
procedure as necessary to avoid siphoning of funds by the former President's
party, but has been criticized widely, including by donors, for not having
followed democratic procedures. This is an area we will keep monitoring
closely while--jointly with other donors--we try to convince the GOM as well as
the opposition to return to the negotiating table.
5.41  Notwithstanding the deadlock in negotiations, Press and the GOM have
already started to reduce Press's interlinking ownership with the financial sector.
Over the past year Press has reduced its ownership in the two commercial banks
from over 40% each to less than 25% each and 6% of Press' shares were sold to
a foreign-owned insurance company. This will pave the way for restructuring
Press, offering of Press stock on the newly created stockmarket, and focusing the
business on its core strengths and towards a pattern of substantial external
growth in the sub-regional economy.  A new--more balanced--Board of
Directors and a new Board of Trustees have been appointed.
Privatization
5.42  Compared to many other developing countries the parastatal sector in
Malawi--comprising 12 major commercial parastatals and over 200 small and
very small developmental statutory entities, state-owned investments, farms,
guesthouses, etc. accounting for 20% of GDP--has been well managed and for
the most part profitable. However large losses have been incurred by Malawi
Railways, and to a lesser extent by Air Malawi and Viphya Timber Plantations.



The Fiscal Restructuring and Deregulation Program                 33
Some privatization of both ownership and management has taken place over the
past few years. Examples of this are the divestiture of some of ADMARC's
investments, and of some of MDC's portfolio, and, most recently, the
restructuring and future privatization of Malawi Railways which is supported by
an IDA project.
5.43  The new GOM started a rigorous privatization effort in late 1994, when
the newly-elected President appointed a Privatization Commission chaired by
the First Vice President (cum  Minister of Statutory Corporations).  The
Commission, which has 19 members representing all political parties in
Parliament, the private sector, and relevant government departments, was
charged with developing the strategy for privatization in Malawi. Supported by
the GOM and IDA, the Commission has made considerable progress along three
main directions: (a) a legal framework for privatization; (b) an institutional set
up to deliver privatization; (c) and an inventory of State Owned Enterprises
(SOEs) and a preliminary action plan for privatization.
5.44  The legal framework consists of the GOM's policy paper, a Privatization
Bill to be submitted to Parliament in Spring of 1996, and detailed operational
procedures for privatization currently being prepared. The framework provides
a fair, transparent, competitive and yet efficient fundament for privatization in
Malawi, and has drawn on best practice examples from the region, the entire
continent, Latin America and Asia.
5.45  The institutional setup draws upon maximum use of the private sector.
Implementation of privatization will be delegated from Cabinet to the
Commission, which will delegate implementation to a Privatization Transaction
Unit, consisting of about 4 high quality professionals on 2-3 year contracts and
with performance-related compensation. The Unit's Executive Director has
been recruited locally and has been appointed. The Unit will orchestrate
individual transactions by using consultants for preparation, for studies of
regulatory concentration or monopoly issues (where necessary), and for
implementing the actual transaction. This Unit can manage privatization in
Malawi such that the program progresses quickly without compromising quality
or the interest of Malawi.
5.46  The potential benefits from  privatization are considerable.   Of
approximately 230 SOEs in Malawi, about 40 are non-commercial and will be
integrated in the appropriate line ministry for reporting and financing or will be
liquidated. The remaining assets include many small inns, farms, Telecom, Air
Malawi and the portfolios of ADMARC and MDC. The preliminary plan is to
prepare for privatization virtually all of MDC's and ADMARC's investments
over 3-5 years, and to divest (to farmers and smallholders) the crop authorities,
farms and ranches over 2-3 years. In parallel, it is envisaged to study the
competitive and regulatory situation for utilities and the largest corporations

such that privatization (or concessions and management contracts) can begin in
1997/98 and be concluded within 5 years.
6. THE PROPOSED CREDIT
CONDITIONALITIES: BORROWER-IDA CONTRACT
6.1   There have been no significant changes in the design of the FRDP since
approval of the Initiating Memorandum by the Loan Committee on November
13, 1995. The GOM has met all actions required for Board Presentation. The
main actions taken in preparation of the FRDP are presented in the following
Table (details on policy measures are presented in Annex E: Matrix of Policy
Actions). The macroeconomic developments in FY95/96 were broadly on target
and consistent with the framework agreed under the 6th PFP. In addition, the
GOM has reached agreement with the Bank and IMF on a macroeconomic
framework for FY96/97.
6.2   Disbursement against the Second Tranche (Civil Service Reform
Tranche) would be triggered by:
(a)   satisfactory implementation and deepening of the overall
adjustment program;
(b)   continuation  of macroeconomic  policies  conducive  to
adjustment and in line with fiscal and monetary targets
agreed under the 6th PFP;
(c)   implementation of an Action Plan agreed with IDA for
comprehensive civil service reform as presented in the Letter
of Development Policy.

SUPERVISION PLAN
Supervision Focus
6.3   IDA  will review  implementation of the overall program  as well as
specific actions outlined in the GOM's LDP. Because most policy actions
supported by the FRDP have already been implemented, the focus of supervision
will be on deepening the impact of adjustment and identification of policy
measures that could possibly be supported under a follow-on quick-disbursing
operation (Table 6.2: FRDP - Focus of Supervision). The envisaged timetable
for medium-term policy implementation in the areas of expenditure reform, civil
service reform, land policy, maize pricing policy, and privatization is presented
in Annex F: Supervision Chart.

Organization and Timing of Supervision Activities
6.4    Supervision of the FRDP will involve 40 staff weeks (30 staff weeks in
FY97, and 10 staff weeks in FY98). The responsibility for supervising the
FRDP will be coordinated by the Task Manager (from the Macro, Industry and
Finance Division in the Southern Africa Department) in close collaboration with
(a) the coordinator of the Malawi Agricultural Program in AFl's Agriculture
and Environment Division, and (b) the Economist in the Resident Mission, who
has  been  involved  in  the  preparation  of the  FRDP.   Regarding  the
macroeconomic framework, restoring fiscal balance while improving the
effectiveness of government spending will be critical for the success of the
overall stabilization effort. As the MTEF will be extended to other ministries,
monitoring of expenditure allocations will be possible. Close collaboration will
be maintained with IMF staff on monitoring macroeconomic developments and
sequencing of structural measures in the PFP. Contact with the private sector,
other stakeholder groups, and donors will be the responsibility of the Task
Manager. The first supervision mission is planned for May 1996 to launch the
program. The next supervision mission will be approximately six months later.
It is likely that that mission will be combined with a performance review, before
release of the Second Tranche.



The Proposed Credit                                             37
Performance Indicators
6.5   Performance indicators have been identified during Appraisal, and will
be monitored during supervision to assess whether the program's potential
development impact is being achieved or whether policy corrections are
indicated. This is in line with the GOM's commitment to monitor the impact of
policies on economic performance, poverty reduction and social conditions.
Trends in the selected indicators would also feed into the preparation of possible
follow-on operations. The GOM, in collaboration with supervision missions,
will collect periodic information on the indicators and track developments over
time. The performance indicators in Table 6.3 will serve as proxies to gauge the
impact of the FRDP. Policy indicators monitor the policy and institutional
actions required to implement the adjustment program.   Intermediate
indicators track the impact on stabilization, structural change and the provision
of social services. Outcome indicators monitor progress towards the ultimate
objectives of growth, poverty reduction and better social conditions.
Borrower's Contribution to Supervision
6.6   The Ministry of Finance will have overall responsibility for managing
the program, and for monitoring and reporting responsibilities as described in
this report. Administrative arrangements for IDA supervision missions, as well
as discussion of the results of supervision will be managed by the Ministry. The
social impact of the adjustment program will be monitored in conjunction with
the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development, specifically with the
Poverty Monitoring Unit. As part of supervision and implementation, the GOM
will meet frequently with beneficiary groups, including exporters, private
sectors, and smallholder farmers.
CREDIT ADMINISTRATION
Coordinating Agency
6.7   The coordinating agency is the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) which
would administer the Credit on behalf of the GOM and disburse funds through
the interbank market.  The RBM  has extensive previous experience in
coordinating import programs and will assure compliance with the agreed
disbursement arrangements. RBM is adequately staffed to undertake these
duties which it has discharged effectively under previous adjustment operations.

Financing Plan
6.8    A total of SDR 73.2 million (US$106.4 million equivalent) is expected
to be provided under the proposed IDA Credit of which SDR 2.9 million have
been allocated from  IDA  Reflows.  Substantial co-financing and parallel
financing is expected under the Special Program of Assistance from the
Governments of Germany, Japan, and possibly, Denmark and Sweden.
6.9    Except for consultancy services, the proposed IDA Credit would be
disbursed as follows: an initial tranche of SDR 50.9 million (US$74.4 million
equivalent) including the allocation from IDA Reflows would be made available
upon Credit effectiveness and the remaining amount of SDR 21 million



The Proposed Credit                                               39
(US$30 million equivalent) would be disbursed upon meeting the conditions
related to civil service reforms (Second Tranche Conditions). SDR 1.3 million
(US$2 million equivalent) would be available for consultancy services in
connection with implementation of agricultural pricing and marketing, tax and
tariff reform, introduction of a VAT and National Revenue Authority, and
facilitation of beneficiaries consultations to discuss the impact of policy
measures and increase understanding of the GOM's economic program. The
amount allocated from IDA Reflows would be used within 12 months of the date
of signing the legal documents of the Credit.
Disbursement and Audit
6.10  Simplified Disbursement Procedures under Adjustment Credits will
apply. The Borrower will open an account in the Central Bank. Upon IDA
notification of tranche release for each tranche, proceeds of the credit will be
deposited by IDA in this account at the request of the Borrower. If after deposit
in this account, the proceeds of the credit are used for ineligible purposes (to
finance items imported from non-member countries, or goods or services in the
standard negative list) IDA will require the Borrower to either (a) return that
amount to the account for use for eligible purposes; or (b) refund the amount
directly to IDA, in which case IDA will cancel an equivalent undisbursed
amount of the credit. Although routine audit of the account will not be required,
IDA reserves the right to require it. A summary on the disbursement status of
the IDA portfolio is attached (Annex G: Disbursement Performance).
6.11  The Borrower shall open a Special Account with a commercial bank of
its choice under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA, in which US$500,000
for consultant services will be deposited. All applications to withdraw proceeds
for consultants services will be fully documented, except for expenditures of
contracts with an estimated value of US$100,000 or less for consulting firms,
and US$50,000 or less for individual consultants which may be claimed on the
basis of certified Statements of Expenditures.  Documentation supporting
expenditures claimed against Statements of Expenditures would be retained by
the Reserve Bank and will be available for review as requested by IDA
supervision missions. Upon IDA's request, the Borrower shall have the deposit
account and the Special Account audited, in accordance with appropriate
auditing principles consistently applied, by independent auditors acceptable to
IDA. The Borrower shall furnish to IDA as soon as available, but in any case
not later than nine months after the date of IDA's request for such audit, a
certified copy of the report of such audit of such scope and in such detail as IDA
shall reasonably request.

Procurement Procedures
6.12  Selection of consultants shall be carried out in accordance with
"Guidelines for the use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the
World Bank as Executing Agency" (dated August 1981).  Selection of
consultants shall be subject to IDA prior review as follows: (a) contracts with
consulting firms or individuals to be awarded on the basis of competitive
selection respectively valued at $100,000 and $50,000 or higher; (b) all sole-
sourced contracts; (c) all TOR; and (d) amendments to contracts resulting in
final values higher than $100,000 with consulting firms, and $50,000 with
individuals.
BENEFITS
6.13   The poor will benefit from the redirection of public resources towards
their needs and from reduced inflation. With regard to gender-specific benefits.
the removal of all primary school fees has had a favorable impact on girls'
enrollment rate (increasing gross enrollment from 75% to 96%), laying the
foundation for higher literacy rates among women and having long-run
implications such as increased female-business ownership or lower fertility
rates. Improved access to cash crops and alternative marketing channels should
increase smallholder household income. Small businesses and the informal
sector will gain through incremental cash injected in the rural economy as a
result of expanded smallholder cash crop production.  Exporters will gain
through increased incentives for agricultural diversification, helping the
economy to reduce its dependency on tobacco (from currently 66% of export
revenues to about 50% by the year 2005) and creating additional employment
opportunities. Credible action in investment promotion and privatization will
attract foreign investment beyond the actual program period, thus creating
employment, helping diversify the economy, and improving fiscal revenues. A
restructured and smaller civil service will allow GOM to increase civil service
salaries in line with private sector comparators, thus retaining qualified staff and
increasing motivation and public sector efficiency.
RISKS
Implementation Risks
6.14  The GOM faces a weighty agenda and its political willpower will be
continuously tested. Actions taken so far clearly signal the GOM's commitment
to poverty reduction and macroeconomic stabilization. In all policy areas,
preparatory work was carried out by the GOM and implementation of critical
measures is on track, thus reducing the risk of back-pedalling on key issues. The



The Proposed Credit                                               41
following residual implementation risks can be reduced to levels similar to those
associated with many of IDA's successful programs.
Failure to Contain the Civil Service Wage Bill
6.15  In a country where three civil service strikes were called within one year,
continued pressure by civil servants for higher wages is likely. If the nominal
increase in the aggregate wage bill was 30% instead of the projected
19% between 1996 and 1997 (Low Case Scenario I) the budgetary financing
gap would increase by the equivalent of US$20 million. The fiscal deficit would
increase by approximately 2% of GDP in 1996, though real growth would be
slightly higher in 1997 compared to the base case (Table 6.4: Sensitivity
Analysis - Macroeconomic Scenarios). The risk will be managed through
bilateral negotiations between the GOM and the Civil Servants Union. The
resolution of the August 1995 civil service strike is indicative of GOM's
determination to offset higher civil service salaries only with parallel reduction
and restructuring of the civil service size. This risk is further mitigated by the
agreement between the GOM and the Civil Servant Union to postpone wage
negotiations and implementation of the recommendations of the report on civil
service pay (Chatsika Report) until the results of the Civil Service Census are
available.
Political Resistance and Vested Interests
6.16 Notwithstanding the GOM's commitment across the full spectrum of
structural reforms, there is always the risk of political pressure by special
interest groups. Civil servants and parastatal employees are likely to object to
retrenchment programs under civil service reform or privatization. Although
extensive stakeholder involvement will help reduce resistance from special
interest groups (and the GOM's communication strategy will help build broad-
based consensus), residual risks remain. These will be managed by reaching
agreement on end-of-service and severance benefits packages. The recently
completed staff retrenchment program of Malawi Railways has set a precedent
by which future retrenchment packages in the public and parastatal sector might
be measured. For civil service retrenchment, the proposed Credit will provide
the necessary resources on a "just-in-time" basis through the Second Tranche
which will be triggered by an acceptable civil service reform package, thus,
preventing a situation in which expenditures for civil servant retrenchment
impinge on the implementation of social sector programs.
Impact of Food Price Increase on the Poor
6.17  After the initial round of maize price increases (following the 1995 move
to a maize price band) it is possible that further liberalization will result in future



42                                                           Chapter 6
jumps in maize prices. This would adversely affect food deficit households and
receive significant attention from civil society and critics of adjustment
programs--and could eventually lead to the reversal of liberalization policy
under popular pressure. This risk will be managed through a mix of stakeholder
consultations, targeted pro-poor activities (such as public works, targeted input
distribution programs, and supplemental food programs), and drawdown from
the Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR). In years with production shortages, price
increases would be buffered by sales from the SGR. If excess demand remains,
the consumer price would be maintained at or below import parity level through
liberalized private sector imports. In extreme drought years, undue hardship to
the poor can only be prevented through public food distribution programs--
transparently funded through the budget and in part or in total financed by
donors.
Outcome Risks
6.18  Even if Malawi does all the right things, vulnerability to external shocks
will persist. The risk of drought is by far the highest and the least controllable of
such shocks. The Base Case scenario projects a relatively low growth rate of
4% as it incorporates the effects of possible droughts, albeit mild ones, on
income and production (on average one moderate drought in four years).
6.19  In the short term, the impact of a major drought cannot be offset by
shifting external resources alone or by relying on substantial donor grants;
additional aggregate demand management would be necessary to stay within the
agreed fiscal framework. Some mitigating measures are being taken to reduce
the burden on the poor; the MTEF will help to protect expenditure allocations in
the social sectors and will identify low-priority areas from which to reallocate
expenditures to drought-related operations. Over the medium term--and for a
limited number of households--the proposed expansion of the smallholder
tobacco quota is a measure to improve drought vulnerability. Over the longer
term, the GOM and IDA intend to address drought vulnerability through a more
systematic and integrated effort to promote alternative crops, disseminate
alternative technologies and foster increased non-farm activities.
6.20  Although Malawi's terms-of-trade are expected to remain broadly stable,
there is always the risk that world market prices may shift unexpectedly
particularly in the tobacco market (Low Case Scenario 2). As long as the
decline in export prices is moderate (10%) Malawi will be able to compensate
for the shock through reduced accumulation of foreign reserves and if need be
through the IMF's Compensatory Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF).
However, lower tobacco revenues to the private sector would negatively affect
private sector investment in 1996 and would somewhat reduce real growth in
1997 compared to the base case (Table 6.4:   Sensitivity Analysis -
Macroeconomic Scenarios).

64                                               Disbursement Performance
ANNEX G: DISBURSEMENT PERFORMANCE
The Bank/IDA portfolio in Malawi currently contains 17 projects.  The
disbursement factor (disbursements divided by the approved amount net of
cancellations and previous years' disbursements) has fallen from 36% in FY93
to 32% in FY95 and only 15% for the first seven months of FY96. Generic
issues affecting project implementation have included: i) procurement
difficulties stemming from a shortage of qualified staff and frequent turnover of
existing staff, weakness in the Tender Board, and delays in reaching agreement
on clauses of standard bidding contracts; ii) problems with counterpart funding
as a result of fiscal pressures; iii) slow or incomplete preparation of
reimbursement documentation, especially where implementing agencies have
access to up-front budgetary financing; and, iv) a pattern of very slow project
start ups reflecting a tendency on the part of the Government and the Bank to
overestimate local implementation capacity.
At the February 1996 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR), the
Govermment and the Bank agreed on a number of initiatives to improve project
performance and disbursements. A Public Procurement Reform Study will be
executed under an ongoing operation. Agreement was reached on a schedule of
procurement seminars and workshops and updated procurement plans will be
prepared for ongoing operations. The prioritization of activities under the
MTEF is expected to assist in rectifying the counterpart funding problem.
Finally, Government intends to strengthen disbursement practices by
institutional strengthening of the Ministry of Finance Claims Unit, while the
Bank will strengthen the role of the Resident Mission in project supervision.
Projects with disbursement lags of over 50% or other disbursement-related
issues are described in more detail below.
Power V.
Donors withdrew support for the project shortly after project approval, in
protest against human rights abuses under the Banda regime and in support of
pressure for democracy. Implementation was delayed 18 months. The project
is now proceeding satisfactorily, although an extension of the closing date is
likely to be necessary to compensate for the 18 month delay.
Rural Financial Services:
Project effectiveness was delayed by 15 months as a result of a breakdown in
credit discipline following the 1994 elections and difficulties in completing the
recruitment of staff and legal documentation for the newly established Malawi
Rural Finance Corporation. During the 1994-95 season, lending was limited
by the large number of ineligible borrowers and a shortage of fertilizer
supplies. The project closing date may need to be extended to compensate for
the initial delays and permit steps to privatize MRFC. Still, lending has
accelerated and the project is proceeding satisfactorily.

Fisheries Development Project:
The single greatest constraint limiting performance is the lack of an effective
project management and administration system. Disbursement problems are
directly linked to poor procurement planning (no major civil works have been
completed during the first four years), though improvements have been made
during the last year. The earlier restructuring was never really effected. This
project is a problem project; a mid-term review in March will propose
remedial measures.
PHN Sector Credit.
Project implementation was originally delayed at the Bank's instigation as
discussions continued on the issue of rural focus. The project suffered from a
series of personnel issues, including: (i) numerous shifts at the Permanent
Secretary level; (ii) very slow recruitment of project staff; (iii) the lack of a
Project Coordinator for several months; (iv) the death of Project Accountant,
which resulted in a backlog of outstanding invoices; and, (v) staff salary issues
affecting the Project Implementation Unit, which were resolved only recently.
A number of procurement and disbursement issues have also caused delays.
These issues have now been largely resolved and project implementation is
expected to improve.
Institutional Development II.
The Malawi Institute of Management (MIM) component of the project, which
constitutes 33% of all project funding, was not effective until June, 1995 (six
months behind schedule). The slow start was caused by delays in the hiring of
a professionally qualified accountant. The project was further delayed by the
need for resequencing of some consultancies and procurement, as a result of
slippage. After the initial delays, the project is proceeding satisfactorily.
Ag Services.'
The move to a cash budget which caused the closing or combination of a
number of Government accounts also slowed allocations to implementing
parties. In addition, a significant percentage of project expenditures are
kwacha denominated local costs. With the devaluation of the currency, the
actual amount of US dollars being disbursed fell dramatically, even though the
kwacha expenditures remained the same. However, the situation has improved
significantly, with the disbursement lag falling from over 60% to 38% between
July and December, 1995. Disbursements are on track according to the revised
disbursement schedule (updated each mission) and no need for restructuring is
forecast.

Local Government:
This project got off to a slow start as a result of a combination of project
conditions and market forces. A central condition of the project was that
onlending rates to local governments be linked to market rates. However,
early in the project interest rates increased significantly to levels beyond what
local governments were willing to bear. This issue has been resolved and
project implementation is improving. A mid-term review is scheduled for
May, 1996.

Mr. James Wolfensohn
President
International Development Association
1818H Street, NW
Washington D.C. 20433
USA
Dear Mr. President,
RE: FISCAL RESTRUCTURING AND DEREGULATION PROGRAM
1.    I am writing to request on behalf of the Malawi Govemment a Credit of
US$106.4 million from the International Development Association (IDA) in support
of our program of Structural Adjustment. This will be the first adjustment program
designed and implemented by the democratically-elected Govemment, after 30 years
of one-party rule. The structural reforms anchored in a medium-term strategy as
reflected in the 6th Policy Framework Paper are supported by a three-year
arrangement under the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. The program
is designed to support a critical new phase in Malawi's continuing macroeconomic
reform program, aimed at the dual strategy of ensuring stability in the macro-economic
fundamentals to allow economic growth with poverty reduction. The cornerstone of
this phase of the program is a far-ranging overhaul of public expenditure planning and
management, with a view to raising allocations in pro-poor expenditure categories
while reducing the absolute level of public spending. In addition, the proposed
program supports policy measures that will allow the poor to participate in the full
range of economic activities especially in the agricultural sector.



2.    The requested Credit will provide the needed financing to:  (i) help fill
Malawi's projected external financing gap through 1996/97; (ii) provide budgetary
support for critical expenditures in the social sectors and a substantial net repayment
to the domestic banking system; and (iii) smooth consumption to lessen the cost of
stabilization and prevent undue hardship to the poor.
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
3.    Since 1981, Malawi has undertaken six adjustment operations, reflecting a
pattem of recurrent periods of short-lived economic recovery and growth which were
halted or reversed by external shocks followed by economic recessions. Although
these repeated periods of economic recovery earned Malawi the reputation as a "strong
adjuster", sustainable and broad-based growth has remained elusive.
4.    The pre-1994 Government's lack of comrnitment to poverty alleviation,
combined with Malawi's vulnerability to recurrent external shocks, forestalled any
sustained and comprehensive transformation of the economy. Until a few years ago,
Malawi's economy, and in particular the smallholder agricultural sector, was among
the most regulated private sectors in Africa. Marketing and production restrictions
excluded smallholders from growing profitable cash crops (especially burley tobacco)
and from competing with the privileged estate sector. Until 1987, the marketing
monopsony of Agricultural Development and Marketing Corporation (ADMARC)
effectively taxed the smallholder sub-sector and prevented entry by private traders.
Expanding tobacco exports provided a thin veneer of growth (almost exclusively in
the estate sector) that concealed a fragile and narrow macroeconomic base, highly
skewed income distribution, and lack of economic diversification.
5.    The formal sector became increasingly dominated by a few public and private
conglomerates, such as Press Corporation, Lonrho, ADMARC, and Malawi
Development Corporation (MDC). Concentration of property ownership in the



economy reinforced the increasingly autocratic political regime. A small number of
Malawians became rich and powerful, while the lives of the vast majority became
worse.
6.    With the political transition in Malawi the odds for successful structural
reforms, compared to previous programs, have substantially improved. In contrast
to the previous regime, the new Government has firmly demonstrated its commitment
to policy reform and has followed through in both word and deed to reduce the
country's pervasive poverty levels.   Within weeks of the 1994 elections, the new
Govemment acted on a campaign promise and announced the removal of all primary
school fees. This resulted in a dramatic, and largely unexpected, increase in the
number of primary students from 1.9 million to over 3 million, with more equitable
enrollment across gender, regions and household income levels. The Government's
seriousness about putting poverty alleviation in the center of its development agenda
was translated into a Poverty Alleviation Program.
7.    In addition, the new Government of Malawi has begun to address a wide range
of structural, economic, and social issues that have impeded progress toward self-
sustained growth and poverty alleviation. Through the preparation of a Privatization
Policy Framework, the Government has launched a broad-based private sector
development.  The new  agricultural strategy commits Malawi to far-reaching
deregulation and the promotion of smallholder development. In early 1995, marketing
restrictions on smallholder tobacco growers were lifted and smallholder tobacco quotas
were de facto replaced by a registration system to benefit the poor. Fixed producer
and consumer prices for maize were replaced by a market-oriented price band; this
should improve efficiency in production and mark-eting of maize and other food crops
and help promote crop diversification and food security.
8.    I wish to higlhlight here that the aforementioned structural reform process and
the new Government's macroeconomic management was challenged from the first day
in office by: (i) a series of civil service strikes; (ii) the deterioration of fiscal
management during the months leading up to the elections; and (iii) the additional



financing requirements to hire 22,000 additional teachers and provide textbooks to
accommodate the "overnight" increase in enrollment after removal of primary school
fees. The new Government acted accordingly and began to implement a series of
corrective measures in the latter part of 1994 and in the context of the 1995/96 budget.
I am happy to report that over the past year, we have made good progress in achieving
macroeconomic stabilization.  Since April 1995, public expenditures are being
controlled under a cash budgeting system. The Government has let market forces
determine the exchange rate and has resisted popular pressures to reverse the floatation
of the Kwacha (February 1994), even when the Kwacha depreciated by 100% in
October 1994. The exchange rate has been stable in the last 12 months. The Reserve
Bank- of Malawi has been successful in smoothening seasonal fluctuations in foreign
exchange demand and supply and, aided by tobacco earnings, had accumulated official
reserves equivalent to more than 4 months of imports by end December 1995 which
was well above the target of 0.7 months of imports stipulated under the ESAF
program. Reflecting the Government's continued commitment to further liberalize the
payments and exchange system, Malawi, on December 7, 1995, acceded to Article
VIE of the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund. Thus, effective
this date, Malawi no longer applies restrictions on  current account transactions.
Additionally the rate of inflation has continued to decelerate from a monthly average
of 11.0 percent in the fourth quarter, 1994, down to 6.3 percent per month during, the
last three months to end January, 1996. We are confident that the macroeconomic
improvement will be sustained and are ready to embark on an even more ambitious
effort of structural reforms.
GOVYERNNIENT'S MIEDMNI-TERMI POLICY FRA NIEWORK
9.    Economic management in the near term  wvill continue to focus on
macroeconomic stabilization to reduce fiscal imbalances and lower the inflation rate.
The medium-term strategy places greater emphasis on policies and structural reforms
to consolidate past reforms and provide a lasting framework for macroeconomic



stability. Greater efforts will be made to promote domestic savings and investment,
accelerate economic diversification, raise average productivity across all sectors,
enhance  domestic  competition, and  improve external competitiveness.   The
Government program aims to strengthen performance in the productive sectors through
the removal of remaining distortions in pricing and market structures that suppress
incentives and competition. Agriculture will continue to be a major source of growth,
providing employment and subsistence for some 80% of the population and
comprising the main source of primary inputs for the manufacturing sector. In the
agricultural sector farmers will have incentives to take advantage of opportunities
brought about by more efficient use of fertilizer and the adoption of high-yielding
maize varieties, the removal of restrictions on the production of lucrative cash crops,
including burley, agricultural diversification and more efficient use of currently
underutilized lands; as well as addressing the Govemment's institutional weaknesses
that constrain the supply and deliverv of inputs, credit and extension services. Growth
ir. the manufacturing sector is expected to be supported by a liberalized exchange
system, the rationalization of external tariffs, the reduction in external transport costs
as direct routes to Nlozambican ports will become fully operational, and an expansion
of the agriculture sector.  The investment required for the diversification of
manufacturing output and increased exports of manufactured goods will also depend
on the success of efforts to broaden the ownership base and remove barriers to ently.
The Government realizes that industrial supply response will be accelerated only if
efficiency and competition are increased by promoting free and competitive markets
and by addressing the highly concentrated and inter-locking ownership structure that
characterizes the trade, distribution, manufacturing, and finance sectors.  The
continued development of human resources and investments in the social and physical
infrastmicture will constitute critical elements of the development strategy.
10.   The overall macroeconomic objectives for the period 1996-1998 are: (i) a
recovery in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth to an average of over 4.5
percent per annum; (ii) a sharp, early deceleration in the rate of inflation, with a
decline to an average annual rate of less than 10% from 1998 onward; (iii) a reduction



in external imbalances beyond 1996 with a view to attaining a more sustainable
balance of payments position over the medium term; and (iv) the accommodation of
pressing social needs within the constraint of fiscal sustainability by prioritizing
Government expenditures in the context of a medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF). Expected substantial improvement in domestic savings and continued
progress in structural reforms will significantly enhance long-run growth prospects.
However, continued progress will require donor support in the form of external
concessional resources over the medium term.
11.   Expenditure policies will be guided by the dual objective of achieving the
targeted improvement in the Government's financial position and the necessary
reorientation of current expenditures towards a greater emphasis on outlays in key
social sectors and the efficient delivery of services. To achieve this, the Government
will expand the work already begun in several Ministries and, from 1996/97 onward,
prepare a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. The central Government investment
program will be rationalized to ensure that the selection of investment projects is
consistent with Malawi's development priorities. To complement these efforts, wage
policy will be strengthened by the ongoing reforms aiming at rationalizing the civil
service and establishing an adequate remuneration structure. Additionally, having
phased out fertilizer subsidies, Government will maintain its policy of giving no
subsidies to commercial public enterprises. On the revenue side Government's overall
goal is to increase the revenue/GDP ratio from 16.2 percent in 1994/95 to 18.0 percent
in  1997/98.   To achieve this objective, Government intends to undertake
comprehensive reform of indirect taxes coupled with improvements in tax
administration. External sector policies will aim at maintaining competitiveness and
moving towards medium term balance of pavments viability. Monetary policy will
aim at achieving and sustaining a low rate of inflation, consistent with the overall
growth and balance of payments objectives. In order to strengthen Malawi's capacity
to implement macroeconomic and related structural reform, the Government has
developed the National Capacity Building Program for Economic and Financial
Management.



THE FISCAL RESTRUCTURING AND DEREGULATION PROGRAM
12.   Government has identified two binding constraints to the achievement of these
goals: (i) the past anti-poor bias and low quality of social sector expenditures; and
(ii) restrictions and regulations that prevent the poor from participating in the full
range of economic activities. In order to achieve our set objectives and succeed in
alleviating the country's pervasive poverty problem, the proposed program focuses on
fiscal restructuring and deregulation.
FISCAL RESTRUCTURING
13.   Expenditure Reoiientation. Under the program, a MIedium Term Expenditure
Framework is being developed with support from IDA to help Ministries prioritize
inter-sectoral and intra-sectoral expenditures within the agreed overall macro-economic
expenditure envelope. The program will help ensure that both the targeted fiscal
deficit reduction and the concurrent expansion of social services are achieved
rationally  without compromising Govemment's pro-poor policy focus.   The
Govemment is aiming to protect the recent increase in the Ministry of Education's
share (22% in 1995196) in total recurrent expenditures and subsequently increase it to
25% with the 1996/97 budget, and broadly maintain this level in the future. The share
of primary education within recurrent expenditures of the NMinistry of Education will
be increased from 47% in 1995/96 to at least 66% in 1996/97. Similarly, the
expenditure share on primary health care is expected to increase from 8% in 1994/95
to not less than 14% in 1996/97 and reach an allocation for medical supplies and
medicines equivalent to US$1.25 per capita by 1997/98. Within total recurrent
expenditures for health care services 7% will be allocated to Family Planning Services
in 1996/97. The share of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development in
total recurrent expenditures will be maintained at around 4% - 5% of total recurrent
expenditures with about 40% of this being allocated to extension services to ensure
that an increasing share of smallholder farmers is being reached. Within the recurrent



expenditures allocation to the Ministry of Works (about 5% of total recurrent
expenditures) emphasis will be given to road maintenance and rural roads (50% of the
Ministry's recurrent budget).
14.   The Medium Term Expenditure Framework will be rolled out over the next six
months to all ministries in preparation for the 1997/1998 budget. In this context,
lessons learned from the pilot phase of the MTEF will be applied.
(a)    First, the Audit and Finance Committee of Permanent Secretaries will
provide guidance to the MTEF Task Force.  Tentative sectoral
expenditure envelopes will be discussed by the Cabinet Committee on
the Economy in early June 1996.  Indicative sectoral expenditure
ceilings will be given to line ministries for the next three fiscal years
by June 30, 1996.
(b)    Second, increased focus will be put on the medium-term  aspects
whereby tentative expenditure needs and shares will be developed for
a three-year rolling period. In this regard, by October 1996, ministries
will carry out a line-by-line review of functions and identify those
programs that will be phased out, functions that will be outsourced to
the private sector, and those priority functions for which funding levels
would be increased.
(c)    Third, line ministries will take into account changes in civil service
staffing levels that will allow a reallocation of: (i) civil servants from
low priority areas to high priority areas; and (ii) resources from the
wages and salaries category to goods and services.
(d)   Fourth, the links between the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP)
and the MTEF will be strengthened. In particular, the PSIP will be
rationalized in the context of the MTEF to ensure that the selection of



investment projects is consistent with pro-poor development priorities
and recurrent expenditure capacities. Government investment as share
in GDP is targeted to be maintained between 7% and 8% over the
medium-term.
(e)    Fifth, the Government intends to integrate the recurrent and capital
budgets.  For the 1997/98 budget, this integration is envisaged to be
completed for the four MTEF pilot ministries.
(f)    Sixth, the program costing exercise will be improved , inter alia,
through preparation of a MTEF manual.
15.   Expenditure stabilization. In the short-term Govemment will continue with the
cash budget system  in order to effectively control expenditures.  This is being
supported by: (i) a monitoring system to ensure that cash books are kept up to date
and reconcilcd with bank statements; (ii) the developmenc of a financial management
information system (FMIS) to permit continuous monitoring of commitments; and (iii)
periodic reconciliation of Government's accounts wvith parastatals to prevent
accumulation of arrears.
16.   Civil Service Refonn. In recent years, the size of the civil service has grown
considerably, adding to the growth in the wage bill and fiscal pressures. Civil service
productivitv has not kept pace, as is reflected in the weak public sector management
and implementation capacity. Government considers a comprehensive civil service
reform of major importance for the purpose of fiscal stabilization and restructuring
expenditures so as to increase the efficiency of public service delivery. Under the
Second Institutional Development Project supported by the Bank, Government is
addressing some critical civil service reform issues, aiming at the strengthening of the
personnel function, pay reform and training and skills development. A civil service
census has been carried out to provide reliable benchmark data for an effective
personnel management and control system. Government expects that the analysis of
the census results will be completed by mid-April 1996 and that the payroll will be



harmonized with the civil service census file from April 1996 onward. The overall
objective of these reform measures is the enhancement of the efficiency and
effectiveness of the civil service to ensure improved service delivery to the public.
It is Government's objective to achieve a civil service size and remuneration structure
that is consistent with a sustainable civil service wage bill of about 7% of GDP.
17.   Because of the burden of the wage bill on the budget and Government's
commitment to attain fiscal stabilization, several short-term measures were introduced
during the past eight months to contain civil service wages.  In July 1995, the
Govemment reviewed the cost-effectiveness of its overseas representations and is now
starting to reduce the number of diplomatic staff posted abroad. Funded vacancies
that have remained unfilled for more than five years have been frozen and in August,
1995. Government started to remove these vacancies from the establishment. Between
Februaxy and September 1995, the Government retrenched about 20,000 civil servants
in non-established and temporary positions in non-priority areas, for instance, unskilled
laborers, cooks, gardeners, bricklayers, plumbers, drivers, messengers, janitors.
18.   The Government is also carrying out analytical work that will broaden and
deepen the scope of civil service reform, including a systematic review of Government
functions and a review of civil service pay and remuneration. The latter study has
been completed and is currently being discussed by Government. The functional
review is at an interim stage and is expected to be finalized by end April 1996. It is
apparent that some ministries and departments are overstaffed, with considerable
duplication of functions, while critical personnel categories such as health  (i.e.
doctors) remain understaffed. An Interministerial Commission has been appointed to
oversee the implementation of the results of the Civil Service Census and prepare the
plan for the next steps in civil service reform taking into account the findings and
conclusions of the functional reviews, relevant recommendations from the Medium
Term Expenditure Framework process and the analytical work relating to pay reform.



19.   We expect to complete the Civil Service Reform Action Plan by September 30,
1996 drawing on the findings and conclusions of the civil service census, the
functional review, the remuneration study and the ongoing MTEF exercise. The
Action Plan will include, inter alia, the following timing and scope of:
(a)    establishment of a personnel information and control system that links
the personnel data to the payroll data based on the census results;
(b)   identification of duplicating and overlapping Government functions that
are currently being carried out by different agencies and
will be eliminated or merged in the future;
(c)    identification of those Government functions that will be privatized or
contracted out to the private sector;
(d)    realignment of civil service staffing levels in line with Government's
pro-poor  focus   and   a   reduction   in   both   Government
programs and functions;
(e)    retrenchment program  including transparent retrenchment criteria,
appropriate safety net measures and quantitative targets for the size of
the civil service;
(f)    identification of cost and source of financing of the civil service
restructuring, retrenchment program, staff separation packages and
safety nets;
(g)    restructuring of the civil service salary structure with improved
incentives and levels of remuneration for a smaller civil service within
a sustainable overall wage bill;



(h)    arrangements  for  implementing   decentralization,  including
interGovernmental fiscal relations; and
(i)    completion of job evaluation exercise with a view to improving the
present recruitment, posting and promotion practices.
20.   The Government will start implementation of the aforementioned Action Plan
and will have completed the following measures before we request release of the
Second Tranche. Starting April 1996, Government shall not pay salaries or wages to
civil servants who are not listed on the civil service census file. By September 30,
1996, we will have completed a detailed review of functions being carried out by
Government departments and ministries and we will have identified those functions
that will be eliminated, contracted out to the private sector or privatized, such as (i)
car and vehicle hire services; (ii) security guard services; (iii) printing services; (iv)
office cleaning services; (v) laundry services in major hospitals; (vi) the operation of
medical stores; (vii) the management of the hotel training school; and (viii) the
management of rest houses and inns. Within the context of the functional review, we
plan to reduce the number of industrial workers and absorb this category into the civil
service. Further, Government plans to adopt a civil service staffing plan which
reflects our poverty alleviation policy in the education and health sectors and which
will (i) focus on training of qualified teachers and lead to a student teacher ratio of
60:1 for primary education; and (ii) achieve adequate staffing of all health clinics with
at least one general nurse and one maternity nurse.  By September 30, 1996,
Government will complete the Civil Service Remuneration Study and will adopt a plan
for revising the civil service salary structure which will include, among other things,
the integration of housing allowances into the wages and salaries. To improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of common services cadres, we will put in place
provisions for adequate authority of line managers in deploying, retaining, and
evaluating performance of common services staff.  In particular, we will have
implemented such measures in respect of two common services cadres by end 1996.



21.   Tax and Tariff Policy. Trade and indirect tax reforms in Malawi have two
objectives: first, to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of the economy, and
particularly of non-traditional exports sectors, and second, protect revenues collected
from indirect taxes as part of restoring tax revenues to the level of around 17% of
GDP over the next two years. GovernmenE appreciates that despite several rounds of
tariff reforms in the past, the tariff levels on many important items continue to be
high, and, equally significant, the tariff structure has become complicated by Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and bilateral trade agreements.
The Government intends to carry out further tariff reforms to (i) increase
competitiveness of local industry and agriculture by lowering tariffs on capital goods,
intermediate inputs and raw materials; (ii) reduce the anti-export bias inherent in the
some rates in the tariff structure; and (iii) ensure that exporters receive effective relief
from border taxes and have access to necessary inputs at competitive world market
prices. The Government appreciates that tax relief to exporters and tariff reductions
have to take place within tax revenue and administrative constraints.  Hence
Government will also undeitake surtax refomis to compensate for losses in revenues
that may take place as both maximum and average import tariffs are lowered as part
of the Government's medium term macroeconomic program and its commitments
under the Cross Border Initiative (CBI).
22.   The Government's target is to reduce tariff rates to a weighted average of 15%
with a maximum rate of 25%. In line with the agreement under the CBI and Uruguay
Round, the number of tariff rates are to be confined to only four rates, including the
zero rate. With the 1996/97 budget, the maximum tariff will be reduced from 45%
to 40%, while average statutory tariff rates will be lowered to around 15%. In
particular, average tariff rates for capital goods, and intermediate goods will be
reduced to less than 15%.
23.   At the same time reforms of tariffs have to be carefully integrated with surtax
reform, including both adjustment of rates and expansion of base, so that Government
revenues can be protected. The goal will be to shift to a base rate of 20% while



allowing for zero rates and exemptions on exports and basic necessities. Increased
reliance on surtaxes, as opposed to tariffs, help in leveling the incentives between
Malawian producers and their external competitors both groups are equally affected
by the surtax. With the forthcoming budget for 1996/97, Government will increase
the surtax to the base rate to service sectors such as the main hotels, restaurants and
other such establishments.                          The single most important
option for broadening surtax is to extend it to wholesale and retail activities. The aim
of the Government is to implement this measure in the 1997/98 fiscal year with a
move to a full-fledged Value Added Tax (VAT) system.
24.   Government has already made good progress in these policy areas. With a
view to promoting exports the Government has implemented the Export Processing
Zone Act, 1995. Duty drawback administration has been simplified in response to
private sector complaints about delays in the reimbursement process. Now exporters
are provided with 100% refund of duties after submission of appropriate documents
within five working days of application. Government has also ensured that the
Department of Customs and Excise has adequate resources to provide the needed
refunds through providing for a revolving fund from which the Department can pay
the duty drawbacks.
25.   Limitations on the capacity of tax administration and an erosion of pay scales
due to inflation have led to a lowering of revenue collection rates in recent years.
Hence, improving administrative capacity should be part of an integrated strategy for
strengthening revenue collections over the next few years otherwise tax collections
will continue to deteriorate. The Government is currently reviewing proposals to
increase salaries and introduce performance based incentives within the existing tax
administration. As a further step, the Govemment has prepared the terms-of-reference
to carry out a study to examine the costs and benefits of creating a national revenue
authority with sufficient authority and resources to provide adequate incentives for its
staff. The Government has finalized and improved arrangements for pre-shipment
inspection of imports to strengthen the tax administration and revenue collection.



DEREGULATION
26.   AgicuWtume Policies: Agriculture is the source of 40% of GDP and 90% of the
export earnings of Malawi, and will remain the mainstay of growth for the foreseeable
future. Given that 85% of the population lives in the rural areas, the performance of
this sector directly affects the welfare of most Malawians, including the most
vulnerable people. In December 1994, the Government adopted a comprehensive
sectoral strategy, "The Agriculture and Livestock Development Strategy and Action
Plan" to help transform the agricultural sector from a subsistence/dualistic structure
(over-dependent on maize and tobacco) to a more diversified and viable one that also
functions as a catalyst for growth in the non-farm sector. The main objective of
Government's strategy is to attain broad-based sustainable agricultural growth of at
least 4.5% per annum in real terms by removing the most binding constraints (access
to land, cash crops, inputs, and markets) to the integration of smallholders into the
mainstream of development.
27.   Access to Land. Malawi urgently needs a thorough re-examination of rules
governing access and use of land, and comprehensive restructuring of public
institutions involved in land administration in order to improve security of tenure to
all categories of producers. Since independence, agricultural land-use policy for the
private sector has remained strongly divided between freehold or leasehold and
customary tenure, that is, between mostly export crop production by estates and
mostly subsistence farming by smallholders. The gap between rich and poor has
widened and subsistence farmers have been largely ignored. Privileges to grow burley
tobacco (allocated exclusively to estates through a license and quota) fueled wide-
spread reclassification of customary tenure to leasehold; the number of leasehold
estates soared from 1,200 in 1979, to 30,000 in 1994, and average size dropped from
250 ha to less than 20 ha. The distinction between small estates (with areas between
10 ha to 20 ha) and smallholders has become blurred. Many small estates have all the
characteristics of smallholder farms. Much of the conversion has taken place in an



uncoordinated way and many small "'raduated" estates are claimed by more than one
leaseholder. In addition, there is a large back log of unregistered lease applications.
28.   The Govemment is open to discussions and is prepared to take action on these
issues which were virtually taboo in the past. However, in view of Government's
limited administrative capacities in this area dialogue is still at an early stage. We
expect detailed principles of a new land policy to evolve within the next 18 months
after substantial analytical work will have been carried out.  Government has
announced the establishment of a Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Land Policy
in support of a participatory process (including, but not limited to, smallholders,
traditional authorities, local government authorities, estate owners) for the complete
review and reform of Malawi's land policies aiming at promotion of equitable access
to land. security of titles and, improved procedures for land administration. The
members of the Presidential Commission , its TOR and duration, will be gazetted
shortly.  The broad-based membership of the Presidential Commission and its
exclusive reporting responsibility to the President will ensure that the investigation is
carried out in a transparent manner at arms length from Government or any
Government agency or ministry.  As this review continues, the Government has
declared a country-wide moratorium on conversions of customary land to leasehold
tenure. This will allow a coherent review of existing leases to discover and revoke
defective leases, resolve lease disputes, catch up with registration of the backlog of
lease applications and establish efficient mechanisms for preventing harmful
encroachment and development along the lake shore. To immediately raise incentives
for more efficient use of existing estate land and facilitate the development of a more
active land market, Government has increased land rents, effective April 1996, from
MK35 per hectare to MK50 per hectare and improved efficiency of collection.
Significant areas under leasehold are idle and it is expected that higher opportunity
costs will create incentives for estate owners to sublease and subdivide land. In line
with this objective, Government amended the legal framework, the Land Act, to allow
for annual review of increases of land rents and three months notice before
effectiveness. Government has put in place a process to repossess estate land from



rent defaulters. In March 1996, a list of the 30 most severe cases of rent arrears for
each of 24 districts was submitted to the Minister of Lands and Valuation for approval
to register re-entry. We expect to start with actual repossessing of land by May 1996.
We will continue this exercise until all defaulters have been prosecuted. Over the
medium-term Government intends to classify estate land into three to four categories
according to soil fertility and yield potential and then introduce a differentiated land
rent structure. Government plans to develop an implementation plan to better enforce
the environmental covenants on estate land requiring 10% of estate land to be kept
under forest. As an added incentive Government is considering a discount on land
rents for those estates who comply with these environmental covenants.
29.   Access to Cash Crops. Over the past 4 years, important progress has been
made with regard to granting smallholders gradual access to profitable cash crop
production and marketing, including lifting the restriction of smallholder access to
burley tobacco and eliminating the monopsony power of ADMARC. Smallholder
access to burley tobacco production has (i) directly improved household income levels
for over 60,000 smallholder households; (ii) enabled diversification in other
agricultural and non-agricultural activities through forward and backward linkages; and
(iii) reduced household vulnerability to drought effects. The amount of burley quota
allocated to smallholders has gradually increased from 3 million kg in 1991/92 to 15
million kg in 1994/95. In 1995/96 the smallholder burley quota system was de facto
lifted and all smallholders in tobacco clubs who wanted to grow burley were
registered as growers. In addition alternative marketing outlets have been created for
smallholders through the intermediate buyers program. The repeal of the Agricultural
Crop and Livestock MIarketing Act has been approved and will be presented to
Parliament in March/April 1996. Relevant sections in the Special Crops Act that
excluded smallholders from growing high-value cash crops have been removed from
the Act. In addition the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development and
Ministry of Statutory Corporations are currently designing an action plan to privatize
those crop authorities that were formed under the Special Crops Act, convert them into
voluntary grower associations, and consider abrogation of the Act.



30.   The Government will eliminate the burlev tobacco quota system.  An
announcement of Government's policy made in January 1996 commits the Government
to formally replace the smallholder quota system with a registration system.
Specifically, for 1996/97 new and or existing production quota will be allocated to
meet all production registrations by smallholder tobacco clubs (who will have access
to auction floors). Individual smallholders will not be required to register and can sell
to intermediate buyers. For 1997/98 the existing production quota system will be
replaced by a production registration system.
31.   The proposed changes in burley tobacco production and marketing for 1996/97
and 1997/98 are quite monumental and will require a concerted effort on the part of
the tobacco industry to ensure a smooth transition. There are many logistical issues
that need to be considered as soon as possible.  A consultative group with
representatives from Govemment and the tobacco industry will be forned to deal
with these issues. Technical assistance miaht also be needed to plan this transition.
32.   It is expected that the number of burley-producing smallholder households will
increase to 200,000 -- 300,000 by the year 2000. Over the next two years this action
is expected to inject an additional US$60 million into the smallholder sector.
Nevertheless, the burley policy will not reach all smallholders, for instance many of
those with less than 0.5ha land and no cash to purchase inputs, and will need to be
augmented by other pro-poor policies and programs, for instance public works under
the forthcoming IDA supported Social Action Fund.
33.   Access to Inputs. A key part of Government's strategy to enhance agricultural
productivity and diversification is to increase the access of farmers to improved and
suitable technologies and inputs, such as fertilizers, farm feeds and seeds. Since
1994, private traders have been allowed to participate in the import and distribution
of smallholder inputs. However, cumbersome licensing and compulsory approval
procedures continued involving both the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock
Development and Ministry of Commerce and Industry in inhibiting smallholders'
access to fcrtilizer, agrochemicals and improved seeds. This kept transaction costs



high, discouraged private trader participation, and thus limited crop and Jivestock
options for smallholders.
34.   To accelerate agricultural diversification, Government has approved the
streamlining of licensing, registration, and reporting procedures for the importing,
selling and distribution of fertilizers, farm feeds and seeds. By requiring only a
general business licence issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and no
additional reporting to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, trade
in fertilizers, farm feeds and seeds have been liberalized. The Ministry of Agriculture
and Livestock Development will continue to monitor the labeling and composition of
fertilizers, farm feeds and seeds. In addition, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry
will help monitor and enforce standard business practices, including licensing and
reporting, associated with the importation, selling and distribution of fertilizers, farm
feeds and seeds. Technical assistance will be needed to evaluate our system of
monitoring and enforcement and suggest how to make them more effective as we
move towards greater market liberalization.
35.   Access to Markets. Important progress was made over the past 2 years with
the liberalization of virtually all agricultural producer prices and export controls. In
May 1995, the system of fixed producer and consumer prices was replaced by a price
band in which the actual price is determined by market conditions, and ADMARC has
been mandated to defend the gazetted floor and ceiling prices. In practice, this year,
ADMARC encountered numerous problems with implementing the maize price band,
including: (i) its conflicting role as defender of the band and commercial operator; (ii)
lack of liquidity at maize harvest and into the selling season; and (iii) reluctance to
operate a flexible price system  within the band.  As we strive toward market
liberalization and increased private sector participation, we feel that it is important to
protect vulnerable producers and consumers from the potential harm caused by
unstable maize prices. We believe that the price band is a sensible transitional phase
toward fully liberalized maize markets. In the meantime we need to widen the price
band and limit the amount of locations where it is defended, promote private sector



market activity within the band, and design appropriate roles for ADMARC and the
Strategic Grain Reserve (SGR). For example, we recently decided to establish a
separate SGR account as a means for funding maize purchases in the future. We have
also agreed to tender for maize purchases for the SGR and have a competitive bidding
process for future management of the SGR.
36.   The  ultimate  objective  is  to  move  toward  border  price  parity,
commercialization of all ADMARC's agricultural trading activities and establish an
independently managed SGR. The independently managed SGR would receive its
overall policy directive from the Government To carry out these changes efficiently
we have commissioned a series of studies and requested technical assistance (under
the Agricultural Sector Assistance Proaram and the IDA supported Agricultural
Services Project) to provide support on implementation issues of the maize price band.
It has been agreed that studies on "The Future of ADMARC" and "Expanding Private
Sector Participation in Maize Marketing" be carried out, and technical assistance on
"Implementation of the Mlaize Price Band", especially management of the SGR as a
price stabilization facility. In addition, Government will undertake a study to design
a comprehensive food security and drought management strategy to deal with a wide
range of food production and consumption issues.
37.   Access to Transport.  In addition to the high costs of external transport,
manufacturers and consumers alike suffer from inefficient and costly domestic road
transport.  Under the protective mantle of Government regulations and statutory
minimum freight tariffs, the domestic road transport industry has grown over the last
seven years from nearly nothing to almost 500 companies varying in size from one
truck to over 200 trucks. However, while the objective of developing a substantial
domestic trucking industry has been achieved, the objective of developing efficient
domestic road transport service has not; many operations are poorly managed and
inefficient.
38.   Government is committed to facilitating competitiveness and cost efficiency
in the transport sector so that smallholders can benefit from efficient road transport



for produce and inputs. As a first step, Government has removed regulations and
practices (including foreign exchange controls) that prohibited Malawian operators
from importing second hand vehicles and spare parts, thus lowering the cost of fleet
expansion and vehicle maintenance.  Furthermore, Government plans to revise the
Road Traffic Act. In this context, the Government has already removed the minimum
tariffs on domestic freight transport to help ensure higher levels of competition in the
sector. Recognizing that transport costs are a function of many factors, Govemment
will carry out a comprehensive evaluation of transport policies under the IDA
supported Railways Restructuring Project. Such a review would include a thorough
examination of transit pricing and user fees (including permits, tolls and fuel taxes);
road construction, maintenance and financing; and competition issues in transport
supply. The elimination of the minimum tariff and the other reforms expected from
the transport policy review should bring a direct benefit to the rural poor and facilitate
agricultural diversification as it cuts transport costs and increases profit margins.
39.   Private Sector Development Policies:   The Government supports the
development of a broad-based private sector.  An active investment promotion
campaign to attract investors is underway and a privatization campaign is gaining
momentum. To create a more favorable environment for investors, Government has
identified a number of measures to simplify the approvals required to launch new
investments. In 1993, institutional constraints identified bv MIPA, the private sector,
and a manufacturing sector survey carried out by IDA include: (i) discriminatory laws
and practices; (ii) lack of serviced and unserviced sites for potential investors; (iii)
slow approval and uncertain renewal of temporary employment permits (TEPs) for
expatriate workers; and (iv) inconsistent and uncertain application of existing
incentives. In addition the survey identified economic constraints and a lack of
foreign exchange and high interest costs.
40.   The  institutional constraints are  being  addressed, starting  with  the
Government's approval to repeal laws that discriminate against non-indigenous Malawi
citizens. Specifically, Government has approved the repeal of Part IIA of the



Businesses Licensing Act (the Bill will be presented to Parliament in March/April
1996), which limited citizens of Asian descent to doing business in prescribed
"business districts". In addition, the Govemment has made enormous progress on the
availability of industrial land. First, it has identified public lands in proximity to
existing industrial estates in Lilongwe and Blantyre to be zoned as unserviced
industrial plots and to be offered to private investors under long-term lease
arrangements. In Lilongwe, this includes two areas with close to 300 unserviced plots
in total. Some 110 serviced plots on privately owned freehold land are currently
available in Blantyre and Ministry of Lands and Valuation is developing some 200
new serviced plots. This should address the immediate shortage of industrial land, but
Government also intends to continue its efforts to streamline the process of supplying
land for industrial development. Third, action has been taken on the rationalization
of the TEP system, to eliminate the backlog and make it more transparent and
automatic. Government is committed to a target of processing all TEP renewals
within 30 days, with an absolute maximum processing time of 45 days.
41.   Privatization. Compared to many other developing countries the parastatal
sector in Malawi, comprising 12 major commercial parastatals and over 100 statutory
entities accounting for 20% of GDP, has been well managed and for the most part
profitable. However, large fiscal losses have been incurred by Malawi Railways, and
to a lesser extent by Air Malawi and Viphya Timber Plantations. Some privatization
of both ownership and management has taken place over the past few years.
Examples of this are the divestiture of some of ADMARC's investments, and of some
of MDC's portfolio, and, most recently, the restructuring and future privatization of
Malawi Railways which is supported by an IDA project.
42.   Government has embarked on a far-reaching privatization program to avoid a
large potential drain on the budget, increase the efficiency of scarce capital
investments, boost private sector development, and attract foreign investors.  In
October 1994, a Privatization Commission under the chairmanship of the First Vice-
President was put in charge of developing a comprehensive privatization program. A
Technical Committee prepared a draft Policy Framework for Privatization which has
been finalized after several rounds of consultations and discussions between



Government and the private sector. The Policy Framework was endorsed by Cabinet
and issued as a Policy Statement in December 1995. The appropriate legal framework
was agreed with IDA and approved by Government; the draft Bill has been forwarded
to Parliament for consideration in the March/April session 1996. The institutional set-
up for privatization has been finalized; a Privatization Transactions Unit located
outside the civil service will be in charge of the actual divestiture process. The
authorities have identified those State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) that will be offered
for privatization during the forthcoming 5 year period (including the portfolios of
ADMARC and MDC, Air Malawi, and Viphya Plantations). Further, subvented
parastatals that will be liquidated and purely developmental statutory corporations that
can be integrated into parent ministries have been identified. Government has already
carried out a preliminary study to collect key data such as financial performance,
employment, and legal status on selected SOEs. This study will be expanded into a
divestiture prospectus for the most important SOEs which would be offered for
privatization over the next 18 months.
CONCLUSION
43.   Since taking office in May 1994, the new Government of Malawi has initiated
and implemented far reaching macroeconomic and structural reforms with the aim to
attain sustainable growth and poverty reduction. We are strongly committed to
continue and accelerate this reformn process under the Fiscal Restructuring and
Deregulation Program. It is our intention to expedite the program and take whatever
other complementary measures necessary to ensure its success. The Govemment
views IDA support as an important input to this effort.
