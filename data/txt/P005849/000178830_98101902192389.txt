INTERNATIGNAL DEVELOPENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECCK4ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLEIS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOR A HIG3IAY ENGINEERING PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recoimendation on a proposed
development credit to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) for
the equivalent of US$560,ooo to finance the foreign exchange cost of a
project for detailed engineering and technical assistance in the highway
sector. In accordance with the normal procedure for credits of this type,
the credit would have a term of 10 years with 2 years of grace; it would
subsequently be refinanced by any loan or credit made by the Bank Group
to finance the highway project which the engineering credit would help prepare.
PART I -- THE ECCNOMY
2.        A report entitled "The Economy of Southern Yemen" (EMA-24a)
dated October 2, 1970 was distributed to the Executive Directors on
October 23, 1970. This was updated in the economic section of the
President's Report (P-910) dated March 1, 1971 on the First Highway
Project to PDRY. The next economic mission is scheduled for November 1972.
A Basic Data Sheet is attached as Annex II.
3.        The economy of FDRY up to independence in 1967 was centered
around Aden and was service-oriented, with entrepot trade, bunkering for
Suez Canal traffic and services rendered for the British military base
providing the mainstay of economic activity. The productive sectors
generated less than one-quarter of GDP. Except for the large Aden
refinery, there was little industrial activity and a considerable
amount of foodstuffs and manufactured goods was imported. The large
trade deficit was covered by remittances of Yemenis living abroad, and
British budgetary aid and military expenditures.
4.        The closure of the Suez Canal, withdrawal of British troops
from Aden and the discontinuation of British budget support in 1967/68
led to a major setback in the economy, with GNP falling by one-third and
foreign exchange earnings by three-fifths. Unemployment became a serious
problem especially in Aden where employment dropped by nearly one-half.
The newly formed socialist government followed extremely conservative
budgetary practices, rigorously cut public expenditures, drew on its
cash balances and turned to socialist countries for aid (mainly USSR,
People's Republic of China and Eastern Germany). Most foreign establish-
ments (mainly banks, shipping, trading and insurance companies, but not
the refinery) were nationalized in 1969. By 1970 there was also a sharp
decline in re-exports to the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) due partly to the



-2-
development of YAR's own trade, and partly to the introduction of import
duties by PDRY, in November 1970. The balance of payments deficit is
presently covered mostly by private remittances and bilateral aid.
5.        To lessen the country's dependence on the service sectors, the
Government is making an effort to diversify the economy. In view of the
extreme scarcity of known natural resources, this process will inevitably
be slow and difficult.  AgricultuLre, including the fisheries sub-sector,
is one of the few areas offering some development opportunities. Since
FDRY is a net importer of food, growth in this sector could save foreign
exchange for other development purposes. There is also scope for small-
scale industrial activity which would broaden the productive sector of
PDRY's economy and reduce unemployment in urban areas.
6.        The Three-Year Development Plan (1971-74) consequently seeks
to expand agricultural (including fisheries) production and to establish
light industries using local raw materials. The Plan also envisages the
construction and repair of roads to connect the governorates to Aden and
to link towns likely to become centers of production.  As domestic finan-
cial, managerial and technical resources are extremely limited, most of
the public investment is being financed by foreign assistance. In
agriculture, the Kuwait Fund is engaged in preparing a project to
increase production, especially of cotton, in the Abyan Delta. The USSR
has already financed minor irrigation works in the Wadi Tuban area where
a FAO technical assistance mission expects to identify an agricultural
project for financing after 1975. Consultants engaged by the Kuwait
Fund hope shortly to complete a socio-agro-economic survey of PDRY. In
the fisheries sub-sector, contracts have been signed with Japan for the
fishing of cuttlefish (on an annual royalty of US$1.5 million) and with
the USSR to exploit rock lobster. IDA is appraising a project to assist
the traditional fishing sector. Oil exploration is under way in collab-
oration with the Algerian company SCNATRACH, but as yet no exploitable
discoveries have been made.
7.        Present information on the external debt of PDRY is fragmentary
and in the form of incomplete global figures only. The PDRY has concluded
agreements for economic and technical cooperation with a number of countries
since 1968.  Lines of credit established under these agreements until the
end of 1971 exceeded YD 50 million (about US$130 million). Of these, about
YD 15 million (approximately US$ho million) were drawn. Bank staff visited
the country in February 1972 and assisted the Yemeni authorities in estab-
lishing an improved system for the collection and processing' of debt
information, which will be reviewed by the forthcoming economic. mission.
However, even in the absence of further detail on external debt, it is
evident that in view of the extremely limited resources of the country,
the severe constraints on the government budget and balance of payments
and the uncertainty of future export earnings, Bank Group assistance to
PDRY should be on IDA terms.



-3-
83.       Nationalization Law No. 37 of 1969 provides for the nationali-
zation of foreign owned enterprises and the vesting of their assets in the
Economic Organization for the Public Sector and National Planning. The
owners are to receive compensation in the form of 20-year government bonds
bearing interest at 2 percent. The law also provides that 25 percent of
the net annual profits of the Organization are to be used for "financing"
these bonds. A British firm of accountants of international reputation
was appointed in early 1970 to evaluate the assets of the enterprises
involved.  Their report was submitted in September 1971. Since then
discussions with certain major claimants have been taking place and have
included consideration of settlement terms different from those mentioned
above. These discussions are still in progress.
PART II -- BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PDRY
9.        PDRY became a member of the Bank in 1969 and of IDA in 1970.
Based on the findings of an economic mission in March 1970, the Bank
Group concluded that it could play an effective role in helping the
Government to redirect the economy away from the services sectors
towards the commodity producing sectors, particularly in agriculture
and fishing, together with road construction, designed to link produc-
tion centers to consumer and export facilities. Therefore, the Bank
Group's initial strategy has been directed towards project identification
and preparation in agriculture and transport and towards the development
of the infrastructure required for these purposes.
10.       The proposed highway engineering project would continue the type
of assistance begun under the First Highway Project (Credit No. 240 YDR)
made in April 1971. It would provide the additional funds needed to con-
tinue the detailed engineering of road construction projects and to provide
technical assistance for the reorganization of the Public Works Department
in order to complete preparation of a Second Highway Project for consider-
ation in FY 1974.
11.       Another project under consideration for IDA financing in FY 1973
is a $3 million fisheries project to assist the traditional fishing sector.
This project would also include a study of harbor facilities and fish
resources in the remote eastern part of the country and a study of
agricultural credit needs. A UNESCO/IBRD mission is presently
formulating an education project with special emphasis on vocational
education for possible IDA financing. Finally, the UNDP is financing
the preparation of a sewerage improvement project for Aden for which
the WHO is the Executing Agency and which might lead to Bank Group
lending.

PART III -- THE SECTOR AND THE PROJECT
The Sector
12.       Highways are the principal means of internal transport in PDRY.
Shipping is limited to the ports of Aden and Al Mukalla; the latter, however,
has only lighterage facilities ,so that communication by sea is often
disrupted during the monsoon season. The national airline, YAMDA,
provides a few international and all domestic services but, except for
the Aden airport, the other airports are badly equipped and can acommodate
only light aircraft. There is no railroad. Recent activities in the
sector have been concerned mainly with highways, which, according to
the inventory prepared by the highway technical assistance consultants
under the ongoing Highway Project include a network of about 4,700 km of
roads and tracks. Only about 330 km are asphalt paved and in fairly
good condition; they are mainly around Aden with some connecting links
to the Second and Third Governorates. A further 200 km are cobblestone
paved. The remainder are merely tracks negotiable by landrover or light
trucks but impassable during flash floods. Consequently, commmnication
between Aden and its hinterland is difficult and costly.
13.       The People's Republic of China (PRC), the UNDP and the World
Food Program (WFP) are providing assistance for improving and expanding
the highway network under the Three-Year Development Plan (1971-74). The
PRC is designing and constructing the 500 km road between Am Ayn and Al
Mukalla; 20 km have been constructed and about 250 km are scheduled to
be completed by 1974.  The UNDP is financing road equipment and experts
to complete construction of the 36 km road between Nobat Dukeim and Kersh.
When this road is completed, a paved road will link Aden and the Yemen
Arab Republic border. Under the WFP, about 2,500 km of roads and tracks
are scheduled to be rehabilitated, improved or constructed by 1977; 530 km
are scheduled to be completed by 1974. The total cost of this program is
estimated at US$11 million, of which $3 million will be food contribution
costs; the technical assistance consultants under the ongoing Highway
Project are assisting in planning this program.
History of the Project
14.       The proposed Highway Engineering Credit would provide assistance
similar to that under the First Highway Project (Credit No. 240 YDR), which
had the following components:
a. technical assistance to the Public Works Department (FWD)
for its reorganization, with special emphasis on road
maintenance and workshop operations;



- 5 -
b. feasibility studies of 305 km of roads, for which detailed
engineering had already been completed and a further 490 km
of high priority roads, for which detailed engineering has
not been completed;
c.  redesign and detailed engineering of about 240 km of roads
resulting from (b);
d. procurement of spare parts for existing highway maintenance
equipment, together with workshop and communications equip-
ment; and
e. overseas scholarships for training FWD local staff.
The 1971 IDA credit of US$1.i6 million finances the foreign exchange cost
of items (b), (c) and (d) and a UNDP grant of US$673,000 covers the
foreign exchange cost and about US$140,000 of the local cost of
items (a) and (e), with the balance of local cost coming from the
Government. The total project cost has been reexamined and is still
estimated at US$2.7 million.
15.       The project is proceeding satisfactorily and US$476,564 had
been disbursed by September 30, 1972. The consultants engaged for the
feasibility studies, Dar Al-Handasah (Lebanon), submitted their final
report on August 20, 1972, and the consultants engaged for the technical
assistance to PWD, VIAK-AB (Sweden), submitted their interim report on
March 31, 1972. The Government has agreed to implement VIAKts recomnenda-
tions to reorganize and improve the FWD, and also to undertake some addi-
tional and essential detailed engineering recommended by Dar Al-Handasah.
16.       The studies carried out by Dar Al-Handasah under the ongoing
Highway Project showed that the Al Mukalla-Saywun road (about 313 km),
and the As Said-Ataq (35 km) have highest economic priority of all roads
studied. Moreover, the economic analysis indicated that the whole length
of the Al Mukalla-Saywun road should be treated as a single project and
the Government agrees it should be constructed as a first priority. Addi-
tionally, a 37 km spur from this road at Ar Riyan to Ash Shihr port is
also of high priority for the fisheries project (para. 22) and should be
included for detailed engineering. As a result, the provision for
detailed engineering for 240 km included under the ongoing First Highway
Project needs to be increased by 145 km to 385 km.
The Project
17.       Since all funds for consultants' services under the First
Highway Project have been committed, the Government has asked the
Association to help finance the additional services now required.



-6-
This additional assistance would be eligible for UNDP financing, but
all UNDP funds available for PDRY over the next five years have already
been allocated for other important projects. A mission to discuss the
proposed Highway Engineering Project visited PDRY in September 1972.
Project composition and conditions were further discussed during the
Annual Meeting in Washington with Mr. Farag Ben Ghanem, Technical Director
General, Central Planning Commission. Subsequently, negotiations were
completed in October 1972 through an exchange of correspondence with the
Government.
18.       The project would consist of:
a. detailed engineering of about 110 km of roads comprised
of 73 km of the Al Mukalla-Saywun road and 37 khi of the
Ar Riyan-Ash Shihr road, and review and amendment of
existing detailed engineering for the 35 km As Said-
Ataq road; and
b.  technical assistance for 40 man-months to implement
improved administration and operations of the PWD.
Details of the project are shown in Annex III.
19.       The total estimated cost of the project is US$660,000 of which
US$350,000 will be for detailed engineering, US$250,000 for technical
assistance and US$60,000 for cdntingencies. The estimates are based on
costs of similar consulting services now underway in PDRY. The foreign
exchange component of 85 percent is based on the estimated cost of
salaries, international travel, and other foreign expenditures for the
foreign experts, and takes into account the lack of local staff.
Contingency allowances are in line with those normally provided for
these services. The proposed credit would finance the foreign
exchange requirement of US$560,000 and the Government would finance
the local expenditures. Disbursements will be on the basis of
100 percent of foreign exchange expenditures.
20.       Economic Evaluation.  The Al Mukalla-Saywun road would connect
the two major population centers in the Fifth Governorate. Using a very
conservative annual traffic growth rate of 5 percent, the consultants
have estimated that Average Daily Traffic (ADT) in 1994 would be above
100 vehicles. Benefits from the new road would be savings in vehicle
operating costs and the net value-added of increased agricultural
production in the Hadhramaut Valley area. Regarding the latter, the
Government intends to set up a Hadhramaut Valley Water Authority to
control and improve water usage in the area and to initiate a project
to increase agricultural production by improving farm husbandry and use
of fertilizers. Based on current estimates of road construction costs



- 7 -
and projected agricultural development, the economic return of construc-
ting this road would be about 13 percent; this will be verified when
the detailed engineering is completed and more accurate cost estimates
are available.
21.       When the As Said-Ataq road and the Am Ayn-As Said road (financed
by the People's Republic of China) are completed, a paved road will link
Aden and Ataq. Ataq, the capital of the Fourth Governorate, is an import-
ant trading and transshipping post for areas to its north, including YAR.
Benefits will be vehicle operating costs savings for normal and generated
traffic, and the economic return will be about 14 percent. Before independ-
ence, the consultants Dar Al-Handasah (Lebanon) prepared detailed engineering
for this road, but the design standards are too high for the projected traffic
and will be reviewed and amended under the proposed project.
22.       The Ar Riyan-Ash Shihr road will connect Ash Shihr, one of two
locations for a fisheries project recently appraised by an IDA mission,
to markets in several other governorates and the important market in the
Hadhramaut Valley. The mission's findings that this road is high priority
was confirmed by the feasibility study consultants under the ongoing First
Highway Project. Benefits will be vehicle operating costs savings for
normal and generated traffic. The economic return will be about 14 percent.
23.       Technical Assistance.  The increased activity in highway construc-
tion and rehabilitation underway and under preparation in PDRY has substan-
tially increased the requirement for highway administration and maintenance
services. The Public Works Department does not have the capacity nor the
expertise in highway planning, design and maintenance organization to meet
these new obligations. The technical assistance consultants (VIAK) have
therefore recommended additional assistance to support the FWD program of
reorganization, particularly in the design and maintenance sections. These
recommendations have been accepted by the Government.
24.       Consultants.  The consultants already employed for the ongoing
First Highway Project, Dar Al-Handasah and VIAK have carried out their
work efficiently. The proposed additional services would extend their
present work program. Since the employment of new consultants would
interrupt this work program, the Government has requested and the
Association has agreed that the same consultants be retained for the
engineering project.

PART IV -- LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
25.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Democratic Republic of Yemen and the Association, the Recommendation of
the Committee provided for in Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles
of Agreement of the Association, and the text of the resolution approving
the proposed credit, are bbing distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. The provisions of the draft Development Credit Agreement
follow the usual pattern of engineering credit agreements.
26.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART V -- RECCMMENDATION
27.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
development credit.
