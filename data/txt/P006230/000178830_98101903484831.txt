APPRAISAL OF THE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
CCMPANXIA BRASILEIRA DE ENERGIA ELETRICA (CBEE) 1/
SUMMARY
i.        Companhia Brasileira de alergia Eletrica (CBEE) has applied
to the Bank for a loan of US$6 2 millilon equivalent to help finance the
rehabilitation and expansion of its transmission and distribution system,
excludimng interest during construction  The project is estimated to cost
US$10 8 million equivalent
1i        The project consists of the rehabilitation and expansion of
the transmission and distribution system for the three-year period 1966-
68. 2/ Rehabilitation of the present system represents about 25 percent
of the total cost. The remaining costs are allocated to the construction
of about 40 km of 66 kv transmission lines, installation of a new 50
MVA, 138/66 kv substation, installation of eight 66/11.4 kv primary sub-
stations aggregating 60 MVA capacity, and expansion of the distribution
system.
III       CBEE is one of ten companies acquired from the American &
Foreign Power Company (AMFORP) in 1964 by Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras
(Eletrobras), an autonomous agency of the Brazilian Government   Eletro-
bras has retained the same management arrangements that were in effect
under AMFORP's ownership  COBE's operations are satisfactorily managed
and it should be capable of supervising construction of the project
Iv        The proceeds of the loan would be used to finance the cost of
equipment, materials and supplies procured under international competitive
bidding, and the foreign currency cost of engineering services. Awards
would be made after international competitive bidding with participation
by qualified domestic suppliers who would be granted a 15 percent pre-
ference. Satisfactory arrangements have been made for Eletrobras to
provide the balance of funds required to finance CBEE's program
v.        New Federal decrees issued late in 1964 allowed for the first
time the periodic revaluation of assets for tariff-making purposes
Tariffs were increased in 1965 and in June and November 1966 following
the revaluation of assets.  Arrangements have been made in connection
with the proposed loan to ensure that satisfactory tariffs will be obtained
in the future by CEEE.
VI        The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$6 2 million equiva-
lent for a term of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years

BRAZIL
APPRAISAL OF THE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
CCMPANHIA BRASILEIRA DE ENERGIA ELETRICA (CBEE)
I.   INTRODUCTION
* 1         Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S A  (Eletrobras) an autonomous
agency of the Federal Government, purchased ten electric utility companies
in Brazil from the American & Foreign Power Company (AMFORP) in November
196h   The systems were then in urgent need of rehabilitation and expan-
sion and a five-year program covering the period 1966-70 was prepared in
order to supply existing and prospective demand   In response to the re-
quest of Eletrobras the Bank has agreed to consider loans aggregating
the equivalent of approximately US$60 million to assist financing of the
expansion program over a period constituting three years of the five-year
expansion program   In accordance with the Bank's preference to lend
directly to the operating entity carrying out the project it is proposed
to make separate loans to four of the largest of the companies, located
in the south central region where Bank-financed power generation projects
are concentrated
2.        This appraisal report covers the proposed loan of the equivalent
of US$6 2 million to one of the four companies, Cia Brasileira de Energia
Eletrica (CBEE), which operates in the State of Rio de Janeiro   The
proposed loan would provide funds for about 57 percent of the estimated
cost of US$10.8 million equivalent of the expansion program of the com-
pany for the three-year period 1966-68 and would represent about 46 per-
cent of the estimated cost of the five-year program   About two-thirds
of the proposed loan would be expended on the distribution system and the
remainder on the high voltage system   Interest during construction would
not be included in the loan since the project consists predominantly of
distribution facilities which would become revenue bearing shortly after
installation. CEEE and the other three companies to which proposed loans
would be made have not been the recipients of previous loans from the
Bank.
* 3.        This report is based on the findings of the mission to Brazil
in November-December 1965, composed of Messrs D King and F Rydell of
the Bank. A long delay was experienced subsequently in negotiating
several issues with the Government of Brazil and the loan is only now
submitted to the Executive Directors for this reason   The long interval
which has elapsed has to some extent outdated the report, which is based
on the expansion program for the three-year period 1966-68. The complete
1/ This report is one of four essentially similar appraisal reports
covering proposed Bank loans to four distribution companies in Brazil.
The companies are under common ownership and as a result a consider-
able amount of the text is common to each report   Paragraphs and
Annexes which are identical or substantially similar have been identi-
fled with an asterisk (*) throughout the four reports, which are sub-
mitted as a group



- 2 -
recasting of the program at this stage would result in considerable further
delay in presenting the loan and to avoid thLs the appraisal is presented
substantially as prepared on the basis of the mission's original findings.
It is considered that this is justified by the circumstances
* 4         The project, as described hereafter, consists predominantly of
a distribution system expansion, the implementation of which is somewhat
flexible in that retardation of the program over a period can, up to a
point, be compensated by a subsequent acceleration. As noted in paragraph
29 a review must be made each year of the program proposed for the next
year as a condition of disbursement and proper application of the loan
funds will be assured in any event. The financial statements are outdated
for similar reasons but there has been no adverse change in the financial
condition of CBEE and the statements are therefore considered to be a fair
representation of the present and future financial position of the company.
II.   HOLDING COMPANY ORGANIZATION
* 5.        Centrals Eletricas Brazileiras S A  (Eletrobras), the owner of
CBEE, is an autonomous agency established by the Federal Government in
1961 to carry out studies and to finance, construct and operate electric
power works   It is a holding company which controls the operation of the
federal utilities.  It admministers public funds to expand the federal
power systems, assist with the expansion of other electric utilities in
need of financing, and finance power facilitLes in underdeveloped areas.
Eletrobras commenced operations in June 1962 and has become the most im-
portant single force in the development of the electric utility industry
Additional information concerning Eletrobras is given in Annex 1
* 6         On November 12, 1964 an agreement was concluded between Eletro-
bras and AMFORP whereby the Brazilian properties of the latter were ac-
quired by Eletrobras   In summary, for USW135 million Eletrobras purchased
from AMFORP the controlling stock and the short-term notes, amounting to
U $6b4 million, of the ten companies, becoming the majority shareholder of
each company. Payment is to be made over a period of 45 years
* 7         Prior to the acquisition of the companies by Eletrobras their
operating control in Brazil had been exercised by Companhia Auxiliar de
Empresas Eletricas Brasileiras (CAEEB), a management company established
in 1957 by A4FORP   Eletrobras, which acquired control of CABEB when it
purchased the companies, has retained this arrangement   CAEEB maintains
its headquarters in Rio de Janeiro where it employs a staff of 250   The
administration department supervises the operations of the associated
companies, provides procurement servlces for foreign purchases and sets
labor and wage policy   The engineering department supervises planning
and the capital budgets of the companies, prepares specifications, sets
technical standards and orients other phases of the operations from a
technical standpoint   The finance department supervises the accounting
activities of the companies, negotiates loans, makes rate studies and prepares
rate applications and supervises the operating budgets.



- 3 -
* 8        The organizational structure of CAEEB, instituted by AMFORP,
has remained intact. However, it is understaffed as a result of the
conditions described in paragraph 13. With the planned increase in staff
to meet normal requirements, the organization should be fully competent
to provide effective management supervision of the companies  It would
find it difficult, however, to coordinate and direct the proposed expan-
sion program in addition to supervising the operation of the companies,
and it therefore plans to make extensive use of the services of consultants
in this connection, as noted in paragraph 31.
III    THE BORROWER
9        CBEE supplies the City of Niteroi, with a population of 500,000,
and a second area 35 Im distant, which includes the City of Petropolis in
the State of Rio de Janeiro. In 1965 the demand was 90,000 kw and energy
sales were 373 million kwh. The company owns generating stations with an
aggregate capacity of 65 MW, of which 30 MW is 1ldroelectric  In 1965 it
purchased about 20 percent of its power requirements from Rio Light S A
It operates a 66 kv transmission system linking Petropolis, Niteroi and
the generating stations, as shown on the map.
10.      At present CBEE has approximately 800 km of primary distribution
circuit, 1150 km of secondary distribution circuit and 57 MVA of distri-
bution transformer capacity  Power is stepped down to the primary distri-
bution voltage of 11.4 kv at three substations in Niteroi and at two
substations in Petropolis and then distributed over a 127/220 volt second-
ary network. There are at present a few primary distribution feeders in
Petropolis operating at 2 3 kv which are to be converted to 11 4 kv  The
distribution systems are of the overhead type  Rural dlstribution is at
6.6 kv and 11.4 kv.
11       CBLE was established in 1909. Approximately 70 percent of the
common stock is owned by Eletrobras, with the remaining 30 percent held
by the public   It is administered by a five-man Board of Ihrectors elected
for a term of three years   The present Board took office in March 1965
and all of the members have had long service with the campany or CAEEB
including the President of CAEEB, who serves as a member. The company
is managed by an Eycecutive Di.rector, who is a member of the Board  Major
policies are set by CAEhB but the management of the company is respon-
sible for the day-to-day administration.
12       CBEE employs a total staff of 1,000 including 520 personnel in
the operating and Petropolis divisions, 220 in the accounting division,
30 in the purchasing division and 15 engineers  The CBEE organizational
structure, instituted by AMFORP, is satisfactory.
* 13       Prior to their acquisition by Eletrobras, the AMFORP companies
were in difficult financial straits due to the Government policy toward
investor-owned utilities. This resulted in the companies' inability to
obtain rate increases during the recent period of rapid inflation  The
maintenance and expansion programs of the companies were severely limited



- 4 -
by the shortage of funds. In addition, a considerable number of the
staff left their employ and there is now a shortage, particularly engi-
neerLng and supervisory, in the companies.   Wiring the next two years
CBEE plans to increase its staff by about a total of 200, including engi-
neers and technicians. In view of the scale of utility expansion in
Brazil, however, some dlfficulty may be experienced in obtaining a suf-
ficient number of engineers.
* 14.      In the past, major substation and transmission engineering was
carried out by CAEEB   Distribution planning was carried out by the CBEE
engineering staff according to standards established by CAEEB.  These
arrangements will continue although due to staff shortages it will be
necessary to employ consulting engineers to assist with much of the design
work during the expansion program (paragraph 31)   The policy of the
company is to employ contractors for construction work
* 15.      Due to lack of funds, expansion of the power system facilities
necessary to satisfactorily supply the increasing load has not been pos-
sible in recent years and the reserve capacity which normally would be
maintained in accordance with sound utility practice has been utilized
to meet the increasing load   When the reserve capacity was fully employed,
equipment was then overloaded in order to meet further growth   This has
resulted in unsatisfactory operating conditions including low voltage and
service interruptions
* 16       The shortage of funds also forced the company to limit main-
tenance. As the result of this and the abnormal operating conditions
the useful life of some distribution equipment, particularly transformers,
may have been shortened   Replacement of a considerable number of trans-
formers which have become overloaded or obsolete would be necessary as
part of the expansion program.
IV    THE POWER MARKET
17       Adequate records have been kept by CEEE concerning power sales
which in 1965 amounted to 373 million kwh, with a peak demand of 90 MW
Residential service accounted for 32 percent, commercial 11 percent,
industrial 36 percent and miscellaneous 21 percent, of total sales   The
rate of grovwth has been about 7 percent annually during the past 10 years.
18.      The City of Niteroi and the remainder of the service area of
CBEE are to a large extent residential and industrial suburbs of the
City of Rio de Janeiro and can be considered as part of the metropolitan
area. At the end of 1964 CEEE supplied about 130,000 customers with an
average annual consumption of 3,100 kwh per customer
19       The power market has been studied by the company's consultants,
Cia. Internacional de Engenharia e Construcoes (CIECO), a Brazllian a>-
fillate of the International Engineering Company of San Francisco   It
is estimated that by 1970 the number of customers would increase to
180,000 with an average annual consumption per customer of about 3,200



kwh, and total annual sales of 580 million kwh, representing an average
annual growth of about 8 percent. The forecast of demand appears
reasonable.
20.      The company purchases power from Rao Light S.A which in 1965
provided about 20 percent of the requirements. In 1967 the CBEE system
will be connected with the Furnas system at which time it will obtain
power from both Rao Light and Furnas. The proposed arrangements envisage
that Furnas would make available to Rio Light the power which the latter
supplies to CEEE, from a contractual standpoint, CBEE would then purchase
power only from Furnas, at a price of Cr$18.5 per kwh (8 mills), estimated
in accordance with Government regulatory provLsions. Under these arrange-
ments an adequate supply of energy appears assured to CEEE in the future.
Annex 2 tabulates the past record and forecast of generation, purchases
and sales for the periods 1961-65 and 1966-70 respectively
21.      Power system losses, expressed as a percentage of total genera-
tion plus purchased power, which can be attributed predominantly to
losses in the distribution system, have increased for several years re-
flecting overload of distribution facilities   The load forecast envisages
a gradual reduction of losses (Annex 2) as the expansion program proceeds.
Beginning in 1968, however, losses would be increased someTwfhat as the
result of the transmission of power purchased from Furnas (paragraph 20).
For the purpose of estimating expenses on a conservative basis, it has
been assumed that losses would still approximate 17 percent by 1970
However, as set forth im the consultants' report, it is expected that
substantially lower losses would be achieved by that time if the expan-
sion program is carried out as planned.
V.   THE PROJECT
22.      The project comprises the rehabilitation and expansion of the
transmission and distribution system during the three-year period 1966-
68   About 25 percent of the expendlture would be required to rehabilitate
the existing system and increase its capacity to satisfactorily supply
the present load   The remainder would provide for expansion of the
system cormnensurate wlth the increase in load forecast for the three-
year period. The high voltage portion would involve the construction of
about h0 km of 66 kv transmission lines the installation of a new 50
MVA, 138/66 kv substation and of eight 66/11 4 kv primary substations
aggregating 60 MVA capacity
23       At the primary distribution level of 11 6 kv the work would
comprise the installation of additional primary feeders, rebuilding of
some of the existing feeders and the conversion of the remaining small
numoer of 2 3 kv feeders to 11 6 kv operation   For the secondary net-
work operating at 127/220 volts, the program would provide for the supply
and connection of approximately 20,000 new customers, the installation
of additional distribution transfonner capacity and the reinforcement of
many network feeders to relieve overload on existing facilities   The
program would involve the installation of about 45,000 MVA of dlstribution
transformers, associated switchgear and ancillary equipment, including
tne installation of about 18,000 meters

PERCENT OF TOTAL            57%            43%
E 25       The proposed loan amount would be used to finance equipment,
materials and supplies procured under international competitive bidding,
including domestic suppliers, and the foreign currency cost of engineering
services   It would not be used to finance the cost of labor, of wood
and concrete supports, of a large amount of hardware and of such materials
as cement, which would not reasonably be obtained outside Brazil, and
which, therefore, would not be procured under international bidding
26.      Brazil produces most of the items of equipment and materials to
be financed by the proposed loan   It is difficult to assess the com-
petitive position of Brazilian industry and to estimate the proportion of
the Bank financed goods which might be purchased in Brazil   However,
from the information whicn is available 50 percent of the loan might be
used for local purchases
* 27       The cost estimates were prepared by CIECO and CBEE assisted by
an experienced Brazilian engineering firm. CIECO, with the assistance
of the International Engineering Company assigned prices on the basis of
information available concerning international pricing of the equipment
and materials   These same prices were used in computing the cost of the
programs of the other three companies to which it is proposed to make
loans, thus assuring uniformity. A contingency allowance of approximately
12 percent has been included for the Bank financed component of the pro-
ject   This is to provide for some increase in the cost of equipment and
materials which would be subject to increase as the result of changes,
particularly copper. In addition, it is intended to make allowance for
increases in costs whlch in some cases may result to the borrower from
the purchase of Brazilian goods under the 15 percent preference formula
described in paragraph 32.



- 7 -
E 28        The local currency cost estimate was prepared in US$ equivalent,
as is customary in Brazil, where the rate of inflation has been high, to
provide a reasonably firm basis for comparison with actual costs as they
are incurred   Increased local costs due to inflation are expected to be
offset by periodic tariff adjustments permitted by law
* 29        The total estimated cost was prepared by extending to all the
areas covered by this program the detailed cost estimates made for
typical installations and areas   In view of the method it would be neces-
sary for the company to make detailed studles of the system expansion and
prepare detailed cost estimates each year as the program progresses   It
has been agreed that these studies and estimates in respect of the program
for a particular year would be submitted in a form satisfactory to the
Bank as a condition of further disbursement in respect to goods purchased
during that year.
30        DIring the 1966-70 period the company expects to make additional
capital expenditures of about US$8 million equivalent to provide various
minor system improvements and addlitions, new buildings and purchase trans-
portation equipment, which could not properly be included in the proposed
Bank loan   The magnitude of this program reflects the fact that this
aspect of the operations of the company was neglected in recent years
because of lack of funds. The program is tentative and it is possible
that the detailed plannimng and review which would be made would reduce
the proportions. However, the estimated expenditure of US$8 million has
been included in the financial projections to be on the conservative side
VI    STATUS OF ENGINEERING AND CONSTRUCTION
t 31        As noted in paragraph 27, CIECO supervised the preparation of
the cost estimates and would generally supervise and coordinate the pro-
ject   Detailed planning, and design of the transmission and large sub-
station work would be undertaken by CIECO and CAEEB   Distribution plan-
ning and design would be undertaken by CHGM  and by a local experienced
Brazilian engineering firm   Supervision of construction would be provided
by CDEE   Virtually all construction, both transmission and distribution
will be carried out by experienced Brazilian construction firms   Assur-
ances have been received that CAEEB and CBEE would continue to employ
consulting engineering firms satisfactory to the Bank
VII    PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS
* 32        As noted previously, the equipment and materlals which would
be financed by the proposed Bank loan (paragraph 25) would be purchased
under international competitive bidding, including Brazilian suppliers
The method of comparing foreign and domestic bids, which follows that
agreed between the Government and Bank in connection with previous power
loans, is quoted in part as follows



- 8 -
"The Borrower intends to invite firms producming goods in Brazil to
participate in the international competitive bidding   In the case
of goods produced in Brazil the Borrower may award the order to the
lowest Brazilian bidder offering satisfactory terms and conditions,
provided that his offered price does not exceed the offered price
of the lowest acceptable foreign bidder by more than 15 percent
Comparison of bids wll1 be made without taking into account customs
or other similar duties. For firms in Brazil, the delivery price
will comprise the F 0 B plant cost plus freight, insurance and
other delivery costs to Niteroi   For non-Brazilian firms, the
delivery price will be based on the C I F landed cost, port of
entry, before customs duties, plus inland freight, insurance and
other delivery costs to Niteroi. For reasons of economy, orders
may be placed jointly on behalf of the Borrower and any of the
other three companies which are the recipient of Bank loans. In
such cases comparison of bids will take into account the fact that
part of the order will be delivered at Niteroi and the other part
or parts at the delivery place provided for each of the other com-
panies. As the 15 percent preference allowed firms in Brazil is in
lieu of customs duties, the 15 percent will be added to the C I F
landed cost (excluding customs duties) of the non-Brazilian goods,
before in2and freight, insurance and other costs   In the case of
bids composed of both cruzeiros and foreign currency the cruzeiro
portion thereof will be dealt with as a Brazilian bid and the
foreign exchange portion as a non-Brazilian bid.
"For comparison purposes all bids after evaluation will be converted
into cruzeiros at the Bid Comparison Rate of Exchange   The Bid
Comparlson Rate of Exchange is understood to be the dollar selling
rate of the Banco Central da Republica do Brasil plus the exchange
surtax (but not to exceed 30 percent), if any, prevailing at the
date on which bids are closed   It is further understood that the
Bank will, on its own initiative, or at the request of the Borrower
or Guarantor, reconsider and, if necessary, revise the Bid Com-
parison Rate of Exchange, whenever there should be a substantial
change in the Brazilian exchange system which would, in the judgment
of the Bank, render such rate unsuitable for bid comparison purposes.
"The Guarantor will take all such measures as shall be necessary in
order to facilitate the importation, free from all legal and admlnl-
strative limitations or restrictions, of goods purchased outside
Brazil in accordance with the provisions hereof and of the Loan
Agreement "
In the latter part of 1965 the Government eliminated the exchange surtax
and established a new Banco Central buying rate of Cr$2220 = U $l   At
the present time, therefore, local and foreign bids would be compared
as described in detail above using a bid comparlson rate of exchange of
approximately Cr$2220 = U $l and allowing a 15 percent preference for
local bidders.

*  33        CIECO would prepare specifLcations and evaluate bids and
would provide overall coordination of procurement services for both
foreign and locally purchased goods to assure that the timing and quan-
tities of goods purchased would be in accordance with construction pro-
gress   CAEEB would provide purchasing services for the procurement of
goods obtained with Bank funds   CBEE would be responsible for procure-
ment of local goods
*  34.       Under this arrangement CBEE's Bank financed goods would be
grouped with those of the other three companies which are the recipients
of proposed Bank loans, so that in most instances a single order would
be placed to obtain the price advantage of larger orders   However, in-
voicing and delivery would be made directly to the respective companies
in accordance with the allotments specified.

VIII   FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Tariffs
* 35        The regulations governing power operations and tariffs are con-
tained in the Water Code of 1934 and subsequent amendments and decrees,
including in particular a decree dated February 26, 1957, and three
decrees dated November 4, 1964   Prior to 1964, tariffs were based on the
use of historic values of investment and became increasingly unrealistic
as inflation developed, causing many utilities to incur operating losses
for several consecative years   The 1964 decrees reflected a major change
in Government policies by allowing utilities to revalue their investment,
and thus making it possible for utilities to apply for tariffs which would
yield adequate returns
* 36        Under the existing regulations, tariffs are reviewed and approved
by tne Waters Division every three years or at shorter intervals, at the
initiative of the Waters Division or the utility   Utilities are permitted
to apply for tariffs which would yield revenues covering (a) operating costs,
(b) straight-line depreciation of gross fixed assets in operation, exclud-
ing land and land rights, at annual rates of up to 8 percent for thermal
plants and up to 5 percent for all other facilities including hydro plants,
but with no minimum in either case, (c) a reversion provision of up to 3
percent, or an amortization provision of up to 5 percent, on the total
gross fixed assets in operation, also without minima, and (d) a return of
10 percent on the remurerable investment   Remunerable investment is
defined as gross plant in service (excluding assets acquired through con-
tributions in aid of construction) less depreciation and reversion or
amortization reserves, plus reversion or amortization funds and an allowance
for working capital consisting of operating inventories, the equivalent of
two months billing, and cash (up to the value of the reserve for depreciation
balance) excluding cash representing contributions in aid of construction
Shortfalls in achieving the return of 10 percent in the three-year tariff
period may be recovered, in principle, in the subsequent three-year period
Another provision in the regulations, however, permits tariff adjustments
for recovering shortfalls to be made at more frequent intervals
* 37        Between tariff revisions, the following surcharges may be added
by the utilities on their current tariffs without permission of the Waters
Division   (a) monthly, for compulsory increases in wages, social benefits,
cost of fuel and purchased power  and (b) semi-annually, for increases in
foreign debt service due to changes in the foreign exchange rate
* 38        Tariff adjustments for the revaluation of the balance sheets
accounts can be made as often as economic correction factors (coefficients),
showing the variations in the purchasing power of the currency, are pub-
lished by the Nattional Economic Council   The coefficients are issued
annually about two months after the end of each year for the use of industry
in general   They are applied by utilities to up-date the values of plant
in service, depreciation and amortization or reversion reserves, and certain

local currency loans from the National Development Bank and/or Eletrobras
Foreign currency components of the book value of fixed assets are converted
into local currency at the rate of exchange in effect at the time the assets
are acquired   Foreign debts are revalued on the basis of the current rate
of exchange   The amount by which the revaluation of fixed assets exceeds
the revaluation of reserves and loans is set aside as a revaluation reserve
which is subJect to a 5 percent tax
* 39        In addition to the tariffs, two surcharges are being levied on the
consumer's electric bill by the Federal Government to help finance power
expansion in the country   In the case of the distribution companies
reviewed in connection with appraisals for Bank loans, the combination of
these surcharges have amounted to between 40 percent and 50 percent of the
average tariff in 1965   The proceeds of one of these surcharges, the "sole"
tax which was created in 1954, are allocated among the Federal, State and
Municipal authorities   This tax, the rate of which varies according to classes
of consumers, is presently based on an average price per kwh computed peri-
odically by the National Council of Water and Electric Energy   Another
surcharge, similarly computed and assessed, is the "compulsory loan", intro-
duced in November 1962 and which is to terminate in 1968    The proceeds go
to Eletrobras which in turn invests such funds in various power projects in
the form of loans or share capital   Eletrobras issues to the consumers, for
the amount of the "compulsory loans" paid, debt certificates carrying an
interest rate of 12 percent and redeemable in 10 years   A third surcharge,
which is a social security tax, is 8 percent of the tariff
4o        The implementation of the revaluation provision was not entirely
satisfactory during the initial year, 1965, due not only to the understand-
able complexities involved with the transition, but also to the permissive
character of several important provisions of the new regulations    Revalu-
ation was not then compulsory, the legislation provided for maximum rates of
depreciation and amortization but no minimum rates were prescribed and
recovery of shortfalls in earnings at intervals and for periods snorter than
three years was only optional   In addition, there was uncertainty among
utilities in regard to interpretation of certain provisions of the regula-
tions and long delays were experienced in a number of instances before
tariffs were actaally adjusted to reflect revaluation of assets
* 41.       The Bank was particularly concerned with two possLble consequences
of the permissive character of the regulations   Different tariff policies
could be followed which in the case of interconnected utilities, might well
lead to conflicting principles oeing used in calculating the apparent cost
of important blocks of power and could result in LmPortant economic decisions
being based on erroneous assumptions   While efforts were being made by
Government to implement sound and, in certain instances, relatively high
tariffs, there existed the possibility that, in compliance with the same
regulations, utilities might be allowed to revert in the future to inadequate
tariff levels
* 42        These questions were brought to the attention of the Government
early in 1966   It was suggested that regulations should be tightened to
ensure that a minimum and uniform level of tariff performance be required



- 12 -
from all utilities in the future. The Government indicated that it was
aware of this problem and was planning to continue improving the implementa-
tion of the regulations. It was not prepared at the time to propose correct-
ing legislation to Congress. Pending such legislation, however, it was
suggested that the Bank should define in a more detailed and specific rate
covenant than those in the agreements for earlier power loans, the minimum
level of financial performance it expected utllities to achieve, and that
the Government would support extension of this type of rate covenant to as
many other utilities as possible, through Eletrobras.
* 43.       During the negotiations for the four Distribution Loans, however,
the representatives of the Brazilian Government objected that the detailed
covenants proposed might conflict with Brazilian law. Pending clarification
of this point, negotiations were suspended. Conversations continued and
the Government informed the Bank recently that legislation had been enacted
by Congress which will. (1) make the revaluation of utilities' assets com-
pulsory, a measure which alleviates much of the Bank's concern, (2) reduce
by one half the level of electrification taxes and (3) extend the surcharge
on compulsory loans to 1973, provide for their annual revaluation, interest
at 6 percent and a 20 year term.
* 44.       Negotiations between the Government and the Bank over the question
of tariffs finally resulted in the following:
(1) The Government, CBEE and the other Distribut:on Companies agreed
to a covenant under which (a) as provided by the Brazilian legis-
lation, tariffs will be set so as to produce revenues at a level
consistent with sound financial and public utility practices,
using straight-line depreciation which shall be not less than that
based on the useful lives of depreciable assets in operation, and
(b) as permitted by the Brazilian legislation, assets wlll be re-
valued and tariffs will be correspondingly adjusted at least once
every calendar year.
(2) A change in legislation which shall adversely affect the settlng
of tariffs at the level stated above, shall be an event of default.
(3)  In a letter to CEEE and the other Distribution Companies the Bank
will defimne the standard which it would use to analyse a change in
legislation for the purpose of (2) above. This standard shall be
whether revenues from the sale of electricity are sufficient to
(a) cover all of the Borrower's operating expenses, including
straight-line depreciation of gross revalued fLxed assets in opera-
tion, at rates based on the useful lives of assets and (b) produce
a reasonable annual rate of return on the revalued average net
fixed assets in operation (which under presently foreseeable con-
ditions would be of the order of 10%).
* 45.       In the course of 1966, the assets of CEEE have been revalued
twice, to reflect the official cost indices at December 31, 1964 and 1965.
Corresponding tariff adjustments were made in June and November. The tariffs



- 13 -
introduced in June were calculated to provide inter alia for depreciation
charges at 5 percent, reversion charges at 3 percent and a 10 percent return
on the remunerable investment   Details of the Niovember adjustment are not
yet available
Financial Position
* 46        CBEE's financial statements for 1965 were audited by Boucinhas &
Compos, Certified Public Accountants   The accounting methods followed and
the auditing arrangements are satisfactory   In connection with the proposed
loan, CBEE should agree to continue to employ auditors satisfactory to the
Bank and to submit certified annual financial statements with the auditor's
report
* 47        The estimated financial position of CBEE as of December 31, 1965
is presented in the following statement and in Annex 6   Two balance sheets
have been shown in the followiing statement to indicate the effect of the
revaluation which will be recorded in 1966   The first balance sheet reflects
the value of the assets, capital and liabilities based on the revaluation
made in April 1965, which applied the 1964 coefficient    The second balance
sheet shows the result of revaluation based on the 1965 coefficient of 1 27

48        CBEE's revaluation of April 1965, increased net plant in service
by about Cr$19,000 million    The estimated revaluation that will be recorded
in 1966, based on the 1965 coefficient, will increase the net plant in
operation by about C,^t12,000 million to a total value of Crl&57,889 million
at December 31, 1965
49        Estimated share capital outstanding at December 31, 1965 is
Cr^'18,865 million  After CBEE revalues its accounts based on the 1965 co-
efficient, the revaluation reserve will be increased to Cr%'14,967 million
In accoidance with current regulations this reserve must be disposed of by
an equivalent stock distribution    Thus in 1966 the share capital will be
increased from Cr'S18,865 million to about Cr$33,800 million witnout taking
into account new equity investments
50        The first Export/Import Bank loan amounting to USt3 1 million was
made in 1953 to finance two 5 MIT steam stations in the Niteroi/Sao Goncalo
area and expansion of the transmission and distribution systems    This loan
was signed in 1953, carries a 4½ percent interest rate, and is being amoi-
tized over a 25 year period    The second Li-port/Import Bank loan amounting
to USP3 2 million wyas nade in 1959 to finance a 22 MT steam-electric
generating unit at the Sao Goncalo steam plant and a further expansion of
the transmission and distribution systems    This second loan was signed in
1959, carries a 5½2 percent interest rate, and is oeing amortized over a 20
year period   CBEE revalued these loans in accordance with the rates of ex-
change prevailing in 1963 and 1964    In April 1965, they were again revalued
based on the rate of exchange of Cr31,850 to US$1 and this value is reflected
in the first balance sheet above    In November 1965, the rate of exchange
was increased to Cr042,220 to US$1 at *rhich rate the value of the Export/
Import Bank loans outstanding at December 31, 1965 are shown in the second
statement above   The Export/Imnort Bank loans were originally made to CBEE
and the guarantor was the Brazilian Electric Powter Company (BEPCO), a wholly
owned subsidiary of AMFORP    On March 18, 1965, an agreement was executed
between the -xport/ImDort Bank and the Brazilian Government, whereby new
notes were exc±ianged for the notes issued under the original loan agreement
and the guarantor was changed from BEPCO to the Brazilian Government
51        At the time of the sale of the AflFORP companies to the Brazilian
Government, Eletrobras not only acquired the capital stock of the companies
but also about US$64 million in debts owed by the companies to A21FORP
These debts were reDresented by 8 percent demand notes but the companies
always considered such notes as long-term indebtedness    The purchase and
sale agreement specified that service on these notes would be paid to
Lletrobras, which in turn rould use the proceeds for payments on the purchase
price to AIIFORP  The Companies therefore wLll revalue these notes periodi-
cally in accordance with the prevailing foreln exchange rate    At the time
of the Bank's appralsal mission in November 1965, no definite arrangements
had been made for the operating companies to repay these notes to rletrobras
Fixed terms have now been estaDlished for these notes as follows (1)
interest rate 13 percent, (2) amortization payments to commence in 1968
(rletrobras' amortization payments to AMFORP also commence in 1968), and,
(3) amortization period of 25 years    These terms were used in connection
with the financial projections in this report



- 16 -
52        The other loans from Eletrobras, amounting to Cr$2,822 million,
represent funds advanced to cover capital expendltures and working capital
requirements since the date of acquisition of CBEE by Eletrobras    For
purposes of this report it has been assumed that these funds will carry the
same terms as those mentioned in the preceding paragraph except that amorti-
zation payments will start in 1970
Past Earnings Record
53        Income Statements for the years 1961 through 1964 are shown in
Annex 4   Until early in 1965 CBEE's tarLffs were based on historic costs of
its remunerable investment   Although tariff increases were made in the
past, increasing the average revenue per kwh from Cr$3 08 in 1961 to Cr$20 02
in 1964, they did not keep pace with the rapid inflation   During the period
from 1961 through 1964 operating results were exceptionally poor, with
operating losses occurring in three of the four years, culmunatzng wLth an
operating loss of Cr$769 million in 1964
54        Operations were substantially improved in 1965   Increased tariffs
based on the revaluation applying the 1963 coefficient increased the average
revenue per kwh from Cr$20 02 in 1964 to Cr$40 39 in 1965   Operating income
is estimated at about Cr$3 0 billion after deducting cbarges for depreci-
ation, reversion and exchange losses   Excluding income and revaluation
taxes this would represent a 8 0 percent rate of return on the net fixed
assets in operation at the end of the year, assuming the assets had been valued
on the basis of the 1964 coefficient   However, if the assets had been valued
in accordance with the 1965 coefficient, if depreciation had been recorded at
4 percent and if no charges had been made for reversion and exchange losses,
the rate of return would have been only 4 1 percent   Tnis low rate of return
reflects the facts that tariffs were computed on 1963 values and that they had
not become effective until about mid-1965
Proposed Financing Plan
55        A forecast of sources and applications of funds for the period
1966-1970 is shown in Annex 5 and summarized in the table below    During
the first three years of this period, CBEE would carry out the IBRD trans-
mission and distribution project as described in paragraphs 22 and 23,
which is estimated to cost Cr$23,980 million excluding interest during con-
struction   After the completion of the Bank's project CBEE intends to carry
out a continuous expansion program to meet the estimated annual increase in
demand for power   The forecast for this program for 1969 and 1970 indicates
a cost of Cr$6,000 million for the two-year period   Capital expenditures
in addition to the programs described above and totalling about Cr$'8,400
million, (see paragraph 30) are expected to be incurred throughout the
1966-1970 period
56        CBEE's fund requirements for the five-year period are expected to
total Cr$55,1453 million  Capital expenditure requirements would total
Cr$48,911 million, including Cry"531 million for interest during construction



- 17 -
About Cr$6,500 million would be required for additional working capital
based on the assumption that CBEE would attain a current ratio of 1 to 1
in 1968 and maintain it thereafter

ments
59        Under the present financial plan, share capital will be issued
during the period 1966 through 1970 for a total amount of at least equal to
that of the proposed Bank loan of Cr$13,760 million (US$6 2 million) plus
whatever additional amounts are required in order to meet the proposed divi-
dend schedule (see paragraph 66)    The Cruzeiro amount of the share capital
contributions would be increased to match any increase in the Cruzeiro
amount of the Bank loan due to devaluation of the currency     During negoti-
ations Eletrobras agreed that it will subscribe to the new shares in
relation to its holdlngs (at present 75 percent), and will also purchase
all new shares not taken up by the minority shareholders     The financial
plan indicates a total of about Cr$22 3 billion will be required as new
share capital, or about 40 percent of the total fund requirements
60        The proposed Bank loan of US$6 2 million is assumed to have a term
of 20 years, including a 5 year grace period with an interest rate of 6
percent   Interest during construction has not been included in the loan
61        Other resources amounting to about Cr$2,200 million, consisting
primarily of contributions in aid of construction, represents about 4 per-
cent of the total requirements
62        Under the proposed financial plan, it is estimated that by the
end of 1970, the total available funds would exceed fund requirements by
about Cr$350 million or 0 6 percent. During negotiatiors it was agreed that
in the event of a shortage of funds cash dividends would not be paid, and
furthermore, that Eletrobras would contribute all additional funds necessary
for completing the 1966-1970 expansion program
Estimated Future Earnings
63        The financial forecast for the five-year period, 1966 through
1970, is based on the assumption that the Borrower achieves the required
earnings as specified in the tariff covenant included in the proposed Loan
and Guarantee Agreements, i.e , a 10 percent return on the revalued average
net fixed assets in operation (see paragraph 43)     Foreign exchange expendi-
tures and sources of funds have been cast in terms of the official exchange
rate as of December 31, 1965, of Cr$2,220 to US$1    As far as local currency
is concerned, normal increases in operating costs due to expanded operations
have been considered but no provision has been made for the loss of value
of the Cruzeiro after 1965 as most of the effects will have been provided
for under the tariff arrangements and adjustments for inflation mentioned
in Daragraph 37   Depreciation has been computed at a 4 percent rate and no
charges have been shown for reversion. Kwh sales have been projected in
accordance with the load forecast as shown in paragraph 19 and Annex 2
64        The projections show that operating revenues would increase from
about Cr$15,100 million in 1965 to about Cr$32,200 million in 1970, or an



- 20 -
increase of about 113 percent    Operating income is expected to increase
from about Cr$3,000 million in 1965 to about Cr$7,800 in 1970    Because of
revaluations based on the 1964 and 1965 coefficients it is expected that the
average price per kwh would increase from Cr$40 39 in 1965 to Cr$52 00 in
1966   The average rate per kwh would decrease slightly in 1967 but during
the next three years through 1970 moderate annual increases in rates would
be required in order to attain a minimum 10 percent return on the average
net fixed assets in operation
65        Operating income would cover interest charges, including capital-
ized interest, 2 0 times in 1966 and this coverage would increase annually
reachling 2 6 times in 1970  Annual debt service would be covered by internal
cash generation 2 3 times in 1966 and increase to 2 8 times in 1970 as shown
in the Source and Application of Funds Statements, Annex 5    These ample
coverages reflect the large proportion of equity funds in the proposed
financial plan   Since the proposed Bank loan has a five-year grace period,
the first semi-annual amortization payment Ls not due until Pugust 1971, and
the first full year's debt service will not occur until 1972    It is esti-
mated, however, that interest coverage would be 2 9 times and 3 2 times in
1971 and 1972 respectively     Debt service coverage is expected to be 2 9
times and 3 0 times in 1971 and 1972 respectively
* 66        On the basis of the proposed tariff increases and estimated load
growth, all the former AMFORP companies expect to realize substantial oper-
ating proftts and should be in a position to resume payment of dividends
Eletrobras and CAEEB have therefore proposed a schedule of dividend payments
for the future   The proposal includes dividend payments starting in 1966
in accordance with the following schedule
Proposed Schedule of Dividends
Year             Dividend Rate
1966                   3%
1967                   6%
1968                   8%
1969                  10%
1970                  10%
67        Based on the forecast of operating results as shown in Annex 4
and the availability of funds as shown in Annex 5, CBEE will be able to de-
clare annual cash dividends correspondlng to the rates proposed in the
above schedule
Future Financial Position
68        Annex 6 shows forecast balance >-eets as of December 31, 1965
through 1970   During the period under review, CBEE s net fixed assets in
operation are expected to increase from Cr$57,889 million to Cr$87,112 mil-
lion, or by about 50 percent    Its fully revalued long-term debt of about
CrS24,700 million at December 31, 1965 is expected to reach its maximum
level of about Cr$34,400 million by 1969 and decrease to about Cr$33,100
million in 1970



- 21 -
* 69.       In order to maintain a satisfactory financial position throughout
the future it was agreed during negotiation to include a debt limitation
covenant in the Loan documents   This covenant requires that CBEE's long-
term debt outstanding at the end of any given year be limited to a maximum
of two-thirds of the total fixed assets   Such debt includes actual debt
drawdowns rather than the amount of the loan contracts, the current 12-month
portion of such debt carried in the books as current liabilities and any
short-term loans not incurred in the ordinary course of business
70        Annex 6 shows that CBEE could keep well within this limitation as
the percentage of its fully revalued long-term debt to net revalued fixed
assets including work in progress is about 40 percent in 1966, increasing to
41 percent in 1967 and 1968 and decreasing to 37 percent in 1970   This
assumes that CBEE will continue to revalue its investment to reflect the
true value of both its fixed assets and long-term loans
IX   CONCLUSIONS
* 71        The project, consisting of transmission and distribution expansion,
is technically and economically sound
* 72        The arrangements for engineering, procurement, and construction
are satisfactory   CBEE is capable of carrying out the project with the
assistance of CAEEB and the consultants, and of operating the facilities
thereafter
* 73        Funds necessary to complete the project, in addition to those made
available by the proposed Bank loan, are to be provided by Eletrobras
* 74        Under the Brazilian tariff regulations which permit pouTer compa-
nies to earn a 10% return on revalued assets, CBEE should be able to achieve
and maintain a strong financial condition
75        The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$6 2 million
equivalent for a term of 20 years, including a 5 year grace period

ANNEX 1
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS BRASILEIRAS S A (ELETROBRAS)
* 1         Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S A   (Eletrobras) was formed
in 1961 by the Federal Government pursuant to legislation enacted by
Congress that year and commenced operations in June 1962 following
approval of its By-Laws by Government decree    It is administered by a
President and Board of Directors, appointed for a term of three years
by the Government
* 2         it is empowered to carry out power development studies, to
finance, construct and operate electric pover generating plants and
transmission lines and directly or through subsidiaries to take such
actions as are necessary to initiate the supply of electric power in
the event of actual or prospective shortages
x 3         Eletrobras has developed along lines leading to two main
functions   It is the holding company owning the major interest in
electric power utilities of the Federal Government    These include the
former AMFORP companies, FURNAS (Central Eletrica de Furnas S A )
and CHESF (Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco)    It also ad-
ministers public funds for the expansion of federal power systems, for
the expansion of non-federal utilities in appropriate cases and to
initiate power development programs in underdeveloped areas of the
country
* 4         Eletrobras obtains funds from several sources, the most impor-
tant of which are the Sole Tax and the Compulsory Loan levied on electric-
ity consumer accounts   The former is a direct tax and the rates per
kwh consumed are fixed percentages of the 'fiscal rate" which is an aver-
age overall rate per kwh sold throughout the entire country    Since August
1966 the percentages are 5 percent for rural consumers, 17`2 percent for
residential and industrial consumers and 20 percent for all other con-
sumers
* 5         Commencing in July 1965 electricity consumers were required to
purchase obligations of Eletrobras in amounts equal to the Sole Tax
Since August 1966 the terms of such obligations are 6 percent interest
and a 20 year maturity   These obligations will also be revalued each
year based on the annual coefficients published by the National Economic
Council and interest and redemption payments will be made on such values
* 6         Eletrobras receives 40 percent of the proceeds of the Sole Tax
and the entire proceeds of the Compulsory Loan    Other sources of revenue
include the receipts from a percentage of federal excise tax collections
and custom assessments, interest on earnings, the proceeds of bond
issues and Government allocations
* 7         Eletrobras finances power projects by subscribing to capltal
shares and through the medium of long-term debt and short-term loans
The funds available for investment in 1965 were estimated at Cr$144,000
million (US$65 million)    In view of the ad valorem nature of the Sole
Tax and Compulsory Loan, the funds available should increase each year
as the result of increasing sales and higher tariffs
