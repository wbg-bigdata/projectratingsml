THIRD MEDIUM AND SMALL-SIZE CITIES
WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOAN 1726-CO)
PREAGE
1.    This Project Completion Report (PCR) deals with the Third Medium and Small-
Size Water Supply and Sewerage Project, for which Loan 1726-Ca in the amount of
US$31 million was approved on June 12, 1979. The Loan was closed on June 30,
1986, three years behind schedule. The loan became fully disbursed on June 18,
1987.   About US$0.5 million was cancelled in November 19s.J.  About US$29.3
million of the Loan funds were on-lent by Lnstituto Nacional de Fomento Municipal
(INSFOPAL) to twenty one beneficiariee.  The remaining US,'.2 million financed
a technical assistance program.
2.   Parts I and III of the PCR were prepared by the Infrastructure and Energy
Division, Country Department III, of Latin America and the Caribbean Regional
Office and are based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan and
Guarantee Agreements; supervision reports; final report prepared by INSFOPAL;
correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memorajida.
Part II of the report reproduces the chapter of conclusion,: c;f the final report
prepared by INSFOPAL.  This PCR is overtiiie by fcur years.   As the PCR is overdue
by four years, Parts I and II were not sent to the cofinanciers and the Borrower
for comments.

COLOMBIA
ThIRD MEDIUM AND SHALL-SIZE CITIES
WATER SUPDLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
(LOMA  1726-CO)
Proiect ObJectives
1.    The main objectives  of the Project were to continue  strengthening
INSFOPAL's operational capabilities; to contribute to the development of
financially viable companies in the cities to be benefitted by the Project; to
expand the water and sewerage facilities in 23 medium and small-size cities in
order to provide potable water and sewerage service for approximately 472,000 and
654,000 additional inhabitants, respectively; and to reduce unaccounted-for water
to not more than 25% by 1986.
Implementation Experience
2.    The Loan was approved by the Board on June 12, 1979, signed on November 30,
1979 and de.clared effective on February 28, 1980.  Thereafter, a naior delay
occurred in declaring the beneficiaries eligible for disbursement, which on
average took place more than three years after Loan signature. This was mainly
due the slowness in the implementation of tariff increases and in the preparation
of adequate financial projections needed to determine the tariff adjustments and
the financial monitoring indicators to be 'ncluded in the subsidiary loan
agreements.
3.    The Project was scheduled for completion by December i983, but most of the
works were completed by June 1987 or three and a half years later than scheduled.
The technical assistance component of the Project was only partially completed.
The reasons for not completing/delaying the completion of the Project, in
addition to the ones mentioned above, were: INSFOPAL and sub-borrowers'
management weakness; slow procurement processing; minor changes made in the scope
of the Project; and Government delay in providing the counterpart funds for the
Project and in approving tariff increases for the sub-borrowers.
Project Results
4.    In gener&l, the Project fell far short of meeting its objectives because,
even though the beneficiaries completed most of the investments originally
planned, the kroject was implemented with considerable delay, which contributed
to the service levels that were somewhat lower than the target established for
1986. INSFOPAL did not improve its managerial and operational capabilities and
was liquidated by the Government in January 1987. The beneficiaries did not
improve their financial, operational and planning capability to the level
expected at appraisal. Although data are unreliable, it is apparent that the
levels of water losses of the majority of beneficiaries were substantially higher
than the 25% targeted for 1986.  Tariff studies were not based on long-run
marginal costs as envisaged at appraisal; and the training program was not
implemented (paras. 15-19).
5.    It has to be pointed out that the data furnished by INSFOPAL and the
beneficiariea regarding the Project (cost, financial statement, and monitoring



- iii -
indica'o-s)  showed errors and inconsisterncies.   Therefore the information
prese:    in Part III shows the best estimate obtained by the staff who prepared
this rport.  Nonetheless, the main conclusions of the report will not change.
Proiect Sustainability
6.    It is doubtful that the facilities built by the Project can be maintained
properly in the medium term, given the poor operational and maintenance practices
of the .majority of sub-borrowers, and the financial constraints that they are
facing at the present time.   In the long run, this situation is expected to
improve once the decentralization of the sector, which has been underway since
the liquidation of INSFOPAL, begins to have its intended effect (para. 23).
Lesson Learned
7.    The following lessons can be drawn from the implementation of the Project:
(a)   The Bank should not have aareed to finance the Project given the
poor performance records of the borrower in the projects under
execution at the time of the appraisal, and the extremely large
number of weak beneficiaries.   At t;.e time of appraisal, INSFOPAL
clearly did not have the commitment to develop itself into a
technically  competent  intermediary.    Conditionality  under  the
Project could not have compensated for the lack of commitment.
(b)   Once the Bank had decided to finance this risky project, it should
have assigned enough staff time for intensive supervision. A full-
time task manager, an engineer, a lawyer and two financial analysts
would have been necessary at least during the first year of Project
implementation. However, the allocation of such an extraordinary
amount of resources would not have been compatible with Bank's
practices in assigning manpower for supervision.   Likewise, when
significant implementation problems were discovered, the Bank's
administration should have taken more decisive actions to compel the
borrower to comply with conditionality.   The initiation of the
technical assistance component and the fulfilling of the conditions
for the first disbursement were handled with extreme laxity by
INSFOPAL and the sub-borrowers.
(c)   Financial supervision was weak despite the enormous time spent by
supervision missions in reviewing financial information. This was
due to a large extent to the inability of INSFOPAL to establish a
system to keep track of the evolution of its finances and those of
the sub-borrowers. The historical data on financial statements and
their corresponding analysie should have been collected and included
systematically  in the supervision reports but were not.   rhe
supervision reports on file contain little data on finances.
(d)   The economic systems of INSFOPAL and most of the sub-borrowers' were
weak and unreliable. The audit reports of the independent auditors
were generally furnished to the Bank late and with qualified
opinions. The Bank could not get INSFOPAL and the sub-borrowers to
solve this problem, nor did the Project include adequate provision
to deal with this problem even though the SAR recognized it.

Sector:           Water Supply and Sewerage
B.          Backoround
1.          Sector Development Objectives. At the time of Project appraisal, the
Government's plans were to provide piped water to 90% of the urban population and
80% of the rural non-dispersed population (communities with over 200 inhabitants)
by 1990. Its goals for sewerage service levels were 80% and 55%, respectively.
In addition, the Government had explicitly recognized the need to expand services
to the low-income population and expected to accomplish this by using cross-
subsidization among different income consumer groups. The major constraint in
ach..eving these sector goals appeared to be the absorptive capacity of the
executing entities, especially in the case of small cities and rural areas.
Institution building and training to help remove these constraints were to be
daveloped with the assistance of the international institutions. The proposed
Project included a technical assistance program for INSFOPAL and the sub-
borrowers.
2.          Policy Context.  The Government's development strategy was aimed at
expanding the water supply and sewerage services to a large number of urban and
rural population. To this end the Government prepared a national plan (PLANAL)
containing a program with priorities for the allocation of investments within the
sector.   Investments were planned to be financed from external sources,
Government and INSFOPAL loans and internally generated funds of the participating
utilities. In addition, the expression of interest on the part of a community
in contributing to finance a percentage of the investment costs and a commitment
to operate and maintain the services were taken into account in determining
investment priorities.

C.          Proiect ObieEtives and Descrintion
3.          Project Objectives. The specific objectives of the Project were: (a)
to continue strengthening INSFOPAL's operational capabilitiee; lb) to contribute
to the development of the Regional or Municipal Sanitary Works Companies (EMPOS),
Municipal Public Companies (EPMI), and water utilities depending on those EMPOS
and responsible for services in the cities to be benefitted by the Project, and
to create and organize financially viable companies; (c) to provide potable water
to approximately 472,000 additional inhabitants of 19 cities by 1983; (d) to
provide sewerage service to approximately 654,000 additional inhabitants of 14
cities by 1983; (e) to improve and increase water production and transmission
facilities in order to cover the demands of the 1990 population of the above-
mentioned cities; (f) to provide urgently needed works to prevent undesirable
sewage discharges into open storm drains and to _,roteCt water supply sources from
further contaminationt .. (g) to reduce unaccounted-for water in these cities
from ar average of 40% at the time of appraisal to not more than 25% by 1986.
4.          Project Description.  The Project provided f'--
(a)   the construction of new facilities or optimization of existing
water treatment facilities for the cities of Cartagena, Neiva,
Monteria, Riohacha, Girardot, Copacabana, Rio Negro, Calarca,
Aguachica, Magangue, Codazzi, Pamplona, Chiquinquira, and
Espinal;
(b)   the construction of pumping  and transmission  facilities
connecting the water production facilities of the city of
Barranquilla to the distribution system of the city of
Soledad;
(c)   the improvement of water intakes, pumping stations, and raw
water transmission lines in 14 cities;
(d)   the construction of additional water storage in 16 cities with
an aggregate capacity of about 60,000 m3.
(e)   the extension of water distribution networks in 19 cities,
with an aggregate length of about 420 km;
(f)   the  construction  of  about  80,000  metered  house  water
connections in 16 cities and the purchase and installation of
about 62,000 residential water meters;
(g)   the purchase and installation of water production meters;
(h)   the construction of sewers in 14 cities, with an aggregate
length of about 400 km;
(i)   the construction of interceptors and outfalls in 11 cities
with an aggregate length of about 80 km;



-3
(j)   the  construction  of  about  110,000  household  sewerage
connections;
(k)   the construction of water pumping stations in four cities and
sewage pumping stations in three cities;
(1)   construction of stabilization ponds for sewage treatment in
the city of Sabanalarga; and
(m)   a technical assistance program for: (i) improvements of the
organizational   procedures   of   INSFOPAL,    under   the
responsibility of its Institutional Development Unit, using
consultants as needed in the areas of planning, financing,
organization, and engineering; and (ii) improvement of the
operational capability of the EPMs and EMPOS (including the
acquisition of office and laboratory equipment) through the
use of consultant services, under the supervision of
INSFOPAL's Department of Assistance to Executing Agencies.
D.          Project Design and Organization
5.          Project preparation and design were carried out by INSFOPAL with the
Bank's assistance.   Individual feasibility studies for each subproject were
prepared by INSFOPAL with the aid of local consultants. The feasibility studies
were found satisfactory by the Bank. These studies recommended the least-cost
solution in each case; however, in two cities, Dos Quebradas and Soledad,
additional studies were deemed necessary to select the least-cost alternative for
some Project components.
6.          The Project was fairly well prepared and its timing was in general
appropriate. However, the appraisal team did not conduct an on-site evaluation
of the proposed beneficiaries and the works prepared by them; instead it relied
on the assessment made by each beneficiary and INSFOPAL.1  Some of the Bank
staff who reviewed the SAR expressed doubts about the validity of some of the
information collected, and recommended a post-appraisal mission, which was never
undertaken. Later, during Project implementation, the inconsistencies in the
information provided by the beneficiaries became clear and it became necessary
to review the subproject description and prepare new financial projections for
the majority of beneficiaries.  Another drawback of the Project was that the
technical component aimed at improving INSFOPAL in the areas of administration,
organization, financing and planning was only generally defined, with no precise
procedures established for carrying out this task. For the beneficiaries, this
component originally included studies to improve their accounting system and to
create  an  information  system  on  their  services  and  performance.    The
implementation schedule for this component was also $X  optimistic.  It called
1 The number of beneficiaries ultimately was reduced from 23 to 21; three
of them, Copacabana, Calarca and Dos Quebradas, decided not to participate in the
Project and were replaced by Ipiales and Popayan, and Tumaco was cancelled
because it did not comply with the conditions for the first disbursement.

for introducing improvements in the beneficiaries' accounting system to permit
full disclosure of the statement of sources and applications of funds, asseto
revaluation and tariff studies for each beneficiary by October 31, 1979. This
was highly unrealistic in view of the fact that the beneficiaries lacked a proper
accrual accounting system. Later, in December 1981, the scope of the technical
component was increased to include studies on billing and collection, operation
and maintenance, budg3t preparation and control, internal control, and planning.
7.          The  first  Project  Brief  states  among  the  main  issues  the
reorganization of INSFOPAL, its limited absorptive capacity to carry out the
Project, slow tariff adjustment procedures, and delays in the Government's
counterpart fund contributions.   The Project included a technical assistance
component and some covenants to deal with thene issues, but actions either were
not carried out or were carried out with substantial delays (para. 9).
8.          The Project's cost was estimated at US$71.9 million, with US$31.0
million of foreign costs. The Bank loan was to finance the foreign costs. The
Government was to finance US$31.7 million of local costs. The balance in the
amount of US$9.2 million was to be financed by the beneficiaries.
E.          Proiect ImDlementation
9.          Loan Signature, Effectiveness and Project Startup.  Loan 1726-CO was
approved by the Board on June 12, 1979 and was signed on November 30, 1979, with
some delays. There was also a minor delay in declaring the Loan effective, which
took place on February 28, 1980. However, a major delay occurred because the
sub-borrowers delayed compliance with the conditions for the first disbursement
for about three years.  These conditions included presentation of a plan for
institutional improvement, signature of the respective subsidiary loan agreement, 2
and approval and implementation of tariff increases. The delay was mainly due
to the slowness in the implementation of tariff increases and preparation of
adequate financial forecasts required to determine the financial monitoring
indicators to be included in the subsidiary loan agreements.3  Even though the
preparation of the Project and bidding process continued and it was possible to
begin some of the works with the part of the funds provided by the Government,
the delay in the fulfillment of the conditions for first disbursement
significantly affected the startup of the Project.
2 The subsidiary loan agreements included provisions regarding financial
covenants and monitoring indicators, insurance of assets, procurement, etc.
3 As of December 1982 only five sub-borrowers had been declared eligible for
disbursement: Sabanalarga, Soledad, Valledupar, Rio Negro, and Ibague. On June
13, 1983 thirteen more sub-borrowers were declared eligible: Neiva, Pasto,
Sincelejo, Girardot, Codazzi, Cartago, Espinal, Panplona, Monteria, Riohacha,
Magangue, Aguachica, Cartagena y Chiquinquira. Ipiales and Popayan were still
working to fulfill the conditions and would eventually subst: ute Calarca, Dos
Quebradas and Copacabana. Tumaco was cancelled from the Project.



-5-
10.         Implementation schedule.  The Project was originally scheduled to be
completed by December 1983, but the majority of the works under the Project were
not completed until June 1987 or three and a half years later than scheduled.
The remaining facilities were completed or planned to be completed by December
1988, 4 about five years later than the target date (Table 5, Part III).  The
technical assistance component of the Project was only partially completed (Table
7, Part II'). The main reasons for not completing or delaying the completion of
the Project, in addition to the ones already mentioned in paragraph 9, were as
follows:
(a)   The procurement process was slow, mainly because INSFOPAL and
the sub-borrowers did not have sufficient experience in
lealing with the Bank's procurement procedures--which differ
in many respects from Colombian law (para. 11).
(b,   INSFOPAL and the sub-borrowers lacked good management or
sufficient number of qualified staff to handle the project
implementation.
(c)   INSFOPAL lacked commitment to the Project and the Bank was
unwilling to press the Institute to fulfill its commitments.
Part A of the Project included studies for the institutional
development of ISSFOPAL and the sub-borrowers. These studies-
-which were important to improve the organization, the
accounting systems, operation and planning of INSFOPAL and the
sub-borrowers--were handled poorly by INSFOPAL, which did not
staff the department in charge of this task adequately, did
not train this staff and gave low priority to the studies.
The Bank, for its part, did not supervise this component
closely and did not take strong remedial actions to encourage
its acceleration.
(d)   The Government was slow in providing the counterpart funds for
the Project and in approving tariff increases, which were
necessary for the sub-borrowers to comply with the financial
viability  criteria  stipulated  in the  Loan  Agreement  as
conditions for disbursement.
(e)   Changes were made in the scope of the Project to include other
cities (Ipiales and Popayan) and to modify the description and
scope of the components of the majority of subprojects.
4 A mission to INSFOPAL in April 1988, to provide advice about the
preparation of the PCR revealed that four beneficiaries (Monteria, Soledad,
Sincelejo and Girardot) had not completed their works. Furthermore, a visit to
Soledad indicated that the works had been halted due to financial constraints,
with much of the equipment and materials exposed to the elements and in danger
of deterioration. The Bank then asked the Government and INSFOPAL to complete the
works of these beneficiaries expeditiously, which they agreed to finish by
December 1988.



-6-
(f)   The Bank was slow in advising INSFOPAL on the preparation of
the subsidiary lending agreements. The Bank sent the lawyer
in charge of the Project in June 1981 to advise INSFOPAL after
voluminous correspondence had been exchanged on this matter.
It also seems that there was not full agreement between Bank
staff on the content of the subsidiary loan agreements. For
instance, a Bank lawyer accepted as satisfactory some of these
agreements, which did not satisfy totally the Loan Officer.
This required further analysis and time to be settled.
11.         Procurement.   The procurement process was generally slow, mainly
because:
(a)   INSFOPAL staff responsible for the procurement process were
not experienced. Although INSFOPAL had borrowed from the Bank
before, the project staff were relatively new and not familiar
with the Bank's guidelines. The principal deficiencies were:
(i) bid announcements, which did not receive international
dissemination; (ii) inadequate time allowed for preparating
tenders; (iii) contracts not awarded to the lowest evaluated
bidder; and (iv) contracts signed without prior Bank approval;
and (v) INSFOPAL's repeated requests to disburse from the loan
account in foreign currency to make payments to local
suppliers and contractors, which is contrary to the Bank's
guidelines. This required a long time to be settled.
(b)   The Instituto de Comercio Exterior  (INCOMEX) was slow in
approving import licenses.
12.         Proiect Costs.  The estimated cost of the Project at appraisal was
about US$71.9 million.   The final cost was about US$65 million, or a cost
underrun of about 9% (Table 6, Part III). This is explained basically by the
lower prices obtained in the international and local competitive bidding.
13.         Disbursements. The Loan's estimated and actual disbursements (Table
3, Part III) reflect the Project's slow implementation. The original closing
date was June 30, 1984, but the Loan was not closed until June 30, 1986, after
a two year extension.   However, the Bank honored disbursement applications
received later than this date, and the final disbursement was made on June 18,
1987. The disbursement percentage for civil works was raised from 37% to 51% in
the course of project implementation to help resolve the counterpart funding
problem.
14.         Loan  allocations.    The  original  and  actual  disbursements  by
categories are shown in Table 4 of Part III.  The original allocations were
revised in February and November of 1984 to reflect changes in the Project scope,
the creation of a special and a Project account and actual implementation needs.

F.          Proiect Results
15.         Meeting Project Objectives.  In general, the Project fell far short
of meeting its objectives. Even though the beneficiaries completed most of the
facilities originally planned, the Project was implemented with considerable
delays and the service levels of water and sewerage were somewhat lower than the
target established for 1986 (Annex 4). 5 INSFOPAL did not improve its managerial
and operational capability and was liquidated by the Government by Decree No.77
of  January  1987.6    The  beneficiaries  did  not  improve  their  financial,
operational and planning capability to the level expected at appraisal.  The
level of water losses was generally higher than the 25% targeted for 1986. 7 The
tariff studies were not done with the scope envisaged at appraisal and the tariff
increases were prepared based on gross cash-flow projections that did not take
into account the long-term economic cost of meeting the increasing demand.
Lastly the training was not undertaken. In retrospect, the lack of commitment to
the Project of INSFOPAL and the beneficiaries was the main cause of failure to
meet the objectives fully.   This lack of commitment was derived, to a large
extent, from excessive political interference.
16.         Physical Results.  The physical targets of the Project in terms of
water supply and sewerage facilities were to a large extent achieved, but with
substantial delays (Table 5, Part III).   It seems that the delay affected
somewhat the service level in the majority of the beneficiary cities.
17.         Financial Performance.  Annexes 1 and 2 showed actual and appraisal
income  statements  and actual  balance  sheets  for  INSFOPAL  for  1979-1986.
INSFOPAL's financial performance during that period was unsatisfactory.   Net
income was negative throughout the period because its revenues, generated from
interest and charges for technical and administrative services provided to the
operating companies, did not cover its increasing operating costs and the
financial charges on its borrowings. To cover the financing gap and to obtain
funds for investment, the Institute was forced to depend on increasing Government
contributions, which normally arrived with extreme tardiness. INSFOPAL also had
a poorly performing portfolio because it was unable to impose financial
discipline on its borrowers. As of 1986, for instance, 37% of the accounts
receivable on loans were overdue more than 90 days and the balance of accrued
5 As stated in the evaluation summary, the validity of the information
provided by INSFOPAL and the beneficiaries is questionable; therefore, the
conclusion regarding the service levels has to be taken with caution. No
sufficient information was available to compare the results as of 1983, the year
scheduled for Project completion.
6 When first announced, the process of liquidation was to last until
December 1989, but was later advanced to September 1989.
7 Water losses include leakages, errors in measurement due to insufficient
production and consumption meters, and theft. There was no information available
on the weight assigned to these categories in assessing results.

income from loans represented 88% of the annual income from loans, which means
that the operating companies were paying interest to INSFOPAL with a delay of
about 320 days.
18.         The financial performance of the sub-borrowers, except for a few of
them, was also unsatisfactory. Their operating ratios were generally above the
target established in the SAR, as tariff increases did not keep pace with the
increases in operating expenses; with few exceptions, the net income was
generally negative for all sub-borrowers and the current ratio was less than one,
reflecting liquidity problems (Annexes 4 and 6). The sub-borrowers accumulated
high levels of accounts receivable and were in default paying their debt service
to INSFOPAL.
19.         During appraisal the Bank had detected deficiencies in INSFOPAL's and
the sub-borrowers'accounting systems but underestimated the magnitude of the
problem. Accordingly the Project included only a general component to tackle
this situation.   Little progress was made on this, which is demonstrated by the
fact that during the implementation period (1979-87), all of INSFOPAL's audit
reports were furnished to the Bank late and all, except the one for 1985, were
issued with adverse opinions, disclaimers or qualified opinions by the
independent auditors.   The same tardiness and qualified opinions generally
characterized the reports on the majority of sub-borrowers. This situation makes
the financial data unreliable and therefore they have to be interpreted with
caution.   In any case, this will not change the basic conclusion that the
financial situation of INSFOPAL and of the majority of sub-borrowers was
unsatisfactory.
20.         The Loan included rate-of-return and self-financing ratio covenants
and other monitoring indicators that were never enforced. To a great extent this
was due to the inability of INSFOPAL and the sub-borrowers to prepare adequate
data on financial covenants, and also the inability of the Bank to supervise the
Project  adequately.    Even though the Bank devoted considerable time to
supervision, this was not enough given the large number of sub-borrowers (21),
which generally had weak accounting and administrative systems INSFOPAL, which
was supposed to undertake the bulk of this work, was not prepared to fulfill this
function, and did not staff the corresponding departments and did not train them
properly. It also has to be mentioned that the Loan included too many covenants
and monitoring indicators, underscoring the concern of the appraisal mission with
the poor finances of INSFOPAL and the sub-borrowers. In a situation like this,
it would have been better to rely on a few selected easy-to-monitor covenants.
The rate of return and the self-financing ratios are generally difficult to
monitor, because of the assets revaluation complication and the difficulty in
preparing the statement of sources and applications of funds when dealing with
weak entities. It seems that it would have been better to use the working ratio a
as the main revenue covenant, which is easier to monitor and was suitable in the
circumstances.

21.         The technical assistance component of the Project, which was the
provision included in the Loan Agreement to improve INSFOPAL and the sub-
borrowers institutionally, was scheduled to be provided at the beginning of
Project implementation. INSFOPAL did some studies on its organization, code of
functions and budget preparation in the early years of the Project, but very
little  was  implemented.    A  comprehensive  study  of  the  beneficiaries'
administration, finances and operation was started as a pilot study with three
of them in April 1984, about four years later than planned, because of cumbersome
consultant selection procedures, but mainly due to the lack of INSFOPAL's
commitment to the studies.   The Bank urged the Institute to accelerate the
preparation of the studies, but it responded slowly. The Bank could have been
tougher regarding compliance with conditionality. It might have exercised its
right under the Loan Agreement to adopt remedial actions like cancellation of
many more subprojects, after it became clear that this vital component of the
Project was not progressing satisfactorily and that INSFOPAL did not show its
real willingness to fulfill its commitment.9
22.         Impact of the Project.  The Project did not have a favorable impact
on INSFOPAL's development. It was liquidated by the Government in 1987 due to
its institutional deterioration. The Project did not fully meet the appraisal
expectation of the sub-borrowers either.   Even though the majority of sub-
borrowers completed the physical components and were able to increase somewhat
their tariffs as a result of the Project, the financial and institutional
development fell short of what was expected at appraisal.  Few sub-borrowers
improved their operating and financial conditions, and some are now worse off
than they were at the beginning of Project implementation (Annexes 4 to 6).
The water and sewerage service levels at the end of 1986 were generally lower
than those expected at appraisal due to the implementation delay.
G.          Proiect Sustainability
23.         It is doubtful that the facilities built by the Project can be
maintained properly over the medium term, given the poor operation and
maintenance practices of the majority of the sub-borrowers, and the financial
constraints that they are facing due to inflation, devaluation, rising operating
costs, low tariff increases and high water losses.   In the long run this
situation is expected to improve, once the decentralization of the sector
(underway since the liquidation of INSFOPAL) begins to take its intended effect.
H.          Bank Performance
8.01        The Bank's participation in the Project was inadequate. It decided
to take the risk of financing the Project, even though at the time of the
appraisal INSFOPAL was executing two other Loans with poor performance records,
weak organization, a shortage of technically qualified personnel and personnel
instability due to frequent changes  in top management.   The problem was
compounded by the large number of sub-borrowers, most of whom with weak
9. The Bank did cancel two subprojects.



- 10 -
management. The Bank also failed in the four aspects: (a) It under estimated the
staff input requirement to supervise a complex project like this, which would
probably have required a full-time task manager, an engineer, a lawyer, and at
least two financial analysts in the first year of Project implementation.
(b) It did not press INSFOPAL sufficiently to carry out the studies for the
institutional development expeditiously, once it noticed the slowness with which
the selection process of the consultant was going ahead.   In hindsight, the
appointment of this consultant should have been a condition of negotiation.
(c) It was not sufficiently tough with in respect to compliance with
conditionality. And (d) it delayed the declaration of eligibility for the first
disbursement to those sub-borrowers that fulfilled these conditions early,
because at the beginning the Bank had the intention to declare the eligibility
of all the sub-borrowers simultaneously. In this sense, it lost the opportunity
to use the good implementation experience of some sub-borrowers as an example to
be followed by the rest.
I.          Lessons Learned
24.         The principal lessons learned are summarized below:
(a)   The Bank should not have agreed to finance the Project, given
the poor performance records of the borrower in the projects
under execution and the extremely large number of weak
beneficiaries.
(b)   once the Bank had decided to finance this risky project, it
should have assigned more staff time for intensive
supervision. A full-time task manager, an engineer, a lawyer
and two financial analysts would have been necessary at least
during the first year of Project implementation.   This may
have allowed the Bank to monitor the development of the
Project in a timely way. However, the allocation of such an
extraordinary amount of resources would not have been
compatible with Bank practices.  Likewise, when significant
implementation problems were discovered, the Bank's management
should have taken decisive actions to seek remedies. In the
case of the Project, the initiation of the technical
assistance component and the fulfilling of the conditions for
the first disbursement were handled with extreme laxity by
INSFOPAL and the sub-borrowers.
(c)   Financial supervision was weak notwithstanding the enormous
amount of time spent by supervision missions in reviewing
financial information. This was due to a large extent to the
inability of INSFOPAL to establish a system to keep track of
the evaluation of its finances and those of the sub-borrowers.
The historical data on income statements, balance sheets and
sources and applications of funds should have been collected
and included systematically in the supervision reports but it



- 11 -
was not easy to do so. The supervision reports available in
the files contain only few data on finances.
(d)   INSFOPAL and most of the sub-borrowers' accounting systems
were weak and unreliable. The audit reports were generally
furnished to the Bank late and with qualified opinions of the
independent auditors. The Bank did not press INSFOPAL to solve
this problem, nor did the Project include adequate provision
to deal in depth with this problem even though the SAR
recognized it.
J.          Borrower and Government performance
25.         INSFOPAL's performance was  generally  unsatisfactory throughout
Project implementation even though the beneficiaries completed most of the
physical components of the Project, with about three and a half years delay.
INSFOPAL performance was poor in the following aspects: the technical assistance
components were not completed, revenue covenants were not met, net income was
negative in all the period, and portfolio performance was deficient. INSFOPAL's
management was weak and faced frequent changes of its top manager.  There were
five general managers (director general) between 1979 and 1986. INSFOPAL's
inability to retain sufficiently experienced and qualified managers and personnel
was due to: (a) low salaries compared to other Government entities, as well as
to the private sector; and (b) appointments to management, and to a large extent
to professional and even support staff positions, on the basis of political
expediency rather than qualifications.
26.         The Government for its part wanted to have in INSFOPAL an adequately
run institution responsible for coordinating, supervising, and financing sector
activities. However, it delayed the release of counterpart funds and did little
to create an atmosphere of autonomy in which to operate INSFOPAL as a business-
like institution. Frequent changes in top management led to changes even to the
lower level of management. As a result, INSFOPAL remained a largely ineffective
bureaucracy with generally poor staff resources. Under these circumstances the
Government opted for liquidating the Institute in 1987 and implementing the
process of sector decentralization that had begun in 1986.
27.         The decentralization policy was launched at the beginning of the
1980s with the popular election of mayors. Under Law 12 of January 1986, the
central Government transferred the responsibility for decision making and
administration to municipalities, which were expected to progressivelv assume
responsibilities for financing and management of municipal infrastructure,
including water supply and sewerage. The adjustments in the sector's national
organizations, mandated by Decree 77 of January 1987, established that the
National Planning Department (DNP) continue to have responsibility for planning
and coordinating sector and overall development policy. The sector's overall
management was transferred from the Ministry of Health (MOH) to the Ministry of
Public Works and Transport (MOPT). The Central Mortgage Bank (BCH), through its
Urban Development Fund, is responsible for mobilizing domestic and external
resources for sector investments and evaluating, approving, and supervising
sector projects. Law 57 of 1989 expanded the Urban Development Fund into a self-



- 12 -
standing apex agency, the Financiera de Desarrollo Territorial (FINDETER), which
became operational in May 1990.   FINDETER channels funds by rediscounting
subloans originated by commercial banks to local governments or municipal
enterprises for urban infrastructure investments, including water and sewerage.
The Bank was satisfied with the sector's organization  following  INSFOPAL
liquidation.   However, it remains to be seen if political interference with
sector institutions can be minimized and efficiency increased.
K.          Proiect RelationshiD
28.         The Bank's relationship with the Government, INSFOPAL and the sub-
borrowers was somewhat strained. INSFOPAL staff who participated closely with
the Bank's supervision missions resented the Bank and believed that it was
instrumental in the liquidation of the Institute.
L.          Consulting Services
29.         Fifteen consultants participated in carrying out the technical
assistance component of the Project, and at least one consultant per each sub-
borrower, participated in the engineering design of the water and sewerage
facilities and in the supervision of construction contracts.   INSFOPAL, in
general, was satisfied with the work of the consultants. However, it considered
that some of the firms that worked on the technical assistance components did not
have enough experience with water supply utilities and that this delayed the
execution of the works.
M.          Proiect Documentation and Data
30.         The Loan Agreement and the Staff Appraisal Report were adequate for
Project implementation. The Loan Agreement provided flexibility for introducing
changes in Project description, which required only regional approval. However,
it included too many covenants, key monitoring indicators and reports to be
met/submitted by INSFOPAL and the sub-borrowers. This was difficult to supervise
and a heavy load for such weak institutions.   INSFOPAL prepared a project
completion report, but the information was not fully consistent.

1.          Annex I of the report reproduces the "Conclusions" chapter of the
final report prepared by IVSFOPAL (an unofficial translation into English is
attached).   Its main points are the following:  (a) Seventeen beneficiaries
completed satisfactorily the works included in the Project, but with a time
overrun of two years due to the delays on the part of the Government to provide
sufficient counterpart funds and to a slow procurement process.   (b) Four
boneficiaries (Monteria, Soledad, Sincelejo and Girardot) had not completed their
works at the time of the issuance of the final report prepared by the Borrower
(July 1988), and INSFOPAL asked the Government to provide the funds needed to
complete these works. (c) The Project benefitted a large number of people. (d)
The institutional components of the Project were only partially completed. (e)
The training undertaken was relatively small. Lastly (f) The tariffs of the
beneficiaries were increasing in mid-1988 in line with inflation, due to some
extent to the participation of INSFOPAL.

lo cual se demuestra con el Optimo servicio de agua potable suministrado y con
la alta cobertura constatada tanto para el sistema de acueducto como el de
alcantarillado, para aquellos proyectos que fueren del caso.
De la parte A, del convenio de prestamo, se considera que su ejecucion fue
parcial.
En primera instancia, el programa FOREC contaba con buenos augurios sin
embargo, la etapa de implementaci6n de los manuales tuvo muchas dificultades
para formalizar su ejecucidn, ya que se presentaron inconvenientes en los
organismos ejecutores provenientes de la poca capacidad gerencial y tdcnica,
asL como falta de interes por parte de estos organismos.
El objetivo del programa es loable, porque tiende a fortalecer t6cnica,
administrativa y financieramente a los Organismos Ejecutores, de tal forma que
en el proceso de descentralizacidn administrativa formulado mediante el
Decreto No. 77 del 15 de Enero de 1987, por parte dtel Gobierno Nacional, es de
urgente prioridad la utilizaci6n e implementaci6n de los manuales de los
sistemas financiero, comercial y de recursos humanos, para las nuevas
entidades que dirigiran los servicios pablicos en el pals.
En cuanto a; la capacitaci6n de personal mediante recursos del convenio de
prestamo, se concluye que fue relativamente poca, para los funcionarios de la
Subdireccidn de Proyectos con recursos externos del Insfopal. Unicamente se
lLmit6 a un monto de $ 1.93 millones, para cursos de especializacion de
algunos funcionarios y otros cursos de menor escala con la asesorla de Acodal.
La adquisicidn de equipos de deteccidn de fugas, macromedidores, pitometrla y
de laboratorio no se pudo efectuar, porque surgieron problemas con la
licitacidn pGblica internacional No. INSF-BIII-02/86.
El plazo orlginaLmente programado para la ejecucidn del proyecto era de 4 aflos
a partir de la firma de los contratos, pero debido a incontables
circunstancias que se presentaron desde la etapa de formulacidn de los

contratos de pr4stamo, pasando por los diseflos, evaluacion, contratacidn,
hasta la ejecuci6n de las obras, fue necesario ampliar su terminacin en un
plazo de 2 aflos. Entre los principales aspectos se encontraron la demora del
Gobierno Nacional en asignar los recursos de contrapartida a fin de agilizar
los desembolsos del credito externo, y al dilatado proceso administrativo para
la contratacidn de las obras, por parte de Los Organismos Ejecutores y del
Insfopal.
Finalmente el Banco otorg6 un altimo plaza para la terminaci6n del proyecto
hasta Diciembre 31/86, el cual se cumplio logrando utilizarse la totaLidad de
los recursos externos por un monto de US$ 30.54 millones ejerciendo una
en6rgica actividad para dejar terminadas y en funcionamiento las obras
programadas.
En cumplimiento de los requisitos establecidos por el convenio de prestamo, el
Insfopal a trav6s de los asnos de ejecucidn del programa, solicit6 a los
Organismos Ejecutores beneficiarios del crddito, el diligenciamiento de los
servicios de Auditoria Externa, con consultores debidamente inscritos para la
prestacion del auditaje a los estados financieros de las empresas. El objetivo
de estas auditorlas anuales se logr6 en un gran porcentaje en raz6n a que la
mayoria de los Organismos Ejecutores acataron y apLicaron las recomendaciones
de los auditores en lo concerniente al sistema administrativo, financiero y
comercial.
El programa de medidores se desarroll.  mediante la licitacion pctblica
internacional No. INSF-BIII-S-01-85, benefici5ndose doce (12) localidades, a
saber : Cartagena, Pasto, Neiva, Magangu6, Popaydn, Aguachica, Codazzi,
Pamplona, Chiquinquirl, Espinal, Sincelejo e Ipiales, por un valor total de
USs 400.546.80, con la adquisicidn global de 35.890 medidores, los cuales
fueron instalados producidndose un efecto de mayor rentabilidad para los
Organismos Ejecutores, al tener un mayor control para contabilizar el agua a
facturar.
El camblo de los porcentajes de financiacidn por parte del Banco Mundial, del
37Z a] 512 para la construcciOn de obras.civiles locales, influyeron
notoriamente en la utilizacion pronta y oportuna de los recursos del credito
externo por cuanto los desembolsos efectivos se incrementaban en mayor
proporcion a la financiacidn normal.
Las obras desarrolladas en l.o  sistemas de acueducto y alcantarillado, cumplen
con las especificaciones tecnicas establecidas de acuerdo a los sanos
principios de la ingenieria y especialmente con el Decreto 2105 del 26 de
Juliol83 del Ministerio de Salud.
Pese a las restricciones de tipo tarifario que han afectado al sector de
Acueducto y Alcantarillado a trav4s de los ados, el Insfopal haciendo urgentes
esfuerzos para dar cumplimiento a la cliusula relativa a tarifas hizo el
seguimiento a cada uno de los proyectos, elaborando oportunamente Las
solicitudes de modificacl6n tarifaria y present5ndolas ante la Junta Nacional
de Tarifas, por los que en la actualidad todas las localidades incluidas en el
programa aplican una indexaciOn mensual, lo que les permite mantener el valor
real de las tarifas.

CONCL-USION
The foregoing material and the close-of-investment reports sent in
by the beneficiary towns lead to the following conclusions:
With regard to Part B of the Loan Agreement, project works in
Monteria, Soledad, Sincelejo and Girardot are still not completed. However, in
view of the Government's undertaking, incorporated in the Loan Agreement itself,
to complete all civil engineering components, an application has been lodged with
the National Planning Department for the necessary resources, in accordance with
the estimates, quantity surveys, schedules and other verifying documentation
prepared by INSFOPAL's Projects Department.
All the other 17 towns that were beneficiaries under Part B of the
Loan Agreement satisfactorily completed all project works as programed and/or
modified and/or added, bringing considerable benefit to mijor communities in
the form of high-grade water production facilities and high-coverage water supply
and sewerage systems.
As far as Part A of the Loan Agreement is concerned, its execution
must be considered partial.  Initially, there were high hopes for the FOREC
Program.  However, when it came to the point of acting on the guidelines
developed, many difficulties hindered their actual implementation, in particular
the scarcity of managerial and technical know-how among the executing agencies
and their lack of motivation.
~The objectives of the Program are laudable, focused as they aro on
strengthening the executing agencies in the technical, administrative and
financial spheres. For instance, since promulgation of the Government's Decree
No. 77 of January 15, 1987, an urgent priority for the country's new utility
service agencies is to adopt and apply the guidelines on financial, commercial
and personnel management systems.
With regard to training funded from Loan proceeds, INSFOPAL Projects
Department personnel received relatively little benefit from the external
resources allocated for this purpose. In all., no more than $1.93 million was
spent on specialization courses for some staff and other less advanced courses
organized in conjunction with ACODAL.

Leakage detection equipment, macrometers, pitometers and laboratory
equipment could not be purchased because of problems with international
competitive bidding process No. INSF-BIII-02/86.
The period originally allowed for project execution was four years
from signing of the Loan Agreement. However, owing to innumerable circumstances
encountered from the stage when onlending contracts were being written, during
the design, appraisal and procurement stages, and throughout the works execution
stage, it was necessary to extend the execution period by two years.  Major
difficulties were the Government's tardiness in allocating counterpart resources,
which in turn held up the disbursement of external funds, and the lengthy nature
of the administrative process through which the executing agencies and INSFOPAL
awarded works contracts. Ultimately, the Bank agreed to extend the execution
period for the last time until December 31, 1986, which was adhered to. Total
external resources of US$30.54 million were utilized, and a determined effort
was made to complete the works programmed and bring them on line.
Throughout the project execution period, INSFOPAL, as required under
the Loan Agreement, urged the beneficiary executing agencies to contract for the
services of external auditors duly certified in the corporate field. The goal
of annual audits was achieved in a high percentage of cases, and the majority
of the executing agencies heeded and applied their auditors' recommendations
regarding the administrative, financial and commercial aspects of their
activities.
The metering program began with international competitive bidding
process no. INSF-BIII-S-01-85, benefiting 12 towns, namely, Cartagena, Pasto,
Neiva, Magangud, Popayd, Aguachica, Codazzi, Pamplona, Chiquinquird, Espinal,
Sincelejo and Ipiales. A total of US$400,546.80 was spent on purchasing 35,890
meters. Their installation improved the executing agencies' investment returns
by enabling them to base their billing on actual water use.
The increase in the Bank's contribution to civil engineering costs
from 37% to 51% had a marked impact on the prompt and timely draw down of Loan
proceeds, since actual disbursements were larger than would normally have been
the case.
Water supply and sewerage system works were executed to technical
specifications prescribed in accordance not only with sound engineering
principles but also with the provisions of Ministry of Health Decree 2105 of
July 26, 1983.
Despite the tariff restrictions that have affected the water supply
and sewerage sector through the years, INSFOPAL, as part of its fulfillment of
Loan Agreement requirements on the subject of tariffs, monitored each subproject
closely and lodged tariff amendment applications with the National Tariffs Board
promptly. As a result, beneficiary towns now apply monthly indexation, which
enables them to keep up the real value of their tariffs.
