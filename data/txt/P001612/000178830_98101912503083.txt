FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Effects of Geography and Economic Structure on Transport
1.01      Malawi is a long, narrow, landlocked country situated in the Great
African Rift Valley, with a land area of about 94,300 km and a lake area of
24,200 km (see Map 1). A major escarpment runs the length of the country,
separating the Lake Malawi plain from the plateau to the west; altitudes
range from about 60 m above sea level in the Shire Valley in the south to
over 2,500 m in the northern plateau. Rainfall averages between 750 mm and
1,600 mm, but is much heavier in the high plateau areas of Mulanje, Zomba,
Viphya and Nyika (4% of land area). The high rainfall and long rainy season
in the mountainous areas, combined with steep slopes and scarcity of naturally
available gravels for road construction and maintenance, render gravel roads
uneconomic in those areas.
1.02      Gross domestic product increased in real terms at the relatively
rapid rate of 6.0% per year over the period 1964-79. Even so, per capita
GNP is an estimated US$200, and Malawi is classified by the United Nations
as one of the least developed countries in the world.
1.03      With a population of about 5.7 million (1978), growing at an average
rate of 2.9% p.a., Malawi has one og the highest population densities per sq
km of agricultural land (140 per km ) in Africa. However, development in the
country's three administrative regions has been unbalanced. Until independence
in 1964, most development was concentrated in the Southern Region, which had
the only rail link, most of the all-weather roads, the administrative capital
of Zomba and the main commercial center of Blantyre. This fundamental
imbalance, aggravated by the still inadequate road access to the north, has
caused the Central Region and, even more, the Northern Region to remain
isolated and undeveloped, and the latter is still sparsely populated.   At
present, almost three quarters of the total population lives in the southern
half of the country, and one of Government's main socioeconomic objectives,
as set out in the Statement of Development Policies (1971), is the promotion
of more balanced regional development. To this end, it has moved the adminis-
trative capital some 250 km north from Zomba to Lilongwe, and has initiated
several agricultural development projects in the northern half of the country,
including major projects at Lilongwe, Salima, Karonga and Viphya, and smaller
projects around Kasungu and Mzimba. The road network is also gradually being
upgraded in the Central and Northern Regions, and further development in these
areas is planned under the National Rural Development Program.



- 2 -
1.04      Since almost 90% of the population lives in rural areas, and
agriculture contributes over 90% of Malawi's exports, rural development is
a primary economic and social objective. In addition to raising agricultural
productivity, it is seen as an effective vehicle for the Government's policy
of redistributing incomes in favor of the rural poor. Although the most
rapid growth in agricultural output in the past has been achieved by private
estates and discrete regional projects, since the start of its National Rural
Development Program in the mid-1970s, Government has increasingly supported
agricultural development through minimum package rural development projects
with rather wide geographic coverage. The Bank Group has given considerable
support to this Program, and is currently preparing for its third phase.
1.05      About 50% of Malawi's total land area is classified as forest land,
about 20% of which consists of forest reserves, administered by the Forestry
Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources as protected
government land. Malawi's forestry sector produces a limited number of
forestry products: sawn timber, veneer, plywood, poles and fuelwood.
Annual production 3of industrial roundwood from both state and private forests
is about 85,000 m . The wood is locally processed and largely absorbed by the
domestic market, as exports of forest products are negligible and some 20% of
the softwood requirements are imported. However, the Government is now
studying the possibility of developing the wood processing industry, including
the potential of the regional export market.
B. The Transport System
1.06      Malawi's transport system consists of about 11,300 km of roads,
645 km of railways, 4 lake harbors and a number of landing points served by a
lake service, and 4 airfields served by domestic services. The principal
features of this system are: a main road network of about 2,900 km, which is
fairly well developed south of Lilongwe but undeveloped in the northern half
of the country; the rail system which lies entirely in the southern half of
the country and is primarily used for export-import and Zambian transit
traffic; lake transport which mainly serves the north and compensates to some
extent for the undeveloped land transport links; and air transport which is
dominated by international passenger traffic. Road transport dominates
internal transport while most export-import freight is carried by rail. The
main outlet to the sea for Malawi's external trade is by the railway through
Mozambique to the ports of Beira and Nacala on the Indian Ocean.
Highways
1.07      The highway network is discussed in Chapter II.
Railways
1.08      The main railway line extends from Salima through Blantyre, to the
extreme southern border (443 km) where it connects with the rail line to the



- 3 -
Mozambique port of Beira. Rehabilitation of the southern part of the line
within Malawi has been underway during the last few years with British and
Canadian aid and is expected to be completed by 1985. A branch line (101 km),
offering an alternative route to the sea, extends eastward from Nkaya to
Nayuci, and connects with the Mozambique line to the port of Nacala. 1/ An
extension westward from Salima to Lilongwe (101 km), financed by a grant from
the Canadian Government, has been recently completed and operations commenced
in 1979. The Canadian Government is also financing a further extension
westward from Lilongwe through Mchinji to the Zambian border (109 km), which
is expected to be in operation by 1981-82. The ultimate aim is to link Malawi
Railways with the Tanzania-Zambia Railway. 2/
1.09      In 1978, the railway carried about 1.3 million tons of freight or
about 221 million ton-km, about one fifth of which was Zambian transit traffic
trucked to and from railheads in Malawi. Traffic in terms of ton-km has been
declining by 7% p.a. since 1975 because of the slowdown in imports since 1975
and exports since 1977, decreasing Zambian transit traffic, and to a lesser
extent increasing road competition. The railway is run efficiently and earns
a modest net operating surplus, although recently it has experienced a shortage
of rolling stock which is gradually being corrected with the provision of more
equipment. The number of passengers carried on the railway was 1.1 million in
1978, about the same number as carried in 1974; increases in passenger traffic
have been absorbed by bus services.
Lake Transport
1.10      Freight and passenger transport on Lake Malawi is provided by Lake
Services Limited, a subsidiary of Malawi Railways, and principally serves
the remote northern areas of the country. Twenty-one centers are served by
the Lake Service fleet, which consists of five vessels carrying freight or
passengers, six barges and oil pontoons, five tugs and one timber pontoon.
Traffic volumes are relatively light, amounting to about 37,000 tons of
freight and some 111,000 passengers in 1978. The main products transported
by lake are petroleum products, rice and fertilizers. At present, nearly 70%
of the traffic is northbound, originating at Chipoka which is served by the
railway, but this pattern may change in the future as the impact of ongoing
rural development projects in the north is felt. After many years of losses,
the Lake Service realized a small operating surplus in 1978 because of freight
tariff increases in 1977 and 1978 which enabled the company to improve its
financial performance.
1/   The condition of the line and equipment as well as operational problems
of the Mozambique railway and at the sea ports have led to frequent
interruptions to traffic and severe problems over the importation of
essential materials, and particularly fuel, in recent years.
2/   This would require construction of an approximately 320 km link in Zambia.



-4-
Air Transport
1.11      Air transport within Malawi is relatively unimportant compared to
other modes, and only four airports (Chileka near Blantyre, Lilongwe, Mzuzu
and Karonga) have scheduled services. Even air traffic between the north and
the south is quite low, despite the poor roads, because most passengers and
goods are transported by lake and road. Only the Chileka airport can accom-
modate long-range jet aircraft, and it therefore serves as the country's
international airport in addition to being the most important for domestic
traffic due to its proximity to commercial centers. Chileka accounted for
nearly 60% of Malawi's 355,000 recorded passenger movements in 1978 and 80% of
passenger movements at Chileka were international. The Government is now
constructing a second international airport at Lilongwe at an estimated cost
of US$62 million with assistance from the African Development Bank (AfDB) and
the Japanese Government. Air Malawi, a Government-owned airline, provides
international services and all scheduled domestic services. Four foreign
airlines also provide international services, and one local company and Air
Malawi provide unscheduled domestic services.
1.12      Passenger traffic declined sharply in 1976 because of the cessation
of air services between Malawi and Zimbabwe, and the decreased numbers of
migrant workers going to South Africa; in 1978 traffic was only 80% of the
1975 level. Since air traffic between Malawi and Zimbabwe has now resumed,
air passenger traffic should increase significantly. Air freight traffic, on
the other hand, sizeably increased during the past few years because of the
congested ports and poor rail service in Mozambique, and difficulty of using
other modes to transport goods between South Africa and Malawi.
C. Transport Policy and Coordination
1.13      Since the beginning of the seventies, Malawi-s transport policy has
had three broad aims: (a) to improve the administrative, social and economic
integration of the country by linking all three regions with reliable all-
weather connections; (b) to support rural development by improving access to
rural areas; and (c) to provide efficient links with transport routes to the
Indian Ocean seaports for exports and imports. Substantial progress has been
made on (a) and (c), and work is now underway to realize (b). The Government
is undertaking an extensive transport development program; numerous transport
studies have been carried out or are in progress, and investments are either
planned or underway in all transport modes.
1.14      Government s overall sector priorities are given in its "Statement
of Development Policies 1971-1980," and are determined in more detail in a
3-year rolling public sector investment program which is revised annually
during budget preparation. Investment in the transport sector has been high
during the last four years, representing an average of 44% of total Government
capital expenditure. This has been due to investment in the railway exten-
sions and in Lilongwe International Airport. Although the Bank Group expressed
reservations about these projects, Government has undertaken them with the
assistance of external donors, because of its concern about the vulnerability



- 5 -
of existing international trade routes, particularly in view of recent events
in Mozambique which halted transit traffic for three months. For the same
reason, Government has requested financing under the proposed project for
upgrading of the North-South road which links Malawi to Tanzania (para. 3.03).
In addition, financing has been secured from the European Development Fund
(EDF) for a study of the international transport routes available to Malawi;
the study will examine the transport constraints to development of the country,
future changes in the composition of traffic as well as the direction of
trade, and will make recommendations on the future transport development
strategy to employ. UNDP/UNCTAD is financing a regional study 1/ of transit
transport is eight southern African countries, including Malawi. The study
is expected to be completed in 1982.
1.15      The 3-year plan 2/ for FY1979-81 had allocated 40% of total
planned capital expenditures to the transport sector (Table 1.1), mainly for
the railway from Lilongwe to the Zambian border, the Lilongwe International
Airport, and main road construction. Although various donors have expressed
interest in most of the new projects proposed to start under the plan, it
seems likely that some of these projects will be delayed or scaled down during
the 3-year period due to Government s probable inability to provide the
required local funds (only 63% of the amount planned for 1979/80 was actually
allocated) and the lack of completed feasibility studies for many of the new
projects. A cutback in the plan is, in fact, advisable since a significant
number of the road projects may be quite marginal (para. 2.22).

Details of the Plan will not be available before March 1981, but a
draft summary indicates that, over the 5 years, 35% of total planned
capital expenditures will be allocated to the transport sector.



-6-
1.16      Coordination of transport investment plans is the responsibility
of the Transport Unit of the Economic Planning Division (EPD) of the Office
of the President and Cabinet which reviews proposals put forward by the
Ministry of Works and Supplies (MWS) for roads and the Ministry of Transport
and Communications (MTC) for all other modes. In practice, however, such
coordination has been lacking because of EPD's limited staffing (the Transport
Unit is presently staffed by one professional only), and as a result the
development of each mode has proceeded almost independently of the others.
This is becoming a problem since road transport is beginning to compete with
the railways, and coordination of road and lake transport will be increasingly
needed. Government has therefore requested assistance in strengthening its
transport planning and coordination capability, and accordingly the project
would provide EPD with technical assistance for transport planning as well as
overseas training for local staff (para. 3.09 (iv)). The technical assistance
would, inter alia, help Government to define and establish an adequate system
of transport planning and provide on-the-job training for Malawian professional
staff. Terms of reference for the technical assistance are given in Annex 7.
D. Previous Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.17      The Bank Group has been involved in Malawi's transport sector since
1966 when Credit S-2-MAI was approved to help finance detailed engineering
of the Zomba-Lilongwe road (290 km). This was followed by the First Highway
Project (Credit 112-MAI, 1968, US$11.5 million) comprising the reconstruction
and bituminous paving of that road, the refinancing of Credit S-2-MAI, and a
consultants' study of road transport licensing regulations and road-rail
coordination. A Performance Audit of the Project (No. 946, December 15, 1975)
concluded that all of the project's objectives were achieved. Construction
costs were within appraisal estimates, although the road was completed about
one year behind schedule. 1/ Traffic was about 50% greater than projected at
appraisal, and the rate of return was conservatively re-evaluated at 13%,
compared with the appraisal estimate of 12%. The consultants' study recom-
mended deregulating road transport, raising axle load limits to 9 tons,
improving transport statistics, and relating rail tariffs more closely to
economic factors, all of which have been implemented, although there is scope
for further refinement of rail tariffs. The study expressed misgivings about
planned rail projects, but Government did not share IDA-s reservations and
proceeded with these investments. Both the consultants' study and the Audit
Report agreed that the country might soon have an oversupply of transport
services in the Blantyre-Lilongwe-Zambian border corridor. The major recom-
mendations of the Audit called for closer project supervision 2/ and rectify-
ing the neglect of lower class roads--although the Audit did not question
1/   The first contractor selected for the Zomba-Lilongwe road section
was unsatisfactory and had to be replaced, leading to the delay in
project completion.
2/   The Audit notes that the first IDA supervision mission was some 18
months after commencement of works, and that an earlier mission could
have led to speedier resolution of the problem.



-7-
the composition of the First Highway Project, noting that the "Zomba-Lilongwe
road . . . is undoubtedly the most important highway in Malawi." Both of the
recommendations made in the Audit Report are being addressed under the Second,
Third and the proposed Fourth Highway Projects and in the agricultural projects
financed by the Bank Goup (para. 1.20).
1.18      The Second Highway Project (Credit 523-MAI, 1974, US$10 million)
originally comprised construction of the Lilongwe-Kasungu road (113 km) and
a pilot scheme for the improvement and maintenance of district roads serving
rural development in the Kasungu District. Both components have been com-
pleted, the construction in March 1978, a few months behind schedule, and the
pilot scheme in September 1978. Substantial cost savings were made on the
construction component which are being used to finance completion of the
pilot scheme in Kasungu district and extension of the scheme to three other
districts, following the recommendations of a consultants' study which eva-
luated the results of the pilot program. The four districts make up the first
phase of a District Roads Improvement and Maintenance Program (DRIMP) planned
to cover all of Malawi's 24 districts in three phases.
1-.19     The Third Highway Project (Credit 758-MAI, 1977, US$10.5 million)
comprised construction of the Kasungu-Jenda road (85 km) and a feasibility
study and detailed engineering of the Jenda-Mzuzu road. The road construction
was completed in October 1980, a few months behind schedule, and the detailed
engineering is complete.
1.20      Finally, transport components have been included in IDA projects
in other sectors (Annex 1). Credit S-17-MAI, 1974, provided US$2 million
for planning and engineering of infrastructure for the proposed Viphya timber
exploitation scheme. In addition, agricultural projects in the Lower Shire
Valley (Credits 114, 363 and 823-MAI), the Lilongwe (Credits 113, 244 and
550-MAI) and the Karonga (Credit 282 and Loan 1286-MAI) areas, as well as
the more widespread National Rural Development Project (Credit 857-MAI) have
included improvement and construction of about 4,000 km of feeder and crop
extraction roads, while the Karonga Rural Development Project also includes
port improvements at Chilumba and Chipoka on Lake Malawi as well as procurement
of a self-propelled barge for the lake service.
II. THE HIGHWAY SUBSECTOR
A. The Network
2.01      The classified road network totals about 11,300 km (Table 2.1) of
which some 2,360 km (about 20%) are paved, and 380 km are of engineered gravel
standard; the rest are earth roads and tracks. In addition, there are about
2,000 km of as yet unclassified feeder and crop extraction roads constructed
to minimum all-weather standard under agricultural development projects and
an undetermined length of unclassified earth roads and tracks, including
about 800 km within forestry plantations and reserves and about 800 km
within the national parks. Road density is about 140 km per 1,000 sq km or



- 8 -
2.3 km per 1,000 inhabitants, which is above average for East African coun-
tries. The coverage of the network is adequate for the country's present
needs, but its standards and conditions are not satisfactory. Although some
improvement has been made, principally by upgrading roads to paved standard
(Table 2.2), low standard roads prevail, resulting in high transport costs.
Reflecting the general pattern of regional imbalance, 86% of the paved and
improved roads are located in the southern half of the country.

2.02      Some 1,590 km, or 55% of the main roads, connecting principal
cities and towns, are paved. During the last few years, construction of
paved roads has been concentrated on the 1,100 km north-south spine road,
the most important road in Malawi, running from Bangula in the deep south



to Karonga in the far north (see Map 1). When ongoing projects are completed
in 1981, some 940 km of that road will have been paved to a satisfactory
standard. The project would increase this length to about 1,010 km or some
92% of the road. Government has also started reconstruction of old, narrow
pavements; over 100 km of main roads were reconstructed during 1976/79,
and reconstruction of about 110 km of secondary roads is underway. Further
improvements of the secondary network are being prepared (para. 2.21), and
the long neglected district roads are also being improved under the first
phase of DRIMP (para. 1.18) while the Program-s second phase and preparation
of the third are included in the project (paras. 3.07 and 3.09).
B. Road Use
Vehicle Fleet
2.03      The composition and growth of the vehicle fleet is shown in Table
2.3. In 1978, the fleet (excluding motorcycles, farm tractors, trailers and
self-propelled, pneumatic-tired construction equipment) totalled just under
27,000 or 4.8 vehicles per 1,000 inhabitants, which is above average for
Eastern Africa but less than half of Kenya's vehicle ownership rate. The
fleet includes about 13,500 passenger cars, 300 buses and 13,100 goods
vehicles, with the balance made up of 4,200 motorcycles and 7,000 other
vehicles (mostly trailers). Reflecting the general pattern of economic
development to date (para. 1.03), 75% of all vehicles are registered in the
Southern Region. Over the period 1973-78, the total fleet grew at 9.0% p.a.
with the number of goods vehicles growing much faster than cars. One positive
development with regard to fuel efficiency is that motorcycles have become
a popular means of private transportation and have been growing at 10.1% p.a.
2.04      More than two-thirds of the goods vehicles have less than a 3-ton
carrying capacity, a large portion of which are 4-wheel drive vehicles. Only
3% of the goods vehicles, mainly owned by companies involved in international
movement of freight, have more than a 10-ton capacity, but the number of
trailers in Malawi has almost doubled in the last two years, and truck-trailer
combinations are common on the main routes. Ninety-seven percent of goods
vehicles over 3 tons have a relatively low average capacity of 7 tons, partly
because much of the internal freight is agricultural produce, and the load
factors and poor road conditions make the use of larger trucks uneconomic.

Traffic
2.05     There were no systematic traffic counts in Malawi until 1974 when,
following an agreement reached during negotiations of the Second Highway
Project, Government instituted a system of automatic counts supplemented by
periodic annual counts at a number of strategic points on the road network.
The counts are conducted by the Transport Unit of the National Statistical
office in Zomba, and a national traffic census has been published annually
since 1974. The census indicates that between 1974 and 1978 traffic increased
by about 7% p.a. However, the census should be used with caution, since
results of the automatic and periodic countings are often inconsistent,
indicating a need for improved counting operations. Traffic volumes on main
roads vary considerably between the south, where traffic is mostly in the
range of 200-600 vehicles per day (vpd) (although parts of the main north-
south road and the Lilongwe-Salima road have over 1,000 vpd), and the north
with far lower traffic levels, mostly in the 40-130 vpd range. Traffic
on secondary and selected district roads averages about 30 vpd. Overall
traffic on Malawi-s roads is lower than that in Kenya and comparable to that
in Zambia, where traffic on paved roads is about 400 vpd and on earth roads
about 20 vpd.
Road Transport
2.06     Over the past three years the number of licensed goods vehicles
has been increasing by 10% p.a. Altogether there were about 14,200 goods
vehicles licensed in Malawi in 1979, of which about 3,250 were Government
vehicles, 8,870 were for private use, and 2,080 were public (for hire) vehicles.
Little is known about vehicles owned by private companies, but statistics kept
on transport companies hiring out their vehicles show that about 470 companies
operate a fleet of 1,376 3-ton and over trucks and tankers. Over 60% of these
trucks are owned by small operators, and 34% by 9 large operators with over
30 vehicles each. The average size of the for-hire fleet operated by small
operators is 3 vehicles with an average capacity of 7 tons, compared to 9 tons
operated by the large companies.



- 11 -
2.07      Road transport licenses are awarded by the Road Traffic Commis-
sioner's Office within MTC, and are given for specific routes. In theory,
freight rates are regulated by MTC, and at present are a minimum of 9.63
tambala per ton-km for paved roads to a maximum of 13.98 tambala per ton-km
for earth and gravel roads; a rate of 9.63 tambala per ton-km for paved roads
and 12.60 tambala per ton-km for earth and gravel roads is set for ADMARC
cargo, the main agricultural marketing corporation. 1/ In practice it
appears that these rates serve more as maximum tariffs, since on most routes
competition among road transporters leads to charges lower than the regulated
rates. However, the setting of maximum rates is necessary since transporters
on a significant number of routes are in a monopoly situation. Government
tries to ensure that regulated maximum rates are kept at a reasonable level
by periodically revising rates, based on costs kept by one of the larger
companies, United Transport (Malawi), and research into vehicle operating
costs.
2.08      Road passenger services are provided by United Transport (Malawi),
and a few small local operators. Of the total fleet of 221 buses, 176 are
licensed for public service and these operate on over 150 routes, including
urban services. Fares are regulated by MTC, and actual fares generally seem
to be close to the regulated level.
Vehicle Regulations
2.09      Vehicle dimension and weight regulations are adequate (maximum
allowable axle load being nine tons), but enforcement by MTC-s Road Traffic
Commissioner's Office and the national police was generally lax up to 1976
when pavement failures noted at that time on the Lilongwe-Zomba road were
attributed to overweight Zambian trucks, then carrying considerable freight
to and from the railhead at Balaka. IDA missions thereafter emphasized the
importance of adequate enforcement, as required under the Credit Agreement
for the Second Highway Project. Government subsequently opened three weigh-
bridges installed at strategic points, and enforcement has improved consider-
ably. While the much reduced Zambian truck traffic now terminates at the new
railhead in Lilongwe and will mostly disappear when the railway line to the
Zambian border is completed in 1981, Malawian firms are increasingly using
large trucks on paved trunk roads. Strong enforcement of axle load limits
should therefore continue.
Road Safety
2.10      The toll of road accidents in Malawi is heavy and rapidly increasing.
Some road accident data, compiled from reports prepared by the Malawi Police
Force, are given in Table 2.4.
1/   Special rates apply to transport of fuel; these range from 11.25 to 13.75
tambala per ton-km.

2.11         The available  information on road accidents  suggests  some inconsis-
tencies between the numbers of accidents reported and the numbers which
actually occur. The most reliable of these statistics are those for fatali-
ties, but even these are likely to underrate the actual situation somewhat.
Some general conclusions can be inferred:
(a)   in relation  to population and road use,  the number  of
road fatalities in Malawi is about the norm for the
developing countries;
(b)   generally,  the rate of fatalities  per 1,000 vehicles
decreases with increased vehicle ownership (number of
vehicles per 10,000 inhabitants). In Malawi, however,



- 13 -
this trend has been reversed, particularly over the last two
years;
(c) between 1969 and 1979 road use has approximately doubled. Over
this period the number of vehicles reported to be involved in
accidents has increased by less than 50%. But the number of
road fatalities, a somewhat more reliable statistic, has
increased by 3-1/2 times; and
(d) the ratio of fatalities to injuries, normally 1:10 or
more in most developing countries, has increased rapidly
over the years; it was about 1 to 10 from 1967 to 1971,
increased to 1 to 8 during 1977 and to 1 to 4 during
1978 and 1979.
2.12      The rapid increase in the rate of fatal accidents over the last
two years is probably due to the rapidly increasing length of the bituminized
road system. This is of considerable concern to Government, which is plan-
ning to address the problem by improved education and enforcement of regula-
tions as well as identification of "black spots" (short sections of road
with high accident occurrence) and the improvement of roads in these areas.
2.13      Road use and traffic regulations are contained in the Road Traffic
Act of 1969, with several amendments and expansions of the Act having been
made over the years. The Act contains the usual regulations on vehicle sizes
and axle loads, speed limits, driving instruction schools and licences,
insurance, road service permits, regular inspection and testing. Licensing
and vehicle inspection, annually for all goods vehicles over 3 tons and for
all other vehicles over 10 years old, are the responsibility of MTC's Road
Traffic Commissioner's Office; enforcement of traffic regulations is the
responsibility of the Police Force's Traffic Section who patrol trunk roads,
but lack capacity for strict enforcement.
2.14      Government established a National Road Safety Council (NRSC) in
1978 to coordinate road safety measures and activities at the national level.
Members of NRSC are drawn from the Ministries of Transport and Communications,
Trade, Industry and Tourism, Health, Justice, Education and Works and Supplies
as well as from non-governmental organizations. Funds allocated to NRSC have
been limited, and its activities to date have mainly consisted of twice
weekly radio broadcasts on road safety. The Council is planning increased
propaganda activities, e.g., seminars and film shows as well as the introduc-
tion of traffic education in primary and secondary schools. During supervi-
sion of the project, the Association will monitor the situation and maintain
a dialogue with Government. If proposed measures do not produce adequate
results, we would seek to define more clearly how IDA resources can be use-
fully employed in future projects to assist the Government in reducing the
toll of road accidents.
Road User Revenue
2.15      Road users contribute to Government revenue through taxes and
duties on fuel, lubricants, vehicles and spare parts, and through license
and registration fees. The pump price of petrol is 70.7 tambala per liter



- 14 -
and of diesel, 64.0 tambala per liter; equivalent import prices are 38.0
tambala and 35.6 tambala, respectively. The normal duty on petrol is 5
tambala per liter and on diesel, 2 tambala per liter; however, in 1979 during
a period of fuel shortages in Malawi, an additional fuel levy of 14 tambala
per liter was imposed on petrol and diesel, and this levy is still in force
although the supply of fuel is back to normal. Duties on vehicles range from
5% for buses and trucks up to 40% for high value cars. There is a 24% surtax
on fuel and 18% on all vehicles except buses and trucks over 3 tons. Total
revenue from road users in 1978 is estimated at about US$15 million. Present
expenditures on administering and maintaining the road network, including the
costs of the Road Traffic Commissioner's Office, amount to less than US$3.5
million. Thus, in addition to covering maintenance expenditures and long-term
marginal costs, including expected increases (para. 2.28), road user revenues
make a significant contribution to the capital costs of the network.
C. Administration and Training
2.16      MWS is responsible for all classified roads except district roads,
which are the responsibility of the District Councils. MWS is also gradually
taking over responsibility for maintenance of 2,000 km of feeder roads being
constructed under several agricultural development projects; these roads are
expected to become the districts responsibility as the District Councils gain
sufficient road maintenance capacity. The Ministry of Agriculture and National
Resources is responsible for the 1,600 km of forestry and national park roads
and tracks. No authority is responsible for the undetermined length of un-
classified earth tracks (para. 2.01), but the most important of these tracks
are expected to be classified as district roads over the next few years. MWS
is organized according to its three functions (see Chart 1): administration
is carried out by well-staffed departments for administration, finance,
personnel, stores and auditing; engineering is done by departments for design,
building and roads; and development, the most recently established department,
still has rather vague responsibilities but will increasingly be concerned
with planning. Road planning and overall supervision are handled by the
headquarters staff at Lilongwe. MWS has divisional offices in each of the
three regions, which are directly responsible for field operations for roads
and other works. In addition, these regional offices have 4 branch offices,
14 district depots and 48 subdistrict depots for road maintenance. The
Ministry has a Plant and Vehicle Hire Organization (PVHO) with workshops in
all regions and most districts and a central workshop in Blantyre for major
repairs.
2.17      MWS has some 60 professional staff and about 100 subprofessional
and supervisory staff; its Roads Department has 11 civil engineers and one
transport economist. The Ministry has in the past been administered by
senior expatriate staff who are gradually being replaced by Malawians as
they acquire the education and experience needed. While the present salaried
staff of about 1,200 includes 105 expatriates (in 1977 these numbered 135 and
in 1982 the number is expected to be 85), of the 8 most senior posts filled by
expatriates in 1977, 5 are now filled by well qualified Malawians; 4 of the



- 15 -
Roads Department's 12 professionals are expatriates. While the rate of
localization has been slow, it has ensured the long-standing high standard
of efficiency of all departments of MWS. However, qualified Malawians are
still needed to replace expatriates and to handle the expanded activities of
MWS. The Roads Department has recently increased its number of posts for
professionals to 25, in preparation for increased emphasis on road maintenance
and planning; the new posts are expected to be filled by Malawians graduating
from the Malawi Polytechnic during the next few years or temporarily by
expatriates.
2.18      Although all of the 24 District Councils have a road foreman on
their staffs and a few have a core of road employees, their administration
for road improvement and maintenance has been very weak. DRIMP was designed
to overcome this problem by providing for the establishment of an organiza-
tional framework, training of key staff, and the provision of facilities.
The concept was successfully tested under a pilot scheme in Kasungu District
(para. 2.29) where the maintenance organization is now fully operational and
has been handed over to the District Council.
Z.19      The Government has an active program for selecting, educating and
training nationals for professional positions, but the program has still not
met the demand for qualified personnel, mainly because of the scarcity of
qualified candidates. Training abroad is provided with external assistance,
mainly from the U.K., the European Economic Community (EEC) and the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP). During 1978 about 220 trainees in
all categories returned to Malawi, 25 with professional degrees and 30 from
post-graduate training; at the end of 1978 about 600 Malawians were studying
overseas, 65 for professional degrees and 95 in post-graduate courses.
Opportunities for training overseas are sufficient for the number of suitably
qualified candidates, and as the Malawi Polytechnic develops its capacity
in the technical fields, the need for overseas training of engineers will
gradually diminish except for post-graduate courses. Good progress has also
been made in training lower echelon personnel, such as road supervisors,
foremen, equipment operators and mechanics, at the Ministry's fully localized
Training Branch in Zomba (for details, see Annex 2). While the training
program, the quality of training, and the availability of staff to be trained
are adequate, the capacity of the Training Branch is now fully utilized. MWS
has concluded that the training center should be relocated in Lilongwe
because expansion possibilities of the existing center in Zomba are limited
and because, subsequent to relocation of MWS's headquarters to Lilongwe,
continuous supervision of training activities and the use of MWS's profes-
sionals as part-time instructors is impractical and very costly. Relocation
would also permit the use of existing facilities (design and surveying
divisions, materials and soils laboratory) in Lilongwe for training purposes.
Relocation of the center is planned in several steps, starting with the
establishment of facilities for training of road construction and maintenance
personnel. The project will assist in financing facilities (class-
rooms, dormitories, staff housing, teaching aids and equipment) required for
the training of about 50 Roads Department staff annually, i.e., 25 trainees
for each 6-month training course, which is more than twice the number now
being trained (para. 3.10).

D. Planning and Financing
2.20      As stated in para. 1.16, MWS is responsible for road planning but
has limited capacity for this function. All major projects are, however,
preceded by feasibility studies carried out by-consultants. Government's
need for assistance in transport planning, including that for roads, will be
addressed under the proposed project by the provision of technical assistance
and training (para. 3.09).
2.21      A summary of current and planned road projects is presented in Table
2.5. Reflecting Government s general strategy of promoting development in
the Central and Northern Regions, over 80% of the projects listed are in those
regions. Main road projects, accounting for 55% of current and planned road
expenditure, are mainly devoted to improvement of the north-south and lakeshore
roads, and roads linking Malawi to Mozambique and Zambia. Road improvements
will also be carried out under DRIMP (for district roads), a small Key Rural
Road Program (for all classes of roads), and a proposed Upgrading of Secondary
Roads Program. The latter, probably to be financed by the Canadian Government,
will require a study of the secondary road system, which will assess the
condition of the existing system, determine present and future traffic demand,
estimate costs of improvement and maintenance, and determine which secondary
roads will be economically justified for improvement. The study is expected
to begin in mid-1981 and should be completed by early 1982.
2.22      As mentioned earlier (para. 1.15), the transport plan is probably
over-ambitious. Although economic analysis for many of the proposed new
projects has not yet been completed, it already appears that a significant
number of the projects may be found marginal. If the plan is cut back, as
seems likely, any marginal projects should be delayed in favor of others found
more justified.
2.23      Highway expenditures are financed from the general budget or, for
new construction, from the development account which is largely made up of
grants and credits from bilateral and multilateral aid programs. Expenditures
on construction have averaged about US$19.0 million equivalent annually over
the past four years, while MWS's maintenance expenditures have averaged US$2.2
million (Table 2.6). Maintenance funds were adequate in the past but are now
insufficient to maintain the aging network (para. 2.28). They will be
increased in the future (para. 3.09 (v)).

E. Engineering
2.24      The Design Department of MWS is staffed by 12 civil engineers and
25 technicians and surveyors. The Department has a well-equipped laboratory
for materials and soils testing and is primarily engaged in design of
structures; it carries out preliminary investigations and road and bridge
designs, but engineering for major road projects is done by consultants.
The design standards adopted by the MWS (Annex 3) are appropriate for the
country's topographic and traffic conditions.
F. Construction
2.25      For major road projects, the Roads Department employs contractors,
following suitable prequalification and tendering procedures; contracts are
generally let on a unit-price basis. In recent years, the Roads Department
has undertaken several force account road construction projects (about US$3
million equivalent annually); the performance of the units has been satis-
factory. Labor-intensive methods are employed for construction of culverts,
drains and structural excavation, and are being increasingly used in the
improvement and maintenance of district roads (para. 2.29).
2.26      The developing domestic contracting industry is fully employed on
buildings, small structures, estate and other minor roads, as well as resealing



- 19 -
of short sections of main roads and of runways of minor airfields. Domestic
contractors lack the capacity for major road works, which are undertaken by
foreign contractors who have shown considerable interest in working in Malawi.
Private Malawian firms have lately been acquiring holdings (up to 49%) in
local branches of foreign contracting firms. Senior domestic contractor
personnel are largely drawn from MWS, whose training facilities (para. 2.19)
therefore perform a useful function in indirectly training contractor personnel.
Construction supervision is carried out by the Roads Department or by consult-
ing engineers acting as its representatives. Supervision is satisfactory and
payment procedures are prompt, and, in general, the experience of MWS in
dealing with contractors has been satisfactory.
G. Maintenance
2.27      The Regional Divisions of the MWS are responsible for maintaining
the classified road system with the exception of district roads. Each of
the regions has a well trained cadre of maintenance personnel. Maintenance
operations are largely mechanized, although extensive use is made of labor for
routine maintenance. The Roads Department rents equipment from the Plant and
Vehicle Hire Organization (also under MWS), which is responsible for procuring
and maintaining all Government-owned equipment and vehicles; rental rates are
based on the cost of purchasing and maintaining the equipment. Equipment
availability and utilization rates are satisfactory.
2.28      Until a few years ago maintenance of main and secondary roads in
Malawi was fairly good, much better than in most other East African countries.
However, while the funds allocated to MWS for recurrent road maintenance
have increased by about 10% annually, the current high inflation rate and
the rapid increases in the length of the improved network have now caused
the funds to be barely sufficient for routine maintenance. Periodic main-
tenance will soon be needed for gravel roads and for about 1,000 km of roads
paved in 1970-77; after about 1985 another 1,000 km, paved in 1978-83, will
also require periodic maintenance. The problem will soon be compounded by a
shortage of staff, especially at the road technician, mechanic and operator
levels. The project therefore includes a comprehensive study of maintenance
needs, and the technical, financial and manpower resources required to meet
those needs (para. 3.09). The study would be coordinated with related efforts
by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) (para. 2.21) and other
donors. The project also includes some funds to procure equipment for minor
repairs of bituminous pavements and to start building a new training center in
Lilongwe to facilitate expansion of training of road construction and main-
tenance personnel (para. 3.10).
2.29      Although Government has traditionally supplemented the District
Councils limited funds for recurrent maintenance by providing an annual light
grading to the most important district roads, the major portion of the district
roads network was neglected prior to the start of DRIMP in 1974, under the
IDA-financed Second Highway Project. Under an initial pilot project in the



- 20 -
Kasungu District, an improvement and maintenance unit was established which
assumed responsibility for all maintenance operations of the Kasungu District
Council and trained its roads staff as well as road foremen from all 24
districts. The pilot scheme was successful and was subsequently extended
to three additional districts. This ongoing first phase of DRIMP, also
financed under the Second Highway Project, includes the establishment of
maintenance units in each district, improvement of about 1,100 km of district
roads to a maintainable but minimum all-weather standard, and the training of
key District Council staff both on-the-job and at the Zomba training center.
It also includes the establishment of three improvement units equipped with
heavy graders, which will supplement the maintenance units in each district
during the improvement phase. Improvement works are mostly carried out by
intermediate technology but labor-intensive methods have been used on a 50 km
demonstration project and have proved successful. They will be used in-
creasingly as far as is economically and practically feasible. The project
would help finance the second phase of DRIMP, extending the program to ten
additional districts and improving another 2,600 km of roads (para. 3.07).
2.30      The establishment of DRIMP and the improvement works are being
implemented by MWS with some assistance from consultants because of MWS's
staff constraints. When this phase is completed the facilities and trained
staff will be turned over to the District Councils so that they can improve
their maintenance operations, which will be mostly labor-intensive. Recurrent
maintenance costs will have to be supplemented by the Government as District
Councils revenues are very limited. The proposed project, however, will
assist Government in this respect by providing financing on a declining basis
for the incremental portion of the recurrent maintenance costs during the
project period (para. 3.08).
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The main objectives of the project are to assist the Government in
(a) its general strategy of developing the economic potential of the northern
half of the country, particularly the Mzimba, Viphya and Mzuzu areas, which
are the centers of recently initiated and planned rural development projects;
(b) achieving a balanced pattern of economic and social growth by providing
for improvements and maintenance of district roads; and (c) promoting mainten-
ance of the main and secondary road networks. More specifically, the project
aims at:
(a)  continuing the upgrading of sections of the country-s most
important road to paved standard;
(b)  making a start in redressing the country's deteriorating road
maintenance performance;
(c)  extending DRIMP which was initiated under the Second Highway
Project; and
(d)  strengthening the transport planning capacity of EPD.



- 21 -
B. Project Description
3.02      The project consists of:
(a)  construction of a two-lane bituminous-paved road between
Jenda and Luwawa Turnoff (32.2 km), and between Mbowe and
Ekwendeni (37.2 km);
(b)  improvement of the existing road between Luwawa Turnoff
and Mbowe (100 km) to a low gravel standard to permit
regular maintenance;
(c)  the second phase of DRIMP;
(d)  consulting services, and training where required, for:
(i)  supervision of (a) and (b) above;
(ii)  assistance to MWS in preparing and carrying out
(c) above;
(iii)  assistance to MWS in preparing the third phase of
DRIMP;
(iv)  assistance to strengthen EPD's transport planning
unit; and
(v)  a study of road maintenance needs and the capacity
and resources of MWS and the District Councils to
meet maintenance requirements;
(e)  provision of road maintenance equipment to MWS's Roads
Department; and
(f)  facilities for the first phase of MWS's new training
center in Lilongwe.
(a)  Road Construction
3.03      The road construction component comprises two sections of the
country-s main north-south road which will ultimately link the Northern
Region with the more developed Central and Southern Regions. The road has,
during recent years, been constructed from the south with IDA financing under
the First, Second and Third Highway Projects (about 500 km from Zomba through
Lilongwe and Kasungu to Jenda), and from the north with financing from the
EDF, the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the African Development Fund
(AfDF) (about 210 km from Karonga through Chiweta and Rumphi to Ekwendeni).
Construction of the two sections under the project would leave only about 100
km of unpaved road out of a total distance of about 1,100 km between Bangula
in the deep south and Karonga in the far north. Drainage on the existing road
is poor, resulting in road closures during the rainy season, and the surface
is very rough and costly to maintain under present conditions.



- 22 -
3.04      The alternative of upgrading the road to an engineered gravel
standard was considered but was not found technically or economically feasible
because of the steep slopes and scarcity of naturally available gravels in the
area.
3.05      Detailed engineering for the road construction was carried out
by the Malawi Branch of Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick and Partners (U.K.) and is
satisfactory. The geometric and structural design standards (Annex 3) are
consistent with established standards in Malawi and are appropriate for the
terrain and forecast traffic. They are generally based on a design speed of
50 m.p.h. (80 km p.h.) and a maximum gradient of 6.5%. The pavement structure
will be a crushed stone basecourse with a double 6.7 m wide bituminous surface
treatment and a 1.5 m wide shoulder on each side.
(b) Road Improvements
3.06      Paving of the remaining 100 km of road section from Luwawa Turnoff
to Mbowe is not recommended at this stage because for the most part it would
not be economically justified (see para. 4.10). However, Government is
currently studying the possibility of developing the wood resources of the
Viphya forest, and for the scope of development likely to be feasible in the
area, considerable upgrading of the road, in tandem with intensive subsequent
maintenance, would be needed for it to withstand the effects of the forecast
traffic over the next few years, until full reconstruction becomes viable.
The project will therefore finance improvement of the Luwawa Turnoff-Kalungulu
(42.5 km) and Champhoya-Mbowe (47 km) road sections to a low- all-weather
gravel standard by widening of narrow sections, highly improved drainage
(including new culverting), reshaping of formation and a 15 cm gravel surface.
The Kalungulu-Champhoya section (10.5 km) is already in acceptable condition
and would need only to be gravelled. This would facilitate the carrying out
of routine maintenance and intensive grading over the next few years of
forecast traffic.
(c) Second Phase of DRIMP
3.07      The project would extend the ongoing first phase of DRIMP to ten
additional districts that have already been agreed with the Government.
Selection of roads for improvement and planning for the maintenance units in
these districts were carried out by Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick and Partners.
Facilities to be provided and a list of roads to be improved during the first
year of the project have been agreed with the Government; the work program for
subsequent years will be agreed not later than four months before the beginning
of each fiscal year until completion of this project component (para. 5.01(a)).
The project would provide for the establishment of maintenance units in each
district including a depot, housing for key staff and light equipment (Annex
4). It would also provide for improvement of about 2,600 km of district roads
under the jurisdiction of the District Councils in those ten districts;
lists of roads to be improved are given in Annex 5. Improvement works would
be carried out by the three existing improvement units established under
Phase I and the ten maintenance units to be established under the proposed
second phase of DRIMP.



- 23 -
Implementation of the second phase should start immediately following comple-
tion of the first phase in mid-1981. In order to avoid disruptions in
implementing road improvements, construction of depots and housing for key
staff in the first three districts of the second phase should be completed at
that time. As the construction, carried out by local contractors or, if
tendering is unsuccessful, by force account, has a long lead time and the
construction period is about 8-12 months, it is proposed that payments since,
July 1, 1980, for the construction of depots and housing in the first three
districts of DRIMP's second phase, be financed retroactively under the
Project up to a maximum of US$350,000.
3.08      Maintenance of the district roads, subsequent to improvements,
will be undertaken by the District Councils using the facilities provided,
and staff trained, under the project. While Government has provided the
District Councils with some assistance for recurrent maintenance (para. 2.29),
regular maintenance of the improved network will require substantial and
increasing Government assistance. The Government has agreed to assist the
District Councils by providing grants to supplement the Councils revenues
available for road maintenance, in amounts sufficient to bring the total up to
the recurrent maintenance cost for each district as annually assessed by MWS.
Government disbursements would be tied to output which in turn requires
supervision by MWSs regional offices.  Because of the country's difficult
economic situation and because Government will concurrently need to increase
its allocations for recurrent maintenance of main and secondary roads, it is
proposed that during the project period the Credit would provide financing on
a declining basis for the incremental portion of the recurrent maintenance
costs of roads to be improved under DRIMP. The system of Government assis-
tance, and the allocations needed during the project period have been agreed
with Government (Annex 6); appropriateness of allocations will be discussed
annually by Government and IDA on the basis of MWS's updated estimates of the
funds required by the District councils (para. 5.01 (b)).
(d) Consulting Services and Training
3.09      The project provides consulting services, and training where necessary,
for the following purposes:
(i) supervision of construction of the Jenda-Luwawa Turnoff
and the Mbowe-Ekwendeni road sections and of improvement
of the Luwawa Turnoff-Mbowe section;
(ii) technical assistance in planning for and implementing the
second phase of DRIMP, the establishment of the maintenance
units, the training of local staff, the road improvements
and the subsequent maintenance, since MWS lacks sufficient
staff for this purpose (para. 2.30). In order for the
second phase to start immediately following completion of
the first phase in mid-1981, Government has financed the
preparation of the second phase, carried out by the



- 24 -
consultants Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick and Partners, who also
prepared the first phase and are providing technical assistance
for its implementation. It is, therefore, proposed that pay-
ments since July 1, 1980 for the preparation of the second
phase be financed retroactively under the project up to a
maximum of US$230,000;
(iii)  technical assistance in planning for and preparing the third
phase of DRIMP since MWC lacks sufficient staff for this
purpose (para. 2.30);
(iv) technical assistance to strengthen EPD's transport planning unit
with one transport planner for about three years and overseas
training in transport planning of about three local staff for
approximately two years. Terms of reference for the transport
planner are given in Annex 7. An agreement has been reached with
Government that by December 31, 1981, a transport economist will be
appointed with qualifications and experience and under terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Association. It has also been agreed
that by June 1, 1981, Government will select the first of about
three candidates for overseas training and the remaining ones by
December 31, 1981; the trainees qualifications and the proposed
training program will be satisfactory to the Association (para. 5.01
(c));
(v) in preparation for expanded maintenance operations, a comprehen-
sive study of the maintenance needs of all road classes, and of
the capacity of MWS and the District Councils to meet mainte-
nance requirements on a continuing basis. The study would make
specific recommendations covering an initial five-year period,
including the expansion of facilities (depots, equipment, etc.),
manpower requirements at all levels, and the funding needs for
recurrent maintenance. Terms of reference for the study are given
in Annex 8 and have been agreed with Government. Agreement has also
been reached with Government: (1) on maintenance allocations for
the next two years, which will be increased in real terms by 10%
each year (a total of 21%); (2) that Government will exchange views
with the Association on the findings and recommendations of the
maintenance study, which is to be completed by May 31, 1982; (3)
that Government will establish a rolling 5-year maintenance program
satisfactory to the Association to implement the recommendations of
the study; and (4) that thereafter, not later than four months
before the beginning of each fiscal year until five years after
completion of the project, Government will exchange views with the
Association on the 5-year rolling program, including each year's
maintenance works and allocations (para. 5.01(d)).
(e) and (f) Maintenance Equipment and Training Center Facilities
3.10      While any large-scale effort to strengthen MWS's maintenance depart-
ment must await the conclusion of the maintenance study, the proposed project
would begin to correct the country's deteriorating road maintenance perform-
ance by providing for (i) equipment to complement and expand existing plant
for minor repair of bituminous pavements; it has been agreed with Government

that the following equipment would be procured under the project (para.
5.01(e)): 3 bitumen minibatch mixers/spreaders, 3 vibrating rollers (hand),
3 small bitumen heaters and 3 pick-up vehicles (1-1/2 tons); and (ii) the
first phase of MWS's new training center in Lilongwe; facilities (classrooms
and dormitories for 25 trainees, staff housing) to be provided to the center
have been agreed with Government (Annex 2, Attachment 1) (para. 5.01(f)).
C. Cost Estimates
3.11      The total project cost including contingencies is currently esti-
mated at US$42.2 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$26.7 million
or 63% of total project costs. Excluding taxes and duties, the total cost is
about US$39.2 million. Details are provided in Table 3.1.
3.12      The base costs are estimated as of mid-1980 and have been derived
as follows:
(a)  Road Construction:  The cost estimates for construction of the
Jenda-Luwawa Turnoff and the Mbowe-Ekwendeni road sections, to be
carried out in 1981/82, were derived from consultants' estimates
based on final design quantities.  Estimated costs average
between US$200,000 and US$250,000 per km which appear reasonable
in the light of bids recently received for similar works. In a
detailed analysis, the consultants estimate the foreign exchange
component of construction at 70% of total costs. This component
includes depreciation of equipment, imported materials, fuel,
spare parts, the foreign expense of expatriate personnel, over-
head costs and profits. The local component mainly comprises
labor and taxes.
(b)  Road Improvements:  The cost of improvements for the Luwawa
Turnoff-Mbowe road section, to be carried out in 1982, is
derived from consultants' estimates based on a road inventory.
Estimated costs average about US$40,000 per km.
(c)  DRIMP:  The costs of establishing the maintenance units and of
improvement works and subsequent maintenance are based on actual
costs incurred for such units under DRIMP's first phase. The
implementation period would extend from mid-1981 to about mid-
1984.
(d)  Consulting Services:  The supervision of construction and improve-
ments will require about 130 man-months of consulting services;
the technical assistance for preparation and implementation of
DRIMP's second phase will require about 90 man-months; technical
assistance for preparation of DRIMP's third phase, about 15
man-months; technical assistance to strengthen EPD's transport
planning unit, about 30 man-months; and the maintenance study,
about 55 man-months. Estimated total costs are US$1,270,000,



- 27 -
US$1,150,000, US$250,000, US$300,000, and US$630,000, respectively.
The average man-month cost, including salary, costs, fees, inter-
national travel and subsistence is estimated at about US$8,200
for the construction supervision, US$9,000 for the technical
assistance to DRIMP-s second phase, US$10,000 for the technical
assistance to prepare DRIMP's third phase, and US$9,500 for the
technical assistance to EPD and for the maintenance study;
these costs are in line with recent experience in Malawi. In
addition to these personnel costs, the contract costs include
the costs of local transportation, local office operating
expenses, printing of reports and some other minor expenses.
The estimated costs for the maintenance study, which should be
completed by mid-1982, also include the cost of equipment for
pavement roughness and strength evaluation.
(e) Assistance to MWS Maintenance Operations: Cost of equipment was
assessed at US$140,000, on the basis of existing market prices in
Malawi. The cost of MWS's new training center was estimated by MWS
on the basis of current prices in Malawi.
D. Financing
3.13      The project cost net of taxes and duties is US$39.2 million.  The
IDA Credit of SDR 25.9 million (about US$33.0 million equivalent) will finance
100% of the foreign cost and about 51% of the local cost (about 84% of the
total cost net of taxes and duties) of the project. Government will finance
the remaining US$6.2 million (about 16% of total cost net of taxes and duties).
E. Implementation and Procurement
3.14      MWS will be responsible for project execution apart from the tech-
nical assistance for transport planning, for which EPD will be responsible.
Road construction and improvements totalling about US$21.0 million, will be
executed under two unit price contracts awarded after international competi-
tive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
3.15      Because of the small scope and scattered location of works, the
depots and housing for the second phase of DRIMP and MWS's new training
center, totalling about US$2.5 million, will be constructed by local con-
tractors, following local competitive bidding procedures satisfactory to
the Association or, if this proves unsuccessful, by force account as under
DRIMP's first phase. In order to train local staff in the ten districts,
improvement and maintenance works under DRIMP's second phase, amounting to a
total of US$4.5 million, will be by force account, with consultants providing
technical assistance in line with experience under the Program's first phase.
3.16      Supervision of road construction and improvements, as well as
technical assistance for the second phase of DRIMP, the preparation of



- 28 -
DRIMP's third phase, the technical assistance to EPD's transport planning
unit, and the carrying out of the maintenance study will be by consultants
employed under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association at a
total cost of about US$3.7 million; this has been agreed with Government
(para. 5.01(g)).
3.17      In view of the diversity of types and the few numbers of each type
of equipment for maintenance of bituminous pavements, costing a total of about
US$140,000, procurement of these items will be through local shopping. To
maintain standardization and interchangeability between districts as well as
with MWS's PVH0, which will undertake repairs and overhauls, equipment for the
districts' maintenance units, costing a total of about US$940,000 (including
about US$190,000 for equipment to strengthen the existing improvement units)
would be purchased either from manufacturers supplying equipment for the first
phase of DRIMP, by extending existing contracts if still in effect at the time
of Credit signing, or by local shopping.
3.18      An implementation schedule is presented in Chart 2, the details
of which have been agreed with Government (para. 5.01 (h)).
F. Disbursements
3.19      The Credit funds would be disbursed on the following basis:
(a) 80% of total expenditures for construction and improvements
on the Jenda-Ekwendeni road;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local expenditures
for equipment, vehicles and spare parts;
(c) 70% of expenditures on civil works (depots and housing) for DRIMP's
second phase and on civil works for MWS's new training center;
(d) 60% of expenditures on civil works for district roads' improve-
ments under DRIMP's second phase;
(e) 85% of total expenditures for consultants' services;
(f) for incremental maintenance expenditures on district roads:
for each district being brought into the maintenance program,
subsequent to completion of road improvements, 75% of incre-
mental costs during the first year of maintenance; 50%
during the second year of maintenance; and 25% during the
third year of maintenance; and
(g) 100% of foreign expenditures for overseas training of EPD staff.
It is recommended that IDA finance retroactively up to US$350,000 to meet 70%
of total costs of depots and housing for the first three districts of DRIMP-s



- 29 -
second phase (para. 3.07) and up to US$230,000 to meet the foreign exchange
component of consultants' fees for the preparation of DRIMP's second phase
(para. 3.09 (ii)). IDA financing of the incremental total cost of maintenance,
declining from 75% for the first year of maintenance to 50% for the second
year and 25% fozr the third year, would be matched to Government's financial
assistance to the District Councils in accordance with targets agreed with
Government (para. 5.01(b)).
3.20      All disbursements will be fully documented except for expenditures
under force account for civil works included in Parts c and f of Table 3.1
which will be made against certificates of work performed, to be issued by
the technical assistance consultants. The documents supporting these state-
ments of expenditure will not be submitted for review but will be retained
by MWS for inspection by the Association during project supervision missions.
3.21      An estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Table 3.2.

G. Accounting, Auditing and Reporting Requirements
3.22      Project accounts, including statements of expenditures, will be
maintained by MWS with separate accounts for each component. In previous
IDA projects, accounts have been audited by the Auditor General; as this
arrangement has proved satisfactory, it would also be followed for the
proposed project. Government has agreed that all project accounts will be
audited by the Auditor General and that the audited accounts together with the
auditors' report will be submitted to IDA not later than six months after the
end of the fiscal year (para. 5.01(i)). Government has also agreed on progress
reporting requirements (Annex 9), which should include indices for measuring
implementation, and the submission of a project completion report, in a form
satisfactory to the Association, not later than six months after the closing
date (para. 5.01(h)).
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Evaluation of Project Components
General
4.01      The Government of Malawi's Statement of Development Policies (1971)
lists the following as main socioeconomic objectives:  (a) rural development;
(b) increasing real GDP through the development of smallholder output, estate
agriculture and industry; and (c) promoting development of its Northern Region
which had heretofore been isolated from the rest of the country. The proposed
project continues the work done under previous IDA projects to assist Govern-
ment in attaining these objectives. The project includes upgrading of the
Jenda-Mzuzu-Ekwendeni road (169 km), part to paved standard (69.4 km) and part
to all-weather gravel standard (100 km); this would only leave unpaved 100 km
of the 1,100 km north-south spine road linking the Northern Region with the
railway and population centers to the south. In addition, the road sections
to be constructed and improved under the project would support Government-s
specific development goals for the Mzimba, Viphya and Mzuzu areas, which are
the centers of recently initiated or planned rural development projects. At
present, access to the north is provided only by air, lake transport and
low-standard earth roads. The project component to help improve and maintain
the district road network will support rural development efforts by facilitat-
ing the provision of agricultural inputs and extension services, and allowing
the expansion of distribution and marketing systems. Finally, the project-s
maintenance component, which will lay the groundwork for improving Government s
highway maintenance organization and execution of works, is a necessary
adjunct to all three of the development goals mentioned above.
4.02      The construction and improvement of the road is justified and
expected to yield an economic return (ER) of about 19%. District roads



- 31 -
to be improved under the project are selected in accordance with socio-
economic criteria and have a rate of return of at least 12%. No ER has
been calculated for the maintenance study and equipment provided under the
project, although if implemented, the study-s recommendations are expected to
result in substantial benefits deriving from Government-s increased capacity
to maintain the road network.
1.   Upgrading of the Jenda-Mzuzu-Ekwendeni Road (169 km)
(a) Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.03      The main project benefits from these works are related to reduced
vehicle operating and maintenance costs. Benefits deriving from the impact of
the road on the north in terms of increased agricultural production have only
partially been allowed for in estimates of generated traffic in the economic
analysis. Benefits from accident reduction have not been included in the
computation of the economic returns.
4.04      In the first instance, the major beneficiaries of transport cost
reductions will be the local truck owners and operators. However, in view of
the competitive nature of the road transport industry (para. 2.07) and the
fact that Government-prescribed rates, when observed, take account of road
conditions, it can be expected that the savings in operating costs and time
will be passed on in the form of lower freight rates to the farmers and other
shippers in the zone of road influence.  Consumers are also expected to
benefit from reduced transport costs, particularly those living in the north
where prices are substantially higher than in the south, partly because of
transport costs.
(b) Area of Influence of the Project Road
4.05      The Jenda-Mzuzu-Ekwendeni road forms part of the Bangula-Karonga
highway, the backbone of the country's road network. The main road will have
national importance by serving to unify the entire country and will eventually
form part of an international route to Dar es Salaam via Karonga-Chitipa-
Tunduma. The Mbowe-Ekwendeni section to be constructed under the project will
run through Mzuzu, the administrative and commercial center for the whole
Northern Region, while the Jenda-Mbowe road section will serve the Mzimba and
Viphya areas, which are now either being developed or are planned for develop-
ment. Furthermore, the road will provide an outlet for feeder roads carrying
cash crops for export, as well as production from estate and smallholder
farming.
4.06      A number of development projects have already started within the
project road's direct and indirect zone of influence. The Association is
involved in two of these projects: the Second Karonga Rural Development
Project and a Wood Energy Project to help establish forestry plantation
and farmers- woodlots in the districts of Karonga, Chitipa, Mzimba and
Rumphi. Tobacco, rice and tea cultivation schemes would also be indirectly
served by the road. In addition, Government is presently studying the



- 32 -
possibilities for developing the Viphya forest; consultants financed by the
Overseas Development Administration (ODA) and KfW are studying various wood
processing industries for sawed wood, particle boards, block wood, wood-
based energy products, and pulp and paper products. The economic analysis
does not take into account the traffic which will be generated by such
industries (probably to be situated near the project road), as there are
currently no firm plans to develop the wood resources. However, when the
plans are finalized and the wood-processing industries established, the
economic justification for paving the remaining unpaved sections of the
project road should be evaluated, given the substantial benefits expected
from savings in vehicle operating and maintenance costs which will arise
from the traffic generated by the wood-processing industries.
(c) Economic Analysis
(i) Traffic
4.07      Traffic on the road is assumed to grow at 7% p.a. in accordance
with recent traffic count (Table 4.1). By 1983, when construction of the road
is completed, traffic will vary from 83 vpd on the Luwawa Turnoff-Kalungulu
section to 395 vpd on the Mzuzu-Ekwendeni section; this includes normal and
diverted traffic, plus traffic generated from agricultural projects at the
northern and southern ends of the road. Generated traffic equivalent to
10% of the 1983 traffic level has also been included in the evaluation of
the paved road sections (Jenda-Luwawa Turnoff and Mbowe-Ekwendeni).

(ii) Vehicle Operating Costs
4.08      Vehicle operating costs (voc) for the road section to be gravelled
(Luwawa Turnoff-Mbowe) were estimated by IDA staff while voc for other road
sections were determined by the Highway Design and Maintenance Model (HDM).
According to the HDM model, voc will increase significantly on earth (as
well as gravel) roads as traffic increases, particularly when traffic exceeds
100 vpd. This occurs even with a modest increase in maintenance expenditures
since the roads were not originally designed and constructed for a high level
of traffic. Table 4.2 gives voc for representative vehicles on roads carrying
about 115 vpd.

(iii) Costs of Construction, Improvement and Maintenance
4.09      Annex 10 shows cost estimates of the road construction and improve-
ment; these are net of taxes at mid-1980 prices and include the cost of
supervision and physical contingencies of 10%. Costs for the Jenda-Luwawa
Turnoff, Mbowe-Mzuzu and Mzuzu-Ekwendeni sections cover construction of
the road to paved standard, to be built by contract. Improvement costs of
the Luwawa Turnoff-Kalungulu and Champhoya-Mbowe sections include costs for
widening the road, improving the drainage, and gravelling. Costs for the
Kalungulu-Champhoya section only include gravelling as this road is in
acceptable condition.
(iv) Economic Return
4.10      Economic analysis of the abovementioned costs and benefits shows
that upgrading of the Jenda-Mzuzu-Ekwendeni road is well justified. The
overall economic return is estimated at 19% under the traffic growth estimate.
A separate analysis has also been carried out for each section of the road.
On the three road sections to be improved to paved standard the ER ranges
from 13% to 30% (Table 4.3), while the three sections to be improved to



- 34 -
gravel standard show rates of return between 11% and 55%. Details of the
economic evaluation are given in Annex 10. The sections to be paved were
also considered for improvement to engineered gravel standard, but this was
not found justified due to the very high cost of regravelling (gravel
sources in the area are scarce and rock crushing would be necessary) and
the eventual need to construct the road to paved standard.  The economic
analysis of the other three sections showed that paving was not justified
at this time, except for the Kalungulu-Champhoya section (10.5 km) which is
too short a section to pave.  The three sections will be gravelled only
once because of the inadequate supply of gravel in the area. The economic
viability of paving these three sections should be re-evaluated following
establishment of the wood-processing industries.

Rate of Return
Total Project (169 km)                                              19%
Jenda-Luwawa T.off (32 km)                                          13%

Mbowe-Mzuzu (17 km)                                                 16%
Mzuzu-Ekwendeni (20 km)                                             30%
(v) Sensitivity
4.11      The various components of the economic evaluation have not been
estimated with equal degrees of reliability. To determine the sensitivity
of the ER to variations in the estimated costs and benefits, an analysis was
carried out, assuming an overall increase in costs and decrease in benefits,
both separately and individually. The results of this analysis indicate that
with either a 20% increase in costs or only a 5% growth in traffic, the ER
would be 16%. A combination of the two would yield an ER of 13%, which is
still above 12%, the estimated opportunity cost of capital in Malawi.
2.   District Road Improvement and Maintenance Program (DRIMP)
(a) Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.12      Under the proposed extension of DRIMP to ten additional districts,
maintenance units would be established in all ten districts and about 2,600
km of district roads would be improved and subsequently maintained. Benefits
from the works to be undertaken are expected in the form of:
(a) vehicle operating cost savings to nonagricultural traffic,
although traffic will not be sufficiently high to alone
justify improvement for many of the roads, and
(b) increases in agricultural production made possible by
easier access to farms and markets.



- 35 -
The economic analysis assumes that improved access to agricultural extension
services and marketing facilities will induce farmers not only to increase
the productivity of the land already cultivated, but also to put more avail-
able land under cultivation. Evidence from the IDA-financed Lilongwe Land
Development Program (Crs. 113, 244, and 550-MAI) would tend to support the
above assumptions, since the program's success in promoting the use of both
improved seeds and fertilizer primarily hinged on the road network, which
allowed the timely and adequate provision of inputs.
4.13      Significant benefits are also expected from institution building,
since training as well as equipment and depots will be provided to the
District Councils so that they may gradually be able to expand their road
maintenance capacity. There will also be benefits from reduced spoilage of
produce and improved access to health, education and other social and adminis-
trative facilities for those residing in the influence area of the project
roads.
4.14      Most of the benefits from the reduction in transport costs will
accrue to (a) the road transporters, since ADMARC pays them fixed rates for
transportation of goods to and from rural markets, and (b) the farmers living
within the roads influence area, assuming reduced transport costs are passed
on to them. The main beneficiaries from the increased agricultural production
and improved access to social amenities will be those residing in the vicinity
of the roads.
(b) Economic Analysis
4.15       Selection of the district roads to be improved during the 3-year
period covered by the second phase of DRIMP will be based on socioeconomic
criteria, and all roads will have an estimated rate of return of at least 12%.
The economic analysis of the roads include an estimate of benefits not only
from vehicle operating cost savings, but also from incremental agricul-
tural production, the latter based on farm models representative of the
areas of influence of the roads proposed for improvement. Details of the
methodology employed are included in Annex 11. The selection criteria
and methodology for calculating the rate of return were agreed with Government
during appraisal. In May 1980, Government appointed consultants to select
all roads to be included in the program. Government and the Association have
agreed on roads to be improved during the first year of the program, and roads
to be improved in subsequent years will be agreed annually not later than four
months before the beginning of each fiscal year (para. 5.01(b)).
3.   Other Project Elements
4.16      The remaining project components include the comprehensive study
of maintenance needs in preparation for a 5-year maintenance program, tech-
nical assistance to prepare the third phase of DRIMP and to strengthen
transport planning and coordination, and the provision of some maintenance
equipment as well as facilities for MWS's new training center in Lilongwe.
All five components will help to reverse the country's deteriorating road



- 36 -
maintenance performance and are justified on those grounds; the technical
assistance for transport planning will also assist in improving budget
management, thus reducing the risk of misallocating scarce funds. The
maintenance study is particularly important by assisting Government to _
plan for the technical, financial and manpower requirements for the main-
tenance of its rapidly increasing road network and could pave the way for
further IDA lending for maintenance. At present the project-funded mainte-
nance equipment and training facilities will begin to address some of the
country's needs.
B.   Risks
4.17      Other than the risks already discussed in the sensitivity analysis
(para. 4.11), there are no major risks associated with the upgrading of
the Jenda-Mzuzu-Ekwendeni road. However, the major risk threatening both
DRIMP and the maintenance program to be agreed under the project is the
availability of Government's financial resources for maintenance of both the
national and district road networks. To minimize the risk, agreement has been
reached on Government financing of maintenance costs. The Association would
help to cushion the burden by financing the incremental maintenance costs for
DRIMP on a declining basis.  However, the Government's eventual ability to
uphold these agreements will depend on the strength of its economy and its
continued responsiveness to the needs of the road subsector.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
5.01      Agreement has been reached with Government:
(a) on a list of facilities (depots, housing, equipment, tools) to be
provided and on a list of district roads to be improved during the
first year of the second phase of DRIMP; the work program for
subsequent years will be agreed not later than four months before
the beginning of each fiscal year until completion of this project
component (para. 3.07);
(b) on a system of financial assistance for recurrent maintenance
to be provided by Government to the District Councils and the
allocations needed during the project period. The appropriate-
ness of allocations will be discussed annually, not later than four
months before the beginning of each fiscal year, by Government
and IDA on the basis of MWS's updated estimates of the funds required
by the District Councils (para. 3.08);
(c) that by December 31, 1981, a transport economist will be appointed
to assist EPD, having qualifications and experience and under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Association. It has also been
agreed that by June 1, 1981, Government will select the first of
about three candidates for overseas training in transport planning
and the remaining ones by December 31, 1981; the trainees quali-
fications and the proposed training program will be satisfactory to
the Association (para. 3.09);



- 3 7 -
(d) (i) on maintenance allocations for the next two years; (ii)
that Government will exchange views with the Association on the
findings and recommendations of the maintenance study, which is to
be completed by May 31, 1982; (iii) that Government will establish a
rolling 5-year maintenance program satisfactory to the Association
to implement the recommendations of the study; and (iv) that there-
after not later than four months before the beginning of each fiscal
year until five years after completion of the project, Government
will exchange views with the Association on the 5-year rolling
program, including each year's maintenance works and allocations
(para. 3.09);
(e) on the number and types of equipment to be procured for MWS
(paras. 3.10 and 3.17);
(f) on facilities to be provided for MWS's new training center in
Lilongwe (para. 3.10);
(g) that consultants will be employed on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association (para. 3.16);
(h) on a project implementation schedule (para. 3.18) as well
as progress reporting requirements, and the submission of
a project completion report (para. 3.22); and
(i) that all project accounts will be audited by the Auditor
General and that the audited accounts together with the
auditor's report will be submitted to IDA not later than
six months after the end of the fiscal year (para. 3.22).
5.02      The proposed project is suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR 25.9
million (US$33.0 million equivalent) to the Government of Malawi on standard
terms.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Training of Subprofessional Staff of the Ministry of Works and Supplies
1.        The Ministry of Works and Supplies (MWS) currently conducts a
variety of training courses for technicians and other subprofessionals at
its training center at Zomba. These courses are directed at foremen and
supervisors who deal with buildings, roads and equipment; short courses
are also offered to drivers and upgrading courses to mechanics and their
supervisors. Although MWS is not responsible for water supply services,
during the last few years the center has offered a course for water works
foremen and a short upgrading course for their supervisors. In the future,
the center may also offer courses for draftsmen as well as architectural
and landscape assistants. The 1980/81 budget includes MK320,000 for the
training center's operating expenses.
2.        The training center has two main training methods:
(a) Residential Instruction: Trainees reside at the center
for the duration of their course and are taught theory
and practical work. After successfully completing the
course, trainees are presented with certificates and
,re posted to various department of the Ministry
according to their specialization.
(b) In-Service Instruction: After completing the residential
course, trainees are sent to the field for practical
training under the guidance of a senior member of the
Ministry.
3.        The following personnel took residential courses at the training
center in 1978 and 1979.
Basic Courses                                         1978       1979

Total                    247        272
4.        The 15 instructors of the training center are former subprofessional
staff who have had a substantial amount of practical experience in the
various fields concerned and have been given additional training overseas.
The local instructors are also assisted by a team of volunteers under the
Japanese Overseas Corporation Volunteers Scheme who teach specialized
courses for mechanics. In addition, equipment manufacturers sponsor courses
to train operators and foremen in the use of graders, dozers, loaders, etc.
5.        Most courses can accommodate a maximum of 15 trainees, although
some courses for electrical foremen, mechanical apprentices and upgrading
courses in various trades are being included without the provision of
extra facilities.
6.        The existing training center in Zomba has adequate instructors,
training equipment and training aids for MWS's current staffing requirements,
but is not expected to meet the future training needs of the various depart-
ments, including that for roads. As more main and secondary roads are
improved and bituminized and the District Roads Improvement and Maintenance
Program is extended throughout the country, road maintenance requirements, and
therefore Roads Department staffing needs, will increase appreciably. To
provide an expanded staff, subprofessional personnel will have to be trained
for higher positions, while more lower-level staff would be trained in high-
ways operations. The increased need for staff is also exacerbated by Govern-
ment s low retirement age -- 50 years.
7.        In preparation for the expanded training effort, the training
center building, its equipment and instructors will also need expansion.
However, since the existing training center in Zomba is located in the midst
of a built-up area, any substantial expansion at the present location is

impossible. It has therefore been proposed to move the center from Zomba
to Lilongwe where the Ministry's main activities are now concentrated (all
ministries were previously located in Zomba) and where, because of its
greater convenience, the Ministry's professional staff will be able to
give supplementary lectures to the trainees. The new training center in
Lilongwe would be built on a phased basis, and would comprise a classroom
block, student dormitory facilities, and staff housing. As presently con-
ceived by MWS, total facilities required for the new center and associated
costs, are as follows:

training aids                   200,000
Total     1,480,000
The first phase of this development, outlined in Attachment 1 hereto (i.e.,
facilities to accommodate 25 trainees in road construction and maintenance),
would be financed under the project. This would allow the training of about
50 road personnel annually, more than twice the current number.

FOURTH HIGHWAY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
DRIMP II: Government Financing and Accounting of
DRIMP Maintenance Expenditure
The procedure to be used for making available funds to District Councils
for maintenance, for keeping the necessary records and for preparing
claims for reimbursement will be as follows:
(a) As soon as possible after the beginning of the fiscal
year and in any case no later than 30th April, the
Government will pay to each District Council 75% of the
full amount to be made available in that fiscal year
(including the funds required to prefinance expenditures
eligible for reimbursement out of the proceeds of the
Credit (see Attachment)) for the maintenance of roads
and no later than 30th September will pay the balance.
(b) Each District Council will maintain full records of
all road maintenance expenditures and will submit
records of such expenditures, including those financed
out of the District Council's own resources, with full
supporting documents to the Ministry of Works and
Supplies at the end of each month.
(c) At the end of each quarter the Ministry of Works and
Supplies will prepare a claim for reimbursement based
on the records submitted by the District Council. This
claim for reimbursement will show the full amount spent
by the District Council, the agreed input by the District
Council and the amount eligible for reimbursement from
IDA calculated in accordance with the Credit Agreement,
and will be accompanied by a certificate from the MOWS
which will state that the claim is correct and that a
physical inspection has shown the maintenance work to
have been carried out.
(d) The MOWS will retain the records of expenditure and
certificates referred to in (b) and (c) above and
these documents will be subject to inspection by the
International Development Association.

C.   RLad Maintenance Program
- the basis of the analysis of findings of Section B and other
considera:ions described in this section, the Consultants shall draw up a
road rehabilitation and maintenance program to be carried out by MWS, the
Distri.it Counciis and the urban highway authorities over the period 1963
through 1987.  The program, which shall differentiate between rehabiLitation
works, routine and periodic maintenance works, shall be based on technical and
economic criteria and shall take into account Government's, the District
Councils' and the urban highway authorities' plans for the improvement and
expansion of the road system, as well as growth of traffic during the program
period. The Consultants shall also identify all investment, operational,
organizational, budgetary and other raquirements necessary to implement the
program. The Consultants' report shall include:
(a) recommendationE of the road network to be maintained
by MWS, the District Counc_Is and the urban highway
authorities; in addition to summarized inventories,
the networks, classified as agreed with MWS, shall be
shown on reproducible maps, countrywide at a scale of
1:1,000,000, in a form suitable as a basis for a road
map, and for each district separately at a scale of
1:250,000;
(b) recommendations on improvements in operation and pro-
cedures of maintenance works that could lead to better
utilization of equipment, facilities, manpower, and
materials, including recommendations on the most appro-
priate mix of labor and equipment for the different
maintenance operations;
(c) determination of the level of rehabilitation and main-
tenance for different road types and traffic levels,
incorporating an assessment of the effect of different
levels of maintenance on vehicle operating costs as
well as subsequent maintenance and rehabilitation
costs. If the economically optimal level of program
is not considered feasible due to financial, managerial
or other intractable constraints, a "constrained optimum"
program which is feasible and practicable will be
developed in accordance with the principles of incre-
mental cost-benefit analysis. 1/ The economic analysis
shall include an assessment of the sensitivity of the
1/   See, for example, T. Watanatada and C. Harral, "Determination of Eco-
nomically Balanced Highway Expenditure Programs under Budget Constraints:
A Practical Approach," paper presented to the World Conference on Trans-
port Research (London, April 1980).

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
Project Progress Reporting Requirements
A.   Project Progress Reports
1.        The borrower will prepare Progress Reports that should be submitted
quarterly in triplicate, no later than one calendar month after the end of
the quarter. The first report should cover the quarter ending June 30,
1981.
2.        The information that Progress Reports should contain is described
below:
(a)  General information:  this section should refer to
Project Monitoring indices (Attachment) in reporting
the following:
(i) the physical progress accomplished during the
reporting period;
(ii) actual or expected deviations from the project
implementation schedule;
(iii) actual or expected difficulties or delays and
their effects on the implementation schedule,
and the steps planned or taken to overcome
the difficulties and avoid further delay;
(iv) expected changes in the completion date of the
project;
(v) key personnel changes in the staffs of the MWS's
Roads Department, consultants or contractor;
(vi) matters which may affect the cost of the project;
and
(vii) any development activity likely to affect the
economic viability of project components.
(b) A bar-type progress chart, based on the project implementation
scheduled, should show the progress in each project component.



- 78 -
ANNEX 9
Page 2 of 3
(c) A financial statement should be set out in tabular form
and indicate for each project component:
(i) original estimated cost;
(ii) revised cost, if appropriate;
(iii) actual expenditure;
(iv) projected expenditure; and
(v) actual and projected withdrawals from the Credit
Account.
(d) Finally, Progress Reports should state the status of action
on each covenant of the Credit Agreement.
3,        Progress Reports will be an important input in the preparation of
the Project Completion Report.
B.   Project Completion Report
4.        The borrower will prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR), to be
submitted to the Association not later than six (6) months after the Closing
Date.
5.        The primary objective of the PCR is to reinforce self-evaluation by
the Borrower and the Association's operating departments and to facilitate
dissemination of lessons learned through the project:
(a)  the performance by the Borrower and the Association
of their respective obligations under the Credit
Agreement and whether the Association could have been
more helpful;
(b)  the results that can be expected from the project, as
compared with expectations at appraisal, and whether
the original expectations were realistic; and
(c)  whether in retrospect the project was worth doing or
could have been done better.
6.        For those components of the project for which a rate of return
was estimated during appraisal, the PCR should contain a new estimate of the
return the project is now likely to yield and analyze the reasons for physical
or economic deviations. However, the new rate of return calculation should
be as simple as possible under the circumstances and should absorb only a
minor portion of the time devoted to the preparation of the PCR. An annex
with the relevant information supporting this analysis should be included.



- 79 -
ANNEX 9
Page 3 of 3
7.        The basic documents to be referred to are:
Credit application.
Feasibility studies, preappraisal report, project brief.
Appraisal report.
Credit Agreement documents, supplementary letters, etc.
Supervision Reports.
Quarterly Progress Reports.
Project Correspondence Files.
Miscellaneous evaluation reports.
8.        The Highways Division, Eastern Africa Projects Department, will
review and comment on the PCR in consultation with the Programs Department.
After approval by the Highway Division Chief, the PCR is sent to the Bank
Group's Operations Evaluation Department (OED) which is responsible for
conducting an audit of the project subsequent to the PCR exercise. This
audit can lead to suggestions for changes or additions in the PCR as OED

Terms of Reference for the Economic Analysis and Selection
Criteria for Improvement of District Roads under DRIMP
Introduction
1.        The second phase of DRIMP provides for improvement of all district
roads in the ten districts proposed for inclusion in the program. However,
since improvement of some of these roads will not be justified, at least
during the program period, a selection process is necessary to eliminate
those roads not justified on socioeconomic grounds. This will leave
capacity under the program to improve important rural roads which are not
designated as district roads, but which have already been identified by the
District Councils as high priority roads in need of improvement.
2.        All district and other rural roads will be screened as outlined
below and, if they pass the screening criteria, will be subject to economic
evaluation. In addition, some roads will be subject to further social evalua-
tion procedures. Although all roads to be improved will be identified before
Phase II of DRIMP begins, the program will be flexible and provide for
updating of the list of roads whenever necessary.
Screening
3.        It is important to screen the list of district and other roads
recommended for inclusion in the program at an early stage in order to avoid
costly and unnecessary project preparation work. The screening criteria
outlined below will be applied after all the roads proposed for the program
have been marked on an appropriately large-scale map of the area (in itself a
screening device):
(a) all roads to be improved should connect with: existing roads
in good and maintainable condition; roads to be constructed at
about the same time as the proposed roads are to be improved;
or with a facility such as a local market;
(b) there should be no other economically viable transport alter-
native within a distance of about 2 km of the proposed road
or other reasonable distance in the case of physical barriers,
such as a river;



- 83 -
ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 4
(c) the area to be served by the proposed road should be covered
by a development program, such as an agricultural extension
service, credit facilities, or an agricultural cooperative
program.  The program should preferably have already been
established; however, if there is a definite commitment
by Government to a planned program which is already at an
advanced stage of preparation, the proposed road should
not be excluded from the program; and
(d) all roads should be below a maximum per kilometer cost
unless above-average benefits are expected from improvement
of the road. One of the first tasks of consultants carrying
out the selection process will be to determine the per
kilometer maximum cost, after estimating the maximum number
of kilometers to be improved with the given resources avail-
able. The inclusion of roads with significantly higher
costs than average will mean that the total length of roads
to be improved under the program would be reduced; only if
the benefits of such roads are particularly high will it be
justified to include them.
Those roads that pass screening should be subject to the following evaluation
process.
Evaluation
4.        The initial pilot study indicates that a significant proportion of
district roads will have traffic levels of over 10 vpd, although this will
vary from one district to another. A number of roads may therefore meet the
minimum rate of return criteria on the basis of vehicle operating cost savings
alone, without the need for further analysis of other benefits. It will
therefore be very important to obtain reliable traffic counts on such roads.
5.        For other roads it will be necessary to estimate the increase in
agricultural producer surplus due to improvement of the road and associated
development programs. It is a common practice to evaluate agricultural
projects on the basis of farm models which are typical of the local crop-
ping patterns and representative of the area. Similar models should be
developed for the areas of influence of the proposed roads. More than one
farm model may apply in any given district, depending on the variety of
cropping patterns. The farm models should not only be based on patterns
of production but also on the developmental level of the area (subsistence
farming, level of farm technology and market orientation, etc.), and an
assessment of the capacity of the population to develop the potential for
agricultural development. Once the farm models have been developed, their
suitability will be reviewed and revised, if necessary, by the appropriate
agricultural agencies, as this will not be within the purview of the Roads
Department.



- 84 -
ANNEX 11
Page 3 of 4
6.        Each area of influence of the proposed road (estimated at approxi-
mately 4 km) should be examined to determine the following:
(a) the area of cultivated and cultivable land;
(b) the fertility and suitability of the land, taking into
account such factors as soil characteristics, climate,
topography, water availability, etc.; and
(c) the farm model which is most representative of the area.
When the above data have been collected, the increase in agricultural produc-
tion after improvement of the proposed road can be estimated on the basis of
application of the farm models. Some indication of the magnitude of such
benefits can be obtained from at least one evaluation study, which has been
carried out in Malawi's Lilongwe District, where the increase in producer
surplus has been estimated after roads have been improved, without expansion
of agricultural extension programs. All costs associated with realizing the
potential benefits should be estimated and included in the economic analysis;
this should include not only incremental costs of improved inputs but also
the costs of improved methods, i.e., labor and extension service costs.
The potential incremental producer surplus that will result from improvement
of the road should then be correlated with development potential, cultivated
and cultivable land, and fertility/suitability of the land, to arrive at a
reasonable estimate of benefits given the above factors. This may mean that
where the development potential or fertility/suitability of the land is low,
only half of the potential increase in producer surplus will be realized, or
where they are high, nearly all potential benefits will be realized.
7.        It will not be necessary to calculate economic rates of return for
every road, but rather for representative roads serving reasonably homogenous
areas. The level of benefits yielding a 12% rate of return should be deter-
mined, using the average cost of road improvements in each area, so that roads
falling below this rate can be excluded from the program unless justified on
other grounds (para. 8). For roads with improvement costs above the average,
minimum rates of return can be estimated for each band of costs, i.e., 1-25%,
26-50%, 51-75%, etc., over the average cost. Roads which are marginal can be
examined in more detail. All benefits should be net of incremental costs, not
only for increased inputs such as fertilizers and seeds, but also additional
agricultural extension costs or the costs of extending credit facilities,
cooperative or mechanization programs, etc.
8.        The distribution of project benefits between farmers, middlemen
(including transporters) and consumers needs to be examined to ensure that
farmers will recoup at least a significant portion of the benefits. Also,
there should be an indication of the size of farms to be served by the road,
so as to ensure that most of the benefits of the program are going to the
smaller farmers. In addition to size of landholding, such social criteria
as income level of inhabitants within the area of influence of the road, and
average distance to educational, health, and other social and administrative

ANNEX 1 1
Page 4 of 4
facilities should be evaluated for roads that are economically marginal.
The importance of social considerations and improved accessibility should
be given in as quantified terms as possible (e.g., estimated change in school
attendance ratios, delivery of health services in terms of visits to health
clinics, etc.). Where the social indicators show a significant impact on the
community as a result of improving the road, but the economic evaluation is
marginal, a separate case can be made for including the proposed road in the
program.
