PtIEFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) relates to IDA Credit 1076-LBR
of SDR3.2 million to the Government of Liberia to support small- and medium-
scale enterprises. .he project was approved by the Board on November 18, 1980
and was declared effective on September 14, 1981. The closing date was
extended three times from June 30, 1984 to June 30, 1987. The Credit has not
been closed yet as there is still an outstanding Special Account being
recovered. The Loan Department is actively pursuing the recovery of the
initial deposit. The current suspension of Bank Group disbursements to
Liberia was in force at the present closing date of June 30, 1987. 71X of the
credit had been disbursed. The balance is in the process of being cancelled.
The PCR was prepared by staff of the Western Africa Department,
based on information obtained from the Staff Appraisal Report, President's
Report, legal documents, supervision reports, progress reports, project
correspondence files and subloan application documents. No Bank mission was
sent out for the purpose of preparing the PCR.
This PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED).
The draft PCR was sent to the Borrower and the implementing agencies for
comments, which have been reflected in this report and reproduced as Annex X.

RIGHLIGHTS
The Govternment of Liberia was the recipient of the SDR3.2
million credit, the main objectives of which were tot (a) develop an
appropriate institution that would provide the necessary assistance to
entrepreneurs in planning and managing their investments; and (b) encourage
local financial institutions to increase their support of local businesses
(para. 4.01-4.02). The credit was approved by the Board in November 1980,
became effective in September 1981 and, in effect, closed as of June 1987.
The business environment in Liberia deteriorated substantially
during the project's implementation period as the country witnessed serious
economic, financial and political turmoil (para. 2.01-2.02). Changes in
personnel brought about uncertainty in the civil service and public
agencies and critical delays in project implementation. The Project
Analysis Department in the National Bank of Liberia (NBL), responsible for
managing the credit component, was not established until January 1984. The
technical assistance component was to be implemented by the Liberian
Development Corporation (LDC). The Government disbanded LDC in September
1979 and created National Investment Commission (NIC) with a broad mandate
of coordinating investment policies in the country. Although NIC
immediately set up a Small and Hedium Enterprise (SME) Department, it had
not reached the operational level required to implement the technical
assistance component of the project by the time the Credit became
effective. As a result, implementation of the project was off to a very
slow start.
The slow implementation was compounded by frequent and long
suspension of disbursements to Liberia by the Bank Group. The closing date
was extended three times. By the original closing date (June 30, 1984),
only 15? of the credit had been disbursed (Annex VII ). 71? of the credit
was disbursed by the final revised closing date (June 30, 1987). The
balance ic now in the process of being cancelled.
The project's achievements were mixed. The line of credit and
technical assistance helped develop indigenous private sector enterprises
in a country that had done very little, until the time of the project, to
support local enterprises. The project contributed to institution building
of the NBL, NIC and participating financial institutions, especially the
Small Enterprises Financing Organization (SEPO). The institutional support
system provided rhrough NIC forged complimentarity between industrial
extension services and project finance. Technical assistance, after -t was
redesigned, appeared to have been a useful and appreciated service. The
most important elements of NIC's technical assistance were in connection
with the selection of machinery and training of entrepreneurs in accounting
procedures. An apex lending arrangement and an institutional support
system have been established and need to be consolidated further and
supported by the Bank when Bank Group operations in Liberia are resumed.
The objective of encouraging local financial institutions to
increase their support of local businesses was achieved only partially.
Eleven financial institutions were expected to participate in the project;



- vi -
only three actually took part (one of them reluctantly). None of the
ci-wnercial or foreign banks operating in Liberia participated in the
project. SEP0, which did not exist at the time of appraisal, was the most
active participant in the project and is likely to continue to give strong
support to the small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs). Eighty-six SMEs
(compared to 74 projected at appraisal). 922 of them being small scale
enterprises (SSEs), benefited from the line of credit. Difbursements for
SSE subloans exceeded appraisal estimates by 682 while disbursements for
m3dium-scale enterprise subloans fell below appraisal estimates by almost
902. About 292 of the SMEs were in agriculture related industries; 28S in
service industries; 21Z in wood industries; and 62 in other industries.
The enterprises were expected to generate 662 jobs at an average cost of
about $5,000 per job.
IDA supervision missions were fairly regular except in 1985 when
there was none. They contributed to developing short range revised work
programs and implementation schedules de¢ite prevailing problems in the
country.
All the three financial institutions that participated in the
project are faced with high loan default rates. Aging of the arrears is a
big problem. As of September 30, 1986, loan repayments due to the
institutic,ns in arrears of six months or more as a percent of total arrears
were as followst SEFO 972, LBDI 79Z, and ACBD 892 (Annex VI). Financial
performance of the subprojects is not very good. About 402 of the subloans
under Credit 1076 were in arrears of six months or more, accounting for
about 802 of the total amount in arrears as of the above date. However,
the enterprises funded under the project contributed to Liberia's economy
in terms of value added and job creation.
Overall, performance of the Borrower was poor. The Project
Policy Analysis Department was not established until late into the life of
the project and it was not fully staffed when established. Budgetary
appropriations to NIC were insufficient in most cases leading to some
positions not being filled. The NBL did not furnish to the Bank certified
copies of financial statements and annual audit reports for 1986 and 1987.
The following conclusions and lessons can be drawn from the
project's experiences
(a) The credit was granted at a time when the Liberian
institutions were not ready to operate a relatively complex
SME financing scheme. In retrospect, a technical
assistance program to prepare NIC, the NBL's Credit
Guarantee Scheme and a financial institution, like SEFO, to
adequately perform their functions under a future credit
program would have been more appropriate;
(b) The willingness of commercial and development banks to
participate in this type of lending arrangement should be
assessed more critically during appraisal. Perhaps a
slower disbursement rate would have been projected had it



- vii -
been determined at appraisal that only three out of eleven
potential financial institutions would participate in the
project;
(c)  Given the scarcity of skilled huran resources in countries
like Liberia and to avoid duplication, Bank technical
assistance should be integrated with ongoing technical
assistance programs funded by other donors whenever
possible;
(d)  Including training in simple business skills, such as
simple book-keeping techniques for entrepreneurs, is
critical to the success of lending to small-scale
enterprises (para. 4.07). and
(e) While suspension of Bank Group disbursements for non-
payment of earlier loans and credits is necessary, it has a
serious impact on ongoing projects and adds to
implementation difficulties and adverse performance.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SMALL AND MEDIUM-SCALE ENTERPRISE PROJECT
CREDIT 1076-LBR
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1978, the Government of Liberia requested the Bank to explore
the possibilities of establishing a technical and financial assistance
program for small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs). A Bank sector
mission was followed by consultants' studies, including a comprehensive
survey of SMEs in the country. A project concept developed during
discussions with the Government. The project was appraised in May, 1979
and approved by the Board on November 18, 1980. At the time of appraisal,
Liberian Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI) was and still is the
major source of term financing in Liberia. The project was to complement
LBDI's Bank-supported assistance to medium and large-industrial projects by
making available to LBDI and other financial intermediaries financial and
technical resources which were suited for smaller enterprises.
1.02      The credit had two primary objectives: (a) to develop an
appropriate institution that would provide the necessary assistance to
entrepreneurs in planning and managing their investments; and (b) to
encourage local financial institutions to increase their support of local
businesses. The pvoject would thus support the Government's effort to
broaden the industrial base and increase local participation and employment
in industrial activities in the country.
1I. THE ENVIRONMEN
A. Economic Background
2.01      Liberia's overall economic and financial position deteriorated
substantially during the project's implementation period. GDP and
consumption per capita declined significantly, while public and private
investment fell sharply. These developments were due to a marked drop in
production, a significant deterioration in terms of trade, a major erosion
of financial discipline, and a loss of internal as well as external
confidence that led to a large outflow of carital and skilled manpower.
Private and official capital inflows dried up. while arrears on external
debt service rose sharply. The US dollar notes, the legal tender in
Liberia, virtually disappeared from circulation and Liberian coins,
officially at par with the US dollar, were exchanged against the dollar at
a substantial discount in the parallel exchange market.
2.02      Real GDP (at 1981 prices) is estimated to have declined at an
Annual average rate of 1.2 S during the period 1981-86. The major cause of



-2-
this poor overall growth performance was the substantial decline in the
value added of the iron ore sector, which declined at an annual average
rate of 5.5? over the period. A sharp compression of imports and a tight
liquidity situation adversely affected the manufacturing, trade,
traasportation, and construction sectors. While the agricultural sector
ovezall experienced a modest positive average growth rate, the subsectors
showed generally mixed performance. The rubber subsector had some modest
gains in output, especially during 1983-84; recorded output of coffee and
cocoa fell s)-',Jly; rice production recorded some modest growth, but at a
rate substan.dally lower than the 3.42 annual average growth in population.
The sustained decline in real GDP resulted in nearly a 20? fall in GDP per
capita over the period. 11
2.03      A substantial shift in the structure of the economy occurred
during the period as a result of the different growth rates experienced by
the various sectors. The relative share of the iron ore sector in GDP
declined from 122 to 9?, continuing a trend that began in the mid-1970s
when the sector contributed an average 272 of GDP. The agricultural sector,
boosted in part by the recovery in rubber production,increased its relative
share from 27? to 322 (compared with 122 in 1975). The share of government
services fell from about 172 to 152 while that of forestry (mainly
logging) increased slightly from 5 to 6Z. 2/ The manufacturing sector's
share remained steady at about 72.
2.04      Preliminary estimates show that real GDP declined by about 12 in
1987 as a result of a further fall in iron ore output, poor performance of
cocoa and coffee, and manufact -ing and service sectors which continued to
experience liquidity and foreign exchange difficulties. Economic
performance in 1988 was not expected to be any better than in 1987.
B. The Industrial Sector
2.05      Liberia's industrial sector, consisting of mining,
manufacturing, construction, electricity and water, accounts for over 20Z
of GDP (Table 2.1). Mining is dominated by iron ore while manufacturing is
centered around import substitution activities. There has been a
substantial decline in the value added of the iron ore subsector (para.
2.02). Sawn timber and plywood are the only significant manufactured
exports. Large-scale manufacturing enterprises are few and centered almost
exclusively on import substitution. They are mainly owned by foreigners.
Medium-scale enterprises are engaged largely in the production of food and
related items, household furniture and woodwork, block making and auto
I/  The extent of the decline in value added in some sectors is probably
overstated by official GDP statistics. It is believed that a
substantial amount of unrecorded transactions take place, especially
with respect to cocoa, coffee, and diamond sectors.
2/   The share of the forestry sector is likely to be underestimated as it
is believed that a significant portion of logging activity and
exports is unrecorded.

repair. Most of them are either wholly foreign-owned or have very limited
Liberian participation. Small-scale enterprises are generally Liberian
owned and controlled. Economic activities in this sector include block-
making, garment-making, carpentry and upholstery. Petroleum products
(refinery) account for about two-thirds of manufacturing value added. The
remainder is accounted for by food products, beverages, cement and cement
blocks, and chemical products.  The bulk of m_=ufacturing activities occur
in Monrovia. There are few large firms located up-country except those
associated with forestry and agricultural enclaves. Firms with more than
50 e-ployees are found mostly in the food, wood and furniture, and chemical
industries.
2.06      The manufacturing sector grew at a rate of about 121 in real
terms in the late sixties and early seventies. Growth of the sector
stagnated from the mid-1970's as import-substitution possibilities were
full, exploited. The sector's performance started declining from the
beginning of the eighties. Performance during the eighties has been
adversely affected by liquidity problems that generally characterized the
period, the slowdown in major productive sectors. and the general erosion
of business confidence. Liquidity and security of collateral problems have
forced banks to restrict access to credit and foreign exchange. There has
been, however, some small increase in the number of enterprises in light
industry operating under duty-free concession and incentive contracts.
Capacity utilization is very low, labor productivity continues to fall, sud
shortage of skilled labor persists.
2.07      The main issues in the sector are how to attract investment in
small and medium-scale enterprises, rehabilitate existing private and
state-owned enterprises, and increase capacity utilization. Given limited
capital availability, skills and management capability and in order to
stimulate output and employment in the sector, the Government adopted a
strategy of promoting SMEs and set up a Small and Medium-Scale Enterprises
Department within the National Investment Commission. The worsening
economic situation has not allowed the Government to focus attention on
some of the measures introduced earlier to promote the sector.
C. The Financial Sector
2.08      Liberia's financial system consists of the National Bank of
Liberia (NBL), eight commercial banks, one development bank, two finance
and trust companies, and a number of insurance companies, cooperatives, and
credit unions. A National Social Security scheme has been in existence for
some time, although it is reported to be only partially operational. The
NBL, established in 1973 with the IHF assistance, is a quasi-central bank
whose primary functions are to supervise overall banking activities,
perform clearing house operations, extend credit to the Government and
banks, and regulate currency supply. It does not have the mandate to issue
banknotes, but issues Liberian coins. Its capacity to extend credit to the
Government is limited to the amounts it can borrow from abroad and obtain
from the commercial banks, and to the amount of Liberian coins issued. The
NBL's capacity to intervene as lender of last resort is very limited due to
the lack of its own resources. Five of the eight commercial banks are



-4-
branches or wholly owned subsidiaries of foreign banks. Two of the
remaining three are publicly-owned, representing 43Z of the total banking
sector's assets in the mid-1980s. The third, the Bank c. Liberia, has been
in the process of liquidation since 1981. Minimum interest rates on
deposits and maximum lending rates are regulated by the Government.
2.09      Inadequate demand-management policies, a series of external
economic shocks, and domestic political upheavals combined to destabilize
the financial system in the early 1980s, leading eventually to a near
breakdown of the monetary and banking system. Net claims on Government
increased by 3402 between June 1980 and December 1986. The ratio of net
claims on Government to domestic credit rose from 36Z in June 1980 to 752
in December 1986, while claims or, public corporations increased by 40?
between June 1981 and December 1986. Claims on the private sector,
traditionally the main channel for commercial bank credit, declined by 55Z
between June 1980 and June 1983 as a result of depressed macroeconomic
situation and uncertain legal status of commercial lending collateral.
These claims increased only by 6.22 between June 1983 and December 1986.
Outstanding credit to the private sector remained well below the level
before 1980. Relative shares of domestically-oriented sectors such as
manufacturing, construction, transpoL -, and public corporations in
commercial bank credit fell substantially, as did the shares of trading,
hotel and restaurants. Agriculture's relative share increased slightly,
mainly as a result of a significant rise in credit given to the rubber
sector. These developments were a reflection of the increasing liquidity
and foreign exchange shortages created by the disappearance of US dollar
notes from circulation, and the concentration of commercial bank operations
on foreign exchange generating activities. Data for the first quarter of
1988 show that these trends are continuing.
2.10      There has been a fundamental change in the structure of the
money supply since the early 1980s. The ratio of coins in circulation to
broad money (excluding US dollar notes) increased from 10 in 1981 to 32?
by end of 1986. On the other hand, deposits declined by 11? between June
1980 and June 1982. There was a slight improvement in the deposit
situation in the subsequent years, but the structure of deposits
deteriorated significantly during the period. The ratio of quasi-money to
broad money declined from 43Z in June 1981 to 282 in December 1986 and the
share of time deposits in total deposits fell from 161 to 12? during the
period.
2.11      Increasing issuance of government checks against inadequate
balances has created difficulties for the interbank check-clearing system
since late 1984. Since these checks could not be cleared at the NBL,
commercial banks involuntarily accumulated excess reserves at the NBL. The
check-clearing system eventually broke down as commercial banks became
increasingly reluctant to cash or accept deposit checks drawn on the NBL or
other banks to conserve available cash resources. This increased
compartmentalization of the financial system and reduced financial
intermediation. There were significant improvements in the operations of
the check-clearing system during 1987 88 (following signing of a tripartite
memorandum of understanding between the Ministry of Finance, the NBL, and



-5-
commercial banks). but developments in monetary and credit aggregates
reflected for the most part a continuation of trends apparent in previous
years.
2.12      The role of commercial banks in the country has progressively
changed during recent years. Banks are now largely operating as foreign
exchange dealers and trade financiers, a function achieved partly at the
expense of their traditional role of financial intermediaries. This move
led to a significant improvement in commercial banks' reported
profitability during 1986 and 1987. However, the increase in reported
profits appears to have been partly due to some major banks (especially the
two publicly owned banks) not setting aside sufficient loss reserves and
overstating their actual interest income. Thus, the Liberian financial
system remains fragile and susceptible to disruptive developments. The
Government is reviewing various options aimed at strengthening the banking
system, including recapitalization of locally owned banks and setting up a
joint commercial banks' self-supporting fund to deal with temporary
liquidity crises.
III. NATIONAL BANE OF LIBERIA AND PARTICIPATING FINKANCIAL INSTItUTIONS
A. National Bank of Liberia
(i) Ownership
3.01      The National Bank of Liberia (NIL) is wholly owned by the
Government of Liberia which, under the NBL Act 1974 Sections 6 (2) and 7,
is responsible for (a) maintaining the bank's paid-up capital by issuing
from time to time non-negotiable and non-interest bearing securities,
which, in the judgement of the Board of Directors of the bank, are
necessary for preserving the paid-up capital from any impairment; and (b)
financing any excess of the ordinary expenses over the regular income of
the bank.
(ii) Nature of Operations
3.02      Under Section 4 of the NBL Act 1974, the NBL is to regulate the
availability of money, promote monetary stability, exchange conditions and
a sound financial structure conducive to the balanced growth of the economy
(see also para. 2.08).
(iii) Financial Performance and Condition
3.03      The NBL's audited income statemente and balance sheets for the
period 1981-85 are given in Annex I and Annex II, respectively. The bank
showed a consistent though modest profit for the years 1981 through 1985
with the exception of 1982 when it made a substantial loss. Profit as a
percentage of total assets increased from 0.04S in 1981 to 0.702 in 1985.
Administrative expenses fell from 0.75Z of total assets in 1981 to 0.492 in
1983 and then rose to 0.562 in 1985.



3.04      Assets of the NBL consist of foreign assets and loans advanced
to the public sector and the private sector. The value of assets almost
doubled between 1981 and 1985. The increase in NBL's assets has been
financed principally from external borrowing, particularly the DMF credit.
The massive increase in assets during the period under review has also been
financed by increasing the volume of coins in circulation.
(iv) NBL as the Anex Institution
3.05      The NBL was the implementing agency for the line of credit
component of the project. The Government onlent the credit component to
the participating financial institutions (PFIs) through the NBL which acted
as the apex institution. The NIL established a Project Analysis Department
and assigned full-time staff to manage the line of credit. The department
was set up very late. in January 1984, and was not fully staffed.
(v) Credit Guarantee Scheme
3.06      The NBL established a Credit Guarantee Scheme in 1978 in an
effort to encourage commercial banks to lend to Liberian entrepreneurs.
The guarantee initially covered 66.23Z of the amount of the loan in
default, but was increased to a maximum of 802 to compensate adequately the
lenders for the lack of collateral which is a major obstacle to access to
credit for small enterprises. Enterprises wholly owned by Liberians and
requiring loans below L$100,000 were elig4ble for the guarantee. Since the
scheme was established only in 1978, its track record was too short to
allow easy identification of possible weaknesses at the time the project
was appraised. The experience of the NBL's staff in operating a credit
guarantee system for small-scale enterprises was limited to the very few
operations under the existing scheme.
I. Participating Financial Institutions
3.07      At the time of appraisal, eleven financial institutions were
expected to participate in the apex lending scheme. However, given the
deteriorating economic climate in Liberia during the period, none of the
commercial or foreign banks operating in the country participated in the
scheme. Only three PFTh, Agricultural and Cooperative Development Bank
(ACDB), Liberian Bank for Development and Investment (LBDI) and Small
Enterprises Financing Organization (SEFO), participated.
(i) Atricultural and Cooperative Development Bank
3.08      The ACDB was established in November 1976 with the objective of
(a) providing short, medium and long-term credit to individual farmers,
either directly or through cooperatives, (b) promoting the development of
agricultural enterprises and rural industries, and (c) providing technical
advice and assistance to individual farmers and cooperatives. ACDB's
initial subscribed capital of L$2.25 million was held by the Government
(95?) and the Liberian Produce Marketing Corporation (5%). By 1985 ACDB's
stated capital had increased to L$3,378,900 and the shareholders were the



-7 -
Government (96.2X), Liberian Produce Marketing Corporation (3.1Z), Liberian
National Federation of Cooperative Societies (0.6?), and Liberia Credit
Union National Association (0.1S). It had accumulated capital surplus
amounting to L$3,257,686 by 1985.
3.09      At the time of appraisal senior management of the ACDB was
considered fairly competent. Due to its presence in rural areas, the
bank's participation in the project was considered to be important for the
development of rural industries.
3.10      ACDB's balance sheets, income statements and selected financial
ratios for the period 1984-86 are summarized in Annex T1. ACDB showed a
substantial increase in assets in 1985 with total assets increasing from
L$15.3 million in 190l to L$36.0 million in 1985. This was achieved
primarily by the incrZase in demand deposits from L$5.9 million in 1984 to
L$18.4 million in 1985. As a result, the debt/equity ratio increased from
2.2 in 1984 to 4.3 in 1985. During the same period, the reported net
income increased from L$502,000 to L$896,000. This was due to lower
provisions for loan losses. Provisions of LS1,411,000 were made in 1984 as
compared to L$l,198,000 in 1985. As a result of the higher reported net
income in 1985, the return on equity increased from 102 in 1984 to 172 in
1985. Administrative expenses increased to L$2.3 million in 1985 from
L$2.0 million in 1984; however, expressed as a percent of total assets,
they declined from 13S to 62 due to the sharp increase in total assets in
1985. The stockholders' equity improved from L$4.831 million in 1984 to
L$5.972 million in 1985. Increase in equity was relatively less compared
to the increase in the risk assets. Consequently, the ratio of *risk
assets' to equity declined from 100s40 to 100:19.
3.11      ACDB was able to attract increased deposits during the period.
Total deposits increased from L$9.399 million in 1984 to L$23.071 million
in 1985, an increase of 145Z. Demand deposits tripled from L$5.945 to
L$19.108 million while savings deposits increased from L$2.791 million to
L$3.130 million and time deposits increased from L$0.662 million to L$0.833
million.
3.12      The bank faced liquidity problems during the project's
implementation period mainly because in the context of Liberia, it is
difficult to convert short-term loans into cash in the short run. Also
claims on the NBL are unlikely to be converted into cash in the short run
because of peculiar shortage of cash in the economy. On the other hand,
short-term obligations represented potential demand for cash in the short
run.
(ii) Liberian Bank for Develolment and Investment
3.13      The LBDI was established in 1965 with the assistance of IFC
which subscribed 25? of the initial L$1.0 million capital. Its share
capital was increased to L$S5.0 million in 1976, of which L$3.6 million was
paid as of December 1978. The Government, IFC and a number of private
Liberians together own 50.4t of LBDI's shares, the remaining being held by
a number of private foreign companies and financial institutions. Under



- 8 -
its charter, LBDI finances productive enterprises in manufacturing,
agriculture, transportation, tourism and services. It can make loans, take
equity participations, issue guarantees and underwrite stock issues. The
World Bank has granted three lines of credit to LBDI since 1972 amounting
to US$12 millLon. Assistance of the Bank Group has enabled LBDI to develop
into a strong and sound financial institution which plays a major role in
financing enterprises of all sizes. LBDI Board. chaired by the Minister of
Finance, consists of eight members representing Liberian interest (3), IFC
(1) and foreign shareholders (4). LBDI is organized into three main
departments: Projects, Finance, and Internal Audit and Control.
3.14      LBDI's investment and financial position were sound at the time
of appraisal.  Its financial performance in the mid-1980s is summarized in
Annex IV. As compared to SEFO and ACDB, LBDI is an experienced and better-
managed bank. However, LBDI was a reluctant participant in the SME Project
due to its access to other sources of foreign exchange (including three
DFC-type loans from the Bank) and disappointment with NBL's handling of
project approvals and disbursements. LBDI's gross revenues declined
slightly between 1984 and 1985, from L$4.6 million to L$4.5 million.
However, reported net profit showed a considerable increase from a negative
L$1.2 million to negative L$0.1 million due to higher provisions made for
loan loses in 1984 compared to 1985.
3.15      The level of stockholders' equity was steady.  Debt to equity
ratio and Orisk assets' to equity ratio were also steady at about 100:17
and 100:20, respectively. 78S of LBDI's total assets in 1984 were in the
form of loans and equity investments. The percentage fell to 762 in 1985.
Long-term debt formed 642 of the long term resources in June 1986. Thus,
some of the current and short-term loans were made out of long-term
borrowings. Short-term borrowings were small. Sources of funds were
basically two: owners' equity and institutional long-term borrowings.
There was hardly any volatility in the quantum of sources.
(iii) Small Enterprises Financing Organization
3.16      SEFO was set up in 1981 with the assistance of the Netherlands
Development Finance Company (FHO) to develop and promote small-scale
enterprises in the country. As of December 31, 1985, paid-up capital was
L$628,601 and the shareholders were FMO (39.82), LBDI (40.6S), Liberia
Finance & Trust Company (3.92). Partnership for Productivity International
(2.2S), ACDB (6.7Z), and National Housing and Savinge Bank (6.82). USAID
provided L$500,000 as capital grant in 1985. SEFO seemed to be well
managed, had recruited some promising Liberian staff and enjoyed support of
the FMO, LBDI and other Liberian institutions. However, it was very
inadequately funded. Its initial share capital was too small and the cost
of a large part of its external resources was very high.
3.17      SEFO's balance sheets, income statements and selected financial
ratios for the period 1984-86 are summarized in Annex V. Its financial
condition is poor. After provisions were made for loan losses, the
shareholders equtity was negative in each of the three years. Operational
losses and loan loss provisions were financed from long term borrowings.



-9-
Equity remained negative even when loan loss provisions were added back,
indicating high operational losses. SEFO has not been able to fully deploy
available resources for lending, portfolio loans form only about 542 of
total assets.
3.18      Atrears Problem.  All the three PFIs that participated in the
project are plagued with arrears problem. The arrears situation as of
September 30, 1986 and June 30, 1988 is presented in Annex VI. About SO,
222 and 23Z of the loan balance was in arrears in the case of SEFO, LBDI
and ACDB, respectively, as of September 30, 1986. In numbers, 47, 9, and
21 of the loans given by SEFO, LBDI and ACDB, respectively, were in arrears
as of the above date. Aging of arrears is also becoming a serious problem.
In value terms, 972, 792 and 891 of the loan arrears owed to SEFO, LBDI and
ACDB, respectively, were six months or more behind the repayment schedule
as of the above date. SEFO had 38 projects in-arrears of six months or
more; LBDI had 3; ACDB had 11. About 402 of the number of subloans under
the SHE Project were in arrears of six months or more, accounting for about
802 of the total amount in arrears. The situation had gotten worse by June
30, 1988. By that date, 47 out of 53, 6 out of 10, and 23 out of 25
subprojects financed through SEFO, LBDI, and ACDB, respectively were in
arrears. The age of arrears ranged from 1-56 months. In the case of ACDB,
all the principal outstanding was in arrears. Further details are given in
Annex VI. Bank supervision missions emphasized the need for the PFIs to
step up their efforts in project supervision and loan recovery. The PPIs
were attempting individually to revive the problem projects through
intensive technical assistance and restructuring of loans.
3.19      An increase in the interest rate spread to the PFIs was thought
necessary to compensate the PFIs for a higher than anticipated loan default
rate arising from the economic recession that is still facing the country.
The spread was increased from 5.52 to 10.752 in October 1986 by reducing
the lending rate from NBL to the PFIs. The PFIs needed to make provisions
for higher than anticipated loan losses.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Obiectives
4.01      The primary objectives of the project were:
(a) to develop an appropriate institution that would provide the
necessary assistance to entrepreneurs in planning and managing
their investments; and
(b) to encourage local financial institutions to increase their
support of local businesses.
Thus, the project was expected to support the Government's efforts to
broaden the industrial base and increase local participation and employment
in industrial activities in Liberia.



- 10 -
4.02      To achieve the above objectives, the project consisted of the
following components:
(a)  Line of Credit (SDR 2.7 million) for the financing of small and
medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) through the PFIs as follows:
Mi)     SDR 0.8 million to small-scale enterprises (SSEs),
wholly owned by Liberians, with total fixed assets not
exceeding L$50,000 at the time of application by the
enterprise for a subloan, and with project investment
costs not exceeding L$50,000; and
(ii)     SDR 1.9 million to medium-scale enterprises (MSEs),
wholly owned by Liberians, with total fixed assets not
exceeding LS100,000 at the time of application by the
enterprise for a subloan, and with project investment
costs not exceeding L$l00,000.
(b)  Technical Assistance to National Investment Commission (SDR
0.310 million) for:
(i)     strengthening of NICs capability to provide effective
promotion and advisory services to SMEs including the
establishment of a project promotion and evaluation
unit within NIC's SME Department and the provision of
extension services to artisans and SMEs;
(ii)     review of the Investment Code to enable, among other
things, SMEs to benefit from the investment incentives
provided under the Investment Code;
(iii)     follow-up of the SHE survey carried out by the
University of Liberia; and
(iv)     provision of necessary technical assistance (TA) to
SMEs.
4.03      The credit component, managed by NBL, was to be onlent to the
PFIs at an interest rate of 9S per annum plus 1S for subloans eligible for
guarantee under NBL's Credit Guarantee Scheme. The maximum maturity of
PPI's subloans would be 10 years, at an interest rate of 13.5 per annum
including the fee for guarantee under the Guarantee Scheme. Interest rates
would be subject to review from time to time. The onlending rate to PFIs
was reduced to 4.75S in October 1986 (para 3.19). Foreign exchange risk
was to be borne by the Government at no fee to sub-borrowers.
4.04      The project was expected to assist about 40 SSEs with individual
loans averaging L$25,000, the bulk of these loans being in the L$5,000 to
$10,000 range, and about 34 MSEs with individual loans averaging L$70,000.
The project was also expected to help generate over L$4.2 million of
investments which in turn would create around 500 jobs at an average cost



- 11 -
of about L$8,000 and below L$5,000 for MSEs and SSEs, respectively. Credit
requests prepared with or without RIC's help would be presented by the
promoter to a PFI of its choice. Credit approval would be the
responsibility of the PFI, subject, however, to NBL's approval and IDA's
approval for refinancing.
B. Proiect Implementation
4.05      Implementation of the project was off to a very slow start.
Because of political events in 1979 and 1980 and ensuing changes in
concerned agencies and personnel, the credit did not become effective until
September 14, 1981, almost a year after Board approval. Very little
progress was made for a period of two years mainly due to organizational
problems at the NBL and NIC, and lack of interest by development and
commercial banks in participating in the project. Much slower c.vnitment
and disbursement rates than appraisal estimates made it necessary to extend
the credit's closing date three times to June 30, 1987.   Annex VII
compares the schedule of estimated and actual cumulative disbursements. By
June 30, 1984, the original closing date, only US$0.59 million (152 of the
total credit) had been disbursed. At the end of the first extended closing
date, June 30, 1985, US$ 1.25 million (312 of total credit) had been
disbursed. By the end of the second revised closing date, December 31,
1986, US$2.11 million (53Z of total credit) had been disbursed. By the
final closing date, June 30, 1987, US$2.84 million (712 of total credit)
had been disbursed. There is still a balance of SDR237,476 in the Special
Accounts to be accounted for. An undisbursed balance in t..e credit account
of SDR620,829 is now in the process of being cancelled.
4.06      Several factors accounted for the slow comiitment and
disbursement of the credit. The NBL did not have the necessary staff or
expertise to initiate the project. It was not until January 1984 when the
NBL established a Project Analysis Department and assigned a full-time
staff to carry out effective implementation of the project. In September
1979, the Government created NIC and dissolved the Liberian Development
Corporation (LDC) which had originally been designated to implement the TA
component. By Credit effectiveness, NIC had not reachec. the operational
level required to implement the SME project. Contrary to the expectations
at appraisal, the financial institutions were reluctant to participate in
the project due to (i) the perceived high risk involved in financing SSEs,
(ii) the slow development of NIC's support services (the new management and
staff of NIC were inexperienced), (iii) the mistrust in the Credit
Guarantee Scheme operated by the NBL (the Scheme established in 1978 had
guaranteed only a few credits), and (iv) NBL's inability to advance
payments under subloans which would be reimbursed by IDA. Given the
deteriorating economic climate in Liberia during the period, commercial and
foreign banks operating in the country were not willing to participate in
the project. Only three financial institutions, LBDI, SEFO and ACDB
participated; LBDI was a reluctant participant (para. 3.±4).
4.07      Project proposal preparation by NIC's SME Department was mostly
behind schedule. Two factors--the non-existence of business records of the
clients who applied for assistance and the length of time it took for



- 12 -
information regarding the enterprise to be extracted from them--contributed
to this. Sometimes it was necessary for extension officers to reconstruct
records before preparation of financial statements could begin, an exercise
which was often very time-consuming. Also, most of the small entrepreneurs
were unable to make even a very modest equity contribution and lacked the
entrepreneurial capabilities, like simple book-keeping techniques, that
would ensure proper administration of their businesses. Many of them had
never had access to bank credit before.
4.08      Implementation of the project was also adversely affected by
undue delays in subproject processing both at the PFIs and at the N8L.
Several factors contributed to such delays: PFIs shortage of experienced
staff able to handle a large number of subprojects, inadequate record-
keeping and documentation by PFIs, cumbersome procedures for approval and
disbursement by the NBL, and practice by the NBL to seek IDA approval of
all subprojects including those below "free limit." Most of these
shortcomings were resolved towards the end of the project implementation
period.
4.09      Commnitment and disbursement of the credit were also slowed down
by two long disbursement suspensions--February to September 1985 and
February to September 1986--that became necessary because Liberia was not
meeting its debt service obligations to the Bank Group. Furthermore,
shortage of their own funds curtailed the ability of LBDI, SEF0 and ACDB to
disburse smoothly against their loans to SMEs, exacerbating the impact of
the suspension of IDA disbursements on the Liberian economy. Continued
economic difficulties made some potential investors postpone investment
decisions reached earlier.
4.10      The NBL had not yet fully understood its role as an apex
institution, often getting bogged down with cumbersome procedures and
debate vis-a-vis the PFIs. In order to solidify trust with PFIs and build
up its role as an apex institution, the NBL needed to strengthen its
capabilities to: assess the eligibility of financial institutions for
participation in apex lending schemes, develop guidelines and criteria for
evaluating the financial performance of PFIs, assist PFIs in upgrading
their project appraisal and supervision systems, and develop guidelines and
--ocedures for subproject processing and loan disbursements. The NBL
.tarted giving priority to strengthening the above functions only towards
the end of the project.
4.11      The system of monitoring initially practiced by the Project
Analysis Department (now Development Finance Department) of the NBL was not
consistent with the role of the NBL as the apex lending institution. The
department, instead of monitoring the qtuality of the loan portfolio of the
PFIs, attempted to monitor the performance of the subprojects which was
basically a function of the PF1.. The PFIs felt that the NBL was
unnecessarily interfering in their operations. Moreover, the NBL did not
have the staff to monitor individual subprojects funded under the project.
The practice was stopped following discussions with an IDA supervision
mission. However, the NBL still maintains that divorcing it completely



- 13 -
from monitoring the performance uf the subprojects did more harm to the
overall performance of the project.
4.12      The Credit Agreement w&s amended on July 22, 1983 to establish a
Special Account from which the NBL could disburse funds in favor of
approved subprojects and later be replenished by IDA upon receipt of
required documents. The Special Account assisted in expediting the flow of
funds to approved subprojects. In light of tight liquidity facing the
PFIs, the NBL also decided in 1986 to make available to each of the three
PPIle L$50OOO, from its own resources, on a revolving basis to enable them
to make di-bursements to tlEe approved subprojects until refinancing was
made available by the NBL from the Special Account under the credit line on
submission of appropriate documents by the PFIs. The scheme seems to have
worked well.
4.13      In the course of project implementation, there seemed to se some
confusion on whether financing working capital was allowed under the
Credit. There was no provision to this effect in the Credit and Project
Agreements and the Borrower requested an amendment to make working capital
financing eligible for the purpose of utilizing idle capacity. Despite the
absence of this provision in the Agreements, many subloans requiring
funding of working capital were approved since 1983. On October 29, 1986
these Agreements were amended to reflect the original intention of
assisting in the provision of working capital as outlined in the SAR.
4.14        During project implementation, there was a realization that
the TA planned for NIC during appraisal was inadequate in relation to NIC's
actual requirements. It was also realized that SEPO, which had not come
into existence at the time of appraisal, also needed TA in project
appraisal and supervision. The TA component was thus expanded in March
1984; it would continue assistance to NIC for project identification/
preparation work but would also include TA to SEFO. The revised TA
component was finally combined with a similar ongoing UNDP project for
providing extension services to small-scale enterprises through NIC. UNIDO
was appointed the implementing agency of the combined UNDPIIDA-funded TA
project since UNIDO staff were already working with NIC's SME Department to
develop extension services. Combining the two programs resulted in
improved project coordination and implementation. USAID also approved a
"Small and Medium Enterprises Development Support Project" implemented by
SEFO over the period 1984-89.
4.15      inadequate coordination between TA and project finance was one
of the causes of delays in the processing of subproject approvals. NIC
invested considerable time and effort in identifying and preparing
subprojects, but most of these seemed to have been found unsuitable for
financing by the PFIs. For example, by July 1984 NRC had prepared and
submitted 80 subprojects to PFIs, but only 20 of them had been approved by
the PFI. The redesigned TA to NIC improved the quality of subprojects
prepared by NIC in the later years of project implementation.
4.16      In the earlier years of project implementation, NIC was able to
provide intensive extension services only to those entrepreneurs whose



- 14 -
projects were prepared by NIC contrary to the objectives of the project.
This was corrected when it was pointed out during IDA supervl,sion missions
that extension services ought to be provided to all entrepreneurs financed
under the project. Some projects received only technical assistance from
NIC.
4.17      Overall, technical assistance appears to have been a useful and
appreciated service to SMEs. The most important elements of NIC's
technical assistance were In connection with the selection of machinery and
training of entrepreneurs in accounting prrcedures.
C. Compliance with Credit Covenants
4.18      While most of the credit covenants were complied with
satisfactorily, others were not met fully. Under the Credit Agreement the
Borrower was required to make adequate annual budgetary appropriations to
NIC to carry out the TA component of the project.   Budgetary
appropriations to NIC were insufficient in most cases mainly due to
financial constraints facing the Government. The NBL was also to furnish
to IRA, not later than six months after the end of NBL's fiscal year,
certified copies of the financial statements and annual audit reports. IDA
did not received such statements and reports for the years 1986 and 1987 in
spite of reminders to NBL. NIC was required to furnish to IDA not later
than six months after the closing date or other agreed date, a report on
the execution of the TA component of the project. The NBL was to prepare a
Project Completion Report within six months following the last withdrawal
from the Credit Account. Both NIC and NBL did not meet their obligations.
NIL was obligated to furnish all such information as IDA shall reasonably
request concerning the credit component of the project. The Borrower was
also required to cause NIC to provide to IDA information concerning the TA
component. The Borrower, NBL and NIC did not respond in time to a request
and a subsequent reminder to furnish to IDA additional information to be
used in preparing the Project Completion Report. Some information was
finally received from the NBL and participating institutions and this has
been reflected in the report.
D. Utilization of the Credit

4.20      Characteristics of Subiroiects.  SDR1.5 million financed a total
of 86 subprojects (L$3.5 million in total investments) compared to 74
subprojects projected in the SAR. Of this amount SDR1.3 million went to 79
(40 projected in the SAR) small-scale enterprises and SDR0.2 million was
for 7 (34 projected in the SAR) medium-scale enterprises for fixed
investments and permanent working capital. The average subloan size was
SDR17,914. A total of 662 jobs were expected to be created at an average
cost per job of approximately L$5,300: 574 jobs at an average of LS5,000
per job for small-scale enterprises and 88 jobs at an average of L$8,000
per job for medium-scale enterprises. About 67Z of the number of
investments and 602 -f the Credit amount was for expansion projects, as
compared to 262 of th. number and 312 of the Credit amount for new
projects. The remaining 72 of the number and 8S of the amount were for
rehabilitation projects. The large majority of investments were located in
and around Monrovia and the Montserrado County, which includes Monrovia.
Annex VIII provides a detailed listing of the projects financed under the
credit.
4.21      Sectorally, there was close to an equal division in the number of
investments for agriculture related industries (292 of total number, 302
of the Credit amount for subloans, SDR451,958) and service industries (282
of total number, 312 of Credit subloans, SDR473,821). The remainder was
divided between wood related industries (212 of the number, 202 of Credit
amount for sub-loans, SDR304,297), agro-industry (152 of the number, for



- 16 -
131 of Credit amount for sub-loans, SDR194,501), and other sectors (61 of
the number and 62 of Credit, SDR91,312). Annex IX provides further details
on the project cost distribution.
4.22      Of the SDR1.8 million approved for 86 subldans SDRO.3 million
remained undisbursed. Another sixteen subloans, totalling SDR408,481, were
approved but no disbursements made. Eight other subloans were cancelled.
4.23      Performance of Subproiects.  The Government of Liberia did not
provide IDA with adequate actual data on subproject performance under this
Credit (see para. 4.18). Back-to-office reports and supervision reports
had to be used to present an idea of the performance of the sub-projects.
4.24      Although project evaluation and analysis were generally prepared
as required by IDA, supervision exercises showed that there were many
deficiencies in the early stage of the sub-project cycle. For example,
common deficiencies in some of SEFO's project proposals included the
followingt the quality of information given in project analysis was
suspect because information was tailored to suit IDA criteria leading to
over- or under-financing; assessment of the projected level of investment
costs for fixed and/or current assets were unrealistic and not based on
competitive quotations from various suppliers; assumptions were made that
equity in the form of existing assets and/or proposed assets were financed
from the owner's resources rather than acquired on credit. which was the
case for some subprojects; distorted demand/sales forecasts were used since
demand/sales projections were based on derived demand; vital assumptions
relating to projected price/cost levels were not carefully examined; a
thorough study of the relevant technology to be used for the project was
not conducted leading to unnecessary increase in debt servicing and large
operating costs resulting from high idle capacity; the use of net income in
relation to repayment of loans, increase in equity and personal consumption
of the borrower was underestimated if not completely ignored; checks on the
character and reputation of the project sponsors were also insufficient.
This resulted in a number of subprojects not performing as expected.
4.25      In January 2, 1985 it was reported that of fifteen subprojects
made by SEFO siz were classified as sick enterprises. SEFO's collection
efficiency worsened from 432 in September 1984 te 27? in December 1984.
The reasons given were liquidity problems, protracted default in debt
servicing, decline in sales orders, large idle capacity, and lack of
resources to buy raw materials. Another report dated October 20, 1986
indicated that NBL had funded nine sick projects in April 1985, which
increased to 19 by December 1985, indicating an increasing trend in
industrial sickness. Although no formal study had been conducted to find
the causative factors, sickness was generally attributed to economic
difficulties, liquidity crises, scarcity and high cost of foreign exchange,
reduction in the purchasing power of people. and low levels of private and
public sector investments. Additionally, it was also noted that after
projects had been approved and disbursements made there was very little
supervision, monitoring and follow-up on these projects by the
participating banks. Inadequate transportation facilities was a
contributing factor to poor supervision practices.



- 17 -
4.26      In a supervision report of April 1986 the following observations
were made for projects on a sector basist for poultry, it seemed Monrovia
had reached market saturation with new enterprises having difficulty
surviving in a very competitive industry. It was recommended that no more
approvals be given for new projects in this sector if they were inside
Monrovia but rather emphasis be placed on rehabilitating existing poultries
by providing technical assistance and working capital financing. In the
wood processing sector inadequate and unreliable sources of electricity to
operate power tonls and weak market conditions were the main problems
facing this industry. Further lending to this sector if the firm was in
the Monrovia area was not recommended. For the service sector, firms were
found to be weak in marketing their services and required more financing
for capital investments and working capital for spare parts. Enterprises
in the rice milling sector seemed to be doing well in terms of their
overall financial condition and profitability. Many firms indicated their
interest in expanding into buying paddy rice and milling their own rice for
sale in addition to providing rice milling services to others.
4.27      Other problems experienced by entrepreneurs related to the
installation and operation of machinery brought about by the unavailability
of spare parts and lack of maintenance services. Considerable delay in the
delivery of raw materials was yet another problem area.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
5.01      Achievement of the project objectives, as outlined in para 4.01,
was mixed. This was really a pilot project to a country which had done
very little, until the time of the credit, to support indigenous
entrepreneurs. While the line of credit and technical assistance provided
under the project helped develop indigenous private sector enterprise in
Liberia, the project fell short of expectations in several areas.
5.02      As a first apex project in the country, Credit 1076 contributed
significantly to institution building of the NBL, NIC and participating
financial institutions. A Project Analysis Department was established in
the NBL to manage the credit component of the project. The institutional
support system provided through NIC forged some complementarity between
industrial extension services and project finance. In the process a number
of schemes were designed or strengthened in the areas of project
identification and promotion, subsector studies to identify investment
priorities, regional surveys to identify potential entrepreneurs and growth
centers, portfolio reviews of PFIs to chart out rehabilitation programs for
problem projects, increased rigor in project appraisal and supervision
systems, and reform of the Credit Guarantee Scheme and industrial
incentives. Technical assistance appeared to have been a useful &nd
appreciated service. The most important elements of NIC's technical
assistance were in connection with the selection of machinery and training
of entrepreneurs in accounting procedures. The Borrower's request and
IDA's approval to expand the technical assistance component of the project



- 18 -
and combine it with an ongoing UNDP project made a significant contribution
to the success of the technical assistance.  By integrating IDA's technical
assistance with ongoing technical assistance programs duplication is
avoided and demand on scarce human resources to implement parallel programs
with similar objectives is reduced.
5.03      The objective of encouraging local financial institutions to
increase their support to local business was partially fulfilled.  Only
three financial institutions (albeit one reluctantly) participated in the
project and none of the commercial and foreign banks operating in Liberia
agreed to participate. It was also only SEFO that demonstrated its
willingness to lend its own generated funds to SMEs.
5.04      The project's economic impact cannot be evaluated without actual
data on the sub-projects performance, net value added and the employment
generated by these sub-projects. The data provided by the Borrower was not
adequate for this kind of evaluation.
5.05      Project performance was poor in a number of areas.  Implement-
ation was untimely and extended almost twice as long as projected at
appraisal. The credit was granted at a time when Liberian institutions
were not ready to operate a relatively complex financing scheme. There was
insufficient local management capabilities, considerable delay in
establishing a key body, the Project Analysis Department at the NBL, and,
when this had finally been set up, it was inadequately staffed due to
budgetary constraints. NIC faced similar problems with staffing also
brought about by the lack of adequate annual appropriations. As a result,
and inspite of three extensions of the closing date, the IDA Credit was not
fully disbursed (SDR620,829 remained undisbursed) and no disbursements were
made for 16 approved subloans. A technical assistance program to
strengthen NIC, NBL and its Credit Guarantee Scheme, and SEFO would have
proved beneficial.
5.06      The poor performance of subprojects in loan repayments was partly
due to the worsening macro-economic environment and inadequate supervision
on the part of the PFIs. Financial condition of the PFIF worsened.
5.07      IDA supervision missions contributed to developing short-range
revised work programs and implementation schedules despite prevailing
problems and constraints. Without these suggestions, performance of the
project could have been much worse. The long general suspensions of
disbursements to Liberia by the Bank Group also contributed to the slow
progress in project implementation.
5.08      The establishment of the Special Account proved very beneficial.
It improved the flow of funds to the Pu1s.
5.09      The experience under the project shows that there is a need to
assess critically the willingness of comercial and development banks to
participate in this type of lending arrangement. Perhaps a slower
disbursement rate would have been projected had it been determined at



- 19 -
appraisal that only three out of eleven potential financial institutions
would participate in the apex scheme.
5.10      While suspension of Bank Group disbursements for non-payment of
earlier loans and credits is necessary, it has a serious impact on ongoing
projects and adds to implementation difficulties and adverse performance.
5.11      The project's achievements, especially in the area of capacity
building, are sustainable if there is an immediate follow-up operation to
solidify the achievements.

Dear Sir:
We acknowledqe receipt of vour letter and copy of vour
Proiect Completion Report on IDA Credit 1076-LBR dated October
18, 1989 and also vour request for comments.
Althouah we find vour report a verv Precise assessment of
the scheme, we would like to make the followinq comments:-
1. Many of the, problems experienced bv the Scheme
could have been avoided if the funds were chanelled
directly to the PFIS, this way there would have been
areater Participation and iudicious use of funds.
2.  Technical assistance in the line of trainina and
loqistics must be considered if this Proaram is to
be continued. Monitorinq of rural proiects is
difficult and expensive, traininq of evaluation and
appraisal staff in the PFIS should also be seriously
considered.
3.  The PFIS experienced a lot of problems in the inter-
pretation of policies. There was a lot of chanqes in
Policy durinc the disbursement period. This affected
many of the subloans and even caused a sponsor to
abandon his approved sub-loans.
4. As much as the foreiqn exchanqe situation has affected
this Proqram, much was not said on same in this report.
80% of ACDB subloans were crushed directly as a result
of the foreicn exchanqe situation which adverselY
affected all the projects.
.../2



ANNEX X
- 3T4of 9
It is acqqested that since the loans were made in
U.S. dollars same should be made available to Projects to
sustain importation of vital inputs.
5. Deterioration in the mocro-economic environment coupled
with reduced purchasinq power and the lack of policy-
based strateqy to promote local production were also
responsible for failure of the projects. The entire
project lacked supervision as the follow-up of loans
were left to the PFIS. Institutional arranqements for
provision of extension services, monitoring of progress
were absent. Another problem was insufficient local
management capabilities at the micro-level. In other
words, most of the project sponsors lacked the technical
and managerial abilities as well as the endurance re-
quired to convert assets into cash over the project life.
Most local businessmen seem to have perference for fast
money making ventures as opposed to term investments.
6. In Summary, a combination of foreign exchanqe scarcity,
unprecedented inflationary trend as a result of the
foreign exchange situation, marketing problems caused by
the lack of a policy-based strateqy to protect and
promote local producers are the main causes of project
failure.
In our opinion, we think the report diagnosed the problems
and we trust that these issues will be considered in future
prorkams.
Very trulu yours,
erome M. Hodqe

U. Se A.
Dear Mr. Nowicki:
Referring to several telexes and other follow-up communications,
we seriously regret the delay in forwarding the information required
to complete the Credit 1076-LBR Project Report. Besides, we have also
received your letter of October 18, 1989, with the attached draft
Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Small and Medium-Scale Enter-
prises Project.
We are also sorry for our inability to forward the requested
information on time. This was due to some breakdown in communications
from our end. Nevertheless, we note with minor exceptions some of the
comments contained in the draft copy of the PCR sent to us. Prior to
finalizing the PCR, however, we would be pleased if you would take care-
ful notice of the followings:
1. That the NBL had in no time second-guessed any matter of
appraisal and supervision of the PFIs as was stated in
para 4:08, page 12;
2. That we are in agreement with para 4:11, page 12, but the
decision (divorcing NBL completely from some ad hoc field
happenings) has done, in our opinion, more harm than good
to the project;
3. And that the name of the Project Analysis Department has now
been changed to Development Finance Department; please note
the change and reflect same within the PCR for consistency
at both ends.
Regarding the delayed documentation coupled with the fact that
the PCR is still in its draft stage, we are forwarding to you the below
listed documents for inclusion and completion of the report.

SUCCESS OF TECUNICAL ASSISTANCE
(IDA CREDIT LINE 1076 - LsR - SFMs PROJECT)
NIC's View
The technical assistance through the credit line was started mid
1981. It was later merged with UNDP/UNIDO Project - SME Development
during 1984 and terminated in November 1987. The main theme of the
combined technical assistance program has been institution building.
The concerned institutions are the National Investment Commission(NIC),
the Small Ehterprise Financing Organization (SEFO) and the Project
Analysis Department (PAD) of the National Bank of Liberia (NBL)
The priority area of the combined international support to the
NIC has been industrial extension service.  By now the Small and Medium
,uterprises Department of the NIC is capable of independently assisting
SMEa in cost estimation, bookkeeping and management. Extension
service in the field of marketing personnel demand and competition is
also being rendered by national personnel trained through the combined
program. In the area of technical extension service, the NIC
technicians have acquired satisfactory know-how to serve metal working
and woodworking enterprises. There was a long delay in recruiting
an industrial enginer, but this has been done with the assistance of
the program; he is currently understudying the international expert
and is expected to operate independently by the end of the current
phase of the UNDP/UNIOD project.
As a result of the combined program, the NIC out work at all
stages pertaining to review of potential investment opportunities,
preparing product identification, area industrial development,
industry todernisation and planning and micro-and acro-eancil'arisation
reports. The basic techniques for entrepreneurship motivation have
also been acquired as a result of the program. The technique for
identification and outlining of policies and programs for promoting
SHEs has also been acquired by local NIC personnel. However due to non
availability of institutional credit facilities, progress in implementa-
tion and evaluation of programs and policies has been slow. Inspite
of various unfavourable external factors affecting the program, the

eoaphsi on-the-job training as we3l as training at reputed institutions
abroad coupled with study tours has made the transfer of knowledge for
promoting healthy SMEs sector to the officers of the NIC a practical
reality.
SEFO's capability in appraisal and supervision of sub-projects
has been achieved. The institution is practically carrying out those
functions on its own.
The progress made towards achieving the objective of developing
Project Appraisal Department (PAD) of the NBL to perform the functions
of an apex lending institution of the Participating Financial Insti-
tutions (PFIa) and appraisal of the performance of the PFIs have been
established. Similarly a strategy for recycling the recoveries
received from the PFIs has been worked out, thanks to the combined
program, its implementation has yet to materialize. The PAD of the
NBL has been geared to take up all such activities and for that SXEs
Pblicy and Executive Committees have been established and have already
started functioning.
In conclusion, it might be stated that the technical assistance
in building up institutions for conceivins, designing, implementing
and evaluating policies and programs has been cost effective and
proven highly beneficial and has served the purpose for which it was
provided. However, the input needs go on changing with changing
pattern and status of development of the SMs. As such international
technical support remains a welcome gesture from our partners in
progress.

THE OPINION OF THE NATIONAL BANK OF LIBERIA AS THE APEX INSTITUTION
ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF THE CREDIT 1076-LBR AND IDA PERFORMANCE
The SME Scheme was concluded and came into effect on January 1, 1981. An
amount of SDR $3.2M ($4.OMM at the time) was earmarked to cover lending and
technical assistance to Small and Medium Enterprises. In late 1983, an initial amount
of $43,717.59 was disbursed directly to SEFO (Small Enterprises Financing Organization)
to finance such enterprises. The lending to SMEs did not come Into full operation
until mid-1984 following the creation of the Development Finance Department (then the
Project Analysis Section).
INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED:
The institutions involved in the overall administration (administrative
techeical and financial) of the scheme are (1) The National Investment Covmission
(NIC); (2) Agricultural and Cooperative Development Bank (ACDB); (3) Liberia Bank
for Development and Investment (LBDI); (4) Small Enterprises Financing Organization
(SEFO); (5) Ministry of Finance; (6) Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs; and
(7) The National Bank of Liberia (NBL).
LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION:
Even though the NBL's Development Finance Department came into operation 1984,
prior efforts were made to have many financial institutions to participate under the
scheme. Only the indigenous institutions ACDB, LBDI, and SEFO, referred to as
Participating Financing Institutions (PPIs) responded positively to participate in
the scheme. It is our opinion that due to the lack of cooperation from the other
financial institutions, the utilization of the funds suffered a set-back. If more
institutions had participated faster utilization would have been realized.

ALLOTZNT AND UTILZATIION:
In 1984, a Yknorandum of Understanding which allocated funds for lending
was effected between the National Bank of Liberia bpd the Participating
Financing Institutions. Under this memorandum, a total aiount of $2,009,000 was
alloted for the PFIs as follows:
PFI          ACDB             LBDI           SEFO
Allotment   $ 470,000        $ 739,000      $ 800,000
At the end of 1984, the PFIs committed a total of $1,175,337.  This depicted
a good start and by the end of 1985, as a result of the PPIs performance, the
amount was re-alloted as follows:
PFI           ACDB              LBDI          SEFO
Allotment    $ 770,000         $ 361,951      $ 877,049.00
The level of participation and response from the PFIs in the first two
years were quite encouraging. The allotment was then increased and/or decreased
In 1986 as follows:
PI              ACDB               LBDI                SEFO
Allotment      $ 1,170.00         $ 638,000          $ 1,277,000
A major !actor consldered in allocating the funds was the level of comit-
ment by each PFI. The table below gives a further picture of the level of commit-
ment on an annual basis.
LEVEL OF COMMITMENT
P"I         1984           1985              1986            1987
ACDB      $ 370,323      $ 667,508         $ 705,691        $ 638,455.17
LBDI        144,747        316,762            316,762         347,751.69
SEFO        660,267        727,477           918,017          867,477.19

It was observed that at the onset of the full operation of the scheme, i.e.
the first two years of NBL's active involvement, the response of the PFIs in sub-
mitting subprojects was enthusiastic and is quite commendable.
However, the ban placed by the World Bank on disbursement to Liberia in 1986
and subsequently in series thereafter greatly hampered the utilization of the credit
line.
Through the technical assistance under the IDA/SME Scheme, the following
achievements were made possible.
1. Procedures for approval were streamlined
2. A uniformed format was developed for presentation of appraisal reports
3. NBL was granted approval limits for subprojects
4. An aaiount was opened to finance SHEs under the scheme
5. Working capital loan financing was made possible
.. An Information system was designed whereby quarterly statements of
disbursement, collection, and delinquent loans were provided by the "FIs.
It is observed that NBL's last approval of certain subprojects in reasonable
amounts prior to the closure of the Credit Line was not honoured.
NIC's performance continues to have a positive impact on the entire project,
particularly enterpreneurs. However, NIC's view as submitted is enclosed.
CONCLUSION
The credit line, while its overall objective of drawing down the fund was
not achieved; nevertheless it has fully served the intended purpose of providing
loanable funds to the SME sector, however, a good amount of the line was
unutilized. In future, it is hoped that such scheme be exempted from subsequent
World Bank country-wide bans.
