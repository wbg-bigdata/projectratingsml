SECOND TROPICAL AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (PRODERITH II)
I. LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFINSA).
Guarantor:          United Mexican States.
Beneficiary:        Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources
(SARH).
Amount:              US$109 million equivalent.
Terms:               Repayment in 15 years, including 3 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Project             The project's main objectives would be to: (a) support
Objectives:          the Government's key objective to alleviate rural poverty
and raise rural incomes; (b) expand the rational
exploitation of Mexico's tropical lowlands using
technologies and administrative and organizational
measures which were successfully developed and replicated
under the first phase project; (c) increase agricultural
productivity and production; (d) improve agricultural
support services; (e) strengthen institutions to ensure
effective coordination of multi-sectoral programs in the
region; and (f) promote greater producer involvement in
operation and maintenance of infrastructure.
Project             The 850,000 ha project would bring about 143,000 ha of
Description:        new land into rainfed crop production and would intensify
crop and livestock production and productivity on
existing areas which currently suffer drainage problems.
To achieve its objectives the project would:
(a) construct drainage and road works; (b) provide
on-farm works; (c) implement soil conservation programs;
(d) strengthen farmer organization, extension and
research services; (e) train technical staff and
producers in the use of improved technology; (f) conduct
studies; (g) provide consultant support in priority
areas; and (h) improve planning and coordination of
regional development programs. The project would be
coordinated as in the first Tropical Agricultural
Development Project (PRODERITH I) by the National Water
Plan Commission in SARE.
Project             The project is estimated to directly benefit about 40,000
Benefits:           families, the majority of whom are in the low income
target group. It would also provide employment
opportunities equivalent to about 25,800 full time jobs,
in addition to benefitting urban populations in the areas
of influence of flood control works and service roads.

Project              The main risks include (a) shortage of counterpart funds
Risks:               and (b) problems of institutional coordination.  Although
the project has been given priority status, the shortage
of counterpart funds is unlikely to be completely
alleviated. However, partial Bank financing of local
costs should help ease the situation and SPP and SARK
have already agreed on 1986 (year 1) budget levels close
to projections proposed at appraisal. Problems of
institutional coordination should also be reduced by the
federal and state level coordination mechanisms already
established under the first phase project.

II. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
Agriculture in the Economy
2.01      Mexico's agricultural sector contributes some 10% of the gross
domestic product, employs about one-third of the country's active labor
force, and contributes approximately 6% to the country's exports. During the
decade of the 1970s agriculture's rate of growth declined significantly to
average 3Z per annum as terms of trade turned against agriculture. Also,
agriculture's share of exports dropped dramatically and imports sharply
increased, and as a result sectoral policies came under review. Agricultural
production again increased in both 1980 and 1981 at an annual rate of about
6.5% at least in part because of a deliberate policy of increasing subsidies
on basic products and inputs under the Government-sponsored Mexican Food
Program (SAM). However, SAM proved too costly, and in 1982, when prices were
allowed to lag behind the high inflation rate of that year, the value of
production experienced a 0.4% negative growth rate.
Present Agricultural Policy
2.02      At the end of 1982, when the current Government took office, there
was an urgent need to reassess and reorient agricultural development
policies. After substantial devaluations, domestic farm-gate prices had
deteriorated in real te Ds. Strong price increases, especially for the basic
commodities, were required if farmers were to maintain and increase
production levels. On the other hand, in order to suppress inflation there
was a need to contain food price increases.  Also, in view of high public
sector deficits, the Government's agricultural subsidy policy needed to be
overhauled.
2.03      The strategy which was developed and outlined in the National
Development Plan for 1983-1988, aims at accelerated agricultural growth. The
policy emphasizes the importance of agriculture in increasing Mexican exports
and guaranteeing farm prices which are consistent with international prices;
the fiscal problem was to be addressed by reducing consumer and producer
subsidies, but due to continued high inflation and reduced incomes progress
in reducing consumer subsidies has been less than expected. Controlled
producer prices for most important crops, including basic staples such as
maize and wheat, have been raised twice-yearly to compensate for inflation
since the beginning of 1983, and are currently at or close to international
levels. As a result, the average annual growth of production of basic
staples has been about 5% in 1983-1984. Input subsidies have been strongly
reduced. Subsidized prices for key inputs (i.e., fertilizer and seeds) are
now only available for rainfed-maize production to small farmers holding less
than 20 ha each. Interest rates on agricultural subloans, which until
recently were fixed and generally negative in real terms, have been made
variable and are to approach positive levels gradually in accordance with a
timetable that forms part of the General Interest Rate Agreement between the
Government and the Bank. Continued adjustments of irrigation water rates are
being made in order to achieve operation and maintenance cost recovery under
a general strategy to improve the use and management of Mexico's water and
soil resources.



2.04      The Government is also taking steps to decentralize planning,
programming and implementation of rural development projects to state and
local levels and to improve interagency coordination. In support of these
initiatives, SARH published the 1985-1988 National Program for Integrated
Rural Development (PRONADRI) which focuses on the poorer segment of the
farming population who have traditionally not received significant support.
Regional Development in the Humid Tropics
2.05      Mexico's humid tropics are located primarily on the Gulf Coast and
in the southeast of the country. Within this area SARH estimates that there
are about 7.5 million ha of unutilized or underutilized land with soils of
moderate-to-good agricultural potential, primarily in the coastal plains.
The rainfall reaches 1,700 mm and falls mainly between June and September.
The high temperatures and humidity lead to serious disease, pest and weed
problems. In addition to these problems, agricultural development in the
region has been constrained by: (a) poor access for inputs and outputs;
(b) regular flooding of lowland areas; (c) high illiteracy rate;
(d) competition for resources from the rapidly developing petroleum industry;
and (e) steady expansion of extensive livestock production.
2.06      Despite operating at a low level of technology, the area produces a
significant proportion of the national crop output. For example, in 1980 it
produced 25Z of the national maize crop, 34% of the rice, 13% of the beans,
65% of the sugar, 25% of the beef, 100% of the cacao, 50% of the coffee, 65%
of the honey, and 25% of the forestry products.
2.07      Systematic studies to determine the technical, social and
administrative constraints limiting development of the lowland tropics began
in 1978. These included the Bank-financed pilot Tropical Agricultural
Development Project, Loan 1553-ME (PRODERITH I). The development strategies
which resulted included: (a) increased crop production through more efficient
and rational use of natural resources; (b) priority development of coastal
plains where low-cost supporting infrastructure could be incorporated into
local rural development schemes; (c) improvement of clean water supplies to
urban areas and reduction of upstream contamination; and (d) development of
river-based hydroelectric schemes. The 1983-1988 National Development Plan
supports these strategies and expansion of the PRODERITH approach in high
potential areas with relatively few drainage problems.
Past Experience with Bank Lending
2.08      In the past ten years (FY75-85), Bank participation in the
agricultural sector amounted to US$2,732 million distributed among 22
projects as follows:



- 5 -
(a)   Irrigation: (Panuco 969-ME), Sinaloa I (970-ME), Rio Fuerte/Sinaloa
II (1706-NE), Bajo Rio Bravo/Bajo Rio San Juan I (1111-NE),
Apatzingan (1858-ME), Ocoroni (1908-NE), and Bajo Rio Bravo/Bajo
Rio San Juan II (2100-ME) - US$539 million;
(b)   Integrated Program for Rural Development PIDER I (1110-ME), II
(1462-ME), and III (2043-ME) and Papaloapan Basin (1053-ME) -
US$431 million;
(c)  Rainfed Agriculture: PLANAT (1945-ME) and San Fernando (2191-ME) -
US$311 million;
(d)   Agricultural Marketing: FIDEC (2262-ME) - US$115 million;
(e)   Agricultural Credit: FIRA V (1217-NE), VI (1569-ME), VII (1891-ME),
VIII (2454-ME), Interim (2610-ME) - US$1,130 million;
(f)   Area Development: Tropical Agriculture PRODERITH I (1553-NE) and
Chiapas Agricultural Development (2526-ME) - US$146 million; and
(g)   Small-scale Agriculture Infrastructure Development (1643-ME) -
US$60 million.
2.09      During the past year, completion reports were issued on two
projects: the Bajo Rio Bravo Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (Loan 1111-ME)
and the PRODERITH I Project (Loan 1553-ME). In general, implementation of
ongoing projects is currently slow because of limited counterpart funds.
This slowness and the fact that the Government's financial control and
reimbursement procedures are cumbersome, had caused disbursements to lag.
The Government, in consultation with the Bank, has reduced the scope of and
cancelled loan funds for some of the ongoing projects and has reviewed the
financial control procedures and introduced some simplification. Recent
stringent stabilization measures contributed to the budgetary problems, which
further slowed down execution of ongoing projects and disbursements.
However, the Bank's implementation of a Special Action Program has eased the
budgetary constraints somewhat and facilitated project implementation.
Experience of PRODERITH I
2.10      The PRODERITH I Project was considered a success by the June 1985
completion report. In the six pilot areas which comprised the
project, the following overall benefits were identified: (a) the crop area
was increased by about 40,000 ha; (b) yields of basic crops rose
significantly e.g., between 1979 and 1983 maiz2 yields in two of the pilot
areas increased about 60% compared to average rainfed district increases in
the same zone of about 20%; (c) drainage infrastructure reduced waterlogging
on about 100,000 ha; (d) the level of farm family participation reached
30-50% in the pilot areas; (e) 32 detailed local development plans were
prepared in close collaboration with the communities themselves; (f) over 950
farmer groups were established for production, marketing and credit purposes;
and (g) about 50 women's groups were formed for small-scale agroindustrial
projects such as poultry units, sheep flocks and bakeries.



- 6 -
2.11      The main reasons for the project's success were: its pilot approach
to testing development strategies, effective and stable project management,
careful local development planning, training and supervision of field staff,
high density extension coverage, and strong support from senior SARH
officials. Despite the successes there were early problems most of -4hich
were resolved during implementation, including: lack of experience with
design, construction and supervision of drainage works in the humid tropics,
poor administrative coordination with other extension agencies, inadequate
monitoring of credit flows, and insufficient attention to marketing
constraints. A detailed discussion of the lessons learned during
implementation of PRODERITH I is given in Annex 11.
III. THE PROJECT
Background and Rationale for Bank Involvement
3.01      The proposed project was prepared by CPNH with assistance from Bank
missions that visited Mexico between January and April 1985. It was
appraised in June 1985, and negotiations took place in Washington, D.C., from
January 27 to January 29, 1986. The Mexican delegation was headed by
representatives from NAFINSA, and included representatives from SARH and the
Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP).
3.02      The rationale for the project stems from the largely positive
experiences of PRODERITH I whose pilot areas were chosen to be representative
of wider areas of expansion. As such they were always seen as precursors to
future investments which SARH currently describes as the phased development
of Mexico's tropical lowlands by the year 2000. SARH has also concluded that
of the many development programs tested in the region, PRODERITH has achieved
the most success and therefore should be the model for future investments.
This is consistent with the Government's and the Bank's focus on providing
more direct productive assistance to poorer farmers in rainfed regions which
have traditionally received only limited support. Continuing Bank
involvement in the program is justified by its high priority, the need to
assist in the consolidation and further refine-aent of the strategies
developed under PRODERITH I, and the shortage of additional financial
resources needed to carry on the development program in the region.
Project Objectives and Description
3.03      The main project objectives would be to:
(a)   alleviate poverty by improving economic conditions of about 40,000
rural families through more efficient utilization of local
resources and provision of improved infrastructure and services;
(b)   expand the rational exploitation of Mexico's tropical lowlands
using technical, administrative and organizational measures
successfully tested under PRODERITH I;
Cc)   increase agricultural productivity and production; and
(d)   strengthen agricultural institutions and promote greater producer
involvement in operation and maintenance of infrastructure.



-7-
The project would draw heavily on the experience of the first phase project
and has been designed in accordance with the Government's 1983-1988 National
Development Plan and 1985-1988 PRONADRI objectives (para. 2.04).
3.04      The project would comprise eight subareas.  Four would be expansion
areas of PRODERITH I pilot projects (Pujal Coy II in Panuco, Centro de Vera
Cruz in Vera Cruz, Zanapa-Tonala in Tabasco, and Oriente de Yucatan in
Yucatan) (Map, IBRD 19197) and one would reestablish the pilot project which
was cancelled in 1983 but now appears to warrant renewed support (Tesechoacan
in Vera Cruz).2/ The remaining areas would be new pilot projects to be
selected from a list to be studied in the first two years of project
implementation. During negotiations, Government provided assurances that it
would complete the feasibility studies of the new pilot areas for Bank
review, approval and selection by December 1987 (para. 4.01(a)).
3.05      Project components would include:
(a)   infrastructure construction in the subproject and pilot areas
(Annex 2) as follows: (i) about 1,500 km of farm service roads to
improve access for inputs and marketing of outputs, about 700 km of
which would be adjacent to drains; (ii) about 700 km of primary,
secondary, and tertiary drains to remove excess surface water and
lower water tables; (iii) about 1,400 supporting structures such as
culverts, fords, and bridges; and (iv) general civil works
including about 109,000 tons of input storage, about 20 silos,
about eight heavy equipment repair and maintenance facilities, and
two office complexes for field staff;
(b)   on-farm land treatment (Annex 2 and Annex 12, Appendix 1) as
follows: (i) about 36,000 ha of field drains, ditches, and land
smoothing; (ii) about 47,500 ha of soil conservation systems
involving contour farming, terracing, grassed waterways,
windbreaks, and conservation tillage; and (iii) about 60,000 ha of
mechanical clearing and major land smoothing;
(c)   purchase of heavy equipment and vehicles for operation and
maintenance of infrastructure (about 120 units) and vehicles for
construction and production operations (Annex 2);
(d)   strengthening of agricultural extension, farmer organizations and
agricultural research serving about 40,000 families on a net area
of about 850,000 ha of potentially productive land (794,000 ha in
the five subproject areas and 56,000 ha in the three new pilot
areas) within a gross geographic area of about 1.2 million ha.
Main investments for extension personnel would include purchase of
about 180 vehicles and 180 motorcycles (Annex 3). Main investments
in research would include minor works to complete facilities begun
under PRODERITH I, purchase of laboratory and mass media equipment
and vehicles, and support of about 195 man-years of research for
the extension program (Annex 4);
2/ The sixth of the PRDDERITH I pilot areas is included for expansion under
the Bank-financed Chiapas Agricultural Development Project
(Loan 2526-ME).



(e)   training in techniques of integrated rural development, rural
communications, producer organization, self management schemes
(e.g., operation and maintenance of infrastructure), drainage and
soil conservation, and production systems-oriented methodology in
crop, livestock, and forestry production. Four types of training
would be offered: formal (480 man-months), in-service (480
man-months), new staff (600 man-months) and for producers (1,500
man-months) (Annex 5);
(f)   studies as follows: (i) complementary studies on the subproject
areas; (ii) detailed studies on the five new pilot areas from which
three would be selected after Bank review for financing; and
(iii) marketing studies for the products to be produced in the
subproject areas (Annex 6); and
(g)   fifteen man-years of consultancies including 8.0 man-years of
expatriate technical assistance in soil conservation and 5.5 man-
years in mass media comimunications. These would extend two
effective ongoing programs (USDA Soil Conservation Service and
FAO) established under PRODERITH I. The balance of 1.5 man-years
would be for short-term local or expatriate consultancies to
resolve specific technical issues as they may arise during
implementation (Annex 7).
Project Execution
3.06      Despite a reorganization of SARH in August 1985 (Annex 8 and
Chart 1), responsibilities for project management would continue largely
along the lines successfully established under PRODERITH I. CPNH through its
Project Coordinating Unit (PRODERITH) would be responsible for overall
project coordination, monitoring and supervision. The executive secretary of
CPNH would continue to chair the Technical Committee, which would comprise
all executing agencies plus the National Rural Credit Bank (BANRURAL), the
Agricultural Trust Fund (FIRA), the National Insurance Company (ANAGSA), the
Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (SHCP) and SPP. During
negotiations, Government provided assurances that CPNH would continue to act
as project coordinator and that the Technical Committee would be maintained
(para. 4.01(b)). Furthermore, in order to ensure that adequate investment
and production credit would be made available from existing sources,
Government also provided assurances that the existing agreement on supply,
coordination and supervision of credit established under PRODERITH I would be
extended to cover the area and implementation period of the project (para.
4.01(c)). A Bank mission visited Mexico in December 1985 to appraise a
Mexico Agricultural Credit - FIRA/FICART Project which will help ensure the
supply of credit to the project area.
3.07      Day-to-day execution of the infrastructure and civil works
activities would be the responsibility of the General Directora:e of
Irrigation and Drainage (DGID). Civil works designs for the first year's
work program have been prepared and tendering would begin before Board
presentation. Research would be executed by the National Institute for
Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Research (INIFAP) and extension services
by separate Regional Centers for Rural Development (RCRD) within SARH's Rural



- 9 -
Development Districts (RDD) (Chart 2).  PRODERITH field offices would operate
as separate RCRD and subproject and pilot area chiefs would report directly
to the RDD chiefs thereby ensuring effective integration with SARH's existing
extension infrastructure. However, the project would require PRODERITH field
staff to do additional work not covered under existing RCRD job descriptions,
such as preparation of local development plans and monitoring and evaluation
of the project. Consequently, SPP and SARH would identify certain staff
positions as -special posts- to ensure that salary levels adequately
compensate staff for this additional work. This review is underway.
Extension services would increase direct support to farmer groupG and
enterprises with the long-term goal not only of increasing production and
farmer income but also of recovering at least part of the cost from the
groups themselves. Training programs which have already been planned in
detail would be provided by PRODERITH with assistance from the Chapingo
Graduate University's extension training center near Vera Cruz (CRECIDATH).
Detailed implementation schedules by component and subproject area are
available in the Technical File, Annex 12.
Project Costs and Financing
3.08      The total project cost is estimated at US$217.5 million excluding
taxes and duties. Foreign exchange is estimated at US$66.1 million or 30% of
total costs. The base cost is estimated at US$178.1 million based on
December 1985 costs. In view of the wide divergence between international
and local inflation rates, all cost tables and financial projections are
presented in US dollars. Physical contingencies (5% of base costs) have been
estimated at the rate of 10% on infrastructure and civil works only. Price
contingencies (17% of base costs) have been estimated at 7.0% for 1986, 7.0%
for 1987, 1.5% for 1988, 7.7% for 1989, 7.6% for 1990, 4.5% for 1991 and 4.5%
for 1992, and have been applied to all components except salaries. No price
contingencies have been applied to the US dollar equivalent value of salaries
since the Government's stated objective is to keep public sector operating
expenditures controlled; between 1982 and 1984 real wages actually fell about
30%. Consequently, real US dollar increases in salaries over the project
period are unlikely. The proposed Bank loan of US$109.0 million would
finance 50X of total costs net of taxes and duties, which is equivalent to
100% of foreign exchange costs (US$66.1 million) plus 28% of local costs
(US$42.9 million). Bank financing of local costs is justified in view of
stringent stabilization measures undertaken by the Government in its efforts
to reduce the deficit, the high poverty level of the project beneficiaries,
and the relatively small foreign exchange component of the project (30% of
total costs). The Government would provide the balance of 50% of project
costs which would be equivalent tc 72% of local costs. The project would
require about 180 man-months of consultant services.
Special Account
3.09      To expedite project implementation, a Special Account would be
established in NAFINSA. Up to US$7.0 million would be deposited by the
Bank in the Special Account, which is equivalent to about four months of peak
loan requirements. The Special Account would be replenished through the
normal reimbursement of project expenditures.



- 10 -
Procurement
3.10      There would be no international competitive bidding (ICB) on
infrastructure and civil works, estimated to cost about US$105 million, due
to the relatively small and dispersed nature of works. However, it is
proposed (except as the Bank shall otherwise agree during implementation) to
package all roads and road drain combinations (US$23.0 million or about 22%
of all wocks under the project) in contracts of not less than US$0.5 million
equivalent for procurement through local competitive bidding procedures (LCB)
in accordance with Bank guidelines. For any civil works over US$1.5 million,
the Bank's prior approval would be required before contracts !'ere awarded.
During negotiations, Government provided assurances that it would agree with
the Bank on bidding and review procedures for all contracts awarded under the
project (para. 4.01(d)).
3.11      Equipment for operation and maintenance of works and laboratory
equipment for research, estimated to cost about US$11 million, would be
procured under ICB procedures In accordance with Bank guidelines. Qualified
domestic manufacturers for the supply of equipment, goods and materials would
receive a margin of preference of 15% or the import duty, whichever is the
lower. The balance of equipment, vehicles, goods, and material contracts
which would comprise large numbers of small items in individual contracts
under US$150,000 equivalent (US$5.0 million) would be procured according to
local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. For any goods
over US$250,000, the Bank's prior approval would be required before contracts
were awarded. Consultants for soil conservation and mass media
communications would be selected in accordance with Bank guidelines. During
negotiations, Government provided assurances that it would follow the
procurement procedures outlined in paras 3.10 and 3.11 (para. 4.01(e)).

Disbursements
3.12      The proceeds of the loan are expected to be disbursed over an
eight-year period, which is based on the profile for similar agricultural
projects in Mexico. The proposed loan would be disbursed mainly against
normal documentation. Purchase of small items and contracts of less than
US$20,000 would be grouped together as far as practical and disbursements
made against statements of expenditure (SOEs). Disbursements for contracts
for buildings and other works costing less than US$150,000 would also be made
against SOEs. All contracts and supporting documents for SOE would be
retained by the executing agency for review by the Bank as required and would
be audited (para. 3.13). Recurrent expenditures would be financed on a
declining basis as follows: year 1, 30%; year 2, 20%; year 3, 10%; years 4
and 5, 5%; thereafter 0%. The project provides for retroactive financing on
infrastructure and purchase of laboratory equipment, not to exceed US$4.0
million for expenditures incurred after July 1, 1985. This would facilitate
the implementation of approved infrastructure and continue the research work
established under PRODERITH I. Project completion is estimated at June 30,
1993.
Accounting and Audits
3.13      Prior to submission to the Bank, all documentation including SOEs
would be subject to the independent review and approval of SPP in accordance
with its established control procedures. SARH would maintain separate
accounts on the project. An audit satisfactory to the Bank would be made of
the accounts and SOEs. Certified copies of these statements would be
submitted to the Bank no later than six months after the close of each fiscal
year. The Borrower would also furnish to the Bank any other pertinent
information concerning these accounts as the Bank shall reasonably request
from time to time.
Monitoring, Evaluation and Progress Reporting
3.14      The Monitoring and Evaluation Group established under the first
project in the PRODERITH project unit in CPNH would continue to operate under
the proposed project. It would monitor progress on project impact and the
status of agricultural development, infrastructure works, research and
extension, training and credit activities in the project area. It would
analyze beneficiary acceptance and response to the development investments in
terms of poverty alleviation, changes in production systems, as well as the
project's environmental and sociological impact. Control areas would be
established in similar agroeconomic areas to permit a valid impact analysis
to be made. An additional responsibility of the Group would be to monitor,
collect, process and analyze information on advances in research, their
relation to the technical assistance offered and the extent to which the
recommendations generated by the research centers are appropriate in
supporting production at farm level (Annex 9).
3.15      The Group's findings would be taken into consideration in the
preparation of each year's work program and budget for the project and would
assist project management in identifying the problems and constraints so that
they could be acted upon in a timely manner. Analysis of adoption rates of
technical packages would also permit management to continually update the



- 12 -
design end content of its extension services. The Group would also prepare
an annual progress report and final completion report for Bank review, using
a similar forma to that developed under PRODERITH I.
Financial and Economic Justification
3.16      The project would remove constraints to agricultural development in
the five subproject areas through drainage and road development. In
addition, by encouraging the adoption of improved production practices, it
would raise agricultural incomes and welfare of about 40,000 rural families,
the majority of whom are in the low income target group (Annex 10). The area
under rainfed cropping would increase by about 143,000 ha primarily at the
expense of extensive livestock production. Although a wide range of crop and
livestock activities are possible in the lowland tropics, the project 'L
expected to have the greatest impact on the following at full development in
Year 16: annual mailze production would increase about 101,000 tons, beans
about 22,000 tons, sorghum about 210,000 tons, soya about 60,000 tons, rice
about 14,000 tons, fruits about 219,000 tons and vegetables about 18,000
tons. Annual output of livestock products resulting primarily from increased
productivity per hectare would increase by about 57 million liters of milk
and 25,000 tons for meat (Annex 10). This incremental production of major
crops would make a significant contribution to import-substitution (food
grains and pulses, feed grains and oilseeds) as well as modest contributions
to exports (cacao and potentially fruit and vegetables). The incremental
value of production at constant 1985 prices of major crops is estimated at
about US$100.0 million per year. Typical farm family 'ncomes are expected to
increase significantly. For example, an ejidatario with 7 ha of mixed annual
and perennial crops is estimated to increase his annual family income from
current levels of about US$1,300 to about US$4,300 by full development
(Annex 10).
3.17      The internal economic rate of return (ERR) of the project is
estimated at 23.3Z (Annex 10) and is based on the incremental value of crop
and livestock production over a 20-year period. Secondary benefits from
drains and roads such as reduced flooding in urban areas and improved access
to markets have not been included although they are likely to be
considerable. The projected changes in land use and cropping patterns follow
closely the investments in basic infrastructure and provision of services.
Economic prices for traded commodities were derived from medium- and
long-term Bank projections adjusted for handling, transport, and, where
appropriate, processing. The calculation includes the costs of three
proposed pilot areas, but no benefits from these areas have been included.
Sensitivity analyses indicate that an increase in total project costs of 20%
would reduce the ERR to 19% and a decrease in project benefits of 20% would
reduce it to 18.2%. The combined effect of these rwo sensitivity tests would
reduce the ERR to 14.5%, and a delay of three years in achieving project
benefits would also reduce the ERR to 14.5%. Switching value tests have been
calculated at three levels of opportunity cost of capital (11%, 15% and 20%),
all of which support the project investment (Annex 10). Thus, the economic
viability of the project is robust in the context of likely alternative
scenarios.

Recovery of Operation and Maintenadd..' Costs
3.18      The two approaches to operatioi and maintenance of infrastructure
(O&M) agreed by SARH at appraisal are defined according to whether they are
large works or small local works. The first refers to larger works which
would benefit many communities (roads, drains and large structures).  For
these SARH would enter into agreements with local organizations such as
multi-ejido unions to provide paid labor to maintain the works. However,
responsibility for this O&M would remain with DGID. The second approach
would introduce an innovation which it is hoped will ultimately lead to
larger scale recovery of O&M costs of certain infrastructure over a wide area
even outside the project. For these smaller works which would benefit
individual communities (access roads and secondary, tertiary and field
drains), SARH would train local groups to carry out the maintenance
themselves. Beginning on an experimental basis on 40,000 ha in the Pujal Coy
II subproject area, SARH would establish small funds to cover the costs of
materials such as seed for grassing of drains and gravel for access roads.
Start-up money for these funds would be provided by the project but over time
(about four years for each group) community contributions would gradually
take over responsibility for the fund's operation. During negotiations,
Government provided assurances that these funds would be established on a
pilot basis (para. 4.01(f)). Preliminary details are given in the Technical
File, Annex 12, Appendix 1.
Marketing
3.19      Incremental production generated by the project would be marketed
primarily in the local area of the coastal plains where considerable deficits
in supply of major crops and livestock products exist. The production
increase in basic foodcrops, feedgrains and oilseeds (maize, beans, rice,
sorghum, soya, sesame and safflower) would also help offset Mexico's imports
in these categories (Annex 10). Incremental fruit production (pineapple,
mango, citrus and papaya) would be consumed in local urban centers and to a
lesser extent by processing industries and small exporters of fresh tropical
fruit. The projected increase in sugar production which is equivalent to
only 2.1% of Mexico's 1984/85 national output, would be consumed locally.
Incremental milk and meat production resulting from increased productivity on
a reduced pasture area would also be consumed locally. Despite
imperfections, existing marketing systems are considered capable of handling
the project's incremental output. In basic crops, the project's construction
program would also help reduce problems of collection and storage. The
project would also continually monitor marketing requirements through the
program of local development planning and the proposed overall marketing
study for the region to be carried out early in project implementation and
updated on a regular basis.



- 14 -
Environmental Impact
3.20      Measures would be taken to protect the environment.  Civil works,
in particular the drainage system, would be designed to: (a) utilize sediment
traps to minimize soil particles from being carried into the permanent
wetlands and lagoons; (b) control the run-off of agricultural fertilizer and
chemicals; and (c) maintain a depth and flow of water in the drains to reduce
the possibility of establishing breeding areas for mosquitos and
water-spawned insects. SARH has already initiated environmental impact
studies in accordance with current legislation. Research would be conducted
to determine fertilizer and chemical application rates and methods compatible
with obtaining optimum yields while protecting the environment from chemical
contamination. Tne extension services would advise farmers on the safe and
proper application and use of fertilizers, chemicals and cultural practices
required to protect the user and the environment. This would also include
the recommendation not to use dangerous chemicals in compliance with Bank
Guidelines on the Selection and Use of Pesticides (OPN 11.01). Cultural
practices would include soil conservation measures, such as terracing,
contour cultivation, windbreaks and incorporation of crop residue into the
soil. These practices would conserve soil and moisture and reduce run-off of
water and soil particles that would otherwise carry fertilizers and chemicals
to areas where they could cause detrimental effects. Furthermore, the
Government is planning to set aside by law an ecological reserve in the Pujal
Coy II subproject area equivalent to 16% (44,000 ha) of the productive area.
Sociological Impact
3.21      With respect to sociological impact, the project would have a major
impact on reducing rural poverty and would also improve the economic status
of women in rural areas (paras. 2.10 and 3.16). Furthermore, the experience
of PRODERITH I has produced a method of analyzing the social environment
through the elaboration of local development plans. The project is also
designed to focus on ejidos and small-holders, who are most likely to take
advantage of drainage and flood control to intensify crop production and
convert grazing land to crop production. Thus, the project would have a
positive impact on the socioeconomic balance within its areas of influence.
In addition, it would increase employment by about 6.7 million man-days per
year, equivalent to about 25,800 full-time jobs, in the areas of Intensified
crop and livestock production, as well as substantial part-time employment
for weed control, harvesting and operation and maintenance of
infrastructure. This would reduce the need for the unemployed and
underemployed to migrate to other areas seeking opportunities for jobs.
Project Risks
3.22      The main risks include (a) shortage of counterpart funds and
(b) problems of institutional coordination. Although the project has been
given priority status, the shortage of counterpart funds is unlikely to be
completely alleviated. However, partial Bank financing of local costs should
help ease the situation and SPP and SARH have already agreed on 1986 (year 1)
budget levels close to projections proposed at appraisal. Problems of
institutional coordination should also be reduced by the feleral and state
level coordination mechanisms already established under the first phase
project.

IV. *SUMMARY OF AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
4.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that Government
would:
(a)   complete the feasibility studies of new pilot areas for Bank
review, approval and selection by December 1987 (para. 3.04);
(b)   retain CPNH as the project coordinator and would continue the
Technical Committee established under PRODERITH I (para. 3.06);
(c)  extend the agreement signed under PRODERITH I to meet the credit
needs of the project areas (para. 3.06);
(d)   agree with the Bank on bidding and review procedures for all
contracts awarded under the project (para. 3.10);
(e)   follow procurement arrangements outlined in paras. 3.10-3.11; and
Cf)   establish local funds for operation and maintenance of small scale
infrastructure on a pilot basis in Pujal Coy II (para. 3.18).
4.02      With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$109.0 million on standard terms for Mexico.

PRODERITH II PROJECT
Infrastructure and On-Farm Development
1.        This annex summarizes key technical aspects of the infrastructure
component: (a) design criteria for roads; (b) design criteria for drains;
(c) seeding to control erosion; (d) organization and management;and
(e) operation and maintenance of works.
Design Criteria for Roads
2.        Of the 1,500 km of farm service roads to be constructed throughout
the area, approximately 1,270 km would be in the five subproject areas and
about 240 km in the pilot areas. Over 40% of the roads would be designed
with drains adjacent to them. Roads would be constructed to SARH standards.
A 4-6 m width and thickness of 0.2 - 0.5 m all-weather gravel surface is
normal for the area. The 6 m wide roads are considered adequate for transfer
to the Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) for maintenance.
Construction of new roads would involve stripping surface soil under
embankment areas to provide for a stable base. Borrow areas would be graded
to minimize shallow standing water and insect-borne health problems.
Suitable borrow materials are available within a reasonable distance in all
subproject and pilot areas. Berms would be constructed between the road
surface and drains when the two are located beside each other.
Design Criteria for Drains
3.        Drains would be required to remove excess surface water and control
the water table. Depths generally would be limited to 1.5 m to avoid
excessive lowering of the water table.  A drain network of about 700 km would
be located to provide the necessary land drainage and minor flood control.
The network would also provide outlets necessary for field drain systems
planned in the on-farm development modules.  Typical dimensions for primary
drains would be 4 m bottom widths, 1.5 m depths, and 2:1 side slopes.
Secondary drains normally would have 1.5 m bottom widths, 1 m depths, and 2:1
side slopes. Collector drain dimensions usually would fall between those of
primary and secondary drains. Side slopes would vary with soil type and
bottom width and depth would vary with hydraulic and hydrologic
requirements. Design capacities have been based on flows obtained from
48-hour duration storms based on five year frequency events except on flat
lands (under 2% land slope) where drainage curve procedures have been used.
4.        Design criteria for drains have also taken PRODERITH I experience
into account, as well as the need to minimize construction costs. Side inlet
facilities would be constructed along the drains to safely lower surface
waters into drains without causing erosion. Sediment traps would be needed
in some drains to control the movement of course grained sediments into
receiving streams, estuaries and lagoons. This practice would also help

Page 2 of 3
reduce the transport of non-soluble chemicals attached to water transported
particles that could cause environmental degradation in receiving bodies of
water. In areas where the potential environmental degradation of receiving
water is critical and where water would flow directly from fields into
channels or field drains, vegetated filter strips would be maintained to help
control sediment and agricultural chemicals.
Seeding
5.        Disturbed areas along roads and drains would be seeded with grass
to control erosion on channel side slopes, berms, and spoil banks as well as
on road side slopes, back slopes, and borrow areas. All infrastructure
contract specifications would include this requirement.
Organization and Management
6.        SARH Legal Department would be responsible for land acquisition for
rights-of-way for the construction of drains, roads, and other civil works
facilities. Approximately 1,280 ha would be acquired by out-right purchase
or easement and SARH would compensate farmers for crop losses. Compensation
for land and crops is included in project costs except for the Pujal Coy II
subproject area which is handled by a special SPP appropriation. SARH's
General Directorate of Irrigation and Drainage (DGID) would design
infrastructure according to usual SARH practices and standards, and would
handle tendering and supervision of construction through its resident
engineering offices. Designs have already been completed for the first
year's work program. Private contractors would carry out the construction.
Adequate contracting experience and capacity are available in and around the
subproject and pilot areas. The estimated infrastructure implementation
schedules are noted in the Technical File, Annex 12 Appendix 1.
7.        During the first year, the Government would begin implementation in
each of the subproject areas and possibly in one of the pilot areas.
Adequate regional, operational, and administrative centers (field offices)
are already established in all subproject areas except Pujal Coy II which
would receive one new center plus staff. According to preliminary studies of
the three proposed pilot areas, cnly one regional operational and
administrative center would need to be established and staffed with the
remaining two requiring only staffing.
Operation and Maintenance
8.        SARH field offices would be responsible for regular periodic
operation and maintenance (O&M) of roads, drains, structures, and other civil
works in the project. The routine maintenance system would be monitored and
evaluated to ensure that critical repair or maintenance items are
prioritized. Maintenance work on infrastructure would be carried out
according to two types of works needed (large or small) and the area



- 25 -
Annex 2
Page 3 of 3
involved. The first type comprising larger infrastructure which would
benefit many communities would be maintained by SARH. However, labor
requirements would be contracted from local ejido unions wherever possible
thereby ensuring their participation in O&M and providing some incremental
income.
9.        The approach for the second type of smaller works which benefit
individual communities would be innovative and hence would be tested first in
the Pujal Coy II subproject area. The objective would be to organize farmer
groups to carry out the simple routine O&M work on sections of roads or
drains which primarily impact their specific community. If successful, this
effort could be expanded. A small community fund would be set up to initiate
the process of self-help for these farmer groups. This is included in total
project costs (US$210,000) and would be used to purchase small tools and
equipment as well as material costs such as gravel and grass seed. Training
of the groups to adequately recognize needs and perform the correct O&M in a
timely manner would be initiated and continued by SARH as needed.

MEXICO
PRODERITH II PROJECT
Extension Services and Producer Organization
A. Background Experience in PRODERITH I
1.        Expansion and strengthening extension services and producer
organizations are considered key elements to introducing technological change
into the traditional agriculture of Mexico's humid tropics. To meet theee
needs, PRODERITH I developed Technical Support Services to Integrated Rural
Developmeat' (SETADRI). This decentralized system operated through locally
based field units and had a strong commitment to work closely with farmers
and their families in order to formulate and execute local development
programs and provide relevant technical advice.
B. The Project
Producer Organizations
2.        In the proposed project, the functions of SETADRI would be
carried by the newly formed Regional Centers for Rural Development (RCRD)
(Chart 2) and would have an increasingly important role in the organization
of producers and the formulation of local development plans. The focus would
be on working within existing local community organizations to permit them to
better organize their marketing needs for inputs, services and outputs. This
would also improve the ability of producers to negotiate more effectively
with suppliers or purchasers and thereby through economies of scale create an
element of competition for middlemen. The RCRD would provide technical
services and would stimulate improved institutional coordination and dialogue
with producers on access to credit, production and marketing facilities, and
social services.
Extension Methodology
3.        Based on existing information on how to improve crop and livestock
production and results to be generated under the project-supported research
program-, in aspects such as improved soil-water management and multiple use
of soils, technical packages would be field-tested and demonstrated at the
farm level. These packages, developed in conjunction with the National
Institute for Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Research (INIAPF) (formerly
INIA, INIP, and INIF) would include cultural practices, such as, improved
seeds, land preparation, timeliness of planting, appropriate use of
fertilizers, insect and disease control measures, establishment and
management of improved pasture, and soil conservation and drainage
techniques. An integral part of the process, which was successfully begun
under PRODERITH I, would be the identification of progressive farmers who



- 27 -
Annex 3
Page 2 of 3
would carry out field demonstrations under supervision of the extension
agents and with technical support from local research staff. The agent would
also arrange for other farmers to attend 'demonstration days" at various
times throughout the growing season. These demonstrations would enable
research results to be quiickly transferred to the farm, as well as provide
feedback to researchers, which is vital to any effective research effort.
When new programs, practices and concepts are being considered, selected
farmers would be brought to the training centers for lectures, seminars and
demonstrations. These farmers, along with the progressive farmers mentioned
above, would be the major means of disseminating technical information and
promoting its adoption.
Field Staff and Extension Coverage
4.        The following table illustrates the relationship between the number
of field staff to the number of producers and to the area of productive land
for each of the five subprojects.

The variation in intensity of extension coverage between subproject areas is
a function of their stage of agricultural development and estimated future
land use potential. The most intensive coverage (1 technician:80 producers
or 1,500 ha) would apply to the reactivated Tesechoacan pilot area. This is
in line with coefficients used in intensive pilot areas in the first
project. Variations in land use (cropland vs. grassland) among the
subprojects would also affect the intensity. For example, in Oriente de
Yucatan this ratio is at 1:8,000 ha since about 90% of the area is devoted to
extensive livestock production.
Organization and Management
5.        As noted in para 2, each subproject area would operate as a
separate Regional Center for Rural Development (RCRD) within SARH's newly
defined Rural Development District (DDR) network (Chart 2).1/ Each RCRD
would be responsible for providing all technical support services. There
would be four Rural Extension and Promotion Units in each RCRD, except for
the reactivated Tesechoacan pilot subproject and the new pilot areas, which
would have one each. All 24 Rural Units would be located in major rural
communities. They would consist of a chief and mid-level interdisciplinary
teams comprising extension technicians and social workers. These Rural
Units, in turn, would receive technical support from subject matter
specialists based in a Support Unit at each RCRD. A Project Director would
head up each RCRD whose principal function would be to coordinate the
activities of the technical teams both internally and with other agencies,
and serve as the main contact to PRODERITH headquarters.
6.        Currently, RCRDs have about 158 staff under contract in the five
subproject areas. However, to promote a higher level of production and
efficiency under the project (including the three new pilot areas) an
additional 137 staff (94 field technicians and 43 subject matter specialists
and other support personnel) would be engaged. The cost over the seven-year
implementation period to cover incremental staffing, vehicles, equipment, and
operating expenditures is shown in the Technical File, Annex 12 Appendix 4
with additional information on extension service operations in Appendix 2.
1/ Pujal Coy II would have two RCRD.

MEXICO
PRODERITH II PROJECT
Agricultural Research
Background
1.        Until August 1985, the agricultural research system in Mexico
consisted of three national research institutes, several parastatals with
overall responsibility for production and marketing of specific commodities,
many educational institutions, state-supported research programs, and private
organizations. The three national institutes, which were dependencies of the
Secretariat of Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH), had country level
responsibility for research on crop production (INIA), livestock production
(INIP) and forestry (INIF). In August 1985, SARH amalgamated these three
institutes into the National Institute for Forestry, Agriculture and
Livestock Research (INIFAP).
A. Accomplishments in Research under PRODERITH I
2.        Under PRODERITH I, the project successfully established the
physical needs (infrastructure and human resources) of research in the humid
tropics. One new integrated research center was built and two others are
still under construction. One new livestock research center was constructed,
two were expanded, and five field stations were rehabilitated. One new
forestry research center was 40% completed and two existing ones were
remodeled. Research staff in the trop'cs increased by 118; 186 man-years of
fellowships were granted; 115 man-years of consulting services were
contracted; and a new Center for Teaching, Training, and Research for the
Development of Agriculture in the Humid Tropics (CRECIDATH) was constructed
in Veracruz.
B. The ?roject
3.        The research component of PRODERITH II would build "rn and exploit
the foundations established under the first project in order to generate,
test, and disseminate technical packages that would increase agricultural
production. Research would be characterized by more of an integrated focus
(crup, livestock, and forestry) with greater emphasis on production systems
at the farm level than was apparent in the first project. The newly
established integrated research center at Huimanguillo, Tabasco would be one
of the main focal points. Special emphasis would also be placed on research
into soil-water management and multiple use of soils. Both commonly grown
and non-traditinal crops, forage and pasture species, and fruits and
vegetables would be incorporated into production systems and studied at the
farm level. Livestock research would focus on production systems based on



- 30 -
Annex 4
Page 2 of 2
pastures and agricultural by-products, animal nutrition, genetic improvement,
reproductive efficiency and animal health. Forestry research would be
oriented towards solving existing regional problems; such as, treatment of
tropical woods, reforestation, disease and insect control, and use of local
materials for fencing. The project would expand the program of validation of
experimental results in producers' fields as a forerunner to the process of
technology transfer through demonstration which would be carried out by the
extension service with help from local research station personnel.
4.        The project would support a total of 195 man-years of research (41
investigators) over seven years throughout the five subareas, thereby
impacting about 850,000 ha. The cost to meet the incremental program for a
seven-year period to cover construction of minor civil works, as well as
purchase of vehicles and laboratory and rural communication equipment,
staffing and operating expenditures is detailed in the Technical File, Annex
12 Appendix 4. Additional details concerning research are available in the
Technical File, Annex 12 Appendix 2.

MEXICO
PRODERITH II PROJECT
Training
A. Accomplishments Under PRODERITH I
1.        Lack of adequately trained personnel was recognized as a constraint
to the development of the humid tropics during preparation and appraisal of
the first project. Consequently, beginning in 1978, PRODERITH organized a
program of intensive training for its own staff and that of other
institutions concerned with development in the humid tropics. Bv completion,
the project had carried out 185 man-years of training for 1,500 extension
workers and had provided 115 matn-years of consultancy services. A training
center was installed in each of three of the PRODERITH field headquarters and
a Center for Teaching, Training, and Research for the Development of
Agriculture in the Humid Tropics (CRECIDATH) was constructed. From 1983
onward these training facilities offered courses and seminars to both
technicians and producers.
B. The Project
Training of Staff
2.        As in the first project, new field staff (about 95) would be
selected only after successfully completing an introductory three-month
training program on the extension needs of the tropics. Particular emphasis
would be given to the PRODERITH approach to extension. The project provides
training for about 200 individuals (600 man-months), which allows for a 50%
attrition rate based on previous experience. Most of the training for a new
staff would be offered at CRECIDATH. In-service training (480 man-months
total or about 2.5 months per technician) would be provided primarily for the
technician-level extension agents and social workers located at the field
units. It would offer staff opportunities to visit other PRODERITH
subproject areas, as well as other institutions participating in the project
to exchange information and experiences on a first-hand basis. Workshops and
seminars on specialized subjects could also be included. There would be
sufficient flexibility in the program to permit technicians with many years
of service to benefit from several training experiences, or to provide more
man-months of training to the newer and lesser experienced staff depending
upon the situation.
3.        A total of 40 man-years equivalent of formal staff training would
be provided for higher-level staff at the Regional Centers concerned with
programming/monitoring, technical support, and administration. Major
emphtasis would be on specialized courses between b to 12 months duration,
rather than on longer-term graduate-degree studics.



- 32 -                        Annex 5
Page 2 of 2
Producer Training
4.        Training for producers would concentrate on aspects related to
producer organizations, improved production techniques, and maintenance of
infrastructure works. Visits to other subproject areas would also be
included. About 6,000 farmers would benefit from the 1,500 man-months of
training in this category.
Other Training
5.        In addition, the project's rural communication system would aim to
reach about 60,000 rural inhabitants. This would involve expanding the
audio-visual system begun under PRODERITH I with FAO support. This system
uses field recorded audio-visual programs to deal with a wide range of
subjects ranging from specific production oriented topics to communitv
organization, public health and education. Current FAO consultant support in
this area would be extended by 5.5 man-years. Additional details including
costs related to all types of training by subproject area are shown in the
Technical File, Annex 12.

MEXICO
PRODERITH II PROJECT
Studies
1.        The special studies required under the project would be prepared by
CPNH and: (a) complement the existing data on the five subproject areas;
(b) study five new pilot areas with a view to selecting three for investment
under the project; and (c) collect market data for the entire project area.
Details are given below.
A. Five Subproject Areas
2.        The studies in support of the existing five subproject areas would
include:
(a)   aerial photography at a scale of 1:20,000 on about 485,000 ha of
coastal plains to permit detailed infrastructure proposals to be
finalized;
(b)   land use studies at a scale of 1:20,000 on the 485,000 ha to
confirm existing cropping patterns and thereby permit a clearer
definition of likely future patterns to be promoted by the
extension services; and
(c)   complementary studies on monitoring and evaluation of drainage
systems and of maintenance performed in the five subproject areas
and three new pilot areas. Details are given in the Technical File
Annex 12 A, Appendix 1.
New Pilot Areas
3.        The studies in support of new pilot areas would include:
(a)   basic feasibility studies on each of the five pilot areas;
(b)   basic studies on about 235,000 ha of the proposed expansion areas
of the three pilot projects finally selected for investment; and
(c)   reconnaissance and basic studies on an additional 250,000 ha in the
humid tropics for future phases of pilot project investment.
Marketing
4.        The marketing studies would specifically analyze transportation,
storage and processing constraints in the five subproject areas. The primary
focus would be on basic crops, fruits, vegetables and cacao. The objective
would be to develop a long term strategy and action plan to improve the
marketing system in the coastal plains of Mexico's humid tropics.

MEXICO
PRODERITH II PROJECT
Consultancies
1.        The project would provide a total of 180 man-months of consultant
support, of which 162 man-months would extend assistance already begun under
PRODERITH I and partially financed as an interim measure under the Chiapas
Agricultural Development Project (Loan 2526-ME). The specific consultancies
would be:
(a)   Soil Conservation and Drainage (96 man-months):  This expatrlate
support would extend the contract awarded to the USDA Soil
Conservation Service under PRODERITH I. The consultancy grew out
of a recommendation made by a Bank supervision mission and has been
particularly successful and its continuation is widely recognized
within SARH as necessary.  It would focus on design and maintenance
of infrastructure including soil conservation and drainage measures
to sustain agricultural development in the humid tropics. Under
the supervision of CPNH, the four-man team would provide assistance
to all subproject and nilot areas and would comprise: a drainage
engineer, plant materials specialist, soil conservationist and
soils specialist.  One key element of the consultancy would be to
continue to build up a cadre of local counterparts capable of
taking over from the consultants upon termination of the contract.
(b)   Mass Media Communications (66 man-months).  This expatriate support
would expand the highLy successful FAO consultancy in rural
communications. The primary objective would be to support the
project's extension services through video, radio and written media
and thereby reduce the unit costs of extension from the relatively
high levels encountered in the first phase-pilot project;
(c)   General Short Term Support (18 man-months).  This local or foreign
support would be provided for short term assistance on specific
technical issues as they might arise during implementation.
Similar short term (1-3 month) consultancies proved particularly
beneficial for livestock and tree crop prohlems encountered in
PRODERITH I.
2.        Selection of all consultants would be subject to prior review by
the Bank and a detailed phasing and cost breakdown is given in the Technical
File, Annex 12 A, Append'x 4.

MEXICO
PRODERITH II PROJECT
Reorganization of SARH, August 1985
1.        The Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources (SARH) was
reorganized in August 1985.1/ as shown in Chart No. 1. This established
the following objectives for SARH:
(a)   SARH central offices in Mexico City would henceforth only have a
normative function. They would no longer have operational
responsibilities in the field;
(b)   SARH state level 'delegations  would be responsible for
coordinating and controlling all operational activities. State
SARIH delegates would continue to report to the recently established
General Coordinator of Delegates in Mexico City;
(c)   The basic operational unit in the field would be the Rural
Development District (formerly Rainfed or Irrigation District);
and
Cd) Each Rural Development District would comprise several Cent,ers for
Rural Development Support which would be responsible for extension
service staff and all official contact between rural communities
and SARH.
2.        The main administrative changes to meet these objectives were:
Ca)   The former Subsecretariats of Livestock and Forestry were
eliminatcd and their functions were absorbed into a new
Subsecretariat of Agriculture, Livestock and Forestry;
Cb)   Fifteen former General Directorates were eliminated;
(c)   One Water Commission was created from the former Commissions of the
Valley of Mexico and Texcoco Lake;
(d)   The former three research institutes for agriculture (INIA),
livestock (INIP) and forestry (INIF) were unified into the new
National Institute for Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock Research
(INIFAP);
(e)   189 new "Rural Development Districts" were created by realignment
of the boundaries of the former 150 Rainfed Districts and 77
Irrigation Districts;
(f)   The Panuco and Papaloapan River Basin Commissions were eliminated;
1/ Diario Oficial de la Federacion- August 23, 1985.



- 36 -
-Annex 8
Page 2 of 2
(g)   The Tropical Agricultural College (CSAT) and the Rio Fuerte and
Grijalva River Commissions were liquidated;
(h)   A study would be carried out on how to relocate about 9,400 staff
from the federal level to the field level. The National Union of
SARH employees is participating in this study;
(i)   3,690 positions were eliminated representing an annual cost saving
of Mex$ 4,200 million (August 1985 prices). This brings the total
reduction in staff during this administration to 19,556 according
to SARH;2/
(j)   An additional Mex$ 3,200 million in other expenditures were cut
from the operating budget according to SARH; and
(k)   SARH claimed that these actions plus cuts in the investment budget
had produced a reduction in the annual budget of Mex$ 60,000
million.
Conclusion
3.        The changes outlined are basically sound and in keeping with a more
streamlined organization which delegates more responsibility to the field
(district) level. Although similar proposals have been discussed in the
past,3/ it appears that economic presures eventually forced a major campaign
to streamline and cut the public sector budget in Mexico. However, the
actual reduction in SARH's operating budget resulting from these changes may
take some time to be realized given the entrenched power structures and union
strength.
4.        Problem areas remain; for example, coordination between the field
personnel under the General Coordination of Delegates Office and the
normative agencies in the Subsecretariat of Agriculture, Forestry and
Livestock is not clearly defined. Also it appears that the Subsecrexiriat of
Hydraulic Infrastructure still retains control for all investment programs at
the district level and linkages with the operational units of the Rural
Development Districts are still unclear. However, despite these aspects
which have still to be defined the change is in line with Government'c policy
of decentralization and needed fine tuning can be expected as experieice
implementing the new scheme is gained.
Impact of September, 1985 Earthquake
5.        In the aftermath of the September earthquake, the Secretary of
Agriculture declared his intension to accelerate the process of
decentralization and reconstruct SARH's large administrative infrastructure
away from Mexico City. The project would support this action since
operational responsibilities would be at the level of the RCRD.
2/ There are approximately 150,000 staff in SARH.

MEXICO
PRODEkITH II PROJECT
Monitoring and Evaluation
1.        A Monitoring and Evaluation Group was formed, with the assistance
of UNDP/FAO, as an irtegral part of PRODERIIH headquarters staff during early
implementation of the first project. This same group would continue to be
responsible for monitoring and evaluating all project components, including
rural and agricultural development, infrastructure works, research and
extension, training of human resources, and credit directly linked to the
project. It would analyze project execution, beneficiary acceptance and
response to the development investment, changes in production systems, as
well as environmental and sociological changes. The group would keep SARH's
management adequately informed, and their findings would be taken into
consideration in the preparation of each year's work program and budget for
the project. The group would also assist project management in identifying
problems and constraints so that they could be acted upon in a timely manner.
2.        The project would intensify the monitoring and evaluation of
selected representative farms and areas within each subproject as models in
order to: (a) monitor and analyze beneficiary participation; (b) determine
beneficiary acceptance of the development program and objectives; and
Cc) measure poverty alleviation and progress in the transition from
traditional livestock and subsistence crop agriculture to intensive
commercial livestock and crop production. An additional aspect of the system
would consist of collecting, processing and analyzing information in order to
establish advances in research, their connection with the extension support
and the extent to which the recommendations generated by the research centers
are appropriate in supporting production at farm level.
3.        Environmental and socioeconomic analyses would also be an essential
part of monitoring and evaluation. Initial environmental analysis would
consist of measurable elements, such as soil erosion, and sedimentation
carried off and deposited in the water courses during the construction
period. In the later production phase, analysis would focus on the watet
quality, including possible chemical contamination of water courses, lagoons
and wetlands, and proper use of agricultural chemicals (including
fertilizers). Social monitoring and analysis would focus on changes in land
tenancy, organization of beneficiariee, employment, and household income,
with particular attention to poverty alleviation.
4.        To achieve the monitoring and evaluation objectives, the formalized
schedule of meetings and reporting requirements, established under the first
project would be expanded. This process begins with ficld unit technicians
meeting once a week with the Program and Monitoring Unit at each Regional

Center to discuss progress, problems and issues related to project
implementation. The technicians are required to complete and submit
specially prepared data sheets to this Unit. The Unit, in turn, submits
monthly reports to the PRODERITH headquarters. Reports on the infrastructure
component are submitted to headquarters on a semester basis, while t-se
concerning research are prepared by the research institutes and submitted
annually. All of the above-mentioned sources of information would be
compiled by the Monitoring and Evaluation Group in PRODERITH's headquarters
for the purpose of analysis, and yearly evaluation of the project, and
preparation of a final completion report.

PRODERITH II PROJECT
Production, Marketing and Analysis
1.        The incremental benefits generated by project investments are taken
from the five subproject areas. No benefits have been claimed from the
proposed three new pilot area3. This annex briefly describes project impact
by analyzing: (a) production changes; (b) impact on marketing of project
output; (c) financial and economic benefits, including sensitivity analyses
aLd switching value tests; and (d) impact on producer incomes. A detailed
presentation of this analysis, including a description of each subproject
area, is given in the Technical File, Annex 12, Appendix 3.
Production Impact by Subproject Area
2.        The overall impact on production by subproject area and by
commodity is given in Tables 1 and 2. Tentative estimates of cropping
pattern changes and yield increases are shown in Tables 3 and 4. All
estimates are based on PRODERITH I results.
Marketing
3.        The variations in climate and other agroecological conditions
within and between the five subproject areas allow the inclusion of a broad
range of crops in the project's development programs. With the exception of
sesame in Pujal Coy II, no new crops have been introduced into the cropping
system which are not already cultivated in significant quantities in
individual subproject areas.
4.        Within the limitations of the data available, analysis of the
existing supply/demand balances shows significant deficits in many crops.
Table 5 compares the supply/demand balances for major crops for the four
coastal zones within which the subproject areas are located with the
incremental output of those crops projected at full development.
5.        There are numerous imperfections in the marketing systems for
different products and significant differences between the subproject areas.
In basic crops, which are destined mainly for consumption in the coastal
areas within which the subprojects lie, the main problems concern the
collection and storage -if products, consequently these are addressed by the
project in its studies and construction programs. In oilseeds and
feedgrains, predominantly in Pujal Coy II, the major users and therefore
markets are in Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon; these processors buy on their own
account, or via intermediaries who buy small quantities and consolidate.
There is a general belief that considerable margins remain with these



- 40 -                         Annex 10
Page 2 of 5
intermediaries, and some efforts are in progress to achieve more market power
especially through the formation of unions of ejidos with emphasis on the
development of storage capacity and the eventual establishment of
agroindustrial processing.
6.        In livestock production, both meat and milk are destined mainly for
domestic consumption in contrast to the northern states of Mexico where live
cattle production is more oriented towards exports. In the complex marketing
chains for cattle, a powerful role is played by intermediaries who have a
privileged access to the points of sale. In milk production, a chain of
intermediaries exists up to the final use by the processing industries in the
major population centers; direct sale for local consumption represents a
relatively small proportion of milk output.
7.        The marketing of fruits and vegetables present specific problems
for small producers. In most cases, they are obliged to sell to
intermediaries, whether the destination is the fresh market or for
processing. The larger-scale processors maintain their own systems of
collection centers and also purchase via intermediaries who frequently buy
the crop unharvested from the farmer.
8.        A modest increase in cacao production in Zanapa-Tonala is assured a
market via the Uniones de Productores and the sole exporter, the Cacao
Commission (CONADECA). The price is set by CONADECA on the basis of world
market prices.
9.        The large increase in cassava production projected for
Zanapa-Tonala is destined for animal feed purposes, since a major objective
of the PRONADRI is to increase pork production and substitute sorghum imports
in balanced feed production. Cassava is not used to any great extent for
human consumption.
Financial, Economic and Sensitivity Analyses
10.       The internal economic rate of return (ERR) of the project is
estimated at 23.3% (Table 6), based on the incremental value of crop and
livestock production over a 20-year period stemming directly from
infrastructural improvements and dissemination of improved technology.
Secondary benefits have not been included although investments in
infrastructure, particularly in drainage and roads, will have a considerable
impact beyond the immediate project beneficiaries.
11.       A range of sensitivity analyses was made, as shown in Table 7.  An
increase in total project costs of 20% reduces the ERR to 19.1%, and a
decrease in project benefits of 20% reduces it to 18.2%; the combined effect
of these two changes reduces the IERR to 14.5%. A delay of three years in



- 41 -
Annex 10
Page 3 of 5
achieving project benefits also reduces the IERR to 14.5%. Switching value
tests were performed on total costs and total benefits at three levels of
opportunity cost of capital (OCC), as shown in Table 6. At a value of OCC of
15%, project benefits would have to be reduced by 31.7% or project costs
increased by 46.4% to equate the IERR with the OCC.
12.       Project beneficiaries are estimated at 37,400 farm families, which
include all the ejidatarios and colonos and a proportion of the private
sector small farmers in the five subproject areas. In addition,
approximately 3,000 families will benefit in the three pilot project areas.
Farm Level Impact
13.       Based on an analysis of six illustrative farm models, the project'b
impact on farm income is considered to be large enough to encourage farmers
to participate. A summary of the findings of this analysis is given below
and details are available in the Technical File (Annex 12, Appendix 3).
Model No. 1: 20 Ha Ejido Annual Crop Farm
14.       This model illustrates a 20 ha ejidatario holding in the Pujal Coy
II subproject area of Tamaulipas. Existing land use is based on rainfed
production of 16 ha of soybeans and 2 ha of maize during the wet summer
season, with 2 ha of unproductive land. In the dry winter season, 4.0 ha of
beans and 4.0 ha of safflower are cultivated on residual moisture. As a
result of the project, parcel drainage and land improvement will allow
cultivation of the entire 20 ha. Yields are estimated to increase from 1.0
to 2.0 t/ha for maize, 0.8 to 1.2 t/ha for soybeans, 0.75 to 0.9 t/ha for
safflower and 0.4 to 0.8 t/ha for beans. The production of tomatoes and
chile will be introduced into the cropping pattern, and by full development
tomatoes would occupy 2.0 ha at a yield of 12 t/ha and chile would occupy 2.0
ha at a yield of 8 t/ha. Investment items include parcel drainage over 18.0
ha and the clearing of the remaining 2.0 ha. The cash flow before financing,
including the value of labor, is estimated to increase from US$1,667
equivalent without the project to US$12,670 with the project at full
development in year 7 (Table 8).
Model No. 2: 12 Ha Private Mixed Cropping Farm
15.       This model illustrates a 12 ha small private holding in the Centro
de Vera Cruz and Tesechoacan subproject areas of Vera Cruz. Existing
land-cse includes 5 ha of mango, 3 ha of papaya and 4 ha of unproductive land
which may unreliably and occasionally produce subsistence crops. With the
project, improved drainage would permit an increase in yields and a reduction
in the area of unproductive land to 1.0 ha. The area under mango is
estimated to increase by 1.0 ha, and 1.5 ha of maize and 0.5 ha of beans
would enter the cropping pattern. The yields of established mango would
increase from 6.0 to 9.0 t/ha while newly established mango would reach 15.0



- 42 -
Annex 10
Page 4 of 5
t/ha at full production. The yield of papaya would increase from 13.0 to
20.0 t/ha, and beans and maize would reach 0.9 and 3.0 t/ha. respectively.
Project investment would include 11.0 ha of parcel drainage, the
incorporation of 3.0 ha into cultivation and the establishment of mango on
1.0 ha. The cash flow before financing, including the value of labor, is
estimated to increase from US$12,575 equivalent without the project to
US$21,971 equivalent by full development in year 9 (Trble 9).
Model No. 3: 7 ha Ejidatario Perennial and Annual Crop Farm
16.       This model illustrates a 7 ha ejidatario holding in the
Zanapa-Tonala subproject area of Tabasco. Existing land use includes 2.5 ha
of maize, 1.0 ha of beans and 1.5 ha of cacao under production. The project
anticipates planting a further 2.0 ha to cacao and an increase in the yields
of the existing cultivated areas as a result of improved drainage. The yield
of maize is estimated to increase from 1.2 to 2.5 t/ha and the yield of beans
from 0.5 to 1.0 v/ha. Cacao already in production would increase from 0.8 to
0.9 t/ha, while newly-planted cacao is estimated to reach 1.0 t/ha at
maturity. Investment requiremants would include parcel drainage on 6.0 ha,
the incorporation of 1.0 ha of previously unproductive land into cultivation,
and the establishment of 2.0 ha of cacao. The cash flow before financing,
including the value of labor, is estimated to increase from US$1,758
equivalent without the pr-ject to US$5,251 equivalent by full development in
year 11 of the project (Table 10).
Model No. 4: 160 Ha _ido Dual-Purpose Livestock Farm
17.       This model illustrates a 160 ha dual-purpose livestock ejido
involving eight ejidatarios in the Centro de Vera Cruz subproject area. The
model includes the purchase of stock, the development/rehabilitation of
pastures and the development of infrastructure. The milk yield would reach
600 liters/ha and the yield of meat 250 kgs liveweight/ha, compared to the
existing yields for the subproject area as a whole of 150 liters/ha and 90
kgs/ha respectively. The annual cash flow before financing, including the
value of labor, is estimated to reach US$47,602 equivalent for the 160 ha
holding by year 7 of the project (Table 11).
Model No. 5: 60 Ha Private Livestock Farm
18.       This model illustrates for Tesechoacan a 60 ha small private
dual-purpose livestock farm to be found in four of the five subproject areas
(excluding Oriente de Yucatan). Project investments would include improved
drainage, rehabilitation of pastures and purchase of equipment and bulls.
Yields of milk are projected to increase from 250 to 650 liters/ha and beef
from 90 to 250 kg liveweight/ha. The annual cash flow before
financing, including the value of labor, is estimated to increase from
US$7,974 equivalent in year 1 to about US$18,516 by year 7 of the project
(Table 12).

Model No. 6: 28 Ha Ejidatario Crop Farm
19.       This model illustrates an ejidatario unit in the Oriente de
Yucatan subproject area. The existing land-use over a gross area of 28 ha is
shifting cultivation employing slash and burn techniques. Of the total 28
ha, 0.5 ha is in fruit and 4.0 ha are cultivated over a two year period with
basic crops (maize, intercropped with calabaza, and beans); the remaining
land is fallow, which allows an average -rest' period of 11.75 years. With
the project, the area under tree crops would increase to 2.5 ha under
irrigation and the area under basic crops would decline to 3.5 ha but
cultivated over a three year period. Consequently the average rest period is
projected to increase to 21.5 years. The yield of maize is projected to
increase from 0.6 to 1.5 t/ha and the yield of beans from 0.4 to 0.8 t/ha.
Mango and citrus yields would increase from 4.0 to 8.0/ha and from 6.0 to
12.0 t/ha, respectively. The annual cash flow before financing, including
the value of labor, is estimated to increase from US$716 equivalent without
the project to US$8,788 equivalent by year 12 of the project (Table 13).

PRODERITH II PROJECT
Lessons Learned from PRODERITH I
Sumary of Benef its
1.        Despite considerable variation between the six pilot areas which
comprised the project, the June 1985 completion report concluded that it was
a success. The following direct benefits were identified: (a) the crop area
was increased by about 40,000 ha; (b) yields of basic crops rose
significantly e.g., between 1979 and 1985 maize yields in two of the pilot
areas increased about 60% compared to average rainfed district increases in
the same zone of about 20%; (c) drainage infrastructue reduced waterlogging
on about 100,000 ha; (d) the level of farm family participation reached
30-50% in the pilot areas; (e) 32 detailed local development plans were
prepared in close collaboration with the communitiea themselves; (f) over 950
farmer gruups were established for production, marketing and credit purposes;
and (g) about 50 women's groups were formed for small-scale agroindustrial
projects such as poultry units, sheep flocks and bakeries. Some of the
indirect benefits identified were: (a) the service benefit of about 390 km of
improved access roads to rural population centers; (b) improved flood
protectin in local urban centers; (c) improved health and education status to
to about 8,000 families who participated in programs coordinated by
PRODERITH; and (d) in two areas there was evidence of reduced or slightly
reversed rural to urban migration.
Reasons for Success
2.        The underlying reasons for the relative success of this project
compared to other multisectoral programs in rainfed areas elsewhere in
Mexico, are summarized below:
(a)  The pilot approach allowed a wide range of strategies and technical
packages for development of the humid tropics to be tested before
committing to large-scale investment;
(b)   Careful planning of local development schemes prior to beginning
investment and service activities ensured strong community
involvement and regular feedback on the various packages being
tested;

Page 2 of 4
(c)   Lack of access to sources of institjtional credit received high
priority through a small credit component. This acted as a
catalyst to make banks, extension services and farmers work
together on the serious problem of arrears faced by many ejidos in
the pilot areas. Significant progress was made in this regard;
(d)   The project placed strong emphasis on maintaining a high caliber of
staff through team training, strong field supervision and
competitive salaries;
(e)   Extension services operated at levels of one technician to 50-100
farmers, which is about three to six times the national average.
Although this permitted much greater contact with farmers, it was
clearly not financially replicable. Consequently, the project
began to test extension approaches using mass media technology and
lower coverage ratios in the expansion areas around the pilot
projects. Multidisciplinary teams were created to prepare the
local development plans and provide intensive technical support to
farmers and extension personnel for a limited period (2-6 months).
After this, the team moved on to a new group of communities and
left behind full time extension agents at a density of about 1:200
farmers. This approach was successful;
Cf)   Project management in the key coordination agency, the National
Water Plan Commission (CPNH) was strong, effective and stable
throughout implementation.  Furthermore the Technical Committee,
comprising all implementing agencies, met frequently and ensured a
responsible planning and decision making process. In the critical
early years of implementation, CPNH also had control over the
project's entire budget;
(g)   SARH's senior management was aware of the project's relatively low
investment cost per hectare (under US$500) and good impact wlhich
ensured strong budget support at a time of restricted local funds;
and
(h)  Effective monitoring and evaluation allowed the project impact to
be quantified, which is not yet the case in similar projects in
Mexico. Consequently, PRODERITH was able to present clearly a
justification for future investments.
Problems Encountered
3.        Despite its overall success, the project did encounter problems
some of which were resolved; others were not. These included:

Annex ll
Page 3 of 4
(a)   The first two pilot areas used to Justify the project at appraisal
failed to identify serious local problems. In Tesechoacan in Vera
Cruz, a regional commission was responsible for all area
development activities. However, it failed to support the pilot
project, and instead put its efforts into the construction of a
major dam. As a result, the pilot project was cancelled in 1983.
This commission was officially disbanded in 1985. The second pilot
project at Zapotal in Tabasco, failed to appreciate the extent of
land tenure problems, credit arrears and farmers' bad experience
with large-scale Government drainage programs. It also suffered
from competition from the rapidly expanding petroleum industry.
However, this situation changed after 1983 when economic recession
hit the petroleum industry and the project picked up again and made
steady progress. The experiences of these two projects were
incorporated into the preparation and early implementation of the
remaining four pilot projects tested in PRODERITH I;
(b)   SARH procedures on design, contracting and supervision of
infrastructure were initially based on experience from arid/semi-
arid irrigated areas which were not appropriate for the humid
tropics and this slowed down implementation. Furthermore, it
became apparent that the construction of on-farm development works
through the credit program was not working. It is now agreed that
these works (field drains, ditches, land smoothing and soil
conservation) need to be included as an integral part of civil
works contracts for secondary drains and land clearing;
(c)  Administrative coordination with individual SAIR rainfed districts
initially proved to be a problem for two reasons: (i) salaries for
PRODERITH staff were higher than for SARH district personnel; and
lii) since PRODERITH field offices often overlapped several rainfed
districts, there was a problem of line of command. The salary
issue has now been partially resolved by placing both under similar
pay scales; however, some problems remain in that PRODERITH
personnel have heavier workloads than district staff and need to be
compensated accordingly. This issue is under review by SARI and
SPP. The line of responsibility issue has also been partially
resolved in that SAlR has reorganized its district boundaries and
PRODERITH subproject field offices now operate within single
districts;

(d)   The original project did not place strong emphasis on marketing and
constraints developed. The proposed second phase project would
considerably strengthen its approach to marketing through studies
and construction of storage facilities; and
(e)   Although the project's credit component focussed attention on the
problems of arrears and the need for institutional coordination, it
did not effectively achieve its primary objective of providing
funds to finance on-farm development works complementary to the
main infrastructure prograa. Consequently, since future civil
works contracts would include on-farm works and an agreement now
exists between the banks and other agencies to meet and discuss
regional credit supply, no credit component is considered necessary
under a second phase project.
