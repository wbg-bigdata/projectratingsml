PROJECT C10iLETION REPORT
BRAZIL.
VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN 1452-BR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
This project, the third Bank-financed loan for the development of
education and training in Brasil, was the first to directly address national
manpower needs  across a  broad spectrum.  It was designed to complement the
first two  operations  in  the  formal system with  asnistance  to nonformal
vocational training at the middle, skilled and semi-skilled levwls. It was
prepared with  Bank  and  ILO  assistance, appraised  in November  1976, and
approved the  eollowing June.  Total costs were estimated at US$ 92.5 million
equivalent, of which 36Z were to be covered through a Bank loan of US$ 32.0
million equivalent and UNDPIILO financing of technical assistance equivalent
to USS 1.5 million.  The Federal Government and the training agencies were to
finance the  balance of project costs.  The project took  nearly 8 years to
complete, two and a half years longer than  expected, and was closed  in June
1985.   Largely  because  of  successive  devaluations of the local currency,
actual project costs at completion were US$ 73.9 million equivalentt an
underrun of 20S. Disbursements continued through January 1986, at vhich tim-
a balance of USS 1.09 million equivalent was cancelled.
Obiectives and Prolect Content
Following the massive  reorganisation of  the national vcatilonal
training system  in the middle 1970., the project was intended to Assist the
Ministry of Labor in coordinating the major public and private vocational
training agencies and enhancing information on training .and employment
opportunities and job placement. The specific objectives, were tos alleviate
manpower shortages by Increasing vo4"tional training opportunities In selected
sub-sectors and geographic areas; expand the national employment information
and placement system; and reduce the Incidence of industrial accidents by
improving occupacional health and safety  programs.   The  agencies supported
under the project Included the National Service for Industrial Apprenticeship
(SENAI), the National Service for Comercial Apprenticeship (SEMAC), the
National Service for Rural Training (SENAR), and the National Foundation for
Occupational Safety, Hygiene and Medicine (FUNDACENTRO).  The content of the
approved  project  included:   construction,  furnishing  and equipping of 19
training centers; equipping of an additional 9 centers; provision of 180
mobile training units; training of instructors and administrators; execution
of studies on the labor market; and specialist assistance for the various
participating  agencies.   A  project  implementation unit was  established
directly under the Secretary General of the Mnilstry of Labor, and some of its
administrative costs were to be covered under the project as well.



- ix -
Implementation Experience
Of the five agencies involved, implementation proceeded according tc
schedule for only the  SENAI sub-project.   FUNDACENTRO  a"d SENAC experienced
serlous revenue shortfalls and consequent delays to implementation of their
sub-projects, while SENAR's weak organizational infrastructure caused a three-
year delay  in the  start-up of  that component.   The most effective agencies
were SENAI and SENAC, those with considerable financial and administrative
independence.
The financial crisis and devaluation of the local currency, which
paradoxically allowed for an increase in project scope, also brought lagging
disbursements and caused the Bank to agree to increase its share of project
costs to 42Z and to open a Special Account to expedite disbursements.    These
two measures essentially allowed the project to proceed as planned. The
Special Account procedure has been incorporated into the subsequent project as
well (La. 2810, approved May 12, 1987).
While by no means problem-free, implementation can be judged as
quite successful given the complexity of the project, the number of agencies
involved, the newness of the implementing unit and its inexperience with Bank-
financed projects, and the declining economic conditions under vhich the
project was   executed.      The  project  unit was  staffed with  compstent
professionals throughout the  execution  phase.    The  stability  of staffing
within the project unit was crucial to the successful implementation of the
project.  The close  and cooperative  relationship with  Bank staff encouraged
the flexibility and foresight needed to effect the changes in the project with
minimal sacrifice to project objectives.    Furthermore,  the  high  degree of
independence of the project unit allowed it to interact directly with the
participating agencies at the regional level and move implementation along in
a fairly expeditious manner.
Results
There were successive and fairly significant changes to project
scope. These revisions, which were crafted with full concurrence of the
Bank, occurred over the course of five amendments and are detailed in
paragraphs 1.6 of the Overview and 3.4 - 3.9 of the main text. Aside from the
deletion of the SENAC hotel training centers, most changes involved Increases
in the numbers of centers built and equipped, mobile units provided, and staff
trained.
Thus, despite delays and changes, the project achieved and even
surpassed many of its objectives, especially with regard to expanding and
improving the  capacities of  the individual  training agencies.   The project
was particularly successful in meeting its physical targets, the building
areas constructed and studeat pz.aces provided often exceeding appraisal
estimates by a wide margin. Together, SENAI and SENAC trained three times the
number of instructors projected. Enrollment targets were also fully met. For
SENAI, significant improvements in vocational training standards were achieved
by introducing new teaching techniques, providing modern equipment and
upgrading instructors. The addition of the mobile units for SENAI proved



-x
especially serendipitous, and the agency's experience in developing, producing
and marketing these units  is worthy  of replication.   Expansion  of training
opportunities, particularly in the agricultural (SENAR) and commercial and
services (SENAC) sectors, took place in the poorer regions of the North,
Northeast and Centerwest, as anticipated. FUNDACENTRO's staff was upgraded,
its headquarters were established with modern laboratories, and interaction
with similar institutions worldwide has been strengthened. The number of
industry-related accidents has also been reduced.
The major  shortfalls  involved   achievement   of   the project's
institutional deve'lopment objectives. The project had only marginal impact on
strengthening the planning and coordination capacities of the individual
agencies and the Ministry of Labor. The objective of transforming SENAR into
a more autonomous agency, with a separate budget and personnel structure,
consisten:ly eluded Bank supervision missions, despite repeated discussions
with the Government.   Such  shortcomings  can  be  attributed  partly  to the
project management arrangements, which allowed for the creation of an enclave
implementation unit existing outside the normal bureaucratic structure, and
partly to project design, which had neglected to define and incorporate the
actions necessary to effect institutional improvements.
Sustainability
Prospects for the sustainability of project benefits are generally
good, particularly in light of the follow-on project, which addresses many of
the weakness of its predecessor.    Structurally,  the  reorganised vocational
training system appears to be functioning more efficiently, even though mueh
remains to be done to improve planning, coordination and management at the
federal level.   The  individual training agencies, and particularly SENAI and
SENAC, currently meet perceived needs for vocational training, as witnessed by
the  high  demand  for  their  courses.   Moreover, both have a high degree of
institutional autonomy vis-a-vis the government, maintain close linkages to
labor markets and employers, and have various self-financing mechanisms, all
of which bode well for their continued vitality and relevance.
Findings and Lessons
The project demonstrated that semi-autonomous, nonformal education
institutions are a viable solutiozi for meeting certain manpower training needs
in Brazil.  The importance of devising cost-effective and sustainable training
schemes was highlighted by the experience with the costly, and ultimately
abandoned, hotel training centers planned for SENAC, as well as the highly
successful, if unanticipated, mobile training centers for SENAI.
The project also demonstrated lessons regarding the organizational
aspects of such  projects  and  the  institutional  autonomy  of the agencies
involved.  Where the  issue is the relationship of the training agency to the
government, independence should be maximized. This was seen most clearly with
SENAR,  a   nAscent   agency   which   lacked  the  necessary  organizational
infrastructure and administrative and financial autonomy to undertake its
obligations  under  the  project.    In  the future, projects should strive to
secure requisite legal status  prior  to  implementation.    They  should also



- xi -
clearly define the implementation responsibilities of each agency, giving
increased responsibility to more established, autonomous agencies.l/
Where the issue is the relationship of the implementing agency to
the regular government structure, institutional autonomy may have drawbacks in
the longer term. In this case, while the autonomy of the project unit
undoubtedly facilitated project execution and may have enhanced management
capabilities at the regional level, it did so at the cost of strengthening
these crucial functions at the federal level. The follow-on project has
addressed both of these organizational issues by restructuring management
responsibilities, giving more authority to both the Manpower Secretariat and
the  individual  agencies,  and  elaborating  specific   measures  to  enhanc
coordination and managiment at all levels, including establishing a detailed
institutional staffing and development plan for each agency.
1/ The Borrower notes that many of the suggestions appearing in the summary
have been incorporated in the follow-on project. See Attachment I.



VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
LOAN 1452-BR
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Overview
I. PROJECT OBJECTIVES AND GENERATION
1.1      Between 1970 and 1975,  Brazil  experienced high rates of economic
growth, which were accompanied by  rapid expansion of employment opportuni-
ties (3.7 percev; annually), such that  by  the end of the period supply of
skilled manpowes could  hardly meet  demand.   Employment increased at an
annual rate of 5.5 percent  in  industry,  ana  4.9 percent in commerce and
services.  Agricultural employment was  much  less  buoyant, growing at an
annual rate of only 1.6 percent;  and  throughout the period there was sub-
stantial migration of labor from rural to urban areas. While the absolute
number of new entrants to the labor force was deemed adequate, their low
skills level placed increasingly serious constraints on economic growth.
1.2      In terms of  human  resources  development,  the following actions
assumed first priority:  (a)  improving  the skills of new workers entering
the labor force, estimated at about  1.2 million annually, one-third in the
North, Northeast and Centerwest regions and two thirds in the South and
Southeast re6ions; (b) increasing the productivity of Brazilian workers;
(c)  training  industrial workers  t.<  meet  industrial  employment growth
demands, estimated at about 220,000 persons per year through 1985;
(d) training tourism, commerce and services personnel to meet tertiary
sector employment growth demands, estimated at about 750,000 new jobs per
year; (e) raising the productivity of farmers by training about 650,000
rural workers per year from 1975 to 1985; (f) expanding the network of the
Ministry of Labor employment agencies; and (g) reducing industrial acci-
dents by implementing compulsory occupational safety training schemes.
1.3     At the time  of project  appraisal  the  following key issues and
problems were identified as being the constraints to achieving the above
human resources development goals:
(a) for the Ministry of Labor: weak capacity of the Manpower
Secretariat to coordinate the overall training system and to
identify vocational training needs;
(b) For industrial training:    (i)  mismatch  in the relationship
between SENAI's output and the market's8 manpower requirements;
(ii) lack of standardization of course content and instruc-
tional methodology; (iii) absence of systematic assessment of
the labor market's    changing  conditions;  and  (iv) lack of
evaluation of the quality of the training systems output;



- 2 -
(c) Yor commercial and services training:   (i) lack of assessment
of the labor market before courses were planned; (ii) little
innovation in training methodology except for pedagogical
enterprises; (iii) lack of systematic follow-up or tracer
studies of graduates; and (iv) limited capacity for training
in hotel and tourism trades;
(d) for rural training:   (i)  very  limited capacity for training
farmers, and (ii) emerging structure for training rural
workers through SENAR (established on March 31, 1976 by Decree
77354) which needed strong support to be able to establish
itself;
(e) for occupational safety and training: (i) high proportion
(about 15 percent or two million persons) of the insured
industrial  work  force  involved   in  1975  in  occupational
accidents; and (ii) loss of time due to accidents of all kinds
amounting to 254 million hours;
(f) for employment services: (i) lack of comparable statistics on
job seekers, vacancies and employment levels; and (ii) lack of
systematlc analysis prior to policy setting with reference to
information and recruitment services to employers as well as
information on trends with regard to training needs, job
creatlon needs and migration.
1.4      These issues determined the objectives  of the project, which were
to: (i) develop the capacity of the Ministry of Labor to perform its func-
tion of guiding the expansion  of  ;he major public and private vocational
training agencies in the country; (ii) increase vocational training oppor-
tunities in selected subsectors and geographical areas; and (iii) expand
the national employment information and placement system and occupational
safety and health programs.
1.5      To achieve these objectives financial assistance was provided for:
(a) construction, furnishing and equipping of vocational training
centers, as follows:

II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Proiect Management
2.1      PRODEHO was established  in  accordance with  paragraphs 5.01 and
5.02 of the  SAR.    PRODEMO's  Director was  directly  responsible to the
Secretary General of the Ministry  of  Labor.    He was authorized to sign
correspondence and checks, approve personnel hiring/firing, etc., indepen-
dently.  (See PCR para. 3.11.)   The high degree of independence of PRODEMO
allowed it to interact directly with  the  agencies at the regional level,
bypassing the central authorities of each. PRODEMO's management maintained
excellent coordination with Bank staff and fulfilled most of its responsi-
bilities adequately.  It did  an excellent job following appropriate proce-
dures in preparing the documentation for bids and awards (PCR para 3.14 and
Annex VI). It could have reduced the volume of bids substantially, had it
coordinated work schedules and packaged groups of items by regions.
2.2      The main drawback to PRODEMO's modus operandi was that by general-
ly bypassing the headquarters staff of the institutions participating in
the project, it achieved immediate project goals at the expense of



- 6 -
institutional development, in that the agencies were offered little oppor-
tunity to  improve  their  man&gement  capacity.    As  an example, SENAI's
National Directorate had to contact PRODEMO when it needed information on
operational progress of any of its regional centers. Also, FUNDACENTRO
had innumerable problems in preparing its disbursement requests, because of
lack of adequate communication with PRODEMO.
Implementation Schedule
2.3      The planned and  actual  implementation  schedule  (PCR, Annex 1),
shows that 7 years and 9 months (from the date of loan signature) were
required to complete the project, two-and-a-half years or almost 502 more
time than estimated at appraisal.    The  causes of delays are explained in
the PCR, paras. 3.2 and  3.3.    One  additional major delay was in SENAC's
civil works component due to local funds shortages and lack of adequate
planning capacity.
Location of Centers
2.4      Most centers are well located.   An example of the very few excep-
tions is the Camacari center (SENAI), which lacks adequate transportation.
2.5      Hotel Training Schools.  The shortage of counterpart funds and the
recession in Tourism activities determined the need to find a less costly
solution to the training program for catering, hotel and tourism sectors.
The Borrower, in agreement with the Bank, decided to delete the three hotel
schools (which were supposed to become self-financed operations) in favor
of building more modest training centres, with reduced operational costs.
Equipment
2.6      Equipment selection was  asaisted  by  consultants  and in global
terms was very good (see para 3.21(g) of the PCR), allowing the transfer of
technology to firms. In some cases the equipment is still underutilized,
as at FUNDACENTRO's video-cassette production unit.
Mobile Units
2.7      The concept of mobile  units  refers  to mobile training capacity;
that is, to various means of bringing training capacity to large numbers of
small concentrations of demand.    To  do  so  effectively, also requires a
great deal of  flexibility  in  the  training  conferred.   The concept was
applied quite differently in the SENAI and SENAR components of the loan.
SENAI's mobile units are of the conventional sort, where instructors and
complete training equipment move around together in vehicles designed to be
the training milieu; they are explained in paras. 3-17.-3.18 of the PCR.
The Units were designed by SENAI in a pilot stage, and built in Brazil at
competitive prices, they provide a flexible operating modality according to
the needs of local firms. In addition, SENAI established within the organ-
ization, a specific structure to plan, organize and manage the use of the
mobile units, at both central and decentralized levels. Planning of acti-
vities was done in close collaboration with industries. They are a success
story worthy of replication.



7
2.8      SENAR's mobile activity  was  not conventional ("mobile actions");
it involved the creotion  of  Manpower Training Centers/Agenciesland mobile
units (PCR, para. 3.25).  SENAR  is  organized into Delegacias which super-
vise Training Centers and Agencies from which training sessions are
organized at local farms, trainers and equipment are transported to these
centers and farms in pick-up trucks. Though the concept is valid, politic-
al interference, lack of trained staff, lack of funds for purchases of
essential items (fuel) or to provide  per diems for trainers, have all con-
tributed to poor results in  this  component.   In addition, the failure to
vary training materials and equipment according to the very different needs
of agricultural areas has hindered even further the ability of the coordi-
nators, instructors and other staff to provide adequate training to the
local farming communities. A specific structure to manage the use of the
mobile units, as was the case for SEN&I, would have significantly improved
their implementation.
Technical Assistance and Personnel Training
2.9      This component was  funded  in  part  by  UNDPIILO  for a total of
US$1,500,000.   The  various  components  are  described  in  detail in PCR
paras. 3.30 through 3.36 and Annexes IV and V. Training of Instructors,
Specialists and Administracive Staff is described in PCR para. 3.26 and
Annex III.
Compliance with Covenants
2.10     SENAR was  in  non-compliance  with  dated  covenants  for several
years. OED's Report of 1982 (Ope.ational Policy Review-Compliance with
Loan Covenants)    leading  the  change  towards  fewer  and  less specific
covenants, utilized this project as a case stuay. The expectations for the
SENAR component were overly optimistic specifically with reference to dated
covenants on detailed training programs and recruitment of qualified staff.
However, in the context of  the  overall project major changes requested by
the Government were successfully incorporated into the revisions introduced
periodically in the Loan Agreement.    (PCR  para. 6.4 and Overview's basic
data sheets iv, v, and vi.)
Borrower Performance
2.11     The agencies' performance was  uneven,  varying according to their
internal structure, and also according to the current severity of the
economic crisis and the resulting shortfall in Government counterpart
funds. PRODEMO's stability of staff from inception through completion of
the project greatly enhanced continuity and communications with the Bank.
See PCR paras. 5.1 through 5.7.
2.12     Major restrtctturing of  the  Ministry  of  Labor,  aimed  at more
effective coordinatioa of the several manpower training agencies, was
achieved in the following areas:    (a) participation of representatives of
other ministries, in the discussions leading to major decisions in the
areat of planning, finance, vocational training and technical education,
contributed to delineate areas of responsibility and reduce overlapping of



training programs; (b) participation and intervention of representatives of
other public and private agencies through the Federal Council of Manpower;
and (c) establishment of procedures to stimulate private financing of
training (deduction of training costs from income tax, partial exemption of
levy payment).
2.13     PRODEMO's progress  reporting  was  comprehensive.  Because of the
accuracy and re3lability of data in these reports, reporting requirements
were reduced from a quarterly to a semi-annual basis.
Bank Performance
2.14     The appraisal team modified the originally proposed scope and cost
of the Project (PCR para 2.2 through 2.12) because of financial constraints
as then perceived. Yet the full extent of the financial problem which
Brazil would experience during the implementation period could not have
been anticipated. The Bank's performance on the whole may be considered
satisfactory. Good communication with PRODEMO and well planned supervision
missions were the key factors in resolving difficulties as they arose.
2.15     Flexibility was stressed in  the  assessment and approval of major
changes in project components: i.e., replacement of SENAC's hotel training
schools with cheaper training centers and replacement of SENAR's mobile
units with the mobile  action  concept.    The fifteen supervision missions
provided considerable technical assistance, particularly on bidding proce-
dures, planning, costing, project management and staffing, coordination,
instructors' training, organization of the fellowship programs, terms of
reference for and follow-up on the diffarent studies, equipment lists and
specifications, and mobile unit design and utilization.
2.16     The main weakness i1 the  Bank's  performance was the overly opti-
mistic assessment of SENAR's capacity to implement large scale activities
given its newness, lack of staff and infsppropriate structure. These short-
comings were compounded by the fact that insufficient annual budgets were
allocated to this entity.   The  Bank was not able to gain aemi-autonomous
status for the agency during the life of the project, a prerequisite to its
effectiveness.
2.17     The inclusion of this project in the Special Action Program during
1983 allowed for an increase in Bank financing of Category 1 expenditures
from 351 to 57%, which was a decisive factor in the achievement of project
objectives during the time remaining for its execution (from October 4,
1983 to June 30, 1985).   In  addition,  the opening of the special account
(amendment of December 4, 1982) expedited reimbursements, though, if it had
been activated mcre expeditiously, disbursements during the last two years
of execution could have progressed even faster.
III. PROJECT COST. FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS
3.1      Total  project  costs  were  estimated  at  appraisal  at  US$92.5
million. Actual project costs expressed in US Dollars amounted to US$ 73.9
million, which is 201 below the appraisal estimate. Most physical objec-
tives of the project were, however, attained at this lower than expected



- 9 -
cost in US$ terms. (See table No. 1 below). In the case of SENAC, the very
expensive hotel schools (US$600/square meter), with lower enrollment capa-
city, were dropped in favor of lower cost training centers (US$250/square
meter), with higher enrollment capacity; therefore comparisons of cost or
enrollment data are not applicable. On the other hand the actual costs for
technical assistance, research, teaching materials, and administration
exceeded appraisal estimates by a wide margin.
3.2      Total area constructed exceeds  appraisal  estimates by about 342,
and in US$ equivalent terms at about 322 less cost. The main cause of the
reduction in costs in US Dollar terms is the devaluation of the Cruzeiro,
which proceeded faster than inflation in the construction industry. An
additional factor is SENAI's two year delay in requesting reimbursement o£
its expenditures, which were reimbursed at the Cruzeiro rate in effect at
the time of reimbursement. On the other hand, technical assistance costs
payable in US$ increased due to the expansion of the component and by
virtue of being unaffected by the local currency fluctuations.

3.3      Overall costs were also influenced  by  the delays in execution of
the project, and subsequent loan amendments that provided for replacement
of some components ani inclusion of additional school units, mobile units,
fellowships, research projects (PCR  para  3.3).   Contingencies were over-
estimated at appraisal and never fully utilized, which compounded with the
accelerated devaluations of the local currency during implementation, had
the overall effect of lowering project costs considerably in US Dollar
terms (PCR paras. 4.2-4.3)
3.4      At appraisal, the  Bank  loan  of  US$32  million  was expected to
finance 35K of total project  costs  (US$92.5  million).   In early 1983 it
became clear that the severe shortage of counterpart funds due to the
country's economic difficulties *->uld seriously jeopardize the completion
of the project. As part of the Special Action Program, with the Amendment
of October 4, 1983, World Bank financing increased for Category 1 (civil
works, furniture, staff training, research, teaching materials and profes-
sional services) from 35X to 572; and for Category 2 (equipment) locally
manufactured goods only, from 26X to  73Z.    Within the same amendment the
total project cost was revised to US$76.4 million and the Bank's portion
remained unchanged, thus increasing Bank financing to 42X. Actual project
costs were slightly lower than the revised estimate at US$73.9 million, but
the participation rates remained unchanged as shown in table 2 below (PCR
para 4.4 through 4.6).

3.5      The changes in  the  levels  of  Bank  financing  coupled with the
opening of the Special Account expedited disbursements and were the key
elements in the achievement of project objectives before the revised
closing date. It must be noted that during the first six years of imple-
mentation 502 of the loan was disbursed, while in the remaining two years
48Z of the loan was disbursed. The remaining balance of US$1.1 million was
cancelled on February 12, 1986.
3.6      Disbursements were slower  than  anticipated  mainly  due tos(a) a
delay of seven months between  signing  and effectiveness; (b) tho economic
crisis and reduction in the availability of counterpart funds requiring the
replacement and/or modification of several project components; and (c)
SENAI having completed a large portion of its construction program without
requesting reimbursement for any of the expenditures incurred. The time
lag on average was about t':o years in the early years of implementation.



- 11 -
Had the Bank activated the Special Account sooner, it could have been
feasible for disbursements to proceed at a faster pace. The Borrower PCR
para. 6.13(b) also considers the ceiling of the Special Account a factor in
the delay. Estimated and actual disbursements are shown graphically In PCR
Annex 1 and in tabular form in 'Basic Data."
IV. PROJECT BENEFITS - CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
4.1      Most project benefits were expected  to result from (i) developing
the capacity of the Ministry of Labor; (i) increasing vocational training
opportunities in selected subsectors and geographical areas; and (Wii)
expanding the  nationa£  employment  information  anlA  placement system and
occupational safety and health programs.
4.2      The project had only a marginal impact on strengthening the plan-
ning and coordination capability of the Ministry of Labor, and much remains
to be done in this area.   A  subsystem to collect statistical data was set
up in the Manpower Secretariat of the Ministry of Labor. Based On this
data the training agencies carried out several follow-up studies which
provided instruction for setting policies and formulation of annual plans.
But this subsystem still needs to be strengthened.The main achievement of
this project was the construction of a number of training centers both for
SENAI and SENAC, covering a wide geographical area. The availability of
student places increased accordingly and annual enrollment targets estab-
lished at appraisal were fully met (PCR, para. 3.10, Table 2). Expansion
of capacity, particularly in the agricultural (SENAR), and commercial and
services fields (SENAC) took place mainly in the poorer states (in the
North, Northeast, and  Centerwest)  (PCR  para.  6.6).   On the qualitative
side, the project contributed significantly to Improvement of vocational
training standards by introducing now teaching techniques, providing more
technologically up-to-date equipment and upgrading instructors' skills
(PCR, paras. 3.21, 3.26 and 3.31).
4.3      FUNDACENTRO's staff were successfully  upgraded (PCR, para. 3.35).
The fellowships program enabled stsff to receive advanced training in
occupational safety and medicine, thus greatly improving the content.1
Quality and effectiveness of the training programs designed by the institu-
tions. Its headquarters wers established in Sao Paulo, and equipped with
modern laboratories (PCR, para  3.13).    In addition, FUNDACENTRO plans to
continue upgrading its personnel through interaetion with other sm4ilar
institutions in Latin America and Europe (PCR, part. 3.24).
4.4      Some important lessons were  learned  during the implementation of
this project (PCR, para 6.13 and 6.14):
(a) the Implementation schedule was optimistically forecasted over a
period of 5 years.    The  experience  showed a much longer period
(para. 2.3), thus showing the need to be more realistic at
appraisal.  However, in  this  particular  case it would have been
I/  The Borrower notes that this was one of the basic goals of the Project.
See Attachment II.



- 12 -
impossible to predict the ensuing economic recession of the
country, affecting se7erely the availability of counterpart funds.
In addition, this project was the first of its kind in Brazil,
thus there was no previous comparable experience.
(b)  the semi-autonomous agencies  (SENAI  and  SENAC) were much better
able to implement their components than those depending on the
Government  for  their  budget  (SENAR,  FUNDACENTRO,  SINE, SMO).
SENAI was the most successful in absolute terms, and its experi-
ence in developing, producing and marketing mobile units should be
disseminated as an example in other Latin American countries (PCR,
paras. 3.17 and 3.18);
(c) SENAR, a government agency, which was at an embryonic stage of
development at the  time  of  project  preparation,  was unable to
initiate operations as expeditiously as was planned. Its lack of
autonomy crippled  its  development  from  inception.    Unless it
becomes a semi-autonomous agency, with a separate budget and
personnel structure, it cannot achieve the operational outcomes
expected at the time of appraisal for this project (and which were
not achieved under this project) (PCR, para. 5.4); and
(d)  continuity of staff within t   Project Unit was very important for
the successful implementation of the project (PCR, paras. 3.11
through 3.15). At the time of appraisal PRODEMO was set -up with
the sole aim of ensuring good project implementation. This it
did, very well, in difficult  circumstances.   one cost is that it
did not become much involved with the headquarters of the execut-
ing agencies and thus did not help them strengthen their imple-
mentation capacity.
4.5      Based on tha  above  lessons  and  because  the  agencies are more
mature, a different implementation system was introduced in the new proj-
ect. To assist the implementing agencies to develop their managerial
skills a major shift of implementation responsibilities has been included
in project design.    Project Management  Teams  have  been set-up in each
agency to implement subproject execution. Monitoring and evaluation of the
various components pertaining to each agency is to be executed in a
decentralized fashion. The Project coordination Unit within SMO has over-
all responsibility for coordinating project execution through the National
Directorate of each agency. A Special Account has been set-up to facili-
tate disbursements; SEMAI, SEN&C and SMO have direct access to it.

PRODEMO - MANPOWER DEVELOPHENT PROGRAM FINAL PROJECT REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.1      The structure of vocational  training in Brazil underwent signifi-
cant changes beginning in 1974.   The  Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare
was divided into two ministries; the Ministry of Labor was given responsi-
bility for meeting the requirements of the country's labor market, espe-
cially as concerns manpower training, employment and wage policies, and
employment protection.  In the   area of vocational training the need arose
for planning and coordination of training activities throughout the
country.
.1.2     At the time the main agencies with vocational training programs in
Brazil were SENAI (National Service for Industrial Apprenticeship) and
SENAC (National Service for Commercial Apprenticeship), affiliated with the
Ministry of Education and Culture; PIPMO (Intensive Program for Manpower
Training), also in the Ministry of Education and Culture; and a few reli-
gious agencies and private firms which were providing training primarily
for the purposes of administration and management. Also about 350 indus-
trial and commercial enterprises were involved in training programs.
1.3      The legal document providing for the establishment of the Ministry
of Labor (Decree 6036 of May 1, 1974) stipulated that SENAI and SENAC
would be attached to the new ministry.   With its new functional  organiza-
tion, the Secretariats of Manpower, Employment and Wages, and Labor
Relations were created within the Ministry of Labor. The Secretariat of
Manpower was made responsible for the coordination of vocational training
activities in the  country.       On  December  12  of  the same year, PIPMO
(Intensive Maipower Training Program) of the Ministry of Education and
Culture was transferred to the Ministry of Labor (Decree 75081 of December
12, 1974), within the purview of the Secretariat of Manpower.
1.4      In 1975  studies  and  research were  undertaken  by the Manpower
Secretariat of the Ministry of Labor to identify the capacity of Brazilian
firms to participate in the national training program with the objective of
upgrading manpower resources. The studies identified the firms, activities
in vocat4.onal training and training needs. This provided an adequate basis
for subm; Aion to the National Congress of a draft law authorizing enter-
prises financing their own training activities a deduction from taxable
profit, for income tax purposes, of twice their expenditure on training
previously approved by the Ministry of Labor. The draft bill, approved by
the National Congress,  was  ratified  by    the  President of the Republic
through Law 6297 of December 15, 1975.
1.5      During  1975  several  studies  were  undertaken  to  analyze  the
problems of rural training (approximately 20 million workers). As a result,
SENAR (National Service for Rural Training) was established on March 31,
1976 by Decree 77354.   It was  intended  to support the implementation of



- 16 _
large-scale projects in agriculture and livestock, especially in the North
and Northeast; the modernization of agriculture with the development of
inr.nsive crops (soybeans, sorghum, wheat etc.); the establishment of
PROALCOOL; the improvement of traditional crops (coffee, cotton, cereals,
etc.); and the implementation of the Land Statute with the distribution of
land by INCRA and consequently the number of rural properties, which was
given the following functionsi
(a) To organize and administer programs of rural vocational training
throughout the country, directly or in collaboration with public
bodies and agencies or with the private sector;
(b) To establish suitable methodologies for rural vocational training;
(c)  To    produce    and      disseminate    instructional    materials
suitable for the training of rural workers;
(d)  To    organize    and    publish    documentation    relating   to
rural vocational craining;
(f)  To  assist  agricultural   enterprises   in  the  preparation  and
implementation of vocational training programs for their employees
at all levels; and
(g)  To  cooperate with   Brazilian   and  international  agencies  in
activities related to rural vocational training.
1.6      The administrative actions indicated  and defined by the Brazilian
Government through the Ministry of Labor, it connection with vocational
training, brought about the need for the coordination of such activities
with the establishment of mechanisms for setting priorities and goals, in
line with the objectives of the Second National Development Plan. Decree
77362 of April 1, 1976 set up the National Manpower Training System within
the Ministry of Labor, as the coordinating and supervising body for voca-
tional training activities in Brazil. Article 3 of the same Decree trans-
formed the Advisory Council on    Manpower,  a  body attached to the former
National Manpower Department (DNMO), into the Federal Manpower Council
which was given "the functions of inter alia, formulating regulations and
guidelines on the national policy of vocational education, approving the
projects referred to in Article 1 of Law 6297 of December 15, 1975, and
proposing incentive and development measures aimed at the professional
advancement of workers.'
1.7      The Federal  Manpower  Council  was  established  by  order of the
Ministry of Labor, comprising representatives of the Ministry itself, with
the Secretary   of  Manpower  serving  as  chairman; representatives of the
Ministries  of  Education,    Planning,  and  Finance;  representatives  of
employers, workers, SENAI, SENAC and    SENAR; and three recognized experts
in vocational training selected by the Minister of Labor.
1.8      However the Ministry  of  Labor  encountered  difficulties in the
management of employment and wage programs due to the lack of cohesion of
existing units within the new structure of the Ministry. These units were
restructured and organized within the Secretariat of Employment and Wages
which had been established in October 1974.



- 17 -
1.9      Plans for  the  establishment  of  an  employment  organization In
Brazil date back to 1953 when some activities were handled through the
Unemployment Assistance Fund. Later some of those activities were carried
out sporadically by the Regional Labor Offices in some states. In its 1975
reorganization, the   Ministry  of  Labor  set  up  the National Employment
System (SINE) under the Secretariat of Employment and WageR, with responsi-
bility for formulating general policy, providing technical guidance and
financial assistance to the system, developing ope.ating standards and
procedures, and  implementing  the  staff  training  program.    Each state
wishing to participate in SINE had to present a plan to the Secretariat of
Employment and Wages in accordance with the program guidelines, and sign
an agreement with the Ministry of Labor specifying the terms, conUtions
and financial assistance to  be  provided.    In  1976  there were  17 SINE
offices providing placement services in the states of Sao Paulo, Rio
Grande do Sul, Bahia, Santa Catarina and Piau, with a total of 656 techni-
cal and  administrative staff.   As  a complement to the government employ-
ment system, nearly 500 small private agencies are registered with the
Ministry of Labor.  In   1975,  the  National Council on Wage Policy (CNPS)
and the Council on Employment Policy (CNPE) were established to coordinate
the activities of the Ministry of Labor in the area of employment and
wages; comprising representatives of the ministries concerned, employees
and employers, and other institutious.
1.10     Problens  relating  to  the  occupational  safety  and  health  of
Brazilian workers were addressed by specialized units within the Ministry
of Labor,  through  appropriate  legislation and mechanisms for supervision
by the Regional  Labor  Offices.   In 1968 FUNDACENTRO (National Foundation
for Occupational Safety Hygiene and Medicine) was established in Sao Paulo
under the Ministry of   Labor.    Its  functions are to conduct studies and
related  research,  provide    specialized  services,  and  train  doctors,
engineers, supervisors, nurses,  and    other  specialists. The creation of
FUNDACENTRO was prompted mainly by the Government's aim of responding to
the increase in occupational accidents and work-related diseases in
Brazil, which at that time had rates far exceeding world averages, with
adverse effects on the labor force and the economy.
1.11    At the time project: preparation was initiated in 1976, conditions
in Brazil with respect to the various components to be covered by the proj-
ect objectives were as described in the following sections.
A. Vocational Training
1.12     Primary sector.   The  training  of  rural workers, virtually non-
existent in Brazil, was conducted through the rural extension system but
it was focused on technical assistance to farmers and small-scale producers
through EMBRAPA, the EMBRATER system and to a lesser extent INCRA. In 1976
PIPMO (Intensive Program for Manpower Training), associated with the
Ministry of Labor, carried out limited activities in rural vocational
training under agreements with rural extension services and other agencies
operating in the rural sector (agricultural cooperatives, rural labor
unions, religious bodies, etc.).    The Ministry  of Education and Culture



- 18 -
also undertook training of rural workers on a very small scale through its
network of Agricultural Technical Schools. To take care of the training of
rural workers the Brazilian Government established SENAR (National Service
for Rural Training) on March 31, 1976. When the studies for preparation of
the project commenced, SENAR organization and structure was emerging.
1.13     Secondary sector.   The  training  of  industrial workers has been
handled by SENAI  (National  Service  for  Industrial Apprenticeship) since
1942. SENAI is a semi-autonomoui agency under the responsibility of the
National Confederation of Industry.    With a highly decentralized adminis-
tration exercised by the National Directorate and within states by the
State Councils of the Confederation, SENAI has operated through its network
of 316 branches composed by technical schools, vocational training centers,
training centers and  training  agencies.    It  has  also been involved in
industrial firms, through special programs for young and adult training.
PIPMO also has been concerned with the training of industrial workers
through programs of occupational upgrading under agreements with SENAI,
industrial firms, trade unions, religious agencies and others, giving
priority to areas not served by the vocational training agencies. Some
industrial firms (327) -- especi&lly the large national and multinational
comp&nies -- have developed special vocational training programs under
exemption agreements with SENAI (32) or with their own resources. The
Ministry of Education and Culture, through its network of tecanical
schools, other state agencies and certain religious institutions, has also
carried out separate activities for the training %! industrial workers, In
training for administration and management, a reasonable number of private
firms and organizations had specific programs in 1976. But despite all the
activities of the different agencies providing vocational training for
industrid1 workers in Brazil, more was needed to meet the country's demand
for skilled workers. It was clear, moreover, that the contributions of the
firms -- and of the Government -- were insufficient to allow expansion of
the activities of SENAI and other institutions.
1.14     Tertiary sector.  The training  of workers for trade and services
has been provided mainly through SENAC (National Service for Commercial
Apprenticeship), a semi-autonomous agency established in 1946 and placed by
the Government under the   responsibility  of the National Confederation of
Commerce.  PIPMO  has  also  undertaken  manpower  training programs in the
areas of- commerce, general services, hotel and tourism services, and
health, in cooperation with  SENAC  and  other  agencies.   The Ministry of
Education and Culture, the state governments, and particularly the network
of private schools have afforded  opportunities  for training in the fields
of accounting, administration and  health.    It  should  be noted that the
tertiary sector already pointed to major changes in the country's labor
force, especially in the sectors of hotels and tourism, transportation,
communications, and -- at an early stage -- data processing.
B. Employment Services
1.15     Prior to  the  division  of  the  Ministry  of  Labor   and Social
Security and upon the establishment of the Ministry of Labor (1974),
employment issues in Brazil were handled by the Department of Labor



- 19 -
Relations, which operated through units within the Regional Labor Offices.
In 1974 the Secretariat of Employment and Wages was established, followed
by the  National Employment System (SINE).   By 1976 SINE had established a
limited network of employment agencies in some states, providing placement
services.
1.16     At the time of preparation of  the  project SINE was new and func-
tioning inefficiently due mainly to regional disparities in operational
standards and procedures. There was a serious shortage of specialists, a
lack of organizational structure in several states, as well as issues with
national office.
C. Occupational Safety and Medicine
1.17     In 1975 some 2 million workers  (about  15% of the insured indus-
trial labor force) were involved in  occupational   accidents.  In 1968 the
Government had set up the National Foundation for Occupational Safety,
Hygiene and Medicine (FUNDACENTRO), affiliated with the Ministry of Labor
and Social Security and located  in  Sao  Paulo.   Its function was to deal
with the issues related to the prevention of occupational accidents. In
1972, with the technical cooperation of FUNDACENTRO, the Government had
made it compulsory for firms with over 100 employees to establish special-
ized occupational safety, hygiene and health services. FUNDACENTRO would
be responsible for the postgraduate training of safety engineers, medical
officers and nurses. It was also to train safety supervisor and foremen;
conduct studies and research and provide technical as3sistance to enter-
prises in the fields of industrial hygiene and occupational safety. At the
time of preparation  of  the    project  FUNDACENTRO  did not have adequate
physical facilities; its technical  offices  and   some rudimentary labora-
tories were located in  different  places.    It  also  had  three regional
centers in Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia and Recife. Its technical-administra-
tive structure showed serious  deficiencies  attributable  to   the lack of
qualified personnel and of an administrative infrastructure compatible with
its objectives.
D. Secretariat of Mannower
1.18     The Secretariat of Manpower in  the Ministry  of Labor was estab-
lished in October 1974 following reorganization of the Ministry, after the
division of the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare. Since January 1975
the Secretariat of Manpower was made responsible for the administration of
PIPMO, transferred from the Ministry of Education and Culture. With the
promulgation of Law 6297 authorizing tax incentives for enterprises finan-
cing their own training activities, the establishment of the National
Vocational Training System and the Federal Council of Manpower (whose
ex officio chairman is the Secretary of Manpower), the Secretariat of
Manpower, which was in its early stages of implementation, encountered some
difficulties in meeting its  objectives.   The extent of its responsibili-
ties, coupled with the   impossibility  of  augmenting its staff because of
inadequate budgetary resources, and  issues in recruiting qualified techni-
cal personnel because of the   Government's wage policy, seriously hindered
the fulfillment of its tasks  and    objectives.   Furthermore, the lack of
research  and  studies  on  the    characteristics  and  cenditions  of the
Brazilian labor market -- except some    sectoral studies done by SENAI and
CNRH (National Human Resources Center), among   others -- made it difficult



- 20 -
to implement decisions concerning  identification  of   the country's voca-
tional training requirements. The well-known situation of the Ministry of
Labor in June 1976 was the. basis for the Minister of Labor, Arnaldo
Prieto's decision, to send a  request    to the Planning Secretariat of the
Office of the President of the Republic for analysis of a proposed loan
package to be presented to the Intern.4tional Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD), on arrival of a Bank mission expected to carry out the
initial analysis of the project.
1.19     The initial work of the mission together with specialists from the
Ministry of Labor, SENAI, SENAC, SENAR, FUNDACENTRO, Secretariat of
Employment and Wages and SINE established the broad guidelines for prepara-
tion. Project objectives, scope and content were defined with the assis-
tance of successive IBRD missions to Brazilian Government agencies, partic-
ularly the Ministry of    Labor,  the  process  begun  in June 1976 and was
completed with the appraisal in May 1977 (11 months).
1.20     The project was conceived as a means of strengthening the National
Vocational Training System and the National Employment System and improving
and expanding training programs for occupational safety, hygiene and
medicine. It was decided, as the strategy for achieving those goals, to
strengthen the infrastructure of the Ministry of Labor through specific
investments in agencies under its direct control and those affilia,:d with
it. The agencies participating in the project and directly administered by
the Ministry are: Secretariat of Manpower (SMO), Secretariat of Employment
and Wages (SES) and National Services for Rural Training (SENAR). The
affiliated agencies ares National Service for Industrial Apprenticeship
(SENAI), National Service for Commercial Apprenticeship (SENAC), and Jorge
Duprat Figuereido National Foundation for Occupational Safety Hygiene and
Medicine (FUNDACENTRO).
1.21     The project as formulated had the following objectives:
(a)  to expand opportunities  for  vocational  training  in the various
sectors of the economy;
(b)  to relieve the shortage of skilled workers;
(c) to upgrade the quality of instructors and technicians in the
agencies taking part in the Program through training and technical
assistance (fellowships for study abroad);
(d) to update an information base relating to the existing stock of
skilled manpower in the various sectors of the economy through
studies and research;
(e)  to  prepare  and   d-stribute   instructional  materials  for  the
hotel catering services and general administration areas.
1.22     The project as formulated had the following operational goalst
(a) establishment of vocational training centers in the secondary and
tertiary sectors of the economy, and of hotel training schools;
(b) introduction of mobile units for rural training;



- 21 -
(c) technical assintance and training for supervisors, administrators
and instructors of the agencies participating in the program;
(d) research and instructional and methodological resources to improve
vocational training coordination and planning at the national
level;
(e) establishment of a National Headquarters/Training Center and
regional centers to train specialists in occupational safety and
health training.
The formulation of the project, in consonance with the needs
existing at the time in the Ministry of Labor and in its affiliated
agencies, res-2onded to the objectives emerging from the reorganization and
changes that were then   affecting  the  various  units of the Ministry and
those agencies.
1.23     The proposed project would enhance  the capability of the Ministry
of Labor to perform its functions within the recently establishad National
Manpower Training System. Basically, those functions would be to coordi-
nate and rationalize the expansion of the country's puhlic and private
vocational   training  institutions  so  as  to  alleviate  the shortage of
skilled and semi-skilled workers in all sectors of the economy, in accor-
dance with established development priorities. Besides this institution
building effect, the  project would  provide for a substantial increase in
vocational training for selected subsectors and geographic areas, through
the physical facilities to be financed. Finally, the project would comple-
ment the aforementioned vocational training activities through the expan-
sion of nationwide employment information and placement system and an
occupational safety and health program.
II. IDENTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT. PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
A. General Obiectives
2.1      The project, as described in  the introduction to this report, was
designed to support the activities of the Ministry of Labor relating to the
various systems affiliated with it  and  under  its responsibility.  In its
first version, described in Notice G01380/76 of May 31, 1976, the Minister
of Labor proposed the following cmponents to the Chief Minister of the
Planning Secretariat of the Office of the President of the Republic:
(a)  construction and equipping oft
(i)    a national center for vocational training;
(ii)    15 industrial training centers of SENAI and groups of similar
firms;
(iii)    five SENAC hotel training schools;
(b)  equipping or re-equipping and furnishing of:



- 22 -
($l    SENAI industrial training centers;
(ii)    180 rural mobile training units for SENAR;
(iii)    lQcal offices of the National Employment System for placement
of trained workers; and
(iv)    nine  regional  occupational   safety   and  health  training
centers.
(c) technical assistance for set:ing up the Rational Manpower Training
System;
(d) research;
(e) project administration costs.
This project proposal was the subject of lengthy discussions among experts
from the World Bank, the Ministry of Labor, SENAI, SENAC, SINE, SMO and
FUNDACENTRO, with    the  direct  participation  of SUBIN  of the Planning
Secretariat of the Office of the President of the Republic. The following
changes were made  to  the  original    proposal  during  the final project
preparation.
B. Construction and Eauipment
2.2      The construction and equipping of the national center for training
of personnel involved in vocational training activities was eliminated,
inasmuch as the country already has an agency with similar objectives:
CENAFOR (National Center for Vocational Training) located in Sao Paulo and
affiliated with the Ministry of Education and Culture.
2.3      The  construction  and  equipping  of  SENAI  industrial training
centers was reduced to 12 units because of the lack of counterpart funds.
2.4      The number of  hotel  training  schools was  reduced to three and
three SENAC commercial training centers were added, also due to the
agency's financial problems.
C.  EaulD2ina or Reeouipvins and Purnishins
2.5      The number of SENALI vocational training centers was reduced to one
because of financial problems.
(a) the local offices of SINE were eliminated;
(b) technical assistance to advise in the organization of the National
Vocational  Training  System was   transferred  to  the  ILO-UNDP
project.
D. New Subproiects Included
2.6      The SENAI projects were expanded  to include subprojects for staff
training of instructors and an evaluation study to assess the results of
experimental individualized instruction techniques being utilized at DR-
SENAI-Rio de Janeiro;



- 23 -
2.7      The SENAC projects were expanded  to include subprojects for staff
training and preparation of instructional materilds for the areas of hotel
and tourism services;
2.8      The SINE project was substantially  modified.  Due to the agency's
short period of operation, the lack of adequate staffing and the inexperi-
ence and inefficiency of implementation of SINE prompted the inclusion of
subprojects focusing on staff improvement within SINE (international
seminar, external consulting services, fellowships for study in Brazil and
abroad, initial staff training and upgrading courses).
2.9      Initial discussions with  the  Brazilian  Government on a possible
third education project began in February 1976 during a World Bank mission.
It was decided that while further assistance to the formal educational
system was appropriate and would be supported in future IBRD projects, the
more immediate priority was to complement those efforts by assistance to
non-formal vocational training to meet the short and medium-term manpower
requirements of the economy, for which the Ministry of Labor is respon-
sible. In May 1976 a Bank identification mission reached a tentative
agreement with the Government on the possible content of the third project,
which was being prepared  locally.    In August 1976 another Bank mission,
assisted by ILO specialists in    the training of industrial workers. rural
training, hotel trainings, occupational safety and health training and
employment services, p:eappraised the project and provided technical assis-
tance to the Government in  completing  its preparation.  Bank appraisal of
the project took place in  November-December  1976  by an IBRD mission com-
posed   of  Mr. R. Hemingway    (education   specialist),   Mr. A. Tobelen
(economist),   Mr. J. Levine   (economist,   consultant),   Mr. Y. Tencalla
(agriculture specialist) and Mr. R. Corradine (architect).
2.10     After the modifications that were made during appraisal, the proj-
ect was set up to finance:
(a)  construction, furniture and equipment for:
- twelve industrial training centers;
- three hotel training schools;
- three commercial training centers;
- a national headquarters/training center for occupational safety
and health training;
(b) equipment for:
- one existing industrial training center;
- eight regional training centers in the areas of occupational
safety and health with the Government being responsible for
providing the buildings;
- 180 mobile units for rural training.



- 24 -
(c)  staff training fort
- 600 supervisors for the industrial, comercial and hotel
training schools;
- 2,525 administrative and technical personnel of the National
Employment System.
(d) the costs of:
- studies on the labor market and follow-up of former trainees;
-  preparation  of   instructional   materials   for  training  in
hotel and commercial services.
(e) technical assistance in the form of:
- 36-2/3 man/years of specialists' services;
- 27-1/4 manlyears of fellowships;
- a seminar on employment information and placement services.
(f) the costs of administering the project, including:
-  100l   of the salaries of the six specialists of the ptoject unit
during Implementation;
-  consulting services for the project unit.
2.11     The chaiges  made  in  the  project,  differing  from  the initial
proposal presented by the  Government, were  accepted by the participating
agencies on the basis of the projects they had prepared with the assistance
and supexvision  of Ministry  of Labor  specialists.    The participating
agencies prepared detailed  studies  of  each  subproject, with analyses of
sites, preliminary designs, equipment and furniture basic lists, local
manpower requirements, etc.
2.12     The differences between  the  original  Government  request to the
Bank and the  final project  proposal were  due  mainly to financial con-
straints in the case of SEN&I and SENAC, agencies which were to furnish
their own councerpart funds. At the time when the project was prepared the
Brazilian economy already was showing tangible signs of the economic and
financial recession that was intensified during the period of its execu-
tion.  The changes made  in  the  SINE  project were due to the structural
weaknesses of the agency, lack of manitgement capacity because of its
technical  level,  and   the   shortcomings   associated with  its  recent
establishment.
III. IMPLEMENTATION
3.1      Loan Agreement  14521BR,  signed  on  September  7,  1977  by the
Federative    Republic   of   Brazil   and   the    nternational  Bank  for
Reconstruction  and  Development  (IBRD),   had   the  general  purpose  of



- 25 -
supporting the Ministry of Labor in the expansion of the major vocational
training institutions, the National Employment System, and the upgrading of
operational projects ir. the areas of occupational safety, hygiene and
medicine. Project implementation commenced on February 16, 1978 with the
appointment by the Ministry of Labor of the members of the Executive
Directorate of the project, pursuant to Decree 80.930 of December 5, 1977
and Explanatory Statement 055 of October 25, 1977. The delay in initiating
the project was due to difficulties that arose at the time in allocating
budgetary resources for the operation of the Project Unit and the counter-
part funds required for the 1978 budget year, since the budget proposal had
already been approved by the National Congress. Although the Project Unit
had not been set up, in that same year of 1977 the CFP Varzea Grande (item
03) and the CFP Sao Jose dos Campos (item 10) projects were begun; the Bank
provided retroactive financing of the expenditures made during that period
by those projects.
3.2      The implementation schedule  (Annex  I)  shows  that project had a
duration of seven years and nine months from the date of signing of the
Loan Agreement, which means that the delay was two years and six monvhs
from the date originally indicated.   The delay can be explained and justi-
fied on the following grounds:
(a) the economic crisis that beset the country caused SENAC to cancel
the construction of the hotel training schools in 1981, 1982 and
1983. To replace the hotel training schools, given the need for
smaller appropriation of counterpart funds, in addition to the
three centers originally envisaged, 14 new cencers were built
and/or remodelad (construction, and equipment) and two additional
received equipment and furniture.   Due  to the replacement of the
hotel training schools, all projects for construction, equipment
and furniture were revised to  reflect the changes with additional
time required to prepare designs, draw up equipment and furniture
lists, prepare bidding documents, etc.
(b) The waiver of Import licenses by CACEX, and later by SEI, turned
out to be a lengthy and significantly delayed process.
(c) The delay in the waiver by the Planning Secretariat of the Office
of the President of the Republic in respect of the special sche-
dules for allowing recruitment of SENAR personnel held up the
start of that project by nearly three years.
(d)  Delays in starting several projects  were  due to the Bank's slow-
ness in approving the pertinent amendments t, Loan Agreement
14521BR, and were  also  largely  responsible  for  the failure to
implement the program within the periods envisaged.
(e) The execution of the SENAI projects within the planned periods, at
costs notably lower than those indicated in the appraisal (about
57% of the estimates), prompted the inclusion in the project of
additional school units (3 built and equipped, 3 equipped only);
102 fully equipped mobile units and 89 man/months of fellowships
for study abroad.  The  new  projects  approved by the Bank in the
amendment of January 21, 1981 justified the extension of the
implerAntation period of the project.



- 26 -
3.3      However, the delays in project  execution had the following posi-
tive featuress
(a)  SENAI had a 512 increase  in building areas; 702 increase in tise
number of training (including the mobile units)J inclusion of
fellowships for study abroad in the fields of new technologies,
educational guidance and new vocational training methods, seeking
the adjustment of technical personnel to the new requirements of
the Brazilian labor market;
(b) in SENAC, despite a 511 reduction in the total cost of the proje-
ct, the number of  training  places  was  increased by 472Z, with
priority given to the poorest areas (North and Northeast); intro-
duction of courses to train personnel ln data processing by
equipping with microcomputers a national canter and the regional
commercial training centers; establishment and installation of a
national center for the preparation of instructional materials
(video tapes, slides, etc.), with a 9661 increase in the number
of instructional unlts compared to the figure in the appraisal;
3431 increase in the number of fellowships abroad envisaged at
appraisal.;
(c) FUNDACENTROs       included   a   project   for   'Preparation  of
Instructional Materials for Agriculture"; and
3d) SECRETARIAT OF MANPOWER:  increased the number of research proj-
ects and studies on manpower  issues  from  1 to  11 projects, in areas of
high priority for the Ministry of Labor and the National Vocational
Training System (Annex III).

C. HiRhliahts of Project Executioai
3.11     The project was administered  by  the Manpower Development Support
Program (PRODEMO), a newly established unit affiliated with the General
Secretariat of the Ministry of Labor, with technical, administrative and
financial autonomy.   The  autonomy  of PRODEHO had important consequences
for the administration of the project:  it permitted the flexible and effi-
cient implementation of the various projects included under Loan Agreement
14521BR. It is worth noting, also, that PRODEMO was able to operate
effectively because of its  autonomy,  despite the legal And administrative
diversity of the participating agencies, two of which (SEMAI and SENAC) are
semi-autonomous agencies arM four (SENAR, SMO, SINE and FUNDACENTRO) are
government agencies.
3.12     As part of its activities,  PRODEMO  drew up normative and indica-
tive documents to guide the agencies in the preparation of specifications
and basic lists of furniture and equipment, including indication of the
estimated costs.
3.13     The architectural design specifications contained in the appraisal
were the reference point for the preparation of projects within the insti-
tutions themselves (SENAI and SENAC). FUNDACENTRO obtained assistance from
outside consultants and from PRODEMO engineers, which was fundamental for
maximizing the use and functional relevance of designed facilities, partic-
ularly the specialized laboratories.    PRODEMO  drew up uniform guidelines
and instructions for bidding procedures on civil works, equipment and
furniture. The standards established, pursuant to Brazilian legislation
and IBRD guidelines, were defined specifically for international competi-
tive bidding (civil works and equipment) competitive bidding advertised
locally and regular Government procurement procedures (local shopping),
having been submitted for prior approval by the Bank, and were utilized by



- 30 -
all participating agencies during the execution of the project. Competi-
tive bidding results, in accordance with their maximum amounts, were in all
cases submitted to the Bank for review, following specific models. Except
for construction of the Vila Leopoldina Vocational Training Center of SENAI
and the CTN of FUNDACENTRO, for which international competitive bidding
procedures were held, all works were awarded through competitive bidding
advertised locally. Four local competitive bidding for construction (two
for SENAI, one for SENAC and one for FUNDACENTRO) had contract prices above
the limits stipulated in the invitations to tender and were canceled. New
local competitive biddings were opened and the prices offered were within
the stipulated limits.
3.14     The general bidding criteria for civil works, equipment and furni-
ture provided for a  prequalification  phase  prior  to the presentation of
bids, in accordance with Brazilian legislation. In the case of civil works
the procedures were established for a system of point scoring for the pre-
qualification of bidders.    Bids  were  evaluated  with  reference to base
prices previously established and submitted to the Bank for review, for
firms whose bids fell within the range of 10% above and 202 below the base
prices. The criteria for basic qualification in the case of equipment and
furniture were fulfilled applied by verification of the technical and
financial capacity of the different    bidders in accordance with Brazilian
legislation. In their evaluation, PRODEMO drew up individual comparative
tables of execution, to permit an adequate comparison between the technic-
al specifications in the invitations to tender and the bids presented,
item by item. In the majority of cases the lowest purchase price pre-
vailed, technical conditions being equal. As for the procurement of equip-
ment and furniture, in a total of 14 public international competitive bids,
38 local competitive bids and 316 local shopping bids, there was only one
problem, concerning interuational competitive    bidding DN-02181, in which
Recrusul S.A. sought an  injunction  from    the federal courts against the
decision of the SENAI bidding  commission.    The   final decision was com-
pletely favorable to the position of SENAI.
3.15     The subprojects added as a  consequence  of the amendments to Loan
Agreement 1452/BR were appraised by PRODEMO following a methodology
approved by the Bank. Supervision of the works was the responsibility of
the agencies themselves in the case of SENAI and SENAC, with monitoring by
PRODEMO. In the case of FUNDACENTROt PRODEMO was involved in the supervi-
sion and direct monitoring of implementation.
3.16     The research done by the  Secretariat  of Manpower, with its scope
significantly enlarged, was intended to identify the requirements and
characteristics of the Brazilian labor market, the implications of techno-
logical changes due to    automation  and computerization, the systematical
automation of documentation and communications systems, among other aspects
(Annex III).
3.17     One of the most important facets  of the project is the subproject
for  SENAI mobile units.    It was  an innovative move, broadly and firmly
backed by the Ministry of Labor-PRODEMO, to see the mobile units as a
plausible response to the challenge of expanding and diversifying ways of
meeting industry's vocational training needs, despite the financial con-
straints that the continuous loss of purchasing power of tax revenue was
already =mposing on SENAI. The conjunction of SENAI-Ministry of Labor-IBRD



- 31 -
efforts permitted a concurrent and significant physical expansion of the
system as well as the enhancement of its capability to capture, evaluate
and adapt international educational technology to the specific features of
the system's clientele, the scope of its objectives, and the characteris-
tics of the environment in which it must operate. In this case, thanks to
the good sense and competence  that  prevailed   in the negotiation of loan
amendments on the part of the Ministry of Labor-PRODEMO and IBRD, SENAI
was able to design, test and develop its prototype mobile units with a high
percentage of local content, in the units themselvAs as well as in the
equipment, implements and tools that they require. SEAAI now has 102 addi-
tional mobile units, covering different trades and enabling it to respond
more effectively to the growing need for improved training of industrial
workers. During 1981/82, 102 mobile units were built for various occupa-
tions, to meet the demand identified, namely:
-   14 refrigeration
-   12 hydraulic controls
-   21 electrical controls
-   12 pneumatic controls
-   18 diesel machinery
-   8 industrial sewing
-   11 breadmaking
-   6 sanitation
The start-up operation of these units was a real step forward in the
activities of SENAI. The impact on industry was felt later, as training
services were provided to firms more expeditiously and rapidl; because of
the flexibility that this mode of operation offers. Considering that each
unit can accommodate 12 persons, the 102 units represented 1,224 new places
for training of the firms' workers. If, at a minimum, these trainee places
were used in three shifts, it means  3,060  new opportunities.  We may add
that in general the  courses  are  of  short  duration,   which makes firms
consider even further their vast potential use. The design of the units was
studied carefully in order to reflect  the true circumstances of the firms.
Fully equipped for that purpose, they are mobile mini-firms.
3.18     Maintenance of  the mobile  units  is  performed  by the agencies
themselves, with resources earmarked  for  that  purpose.   Outlays for the
repair of equipment and furnishings are all but negligible, since any
issues are corrected by the instructors, trainees, and sometimes the firms
that receive the  units.   In  some cases (Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Alagoas
and Sergipe, among others) operational support centers have been set up,
to handle the  programming,    maintenance  and  operational  supply of the
units. The mobile units built under the IBRD project are currently dis-
tributed among the regional departments (states) as follows:

3.19     With regard to the  'progress  reports,'  it should be pointed out
that   PRODEMO,  following  IBRD  instructions,  prepared  special forms to
facilitate monitoring of the various projects, despite their complexity
and diversity as  already  noted.    The  periodicity  of  reporting to the
Education Division, which was originally on a quarterly basis was changed
to semi-annually, based on the quality, accuracy and reliability shown by
PRODEMO. In addition to the 'progress reports' just mentioned, a number of
documents 'rere prepared by PRODEMO and the participating agencies with
respect to terms of reference, methodology, regulations and guidelines,
specific projects, and appraisal reports.    All of these were submitted to
the World Bank for review.
D. Educational and Physical Aspects
3.20     We can  assert  that  the  results  obtained  by the participating
agencies have been excellent at all centers that were built and equipped,
mobile units, and mobile actions already under way. Some recently com-
pleted units are operating with only two shifts, the night shift having
been suspended temporarily because of the economic crisis; nevertheless,
annual enrollment stands at approximately 10OZ of the projected figure.
Once the  country's    economic  difficulties  have  been  overcome,  it is
expected that within on. year annual enrollment will substantially exceed
the number estimated in the appraisal.
3.21     The  following  contributions  of   the   SENAI project  to  that
institution are worthy of note:
(a)  its physical  netwcrk  acquired  a  new  dimension  because of the
centers built or expanded;
(b) new possibilities were opened for better service to firms.
Already in 1984, despite the financial constraints of several
regional departments which could operate with only two shifts,
SENAI handled 25,461 new enrollments with these new centers;
(c) centers were established in regions where demand for vocational
training had been needed the most;
(d) equipment was allocated to centers with more pressing needs;
(e) the acquisition of modern equipment allowed the introduction of
new technologies in its  training  courses.   This factor, coupled
with the suitable preparation of instructors, prompted a substan-
tial improvement in the productivity of the firms that were served
by SEMAI;
(f) according to information gathered in the regional units which
regularly monitor their trainees, nearly all were placed in the
labor market after completing their training programs; and
(g) the noteworthy improvements in the equipment furnished to the
centers have permitted the transfer of technology to firms. This
has been happening in Goias, Rio Grande do Sul, Mato Grosso, Mato
Grosso do Sul and other states with great success.



- 34 -
3.22     The SENAC project  has  produced  the  following benefits for that
agoncy?
(a) construction of multipurpose coumercial training centers located
in strategically defined cities based on labor market needs;
(b) better utilization of resources through the expansion of other
vocational training units located in the country's North and
Northeast regions.
(c) Equipment and furniture for the vocational training centers built,
and establishment in all DRS and DES of training centers for the
area of data processing, as well as installation of a video
cassette production unit;
(d) the positive impact of the changes in the project can be seen in
the increase in annual enrollment, projected at 14,500 trainees
but actually reaching 66,084, i.e. 4552 greater (1984).
(e) as to the benefits obtained by the agency through the development
of manpower resources in the form of training and technical assis-
tance, the following are worthy of note:
-    implementation  of  an  appropriate  methodology  for serving
needy populations;
-    establishment  in  DRS  and   DES  of  occupational  guidance
centers;
-    preparation of the 'curriculum  planning guide' for the areas
of hotel services, health, office work and tourism;.
-    preparation of the hotel and tourism master plant
-    revision of manuals, forms and administrative procedures;
-    adjustment of the program-budget  to  the situation of SENAC;
and
(f) with regard to the experience of study tours abroad, the fellows
not only established contacts in regard to future technical co-
operation agreements, but also learned about trends and prospects
in the development of vocational training techniques and methods
that enhance the value of our programs, with a direct impact ons
-    redefinition of the areas of activity of the institution;
-    introduction of curriculum modules;
-    Introduction of individualized instruction;
-    preparation of  Instructional materials  following the "CBC"
and 'instructional module" methods;
-    planning of 'audiovisual resource' units (Laval Laboratory).



- 35 -
3.23     Both SENAI and SENAC entered a  new field with the inauguration of
data processing courses.    SENAI is  engaged  chiefly in equipment repair
(hardware) while SENAC is concerned with the use of equipment and program-
ming (software). The labor market for these occupations at the present
time is promising, with Brazilian firms expanding rapidly and generating
many direct and indirect jobs.
3.24     FUNDACENTRO,  lacking   previous   experience   in   many  of  its
specialized laboratories, made a great effort to fulfill the original
objectives of its varied and sophisticated courses. As the equipment --
all of it imported --   arrived  at  the  centers, it was installed and the
courses were begunl the laboratories were not completely installed until
the end of the project, due to the imporc issues already mentioned. Annual
enrollment reached 30S of the projected number in 1984. It is expected
that within not more than one year the National Headquarters/Training
Center and the regional centers will  be  able to meet the country's needs,
serving the enrollment envisaged  in  the  project.   FUNDACENTRO  plans to
enter into agreements with South American countries to upgrade its staff in
occupational safety and medicine through seminars, internships, courses,
etc., using the facilities of the National Technical Center in Sao Paulo.
A Technical Cooperation Agreement was signed with ILO for this purpose.
3.25     At the initiation of the project  SENAR had problems in setting up
its mobile units because of administrative red tape in the approval of
schedules for hiring technical and administrative staff. The issues were
overcome and studies were implemented with the direct participation of the
Bank; the mobile units became mobile operations with a nearly 152 increase
in the number of places  to    be  filled.    The  third stage of the SENAR
project was implemented toward the end  of 1984. Present enrollment is 74X
of the original projection, with satisfactory  results.  This permits us to
conclude that the improved training of rural workers is beginning to be
reflected in the increased production and greater productivity of Brazilian
agriculture. Full operation of the mobile actions is expected in one year,
reaching the annual enrollment of  about  500,000 trainees indicated in the
revised plan.
E. Trainina of Instructors. Specialists, and Administrative Staff
3.26     SENAI and SENAC together trained  1,964 instructors -- three times
the number projected -- in courses averaging three months, either at the
agencies themselves or under agreements with training institutions. The
training programs, with the prerequisite of at least the equivalent of a
secondary education, have as course content pedagogical aspects and
technical upgrading or adaptation, depending on the type of activity and
the area of study. The results of this training were so significant that
SENAT and SENAC have been setting up medium-term programs to recycle its
staff instruc:ors.  In the  specific  case  of SENAI, a special methodology
was developec by the agency with the advisory support of PRODEMO, to train
instructors in r4urses at training centers.  They consisted of 240 hours in
the first phase on methodological aspects, and 870 hours of off-site
courses in the areas of technological content, technical design and mathe-
matics with monitoring and supervision by specialist staff.



- 36 -
3.27     SENAR trained  2,931  instructors  in manpower training programs,
this project was included in the amendment of January 21, 1981. The
quality of the instruction provided by the agencies participating in the
program has been very good because of the excellence of the physical faci-
lities, equipment, and level of their instructors. SINE trained 2,525
professional staff, the number determined in accordance with its present
needs. Agreements were made witni specialized institutions to provide the
initial training necessary and sufficient to carry on its activities. The
number trained was 100% of the number planned, meeting all of the agency's
training requirements for its technical and administrative structure.
F. Research and Studies on NanMower Issues and Methodology
3.28     This subproject, partially financed  under the loan agreement, was
implemented through various agencies whereby they signed agreements to
conduct a variety of research to identify problems in meeting the objec-
tives of the Secretariat and the National Vocational Training System.
The appraisal originally called for research responding to the needs and
characteristics of the Brazilian labor market in the three main economic
sectors.    Besides  the  studies  originally  contemplated,  another seven
research projects were done on such aspects ass social impact of techno-
logy; information system on the outputs of the National Vocational Training
System; statistical data for the Vocational Training System; documentation
lnd communication subsystems; employment, unemployment and vocational
training; fiscal incentives for vocational training; and labor market and
vocational training.
3.29     Based on the ongoing interest  of the agency in conducting studies
and research in the technical and administrative areas relevant to its
needs, the SENAI/IBRD/Ministry of Labor agreement included the project for
"Evaluation of Tndividualized Instructional Methodology' adopted by the
Regional Department of Rio de Janeiro.    The study was undertaken by SENAI
technical staff with the assistance of Brazilian consultants (48 manl
months). The main objectives achieved through the new strategy may be
sammrized as follows:
- Consideration of the individual characteristics of trainees;
- Disassociation of the individual's rate of learning from the
group's rate;
- Acceleration of training as each trainee develops his own rate
of learning;
-  Improvement of training,  chiefly  through effective indivi'ual
evaluation in the teaching-learning process;
- Better use of time and space allocated for training;
- Increase in the number of enrollments and completions, in part
through a reduction in drop-outs;
- A continuous flow of trained individuals to the labor market;
- Reduction of training costs (Annex III).

G. Technical Assistance
3.30     The  technical  assistance   program   included  the  services  of
Brazilian and foreign consultants specialists, fellowships for study
abroad, an international seminar on employment, and an assessment of the
individualized instructional methodology. The technical assistance program
was funded in part by UNDP/ILO for a total of US$1,500,000, paying the cost
of consultants for  the  Secretariat  of  Manpower,  SENAR, FUNDACENTRO and
SENAI.   The  technical  assistance  project  carried  out  by the agencies
participating  in  PRODEMO  exceeded   the   appraisal  estitmates  by  21S.
The agencies achieved the following results:
SENAI
3.31     The SENAI  project  for  fellowships  abroad  was  included in the
program by the amendment of October 4, 1983, with a total of 89 manimonths.
The objectives of these fellowships were:
(a) upgrading of educational guidance personnel;
(b) program for t.aining of specialists in the food processing sector
for production of canned foods and quality control;
(c) advanced training of specialists in educational technology and
data processing;
(d) advanced training of specialists in industrial instrumentation.
The fellowships for objectives (a) and (c) were carried out at the San
Diego University Foundation (USA) and those for objectives (b) and (d) at
the Association Francaise uour le Develogpment International des Formations
TechnoloRigues  (IUT) (France).    Besides the fellowships, SENAI performed
the research nentioned in paragraph 3.29 and Annex III.
SENAC
3.32     The SENAC project for fellowships abroad was expanded significant-
ly (3432) in response to the  need  for training of high-level staff with a
vie6 to the adaptation of SENAC to new technologies and methodology. The
SENAC international fellowships were conducted in nine countries (United
States, Europe and Latin America) in the following areas:
- Vocational training and employment policies
-  Planning of vocational training
- Methodology of vocational training
-  Occupational placement
- Training of trainers.

SENAR
3.33     Originally set at 95  man/months,  the scope of fellowships abroad
was reduced to 30 man/months  by  the  amendment  of October 1983; 49 manl
months were carried out.  Tne  types of fellowships originally envisaged in
the project were  study  tours  and  intensive  courses.    On the basis of
information obtained from the study tours undertaken during 1980  and 1981,
SENAR decided for the second stage of project execution to provide for
internships that would permit the observation of concrete situations,
discussion of them, and controlled applications with a view to the deve-
lopment of ideas and general principles concerning what had been observed.
The fellowships were carried out in 13 countriess Costa Rica, Honduras,
Guatemala, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Italy,
Switzerland, Israel and Ivory Coast.
SINE
3.34     The original goal of 82  man/months was decreased to 56 man/months
in October 1983, and the amended objective was exceeded. Implementation,
which began on a small scale in 1980, was stopped up in 1983 and completed
in 1985, thanks to the October 1982 contract for technical assistance
between SES/Ministry of Labor ane the Industrial Relations Research
Institute of the University of Wisconsin (USA). This contract covered
fellowships for study a6road as well as carrying out courses and seminars
with foreign specialists.    The  implementation  of  this last sub-project
reached its greatest intensity   in  1983.    The  original goal of 48 manl
months was changed to 25 man/months in October 1983 and was met in full.
FUNDACENTRO
3.35     FUNDACENTRO's program for fellowships  abroad was one of the most
important accomplishments of the project, enabling staff to receive
advanced training in the critical areas of occupational e&fety and
medicine.21 All of the fellowships were directly related to the work of
the fellows in FUNDACENTRO and were carried out at institutions in various
countries  and  at  the       plants   of  the  manufacturers  who  equipped
FUNDACENTRO's laboratories.   The  overall  results  for  the agency can be
suarized as follows:
-    Exchange of  experience  with  other  agencies facing similar
issues in the development of their activities.
-    Study of similar legislation to  identify aspects that can be
applied in Brazil.
2/ The Borrower notes that the training of of FUNDACENTRO's professional
staff and the equipping of their facilities enabled them to conduct
1,700 courses and reach 34,000 workers directly between 1980 and 1985.

3.36     The original goal was  30 manimonths,  but was increased by the
*fi        amendment of Octobor 1983 to  34 manlmonths.  Implementation was very slow
in the beginning, the program was  carried out almost entirely in the years
through 1985. The fellowships were Implemented in seven countries (Italy,
Switzerland, France, Spain, England, Germany and the United States) and
concerned the following areas of studys
-    Research and planning of vocational training
-    Organization and performance of vocational training systems.

IV. COSTS
4.1      In order to supervise  and monitor  project costs, PRODEMO estab-
lished Its own prograsmmed control system, using its own equipment and data
cards. The process proved efficient, so that PRODEMO was able to exercise
strict and accurate control over subproject costs, both in cruzeiros and US
dollars, in each of the participating agencies. Table 4 compares actual
costs of the various components (projected up to December 31, 1985) with
the appraisal estimates.
4.2      Table 4 also shows that the  total  project cost was 17X less than
the original estimate. In fact, most physical objectives were attained at
lower than expected cost.    The  components  with negative balances can be
explained on the basis of reimbursement procedures (which at the beginning
of implementation, used a repayment rate based on the exchange rate current
at the time of repayment instead of the exchange rate current on the day
expenses were made); and  exchange  rate  fluctuations.   Expenditures for
teaching materials, research and technical assistance increased as a result
of analyses of new programs undertaken jointly with World Bank missions for
adding further studies on employment and vocational training and expanding
the program of external fellowships.   Technical assistance costs also rose
as a result of increases in international travel expenses and allowances.
Two non-reimbursable categories (Professional Services and Administration)
were considerably higher because of SENAR's inclusion in these components,
not anticipated in the original project; and also due to proportionally
higher expenditures of SENAI, SENAC and FUNDACENTRO.

- 41 -
4.3      Contingencies were calculated  to  be  LS$26.1 M at appraisal, and
are included in Table 4.    The  table  shows the difference between actual
costs (projected up to December 31, 1985) and estimated costs to be
US$16.1 M, therefore only 622 of contingencies were sufficient to complete
the project, in spite of the significant increase in physical ob4ectives.
Counterpart Funds and World Bank Financinz
4.4      Pt appraisal, the US$32 M loan was  intended to .inance 352 of the
total project cost (US$92.5 4).   The amendment approved on October 4, 1983
lowered the total project cost to US$76.4 M, so that Bank financing
increased to 422 (see Table 5).

4.5      With  the  October 4, 1983  amendment,  World  Bank  financing for
Category 1 (civil works, furniture, staff training, research, teachingx
materials and professional services) rose from 352 to 57X. For Category 2
(equipment), it rose from 262 to 732 for domestically manufactured goods,
remaining  unchanged  for  imported  goods  (1001).    The  percentage  for
Category 3 (Project Unit salaries and technical assistance) also remained
unchanged. The changes in the levels of World Bank financing were a deci-
sive factor in the achievement of project objectives during the time
remaining for its execution (from October 4, 1983 to June 30, 1985). In
particular, it should be noted that in practically six years (from April 5,
1978 to December 31, 1983) 502 of the loan was disbursed. In the remaining
two years, 482  of  the  loan  was  disbursed.    The measure enabled total
counterpart funds to be reduced and adjusted to match the fall in the value
of the cruseiro.
4.6      In addition, the  opening  of  the  Special  Account (amendment of
December 14, 1982) expedited reimbursements, improving dash flows in SENAI
and SENAC and budget execution in organizations directly administered by
the Government. Repayments also became more regular because the exchange
rate applied was that current on the day bills were paid, whereas the
previous system used the exchange rate of the day funds were transferred by
the World Bank.



- 42 -
A. Unit Area and Cost
4.7      Table 6  shows  that unit  area  for  SENAI remained practically
unchanged from that planned (+111).   For SENAC it differed by -251 because
of the features of the new CFPs (Commercial Training Centers) with other
types of vocational training courses requiring less area per student.
The area of the FUNDACENTRO project was increased in its final version
because of  the  construction  of  garages  (in  compliance  with municipal
regulations) and an increase in administrative facilities (+77S), the
latter being financed entirely by the organization itself.
4.8      Actual unit costs were all  lower,  for the reasons already given;
i.e. the progressive devaluation of the currency, and the initial system of
reimbursement, which used conversion rates much higher than those applic-
able on the days that payments were made.   It should be po:5nted out that
unit costs in the column  headed    'Appraisal' in Table 6 include physical
and price contingencies, and that  these were overestimated, especially for
SirHAR, where the cost of equipment per student was also overestimated. As
regards SENAC, the costs of civil works, furniture and equipment were over-
estimated. On average, unit costs are about 37X lower than at appraisal.

B. Overating Costs
4.9      Operating expenditures differed  from  one participating agency to
another:
4.10     SENAI:  This is  a  semi-autonomous  entity with a separate budget
for each regional  department.    It  faced  special  problems because some
Regional Departmenats -- as a result  of  the economic crisis -- were forced
to reduce the number  of  evening  courses  offered.   This affected actual
enrollment levels compared with the appraisal estimates for each project.
However, the increases resulting from amendments to the project (affecting
mobile units and CFPs constructed and equipped, or oniy equipped) caused an
adjustment of the appraisal objectives, with actual performance 33Z higher
than projected.
4.11     SENAC:  This is  a  semi-autonomous entity with a separate budget
for each regional department.   Its  position was quite different from that
of SENAI. The replacement of the very high-cost hotel training schools,
with their low enrollments, by low-cost and high-enrollment CRPs meant that
in spite of the economic crisis, appraisal objectives were exceeded by
4552.
4.12     SENARt  This agency  is  administered  directly by the Government,
and affiliated with the Ministry of Labor, from which it receives Its
budgetary allocations. The funds provided over the period were reasonably
sufficient to cover operating costs.   The reduction in enrollments (74Z of
the estimate) was mainly due to the Government's restrictions on hiring
(which applied throughout the civil service) and the delay in preparing the
mobile units and making them operational.
4.13     FUNDACENTROt    This  is  a  legally  constituted  semi-autonomous
foundation, with a budget funded from industrial accident Insurance
premiums and contributions from the Ministry of Social Security and other
sources.   Enrollments were much  lower  than  forecast  (301 because the
national financial crisis reduced the agency's revenue. Over the period
resources were adequate to cover personnel costs and overheads, but its
operations had to be reduced.
V. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
5.1      The performance of the  participating agencies varied according to
their different operational and structural characteristicst
A. SENAI
5.2      Management of this  organization  is completely decentralized, and
the results achieved in its subprojects were exceptional, as follows:
(a) planning of the various units with respect to architecture,
engineering, equipment specifications and furniture was imple-
mented according to the revised schedule;



- 45 -
(b)  instructor training programs  employed  the  agency's own methodo-
logy, which is up to par with international standards acceptable
for vocational training;
(c) criteria governing competitive bidding procedures for civil works,
equipment and furniture were sound and precise;
(d) the Director General and Regional Directors were cooperative and
readily complied with PRODEMO guidelines and regulations; and
(e) there were delays in the submission to PRODEMO of documentation
relating to expenditures incurred  (i.e., for equipment, furniture
and civil works), necessary to process reimbursement requests.
B. SENAC
5.3      This is an administratively centralized organization.  Its perfor-
mance in implementing the various subprojects was average.
(a) difficulties and delays affected planning of its units with regard
to architectural and engineering designs, equipment specifications
and furniture;
(b) projects for instructor and technician training were implemented
adequately although execution schedules suffered substantial over-
runs;
(c)  although  appropriate  bidding  criteria were  applied  for civil
works, equipment and furniture procurement, the lack of experience
on the part of administrative staff caused extraordinary delays in
the dispatch of documentation to PRODEMO, in most cases; and,
(d)  submission to  PRODEMO  of  documentation  on  payments (for civil
works, furniture and equipment) necessary to process reimbursement
requests, was excessively delayed, except in the final months.
C. SENAR
5.4      SENAR is an agency administered directly by the Government through
the Ministry of Labor. The following serious problems affected implementa-
tion of the subprojects:
(a) delays in appointirZ technical and teaching staff caused a three-
year overrun in project execution;
(b) changes of Director General (six different appointees during
project implementation) produced delays and a lack of administra-
tive continuity;
(c) because of these delays, budgetary allocation for FY78179, FY80181
and FY82 were not utilized;
(d)  administrative,  bureaucratic   problems   typical  of  government
agencies, aggravated by partisan political considerations, delayed
identification of site location for  the centers and agencies, and
their installation;



- 46 -
(e) excessively cent-alized decision-making processes hampered project
Implementation;
(f) the lack of adequately trained technical staff (particularly as it
affected the instructional resources subproject) led to delays and
unsatisfactory execution;
(g) although appropriate criteria were applied to bidding procedures
for equipment and service, the lack of experience of technical and
administrative staff in procurement matters caused delays in the
forwarding of documentation to PRODEKO in most cases;
(h) the lack of experience of the staff of the centers and agencies
caused problems in the receipt and utilization of equipment; and
(i) instructor and technician training projects were implem-.ted
according to the revised schedule.
D. FUNDACENTRO
5.5      FUNDACENTRO is a  semi-autonomous  foundation whose performance in
project implementation was average because:
(a)  the  planning   of   the   National  Headquarters/Training  Center
encountered difficulties and substantial delays due to the lack of
experience and uncertainties faced by the staff, particularly with
reference to the preparation of equipment lists;
(b) in spite of the technical and administrative staff's lack of
experience, appropriate criteria were followed in the bidding
processes for civil works, equipment and furniture;
(c) the level of accounting staff was low, causing problems in reim-
bursements procedures;
(d) PRODEKO's regulation and guidelines were not observed adequately
with exceptions and most difficulties were due to the lack of
experience of the staff;
(f) three different Superintendents were appointed during project
execution, and these changes caused implementation problems;
(g) there were delays in requests for reimbursements (especially for
imported equipment) because of the staff's technical and adminis-
trative inadequacies, and this adversely affected the success ox
the subprojects.
(h) the fellowships subproject vas exceptionally well executed, having
been perfectly tailored to the agency's technical needs. The
technical problems were solved and the technical standards of the
specialist staff were appreciably improved.

E. Secretariat of Manpower
5.6      The Secretariat of Manpower is  a government agency, linked to the
Ministry  of  Labor  which   achieved   above-average  results  in  project
implementationt
(a)  the subprojects were implemented  on  time, and terms of reference
and research methodology were well prepared;
(b) the subproject relating to fellowships abroad was efficiently
implemented, and in accordance with the appraisal estimate;
(c) the Secretary and Undersecretary showed themselves most willing to
comply with PRODEHO guidelines and regulations; and
(d) reimbursement procedures followed Bank guidelines and regulations.
F. SINE (National Employment System)
5.7      SINE is linked to the  Secretariat  of Employment and Wages of the
Ministry of Labor.   Implementation was  affected because of the following
problems:
(a)  due to the low level of  technical and administrative staff in the
first phase, the project had to be administratively and technical-
ly reformulated during subsequent administrations;
(b) certain subprojects were unsatisfactorily executed, and their
financial performance was  below  standard.    As a result, unused
resources were transferred to other projects in the Ministry of
Labor;
(c)  the  lack  of   sufficient   tachnical  and  administrative  staff
prevented carrying out certain subprojects, particularly with
regards  to  staff  training.    Although  physical  execution was
complete, the scope for a better result was prevented; and
(d)  compliance   with   PRODEMO   guidelines   and   regulations   wa
-satisfactory.
VI.  CONCLUSIONS A-D RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Conclusions
Gen ral Conclusions
6.1      The annual  enrollment  objectives  established  at appraisal were
fully met (see Table 2).   However, during project implementation there has
been a 31Z increase in the number of student places built. They will be
fully utilized in the short term, which means a total increase in enroll-
ments of 1271.
6.2      The Covenants established in the  Loan Agreement 1452-BR were ful-
filled, except as regards the follow-up of students.



- 48 -
6.3      Physical facilities (i.e., buildings,  mobile units, equipment and
furniture) are entirely satisfactory for the units' needs, both in economic
terms and appropriateness for the utilization envisaged.
6.4      The five amendments  to  the  Loan Agreement considerably improved
the project by expanding and modifying some of its components (SENAI mobile
units, SENAR projects, increases in research and fellowships, etc.).
6.5      The project had a significant  impact on the implementation of new
administrative and operational polhcies affecting both establishment of the
National Vocational Training System and also the participating agencies.
6.6      The  project  enabled   the  participating  agencies's  vocational
training activities to be expanded, especially in the poorer regions
(North, Northeast, and Center/West), and particularly in the cases of SENAC
and SENAR.
6.7      The project contributed  significantly  toward improved vocational
training standards by introducing new teaching methodologies, providing
more technologically up-to-date equipment, improved technical qualifica-
tions of instructors and experts through specialized training and fellow-
ships for study abroad.
6.8      The physical and prices  contingencies  estimated at appraisal for
certain categories of expenditure were overstated (by 39.22, but this
surplus enabled project objectives to be achieved and expanded.
6.9      Because of constant devaluation  of the cruzeiro, serious problems
arose with the administration of the annual budget allocations, which are
set eight months  in  advance  and  calculated  in  US dollars converted to
cruzeiros at a single  average  rate  (the  'fiscal'  dollar).  The average
reimbursements rate was at all  times  higher than forecast in the budgets,
producing lower expenditures in term  of US dollars.
6.10     The Special Account held by the Central Bank enabled reimbursement
for expenditures up to the US$1 M limit to be more flexible and expedi-
tious. When disbursement requests speeded up and their volume increased at
the end of 1984 and beginning of 1985, there were substantial processing
delays because the amounts requested often exceeded the balances in the
account.
Specific Conclusions
6.11     The following conclusions can be drawn from the performance of the
participating agencies in executing their projects:
SENAI
(a) the secondary-level vocational training system was expanded by
65,183 m2 of new construction, representing the 15 new centers
built, covering 11 states.   This  represents an increase of 8,100
student places, including the mobile units;



-49-
(b)  services were  improved  in  those  regions  lacking  CFTs  by the
deployment of 102 mobile units consisting of appropriate vehicles
carrying  up-to-date  equipment,   furnishings  and  instructional
materials;
(c) at the secondary level, there was an expansion in certain types of
vocational training already being provided by the agency and
improvement of other types of instruction as a result of the
introduction of new and modern  equipment.   Examples of these are
instrumentation, breadmaking, basic sanitation, computers (both
hardware and software), and others;
(d)  instructors were properly trained not only in te_;ching methods but
also in technological aspects of their work;
(e)  the new mobile  units  extended  the  range  of available forms of
vocational training;
(f) properly trained instructors substantially raised the standards
among trainees completing the courses;
(g) subsidies in the form of international fellowships obtained by the
agency's staff enabled  them  to  develop  new t$chnologies in the
fields of nutrition, information systems, educational guidance and
instrumentation; and
(h)  the know-how acquired while constructing mobile units of the most
up-to-date kind has provided  an  opportunity  for the transfer of
this technology to other organizations in Brazil and abroad.
SENAC
(a) the vocational training system serving the tertiary sector was
expanded by 28,098 m2 with the construction of nine new CFPs and
alterations and extensions to eight existing CFPs, thus creating
6,092 new student places;
(b)  human  resources  training   centers,   providing  instruction  in
information systems, were established in all Regional Departments.
The teaching and learning process was improved thanks to the
installation of a videocassette production unit attached to the
National Department;
(c) the implementation of subprojects for training technicians and
instructors and those providing international fellowships produced
the following results:
-    the agency's area of activity was redefined
-    a modular form of curriculum was introduced
-    individualized instruction was introduced
-    teaching  materials  were  prepared  following  the  CBC  and
"instructional module" methods
-    audiovisual   resource   units    were   established   (Laval
Laboratory)



- 50 -
an appropriate methodology was introduced to attend the needs
of marginal and poor communities
employment  guidance  centers  were  established  in regional
departments and districts (delegacias)
the Curriculum  Planning  Guide  was  prepared  for hotel and
catering, health, office services and tourism trades
the master plan for the hotel and catering trades and tourism
was prepared
manuals, forms and administrative procedures were revised
the program-budget was adjusted  in line with SENAC's present
situation
the  replacement  of  the   hotel  training  schools  by  the
construction of new centers ard the alterationlextension of
existing centers (14), together with the introduction of new
methodologies, improved the development plans for the hotel,
catering and tourism programs.
SENAR
(a) the revised approach to training by means of mobile actions on the
part of centers and offices located within all the Federation's
Constituent Units will permit annual enrollments to be increased
in the short term to 125% of the appraisal estimates;
(b)  the  specific  methodology  for   rural vocational  training wss
improved through the training of instructors, preparation of
instructional materials, and purchase of appropriate equipment;
(c) the establishment of centers and offices to provide logistics
support made vocational training more flexible by increasing the
mobility of instructors, equipment and instructional materialsg
and
(d) the delays in the implementation of the SENAR project are
discussed in para. 5.4 above.
FUNDACENTRO31
(a) the establishment of the National Headquarters/Training Center
(11,650 m2) and the regional centers was a decisive factor in
reducing the number of occupational accidents in the country,
11.6% in 1976 to 3.84% in 1984;
(b)  with  the  construction   of  the  national  headquarters/training
center, the project provided FUNDACENTRO with its physical facili-
ties. It also revised its technical and administrative structure,
greatly assisting it in carrying out its activities by providing
it with  laboratories,   classrooms,   lecture  halls  and  other
facilities;
(c) the international fellowships program which was drawn up to serve
the specific needs of the agency's technical staff, provided
solutions  to  the   problems   of  utilization  of  laboratories,
3t Relevant Borrower comments appear as Attachment I.



- 51 -
maintenance, and operations concerned with heslth care and safety
in the workplace; and
(d)  the technical quality  of  the  agency's laboratory equipment, its
library and other resources, have fostered close cooperation with
universities throughout Brazil in the joint study of problem
related to health and occupational safety in the workplace, one of
its functions is to certify the quality of protective equipment.
SINE (National Employment System)
6.12     The technical and  administrative  staff  of  SINE, both at head-
quarters and in the states, was upgraded by means of training programs,
international fellowships and the use of external consultants.
SMO (Secretariat of Nanaower)
(a)  the National Vocational  Training  System  now  has  available an
extensive body of research and studies to guide its policy-making
process and allow it to make its decisions more systematic and
reliable.    Particularly   note   worthy   is   its  research  of
"Employment, Unemployment and Vocational Training," which could be
put into permanent use through the annual processing of data in
RAIS (Annual Social Data Report);
(b)  the  subproject   of   international   fellowships   enhanced  the
Secretariat staff's technical and supervisory capability;
(c)  the  technical  assistance   project   providing  specialists  and
consultants  through  UNDP-ILO   strengthened  activities  in  the
following areass
-    manpower training policies
-    system organization
-    vocational training in firms
-    social development
-    occupational certification
-    vocational information and guidance
costing and financing
B. Experience Acquired
6.13     The  experience  acquired  during   project  execution  should  be
maintained and applied to future projects:
(a) a determining factor in the project's success was the administra-
tive and technical continuity maintained within the PRODEMO
Executive Directorate: most of the personnel that began operations
in 1978 remained in their positions;
(b)  the Special Account  (opened  in  accordance with the December 15,
1982 amendment) should have been established when reimbursements
began to be claimed, and its ceiling adjusted to match changes in
the project;



- 52 -
(c)  the  agencies  participating   in   the   project  and  possessing
technical, teaching and financial autonomy were better able to
implement subprojects than the Government agencies dependent on
reooeiving their allocations from public budgets;
(d) if loan agreements include provision for technical assistance from
international organizations, project units should be more involved
in monitoring and supervisiAg such activities;
(e) construction plans and plans for furniture and equipment procure-
ment should be more closely coordinated, so that bidding proce-
dures can provide for the simultaneous purchase of items with
identical specifications;
(f) the ceiling originally approved by the World Bank for packages
(US$50,000) was inadequate and prevented a more agile implements-
tion of the project, consequently it had to be raised (although
this was uot approved until April 4, 1985);
(g) organizations in process of being established (e.g.,SENAR) cannot
be expected to carry out large-scale projects since they lack the
necessary infrastructure;
(h) agreements should not contain conditions that cannot be fulfilled
during the implementation period (e.g. the follow-up of students);
(i) the requirement of international competitive bidding for civil
works should be eliminated from future loan agreements. However,
local bidding for vehicles and furniture should be retained.
C. Recommendations
6.14     The project implemented  in  accordance  with  the appraisal plan,
only partially strengthened the agencies participating in the National
Vocational Training System,  and  should  be  continued through projects to
increase opportunities for manpower training, in line with Brazil's current
technological level and its likely development. To this end, the following
recommendations are made:
(a)  new SENAC  vocational  training  centers  'CFRs)  should be built,
together with SENAR centers and agencies and FUNDACENTRO regional
centers;
(b) the SENAI centers should be equipped and re-equipped with state-
of-the-art technology. SENAI, SENAC and SENAR should be provided
with mobile units, in light of SENAI's successful experience.
SENAR1s vehicle fleet should be renovated;
(c) the teaching and technical staffs of SENAI, SENAC and SENAR and
the Secretariat of Manpower should be upgraded and strengthened by
continued training. Resources must be increased considerably in
order to satisfy the need for training in advanced technologies;



- 53 -
(d) the international fellowships program should be continued with
substantial increases in financing for short course, longer
(graduate) courses and others;
(e) study and researches subprojects should be continued, and the
findings continuously updated;
(f) the executing agencies should establish their own superviwory
units to coordinate and execute subprojects in-house, keeping
close and regular contact with the central Project Unit;
(g) the exchange of information between the Project Unit and IBRD
should be facilitated with visits to IBRD headquarters at least
twice a year;
(b) IBRD should agree to amendments to agreements within a reasonable
time period in order to avoid delays in the start of projects
prepared by the participating agencies;
(i) price contingencies in new projects should be reduced to reason-
able limits;
(j) proposals should be made to 'he Government for SENAR to be
officially granted financial, administrative and technical auto-
nomy, detaching it from direct administration;
(k) IBRD comments and suggestions on project implementation be based
on a more thorough analysis of the Progress Reports; And
(1)  the composition of  the  technical  staff  in the Supervisory Unit
should be modified, adding more emphasis to vocational training.

Dear Sir:
We have received your letter of January 17, 1989 and its enclosed
Suuwary from the Project Completion Repert on the Vocational Training Project
under Loan 1452-BR.
As stated in the Summary, despite delays and changes, the project
achieved and even surpassed many of its objectives, especially with regard to
maintaining the quality of vocational training, upgrading the level of trained
staff and modernizing physical conditions.
The most significant changes to the Loan were: within SENAC, the
replacement of the hotel training centers with vocational training centers for
training in the hotel and tourism trades at lower cost and with greater
geographical coverage; and within SENAI, the addition of mobile units in all
regions of the country using prototypes developed by the agency and built in
Brazil at competitive prices.
It was possible to raise targets. requiring less funds than
originally envisaged. owing to lower costs than expected for certain project
components,-the devaluation of the cruzeiro in relation to the dollar and the
repayment mechanism used at the time.
SENAR had recruitment and budget difficulties at the start of
project execution, causing appreciable delays. It is suggested that, like
SENAI and SENAC, the agency become more autonomous. It would then be more
flexible, responsive and capable of keeping to timetables.
A major accomplishment of the project unit, which was established
under the Secretary General but has technical, administrative and finanslal
autonomy, was the preparation of the normative documents for Project
implementation, in particular the lists of equipment [for] the bidding
process, in accordance with Brazilian and Bank guidelines.  In most cases,
close coordination of Project implementation with the central offices of the
beneficiary agencies enabled the targets to be met.

The Special Account opened with the Central Bank of Brazil
considerably expedited the reimbursement of expenditures.
Some of the suggestions in the Summary are already being implemented
in the follow-on Vocational Training Project; the project unit was established
under the Secretari&t of Manpower and, like the unit in the first Project,
were established within each agency.*
In accordance with the Constitution of the Federative Republic of
Bra2iil, the National Service for Rural Training (Servigo Nacional de
Aprendizagem Rural -  SENAR) will be established by law along the lines of the
National Service for Industri31 Apprenticeship (Servigo Nacional de
Aprendisagem Industrial - SENAI) and the National Service for Commercial
Apprenticeship Office (Servigo Nacional de Aprendizagem do Com6rcio - SENAC),
without prejudice to the functions of the public entities involved in the area.
Lastly, many Project benefits, already anticipated by all
beneficiary agencies, and a number of positive experiences have been
incorporated in the new Vocational Training Project.
Yours truly,
/s/Joao da Rocha Gomes, Manager
Ministry of Labor/IBRD Vocational Training Project

Draft Project Completion Report
Dear Mr. Donaldson:
With reference to the draft Final Report on Loan Agreement 1452-BR,
transmitted via memorandum of January 17, 1989 for opinion, we have to inform
you as follows:
1.   the Project Management System was modified to avoid setting up a
specific section for that purpose. These activities are currently
carried out through a Management Group (G.-UPO GESZOR), comprising
seconded representatives of the areas involved, without prejudice to
their normal responsibilities, avoiding duality of functions.
2.  Project monitoring will have to be effected by outside auditors,
allowing us better control of activities and any necessary
corrective action.
We also point out that the Final Report omitted to mention the
complete achievement of one of the basic goals of the Project, namely the
training of specialist workers in Occupational Safety, Hygiene and Medicine.
The advanced technical training of our professional staff, together
with the construction and equipping of our Centers, particularly the National
Technical Center (Centro Tecnico Nacional--CTN), made it possible to conduct
approtniately 1,700 courses on the various aspects of the subject, reaching

34,000 workers directly, between 1980 and 1985, in addition to the courses
developed by extension agents, especially in 1st and 2nd grade schools
(Preventive Awareness Project), with the training of 1,558 teachers and 80,410
students in the rudiments of occupational safety, hygiene and medicine. This
information is set forth in Volume I, DESCRIPTION OF FUNDACENTRO, which was
sent to IBRD for authorization of Loan Agreement 2810-BR, approved in 1987.
We shall be happy to furnish any further information you may require.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir:
We have received the Project Completion Report on Loan 1452-BR for
the vocational training project in Brazil, in effect from 1977 to 1985, and
involving SENAI, SENAC, SENAR, FUNDACENTRO, SMO-MTb and SINE.
All the observations therein appear tonUs quite valid, more
specifically those relating to SEMAI as regards the objectives sought, results
achieved and resources assigned and disbursed to maintain and equip the
training centers and the 102 mobile training units and finance the
methodological training of instructors a-ad the fellowships in the areas of
educational orientatlon, food technology, educational technology, and
industrial instrumentation.
Convinced of the usefulness of this experience, we will be careful
to apply it to enhance and guarantee the efficiency of the new projects and
pertinent activities that we are in the process of developing.
Yours, etc.,
