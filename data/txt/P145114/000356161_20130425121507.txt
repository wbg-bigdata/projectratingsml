Objective(s) and         clarify institutional roles and responsibilities for decentralized service delivery
Contribution to CAS      and to enhance public transparency, fiduciary accountability, and local
                         government capacity for improved access to quality services. Therefore, this
                         operation contributes to the two main pillars of the Country Assistance
                         Strategy (CAS) 2008–2012, namely to promote economic transformation and
                         growth, and reduce social vulnerability.
Risks and Risk           Four main risks could jeopardize the expected outcome of the proposed
Mitigation               operation: (i) political risks, (ii) macroeconomic risks, (iii) stakeholder risks,
                         and (iv) program specific risks. The design of the proposed program should
                         help mitigate some of these risks.
                         Political risks. The political situation surrounding Rwanda is fluid.
                         Following the publication of a United Nations (UN) report alleging the
                         Government of Rwanda (Government)’s involvement in the Democratic
                         Republic of Congo (DRC), the international community has reacted by
                         suspending or delaying planned budget support to Rwanda. If the political
                         situation worsens again, it will translate into macroeconomic risks, stakeholder
                         risks and program specific risks.
                         Mitigation. The World Bank is formulating ‘A strategy to support economic
                         development and promote peace and stability in the Great Lakes region’ which
                         proposes specific projects and is expected to help ease tension in the eastern
                         DRC. While this operation cannot directly mitigate the political risks,
                         Rwanda’s sustained development is a prerequisite of regional security and
                         stability. This operation supports important development initiatives of the
                         Government of Rwanda, including improvements in government transparency
                         and accountability.
                                                   v
               Macroeconomic risks. Rwanda’s short to medium/long-term macroeconomic
               outlook is vulnerable to fluctuation in aid flows.             If the ongoing
               suspension/delay in aid continues, the macroeconomic conditions will likely
               worsen and become evident through deterioration in core economic indicators
               (inflation, exchange rates, international reserves, and the budget) in the short-
               term. The short-term impact will in turn hold back progress made in poverty
               reduction and social indicators, and progress of MDGs in the medium to long-
               term.
               Mitigation. The financing provided through this operation will help the
               Government maintain public expenditures in priority areas, as well as ease
               pressures on interest rates, exchange rates, and international reserves in the
               short-term. Therefore, this operation is expected to reduce a systemic risk to
               poverty reduction, MDGs and social indicators in the medium and long-term.
               Stakeholder risks. The suspension/delay in aid has negatively affected the
               policy dialogue between the Government and its development partners. Thus,
               this will undermine a good track record of aid effectiveness and aid
               coordination.
               Mitigation. This operation is the result of close consultations with the
               Government and development partners. This process has enabled the World
               Bank and other development partners to remain engaged in policy reform
               dialogue with the Government, especially during the ongoing finalization of
               the Government’s new strategy (EDPRS II) which will lead into the World
               Bank’s new CAS.
               Program specific risks. The policy reforms supported by this operation as
               well as their respective expected outcomes will be affected by the above
               mentioned risks, including for example the availability of adequate budget
               resources. Program-specific risks include the country’s weak capacity,
               especially for implementing interventions at the local level, and producing
               quality and timely outcome indicators.
               Mitigation. By complementing other Bank operations such as the Second
               Support to the Social Protection System (SSPS-2), this operation will mitigate
               program-specific risks by supporting reforms that will contribute to building
               government capacity and improving social and fiduciary accountability at the
               local level. The World Bank will provide additional support to public sector
               capacity and Government M&E systems through other related ongoing
               operations including the Statistics for Results project (P124129), and
               Governance for Competitiveness Project (P127105).

                                     I.      INTRODUCTION

1.       This program document proposes a ‘Quality of decentralized service delivery support
development policy operation’ (this operation) for a grant in the amount of SDR 33.4 million
(US$50 million equivalent) to the Government of Rwanda (Government). This operation is stand-
alone and supports the Government in implementing its long term Vision 2020 which has been
operationalized through a series of medium term strategies, EDPRS 2. The new EDPRS II covering
2013–18 has an overarching priority theme on strengthening accountable governance through
promoting greater citizen participation in government and enhancing the quality of decentralized
public service delivery. The design of this operation has benefited from close collaboration with the
Government, development partners, Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), and various stakeholders. It
is in full alignment with the CAS 3 and the Bank’s Africa Regional Strategy, with its foundation on
governance and public sector capacity.
2.      The PDO is to support the Government to clarify institutional roles and responsibilities
for decentralized service delivery and to enhance public transparency, fiduciary accountability,
and local government capacity for improved access to quality services. This operation builds on
the decentralization and public sector reforms supported by previous and ongoing World Bank
operations. It targets key medium term challenges to improving the quality of service delivery to
Rwandan citizens. Also, it serves as a transition to the World Bank’s future sectoral and thematic
engagement with Rwanda in this area.
3.       In recognition of the limited citizen participation and ownership of the development
process, the Government has identified the decentralization process as the key focus for its
accountable governance reforms. Starting in 2000, the Government has progressively decentralized
the provision of public services to local governments in order to bring the state closer to its poor
citizens and to improve its accountability to them. Through the reforms supported by this operation,
the Government is seeking to strengthen governance institutions, enhance public accountability and
responsiveness to citizens and improve the transparency of public information to citizens.
4.      Rwanda has restored peace and national security and achieved remarkable development
successes over the last 18 years since the devastating genocide of 1994. The country has achieved
high growth, rapid poverty reduction and, since 2005, reduced inequality. Between 2001 and 2012,
real GDP growth averaged 8.1% per annum. The poverty rate dropped from 59% in 2001 to 45% in
2011. 4 Over this period, Rwanda also made tremendous strides in improving access to basic services.
For example, net enrolment in primary school increased from 76% to 99%, while primary school
completion rates more than tripled from 24% to 79%. Similarly, child mortality decreased more than
threefold (from 196 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 54 in 2012), due to increased access to
health care and improved proximity of health centers to residential areas.
5.      While Rwanda has made great strides towards addressing its development challenges, it
remains among the world’s poorest countries: about 45% of the population lives below the poverty
line and 24% are extremely poor 5. Furthermore, while the poverty headcount is relatively low in
urban areas at 22%, it is on average 49% outside the capital and reaches 73% in Nyaruguru district.
Child malnutrition continues to affect a significant number of Rwandans: 44% of children under the
age of 5 are stunted. Health insurance coverage and usage of district hospitals have increased but

   Rwanda’s poverty line is Rwf 64,000 (US$100) per year at constant January 2001 prices, equivalent to
Rwf118,000 (US$185) at 2011 prices. Its extreme poverty line represents the level of expenditure needed to
provide the minimum food requirement of 2,100 Kcal per adult per day which is Rwf 45,000 (US$71) at
constant January 2001 prices. If the World Bank’s international poverty line ($1.25 a day) is applied, the
poverty rate is 63.2% in 2011.

remain negatively correlated with poverty status, and so is usage of other services provided by local
administrations. Similarly, while agricultural productivity has increased significantly, households that
rely on farm wage labor continue to be among the poorest and have largely missed out on the benefits
arising from the poverty reduction trend over the last 10 years. By bringing government closer to
citizens, decentralization has a potential to better target poverty reduction within the country.
6.       The Government is currently embarking on an ambitious third phase of decentralization
(2011-2015). The overall objective is to improve the targeting of service provision to meet the needs
of the poor by empowering sub-national levels of the government that have the best knowledge of
their district poverty reduction and service delivery needs. 6 For this objective, there is a strong
emphasis on capacity development and organizational reform to facilitate this deepening and to also
build the fiduciary and social accountability processes to deliver improved quality services and enable
greater fiscal autonomy of local governments in the medium term. Equally, the Government
recognizes that the policy and legal framework for decentralization needs to be updated and enhanced,
particularly in view of the need for greater clarity on the respective roles and responsibilities of the
central and the local government levels and for improving the functioning of the various institutions
within local government.
7.       The Bank proposes this operation under challenging circumstances and a fluid aid
environment. Following the publication of a UN report alleging Government involvement in the
DRC, development partners have suspended or delayed planned budget support to Rwanda equivalent
to 11% of the budget in the first half of FY2012/13. Through fiscal and monetary policy measures, the
Government has successfully limited the impact of the aid shortfall on the economy and poverty
reduction. However, the impacts have started to be felt in exchange rates, interest rates and
international reserves, and the continuation of the aid shortfall is likely to be translated into a
deceleration in growth and poverty reduction. In addition, effective policy dialogue between the
Government and development partners through the Budget Support Harmonization Group (BSHG) has
been affected by the challenging environment.
8.       In addition to supporting the Government’s policies to enhance decentralized service
delivery, this operation helps mitigate the short term economic and social impacts of the aid
shortfall, prevent a spillover effect to poverty reduction and MDGs in the medium/long-term,
and sustain policy dialogue on accountable governance and service delivery during the crucial
period of EDPRS II preparation. The financing provided through this operation will help the
Government maintain public expenditures and service delivery in priority areas that are relevant for
poverty reduction. In addition, while a lack of financial resources may also reduce the Government’s
ability to implement planned reforms, this operation will help the Government maintain momentum in
important reform areas such as capacity building, public financial management (PFM) and social
accountability. Moreover, it will complement the Bank’s engagement in supporting improved service
delivery through other investment and policy based operations. Finally, it will help sustain the Bank’s
close work with other development partners through the Joint Budget Support Review dialogue.
9.       The Bank’s medium-term engagement with the Government on decentralized
governance will be articulated further in the next CAS. While further progress in the policy areas
to be supported by this operation will require medium/long-term engagements by the Bank and other
development partners, this operation is stand-alone for three reasons. First, despite not being formally
part of a broader program, this operation is strongly linked to various past and ongoing Bank
interventions. In particular, this operation capitalizes on the achievements of the Decentralization and
Community Development Project (DCDP), the past Poverty Reduction Support Financing (PRSF)
series, the Public Sector Capacity Building Project and the SSPS. Second, in light of the rapidly
changing circumstances surrounding Rwanda, this operation serves as a transition to the Bank’s future
engagement with the country in this area, which could potentially be based on different instruments

 For example, all districts have prepared their own District Development Plans for 2013–2018 to specify their
medium term growth and poverty reduction goals.

(e.g. Program-for-Results or Investment loans). Third, the instruments to be utilized in the Bank’s
future engagement with Rwanda in order to follow up on this operation will be better articulated in the
next CAS covering the next 3-5 years. The next CAS will be presented to the Board in FY2014 after
the Government finalizes the EDPRS II in mid-2013.

                                  II.      COUNTRY CONTEXT

A. RECENT POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN RWANDA

10.     Over the past 18 years, the international community has provided strong support to
Rwanda’s progress in growth and poverty reduction. Aid has supported major reforms in economic
policy making. Development partners have also supported important sector programs, which have led
to remarkable achievements in agricultural productivity – the main driver of poverty reduction in
Rwanda - and health outcomes. Aid has become a very important financing source, accounting for
approximately 40% of the budget.
11.     Donor support has recently been suspended or delayed following a UN report which
alleged violation by the Government of a UN Security Council resolution establishing arms
embargo on all foreign and Congolese forces in eastern DRC. The continued conflict in the eastern
DRC constitutes one of the world’s most severe crises. Notwithstanding the signing of different peace
agreements in the past and the deployment of a large peacekeeping force under a UN mandate, the
eastern DRC has continued to suffer from recurring cycles of conflict and persistent violence by a
large number of armed groups, with often devastating consequences for the population. In November
2012, the Group of Experts on the DRC (appointed pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution
1533/2004) issued a report (S/2012/843) in which it alleged violation of the arms embargo and
sanctions regime by the Rwandan Government contrary to UN Security Council Resolution 1807
(2008). The June 2012 interim version of this report led many development partners to suspend their
aid to Rwanda, in particular in the form of budget support. The World Bank did not present to its
Board for approval the PRSF9, a large general budget support operation and a central piece of its
support program to Rwanda.
12.     While the environment surrounding Rwanda is fluid, positive signs have recently
emerged. In February 2013, a new peace and security framework agreement to stabilize the eastern
part of DRC was signed in Addis Ababa by eleven Heads of States of the International Conference on
the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) and officiated by Ban Ki-moon, the UN Secretary-General, and
Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Under the new
agreement, countries in the Great Lakes have committed to refrain from interfering in internal affairs
of neighboring countries while the Congolese government has agreed to fast-track security sector
reform, particularly within its army and police, and to consolidate state authority in eastern parts of the
country. It also pledged to prevent armed groups from destabilizing neighboring countries. Some
development partners such as the African Development Bank 7 have resumed their assistance and the
Board of Directors of the World Bank recently approved SSPS-2 amounting US$50 million.
13.      The World Bank is formulating a strategy to support economic development and
promote peace and stability in the Great Lakes region. The Bank’s formulation of a Strategy for
the Great Lakes Region coincides with the peace deal signed in February 2013 by regional heads of
states, with the objective of ending two decades of conflict in the east of the DRC. Advancing social
and economic development in a way that addresses underlying causes of the conflict is critical for
achieving and sustaining peace in the region. In particular, sub-regional integration and cooperation
among the countries of the Great Lakes region can be an important contributor to their economic

development and indirectly contribute to sustained peace and stability. The Strategy being formulated
aims to support integrative policies that will reduce conflict risks through two main pillars of (i)
reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing resilience and (ii) promoting economic opportunities and
integration. Across these two pillars, the Strategy emphasizes support to strengthened governance and
public sector capacity. It builds on a robust regional knowledge platform to inform envisaged
operations and the broader regional policy agenda. The Bank is particularly well-placed in the areas of
(i) re-prioritizing and scaling-up investments in infrastructure and related sectoral polices, with a focus
on connecting countries through better transport, energy and IT linkages; (ii) intensifying support for
improved improving governance (including rebuilding key state institutions and enhanced attention to
mining, decentralization, and beneficiary participation and other demand side initiatives) with a focus
on eastern DRC and borders between countries; (iii) facilitating intra-regional trade and agricultural
development and (iv) advancing social welfare, with sensitivity to gender, through access to health and
education, social protection and effective re-integration of combatants.

B. GOVERNANCE
14.     Rwanda scores highly and leads in the East African Community (EAC) on two
governance aspects of the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators: government
effectiveness and control of corruption. As part of its development vision, the Government has
pursued vigorously a zero tolerance approach to corruption which has been fundamental to the strong
growth and service delivery performance recorded over the past decade. Prior to 1994, the Rwandan
public administration had a reputation for pervasive corruption. 8 A raft of oversight institutions have
been established to control corruption and promote integrity, including the Office of the Auditor
General (1998), the Office of the Ombudsman, the Rwandan Public Procurement Agency, and most
recently a new Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (2011) as well as a Public Procurement
Appeals Commission. There is a constitutionally upheld asset declaration process for public officials
(although this is not public). Transparency International (TI) has ranked Rwanda as the least corrupt
country in EAC and among the least corrupt in Africa. In TI’s Corruption Perceptions Index, Rwanda
is ranked 50th in the world and it is the 4th best performing country in Africa and the best in East
Africa.
15.     However, Rwanda performs less well on Worldwide Governance Indicators of voice and
accountability, i.e. the extent to which citizens of a country are able to participate in selecting their
government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of association and a free media. The
Economist Intelligence Unit democracy index ranks Rwanda 136 out of 167 countries. As the
Government’s Decentralization Sector Strategic Plan 2013-17 notes, ‘participation through decision
making and, demanding for accountability from leadership is still low as illustrated by the 2010
Citizen Report Card. Links between citizens and Members of Parliament (MPs) are also relatively
nascent. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation’s Index of African Governance ranks Rwanda 29 out of 52
countries (score of 43.2) on participation and human rights, below the Africa average of 47.6 points.
The Constitution upholds a free press and a number of private radio stations operate in Rwanda.
However the media sector is relatively weak and the Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without
Borders ranks Rwanda 156 out of 178 countries for 2011/12 and Freedom House ranks Rwanda 178
out of 197 countries in its 2012 World Press Freedom Index.

C. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN RWANDA

16.     While Rwanda has a good track-record of macroeconomic management, its strong
economic performance is being clouded by the ongoing aid shortfall. The authorities have quickly
and adequately responded to the aid shortfall by securing alternative financing sources for the budget
and prioritizing expenditures. While the recent authorities’ responses have demonstrated prudent
macroeconomic management, Rwanda’s macroeconomic outlook is highly dependent on the timing
8
    JGA 2008 p. 53.
                                                    4
and amounts of aid flows. Under a scenario which incorporates this operation and the disbursement of
a AfDB budget support operation, the shortfall of aid in FY2012/13 would be of US$104 million in
comparison to the original budget. Under that scenario, the growth outlook would remain positive with
growth projected at 7% in 2013 before recovering to a robust 7.5% in 2014. However, if the aid
shortfall in the current fiscal year were to widen to US$194 million, projected growth in 2013 would
be 6.2%. Under this assumption, the Government would be forced to reduce expenditures in social
and infrastructure programs, with direct and indirect short term impacts on the well-being of the poor,
including through reduced income and access to basic services.
THE REAL SECTOR
17.     The economy successfully weathered           Figure 1: GDP growth and contribution by
the global financial crisis. In the past decade      sector (%)
average real growth exceeded eight percent.
The economy has kept its growth momentum
in recent years (Figure 1). The growth rate
decelerated to 6.2% in 2009 due to the global
financial crisis, but accelerated to 8.2% in
2011 and 8.0% in 2012 led by the service
sector. The high growth rate of the industry
sector (11% per annum) was mostly led by
construction, whereas manufacturing growth
averaged a much lower 4.7% and accounted
for only 6% of GDP.
18.      High services growth continued in
2012. The economy’s 8.0% growth in 2012 Source: National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR)
made Rwanda the strongest performer in the East African Community (EAC peers) 9 and one of the
fastest-growing economies in the world. The service sector contributed 5.6% to the overall growth
rate followed by industry (1.1%) and agriculture (1.0%). Within services, the trade, transportation and
communication, and hotel and restaurant sub-sectors were especially strong. On the other hand, in the
industry sector, mining (-9.8%) and manufacturing (-2.9%) experienced negative growth rates. The
contraction of mining was due to low international prices and weak tin production, and that of
manufacturing was due to higher electricity costs, which increased by 20% since July 2012.
FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS
19.      Rwanda’s budget is characterized by a high aid share in revenue and grants, and a
significant share of transfers to local governments in expenditures. In the FY2011/12 budget
realization, the share of grants reached 43.6% of total revenues and grants. The size of aid relative to
GDP was 11.1% and slightly lower than that of tax revenues (13.5%) (Table 1). In expenditures, the
progress of decentralization has pushed the share of transfers to districts. In the FY2011/12 budget
realization, transfers to districts reached 20.5% of total expenditures, which is almost equivalent to
domestic and foreign capital expenditures.

FY2012/13: US$146 million out of US$391 million. The gap between expected and actual aid is
equivalent to 11.4% of the original FY2012/13 budget.
22.      In the first half of FY2012/13, the Government responded to the aid shortfall by cutting
or delaying expenditures (Table 1). The Government postponed some capital projects in the first
quarter of FY2012/13, but ensured the execution of non-discretionary expenditures such as salaries
and wages, interest payments and transfers to districts. As a result, the overall budget execution rate in
the first half of the fiscal year was 90%. On the financing side, the Government increased domestic
borrowing (through the issuance of T-bills and accumulation of domestic arrears). The domestic
arrears outstanding reached Rwf 34.4 billion (US$50 million or 0.7% of GDP) in December 2012 but
have declined to an average of Rwf 10.1 billion (US$16 million or 0.2% of GDP) between January
and March 2013, mainly due to continued deceleration in capital expenditures and increased issuance
of T-bills.
23.     The FY2012/13 budget was revised in February 2013. The Government identified
expenditure cuts of about one percent of GDP, which will result in the reduction of domestic arrears to
almost zero by June 2013. Furthermore, the revised budget includes contingent expenditures of Rwf
107.6 billion (2.3% of GDP) whose implementation would be subject to the disbursement of additional
budget support, including from the World Bank and the African Development Bank.
EXTERNAL SECTOR DEVELOPMENTS
24.     Rwanda’s current account relies heavily on foreign assistance (Table 2). The current
account deficit reached 7.3% of GDP in 2011 (19% of GDP without current transfers). Yet, between
2009 and 2011, the cumulative Balance of Payments (BoP) reached $455 million and as a result
foreign reserves increased from $744 million in 2009 to $1,050 million in 2011.
25.      In 2012 the widening of the current account deficit pushed the BoP into deficit for the
first time since 2003, reducing international reserves by almost 20% to around US$845 million
by end-2012. The combination of the decline in aid and an expansion in the trade deficit has pushed
the BoP from a surplus in 2011 (3.7% of GDP) to a deficit of US$212 million (3.0% of GDP) in 2012.
The current account deficit has widened to an estimated 11.4% of GDP in 2012, its highest level in
more than 20 years. Aside from the decline in aid, the spike in global financial market volatility in
early 2012 resulted in a reduction in foreign demand for Rwandan Government sovereign debt

compared to 2011 12. On the positive side, foreign direct investment (FDI) has continued to rise
―predominantly to the mineral and hotel and leisure sectors 13― and is estimated to have reached
US$166 million in 2012. To offset net capital outflows, during 2012 the Banque Nationale du
Rwanda (BNR), the central bank, ran down international reserves to US$690 million as of end-
February 2013, or about 3.4 months of imports. The reduced scope of the authorities to intervene
highlights the ongoing vulnerability of the country’s external accounts.
26.     While aid has significantly declined since mid-2012, both exports and imports have
continued to rise. Export earnings are estimated to have expanded to US$ 591 million in 2012, with
annual growth of 27.3% outpacing growth in imports 14. Despite the strong growth in exports in 2012,
and because of their much lower initial base, the trade deficit widened to US$1,376 million in 2012
(20% of GDP), up from US$1,102 million in 2011 (17.3% of GDP). 15

2013 (Figure 3). The real effective exchange rate        -2.0

depreciated by 2% in 2012, compared to an
appreciation of 0.7% in 2011. The depreciation Source: Central Bank of Rwanda
was mainly due to lower inflation in Rwanda
compared to the nation’s major trading partners, as well as a nominal depreciation of the Rwf against
the US dollar. The Rwandan franc has been relatively stable in the first three months of 2013
depreciating only by 0.5%, a similar depreciation level as in the same period a year ago.
31.     Credit growth to the private sector supported high growth in 2012. Credit growth reached
more than 30% in 2012 and decelerated only slightly in early 2013 (29.1% y-o-y in February 2013).
Private sector activities backed by high credit growth have thus far supported the economy.
32.     Both headline and core inflation rates decreased in the second half of 2012, but import
prices started to rise (Figure 4). The headline inflation rate fell to 3.9% (year-on-year) by December
2012, and core inflation fell to 2.5%. The food inflation rate, accounting for 35% of the price basket,
remained high at eight percent. While headline and core inflation rates remained low in the second
half of 2012, the weakening currency has started to affect inflation in import prices, which accounts
for 20% of the price basket and reached 3.2% in December 2012.

D. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

33.      While the medium-term economic outlook remains positive, growth is likely to decelerate
in 2013 before recovering in 2014. Bank staff estimates that Rwanda’s economy will grow 7% in
2013, assuming a budget support shortfall of US$104 million relative to the original budget in
FY2012/13. If aid flows recover in FY2013/14, growth would accelerate to a robust 7.5% in 2014.
The projected slowdown in 2013 growth would be driven mainly by lower public expenditures as a
result of the aid shortfall. While government actions have so far limited the impact of the aid shortfall
on the economy, the reduction in public expenditures will begin to have a noticeable spill-over into
related private sector activities. Service sectors, in particular, are expected to slow down, especially
those with stronger links to public expenditures. As foreign assistance inflows begin to be partially
disbursed throughout 2013, the current account deficit is projected to decline slightly to 10.2% of
GDP. The inflation rate is projected to remain moderate.
34.      However, under an alternative scenario in which the aid shortfall reaches US$194
million, the 2013 growth rate would decelerate to 6.2%. Under this scenario, the Government
efforts to reduce poverty and protect the provision of basic services will be further undermined. The
reduction in public expenditures will have a direct impact on growth and poverty reduction. The
deceleration of capital expenditures, for example, will affect employment in the construction sector,
while further cuts in current expenditures will erode the economy’s overall job creation capacity.
Pressure on exchange rates will be translated into higher inflation rates, which will affect the poor
disproportionately. In addition, further widening of current account deficits will result in a loss of
foreign reserves, which will increase the country’s vulnerability to external shocks. If and when the

                                                   8
latter were to materialize, their negative social impact would be amplified through the above
mentioned transmission mechanisms (lower social expenditures and job creation and higher inflation).
35.      Rwanda’s debt dynamics remain sustainable. In the most recent Debt Sustainability
Analysis (DSA) update of May 2012 the present value of external debt to GDP ratio is projected to
improve from 19% in 2012 to 17% in 2015. Similarly, the present value of public debt to GDP ratio is
projected to decline from 37% in 2012 to 26% in 2015. Under the most extreme stress test, which
involves a one-time 30% depreciation of the nominal exchange rate in 2013, the present value of the
external debt to GDP ratio could increase to 24% in 2013 but then fall to 22% in 2015. Similarly, the
ratio of public debt to GDP would increase to 41% in 2013 but then fall to 33% by 2015. Rwanda’s
risk of debt distress is rated as moderate rather than low on account of the vulnerabilities associated
with the country’s limited export base. Rwanda’s capacity for macroeconomic and public financial
management has been upgraded from low to high.
36.      BoP vulnerability is expected to decline in the medium term. In the near term, the current
account balance will depend on aid inflows. The current account is expected to remain in deficit over
the medium term, but deficits are expected to narrow as some of the large strategic investment projects
come to completion. Exports continue to be vulnerable to fluctuations in international commodity
prices, intensified by the narrow export base. The Government expects that the implementation of the
recently-approved National Export Strategy, which provides a framework for increasing exports, will
yield early results in terms of the diversification of exports. The import bill is expected to decline in
coming years due to the declining need for capital goods, because many of the large strategic
investment projects have been, or will soon be, completed.
37.      The BNR is closely monitoring monetary and exchange rate risks. The Rwandan Franc
could depreciate further and inflation could rise due to growing import prices. Food inflation will also
need to be carefully monitored, given that it has been in double digits over the first 10 months of 2012.
However, the BNR is expected to implement policies to minimize risks of monetary inflation while
supporting the Government economic growth objective. In particular, the BNR will increasingly focus
on a wider set of indicators – linked to economic activity as well as interest and exchange rate
developments – in order to anchor inflation expectations and move to a more flexible monetary
targeting framework by introducing a reserve money band of ±2% around the central reserve money
target. This framework will attempt to guide banking liquidity and short-term interest rates to move in
line with the targeted monetary policy stance.
38.      Risk of policy instability remains low. Rwanda has a good track-record of macroeconomic
management which has resulted in strong economic performance in the past decade. Rwanda has
managed aid effectively and has used them for productive public investment and public services. The
authorities’ fiscal and monetary policy reactions to the recent aid shortfall have further exemplified
their macroeconomic management capacity and policy coherence.
39.      Financial sector risks have been reduced through ongoing efforts to strengthen banking
regulation and supervision. The process of amending the banking law and its implementing
regulations following the 2011 Financial Stability Assessment Program 17 is expected to be concluded
by end-2013. In 2012, the capitalization level as measured by total capital to risk weighted assets,
stood at 23.9%, well above the Rwanda’s regulatory minimum capital of 15% and above the new 10%
Basel Committee Benchmark. The quality of banks’ loan portfolios continued to improve as the ratio
of non-performing loans (NPLs) in gross loans continued to show a downward trend. The NPL ratio
has steadily declined from 11.3% in December 2010 to 8.2% in December 2011, and further to 6.1%
in December 2012. To better monitor financial market conditions and risks, the BNR created the FSC
in July 2012.
40.  In the medium term, in order to accelerate growth and further poverty reduction,
Rwanda faces the challenge of reducing its reliance on aid, as well as improving job creation and

competitiveness. In order to bolster its resilience to diminishing aid flows, Rwanda is expected to
continue expanding its domestic tax base and further strengthen its financial system’s ability to
mobilize savings and spur private sector investment. In addition to the growing service sector,
agriculture is another area where Rwanda has substantial capacity to build on current success and
continue expanding productivity and job creation, including in off-farm activities. Job creation will
also benefit from Rwanda’s growing investments in upgrading the skills of its labor force. Finally,
Rwanda faces the challenge of making the most of growing regional stability and economic
integration, which will be fundamental for accelerating the country’s development path towards its
objective of achieving medium income status in the next decade.
41.     The Bank considers the country’s macroeconomic framework to be appropriate for
development policy lending. Rwanda’s track record of prudent macroeconomic policies is evidenced
by the transition to PSI-based IMF support in 2010. Rwanda successfully completed the fifth review
of the Policy Support Instrument (PSI) in November 2012. While the recent aid shortfall has brought
increasing macroeconomic management challenges and uncertainties for the macroeconomic outlook,
the authorities have quickly and adequately responded to the challenges.

E. POVERTY PROFILE AND MDG ACHIEVEMENTS

42.      Poverty has significantly declined in Rwanda over the past decade, but challenges
remain (Annex 3). While the poverty headcount (the proportion of the population living below the
national poverty line) decreased by 14 percentage points between 2001 and 2011, 45% of the
population lives below the poverty line. 18 Therefore, despite the drop in poverty, Rwanda is unlikely
to achieve the 2015 MDG-1 target for poverty and hunger eradication (Annex 5) 19. The poverty
headcount is much higher in rural areas (49%) than urban areas (22%). Extreme poverty (the fraction
of the population living below the food poverty line) dropped by 16 percentage points over the past
decade, but 24% of the population was still in extreme poverty in 2011. Inequality slightly improved,
reflected in a Gini coefficient of 0.49 in 2011 compared to 0.52 in 2006. The decline in poverty
occurred during a period of high growth rates in Rwanda but also during intermittent periods of food
price inflation.
43.      While notable progress has been made in a wide range of health and primary education
indicators, children malnutrition and stunting remains a very serious health problem (Annex 5).
The 2009 Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA) and Nutrition Survey
showed that Rwanda has made progress in terms of increasing food security but indicated that more
investments are needed to sustain this progress. It is notable that the observed decline in poverty
between 2006 and 2011 was accompanied by a decline in the proportion of female-headed households
among the poorest income quintiles. This appears to show that female-headed households are
becoming less vulnerable, which corroborates the excellent performance of Rwanda with regard to the
achievement of MDG-3 on gender equality. 20 With regard to MDG-7 on environmental sustainability,
Rwanda’s natural resources are under pressure from the growing population, which is most evident in
land degradation, soil erosion, declines in soil fertility, deforestation, wetland degradation, and a loss
of biodiversity. Further economic development will increase environmental pressures by increasing
energy consumption, pollution, and urbanization. Progress in increasing the proportion of the
population that has access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation facilities is still too slow to
reach the set targets.
44.     The 2010 Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the EICV3 have shown that
maternal and child health has improved dramatically, and HIV prevalence has been contained at 3%
since 2005. Under-five mortality decreased more than threefold since the early 2000s, hitting the mark
of a two-thirds reduction in child mortality targeted by MDG 4. Progress in health indicators was
mainly sustained by increased access to health care, largely due to the increased proximity of health
centers to residential areas. However, more progress still needs to be made with respect to nutrition.
Nationwide, 44% of children under the age of 5 are stunted, and 17% are severely stunted. In regard to
education, Rwanda has made progress in expanding access, with net primary school enrollment having
increased from 76% in 2001 to 99% in 2011. Also, the primary school completion rate increased from
24% in 2001 to 79% in 2011. If this progress continues, there is a possibility of the related MDG
target being achieved by 2015. However, indicators for secondary and tertiary education are still

   Within education, gender parity in literacy rates and gender enrollment parity at the primary level have been
achieved. Within the public arena, the number of woman in politics, parliament, and all decision-making bodies
has sharply increased over the last decade, supported by the government’s target of 30% female representation.
For example, to date, women hold 56% of the seats in Rwanda's Parliament, the highest percentage of female
lawmakers in the world.

school pupil to qualified teacher ratio stood at 62:1 in 2011/12. 21

47.      Similary, there is great inequality to access to services across Districts. For example,
usage of sector administration provided by sub-district varies from 6% in Rusizi District to 98% in
Nyabihu District (Table 5 and Annex 4). Large differences across districts are also observed in access
to health services (e.g. health centers and district hospitals). The large inequality across districts
reiterates the importance of bringing the state closer to citizens.

III.     THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSESES

48.     Good governance and a capable state is the first pillar of Rwanda’s long term Vision
2020 strategy that is focused on the country becoming a lower middle income economy by 2020.
The pillar espouses the importance of strengthening accountability, transparency and efficiency in
deploying scarce resources. Central to the Vision 2020 is the national decentralization process adopted
in May 2000 with the aim of promoting greater government accountability to citizens, local economic

development, national unity, and improved service delivery. The policy is significant given the
country’s history of highly centralized rule prior to 1994.
49.     Accountable governance also constitutes one of the four overarching pillars of the draft
EDPRS II, which underlines a strong concern to improve the quality of service delivery and
enhance citizen participation and ownership in the development process. The other three
overarching development goals in the EDPRS II are: (i) economic transformation; (ii) rural
development; and (iii) enhanced productivity and youth employment. During the EDPRS II period,
the Government proposes to strengthen various accountability initiatives. These include home grown
participatory mechanisms such as District Joint Action Development Forums (JADF), public
accountability days, the Umuganda monthly community development exercises, and the National
Dialogue process; as well as formal mechanisms such as the Office of the Ombudsman and its
associated nationwide system for filing grievances and complaints; and service delivery charters to
inform citizens of public service standards, as well as the use of ICT to engage citizens in feedback.
Consolidating decentralization and PFM are foundational cross cutting issues that will be addressed in
the EDPRS II.
50.      Rwanda initiated Decentralization in 2000 following a series of nationwide consultations
as a means to strengthen national unity and reconciliation and bring government closer to
citizens and was enshrined in the new Constitution of 2003. It was part of a significant public
sector reform process that sought to enhance government productivity and efficiency by substantially
downsizing the administration, establishing a raft of new agencies and decentralized entities to lead on
service delivery implementation, and instilling codes of ethics, standardized recruitment procedures
and improved pay and skills. Decentralization has since become a cornerstone of the Government’s
national development policy.
51.      The Government has implemented decentralization in an incremental and phased
approach. In the first phase between 2001 and 2006, the focus was on establishing five levels of
government; namely: central government, provinces (12), districts (106), sub-districts (1,545) and
cells (9,165) and democratic and community development structures at the local government level.
There were a number of legal, institutional and policy reforms, as well as the establishment of
democratic local elections. All local leaders have been elected since the Constitution was finalized in
2003. Unlike village and cell level elections, sub-district and district elections are secret. The
candidates are elected indirectly by the cell and sub-district councilors respectively. A further
restructuring was implemented in 2005, and sub national administrations were thus reduced to 4
provinces, 30 districts, 416 sub-districts, 21,480 cells and 14,975 Imidugudu (villages).
52.      The second phase of decentralization (2006–2011) saw a greater increase in total
transfers to districts, which reached 25% of total domestic revenues in 2006, and a concomitant
attempt to build more capacity in local government institutions to enhance service delivery
implementation and boost local economic development. A key instrument to this end was the
introduction of performance contracts signed by District Mayors and the President – a system known
as Imihigo (Box 1). In addition the government established systems for community mobilization and
participation. However, overall capacities remained limited and the government initiated training
programs to build skills in the newly established institutions, including through a Multi Sector
Capacity Building Program beginning in 2005 as a long term Strategic Framework to guide and direct
public sector capacity development activities, and programs run by the new Rwanda Institute of
Administration and Management. This was followed by a PFM Reform Strategy of 2008–2012 and a
set of second generation public administration reforms that sought to inter alia reform pay structures
and introduce an Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) to strengthen human
resource management. By 2010/11, sub national government staff was almost on a par with that for
the central government (respectively 8,549 and 10,284 employees) and a state system was in place at
all the sub national levels – Province, District, sub-district, cell and village with an elected council at
each of the levels. Although only 10% of mayors were women in 2012, approximately 43% of local

                                                    13
government positions are held by women and the Constitution upholds that women shall constitute not
less than 30 percent of leadership positions at all levels.
Box 1: Rwanda’s system of Performance Contracts (the Imihigo process)
Introduced at the inception of the second phase of decentralization, the first Imihigo were signed between the
President of the Republic and District Mayors in 2006. The Imihigo then became an annual undertaking through
which local governments articulate their own objectives which reflect priorities of their local citizenry, and set
strategies to achieve the objectives. Derived from the traditional practice where individuals voluntarily set their
own targets and publicly committed to achieve them within time bound periods, the revived concept aims to
strengthen participatory priority setting, bottom-up planning and accelerate implementation while focusing on
time bound results. The Imihigo are set yearly, but evaluated every six months. The process is credited for
strengthening the focus on results, enhancing budget execution rates, and improving local government planning,
implementation and reporting. Like other processes at the local government level, a number of areas are
outlined as needing improvements to further facilitate efficiency and effectiveness of the Imihigo: these include
strengthening predictability of planning; monitoring and evaluation; and increasing district resources potential
to enable them commit realistically [Decentralization Policy – 2013; Annual Evaluation of Imihigo – 2011/13].

53.     In terms of fiscal decentralization, financial resources to local government have
increased substantially since the second phase of decentralization (Table 6 and Annex 6) 22.
Transfers from the central government to districts increased from 1.4% of domestic revenues in 2002
to 33.3% in 2011/12, of which 80% are earmarked funds and 14% are discretionary block grants23.
While the tax base at the local level remains limited, MINECOFIN intends to increase local
government revenues according to the draft Decentralization Sector Plan FY2013-17. The goal is to
improve district autonomy and generate additional resources for local economic development.

54.     Looking ahead, the Government recognizes that although the last decade of
decentralization implementation has resulted in major positive developments, much remains to
be done to reach the country’s goals in terms of democratic, participatory local governance and
effective citizen-centered service delivery. For example, although some sectors have gone far in
decentralizing activities from the central level, for example agriculture, education and health, overall

   The Bank intends to conduct further analytical work and maintain its policy dialogue on this topic to support
further improvement in the fiscal decentralization framework.
23
   The division of transfers across districts is based on population, poverty, number of sub-district and surface
areas.
                                                        14
the roles and responsibilities between the center and the local levels of government require more
clarity and definition and some sectors have not yet fully decentralized.
55.     One of key priorities in EDPRS II is to further improve the quality of service delivery.
This will require both greater administrative capacity – building skills, planning, M&E and PFM
systems – and strengthened accountability for performance at the local level of government which is
the focus of service delivery implementation. Sub national capacity building and PFM are considered
foundational cross-cutting issues that need to be addressed to improve decentralized service delivery.
The new PFM government strategy of 2013/14–2017/18 prioritizes support to fiscal decentralization
as well as the development of human resources and capacity building in PFM. Similarly, the need for a
stronger focus on building public sector capacity at the district and sub-district levels has been one of
the key lessons emerging from EDPRS I and the evaluation of the second phase of decentralization.
Two key challenges identified in the EDPRS self-assessment evaluation are: (i) to improve linkages
between central and local government planning; and (ii) to provide implementation support matching
the responsibilities allocated to sub national governments. Moreover, strengthening public sector
capacity through skills enhancement and technical assistance is upheld as a key cross cutting EDPRS
II priority under the leadership of the Public Sector Capacity Building Secretariat which is
implementing a national Strategic Capacity Building Initiative (SCBI) to build skills in four priority
areas of agriculture, energy, mining and private sector investment as well as disseminating tools and
guidance to enhance the quality and impact of capacity development activities including at the local
government level.
56.      The government’s latest third phase of decentralization (2011–2015) is ambitious in
seeking to extend the range of services decentralized to local government, while also deepening
decentralization to sub-district levels. There is a strong emphasis on stepping up a strategic approach
to capacity development and organizational reform to facilitate this deepening and to also build the
fiduciary and social accountability processes to deliver improved quality services to citizens and
enable greater fiscal autonomy of local governments in the medium term. Equally, the government
recognizes that the policy and legal framework for decentralization needs to be updated and enhanced,
particularly in view of the need for greater clarity on the respective roles and responsibilities of the
central and the local government levels and on the functioning of the various institutions within local
government.

            IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

A. LINK TO CAS

57.       This operation is in alignment with the CAS and supports the Government’s vision of
Rwanda becoming a middle-income economy by 2020. The CAS is framed around two strategic
pillars: (i) promoting economic transformation and growth and (ii) reducing social vulnerability. It is
closely aligned with EDPRS I (2008-13) and follows the Government’s preferences for engaging with
the Bank in coordination with other development partners (Annex 9). This operation is aligned with
EDPRS II, and is thus likely to be strongly consistent with the new CAS which will be finalized in
FY2014. As mentioned above, an overarching priority theme of EDPRS II is strengthening of
accountable governance and improving decentralized service delivery, including through increased
capacity development efforts.
58.     By supporting policies aimed at increasing the quality of decentralized service delivery,
this operation contributes directly to service delivery outcomes in both CAS strategic pillars and
particularly supports the Outcome 1.4 on ‘Management of Public Resources at Central and
Local Levels Strengthened’. Under this outcome area, the Bank committed to increase the emphasis
on building PFM capacity at decentralized levels and to support policy development for Rwanda’s
intergovernmental fiscal transfer system to help clarify responsibilities for service delivery. The CAS
                                                   15
also identified the lack of capacity, particularly at decentralized levels, as a key risk to manage through
a cross-cutting approach tackling public sector management and the mainstreaming of capacity
development across all operations.
59.     The 2011 CAS Progress Report confirmed that Rwanda’s progress towards achieving
the CAS outcomes has been largely positive although important challenges remain. The CAS
Progress Report also adjusted the CAS Program by emphasizing a more strategic approach to capacity
strengthening. The EDPRS was extended by one year until June 2013 – and with it the CAS. Going
forward, the strategic approach to capacity building remains highly relevant and might be emphasized
even further as evident from the draft EDPRS II.

B. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

60.       The Bank and the IMF continue to work closely to ensure coordination and consistency
in their macroeconomic and structural policy programs. While the IMF advises the Government
on the size of the spending envelope in its budget discussions, the Bank focuses its attention on the
composition of spending and its alignment with the EDPRS. In June 2010, the IMF approved a three-
year PSI for Rwanda. It aims to consolidate macroeconomic stability while reducing Rwanda’s aid
dependency by: (i) maintaining a sustainable fiscal position through increased revenue mobilization;
(ii) strengthening monetary and exchange rate policies to ensure low and stable inflation; (iii) reducing
the vulnerability of the financial sector by strengthening banking supervision and deepening the
financial sector by enhancing access to credit; and (iv) diversifying the export base and improving the
business environment. Rwanda’s fifth PSI review was completed successfully in November 2012. The
macroeconomic framework presented in this document is consistent with the one used for the most
recent DSA and the fifth PSI review.
61.     Since 1970, IDA has committed a total of US$2.1 billion to Rwanda, of which 37% has
been in grants and 63% in credits. 24 Forty-five investment projects and 10 development policy
operations have been implemented to date. IDA’s current active portfolio comprises 8
projects/programs with a net commitment of US$312 million, of which approximately US$107 million
(33%) had been disbursed as of January 30, 2013.
62.     Rwanda has a high level of donor engagement, and the Government puts a high priority
on aid coordination and effectiveness. Rwanda uses aid effectively and therefore continues to attract
many development partners. There are currently 12 bilateral, 3 multilateral (the African Development
Bank, the European Commission, and the World Bank), and about 16 UN organizations active in
Rwanda. In addition, a large number of NGOs and vertical funds (including the Global Fund) are
funding major activities. A considerable amount of aid is still bypassing the budget. The Government
has been proactive in initiating better donor coordination and is supporting a number of donor
coordination forums.
63.     The Government, in collaboration with development partners, has set up a Development
Partners’ Performance Assessment Framework (DPAF) to review the performance of
development partners against a set of indicators of the quality and volume of aid. In the last
DPAF review for FY2011/12, the total aid came to US$938 million from 15 donors, with 29% of this
provided in budget support. The DPAF exercise is based on donor reporting data on their aid data and
programs providing information on the DPAF indicators, all of which is gathered in a development
assistance database. The results of the DPAF FY2011/12 demonstrate that there remains a
considerable challenge in the way aid is provided, particularly through the project modality. Efforts
are needed to ensure that project support, even if budget support is Government’s preferred aid
modality, is provided in line with the global commitments made in Paris, Accra and Busan. This
requires increased policy and procedure changes on part of development partners as well as the
Government.

64.     A strong track record of Bank collaboration with other development partners has
enabled it to further collaborate with them in preparation of this operation. The Bank has co-
Chaired and been lead donor for the PFM Sector Working Group and for the Capacity Building &
Employment Promotion Sector Working Group. These two groups coordinate all development
partners with government to report on EDPRS progress and feedback on sector progress to the
biannual Joint Budget Support Review. On the SCBI and the Bank’s support to the Public Sector
Capacity Building Secretariat, the Bank has worked closely with Belgium, the Netherlands, the Africa
Capacity Building Foundation, UNDP, the Department for International Development (DFID) and the
Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative. As lead donor on PFM, the Bank has provided quality
assurance on all activities for the multi-donor PFM Basket Fund supported by the DFID, Germany,
Sweden and the European Commission and collaborated closely with these partners to support the
Government’s PFM Reform Strategy 2008-2012. Several joint donor missions on PFM and Civil
Service Reform were carried out as part of the Public Sector Capacity Building Project
implementation. The Bank also co-Chaired Rwanda’s Joint Governance Assessment from 2007 until
the end of 2010 and collaborated closely with a wide set of development partners to review and
monitor Rwanda’s governance.

C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS
65.      This operation will strongly complement other Bank operation in Rwanda. Much of the
Bank portfolio relies heavily on decentralized delivery mechanisms. For example, the Land
Husbandry, Water Harvesting and Hillside Irrigation Project and the proposed new Feeder Roads
Project both have a strong focus on strengthening decentralized entities for delivery and will benefit
from the support under this proposed operation to strengthened decentralized governance and capacity.
This operation would have a close linkage to the 2013 Second Support to the Social Protection System
(SSPS-2) given that this operation supports the implementation of social protection programs in the
Districts while also seeking to build implementation capacity in relevant central institutions. It will
also strongly complement and draw on the Governance for Competitiveness Project (2012-15) which
has a component supporting the SCBI, skills development, and civil service reforms in specific public
institutions for export promotion in horticulture and tourism.
66.      All three PRSF series have supported service delivery 25. The first PRSF series (2004-07)
had a strong focus on service delivery, supporting the Government’s efforts to reduce poverty by
strengthening the macroeconomic stability to foster sustainable delivery of basic services in education,
health, energy and water sectors. The second PRSF series (2008-10) continued support to deepen basic
service delivery in these four sectors, while reducing the cost of service delivery and strengthening
public service capacity for effective decentralized service delivery. The second series added other
three sectors – agriculture, transport and financial sectors – and continued strengthening further the
linkages between strategic planning and the MTEF. In supporting fiscal decentralization, the second
series supported the adoption of budget software at District levels and the production of budget
execution reports (including an evaluation of Imihigo). Moreover, the Bank supported the assessment
of service delivery at the local level with Citizen Score Cards and Community Score cards and the
operationalization of a comprehensive 5-year capacity building strategy for local government. The
third PRSF series (2011) was expected to carry on support to a sustainable and efficient expansion of
basic services to the population with a greater participation of the private sector.
67.     The Community Living Standards Grant/Credit (CLSG/C) (2009-11) and SSPS series
(2012-onward) were also centered on decentralized service delivery in the health and social
protection sectors, and the Vision 2020 Umurenge (VUP) social protection program. Implementation
took place through the decentralized local government system. Furthermore, the VUP and community
health reforms were implemented through the same decentralized local government system. The
CLSG/C series supported policy reforms to enhance the VUP policy and operational design in line

     Annex 8 includes related policy areas, prior actions and outcome indicators in the past PRSG series.

with global good practices in these areas of intervention (social protection and health). The SSPS
series was designed to support the Government’s policy reform to consolidate, enhance efficiency and
effectiveness and expand coverage of the social protection system.
68.      The Decentralization and Community Development Program (DCDP 2004–2010)
supported the implementation of the Government’s decentralization (second phase) and
community development policies. The program focused on strengthening district capacity to lead
participatory planning with local communities and financing of priority community development
initiatives; developing a matching grants system to finance local government projects; and
strengthening decentralized project and financial management.
69.      The Public Sector Capacity Building Project (2005–2011) supported a broad set of public
sector reforms encompassing civil service reform (e.g. institutional restructuring, Integrated Personnel
and Payroll Information System, Citizen Charters), PFM (e.g. Integrated Financial Management
Information System, training, revenue management); and public sector capacity building interventions
including an Annual State of Capacity Building report. All of these reforms had a bearing on capacity
at the local government level.

D. LESSONS LEARNED

70.      The design of this operation builds on lessons learned from, for example, the successful
second PRSF series, which highlighted the importance of advancing Government-owned
reforms and emphasizing capacity building. Key success factors included the breadth of the Bank’s
policy dialogue with Government, and the recognition by policy-makers of the utility of budget
support in helping to move the reform process forward. Strong capacity support was a key factor in
the substantial progress achieved in PFM, health, education and agriculture sectors reforms.
Furthermore, because of the recognition of a lack of Government capacity in fiscal decentralization,
part of the supported reform program of the PRSF series focused on capacity building, including for
sub-national Government planning.
71.      DCDP also pointed out the importance of capacity building along with participatory
processes to promote demand side governance. DCDP introduced a comprehensive participatory
process through community planning and prioritization informed by national level guidelines. This
promoted both citizens participation but also the dissemination of demand side governance tools. An
example constitutes the citizens report cards introduced by the DCDP and which have been
institutionalized.

E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS 26

72.     The preparation of this operation was also motivated by various works that pinpointed
challenges associated with the decentralization process and the improvement of quality service
delivery. The 2010 PEFA noted that efficient and effective PFM and fiscal decentralization requires
not only adequate and transparent levels of resources for local authorities, but also financial
managerial capacity to mobilize their own revenues, manage resources efficiently and enhance
accountability for the way public money is spent.
73.     The Independent Evaluation of the Implementation of the PFM Reform Strategy 2008-
2012 also highlighted capacity constraints, including human resources, as one of the major
challenges in financial management – especially in the area of procurement– at the sub national
government level. This was stressed by the World Bank’s Enhancing Human Resource Management
for Rwanda’s Vision 2020, which considered the institutional capacity constraints affecting service
delivery at the district level. The 2011 Pay and Retention Policy Situational Analysis noted that staff

retention issues at district levels serve as a major hindrance to the decentralization process and good
quality of service delivery 27.
74.     The new 2013 Decentralization Policy was underpinned by several evaluations following
completion of the first and second decentralization phases. An evaluation report was
commissioned following each phase to assess achievements, challenges, opportunities and threats. In
addition, Districts capacity needs assessments were done during 2008/09 on the basis of which a 5-
year local government capacity building strategy was developed. In an effort to further inform
implementation of the new policy, the Government recently commissioned an assessment of sectoral
decentralization to generate lessons for implementation of the third phase and this has informed the
preparation of this operation as well.
75.      In 2008, Rwanda, together with the World Bank as co-Chair and its development
partners concluded a Joint Governance Assessment which was widely regarded as a good
example of a coordinated assessment. A further Joint Governance Assessment was published in
2011. The Bank completed an assessment of Rwanda’s progress on public service reform in 2012,
entitled, “Enhancing Human Resource Management for Rwanda’s Vision 2020?, which considered the
institutional capacity constraints affecting service delivery in the agriculture and energy sectors and
reviewed the literature on public service reform in Rwanda including the various Functional Reviews
carried out across the public sector between 2008 - 2011. The Bank has completed Implementation
Completion Reports for the Public Sector Capacity Building Project and the Decentralization and
Community Development Project and the lessons learnt have been absorbed into the design of this
proposed operation.
76.     The latest Rwanda Economic Update (REU) 28 of the Bank underpins the sections on
recent economic developments, macroeconomic outlook and poverty profiles and MDG
achievements. The half yearly REU series analyzes and synthesizes recent economic developments
and places them in a medium term and global economic context. The proposed operation has been
informed by the analyses of the REU. Each edition of the REU contains a special feature on a selected
topic. The latest REU covers “Poverty Reduction in Rwanda – Past, Present, and Implications for the
Future?.

                                  V.      THE PROPOSED OPERATION

A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

77.      This operation amounts to SDR 33.4 million (US$50 million equivalent) grant financing
to the Government. It supports the implementation of Rwanda’s long term national development
Vision 2020 and EDPRS II. The design of this operation has benefited from a close collaboration with
the Government, development partners, Civil Society Organizations, and various stakeholders and is
in full alignment with the CAS and the Africa Regional Strategy, with its foundation on governance
and public sector capacity.
78.      The PDO is to support the Government to clarify institutional roles and responsibilities
for decentralized service delivery and to enhance public transparency, fiduciary accountability,
and local government capacity for improved access to quality services. The PDO is in full
alignment with the draft EDPRS II’s overarching priority theme on strengthening accountable
governance through promoting greater citizen participation in government and enhancing the quality
of decentralized public service delivery.
79.      Prior actions. The prior actions have all been completed (Table 7 and Annex 1). Hitherto, the
PRSF series has drawn the prior actions from the Government’s Common Performance Assessment

Framework (CPAF) agreed between the Government and development partners to monitor budget
support so as to align behind the joint monitoring and evaluation framework. Given that the aid
shortfall has adversely affected the policy dialogue between the Government and development
partners in the area of budget support, and the stand alone nature of this operation, this program has
adopted more flexibility in selecting prior actions from the Government reform program, including
from outside the CPAF.

                      Prior Actions                                          Source of Actions
Policy Area 1: Strengthened Policy Framework for Decentralization
The Recipient has approved a new decentralization Cabinet approved the new policy in January 2013

central and local government
The Recipient has published in the Official Gazette the Gazetted in July 2012, Presidential Order No. 25/01 of
Presidential Order establishing the list of fees and 09/07/2012
other charges levied by decentralized entities and the
applicable thresholds

Policy Area 3: Improving Government Accountability and Transparency to Citizens
The Recipient has published in the Official Gazette a Access to Information Law was Gazetted in March
new Access to Information Law which provides for the 2013
public’s right to information
Policy Area 4: Enhanced Local Government Fiduciary Accountability
The Recipient has reviewed twenty five (25) District     By December 2012, twenty five (i.e. 83%) District
Audit Committee reports of 2012 and issued               Audit Committees had held quarterly meetings and
communication to the districts on the main areas for     reported to their respective District Councils
follow up

80.      This operation also helps mitigate the short term economic and social impacts of the aid
shortfall as well as prevent a spillover effect to poverty reduction and MDGs in the
medium/long-term. The Government has so far protected priority expenditures in social programs
including transfers to districts. However, in the short-term, in the absence of additional aid, the
Government would be forced to reduce not only capital but also current expenditures. This will
inevitably have not only a negative impact on service delivery and poverty reduction in the short-term,
but also holding back progress made in the past decade in the medium to long-term. In order to deal
with a sustained reduction of aid, in the medium to long term the Government plans to mobilize
alternative domestic and external financing sources, including a possible larger recourse to private
participation in the infrastructure and social sectors.

B. POLICY AREAS

POLICY AREA 1: STRENGTHENED POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR DECENTRALIZATION

Description
81.      This operation supports the Government’s efforts to strengthen its policy framework for
decentralization, including by clarifying institutional roles and responsibilities. In the past
decade, the Government has introduced comprehensive decentralization implementation plans to put
its policy and each phase of decentralization into practice, as well as a Fiscal Decentralization Strategy
in 2011 led by MINECOFIN to guide the implementation of the Fiscal and Financial Decentralization
policy. The institutional framework has also been developed with the establishment of a
Decentralization Sector Working Group to coordinate cross-government and external policy dialogue.

                                                     20
The Government has also reconfigured institutional arrangements by establishing a Rwanda
Governance Board and Decentralization Focal Points in Ministries and Provinces.
Challenge
82.      The Government recognizes that although local government entities now have more financial
and human resources at their disposal, there are four key challenges to ensure that they perform
effectively and to consolidate the still evolving and phased decentralization process moving forward.
83.      First, although as previously mentioned there have been positive developments in
participation and accountability, participatory local governance and effective citizen-centered
service delivery need to be improved. The Citizens Report Card exercise (2010) has revealed that
citizens’ participation was particularly weak in areas such as participation in the district budgetary
process (35%). The current institutional mechanisms such as the JADF need to be strengthened
including through the broader use of ICT and community radio, sensitization of citizens on their rights
to participate, and a legal framework for access to information. A shift towards greater downward
accountability between local public officials and citizens is required given that currently the Imihigo
performance contracting system tends towards stronger upward accountability between local officials
and the executive.
84.      Second, inadequate functional linkages between local governments and line Ministries
remain. Progress on sector decentralization varies across sectors. The Government recognizes the
need to improve the clarity of roles and responsibilities between the center and sub national entities
while deepening the overall devolution of power. There are concerns that line ministries continue to
influence staffing at the district level through deploying and earmarking staff salaries which can create
distortionary pay and work differentials that undermine performance.
85.     Third, a legal framework clarifying the roles and responsibilities of sub national entities
is required, in accordance with the new decentralization policy. The existing legal framework has
evolved progressively but remained weak.             The Constitution provides clear principles for
decentralization. However, its implementation is complex and subject to different interpretations by
stakeholders. Recent situational analysis for the new policy suggested the need to clarify the functions
assigned to the Provinces and to overcome incidences when political officials step into the technical
sphere by clarifying respective political and technical roles in local government.
86.      In the same vein, fourth, the legal framework for sub-national revenue needs to be
tightened. Local governments have, since 2002, been assigned responsibility for collecting property
taxes, trading licenses and rental income taxes. Local authorities also collect fees, including fees for
plot sales, public cleaning services, market fees and notary charges. However, there are issues with the
legal and policy framework to promote local service delivery and economic activity. In particular, the
framework for local fees and other charges allows decentralized entities to charge a relatively wide
range of rates, against a wide range of different fees and charges – some of which have a high
‘nuisance’ value – without a proportionate link to the public service being provided. A legal
instrument defining a ‘closed list’ of allowable fees and other charges, with clear maximum allowable
rates associated with each one, would help to address this issue.
Government actions to date and future activities to address the challenge
87.     The new Decentralization Policy aims to align national policy with the key challenges
identified by the situational analysis. It sets a policy direction on: (i) enhancing citizen participation
and systems of accountability such as the JADF and ICT enabled reporting which is discussed in
Policy Area 3; (ii) strengthening intergovernmental coordination and the clarity of roles and
responsibilities; and (iii) improving overall capacity development at the local government level and
reviewing local government structures and incentives to enable Districts and their lower levels to hire
appropriate staff, which is discussed in Policy Area 2; and (iv) local economic development. The
policy also sets a strategic policy direction on (v) enhancing fiscal decentralization including
strengthening systems of PFM and accountability which is discussed in Policy Area 4.
                                                   21
88.      To achieve the key objectives, the Government commits to undertake strategic actions in
14 areas such as local government structures with clear roles, responsibilities and functions 29
and espouses some fundamental guiding principles. These are ‘subsidiarity’ (whereby the central
government shall only perform those tasks which cannot be undertaken at the local government level
while local governments shall apply the same principle to the lowest level); national unity and
indivisibility and equitable development; as well as the separation of powers between technical and
political authority. Other guiding principles concern respecting local autonomy and diversity,
championing a one size does not fill all approach and gender equality and social inclusion.
89.     The Government is already taking some significant steps forward in the development of
the legal framework. A new Law Governing Decentralized Administrative Entities has been drafted
and is currently in the Senate for approval. It will consolidate and simplify all laws on
decentralization. It establishes the procedures guiding the appointment or election of different local
leaders, their roles and responsibilities, and the roles and responsibilities of provinces.
Complementary measures to strengthen the legal framework for local revenue raising have been
enacted as part of the new policy framework.
90.      In addition, the Government plans to issue Prime Ministerial Instructions on Sectoral
Decentralization during 2013. These will both formalize existing sectoral decentralization
arrangements, which are currently not clearly defined, and accelerate the decentralization of
responsibilities in various sectors to sub national entities in a sequenced manner over time. The
instructions follow a government study on sector decentralization that has provided an inventory of all
decentralized activities to the districts with recommendations for additional activities to be
decentralized in 2013/14 and in the medium term, for example in the areas of health, education,
infrastructure and agriculture. With the issuance of the instructions, roles and responsibilities of local
governments will be greatly clarified.
91.     The Government will also issue revised local government organizational structures that
match the increasing decentralization of responsibilities to the District and sub-district resulting
from the new Decentralization Policy. The new structures will be determined through the current
review of effectiveness and efficiency of the entire public sector that the Government is completing in
June 2013. The current restructuring proposals for the Districts will, for example, enhance public
financial management staff capacity by increasing the Finance Unit from 5 to 11 staff and adding an
additional internal auditor. The staff of the Planning, M&E Unit is proposed to double from 3 to 6
staff.

92.      The legal framework for subnational revenues has also been strengthened considerably.
A law establishing the Sources of Revenue and Property of Decentralized Entities and Governing their
Management was passed at the end of 2011, and was further implemented by a Ministerial Order
determining the modalities for the implementation of the law 30. Together these legal instruments will
make the local revenue system less regressive in many respects. For example, the former trading
license tax did not take into account ability to pay, with small local traders paying the same amount as
large companies: the new law now takes into account ability to pay (VAT registered companies will be
classified by turnover). The administrative provisions also created high compliance costs for
taxpayers. The simplified administrative arrangements under the new law will also reduce taxpayer
compliance costs.
93.     To implement the new Decentralization Policy, the Decentralization Sector Working
group has developed a new National Decentralization Sector Strategic Plan 2013/14–2017/18.
This plan sets out a more in-depth five year strategic framework to guide the decentralization policy
implementation, with clear output areas and activities under each policy theme that will be measured
through time bound outcome indicators and targets. The plan has been approved through the system
of developing sector strategies for the EDPRS II and will be monitored jointly by government officials
and development partners and the Decentralization Sector Working Group. The strategy elaborates
the implementation and coordination arrangements for the decentralization policy both within
government and with development partners.

94.      The first prior action is ‘the Recipient has approved a new Decentralization Policy which
clarifies the roles and responsibilities of central and local government’. This will ensure that the
Government approach is relevant, comprehensive and up-to-date for the decade ahead and has a
stronger focus on enhancing good governance, local level autonomy and evolving demands for local
government responsiveness to citizenry needs. The policy also sets the agenda for concrete follow up
on legal reforms and executive instructions for implementing the new policy and reforms.
Expected results
95.       The new Decentralization Policy will be implemented through the Law Governing
Decentralized Administrative Entities and the Prime Ministerial Instructions that will clarify
roles and responsibilities of districts and sub-districts. This will help increase the effectiveness and
efficiency of local governments by eliminating duplication of efforts. The clarification of roles and
responsibilities will be reflected in revised local government organizational structures, that will
facilitate the allocation of human and financial resources to national and sub-national government
entities, in a way that is more commensurate to their functions and responsibilities. The structures will
be approved following the completion of the national review of public sector efficiency in June 2013.
The progress in filling staff positions in these revised local government structures will be measured.
The Government’s targets on the percentage of staff positions filled in revised organizational
structures is 70% in 2013/14 and 90% in 2017/18.
Prior Action 2
96.     The second prior action is ‘the Recipient has published in the Official Gazette the
Presidential Order establishing the list of fees and other charges levied by decentralized entities
and the applicable thresholds’. The Presidential Order 31 established a ‘closed list’ of fees and other
charges – thereby limiting the scope for ‘nuisance’ fees and charges and setting clear maximum
allowable rates to ensure that the fees and other charges levied are consistent with the quality of
services provided, are not distortionary in nature and do not discourage utilization of services, thereby
creating a better enabling environment for local economic development.
Expected results
97.      The improved regulation of the collections of fees and other charges by decentralized
entities will facilitate increased access to the corresponding services to citizens. The increase
usage of the services will be measured through the amount of fees and charges collected by districts
(whose rates are capped by the Order). The preliminary result in 2012 32 shows that total fees and
charges collected by the districts significantly increased over 2011 33. The Government’s targets are
12% increase from the baseline in 2013/14 and 47% increase in 2017/18.

POLICY AREA 2: CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT FOR QUALITY SERVICE DELIVERY BY
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
Description
98.     This policy area supports the government’s efforts to enhance the capacity of local
government to provide quality services to the population. Since decentralization began, the
Government has taken strong efforts to strengthen the capacities of the sub national entities
particularly through trainings for staff and new PFM systems such as the IFMIS and the Integrated

31
   No. 25/01 of 09/07/2012
32
   Including half year data after the implementation of the Presidential Order.
33
   In addition to the Presidential Order, an introduction of ‘a zero cash policy’ in late 2012 – fees and charges are
paid through a bank account rather than cash – and a land registration policy in 2011 may have contributed to the
increase.
                                                        24
Personnel and Payroll Information System to improve pay, establish controls and increase staff
motivation. Rwanda has made strong progress given the low skills base that existed following the
genocide.
Challenge
99.      Nonetheless, several local capacity challenges remain. First, there are challenges to recruit,
attract and retain staff in local governments. There is a national skills gap that makes it particularly
challenging for Districts to hire and then hold onto good caliber professional and technical staff 34. The
gaps affect priority sectors for service delivery such as agriculture 35. Second, under-staffing at the
sub-district, cell and village levels undermines their technical strength. The Government is keen to
deepen sub-districts’ role in service provision if the technical capacity is in place. Evidence also
suggests that many local government professional staff such as District agronomists are overloaded
due to the limited staff at the sub-district and district level. These gaps affect service delivery and are
likely to challenge long term quality and access enhancements. In addition, relatively little attention
has been given to strengthening organizational and institutional systems such as organizational
structures and human resource management. Capacity strengthening interventions at the subnational
level have also been uncoordinated and overly focused on training.
100.     Sub national PFM systems need to be strengthened concurrently with human and
organizational capacity. This is especially pronounced among subsidiary entities below districts
(which number 4,348 in total), including frontline service delivery units such as schools and health
clinics. In particular, there has been inadequate attention to District level reporting, as highlighted in a
recent IMF report. 36 Reporting by subsidiary entities (also known as non-budget agencies) is described
as “negligible? for transfers to hospitals, health centers, primary and secondary schools. Given that
transfers to these agencies are likely to increase in the future, the reporting system urgently needs to be
strengthened to provide adequate capacity for subnational fiduciary accountability.
Government Action
101.    Since 2012, all Districts have embarked on a new process to elaborate five year District
Capacity Building Plans. This is a result of the 2010 government’s Local Government Capacity
Building Strategy and the 2012 Implementation Plan for this strategy supported by the Bank’s PRSF-
7. The central government has assisted the Districts with quality assurance and guidance to enhance
impact, and supported Districts with less capacity. Cross-cutting priority areas have emerged from the
new Plans, particularly PFM, planning, human resource management and M&E. In addition, there is
the need for enhanced knowledge management; organizational structures that match growing sub
national responsibilities; and leadership and governance.
102.     The District Capacity Building Plans have been an important input to the current
Government led review of public sector efficiency and effectiveness which will make
recommendations for enhancing human resources at the sub national level through revised local
government organizational structures. For example, under current proposals, whereas previously
thematic areas such as infrastructure and agriculture were staffed by one or two individuals in the
District, under the new proposals small units of several staff (5 staff on average) will be established in
the areas of infrastructure, local economic development, agriculture, governance, health, education and
social development. Along with the above mentioned proposed District staffing increases in public
financial management and planning, these new institutional arrangements should significantly boost
local government capacity for service delivery. The Plans have also fed into a new study on Local

34
   The National Skills Audit in 2009 identified a 60% skills gap in the country and a serious shortage of human
capital in the public sector with gaps concentrated in the professional cadre.
35
   the 2009 national skills audit showed the agriculture sector accounting for 35% of the total skills shortage in
the country

Government Common Capacity Building Priorities which summarizes cross-cutting needs to be
addressed in the medium term.
103.     Progress is being made in developing PFM systems capacity below the District level. The
Government produced a Concept Note setting out plans to improve financial reporting of subsidiary
entities in three phases: (i) achieve accountability of subsidiary entities through submission of
financial reports; (ii) set up a database of all subsidiary entities and conduct a capacity needs
assessment; (iii) elaborate uniform reporting requirements and embed the financial reporting
requirement in the legal framework. The new PFM Reform Sector Strategic Plan includes an indicator
to monitor the roll-out of a simplified accounting and financial reporting application to Districts. This
system is currently being developed for Kigali District but is not yet well advanced. The scheduled
targets are to achieve the following coverage of the 2,054 subsidiary units: 2013/2014 (6% or 123
units); and 2014/2015 (47% or 965 units). It will strengthen fiduciary accountability below District
level in the short-to-medium term while more comprehensive systemic reforms are developed.
Prior Action
104.     The prior action is ‘the Recipient has adopted twenty eight (28) District capacity
building plans approved by the District Councils’. To date, 29 out of 30 Districts have finalized
their plans and the remaining plan is expected to be finalized and validated by the respective District
Council by the end of April 2013 37. These plans are a significant departure for the capacity building
efforts because they are (i) bottom up, owned by the Districts and based on a holistic diagnostic tool,
and move Rwanda on from the previously top down and often uncoordinated interventions of the past
decade; (ii) being coordinated with the District Development Plans (DDPs) that form part of the
EDPRS II. They also provide an assessment of the cross cutting and more systemic issues affecting
local government which provides a stronger basis than hitherto for concerted and strategic follow up
by the government on local level institutional and organizational development needs.
105.    Effective implementation of the plans is ensured by the MINECOFIN budget call
circular requiring Districts to attach one year versions of the five year plans to their budget
submission for 2012/13. This establishes a clear linkage between the plans and the budget process.
Given the cross-cutting nature of the local government capacity needs, the follow up to the plans will
involve both the national center of government level, for example through the above mentioned
reforms to overall public sector organizational structures that will result from the current public
service review, and the local level through specific District activities. Central level funding for the
plans through the national Capacity Building Fund will be prioritized. The Government has recently
commissioned work to assess the potential for a pooled funding mechanism to develop a more
coordinated long term funding mechanism for local government capacity strengthening.
106.    Linking the plans to the DDPs will also facilitate implementation. The DDPs have been
developed to ensure that Districts play a key role in implementing the EDPRS II. By ensuring a
synergy between national and district planning processes during the past year, the government has
sought to ensure that capacity development issues are mainstreamed into all District five year plans
and the overall EDPRS II delivery.
Expected results
107.     The prior action is expected to lead to improved administrative capacity for the delivery
of quality service by local government, particularly in the four top priority areas of human
resource management, planning, M&E and PFM. Following the elaboration of their locally
tailored capacity building plans, the specific activities to strengthen organizational, institutional and
individual capacities will be monitored. The operation will track improvements in PFM through an
indicator measuring increased information on resources received by service delivery units. The
simplified accounting and financial reporting application for Districts’ subsidiary entities – i.e. units

37
     The Government exceeded the prior action by adopting 29 rather than 28 District capacity building plans.
                                                         26
below District level, including service delivery units such as schools and health centers – will build on
a model currently being piloted in Kigali. Its roll-out will be essential in ensuring that decentralized
PFM systems are able to track funding down to service frontline delivery units, ultimately with a view
to a revised IFMIS being used for this purpose. The improved fiduciary accountability at the central
and local levels will support accountable governance and improved service delivery quality. Over the
medium-term, if fully implemented, this will enable the Government to have a routine accounting
system for resources received by subsidiary entities including schools and health clinics, resulting in a
“B? score on PEFA indicator PI-23 which measures the availability of information received by service
delivery units. During the program period, an improvement from the baseline of “D? (as reflected in
the 2010 PEFA assessment) to “C? in 2013/14 is expected as a result of the recent conduct of a public
expenditure tracking survey in the education sector. 38 The rating is expected to be further improved to
B in 2017/18.

POLICY AREA 3: IMPROVING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY AND
TRANSPARENCY TO CITIZENS
Description
108.     This policy area supports the Government’s efforts to improve accountability and
transparency to citizens as fundamental elements of sustained performance and results in public
service delivery. As the Bank’s Africa Strategy observes, an intimate relationship exists between
weak governance and low public sector capacity in Africa with many countries caught in a low-level
equilibrium trap of both. Poor delivery of services is ultimately a result of weak systems of
accountability and inadequate checks and balances. The policy area will help deliver the EDPRS II
thematic pillar on accountable governance.
Challenges
109.    Civil society lacks the capacity and experience to demand accountability from service
providers. Participatory decision making processes and feedback loops remain underdeveloped.
There is a historically rooted power of the Rwanda state relative to Rwandan society dating back to the
pre-colonial era. Since 2000, the number of CSOs has grown rapidly with close to 90% in the form of
Community Based Organizations. Some of these organizations such as Transparency International
Rwanda are involved in monitoring service delivery and the budget process. A Rwanda Civil Society
Platform provides a coordination and dialogue forum. However, as the CAS notes: “these
organizations largely confine themselves to philanthropic work and small income generating activities.
Progress is needed on two fronts: (i) to strengthen the environment for CSO engagement with the state
including access to information on government policies and programs; and (ii) to strengthen the
capacity of CSOs to engage in policy formulation processes?. The capacity of local communities and
civil society organizations to articulate their concerns is low and mechanisms to transmit their
demands to different levels of government are also nascent. Deepening downward and vertical
accountability between the state and citizens remains a significant challenge.
Government Action
110.    The Government has been developing various mechanisms to enhance civil society
participation in its decentralized service delivery structures since 2000. For example, the
Government has established the JADF in all the Districts as one of the primary mechanisms for
participatory dialogue with civil society. It also convenes participatory dialogue on District
development priorities through holding District Public Accountability Days and an annual National
38
  Scoring a “C? on PI-23 requires, under the PEFA framework, that special surveys undertaken within the last 3
years have demonstrated the level of resources received in cash and in kind by either primary schools or primary
health clinics covering a significant part of the country OR by primary service delivery units at local community
level in several other sectors. The report “Rwanda Public Expenditure Tracking Survey in Education,? was
published by Transparency International Rwanda in March 2012.
                                                       27
Dialogue involving the citizenry on national development priorities. 39 The monthly Umuganda
community work public meetings also provide opportunities for citizens to discuss local priorities in
their localities, and there are community training programs on citizen rights and responsibilities that
involve campaigns using the radio and television.
111.     The strength of these participatory mechanisms on service delivery performance will be
strongly determined by the degree to which citizens have access to public information and are
empowered to use that information to demand results and influence policy. The Government has been
taking steps forward in this area. First, on budget transparency, Rwanda has scored poorly on the
Open Budget Index in recent years because various key budget documents such as the pre-budget
statement and in-year reports were not publicly available. However, in 2011/12 the Government
posted several key documents on its website including the approved budget, the citizens’ guide, the
budget call circulars and the revised budget and budget framework paper. In 2012/13, the Government
has taken further steps and published in year reports and the annual budget execution report on the
MINECOFIN website. Second, the Office of the Government Spokesperson is leading work to
enhance the quality of the 179 public websites (including district websites) through a new ranking
system that measures quality enhancement including the speed by which websites are updated; the use
of Kinyarwanda to enhance accessibility to all citizens; and effectiveness in publications and
archiving. It has carried out training for all District communication officers in 2013 to enhance
website quality, media relations, and use of social media. Third, the government has prioritized the
publication of service delivery charters on the doors of Districts, sub-districts and cell offices spelling
out the procedures for citizen complaints and the service that citizens should expect to receive.
Prior Action
112.     The prior action is 'the Recipient has published in the Official Gazette a new Access to
Information Law which provides for the public’s right to information’. The law has strong
potential to improve the enabling environment for increasing transparency and public accountability
since it provides for the right to information possessed by public organs and some private bodies by all
citizens. It will help to deepen the existing participatory mechanisms. The new law requires disclosing
information where the public interest in disclosure outweighs the interest of not disclosing such
information. There is a clause on the proactive disclosure of vital information to the public. Particular
emphasis is put on the following: (i) to promote the culture of informing the public about their
activities; (ii) to ensure that the expenditure of public funds is subject to effective management and
oversight; (iii) to promote founded public debate; (iv) to ensure that any public authority with a
regulatory mission properly discharges its functions. To facilitate information disclosure, the new law
requires appointing information officers to provide information to any citizens requiring it. The new
law applies equally to local government institutions as to the central level administration and will be
rolled out to both simultaneously. 40 The Office of the Ombudsman will play a key role in monitoring
the enforcement of the law.
113.    The impact of the new Access to Information law will be determined by the voice and
empowerment of citizens to demand and use information. The Rwanda Governance Board is
proposing to sensitize the public (and public institutions) to it in partnership with the Human
Rights Commission. The law is part of a media reforms package gazetted in March 2013 that
includes a law to regulate the media and a law to determine the responsibilities, organization and
functioning of the Media High Council. These two laws fundamentally alter the nature of media
regulation providing for the print media to be self-regulated and the broadcast media to be regulated
by the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency. In order for a more independent media to use access to
information legislation more meaningfully, a further law to establish a Rwanda Broadcasting Agency

39
  This issue is noted in the draft Decentralization Sector Plan 2013-17.
40
  A set of Ministerial Orders will be issued as a result of the law, for example clarifying the information that
could destabilize national security and determining in detail the information that shall be proactively disclosed to
the public by public and relevant private organs.
                                                        28
and replace the Rwanda Bureau of Information and Broadcasting with a more independent body that
aims to become fully self-reliant in the long term has been adopted by the Senate and should soon be
gazetted. These are important steps towards strengthening the demand side of public accountability,
by increasing the ability of the media to hold the state accountable and convey public information to
wider society.
114.     In addition to the legal environment for access to information, the Government has
taken complementary steps to better manage information so that it is easily accessible to the
public as well as within government. In September 2012 the Cabinet agreed new procedures for an
Electronic Document Tracking System for the government. This will improve the way that the
Districts respond to the public by better storing records and tracking officials' performance in
responding to public letters and requests. The system will support enhanced intergovernmental
coordination since local governments will have easier access to Central Government documents and
vice versa; information flows will be improved and documents will be quicker to locate. The system is
being rolled out to all Districts and Ministries at the same time. Second, the Rwanda Governance
Board is developing a new local government monitoring system to collect service delivery data at the
District level which will be available online once functioning in 2013/14, thereby enhancing
transparency of comparative district data to the public.
115.    Expected results
The prior action is expected to enhance the government’s accountability to citizens, including at the
local level to improve the quality of service delivery. The outcome indicators measure improvements
in the degree of citizen participation in the district budgetary process and in formulation of the Imihigo
activities, based on the annual Citizen Score Card which was supported in the 2nd PRSF series as a
means of increasing citizen voice in service delivery. On citizen participation in the district budgetary
process, the Government aims to improve from 11% in 2010 to 20% in 2013/14 and 50% in 2017/18;
of which, the participation by women is expected to increase from 10% in 2010 to 19% in 2013/14 and
50% in 2017/18. On citizen participation in formulation of the Imihigo, the Government aims to
improve from 24% in 2010 to 30% in 2013/14 and 55% in 2017/18; of which, the participation by
women is expected to increase from 22% in 2010 to 28% in 2013/14 and 55% in 2017/18.


POLICY AREA 4: ENHANCED LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIDUCIARY ACCOUNTABILITY
Description
116.    Greater local government autonomy requires improved fiduciary accountability through
the sub national PFM system at and below the District level covering subsidiary entities
including schools and health centers. Increased sub-national capacity and accountability will support
improvements in service delivery quality by allowing local services to be more responsive to local
needs, ensuring more efficient and effective use of public resources.
Challenge
117.     Fiduciary accountability systems at the local government level require significant
attention. Weak internal controls in financial management and reporting are identified by the 2010
PEFA. Although financial management capacity has improved in the Districts, according to the
Auditor General’s Report for Districts of 2011, none of 30 Districts received a clean audit and in the
reports scrutinized, many complaints were raised by the Auditor General involving not less than Rwf
70 million. The report also expressed serious concerns over persistent failure to implement prior year
audit recommendations 41.

                                                     29
Government actions to date and future activities to address the challenge
118.     To improve transparency and accountability at District level, Audit Committees were
established in all 30 Districts in June 2011. 42 Audit Committees are responsible for: (i) providing
advisory assistance to the management of the government entity for the betterment of its operational
efficiency; (ii) considering and reviewing the financial statements of the government entity focusing
on their overall credibility, unbudgeted expenditure and any other unusual transactions; (iii)
considering and approving the annual action plan of the internal audit unit; (iv) considering and
reviewing of internal audit and Auditor General’s reports and recommend appropriate actions to be
taken in connection with the issues raised and recommendations in those reports; (v) follow-up with
management to ensure the implementation of the agreed recommendations within the agreed time
frame. In local government entities, members of the Audit Committee are appointed by District
Councils, and the members in turn elect a chairperson among themselves. Since the internal audit
function reports to management, the Audit Committee structure provides a mechanism for ensuring
that timely action is taken on audit reports and 'protects' the independence and objectivity of internal
auditors. Therefore, the establishment of District Audit Committees is expected to result in
improvements in internal audit and financial accountability within local governments.
119.     Audit Committees in Districts are required to report on a quarterly basis to their
respective district councils. The Audit Committees discuss implementation of both external and
internal audit recommendations. They are also supposed to review financial statements and advise
management. Since the Audit Committees are still a relatively recent initiative, improved effectiveness
of follow-up on audit recommendations will require further training and sensitization. This will
include: training of Audit Committee chairmen and secretaries; training on ‘finance for non-finance
managers’ to committee members without a financial management background; awareness sessions
for other government actors; Audit Committee marketing materials (e.g. brochures); and, review of
Audit Committee regulations in line with lessons learnt. Meanwhile, monitoring of audit
recommendations started in 2012 by the Government Internal Auditor Office and the Office is
consolidating the monitoring reports from all government entities for submission to the Prime
Minister’s Office with a copy to the Office of Auditor General.
Prior Action
120.    The prior action is ‘the Recipient has reviewed twenty five (25) District Audit Committee
reports of 2012 and issued communication to the Districts on the main areas for follow up’. This
demonstrates that the internal and external audit function is becoming established at District level,
with the majority of District Audit Committees submitting reports to their respective District Councils.
Follow-up on implementation of audit queries (e.g. weak accounting and financial reporting systems)
would contribute to ensuring that public funds are used for the purposes intended in an efficient and
effective manner and contribute positively to improved service delivery and local governments’
fiduciary accountability.
Expected results
121.     Improvements in fiduciary accountability at local government level, including in internal
audit, are expected. These will result from the implementation of the new PFM Reform Strategy,
including the increased effectiveness of the new District Audit Committees. The main result expected
with regard to the embedding of District Audit Committees is that they should start to complete
follow-ups regarding their reports on internal and external audit issues with the management in the
District executive. In turn, this is expected to be reflected in an increase in the number of Districts
with proper books of account maintained and with financial statements that provide a ‘true and fair

42
   Based on ministerial circular N°004/09/10/MIN of 01/10/2009, and supported by Audit committee regulations
in 2010 and an Audit Committee Charter in July 2011.


                                                    30
view’ based on the audit opinion of the Auditor General. Overall these reforms should help to embed a
culture of fiduciary accountability in the Districts, thereby promoting more efficient and effective use
of public resources. This prior action will be measured by the number of districts with qualified audit.
The Government aims to increase the number of districts with qualified audit to 5 districts in 2013/14
and 15 districts in 2017/18. With the increase in the number of districts with qualified audit, 5 districts
are expected to have clean audit in 2017/18 43.

                               VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

122.    The analysis of poverty and social implications found that this operation has no
significant impacts on distribution (Annex 2). Improved service delivery at decentralized levels is
expected to benefit all segments of the population. As poor households are more dependent on public
services which currently lack quality (for instance public education), the proposed operation can be
expected to benefit the poor more than the wealthier households.
123.     The policy area to support the Government in a strengthened policy framework for
decentralization is expected to have a positive impact on poverty reduction. Through an
improved clarity on roles and responsibilities between the central and local governments, service
delivery at the local government level is expected to improve. The prior action relating to the
implementation of the Presidential Order on fees and other charges is likely to have a pro-poor impact
as it limits the number of fees and charges levied by local government by introducing a ‘closed list’
system and establishes maximum allowable limits on the associated rates, ensuring they are more
proportionate to the services rendered.
124.    The policy area on capacity development for quality service delivery is expected to have
a positive impact on all segments of the population. Improved capacity of institutions and local civil
servants will result in higher quality services, which will positively impact all users of those services.
The evidence from the decentralization process over the last decade has shown capacity building
interventions were too supply driven and uncoordinated. By supporting capacity building plans that
are based on local needs, this operation will help ensure that those interventions are better targeted and
thus have larger benefits for the local population.
125.    The policy area on improving government transparency and accountability to citizens is
key to improve service delivery. Through the increased availability of quality public information and
an improved access to the information, beneficiaries will be better placed to proactively approach the
Government (both central and local) and make their demands for improved services heard.
126.     The policy area to enhance local government fiduciary accountability is expected to have
an indirect positive impact on poverty reduction over the medium- to long-term. The policy
action, by improving local government compliance with PFM laws and procedures, would ultimately
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public funds, thereby ensuring decentralized entities
provide better services for a given budget. Given that the volume of funding spent through Districts is
likely to increase over time this effect should also become more important in the medium- to long-
term.




43
   A qualified audit means that ‘except for the matters raised, proper books of account have been maintained and
the financial statements do give a true and fair view of the state’ based on audit opinion of the Auditor General.
A clean audit means that ‘proper books of account have been kept and the financial statements give a true and
fair view (clean audit)’ based on audit opinion of the Auditor General. The former is a prerequisite for the latter.

127.    The policies supported by this operation are not expected to have any adverse effects on
the environment. Country systems are functioning and appropriate arrangements have been made
through the Bank’s work, to address any such effects that might arise.
128.     Furthermore, Rwanda has improved its institutional environmental management
framework. In 2006, the Government established the Rwanda Environment Management Authority
(REMA) to enforce environmental standards and audit functions. In 2009, REMA published a Rwanda
State of Environment Outlook Report 44 to support the Government’s commitment under the EDPRS to
finding a balanced approach between environmental conservation and the need for increased
agriculture productivity. 45 Additionally, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is within the
Environment Compliance Unit in the Rwanda Development Board (RDB). 46 Additionally, the United
Nations Environment Program supports small grants to build capacity in key ministries to carry out
environmental assessments. Moreover, the Global Environment Facility projects are also supporting
institutional capacity development on environmental management in Rwanda, particularly on
ecosystem and watershed management in both the central and district levels.
129.     In addition, an extensive Environmental Assessment and Social Analysis was undertaken
during PRSG-1 and remains relevant; as well as other environmental management assessments
undertaken in the context of other Bank projects to address potential environmental concerns. This
includes policy discussions to: (a) strengthen the Government’s capacity in the key environmental
management agencies; (b) address the lack of adequate staffing with relevant skills training both at the
central and district level; and (c) strengthen environmental monitoring and analysis.

C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

130.     The monitoring and evaluation arrangements rely on Government arrangements with
the aim of strengthening Government capacity and institutions. The Government has developed in
close collaboration with development partners, including the Bank, a results and performance
framework integrated into the planning and budgeting processes for monitoring the EDPRS. The
integrated result framework/monitoring system consists of three components: (i) a National Results
and Policy Matrix, (ii) the CPAF which forms a subset of support PAF and (iii) the DPAF. This
operation will particularly utilize indicators in the CPAF, the PFM Sector Strategic Plan 2013–18, and
the Decentralization Sector Strategic Plan 2013–18 for monitoring and evaluating progress on
governance, public sector reform and decentralization. These indicators are monitored through
Rwanda’s Sector Working Group structure whereby the government and its development partners
meet regularly and in quarterly Joint Sector Reviews to report on sector progress. It will also draw on
the annual government Citizen Score Card and Governance Score Card exercises which report on
citizen satisfaction with service delivery and overall quality of service delivery. In 2014, Rwanda will
carry out a further PEFA following the 2010 PEFA assessment which will provide relevant data on the
policy area concerning increased budget transparency and accountability.
131.   The government has also designed appropriate institutional settings to monitor its
reform program implementation, in which responsibility for the overall monitoring of the EDPRS

   Various pilot activities are being undertaken to test different approaches by the REMA and MINAGRI,
including through the Bank and Global Environment Facility (GEF)-supported Integrated Management of
Critical Ecosystems Project (recently closed) and Lake Victoria Environmental Management Project-II (being
initiated). A new GEF project, supporting Rwanda’s forest and landscape restoration initiative, is proposed to
address the forestry and agriculture nexus, in addition to biodiversity, land degradation, and climate change
issues.

    RDB is the one-stop center for business registration, incorporating the EIA clearance process, and has helped
to minimize clearance procedures for businesses.

rests with MINECOFIN’s National Development Planning & Research Directorate. The National
Budget Directorate reports on spending of the budget and related outputs. This unit also ensures that
the sector spending plans are incorporated into the macro-MTEF, and budget.
132.     To improve monitoring systems, the Bank has supported the Government’s efforts to
build quality and institutional capacity. The Bank is implementing a grant from the Belgian Poverty
Reduction Partnership Trust Fund aimed at enhancing statistical capacity particularly in the area of
poverty analytics. It is also providing support to the National Institute of Statistics through the
Statistics for Results Facility. Finally, the Bank’s ongoing investment projects each have a M&E
component that helps to strengthen capacity in this area in the public sector.

D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

133.    Implementation of the first PFM Reform Strategy has had positive results. The basic
PFM principles were introduced in all central level institutions, a comprehensive, coordinated and
integrated framework for PFM was established and is currently operational and the culture of the PFM
has been strengthened in all the institutions. 47 The November 2012 independent evaluation report on
the implementation of the first PFM Reform Strategy noted the need to expand the scope of the PFM
Reform Secretariat beyond the activities funded by the PFM basket fund.
134.    Rwanda performs very well on comprehensiveness of information in budget
documentation. The current annual budget was presented to the parliament and approved in June
2012 and was also published on the web-page 48 of the MINECOFIN in July 2012. The details of all
large value contract awards above Rwf 300 million are published on the Rwanda Public Procurement
Authority website on a quarterly basis (PEFA 2010 report). All central government audit reports of the
Office of Auditor General are made available to the public 49. However, more still needs to be done to
ensure that audit recommendations are implemented as required by the legal framework. 50
135.     The areas of PFM performance that are not showing much improvement and remain
weak include: (i) multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting; (ii)
availability of information on resources received by service delivery units; (iii) quality and timeliness
of in-year budget reports; (iv) legislative scrutiny of the annual budget law; (v) proportion of aid that
is managed by use of national procedures. The areas of PFM performance that are showing some
improvement but still remain weak include variance in composition of expenditure out-turns compared
to original approved budget and lack of follow-up on audit queries.
136.    The November 2012 independent evaluation report noted that inclusion of most central
and local government employees in the IPPIS is a significant step forward from the previous
manual system. 51 Some progress has also been achieved in the implementation of IFMIS, which has
been rolled out to over 100 sites. However, the current IFMIS lack some key modules and
functionalities. The Government plans in the next 5 years to have a full-fledged IFMIS operational
across all budgeting entities. Following the successful establishment of the foundations for the PFM
framework, the second phase of the PFM reform strategy will focus on consolidation of the reforms
and deepening their application to the Local Governments and the periphery.

    A PFM Reform Steering Committee, comprising representatives of the implementing agencies and
development partners, oversees the implementation of the PFMRS.

   However, apparent failure to respond openly to a critical technical report casts considerable doubt over the
IPPIS future upgrading and development. The report recommended that a systems audit program should be
prepared to enable to test the accuracy of data entry and the efficiency of the software in producing the right pay
and deduction calculations.

137.    The most recent safeguards assessment of the BNR was completed by the IMF in the
context of the PRGF arrangement approved on June 12, 2006. The updated assessment was
completed on January 26, 2007, and it made several recommendations to address continuing
vulnerabilities in the external audit and financial reporting areas. The implementation of these
measures is being monitored under the Fund program, but there has been no separate follow-up since
2007. The Central Bank has been regularly audited, and its audited financial statements are publicly
disclosed accompanied by internal control reports..52 The audit opinion issued is unqualified (clean)
and in compliance with international financial reporting standards.

E. DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

138.    Amount, Beneficiary, Terms, and Tranching: The Recipient is the Republic of Rwanda,
represented by MINECOFIN. A single-tranche development policy grant consisting of a Grant of SDR
33.4 million (US$50 million equivalent) will be made available following approval and notification by
IDA of financing effectiveness.
139.     Disbursements: The proposed Grant will follow the Bank’s disbursement procedures for
development policy operations. The Grant proceeds will be disbursed against satisfactory
implementation of the development policy program and the maintenance of a satisfactory
macroeconomic framework. The Recipient shall open, prior to furnishing to the Association the first
request for withdrawal from the Financing Account, and thereafter maintain the following two deposit
accounts (“Deposit Accounts?) at the BNR on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association:
(a) a deposit account in United States Dollars (“Foreign Currency Deposit Account?); and (b) a
deposit account in Rwandan Franc (“Local Currency Deposit Account?). Upon notification by IDA of
Grant effectiveness, and with the submission by the Recipient of a withdrawal application, the
proceeds of the Grant will be deposited into an account designated by the Recipient that forms a part
of the country’s foreign exchange reserves at the BNR. Upon each deposit of an amount of the
Financing into the Foreign Currency Deposit Account, the Recipient shall ensure deposit by the BNR
of the local currency equivalent amount into the Local Currency Deposit Account. The Recipient shall
promptly, upon each withdrawal from the Financing Account, provide to the Association a report in
form and substance satisfactory to the Association on the amounts deposited in the Foreign Currency
Deposit Account and on the amounts deposited into the Local Currency Deposit Account with an
indication of the exchange rate applied. Disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases and no
procurement requirements will be necessary. However, the proceeds of the Grant cannot be used for
ineligible expenditures (i.e. to finance goods and services from the IDA’s standard negative list as
reflected in the Financing Agreement). If the Association determines at any time that an amount of the
Financing was used to make a payment for an Excluded Expenditure, the Recipient shall, promptly
upon notice from the Association, refund an amount equal to the amount of such payment to the
Association. Amounts refunded to the Association upon such request shall be cancelled.
140.     Reporting, Accounting, and Auditing: The Recipient will report to IDA on the amounts
deposited in the Foreign Currency Account and credited in local currency to the budget management
system with an indication of the exchange rate applied. The Director of Treasury will be notified
accordingly. The BNR will not impose any charges or commissions on Government for these
transactions. The conversion from US dollar to Rwanda Franc will be based on the prevailing
exchange rate on the date that the funds are credited to the consolidated account. Government, through
the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, will: (i) provide written confirmation within 30 days
to the Bank that an amount equivalent to the Grant proceeds from the Bank has been credited to the
consolidated account, with an indication of the exchange rate applied; (ii) provide evidence that the

   Audits of the Central Bank are annual and published in the annual reports, which can be found under
publications at http://www.bnr.rw. The most recent audit report is part of the annual report for June 2012 , which
will be uploaded on the BNR website. Audit reports are accompanied by internal control reports (not included in
the published report). The exercise dates back to audits of 1997, conducted in 2002.
                                                       34
Rwanda Franc equivalent of the Grant proceeds was recorded as financing for Government budget;
and (iii) ensure that the Rwanda Franc equivalent of the Grant proceeds are subject to controls to
ensure its use for eligible budgeted public expenditures only. The Financing Agreement gives IDA the
right to require the Recipient to audit the Foreign Currency Deposit Account and Local Currency
Deposit Account through agreed terms of reference.
141.    Closing Date: The expected closing date of the Financing will be June 30, 2014.

F. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

142.    There are a number of risks that could jeopardize the expected outcome of the proposed
operation. These include (i) political risks, (ii) macroeconomic risks, (iii) stakeholder risks, and (iv)
program specific risks. The design of the proposed program should help mitigate some of these risks.
143.     Political risks. The political situation surrounding Rwanda is fluid. Following the publication
of a UN report alleging Government involvement in the DRC, the international community has reacted
by suspending or delaying planned budget support to Rwanda. Over recent months, the international
community has welcomed the peace talks that remain ongoing in Kampala (between the Government
of DRC and one rebel group active in the east of the country) and Rwanda’s signature of the regional
peace framework agreements that was initiated by the UN Secretary General. If the political situation
worsens again, it will be further translated into macroeconomic risks, stakeholder risks and program
specific risks.
Mitigation: The World Bank is formulating ‘A strategy to support economic development and promote
peace and stability in the Great Lakes region’ which proposes specific projects and is expected to have
a positive impact on easing the regional tension. Though this operation does not have a direct impact
on regional security and stability, it tackles frontally some of the concerns that development partners
have expressed in the domestic domain. With its focus on transparency, participation and
decentralization, the operation engages with a number of issues regarding the openness of
Government, both at the center of Government and at the frontline of service delivery. For example, it
supports a new law on Access to Information that provides citizens with the right to public information
as the basis for stronger voice and engagement with government on policy and service delivery issues.
The law also requires more proactive disclosure of information by the government to improve
transparency. The proposed operation also supports a stronger policy framework on decentralization
that will enhance social accountability at the local government level through improved systems for
participatory dialogue and community feedback.
144.    Macroeconomic risks. If the suspension/delay in foreign assistance inflows continues, core
economic indicators (e.g. inflation, exchange rates, international reserves, and the budget) are likely to
deteriorate in the short-term. The short-term impact will in turn be holding back progress made in
poverty reduction, social indicators, and MDGs in the medium to long-term.
Mitigation: The financing provided through the proposed operation will help the Government maintain
public expenditures in priority areas for poverty reduction and service delivery, as well as ease
pressures on interest rates, exchange rates, and international reserves in the short-term. Therefore, this
operation is expected to reduce a systemic risk to poverty reduction, MDGs and social indicators in the
medium and long-term.
145.     Stakeholder risks. The Government has exercised ownership of its reform program, and
development partners have aligned development cooperation with government strategies through
effective policy dialogues under the BSHG. However, the suspension/delay in aid have negatively
affected the policy dialogue between the Government and its development partners. This will
undermine a good track record of aid effectiveness and aid coordination. The Government and
development partners are discussing a draft concept note regarding mechanisms for dialogue which
could lead to a revitalization of the Development Partners Consultative Group. This mechanism would
allow for a number of development partners that were previously excluded from the BSHG to
                                                   35
participate in the policy dialogue process. Nevertheless, a longer term cessation of general budget
support by the international community going into the next financial year is likely to change the
content of the dialogue over time.
Mitigation: The proposed operation was prepared in consultation with the Government and other
development partners. This process has enabled the Bank to remain engaged in policy reform
dialogue with the Government. Upon the finalization of the EDPRS II in mid-2013, the Bank will
start preparing the next CAS covering next 3-5 years in FY2014. The CAS preparation and
consultation will also mitigate stakeholder risks. With discussions regarding the formal structures for
development partner-Government coordination still underway, it is not possible at the moment to
describe the exact mechanisms that might prevail over the medium term.
146.    Program specific risks. The policy reform supported by this operation as well as their
respective expected outcomes will be affected by the abovementioned risks. Most notably, the
improvement of quality service delivery will depend on the availability of adequate budget resources.
Program-specific risks include the country’s weak capacity, especially for implementing interventions
in a decentralized environment and producing quality and timely outcome indicators. Decentralization
begun in 2000 and local government systems and skills, as well as M&E systems, are still developing.
Mitigation: By complementing other Bank operations such as SSPS-2, this operation will mitigate
these risks by supporting reforms that will contribute to further building government capacity, while
also improving transparency and accountability. For example, it will support the approval of District
Capacity Building Plans for at least 90% of Districts, a stronger policy framework for decentralization
that will boost the government’s strategic support to enhanced intergovernmental coordination and
local level capacity; and strengthen district’s public financial management capacity through supporting
the internal audit function. In addition, Bank’s support through other operations such as the Statistics
for Results project (P124129) aims to improve the quality and timeliness of statistical information, as
well as making it accessible to users. Additional support for enhancing public sector capacity and
moving forward civil service reforms is being provided through the Governance for Competitiveness
Project (P127105).

A NNEX 6: INTERGOVERNMENTAL FISCAL RELATIONS
Revenue responsibilities of local governments are limited. Since 2002, local governments – the 30
Districts together with Kigali City – have been responsible for collecting limited taxes and fees. 56
There is thus a heavy vertical fiscal imbalance: in the 2012/13 revised budget, central government
revenues total 24.4% of GDP while local government revenues are merely 1.3% of GDP. In addition,
51% of local revenues are collected by Kigali City and its three Districts, with the share of own
revenues in District budgets outside Kigali at around 14%. In other words, districts heavily rely on
financial transfers from the central government to finance their budgets.
Three main channels of inter-governmental transfer are: (i) block transfers 57; (ii) earmarked
transfers; and (iii) development transfers (including the Common Development Fund or CDF). Block
transfers are discretionary and fund the administrative functions of local governments to supplement
service delivery, although in practice they are largely used for salaries. Earmarked transfers finance
the majority of service delivery at the local level. Development transfers are budgeted under the
projects and programs of the relevant sector line ministries. Donor funded external grants also finance
inter-governmental transfers by supplementing the three transfer channels, either merging with
Government funds in the form of general or sectoral budget support, or in the form of financing of
specific projects through development transfers (e.g. the CDF). There are also off-budget external
grants channeled directly to Districts which cannot be quantified, as well as funds spent in Districts
that are managed directly by line ministries.
Earmarked transfers account for the majority of inter-governmental funding flows. They
account for around 70% of total transfers in the revised 2012/13 budget: the remainder is almost
equally divided between block transfers, development transfers and external grants (Annex Table 1).
Further, the share of earmarked transfers in total budget votes varies across line ministries, indicating
that sector ministries have decentralized to varying degrees (Annex Table 2).

   Local governments collect three taxes: property tax, trading licenses and rental income tax. The local
government revenue legal framework was revised in 2011 with the passage of a law establishing the sources of
revenue and property of decentralized entities (Law no 59/2011), and implemented in 2012 by a Ministerial
Order determining the modalities for the implementation of the law and a Presidential Order which regulates the
range, level and rates of fees and other charges levied by local governments.

Block Transfers
Horizontal allocations of block transfers across districts are formula based. Block transfers are
reviewed annually, with the total amount determined as a percentage of the previous year’s central
government domestic revenues, ranging between 3–5% 58. In 2010/11, the Government introduced a
new formula for horizontal allocation based on (i) population (20% weight); (ii) poverty (30%
weight); and, (iii) number of sub-districts (50% weight). Although the size of own revenues is not part
of the allocation formula, it is taken into account by excluding Kigali City and its three Districts from
receiving block transfers on account of their large own revenues. MINECOFIN plans to review the
formula to incorporate a fiscal capacity component in the near future. 59
Earmarked Transfers
The size and composition of earmarked transfers are determined by relevant line ministries
through the budget process. Since 2010/11, guidance on earmarked sector transfers has been collated
in annual District Earmarked Transfers Guidelines. 60 The guidance includes specified formulae for
each earmarked sectoral transfer, together with the allocation by program to each district and Kigali
city together with expected outputs for each program and sub-program.
The majority of earmarked transfers are equally allocated across districts (i.e. divided by 30),
while the largest service delivery transfers under major line ministries have more complex
allocation formulae. 61 Many sector ministries also provide more than one earmarked transfer: for
example in 2012/13 MINEDUC budgeted for 13 different earmarked transfers, covering areas such as
teacher salaries and girls’ education. Indeed, the number of earmarked transfers has proliferated since
their introduction in the 2006 budget. In the revised 2012/13 budget, local authorities received
transfers against up to 28 programs and 51 sub-programs in addition to block and development
transfers. As a result, districts have limited flexibility to allocate funds based on local priorities.
Development Transfers
Development transfers, partly financed by external grants, are budgeted under projects and
programs of the relevant line ministries. Thus, districts do not have the flexibility to select their
own projects and programs, except through the CDF 62. The CDF is a discretionary cross sectoral
investment transfer under MINALOC. It was introduced in 2002 with the intention of providing
support to districts for development purposes. The transfers aim to allocate an amount equivalent to at
least 10% of the previous year’s domestic revenue (although in practice the allocations have been
much lower), as well as external grants. For CDF, 90% of the Government funds and all donor funds
are allocated according to a formula with three components: (i) District population (40% weight); (ii)
land area (20%); and, (iii) poverty headcount (40%). The remaining 10% of the Government funds in
2012/13 were allocated based on the results of 2010/11 Imihigo performance rankings.
Aggregate Resource Allocation
The aggregate effect of the inter-governmental transfer system is that per capita budget
allocations vary considerably across districts. Table 3 presents data on aggregate local government
resources from the revised 2012/13 budget. There is a Rwf 30,000 per capita difference between
Nyarugenge (Rwf 52,000 in transfers and own revenues per capita and a poverty rate of 10%) and
Gicumbi Rwf (19,000 per capita, poverty rate of 49%).

   The percentage is not grounded in a specific legal instrument, but does reflect a cabinet level decision.

   This review awaits the findings of a “Local Government Revenue Potential Study? currently being undertaken
by Georgia State University.

Planning, September 2012 (pp. 197).

   Equal shares means dividing the total aggregate transfer amount equally among the recipient local authorities.
62
   This is envisaged under the Fiscal Decentralization Strategy: MINECOFIN’s ultimate objective is to establish
a single discretionary development transfer for each local government.

A NNEX 10: R WANDA ’ S 2007 A ND 2010 PEFA
This annex presents a summary of the PEFA 2010 prepared in the second half of 2010, covering a
Central Government (CG) assessment and a Sub-National (SN) assessment. The CG Assessment is a
repeat assessment as a PEFA for CG has been undertaken in 2007. It will inform the direction of
future PFM reforms. It showed remarkable improvements compared to the 2007 PEFA
Overall, the PEFA assessment for found a marked improvement in external audit (PI-26) and
legislative scrutiny of audit reports (PI-28). Weak PFM performance remains concentrated in three
areas, first in regard to the multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting
(PI-12) and composition of expenditure out-turn compared to original approved budget (PI-2), second
in regard to quality and timeliness of reporting of in-year budget reports (PI-24) and annual financial
statements (PI-25); and, finally, in regard to effectiveness of internal audit (PI-21
When comparing the 2007 and 2010 ratings it should be noted the previous PEFA may have under-
scored or over-scored some of the ratings for indicators or individual dimensions. Thus a simple
comparison of the overall scores between two assessments at different times, not detailed by
dimension, and with no analysis of change, can suggest deterioration, improvement or stagnation of
indicators, which is in fact not the case. In the case of Rwanda there was real progress despite the
appearance of stagnation, if an indicator was over-scored by the previous assessment, as the PEFA
team found to be the case for PI-11. Similarly, in the case of PI-21 and PI-25 there is the appearance of
deterioration as indicators or dimensions were highly over-scored in the PEFA 2007. Also, there was
progress for PI-18 but less so than indicated by a simple comparison of the overall scores, as the
indicator was over-scored by the previous assessment.
The CG assessment found that the areas of PFM performance that were already at a very satisfactory
level of performance (A) in 2006 and have remained such are: PI-3 Aggregate revenue out-turn
compared to original approved budget (A); PI-5 Classification of the budget (A); PI-13 Transparency
of taxpayer obligations and liabilities (A).
The areas of PFM performance that have improved and achieved a very satisfactory (A) or acceptable
(B) level of performance are: PI-1 Aggregate expenditure out-turn compared to original approved
budget (A); PI-4 Stock and monitoring of expenditure payment arrears (B); PI-6 Comprehensiveness
of information included in budget documentation (A); PI-8 Transparency of inter-governmental fiscal
relations (A); PI-10 Public access to key fiscal information (A); PI-11 Orderliness and participation in
the annual budget process (B+); PI-14 Effectiveness of measures for taxpayer registration and tax
assessment (A); PI-16 Predictability in the availability of funds for commitment of expenditures (B+);
PI-17 Recording and management of cash balances, debt and guarantees (B); PI-18 Effectiveness of
payroll controls (B+); PI-19 Competition, value for money and controls in procurement (A); PI-20
Effectiveness of internal controls for non-salary expenditure (B+); PI-22 Timeliness and regularity of
accounts reconciliation (B); PI-26 Scope, nature and follow-up of external audit (B+); PI-28
Legislative scrutiny of external audit reports (B); D-1 Predictability of Direct Budget Support (A).
The areas of PFM performance that are showing some improvement, yet remain weak, are: PI-2
Composition of expenditure out-turn compared to original approved budget (D); PI-7 Extent of
unreported government operations (D+); PI-9 Oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from other public
sector entities (C); PI-21 Effectiveness of internal audit (C); PI-25 Quality and timeliness of annual
financial statements (D+); D-2 Financial information provided by donors for budgeting and reporting
on project and program aid (D+).
The areas of PFM performance that are not showing much improvement and remain weak are: PI-12
Multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting (C+); PI-15 Effectiveness
in collection of tax payments (D+); PI-23 Availability of information on resources received by service
delivery units (D); PI-24 Quality and timeliness of in-year budget reports (D+); PI-27 Legislative
scrutiny of the annual budget law (C+); D-3 Proportion of aid that is managed by use of national
procedures (D).

                                                   53
Ratings that have remained unchanged since the 2007 PEFA, and are difficult to justify are: PI-7 (ii),
PI-23, and D-3 at D; PI-15 and PI-24 at D+; PI-12 and PI-27 at C+. For PI-7 (ii), more information on
donor assistance than what is included in fiscal reports is available within MINECOFIN, for PI-15,
effectiveness in collection of tax payments, unchanged at D+ since the 2007 PEFA, despite Domestic
Revenue Generation being a component of the Government PFMRS under Pillar 1, Economic
Management and Budget; for PI-24, as in-year budget reporting did take place in 2007 and 2008; and
in-year reporting just ceased.
Regarding the others, it can be noted that: D-3, proportion of aid that is managed by use of national
procedures, shows that donors are not sufficiently relying on country systems for the channeling of
donor assistance, and have not increased their reliance since 2006, despite the constant and
coordinated presence of donor support in Rwanda, an overall improvement in PFM processes, and the
general objective under the Paris Deceleration and the Accra Agenda to increasingly rely on national
systems; The failure of improvements in the availability of information on resources received by
service delivery units (PI-23) is surprising especially give the fiscal decentralization process
underway, and the stated objectives of the National Decentralization Policy. Regarding legislative
scrutiny of the annual budget law (PI-27), the indicator rating cannot improve as long as the current
situation, of no limit in place for the size of supplementary budgets, reflected under dimension (iv),
continues. The failure of the MTEF (see PI-12) to deliver its true objective of linking policy targets
with actual budget allocations and thus ensure at the same time a strategic allocation of resources and
fiscal sustainability, is also costly in Rwanda, given the vast amount of capacity invested in the multi-
year planning process, which is very extensive and involves a large variety of activities throughout the
budget preparation cycle, across all sectors. Regarding the implementation of IFMIS/SmartGov, which
is part of the official PFM Government Reform Program, under Pillar 2, component 3, it has fallen
behind schedule. Its delay is at the root of the fact that the quality of financial statements (PI-25 (i))
has not improved as much as its potential, as it is hampered by the continued coexistence of two
different systems, SagePastel and SmartGov. Overall, not enough effect has trickled to PFM systems
in the area of accounting, recording and reporting despite it being one of the main reform pillars.

The PEFA 2010 SN Assessment found a satisfactory nature and scope of the external scrutiny of SN
governments (see SN PI-26, rated at A for nature and scope and B overall). The OAG in fact audits all
SN governments on a yearly basis and issues the results of the audit as part of the Annual Report presented
to Parliament, under Volume III. Also in parallel with CG, and also probably as a result of an acceptable
level of external oversight, including on the implementation of audit recommendations, the SN Assessment
found that controls on both salary and non-salary expenditure are at an acceptable/satisfactory level, with
PI-18 and PI-20 both rated at B+. At the SN level, the core dimension transparency and comprehensiveness
was assessed only on the basis of two indicators (PI-8 and PI-10), one of which was found not applicable
(PI-8). On the basis of PI-10 only, which assesses public access to key fiscal information, transparency at
the SN level is satisfactory (A). The core dimension accounting and reporting, assessed at the SN level on
the basis of the availability of funds for commitment expenditures (PI-22) and in-year budget reporting (PI-
24), shows acceptable to good results (B+), and a more positive status of processes than for CG.
By indicator, the SN Assessment found that the areas that are at a good or acceptable level of
performance are: PI-2 Composition of expenditure out-turn compared to original approved budget
(B,B,A,B); HLG-1 Predictability of transfers from higher levels of Government (B+, B+, B+, A), PI-10
Public access to key fiscal information (A); PI-16 Predictability in the availability of funds for commitment
of expenditures (B+); PI-18 Effectiveness of payroll controls (B+); PI-20 Effectiveness of internal controls
for non-salary expenditure (B+); PI-22 Timeliness and regularity of accounts reconciliation (B+); PI-24
Quality and timeliness of in-year budget reports (B+); PI-26 Scope, nature and follow-up of external audit
(B+).
The following areas were found to be weak: PI-1 Aggregate expenditure out-turn compared to original
approved budget (D,B,D,D); PI-11 Orderliness and participation in the annual budget process (D+).

IMF Executive Board Completes Fifth Review under the Policy Support Instrument for Rwanda
Press Release No.12/463
November 28, 2012

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the fifth review
under a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Rwanda. In completing the review, the Board
approved a waiver of nonobservance of the quantitative assessment criterion on net domestic financing
(NDF).

The Executive Board approved a three-year PSI for Rwanda on June 16, 2010 (see Press Release No.
10/247). The IMF's framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries that may not need, or
want, IMF financial assistance, but still seek IMF advice, monitoring and endorsement of their
policies. PSIs are voluntary and demand driven (see Public Information Notice No. 05/145.)

Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Rwanda, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:

“The Rwandan authorities are to be commended for their satisfactory implementation of the economic
program supported by the Policy Support Instrument, carried out against a challenging global
economic environment. Economic growth has continued to be strong, inflation remains contained, and
poverty has further declined.

“Fiscal and monetary policies remain appropriate. Delays in budget support have required postponing
some government spending, and fiscal policy during the remainder of the fiscal year will need to be
carefully executed to minimize recourse to domestic bank financing and avoid crowding out the
private sector. Meanwhile, the central bank has appropriately tightened the monetary stance to slow
credit growth and mitigate exchange rate and inflation pressures.

“Strengthening the domestic revenue base and public financial management are important objectives,
including for reducing aid dependency. The recommendations of a recent technical assistance mission
on tax policy and revenue administration represent a good basis for broadening significantly the tax
base.

“The government has taken important steps to strengthen Rwanda’s debt management capacity. It will
be critical in the period ahead to continue with prudent management of debt and complete large
ongoing investment projects. It will also be important to maintain the momentum of structural reforms
to improve the business environment, strengthen competitiveness, and broaden the economic base, in
order to sustain economic growth and further reduce poverty,? Mr. Shinohara added.

    Development C hallenge
    I.     Rwanda has restored peace and national security, and achieved remarkable development
    success since the devastating Genoc ide in 1994. The growth rate in the past decade exceeded eight
    percent per annum and the poverty rate improved from 59% in 200 I to 45% in 20 II.
2.      While Rwanda has made significant development progress in the past decade, the country
remains one of the poorest in the world with 45% of the population below the poverty line and 24%
               1
extremely poor • In 2010, the under 5-mortality rate (MDG target 4) stood at 76 per 1,000 much
higher than the 2015 target of 47. Improving the delivery of basic services to the poor, including
health, education and water among others, is fundamental for Rwanda to address its large
development challenges. Furthermore, improving service delivery- and making it more responsive
and accountable to citizens' needs through decentralization - is a key priority of Rwanda ' s
Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction strategy.
3.      Many of Rwanda's social achievements are currently at risk as a resu lt of a shortfall in
donor budget support equivalent to approximately 3% of GOP in FY20 12/13. We have thus far
protected our social programs by decelerating capital expenditures and increasing domestic
borrowing. Going for.vard, however, in order to adjust to a sustained reduction in aid, we will in
the short-term be forced to make additional budget cuts, with inevitable negative impacts on
growth, service delivery, and ultimately poverty reduction. Therefore, and considering that a very
large share of our population remains highly vulnerable, one of the main motivations for seeking
financing from the World Bank for the proposed program is that of avoiding a reversal in the
significant social progress we have made in the past decade.


    P rogress in Se1-vice Delivery
4.      Decentralization has been pursued by the Government of Rwanda since 2000, and
accelerated since 2006, as one important means of promoting national unity, good governance,
better and more accountable service delivery, and national development. Sub-national district and
sub-district governments have become responsible for planning, coordinating - working through
sub-district entities - and implementing the provision of a large and increasing number of basic
services, ranging from health and education, to water, sanitation, and agricultural development
Between 2002 and 2005, total transfers to districts increased from 1.4% to 4% of total domestic
revenues; they increased to 25% in 2006 and reached 33% in 2012. In 2012, transfers from the
central government to districts were comprised of (i) block grants (14%); (ii) transfers from the
common development fund (CDF) (6%); and (iii) earmarked funds (80%). In addition, districts
have their own revenues ranging from 5 to 20% of their budgets.
5.      The early steps of the Government's decentralization program have coincided with rapid
improvements in access to public services in Rwanda, especially in rural areas, where 98% of the
poor live. For example, the use of public primary education by poor rural households increased
from 68% in 2006 to 75% in 20 11, while access to health centers increased from 63% in 2006 to
81% in 20 II. However, progress has been uneven across sectors and there are still large challenges
to reach the poorest citizens and enhance overall quality, for example in the area of education. For
example, while almost 70% of Rwandans have access to health insurance, coverage is only 53% for
households among the poorest 20%.
6.      Despite these dramatic improvements in access to public services, much remains to be done,
both in improving the quality of service delivery and, relatedly, its responsiveness to local priorities
and local feedback. This can only be achieved by a deepening of the decentralization process in
Rwanda, which will help to improve service delivery through a number of channels. First, although
the number of services whose provision has been decentral ized has grown rapidly during recent

years, there is now an urgent need to formally and clearly specify the different roles of ditTercnt
levels of government in the provision of basic services. This will help avoid duplication of efforts
across government levels, and will ensure that citizens have greater clarity regarding which level of
government is respons ib le, and hence accountable, for which service. It wi ll also facili tate the
allocation of human and fi nancial resources to national and sub-national government entities, in a
way that is commensu rate to their functions and respons ibili ties. To this end, we have recently
adopted a new decentralization policy on the basis of which we are passing new legislation and
executive orders that wi ll clarify the responsibilities of various levels of government in the
provision of basic services.
7.     The Government of Rwanda is also convinced that as sub-national governments become
increasingly capable, and they successfully promote local economic development in their
communities, their resource mobilization ability will also increase. Enhanced resource mobilization
at the local level will bring new opportunities for regional development, helping finance
investments and the provision of services that reflect specific local needs. However, while it is
important that local governments have flexibility in their resource mobilization efforts, it is also
paramount to define clearly the specific jurisdictions of national and sub-national governments in
terms of taxation powers. Moreover, it is important to ensure that tax rates and the fees charged by
local governments are consistent with the value of the services they are capable of offering. Both
excessive fees that do not reflect the quality of the services being provided, and the proliferation of
multiple ' nui sance' fees, could negatively affect access to those services and indirectly affect local
economic development. With these motivations, we have passed new legislation, and a new
Presidential Order has been issued to regulate the range of taxes and fees -as well as their rates -
whose collection is the attribution of sub-national governments.
8.      ln addition, the allocation of additional responsibilities and resources to sub-national entities
has to be accompanied (and in many cases preceded) by efforts to build their capacity, especially in
the cross-cutting areas of public financial management, human resources management, planning
and monitoring and evaluation. The availability of well-trained human resources and the
dissemination of modern management systems and result frameworks will be essential to ensure
that the increasing resources transferred to sub-national governments are translated into improved
services de livered to the population. Furthermore, given that resources are extremely scarce in a
country of the level of income of Rwanda, it is paramo unt that capacity building activities, funded
by the national government or development partners, are well coordinated and prioritized, taking
into consideration the varying needs of entities in different regions of the country and different
levels of government.
9.      Finally. we firmly believe that strong accountability mechanisms will be fundamental to
ensuring that sub-national governments perform their functions in an efficient and effective and
responsive way. This involves enhancing government transparency and accountability to citizens,
but also improving fiduciary accountability. The overall objective is to ensure that public resources
are not only focused on their intended purposes, and generate the expected results, but also that
these results are reflective of local priorities and subject to local accountability. To that end, since
the beginning of the decentralization process, the Government of Rwanda has placed a strong
emphasis o n creating mechanisms for the population to not only elect local government officials,
but also to be able to monitor and provide feedback on local government activities. To further
enhance that process, we have recently taken two important policy measures. First, we have passed
a new Access to Information Law, which we expect will help to enhance public transparency and
the accountability of the state (at all levels of Government) to the citizenry. Indeed, the Law
provides for the right to access infom1ation possessed by public organs and some private bodies
where the public interest in disclosure outweighs privacy considerations. Second, we have taken
steps to ensure that at least 80% of the Audit Committees elected by District Councils that we
established in al1 30 districts in 201 I, are fu nctioning properly - i.e., having met on a quarterly basis
and submitted audit re ports to their respective Councils. We believe this is an important measure to
strengthen the audit function in subnational governments, as it helps ensure that audit
recommendations are actually implemented by District governments.

Requ est for World Ba nk Su pport
 I0.    In the context of Rwanda's strong track record of macroeconomic management and poverty
reduction, including through the improvement of service delivery at the sub-national level, the
Government has requested World Bank support to consolidate its social achievements and further
enhance the policy framework for increasing the effectiveness, efficiency, and responsiveness of
local governments. We have requested the World Bank to support the Government in improving
the quality of service delivery at the decentralized level by focusing on (i) a strengthened policy
framework for decentralization; (ii) capacity development for local government; (iii) improved
government accountability and transparency to citizens; and (iv) enhanced fiduciary accountability.
We have identified these policy areas based on our decentralization experience and evaluations in
the past decade.
 II.     We have made progress in decentralization and public sector reforms, which were supported
by previous and ongoing Bank operations including the past Poverty Reduction Support Facility
series. Recently, we have adopted the following policy and institutional actions: (i) Adoption of a
new decentralization policy that clarifies institutional roles and responsibilities; (ii) Issuance of a
Presidential Order establishing the list of fees and other charges levied by decentralized entities and
the applicable thresholds; (iii) Finalization of District Capacity Building Plans in in at least 28
Districts; (iv) Publication in the official Gazette of a new Access to Information Law that provides
for the right to public information by citizens; and (v) Submission of audit reports for 2012 by at
least 25 District Audit Committees to their respective District Councils. These policy and
institutional actions are critical for making progress in the above mentioned policy areas. For
example, District Capacity Building Plans are a significant departure from the top down and often-
uncoordinated interventions in the past decade, to bottom-up interventions that are owned by the
Districts and based on a holistic diagnostic tool.
 12.    Outcome indicators have been identified to measure the progress supported by the operation.
Baseline and target values for each year have been established, against which actual values will be
measured in the second half of 2014. These indicators will be monitored through Government's
own arrangements such as the Common Performance Assessment Framework (CPAF). We expect
that the use of Government's own monitoring framework will strengthen it.
 13.    The Government is strongly committed to financing decentralized public services but is
currently dealing with the possibility of having to cut a significant amount of earmarked transfers
from the central government to Districts, as a result of the above-mentioned sudden reduction in
foreign aid. ln the current fiscal year, in particular, we have experienced a 60% reduction in planned
budget support. As a result, the current account deficit has widened from 7.3% in 20 II to I 0.4% in
2012. This has led to 30% decline in international reserves. While the aid shortfall has amounted to
 II% of the original budget, we have so far been ab le to execute 90% of budgeted expenditures
through an increased recourse to domestic borrowing. However, if the current aid shortfall were to
be sustained, we would be forced to further cut expenditures, including capital expenditures and
certain earmarked transfers from the central government to districts which in our revised
FY2012/13 budget we have made contingent on the receipt of additional aid flows. Those
contingent expend itures include Rwf 35.2 billion (US$55.6 million) out of Rwf 110.3 billion
(US$ 173.8 million) that had been originally budgeted main ly in the areas of agricu ltural
development, access to energy, water and sanitation, primary and lower level secondary education,
health services and human resource capacity for district and sub-district governments (A nnex 1).
We would like to note that the financing from this operation (US$50 million) will allow for the
execution of 90% of these human and social development programs through earmarked transfers
from the central government to districts during the current fiscal year, in line with the objective of
the operation. Earmarked transfers from the central government to districts account for two thirds
of districts' revenues and are central to improving service delivery at the local government level.
14.                                                                                             _ _ _ _ __
       In compliance with our Ia and practices, we will report on the financial execution of our.
budget through audit (March 31, 20 14) and budget execution reports (September 30, 2013), as well




                                                    61
as on the results generated through those transfers through An nual Performance Reports
(September 30, 20 13), and share the information with the World Bank and othe r Development
Partners.
15.    The Government of Rwanda stands ready to execute the expe nditure items by the end o f
FY2012/ 13. More precisely, we have already prepared contracts for the expenditure items. Upon
the availability of financ ing from this operation, we will execute the expenditure items. We w ill
periodically update the World Bank on progress.


Conclusion
In closing, the Government of Rwanda expresses its gratitude to the World Bank for its continued
support to the development of Rwanda and reiterates its strong commitment to reduce poverty and
foster sustainable growth. T he Government would greatly appreciate the approval o f the proposed
financing to assist in the implementation of its policy reform program.
