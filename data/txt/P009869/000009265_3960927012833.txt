HEMORANDUM AND RECONNENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE KIECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LCAN
To nDZi
F    TH1uE NATHPA JHAIRI PO    PROJET
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
India for US$485 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed
loan will be at the standard IBRD variable interest rate, and be repayable
over 20 years, including a five-year grace period. The proposed loan will
help finance the Nathpa Jhakri Power Project.
2.       Background.  With severe shortages of power remaining a serious
constraint to economic growth, India must continue to invest in new generating
capacity while in parallel increasing the efficiency of existing power
systems. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in
expanding India's power supply, in improving the utilization of existing
assets, and though more mooestly, in increasing resource mobilization. An
importalkt institutional gain has been the emergence of NTPC as the foremost
entity in India for installing new generating capacity. Despite the progress
made in increasing installed generating capacity (from 1,700 MW in 1950 to
54,000 KW at present), supplies continue to be inadequate to meet demand in
full. Energy shortages are estimated to be equivalent to about 10% of current
supply and power shortages are estimated to range between 15% and 40% of
states' generating capacity. Institutional development of the sector, with the
exception of NTPC, has, in general, not kept pace with physical expansion of
supply.
3.       The principal impediments to further sector development are the poor
financial performance of most SEBs and inadequate resource mobilization. The
SEBs' performance reflects their lack of financial autonomy as well as a lack
of incentives for SEBs to improve performance. Inadequate resource
mobilization is a consequence of SEBs' low tariffs and inefficient operations,
as well as weaknesses in the financial structure of the sector. The principal
impediments to sector efficiency are institutional and planning shortcomings
and inefficient use of existing supply facilities. In part, these constraints
result directly from the high rate of system growth. GOI has mounted several
initiatives to tackle sector development and efficiency constraints. Most
notable amongst these are: (i) addressing the adequacy of the financial
policies and practices governing the operations of the SEBs; (ii) promoting
development of (relatively) low-cost hydroelectric projects through NHPC and
joint ventures with SEBs (of which the proposed project would be the first
instance); (iii) giving increased emphasis to transmission and distribution
facilities; (iv) reviewing its fuel supply policy for power generation by
increasing the use of natural gas, as well as by examining imported energy
options; (v) liberalizing its policy regarding private sector involvement in
power supply; and (vi) establishing the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) whose
functions are to mobilize additional resources for the sector, accelerate
implementation of priority investments and pursue institutional strengthening
of sector entities principally the SEBs.



-2-
4.       Some improvement in the sector is already evident.  For example:  a
number of SEBs have adopted commercial accounting practices; SEBs have
initiated studies to prepare master plans for their transmission and
distribution systems and most Bank-financed projects now include transmission
and distribution components; large combined-cycle gas fired plants are under
construction and the Government has appr(,ved the use of imported coal in some
proposed coastal power stations in the sout1h. The Bank maintains a close
dialogue with GOI on each of these policy initiatives and is planning, in
upcoming lending operations, to finance investments that will help realize
their objectives.
5.       The Northern Region of India, where the proposed project is located,
is experiencing acute shortages of power.  Unconstrained peak capacity
requirements in 1987 for the Region were estimated at 12,000 MW and annual
energy demand at 61,000 GWlh. The load met was only about 75% of unconstrained
power demand and only 90% of the energy requirements were supplied.
Projections prepared by the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) expect that
peak demand in 1995 will reach 25,600 MW. This implies annual growth of 9.6%
over the period 1987-95. Similarly, CEA projects energy demand will reach
131,000 GWh by 1995, equivalent to growth of 10% per annum. The least cost
power expansion plan prepared by CEA for the Region contemplates an increase
in installed capacity from 14,200 MW in 1987 to 28,300 NW in 1995 and includes
several hydroelectric schemes. The most important projects are: Chamera
(780 MW), being financed by the Canadian Government; Uri (480 NW), for which
GOI is negotiating bilateral assistance; Kholdam (600 NW), under construction;
Srinagar (330 MW), being financed by the Bank under the Uttar Pradesh Power
Project; and the proposed Nathpa Jhakri Scheme (1,500 MW). Because of GOI's
increased emphasis on development of hydroelectric projects,l/ the central
agencies responsible for planning and vetting hydroelectric projects
(principally CEA and CWC) have been taxed severely. The difficulties CEA and
CWC have encountered highlight the need for: (i) improved standards of
project preparation required to secure external financing; (ii) high-quality
bidding documents, required by the increased volume of procurement subject to
international tendering, as opposed to the traditional local tendering in
India; (iii) increased productivity in organizations responsible for
technical work, including introduction of state-of-the-art techniques in
engineering planning; and, (iv) improved system planning in the power sector.
Against this background, Bank involvement in the proposed project is aimed at
addressing each of these concerns.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.   The Bank's strategy for the power
sector in India is focussed on operations that would provide a catalytic
effect, principally in the two areas: first, improving sector efficiency by
supporting initiatives to strengthen planning, project implementation and
1/ India's hydroelectric potential is equivalent to about 100,000 NW;
16,000 MW have been developed, 4,700 NW are under construction and
23,000 MW are being studied for future development. Despite its
potential, hydroelectric capacity addition to India's power system has
declined from 34% under the Sixth Plan to 30% by the end of the Seventh
Plan.

systems' operations; second, strengthening the sector's financ.al performance
and resource mobilization through economic power pricing and realization of
revenues. Specific components of the proposed project provide direct support
for each of these objectives.
7.       Project Objectives.  The principal objectives of the proposed project
are to: (a) increase the power capacity of the Northern Region system;
(b) improve the reliability of supply and reduce system losses in Himachal
Pradesh; (c) strengthen the operational and financial performance of HPSEB;
and (d) improve and modernize the capabilities of central institutions for
preparation, design and construction supervision of hydropower projects.
8.       Proiect Description. Cost and Financing.  The project will consist
of: (a) construction of the 1,500 MW Nathpa Jhakri hydropower station on the
Sutlej river in Himachal Pradesh; (b) reinforcement and expansion of the
transmission system in the state of Himachal Pradesh; (c) provision of
communications facilities and a load dispatch facility for HPSEB;
(d) implementation of a program to strengthen HPSEB's management and
operations; (e) implementation of a training program to strengthen the
capabilities of CEA, CWC and other government institutions in the preparation,
design, and construction supervision of hydropower projects; and (f) training
and consulting services for the implementation of the above components. The
project, which would be carried out over 8 years, has an estimated total
financing requirement of US$1,837 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$!f 6 million (48%).  The proposed Bank loan would provide
financing for civil works, equipment and materials, training and consulting
services. The Bank has agreed to provide up to US$5 million equivalent, or
1.4% of the loan amount, for retroactive financing of expenditures incurred
after April 1, 1988 for field investigations and engineering works for the
preparation of detailed designs. GOI will be seeking about $300 million from
co-financiers to finance equipment. To facilitate this, about US$820 million
of procurement in excess of the proposed Bank financing will be subject to
International Competitive Bidding. Schedule A shows the estimated costs and
the financing plan. Schedule B gives details of amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements and the estimated schedule of disbursements.
Schedule C shows a timetable of key project processing events and Schedule D
gives the status of Bank Group operations in India. A map is attached. The
Staff Appraisal Report No. 7383-IN is being distributed separately.
9.       Agreed Actions.  Agreement has been reached with the Government of
India, the Government of Himachal Pradesh and NJPC on the following actions:
(a) NJPC will retain consultants to assist it in preparing detailed design and
supervise the construction of the power station. In this regard, NJPC will
issue a letter of intent to the selected consultants by June 30, 1989, and
will sign a contract with them within 60 days thereafter; (b) furnish for
Bank's comment, by December 31, 1989, the recommendations from the Utility
Management Study, and the Staffing and Training Program for HPSEB; (c) appoint
the coordinator for the CEA's and CWC's training program and furnish to the
Bank the proposed organization for the training ur.it; (d) ensure that NJPC
will achieve an annual rate of return before interest on the original cost of
its average net fixed assets in service of not less than 6% in FY98 and 12%
thereafter; (e) furnish to the Bank by December 31, 1990 a detailed proposal



on the tariff schedule for bulk sales of electricity from Nathpa Jhakri;
(f) enter into bulk-supply contracts, incorporating the agreed tariff
structure, with SEBs and any other major purchasers of electricity from Nathpa
Jhakri, by March 31, 1994, that is, one year before commissioning of the first
generating unit; (g) implement a financial action plan to ensure that HPSEB
will earn a rate of return after interest2/ of at least 2.9% in FY90, 3.8% in
FY91, 4.3% in FY92, 4.70 in FY93, 4.9% in FY94 and FY95, 7.00 in FY96 and
thoreafter.
10.      Water Rigbts, The proposed Nathpa Jhakri power station is located on
the Sutlej river, which originates in the TLbetan Plateau and flows into
Pakistan where it becomes a tributary of the Indus River. The Sutlej is
subject to the provisions of the 1960 Indus Water Treaty between India and
Pakistan. Under the terms of the Treaty India and Pakistan have agreed that
India has unrestricted use of the Sutlej before it crosses into Pakistan. The
proposed project is a run-of-the-river facility which will affect river flows
on a daily basls only. Any daily fluctuations will be fully attenuated over
the downstream reaches of the river, including at the Bhakra Dam in India
which has a live storage 1,700 times that of Nathpa Jhakri. The project does
not cause any upstream flooding because the water level in the diversion
pondage is controlled by the Bhaba power station located upstream in Himachal
Pradesh. In the assessment of Bank staff the proposed project would not cause
any harm to the interests of riparians.
11.      Resettlement and Environment.  In view of the absence of a major
reservoir, only 457 ha of land, mostly river bed, needs to be appropriated for
the proposed project. The diversion pond lies in a 300 m deep canyon, while
the rest of the works are underground. Hence, only about 73 families will
need to be resettled. HPSEB has prepared a detailed resettlement plan whereby
all displaced families will be provided with land of equivalent productive
capacity. The Bank has reviewed the plan and found it acceptable. Similarly,
in view of the location of the proposed project in a deep canyon with minimal
vegetation, and with no known water-borne diseases, environmental impact of
the project is expected to be minor. Moreover, the Bank is satisfied that
there are no archeological or cultural properties likely to be affected by the
proposed nrojec...   i  has cleared the scheme with regard to environmental and
forest aspects.
12.      Benefits.  The proposed project is part of the least cost expansion
program for the Northern Region. The Nathpa Jhakri power station, as well as
the extensions and reinforcements of transmission in Himachal Pradesh, will
help meet a higher proportion of the demand for electric power and energy ir.
the Northern Region, both of which presently are severely constrained. The
economic rate of return of the Northern Region development program
(1988-1996), of which the project is an integral part, is 14.3%.  The economic
rate of return of the Nathpa Jhakri power station is estimated to be 17.0%.
In addition to expanding the supply of electricity, the provision of
hydropeaking capacity will also result in fuel savings in captive generation
plants, will reduce utilization of inefficient thermal plants for peaking, and
during monsoon, will facilitate proper maintenance of thermal plants which,
2/ GOI definition: Net income as a percentage of net fixed historically
valued assets at the beginning of the financial year.



-5-
under present supply conditions is not always possible. Similarly the
strengtlhening of HPSEB'a transmission system and the provision of
communications and load dispatch facilities will substantially improve the use
of existing plant, reduce system losses, increase the quality of service to
customers and increase revenues for the SEB. The institutional development
plan would promote more efficient management and operation of the SEB with
beneficial impacts on service, quality, and economy.
13.      Risks.  The scale of the project is in some respects beyond any
hydropower project previously built in India.  In addition to the usual risks
associated with major underground works such as unexpected geological
conditions that may adversely affect the cost or the construction schedule, or
both, the project represents a major implementation challenge. The project
therefore provides for external qualified consultancy assistance for the
completion of detailed designs and for supervision of the construction. The
geological setting of the project has been well studied and the risks are
considered to be at an acceptably low level for the proposed work. Heavy
sediment loads carriod by the Sutlej river, particularly during rainy season
may result in frequency and costs of maintenance higher than average. Heavy
siltation of the intake works may restrict full load operation of the plant.
The project, however, provides for facilities to periodically flush the
sediments from the intake pond and to remove sediments from the water used for
generation. The selection and specifications of the equipment would be made
to minimize maintenance time and frequency. Other components of the project
do not present major risks.
14.      Rec9mm2DdatLq.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
