                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective is to strengthen the financial and operational management of the National Health Insurance Scheme by improving: (i) the policy
                         adaptation and implementation capacity of the National Health Insurance Council in addressing ongoing core policy issues related to contribution collection, risk
                         equalization, and provider payment mechanisms; and (ii) the purchasing function of the District Mutual Health Insurance Schemes, and the billing function of the
                         Providers.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         This an update based on the Bank's supervision mission in February 2013, and a May 2013 pre-appraisal mission of the Health Systems Strengthening Project (HSSP) with a
                         component to continue to support the health insurance system in Ghana.

                             The World Bank                                                                                                                                         Report No: ISR10694



                         The likelihood of achieving the Project Development Objective is downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory as only two outcome indicators out of four have met their target. The
                         Implementation Progress (IP) is maintained at Satisfactory. The Government has requested for a nine month extension to complete key project activities.

                         There are encouraging results of Health Insurance Project (HIP) implementation with two of the four PDO indicators having met their end of project targets. The two outcome

                         indicators that have met their targets are (i) proportion of total claims submitted by providers to NHIS (District Mutual Health Insurance Scheme or Claims Processing Center) for
                         processing that passed the initial screening; and (ii) proportion of total “clean? claims that are reimbursed by payers (NHIS) to providers within 60 days of claims receipt. Actions are
                         being taken to ensure that the target on electronic claims (eclaims) management system and the coverage of the poor will be met by end of the extended period. Since the eclaims
                         management system went live on April 1 2013, it has now been rolled out to 20 facilities out of the target 47, and 51697 claims have been submitted, vetted and paid through the
                         system as at May 28, 2013. While this number is increasing as and when additional facilities become operational the target will not be met by the current closing date. It will only be
                         met by the extended project closing in March, 2014. In the case of the indicator on coverage of the poor, the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) is working closely with the
                         relevant stakeholders, especially the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection and the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty Program (LEAP) and the Ministry of Health
                         in a nationwide exercise to increase the number of poor persons enrolled into the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). The target will be close to being met by the current
                         closing date of June 30, 2013. It will only be met fully by the extended project closing.

                         The procurement plan was also updated, showing actual dates for completed activities, with only minimal deviation between planned dates and actuals achieved; The capitation pilot
                         was completed and reviewed; accreditation of providers, gate keeper and referral policy training have all been completed under Component A - Streamlined Purchasing Policies and
                         Mechanisms. Under Component B - Strengthening Integrated Claims Management Systems, the Health Dictionary Data (HDD) is completed and efforts are underway for the hosting.

                         The project continues to be relevant as the objective of strengthening the financial and operational management of the Ghana National Health Insurance System is still one of the
                         priorities of Government as these are the issues raised for consideration in the Health Financing Report completed by the World Bank in 2011. As such the Government has
                         requested for continuous support for it.

                         Even though there were delays in project implementation activities, there has not been price escalations and therefore there were no adverse effect on the efficiency of the project.

                         While the country in the recent period has experienced power cuts that could have affected the health facilities' and District Health Insurance Schemes' ability to submit electronic
                         claims, measures were put in place to minimize the effects. Inverters were procured for all the facilities and the Claims Processing Center (CPC) to ensure constant power supply.
                         Thus power cuts will not affect their operations and there would be full utilization of the computerized claims management system that is being put in place under the project. Already
                         the beneficiaries have said that claims submission has become faster in the facilities that are already using the eclaims system and it has become paperless making it more efficient.
