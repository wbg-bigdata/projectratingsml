APPRAISAL OF THIRD CUhKUROVA POT3E PROJECT
SU111ARY
i.        The Turkish Government on behalf of the Cukurova M ectric
Company (CESC) has requested a Bank loan of US$11.5 million equivalent
to finance the foreign exchange costs of the 'Kadincik II hydroelectric
plant, consisting of a low diversion dam, outdoor powerhouse with a 50 MW
generating unit, penstocks and a 6 km tunnel. Total estimated cost is
US$17.2 million equivalent, including interest payable during the
construction period. Commercial operation is scheduled for late
1972.
ii.       The IDA has extended two credits to the Government for relending
to CEC.  The first (34-TU, 1963) for US$1.7 million equivalent was for
adding a third 18 iiW unit to the Company's Seyhan hydroelectric plant and
the complete plant is now in satisfactory operation. The second Credit
(59-TU), in 1964 for US$24 million equivalent, is helping to fina,nce the
Kadincik I hydroelectric plant of 70 Mn upstream of the proposed Project,
a thermal plant of 100 Mw near Mersin, and associated transmission lines
and facilities.  Disbursements were USt15.2 million as of April 30, 1969.
The closing date is June 30, 1971. Quality of the work is excellent.
Construction progress is now satisfactory, although it had been affected
by the dealy in starting some features of the works, following the
recommendations of the consulting engineer.
iii.      Recently, there has been an unfavorable trend in CEC's
financial position, largely due to the rapid expansion of operations.
This situation promises to be corrected by the proposed financing plan
which includes a tariff increase, a new stock issue, and the sale of
bonds; and the future financial position is forecast to be sound. The
Company's operations are being managed satisfactorily. To improve
financial planning and meet the anticipated technical requirements of
a more complex power system, some additional training of personnel is
needed and would be provided for under the proposed Project.
iv.       The proposed Project is technically sound.  Assuming that the
cost of capital in the power sector does not exceed 17%o, it represents
the least cost alternative for meeting the growing demand of CEC's
market and promises to yield a satisfactory incremental rate of return.
With the assistance of its engineering consultant, the Company has
the capability to carry out the Project.
v.        The amount of the loan is based on the estimated foreign ex-
change costs and any savings would be cancelled. Proceeds of the loan
would finance contracts for foreign goods and services or the foreign
component of contracts also involving local costs.



- ii -
vi.       Satisfactory agreement was reached during negotiation on
the items summarized in paragraph 7.04 of this report, including a
tariff increase prior to effectiveness of the proposed loan. In
view of this, the proposed Project forms a suitable basis for a Bank
loan of US$115. million equivalent for a term of 25 years, including
four years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF THIRD CUKUROVA POWER PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of the Kadincik II Project
of the Cukurova Electric Company (CEC) of Adana, on whose behalf the
Turkish Government has requested Bank Group assistance. The Project
consists of a hydroelectric plant on the lower Kadincik River, about
50 km west of Adana.  Total cost is estimated at US$17.2 million equiv-
alent, including interest on the Bank loan payable during the 3-year
construction period. The proposed Bank loan would finance all of the
foreign exchange component of US$11.5 million.
1.02      The Bank made a Loan (63-TU) of US$22.8 million equivalient to
the Turkish Government in 1952 to help finance the multi-purpose Seyhan
project at Adana. At the Bank's suggestion, CEC was formed in 1953 to
purchase and operate the powerhouse of the Seyhan hydroelectric facility,
which was built by the State Water TWorks (DSI), the Government agency
responsible for river development. An IDA Credit (34-TU) of US$1.7 mil-
lion equivalent was extended to the Government for relending to CEC in
February 1963 to finance the foreign exchange cost of the third 18 MW
unit at Seyhan. The relending terms were 5 1/2% interest with repayment
in 20 years including a grace period of two years, later extended to
seven years. The third unit was installed on schedule and the complete
plant has operated satisfactorily since late 1964.
1.03      A second IDA Credit (59-TU) of US$24 million equivalent was
extended to the Government for relending to CEC in July 1964 to help
finance the first Kadincik hydroelectric plant of 100 NWpJ (upstream of
proposed Kadincik II), a thermal plant of 50 IV near Mersin, and asso-
ciated transmission lines and facilities. The relending terms were
5 1/2% interest with repayment in 25 years including a grace period of
six years.  On the basis of final studies, CEC's consulting engineering
firm recormmended substantial changes in the project; and in May 196$7
IDA agreed to reduce the Kadincik plant to 70 MW, increase the Mersin
plant to 100 MW, and add some transmission facilities. In August 1968
the IDA agreed to add further transmission facilities and provide for
engineering studies of future projects. The first 50 FW of the Mersin
thermal plant has been completed, and production started in 1966; the
second half is under construction. Construction started late on the
Kadincik plant by reason of the change in plan. There will be later
completion dates, but no serious problem is anticipated, since sales
have lagged behind original market predictions by about one year. All
facilities have been or will be placed in service immediately upon com-
pletion.

1.04      Other Bak lending for power in Turkey (see para. 2.03) consists
of a US$25 million loan in October 1968 to help finance 1,460 km of 380' kV
transmission line. The Bank has also made a grant of US$550,000 to study
the reorganization of the power industry in Turkey.
1.05      This report was prepared by Ralph L. Bloor and Giovanni Vacchelli,
and is based upon the findings of an appraisal mission to Turkey in November/
December 1968.
II.  THE POIWER SECTOR AND THE CEC SYSTEM
2.01      Turkey, lying mostly in Asia Minor and partly in Europe, has a
total area of about 770,000 km2 and a population estimated in 1967 at
32.7 million.  From 1960 through 1967 the GDP, at constant prices, grew
at an average annual rate of 5.3%; however, a 2.5% rate of population
growth resulted in an increase of GDP per capita of only about 2.8,%. While
about three-fourths of the labor force is engaged in farming and related
occupations, the agriculture sector contributes only about one-third of the
GDP (estimated at US$11.3 billion in 1967). The second 5-year plan (1968-72)
emphasizes the manufacturing sectors with a high technology input, such as
chemicals, steel, engineering and electrical industries. Private iLnvestment
is expected to play a major role. In the power sector, investments of about
TL 8.7 billion are expected to increase power production from 6,200 GWh in
1967 to 11,800 GlWh in 1972 -- an increase of 14% per year compared with an
increase in consumption during the first plan period of 11.5% per year.
The Sector
2.02      The total capacity of generating plant in Turkey at the end of
1967* was 1,950 MW. Of this, 1,327 MW was connected to systems ownied and
operated by Etibank, a State Enterprise which owms a large portion of CEC
stock; 519 lfM was installed in a number of small and isolated municipal-
ities, villages and private industrial plants. The balance of 104 KH -
5% of the total - constitutes the present CEC system, which will increase
to 224 MW in 1970 when the works under construction are expected to be
completed.
2.03      In October 1968 the Bank made its first loan to the national
electricity system operated by Etibank. The loan is to help finance a
380 kV transmission line 1,460 km long extending from the 1,240 MW Keban
Hydroelectric Plant under construction on the Euphrates River to Istanbul.
The Bank has also made a grant of $550,000 for the first stage of a study
of the reorganization of the power industry in Turkey. This work, com-
prising preparation of accounting and engineering standards, has been com-
pletedby Stone & Webster, a consulting firm of the U.S.A. The second phase
of the study covering implementation of the recommendations and revaluing
of assets has been deferred pending the passage of a law which will, enable
the reorganization to proceed.
* Latest data available for the entire sector.

2.04      The CEC system, now isolated, serves one of the most rapidly
developing agricultural areas in Turkey (see map). In 1970 and 1971,
when a power shortage in the Etibank systems is anticipated, CEC is ex-
pected to have a surplus of power for its needs. Etibank is building a
154 kV connection from its grid so that it may buy this surplus, esti.mated
at 220 GEM for 1970 and 100 GWh for 1971. The sale of power to Etibank
may begin in late 1969, if either the Mersin thermal plant or the Kadincik
I hydroelectric plant is ready for full commercial operation by that time.
CEC Facilities
2.05      The operating facilities of CEC consist of the Seyhan 54 MW
hydroelectric plant3 the Mersin thermal plant (first 2 of 4 units, 25 NW
each), a 118 km 154 kV transmission line, several 66 kV lines totalling
206 km, and 9 substations totalling 213 MAU. No distribution facilities
are involved, because CEO sells only bulk power (see para. 5.03). All
except the Seyhan plant were built by CEC. The Seyhan plant is part of
a multi-purpose river project (power, irrigation, flood control). For
the purpose of flood control, a portion of the storage volume is kept
empty.
2.06      The following CEO facilities are under construction:
i. The Kadincik I hydroelectric plant of 70 MW, to
be completed by the end of 1969 or early 1970.
ii.  The last 2 units (25 1I4 each) of the Mersin thermal
plant, to be completed by October 1969.
iii. A 6 km 66 kV transmission line, to be completed in
June 1969.
iv. 88 km of 154 kV transmission lines, to be completed
by November 1969.
v.  6 substations or substation extensions totalling
182 MVA, to be completed by June 1970.
Future Program
2.07      The following construction is planned for the period 1969-1974:
i.  The Kadincik II hydroelectric plant of 50 1f4
to be completed by the end of 1972.
ii.  Several 154 kV transmission lines totalling
270 km to connect new portions of CEC's service
area to the system.
iii.  4 substations totalling 184 EVA.
Planning is incomplete beyond 1973. Although a new source of power will be
needed by 1974, as noted below, it has yet to be identified.



- 4 -
2.08     The Government is proposing a multi-purpose Aslantas project
to be built by DSI on the Ceyhan River, just east of the Seyhan River,
and is urging CEC to participate. Although this proposed project would
be favorably located to fit into the CEC system, the power feature of
84 MW does not appear, on the basis of available information, to be
economically attractive. On DSI's request, two foreign engineering firms
(Syndibel of Belgium and Acres of Canada) will give it further study.  In
the meantime, IDA has authorized expenditure from Credit 59-TU to employ
an engineering firm to survey the area near CEC's service area for other
hydroelectric sites. IThen the studies are completed, it may be possible
to select a hydroelectric project that will meet CEC's need for additional
power in 1974. If such a project cannot be identified, a high-tension
connection to the national grid to enable CEC to purchase power from
Etibank may be the solution because of the completion of Keban and other
large projects which will be connected to the grid by that time. Since
these alternatives are still to be explored, a firm prediction of the
expansion program beyond Kadincik II cannot be made at this time.
III. THE PROJECT
Description
3.01     The proposed Kadincik II Project consists of a low diversion
dam, a long and nearly horizontal tunnel under low head, and penstocks
dropping steeply to an above-ground powerhouse at river level. The
site is a short distance doimstream of the Kadincik I plant under con-
struction; the powerhouse will be just downstream of the mouth of the
Kadincik River wrhere it discharges into the Tarsus. 1when both Kadincik
projects are completed, they will fully develop the river's power poten-
tial. The proposed Project has been planned by Syndibel of Belgium, CEC's
engineering consultant.
3.02     The diversion dam would be a concrete structure wiith radial
gates 11 m wide by 11.5 m high, the latter dimension being nearly equal
to the height of the dam. These gates must pass floods without unduly
raising the tail-water of Kadincik I and at the same time provide for
sediment evacuation from the small reservoir created by the dam. The
dam provides very little storage; however, the daily storage provided
in Kadincik I will also be available to Kadincik II. The dam diverts
water into a concrete-lined tunnel, 5.9 km in length and about 4 m in
diameter, which is extended to above the powerhouse site by a steel
conduit about 1.4 km in length. A surge tank and valve are at the end
of this conduit, do=nstream of which a steel penstock slopes steeply to
the powerhouse near the river bank. The powerhouse would be of the usual
concrete construction wzith a single 50 -ffi turbo-generator set operating
under a net head of 129 m. The generating facilities will be remotely
controlled from Kadincik I.  There will be a step-up substation, but no
new transmission facilities are required since the lines from Kadincik I
to Tarsus are routed past the site and are designed to carry the output
of Kadincik II.



- 5 -
3.03      CEC has proposed to include under the loan a training program
that would consist mainly of sending local personnel abroad to receive
instruction for a few months. Although the program undoubtedly would be
useful, it i#ould not be intensive nor long enough to accomplish the
desired results. In addition to training abroad, it appears necessary
to hire some experts in the most needed fields to work within CEC for
about a year and give on-the-job training. To cover the foreign exchange
cost of a year's effort along this line, additional amounts are included
in the proposed loan. (see para. 5.02)
Cost Estimate
3.04      The total estimated cost of the Kadincik II Project is sum-
marized below; details are in Annex 1.

TOTAL              50.82  103.50  154.32       5.65   11.50   17.15
The estimate was prepared by Syndibel and CEC, using quantities taken off
preliminary drawings and unit prices derived from experience on Kadincik I,
*which is being built under the same hydrologic, ge.ologic and metereologic
conditions. Contingency allow ances are included, at the rate of 16% for
the civil wtorks and 10% for the equipment and other expenses - an average
of about 13% for the entire Project. These allowances are considered
adequate. The 16% contingency allowance for civil works is reasonable
because the Project follows closely a similar one.
3.05      It is proposed to provide a Bank loan of about US$11.5 million
equivalent, for 25 years including 4 years of grace, to cover all of the
foreign exchange costs including interest during construction. The Project
could be ready for commercial operations by December 1972; however,
Syndibel estimates that it could be advanced to September 1972 if K:adincik I
is completed by late 1969 and construction equipment moved expeditiously to
Kadincik II.
* Consulting engineering, administration and supervision, personnel
training, and land.



-6-
Procurenent
3.06      CEC will follow Bank procedures for procurement, i.e., inter-
national competitive bidding for the civil works and all equipment, as
was the case with Kadincik I.  No contracts have yet been made. Foreign
contractors, especially the one for the civil works, will no doublt obtain
goods and services from local firms and suppliers whenever it suits them
to do so.
3.07      Proceeds of the loan wiould finance contracts or purchase orders
for foreign equipment, engineering, and training. Those for civil works
would be a part of the periodic payments to the contractor so that; total
disbursements would equal the foreign component of the civil works con-
tract. Proceeds unutilized for any item would be available for ary other
item including interest during construction. Overall savings wqould be
v           cancelled.
Engineering
3.08      CEO intends to continue using the services of its engineering
consultant, Syndibel, for the preparation of detailed plans and specifi-
cations and for supervision of construction. Syndibel's services for
these purposes in the Kadincik I project are satisfactory.
Operation of the Plants
3.09      The Kadincik II plant (and also Kadincik I) will be essentially
a run-of-river facility with only daily storage available. Other facili-
ties in CEC's system have storage or use fuel. Therefore, the twTo
Kadincik plants may be expected to operate every day, using all the water
available (up to their full capacity) each day. During high flows the
plants wTould operate on baseload; during low flows they would be used for
peaking purposes.

,   Includes sales of bulk power to the national grid.
The annual increases during the years of record (1965-1968) vary from
about 16% to 28%J in both energy and peak requirements.  The rapid growth
is due both to the vigorous economy of the region and the expansion of
the transmission system into new areas. The estimates for 1969-1971 are
based upon a survey of present customers' plans and Government plans for
building in the area a fertilizer plant and steel mill as well as other
industries. In case of delays in Government building schedules, more
capacity could be devoted to the national grid. The computation of the
above figures is complicated by the plan to supply surplus energy and
capacity to the grid in 1970 and 1971; thus the increases are abnormally
high between 1969 and 1970 and zero between 1970 and 1971. After 1971 the
annual increases are estimated at 10%. This situation is satisfactory.

4.02      In 1972, before Kadincik II is in operation, the generating plant
available will be:
Mersin            (4 units)        100 Igitq
Seyhan            (3 units)         51 1jT
Kadincik I        (2 units)         70 4WJ
Total           224 MW
Thus, the 1972 peak requirement of 225 nW could barely be met and there
would be no reserves. Since these figures are based on an average year,
in event of a dry year in 1972 there would be a shortage (estimated at
15 NJ). To meet the peak in December of that year, it is therefore im-
portant that Kadincik II be completed on schedule in late 1972, thus
making available 274 TW of generating capacity.  The 1973 peak of 248 M1I
can then be met with about 25 Hil reserves, a minimum requirement for the
CEC system. In 1974 additional plant will be needed to preserve some
reserve capacity, as well as meet energy requirements.
Alternative Project
4.03      The only reasonable alternative to the Kadincik II hydroelectric
plant which could be available when needed, as well as fit into the system,
would be an oil-fired steam plant. A study made by Syndibel to determine
the least cost choice between Kadincik II and a thermal plant indicated
that present value of the costs of the alternatives would be equal at a
discount rate of about 17%. Therefore, assuming that the cost of capital
in the power sector does not exceed about 17%, 'Kadincik II represents the
least-cost solution to 1972 power requirements.
Rate of Return on Incremental Investment
4.04      As indicated in paragraph 3.09, the Kadincik II plant may be
assumed to operate on all the water available in the river up to the plant's
capacity. Therefore, the saleable output of the plant may be assumed to
be equal to that of a year of average flow corrected for losses. On this
basis the rate of return on the investment would be between 15% and 16%,
using tariffs expected to be in effect in 1972 when the plant would go
into operation (see Annex 5 for details).
V. THE CUIUROVA ELECTRIC COMPANY
Organization
5.01      CEC was formed in 1953 when the Government granted it a 149-
year concession to purchase and operate the powerhouse at the DSI-built
Seyhan Dam (see para. 1.02). Operations began in 1956. An over-run in
the cost of the powerhouse and the 1958 devaluation complicated the
final settlement (see para. 6.04), which was not reached until 1961.
CEC's structure is that of a corporation with a majority of privately
held stock. The Board of Directors is composed of a chairman, three other



- 9 -
representatives of the private stockholders and three representatives of
Etibank, holder of the Government's minority interest. The supervising
authority is the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources.  The Company's
operating organization is headed by a general manager and three assistant
general managers (operations, administration and finance, projects and
installations). There were 528 employees in 1968. The organization has
performed efficiently since 1961, when the present chairman of the! Board
was appointed, despite the fact that the Company has had four general
managers in the same period. The chairman is a prominent local figure
and has good managerial ability. His participation in C3C1s management
has been an important factor in its success.
5.02      There are some organizational problems, which are proposed to
be solved by training local personnel up to an adequate level of competence.
(as noted in para. 3.03).  In the small agricultural town of Adana the
availability of trained and talented people is limited; furthermore, it is
difficult to retain personnel who are not local residents. As generating
and transmission systems become more complex, more highly skilled personnel
will be needed. Also, because of the lack of staff experience in modern
utility practices and accounting methods, the Company's financial forecasting
and planning are not fully adequate.
The Concession
5.03      The original CEC concession was revised in 1968.  The new text,
approved by IDA, is expected to become effective in the coming months.
This revised concession, which expires in 2013, provides a little more
flexibility in the buying and selling of power and in the tariff adjust-
ment procedure. CW, generates and sells wholesale energy in the Provinces
of Icel, Adana and Hatay and transmits energy outside the boundaries of
the concession area. Energy may be sold to municipalities for distribu-
tion, and directly to industries with an installed capacity of more than
500 KW; upon the municipalities' authorization, industries with a lesser
installed capacity could also be supplied directly.  The shareholdersare
entitled to recover their investment in the company over the life of the
concession, after which the property would be turned over to the Govern-
ment. W4hile the mechanics are yet to be defined, the recovery is expected
to start by 1971. The concession is satisfactory.
Tariff Regulation
5.04      The concession permits tariffs to be set at such a level as
to cover all operating expenses, including maintenance, taxes, depre-
ciation, amortization of CEO's investment and interest charges, and
to provide a reasonable return on equity. This return has allowed
distribution of dividends to the shareholders at 15` of par value.
At the time of IDA Credit 59-TU, it was agreed with IDA that revenues
should also provide a contribution to the construction program through
1969 (see para. 6.07). Tariffs are set for a 3-year period, after which
they are subject to review and adjustment by the Ministry. On the other
hand, CEC may at any time request new tariffs, subject to approval by
the Ministry upon examination of the supporting evidence. A tariff



- 10 -
increase will be necessary in 1969 to improve the Company's earnings
and provide a reasonable contribution to the construction of Kadincik II
(see para. 6.13).
Customers
5.05      As of November 1968, CEO was selling power in bulk to 25 towns
and villages which distribute it.  Also, CEC supplied directly 44 in-
dustrial plants and 28 non-industrial establishments (such as the military
air base in Adana, the port at i4ersin, various D6I pumping installations,
etc.). In the 11 towns using more than 50 kW each, the breakdown of con-
sumers was as follows:
Domestic       102,300
Commercial       30,800
Industrial       7,800
In 1968 industrial consumption accounted for 63% of total sales.
5.06      Customers' contributions are required to finance connections
which CEO cannot economically provide. CEO's policy has been to transfer
to income 5% of the customers' contributions accumulated at year end, with
the exception of 1967 when all of the year's contributions were passed
directly to income. In the future CEC will revert to the previous policy,
which is acceptable.
5.07      Billing and collection do not present any problem, although the
total time now required (1 to 1-1/2 months) could probably be reduced. It
has been suggested to CEC that its advisors (see para.3.03) consider
ways to reduce the time.
Audit
5.08      Under the terms of the concession, CEC is subject to Government
audit, and, as a condition of Credit 59-TUE which has been maintained, has
agreed to an independent audit. Since 1964, CEC's accounts have been
audited  by   Newbery & Company, an experienced Istanbul firm, which also
has performed a useful advisory function. Present arrangements are
satisfactory. However, CEC has been encouraged to ask for further assistance,
especially in financial forecasts and in improving internal reporting for
management information.

VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
The Current Situation
6.01      As of December 31, 1968, preliminary figures show that CEC
had gross fixed assets in operation of TL 255 million (US$28.3 million)
and work in progress of about TL 111 million (Us$12.3 million).  Most of
the financing had been provided by IDA credits and by the sale of capital
stock, as shown in the following table:

Total                         348.6              100.0
6.02      In 1968 CEC received final payments of a TL 65 million stock
issue, fully subscribed by 1965 as part of the financing plan set up under
Credit 59-TU. Of the total TL 100 million capital stock outstanding the
public sector owns 43% (the greatest part being Etibank s holdings of
40%); the remaining 57% is held by about 3,900 private individuals and
organizations, many of which are CEC1s consumers. Total equity, which
includes various reserves, the surplus account and the year's unappro-
priated net income, amounted to about 40% of total capitalization.



- 12 -
6.03      The long term debt consisted mainly of the proceeds of JIIA
Credits 34-TU and 59-TU, outstanding for TL 14.6 million and TL 124.6
million respectively. Amortization will start in 1970 on both Subsi-
diary Loans which bear an interest rate of 5 1/2% per annum. In connec-
tion with Credit 59-TU and as a contribution to CEC's investment program,
the Government agreed with IDA and CEC to: a) extending the grace period
on 34-TU: the credit will thus be amortized in 13 years, from 1970 to
1983 (see para. 1.02); and b) deferring interest on both Credits until 1970,
except for the 0.75% corresponding to the service charge payable by the
Government to IDA. The remaining 4.75% is to accrue interest free, and
will be amortized in equal installments pari passu with the principal of
the respective credits; as of December 31, 1968 it represented TL 14.6
million.
6.o4      The debt to DSI results from the 1961 agreement between CEC
and the Government, which settled the financial obligations of the zompany
in taking over the power facilities of the Seyhan project (see para. 5.01).
The debt, outstanding as of December 31, 1968 for TL 38.4 million, will
be fully repaid by 1977. It represents the unamortized balance of: a) the
portion of cost not covered by the original capital stock issue, and
b) the exchange loss incurred on the portion of Bank Loan 63-TU allocated
to the power facilities as a result of the 1958 devaluation. Under the
terms of the agreement, interest arrears are added to the 4.75% current
interest charges and are charged to income.
6.05      Debt financing is completed by the deferment of custonEduties
on imported equipment, which the Company is allowed to pay in annuaL
installments over six years from incurrence.
Past Earnings
6.06      Actual and forecast income statements for the period 1964
*         through 1973 are presented in Annex 2.  Between 1964 and 1966 CEC's
operations, based on the Seyhan hydro plant only, were satisfactory:
the rate of return on average fixed assets in operation was in the order
of 19% and net income per share, after corporate taxes, averaged abcut
23% of par value. These results were achieved while charging straight-
line depreciation at the high rates permitted by Turkish tax laws,
resulting in about 4.5% of aggregate assets. Dividends were consistently
paid at 15% to 17% of par value, a policy which, although conservative by
Turkish standards, has contributed to the good reputation of the Company
among investors. However, the results for 1967 and 1968 have been less
favorable. The rapid market development could be met only with thermal
capacity (Mersin 1); this resulted in operating expenses increasing more
than proportionately to revenues, because of fuel costs and higher Plain-
tenance and depreciation charges. The rate of return, adjusted to off-
set a change in the treatment of customers' contributions in 1967 (see
para. 5.06), fell to 12.7% in that year and, on the basis of preliminary
results, was 12.2% in 1968.  Similarly, net income per share, after
corporate taxes, fell to 17% of par value in 1967 and is expected to be
only 15% in 1968. Although CEO's ample cash reserves would enable it to



- 13 -
maintain its dividend record without difficulty, this would imply in 1968
a distribution of about TL 2 million out of past retained earnings.  This
situation is clearly undesirable and indicates the need for a tariff
adjustment which was agreed upon during negotiations (see para. 6.13).
Performance Test
6.07      Both existing IDA Credits contain a tariff covenant which
requires CEC to obtain a "reasonable surplus" after appropriate operating
charges and dividends. This formulation was more acceptable to the Govern-
ment than the introduction of a rate of return concept, since it paraphrased
the language of the concession. It provides adequately for: a) remunera-
ting the shareholders, and b) ensuring a reasonable proportion of self-
financing. A side letter further specified that the Company should be able
to provide, during the 1964-1969 period, at least 16% of new investments in
power facilities out of its own funds, consisting of: a) net internal
cash generation, and b) a draw down from accumulated cash reserves not
exceeding the equivalent of US$1.5 million. On the basis of available
information, this test would be met, in spite of the very low contribution
(only 6%) expected for 1969, due to delays in the construction program
resulting in a concentration of investments in that year.
6.08      Except for the earnings-squeeze beginning in 1967, as discussed
in para. 6.06, CEC's performance has been satisfactory and its financing
pattern sound. The debt/equity ratio as of December 31, 1968, was 60/40
and current assets, characterized by a good liquidity, were 1.8 times
current liabilities. The level of inventories, at TL 9.7 million, appears
high but prudently allows for the difficulties that an urgent need for an
imported item would create under the Turkish system of import quotas.
Future Finances
6.09      Between 1969 and 1972, when the proposed Project would be
completed, CEC's TL 341 million investment in new power facilities
(see paras. 2.06 and 2.07) will almost equal total investments made up
to 1968. In fact, about TL 300 million will be spent between 1969 and
1971 (TL 135 million this year), covering completion of the Kadincik I
and Mersin II power plants. Debt service will also add to the increasing
financial requirements: by 1970 it will reach a level about double that
of 1968, because of amortization starting under both IDA Credits and the
related deferred interest (see para. 6.03).
6.10      The proposed 1969-1972 financing plan is summarized in the
following table. In terms of the construction expenditures, Bank group
financing would contribute about 53%; this includes the proposed Bank
1 loan (29,) and disbursements under Credit 59-TU (240). Proposed sales
of bonds are intended to provide a 3% contribution. The tariff increase
would allow net internal cash generation to contribute 27%, which is
satisfactory. A new stock issue would provide about 9%, and the
balance would be provided by customers' contributions and Government
credits. This plan is realistic and the increased proportion of self-



- 14 -
financing constitutes an improvement on past financing patterns (see
para. 6.01). Annex 3 presents in detail sources and applications of funds
for 1968 through 1973.  (The apparent cash surplus shown in 1973 is attrib-
utable principally to the inability at present to quantify construction
expenditures which will be required in that year when the next power
generating development is defined.)

6.11      Borroiuings would cover about 62% of the construction expenditures
and, as mentioned, -would consist to a large extent of Bank group f'inancing.
The proposed Bank loan, of TL 103.5 million (Us$11.5 million equivalent),
would cover the foreign exchange component of the Project, including in-
terest during construction; a term of 25 years is proposed, including four
years of grace, and an interest rate of 6-1/2% has been assumed. Dis-
bursements wjould total about TL 100 million between 1969 and 1972, with the
balance to be utilized in 1973 to meet retention payments. Debt f'inancing
would also include: a) the sale of TL 5 million of bonds in each of the years
1970 and 1971, at an interest rate of 14% and amortization terms of five
years plus one year of grace; b) disbursements under Credit 59-TU (about
TL 83 million); c) deferment of customs duties (about TL 13 million), and
d) deferment of interest under the IDA Credits relending arrangements
(about TL 8 million, in 1969 only).
6.12      The stock issue of TL 25 million has been fully subscribed at
a 20% premium. The full TL 30 million proceeds would be paid in by
October 1969.
6.13      The tariff increase is necessary to provide a more adequate
earnings base for meeting the forthcoming financial requirements   The Govern-
ment has agreed to act on an application by CEO for an increase in tariffs.
The increase will be irVlemented before the proposed loan is effective. This
report assumes average revenues will be incroased October 1969 by 1.6 kurus,or
about 13%, for sal.s in GM's market, i.e., exclusive of sales to Etibank.
The increase is essential to improve CEC's earnings during the 19659-1971
period, when: a) the commissioning of the Kadincik I and Mersin II plants
would result in a sharp increase in operating expenses, mainly because of
fuel costs and depreciations b) interest charges would be almost twice as
high as past charges; and c) although CEC's own market would be growing
at an annual average rate of about 21%, sales to Etibank's system at a pre-
ferential tariff (estimated at 7.25 kurus per kwh) would result in earnings
growing less than proportionately to sales.
6.14      The financing plan would be completed by customers' contributions,
in the order of TL 2.5 million per year. It would be supported by varia-
tions in the ample existing working capital: cash reserves would be drawin
down in 1969 and 1971, when the construction program peaks, and would be
replenished in 1970 and 1972, for a small net variation over the period.
6.15      The proposed financing plan is satisfactory.  However, it does
not take into account a possible additional requirement of funds,, for
which sufficient information was not available at the time of the appraisal.
CEC is very seriously considering acquiring a stock participation in Kepez,
a private utility serving Axntalya; the reason for this move wiould be to
facilitate future expansion of the concession area, in view of the expected
tourism development of the Antalya region.  A part of atibank's participation
would be offered to the public in the near future, and CEC is planning a
TL 8 million investment to obtain control of the company.  During negotiations
CEC has agreed not to proceed with this plan during the construction period
of the proposed Project, uithout having demonstrated its justification to
the Bank's satisfaction. In particular a market study, an evaluat:ion of



- 16 -
Kepez' position and of the consequent financial or managerial responsibili-
ties of CEC would be required.
Future Earnings and Financial Position
6.16      On the basis of the tariff increase, CEC's future earnings would
be satisfactory.  The rate of return would fall to a  relatively low
10.3% in 1969, when it is affected by substantial additions to assets in
operation and benefits only in part from the tariff adjustment.  It would
however rapidly improve, remaining at or above 16% from 1971. Net income
per share, after corporate taxes, would average 30% of par value between
1969 and 1972, thus allowing CEC to continue its policy of distributing
dividends at 15% of par. From 1970, net internal cash generation would
represent more than 23% of construction expenditure, a satisfactory level
in view of the availability of new share capital.
6.17      Under the tariff covenant in Credit 59-TU (see para. 6.07) the
level of self-financing is defined through 1969 only, and is to be
renegotiated after then. It has been agreed that during the construction
period of the proposed Project, 1970-72, CEC would maintain tariffs at
a level that would provide, in each year, for at least 23% of the year's
construction expenditures to be financed out of net internal cash generation.
In determining this latter quantity, internal cash generation will be
taken net of debt service, dividends, staff bonuses, and corporate taxes.
The uncertainties about future expansion programs and their financing
(see para. 2.08) make it unrealistic to define any specific target beyond
1972.
6.18      Annex 4 presents actual and forecast balance sheets as of December
31, 1964 through 1973. The forecast financial position would be satisfactory:
notwithstanding the cash draw down in 1969 and 1971, the current ratio would
never fall below unity and would average more than 1.1 in the 1969-1972
period.  This level is satisfactory in view of the good liquidity of the
current assets and the fact that current liabilities consist principally
of current maturities. Debt, including current maturities, would reach
62% of total capitalization in 1969, and would decrease thereafter.
6.19     11aximum future interest payable, including interest on the
proposed Bank loan, would be covered 1.76 times by 1969 income, adjusted
to take into account the recommended tariff increase. The present covenant,
which requires a 1.75 times coverage, is repeated. On an annual basis,
total debt service would be covered by internal cash generation at; least
2 times, which is satisfactory.
6.20      In summary, following resolution by a tariff adjustment of the
problem discussed in paragraph 6.06, CEC's performance is expected to be
satisfactory and adequate for supplementing the external financing, during
the execution of the expansion program.

VII. CONCLUSIONS
7.01      The Project, is technically sound and represents the least cost
alternative to meet the growth in demand by 1972, provided the cost of
capital in the power sector does not exceed about 17o.
7.02      CEC's management, assisted by its engineering consultant
Syndibel, is capable of executing the Project. The organization of the
Company is satisfactory, and staff will be trained and reinforced to cope
with expanding operations.
7.03      Past financial performance and compliance with existing covenants
have been satisfactory. However, because of the sustained pace of ex-
pansion, present tariff levels have become insufficient; a tariff increase
of about 13% is therefore necessary. The financing plan, which also includes
a TL 25 rillion stock issue at a 20% prerium, and the sale of TL 10 million
of bonds, is realistic; CEC's forecast performance and financial position
are satisfactory.
7.04      The Project formns a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$115.
million equivalent, for a term of 25 years including four years of grace.
During negotiations agreement has been reached on the following:
i. CEO will continue to employ engineering
consultants satisfactory to the Bank (see para. 3.08);
ii. CEC will retain experts to assist and train the
staff in the fields of technical operations,
accounting methods and financial planning (see
para. 3.03);
iii.  CEC will continue to retain auditors satisfactory
0                         to the Banl= (see para. 5.08);
iv.  bonds will be sold in the amount of TL 5 millions
in each of the years 1970 and 1971 (see para. 6.11);
v.  satisfactory arrangements have been made to ensure
the placement of a TL 25 million stock issue at a
20%. premium (see para. 6.12);
vi.  prior to the effectiveness of the proposed loan,
tariffs will be adjusted to produce an increase
of not less than 1.6 kurus in the average revenue
per kWh on sales in CEC's market (see para. 6.13);
vii. during the construction period of the Project,
1970-72, tariffs would be maintained at such
a level as to provide at least a 23% contribution
from net internal cash generation to the year's
construction program (see para. 6.17);



- 18 -
viii.  during the construction period of the Project
CEC will seek the Bank's consent before under-
takcing any significant expansion of its invest-
ments by wray of acquisition or construction
(see paras. 2.08 and 6el5); and
ix. CEC will not incur any indebtedness if, after the
incurrence of such debt, and for any succeeding
fiscal year, total interest payments would not be
covered at least 1.75 times by the past fiscal
year's income (see para. 6.19).

Rate of Return on Incremental Investment
The method followed to determine the rate of return on the
incremental investment consists of comparing the streams of costs and
benefits attributable to the Project. In the calculation, the following
elements have been taken into consideration:
*                      Costs
i. Investments in the Kadincik II generating facilities
between 1969 and 1972, net of interest during cons-
truction and of customs duties on imported equipment;
and
ii. Operating and Maintenance costs, including insurance
and overheads.
Benefits
iii. The revenues on incremental sales attributable to
the Project, calculated at tariffs expected to be
effective by the time the facility would be com-
missioned; and
iv. For 1973 only, the fuel savings obtained operating
the facility in lieu of the Mersin thermal plant.
The resulting streams of costs and benefits are shown on page 2. The
rate of return on the incremental investment is the discount rate at
which the present value of costs equals the forecast value of benefits.
This rate of return is between 15% and 16%.
