INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATON
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO MALAWI
FOR A TRANSPORT ENGINEERING
AND SERVICES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Malawi, for the equivalent of $2.0 million, to
finance part of the foreign exchange cost of engineering and other
technical services required to prepare and develop a wood processing project
in Malawi. Part of the program is being financed by UNDP and assistance is
also expected from the United Kingdom. The credit would have a term of
10 years, including 5 years of grace, and would subsequently be refinanced
under any loan or credit which the Bank Group may make to help finance the
wood processing project itself.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report, "Recent Economic Developments and Prospects of
Malawi" (67a-MAI), was distributed to the Executive Directors on April 17,
1973 (R73-77). Country data are provided in Annex I. An updating
economic mission visited Malawi recently. Its report is under preparation.
3.        Since independence, in 1964, Malawi's economy has grown by an
annual average of just over 7 percent. However, with a per capita
income of only about $90, Malawi remains one of the poorest countries in
the world, and is included in the United Nations list of 25 least developed
countries. Natural resources are limited to moderately fertile soils,
substantial water resources and a climate favorable to crop production.
Although bauxite and coal deposits have been discovered, their exploitation
has not yet been found commercially viable. Forests, which cover about
23 percent of Malawi, constitute the main essentially unused resource
which could be exploited on a significant scale in the near future.
4.        The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture and is, therefore,
subject to annual fluctuations in output. Thus, while real GDP dropped
in 1968, it rose by 13 percent in 1971 and by 7.7 percent in 1972.
Only 10 percent of the economically active population is in modern sector
wage employment, but their average earnings are about five times those
of traditional farmers. Government policy is oriented towards rapid
growth of agricultural production and, indeed, real per capita farm income
has risen faster during the last two years than income in the non-
agricultural sector.
5.        A substantial savings and investment effort and generally efficient
management of the economy have contributed to economic growth. At
Independence, domestic savings were negligible and gross domestic invest-
ment was only 8.7 percent of GDP. By 1972, domestic savings had increased
to 9 percent of GDP and gross domestic investment to 20 percent, leaving a re-
source gap of US$48 million. A significant improvement in the financial



- 2 -
position of the Governmaent bas contributed to this impressive rise in savings.
At Independence, the Government was alle to finance only about half of re-
current expenditure from local resources, the deficit being met by grants and
loans from the U.K. Between 1964 and 1972, however, improvements in tax
administration and some changes in the tax system caused domestic revenue
to rise annually by 16 percent, in comparison with an average increa3e in
recurrent expenditure of only 8 percent. Consequently, the deficit on the
recurrent budget has diminished steadily - a trend which is expected to
continue.
6.        The Government has increased development expenditures at an annual
average rate of 25 percent over the last five years, and has laid heavy em-
phasis on infrastructure and agriculture. Infrastructure investments have in-
cluded the construction and improvement of roads, particularly those opening
up the central and northern regions, and the construction of a rail link to
Nacala, in Mozambique, completed in 1970, which has provided a second outlet
to the sea, supplementing the existing railway to Beira. Since 1969, the
construction of a new capital at Lilongwe has taken up about 10 percent of
the Government's annual development budget. After 1968, several large-scale
agricultural schemes, including the provision of credit to small scale farmers
and the supply of inputs, marketing facilities and some basic infrastructure,
have also been started near Salima (with German aid) and near Lilongwe, Chik-
wawa and Karonga (with IDA credits). Approximately one-fifth of total Govern-
ment investment has been in agriculture. However, greater emphasis is now
being placed on this sector, and one-third of the US$76 million public invest-
ment program over the next two years will be devoted to agricultural develop-
ment. One of the Government's major objectives is to raise the productivity
of small farmers.
7.        Total investment was US$92 million in 1972 and is expected to
grow by over 7 percent per annum through 1980. Private investments are ex-
pected to equal those of the public sector, with approximately one-tenth of
private investment in the non-monetary sector. The projected level of
private capital formation shows that private sources are expected
to continue to play an important role in Malawi's economic development. Out-
side agriculture, domestic private capital tends to be concentrated in small
enterprises, mainly in rural trade and transport. Large scale business is
still dominated by foreign-owned companies which have found a favorable
investment climate in Malawi.
8.        In view of both of the Government's present economic policy and the
maturing of past investments, an annual economic growth rate of about 6 per-
cent seems likely in the 1970s. Much of this will occur in the agricultural
sector, as a result of increased production of export crops such as tobacco,
tea and cotton. Small but growing surpluses of maize, pulses, groundnuts,
cassava and sugar are also anticipated. Malawi's agricultural exports, which
increased, in constant 1973 prices, at an average rate of nearly 14 percent
during the last three years, and which stood at about $70 million in 1973,
are projected to rise by an average of over 6 percent annually until 1980.



- 3 -
However, despite the anticipated growth of: exports, it is likely that the
country's import requirements will, as in recent years, grow even more
rapidly. In 1972, for example, the deficiL on goods and services was
US$45 million, slightly higher than in 197i. Capital inflow has been
adequate, however, to finance this deficit.
9.        The sustained improvement in the mobilization of domestic resources
for economic development is likely to continue during the rest of the decade.
Public savings, which have been negative in the past, should in the future make
a positive contribution to investment. In 1972, Malawi financed 47 percent
of its investment from domestic resources; this proportion should grow to
about 60 percent by the end of the decade. The external capital require-
ments will, however, continue to be in excess of the foreign exchange com-
ponent of projects and external aid should, therefore, also cover a substan-
tial portion of local costs.
10.       At the end of 1972, Malawi's external public debt totalled $231
million, of which $173 million had been disbursed. Debt service in that
year amounted to $6.5 million, or about 8 percent of export earnings. As
Malawi's need for external capital is expected to increase in the next few
years, the Government is determined to minimize borrowing on hard terms.
Even if future debt is obtained at rates as favorable as those of the past,
the debt service burden is likely to increase and the debt service ratio may
reach about 15 percent by the end of the decade. In view of its low per
capita income and the possibility of fluctuating future export earnings,
Malawi should continue to receive substantial amounts of external assistance
on concessionary terms.
11.       The full impact of recent petroleum price increases on the economy
has not yet been fully assessed. Malawi imports only refined petroleum pro-
ducts, and relies on hydro power for electricity generation, using oil
principally for transport purposes. Overall, it seems unlikely that the
country will suffer heavily and the increase in import values resulting
from the increased price of petroleuim products should raise the resource
gap by no more than $3.5 million, or about 6 percent, in 1974.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.       Malawi has to date received ten IDA credits 1/ totalling US$64.6
million. Five of these, representing $34 million or almost 53 percent, have
been for agriculture. The other credits have been for highways ($11.5 mil-
lion), education ($6.3 million) and power ($12.8 million). There have been
no Bank loans or IFC investments. Annex II contains a summary statement of
IDA credits as of April 30, 1974 and notes on the execution of on-going
projects. Project execution is generally satisfactory.
1/   Credit No. S-2-MAI of US$0.49 million, for highway engineering, which
was made in 1967, has since been refinanced.



13.       In 1972, IDA!s share in Ealawi's total external debt was about 20
percent, while servicing of the IDA credits accounted for only 2.8 percent
of total debt service. For 1977, these figures are projected at 21 and 4
percent, respectively, assuming a moderate growth in IDA lending.
14.       Prospective Bank Group operations in Malawi will continue to focus
primarily on rural development.   An agricultural sector mission visited Malawi
in April, 1973 to review with the Government its strategy for agricultural
development.  The report, "Agricultural Sector Review, Malawi" (235a-MAI)
was distributed to the Executive Directors on January 14, 1974 (R74-9). In
accordance with recommendations in the report, several projects are being
prepared, including the next stage of the Lilongwe Rural Development project,
which is currently under appraisal. The tovernment has also requested
assistance in the preparation of a national rural development program.
In the transportation sector, tthe Bank has been acting as executing
agency for a UNDP-financed detailed engineering study of two main roads,
from Lilongwe westwards to Mchinji and from Lilongwe north to Mzimba.
The first road will be constructed with assistance from USAID. Financing
for construction of the second road has been requested from IDA, and
this project has been appraised recently. A water supply project for
the city of Blantyre, for which the Government intends to request IDA
financing, Is also being prepared, with assistance from the United
Kingdom.  Finally, discussions have taken place with the Government
recently on their future plans for the education sector. This
may well lead to the identification of a second education project for
IDA consideration.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
15.       Malawi's economy is predominantly agricultural.   In 1972, agri-
culture contributed 51 percent to GDP and manufacturing only about 15 per-
cent. However, the manufacturing sector has grown rapidly since 1964 when
it contributed only 8 percent to GDP. At the time of Independence in 1964,
manufacturing in Malawi was limited to the processing of agricultural products,
such as tea, tobacco, maize and fish. After 1964, import substitution indus-
tries producing consumer goods for the local market were quickly established.
At the same time existing processing industries were expanded and new ones
were added, most: notably for cotton and sugar.
16.       By now, most of the obvious possibilities for import substitution
have been exploited. Further industrial growth will depend mostly on
the performance of the agricultural sector. In this respect, there is
scope for developing export-oriented processing industries since many
agricultural products are currently being exported in raw or semi-
processed form. The Government's agricultural policies aim at further in-
creases in the cultivation of export crops, such as sugar and tobacco, which
would provide an expanded supply of raw materials for processing industries.
Manufacturing is expected to continue to grow at 10 percent annually.



- 5 -
17.       Large-scale industrial development has so far been hindered by the
lack of economically exploitable natural resources. There are some coal
deposits in the north but the distance from potential markets has so far made
it impossible to envisage their coihmercial exploitation. Relatively large
bauxite deposits have also been ditcovered at Mulanje, but export of bauxite
would face transport disadvantages and production of aluminum would only be
warranted if power could be obtained at a cost which would permit competi-
tive pricing of the end-product. This is currently under investigation.
Forestry is, therefore, the only practicable source of raw material which
might be utilized in the near future for large scale export-oriented
industrial development. As of 1972, forest plantations, which are
virtually all government-owned, amounted to 38,000 ha, of which 15,000
had been earmarked for timber production and 23,000 for pulpwood production.
Although production of sawn timber has grown rapidly in recent years,
Malawi is still a net importer of wood and wood products; it is hoped
that self-sufficiency will be reached by 1980, at least for construction
timber.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
18.       The idea of creating a forest resource on the Viphya Plateau, in
the Northern Region of Malawi, for an eventual pulp and/or timber industry
took shape in the 1960s. Tests carrie] out at that time showed that this
area presents ideal ecological conditions for §rowing p{yes capable of pro-
ducing average annual net yields of 15 to 20 m   per ha.-   Planting began on
a large scale in 1964, with technical and financial assistance from the United
Kingdom which, through ODA, has since provided about Ei million for the
Viphya project. Planting reached a peak of nearly 6,000 ha in 1968, but was
discontinued in 1970 when depressed world market prospects for pulp and paper
cast doubts on the viability of pulp production in Malawi and consequently
planting in excess of requirements for a possible timber industry did not
seem warranted. By that time, 24,000 ha of pine had been planted in
Viphya.
19.       In 1970/71, however, a market study financed by the UNDP (with the
Bank as Executing Agency) showed encouraging prospects and led to UNDP
financing of a pre-feasibility study of the possible use of the Viphya forest
resources. In 1972, the Bank, as Executing Agency with FAO advising, re-
tained Messrs. Jaakko Poyry and Co., of Finland, as consultants to assess
the viability and scope of a possible project, and to suggest infrastruc-
ture requirements, product mix and tentative construction schedules and
start-up dates. Having considered over twenty alternatives in the course
of their study, the consultants concluded, in July, 1973, that the produc-
tion of woodpulp for export constituted the best possible use of the Viphya
1/   Similar growth rates are obtained in parts of the South USA, Chile
and New Zealand; but by contrast coni erous forests in the Nordic
countries only grow between 2 and 8 m per ha per year.

resources and that such a project would show a satisfactory economic
return. The study also concluded that, if it proved impossible to set
tup a pulp export scheme, saw-milling would constitute a viable, though
economically somewhat less attractive, alternative. On the basis of the
study, the Government decided to attempt to arrange for the establishment
of a pulpmill for export with a capacity of 150,000 tons per year and 1978
as the target start-up date.
20.       The Malawi authorities recognized, however, that additional
pre-investment investigations are necessary, particularly on the following
matters:
(a) fuel and power requirements, and sources of supply;
(b) transport requirements from the forest area to the mill
and from the mill to the markets;
(c) hydrological and soil investigations to ascertain the
suitability of the proposed mill and harbor sites on
the shore of Lake Malawi;
(d) environmental control;
(e) wood extraction methods;
(f) detailed forest inventory; and
(g) training requirements for local staff.
The Government also recognizes that the necessary financing, management and
marketing arrangements would require the involvement of experienced
foreign partners who could provide part of the financing, provide management
and technical assistance and assist in the marketing of pulp. At this
stage, the precise form the ultimate arrangements would take is uncertain
but, in view of the magnitude of the investment involved (possibly close
to US$200 million) the Government is attempting to find partners who
will take equity participations in the project and has approached various
interested groups.  In the meantime, the planting program, suspended in
1970, was resumed to ensure an adequate future supply of wood for the
plant.
21.       The Government approached UNDP, ODA and the Bank Group for
assistance in carrying out the additional investigations required,
resuming the planting program and obtaining the expertise (administrative,
technical, financial, commercial and legal) necessary to promote the
proiect, seek partners and negotiate with them.   In December 1973, the
Government established the Viphya Pulp and Paper Corporation Ltd. (VIPCOR),
in order to: (a) coordinate and control the various preparation activities
and (b) identify prospective partners and negotiate the necessary contracts
with them. At the same time the Government completed the investigations
required to ascertain the suitability of the proposed mill and harbor
site on the basis of which the Government and the Association agreed
that Chinteche, on Lake Malawi, would be the most suitable site. From
Chinteche, the pulp would be transported by barge to Chipoka at the
southern end of the lake and from there by rail to the ocean port of
Nacala in Mozambique.



- 7 -
22.       At present, market prospects for pulp, especially for long fibre
pulp, are excellent and projections of future prices are favorable. More-
over, the Viphya area is ideally suited for producing wood of the quality
required. According to present estimates, the cost of the wood delivered
to the mill would be less than $10 per m , which is substantially lower
than that achieved in most woodpulp producing countries. Furthermore, the
fact that 24,000 ha have already been planted would give the Viphya scheme
a headstart of several years over nost other schemes in Africa and Latin
America currently under investigation.
23.       On the other hand, the distance of the forest area and proposed mill
site from ocean ports and the relatively complex transportation system that
the scheme would require, constitute serious handicaps. In addition, until
arrangements are completed with outside partners regarding the construction
and operation of the plant, and until long-term arrangements are made for the
sale of its output, it will not be possible to pass final judgment on the
scheme's financial or economic viability.
24.       To enable project preparation to proceed without delay and at
the same time to minimize the amount of possibly unfruitful expenditures,
it was agreed by all parties concerned that the financing of further project
preparation should include those activities designed to help Malawi (a) to
promote the project, secure partners and negotiate contracts with them;
(b) to determine the financial and economic advantages that would accrue
to Malawi under the arrangements proposed by the partners; and (c) to
execute those studies that would be of use regardless of the type of
industrial plant to be constructed (e.g. identification and engineering
of the road network required for the transport of logs from the forests
to the mill site, engineering of the transportation system from the
mill to the markets). The same approach is being followed with respect
to the afforestation program which has been resumed. Similarly, discussions
currently under way with ODA contemplate continuation of the forest planting
program for two years - a program which would be justified even if it
became necessary to settle for the saw milling alternative rather than the
woodpulp project.
25.       The total costs of project preparation, including the planting
program, have been estimated at about $6.4 million (with about $1.9
million representing local currency expenditures). By agreements dated
October 8, 1973 and January 30, 1974, UNDP has already agreed to make
available a total of US$1,167,500 to finance engineering of the mill and
various studies and investigations (other than for transportation) and
to provide part of the technical expertise required to promote the
project, identify partners and negotiate suitable agreements with them.
The planting program for 1974-1976 requires a total of $2.4 million, of
which $1.4 million is in foreign exchange. Assistance in financing of
the planting program is expected to be provided by the United Kingdom.
These arrangements leave a shortfall of about $2.0 million to finance
the foreign exchange cost of transport planning and engineering and of
technical assistance to VIPCOR additional to that provided by UNDP;
the Government has requested IDA assistance in this amount. A breakdown
of the estimated costs and proposed sources of financing is presented in
Annex III.



-8-
The Proposed IDA Credit
26.       IDA financing would be limited to the foreign exchange cost of
planning and engineering of the transportation aspects of the scheme and
to the provision of technical expertise to enable the Government to identify
partners and negotiate with them. Technical expertise financed by IDA would
include services for which no provision is made in the UNDP grant as well
as, if needed, a continuation of the services financed by UNDP after the
UNDP grant has been exhausted. A credit and project summary is presented
as Annex III.
27.       With respect to transport, the IDA credit would provide financing
to permit: (a) determination of the road system and engineering of
specific roads required for the transport of logs from the. forests to
the mill, including preparation of bidding documents for the construction works
involved; and (b) planning and engineering of the system required to
transport the pulp from the mill to the markets as well as preparation
of the bidding documents for the facilities required and such transport
equipment, including rolling stock, as may be necessary. Engineering will
only concern transport facilities within Malawi but the consultants will
also review the existing system beyond Chipoka to confirm its adequacy and,
if need be, suggest improvements and to ascertain the incidence of the
transport costs concerned. The duration of these studies is estimated
at two years and the foreign exchange costs involved would be about $1.3
million. In addition, the proposed Credit includes an allocation of
$415,000 to finance the financial, technical, administrative, legal and
commercial expertise (other than that available from UNDP) needed by
Malawi to promote the scheme and negotiate the partnership arrangements.
A modest allocation ($55,000) is also included for the purchase of some
office equipment.
28.       Although the transport and engineering studies to be financed
under the credit are not expected to take longer than two years and
although Malawi has already begun discussions with prospective partners
and is doing so in close consultation with the Bank Group, it may not
be possible for Malawi to succeed in concluding acceptable arrangements
with these partners in such a short time. The closing date of the proposed
credit has therefore been set at June 30, 1978.
Execution of the Project
29.       The project will be executed by VIPCOR.   Consultants and experts
to be financed under the proposed credit would be selected in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines. Disbursements from the credit account would be
limited to the foreign exchange expenditures involved, local expenditures
being met by the Government.
Terms of the Proposed Credit
30.       In accordance with the usual practice for project preparation
credits, the proposed credit would have a term of ten years, including a
grace period of five years, and would be refinanced through any loan or
credit that the Bank Group might later make for the construction of the
plant itself or of the required infrastructure.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Credit No. 102-MAI - Education: $6.3 million credit of May 4, 1967; Closing
Date June 30, 1977
The project consists of the construction and equipping of one
national primary teacher training college and the provision of technical
instruction facilities in 12 secondary schools. The project has been im-
plemented satisfactorily and school premises have been in use for over a
year. At the request of the Government, the Closing Date was first extended
from the original date of December 31, 1972 to June 30, 1973 to allow dis-
bursement for the completion of construction of the college, which was de-
layed by a change in site. A second extension, to March 29, 1974, was agreed
to allow disbursement for installation of electricity in the secondary school
to Dedza. A request from the Government to use savings under the credit,
amounting to about US$420,000, for the construction of a post and telecom-
munications school was agreed to by the Executive Directors on December 4,
1973. The closing date has consequently been further postponed to June 30,
1977. Implementation of the telecommunications school is progressing
satisfactorily.
Credit No. 244-MAI - Agriculture - Lilongwe Development Project Phase II;
$7.3 million credit of May 13, 1971; Closing date March 31, 1976:
This project is designed to add approximately 375,000 acres to
the 500,000 acres developed under the Phase I Project. Physical execution
of the project is progressing most satisfactorily. However, the staffing
of senior posts continues to give some concern and stocking of the
cattle ranch is behind schedule.
Credit No. 282-MAI - Agriculture - Karonga Development Project: $6.6 million
credit of January 26, 1971; Closing Date December 31, 1977:
The project is the first phase of an agricultural development
program for the Karonga area. It includes development of irrigated rice
cultivation, dry-land crop production, livestock development, extension
services, credit, health services and the rehabilitation of freight service
cz La--e MaI:lWi. After some initial delays project implementation is now
progressing satisfactorily. Cost overruns are expected on the improvement
of the lake ports involved, due to lack of experience with marine works
in Malawi, remoteness of the northern terminal and basic material price
increases. The latter also affects the cost of civil works under the
agricultural component. Construction of the southern terminal has been delayed
by eight months, mainly because further soil investigations were required.
Note: These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to rem-
edy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II

Credit No.363-MAI - Agriculture - Shire Valley Development Project Phase II;
$10.5 million credit of March 28, 1973; Closing Date December 31, 1978:
The project is a continuation and expansion of the program completed
under Phase I and includes, in addition to extension services, credit and
marketing facilities, a livestock component, health facilities, :fisheries
development, feeder road construction, research on irrigated and rainfed
crops, land registration and wildlife protection. Project execution is
satisfactory.
Credit No.426-MAI - Second Power Project; $7.5 million Credit of
September 7, 1973; Closing Date December 31, 2978:
The project provides part of Malawi's power generation development
program for the period 1973-1977 and consists of: (a) the construction
of a barrage and 20 MW hydroelectric power station at Tedzani, as an ex-
tension to the station financed under Credit 178-MAI; (b) the installation
of a 12 MW gas turbine, to be constructed at Blantyre; and (c) a tariff
study. The project is being financed jointly with CDC which will lend
up to US$6.1 million equivalent. As a result of recent world-wide increases
in prices, cost overruns of about $5.2 million over the original estimate
of $14.3 million are anticipated and the Government is considering
measures to meet additional financing requirements and/or to reduce the
1973-77 development program. In spite of the cost overruns the project
remains the best choice among the various alternatives to meet projected
power demand.

MALAWI - PULP PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower                  Republic of Malawi
Amount                    US$2 million equivalent
Terms                     Repayable in 10 years including 5 years of
grace through semi-annual installments at a
service charge of 3/4 of 1 percent per annum.
Project Description       The project is the next preparatory step of
the Borrower's program to develop and prepare
a wood processing scheme based on the forest
resourc3s of the Viphya plateau. A pre-
feasibiLity study, financed by UNDP and exe-
cuted by IBRD, concluded that the establishment
of a pulpmill at Chinteche would be the most
economical alternative. More detailed studies
on cost and engineering of various aspects of
the scheme are, however, required. In addi-
tion, technical assistance will be required to
enable Malawi to identify and secure financial,
technical, and commercial partners to carry out
the scheme. A preparation program has been
drawn up jointly between the Government, UNDP,
FAO, the United Kingdom and IDA, who would
participate in financing and executing this
program.

assist in financing the forestry programs
required. The IDA credit would finance the
foreign cost of consultants' services for
transport planning and design and adminis-
trative, commercial, engineering and legal
services required to promote the scheme and
negotiate with partners.
