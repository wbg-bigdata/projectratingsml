MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND
DEVELOPMENT AND THF INTERNATIONAL DEvELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA FOR A DALIAN PORT PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan and
credit to the People's Republic of China for $96 million eqiivalent,
comprising a bank loan of $71.0 million equivalent and an IDA credit of SDR
18.2 million ($25.0 milliion equivalent), is submitted for approval. The
proposed loan would be for 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate; the credit would be on standard IDA terms
with 35 years maturity.
2.         Background.  The transport system in China has been severely taxed
by the pace of recent economic development and capacity constraints are
evident in all modes. China needs to sutstantially expand its port and
waterway facilities to relieve the growing hindrance to external trade caused
by inadequate berth capacity and container handl.ng capability. China's
Seventh five-Year Plan (1986-90) recognizes these needs. Substantial
investments are envisioned: these includte technological improvements such as
container handling facilities and intermodal transport centers. ro facilitate
these improvements, significant institutional changes are being carried out in
the sector, including an extension of the policy of separating the functions
of Government from those of operating enterprises, and delegating greater
authority to local managements. The Bank fully subscribes to Governmenz's
objectives for development of the transport sector and is supporting its
initiatives with both financial and technical assistance. Three ports
prcjects (Loans 2207-CHA, 2689-CHA, and Huangpu port project, approved by the
Board on October 6, 1987) will effect improvements at the ports of Tianjin,
Shanghai and Huangpu.
3.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Expanding the capacity of coastal
ports is an urgent objective for the Government, and this is being tackled in
two ways. First, new facilities are to be constructed (120 new deep water
berths are envi ioned in the Seventh Five-Year Plan), and second, the equip-
ment of existing facilities is to be updated to obtain greater productivity.
The Bank has supported and will conrinue to support these objectives. With
Bank assistance the Government has added port facilities, enhanced container
handling capability and other specialized facilities appropriate to modern
traffic, initiated new organizational arrangements designed to improve the
productivity and efficiency of port operations, and trained a large number of
perscns in long term planning. The Dalian project is a logical next step in
this program of financial, technical and institutional cooperation.
4.         Project objectives.  The proposed project is designed to improve
Dalian port s administration and enlarge its capacity to handle cargo flow.
The project wo.ld:  (a) assist the urgent expansion of port capacity;
(b) facilitate technology transfer in long term planning (master planning),



- 2 -
nlnciai planning and control, and berth management; (c) facilitate the study
or the present and potential use of containers in the hinterland of Dalian to
secure adequate coordination of transportation and storage facilities; and
(d) support the training needs of port operators, maintenance personnel and
managers at Dalian.
5.        Project Description.  The proposed project consists of:  (a) con-
struction of 2 container berths for 30,000 DWT ships and 2 general-purpose
berths for 25,000 DWT ships capable of conversion to container berths as and
when needed. These berths will require: (i) construction of 1 1,840 m-long
breakwater and revetment; (ii) dredging of about 2.5 million m of soil,
backfill and stabilization of the fill material; (iii) construction of the
necessary railway and road connections. container freight stations, ware-
houses, and storage yards; (iv) installation of water supply, sewerage and
power supply systems; (v) provision of the required loading/unloading
equipment, navigational aids, harbor operations equipment and boats; and
(vi) construction of required maintenance buildings, auxiliary buildings and
others; (b) training of port operators and other specialists in the Port of
Dalian Authority (PDA) through technical assistance in the areas of: (i) oort
operations, design, planning ana construction supervision; and (ii) financial
control, including in particular capital e:tpenditure planning and control and
operating cost monitoring; (c) preparation of a study of intermodal transport
of containers in the port hinterland to reduce port congestion; (d) review and
updating of the port master plan which is under preparation by the eaff of
PDA. Construction of the railway and highway connections outside the port
area started early in 1986 and is the responsibility of the Minist:;' of
Railways (MR) and Dalian Municipality, respectively. The implementation of
;he remaining components of the proposed project falls under the responsibil-
ity of PDA under the overall supervision of MOC Capital Construction Depart-
ment. Assistance will be prcvided by the Waterway Design Institute, foreign
consultants and China National Technical Import Corporation as appropriate.
The project, to be carried out over 5 years, provides funds for civil works;
cargo handling equipment; training; and technical assistance.  The total cost
of the project is estimated at US$230.6 million equivalent, with & foreign
exchange component of US$96.0 million.  A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shcwn in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operatiors in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Civil works
and equipment installation are expected to be completed by the end of 1992. A
map is attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, dated January 5, 1988, is
attached.
6.        Agreed Actions.  The Government has agreed to:  (a) onlend the
proceeds of the Bank loan and IDA credit to PDA on terms and conditions satis-
factory to the Bank Group; and (b) ensure that the road and railway connection
from the new port facilities to the main Dalian-Shenyang highway and railway
will be open to traffic on completion of the project. PDA has agreed to:
(a) submit to the Bank Group its audited financial statements not later than
six months after the end of each financial year; (b) carry out: (i) the
training in accordance with a program to be agreed with the Bank Group;
(ii) the updating of the port master plan on the basis of Lerms of reference



agreed with the Bank Group, and complete it by June 30, 1989; and (iii) the
containerization study on the basis of terms of reference agreed with the
Bank, complete it by December 31, 1989 (the Gcvernment has also agreed to take
the necessary steps to impler,,ent the recommendations of this study); and
(c) conduct its tinancial affairs so as to cover all its costs of operation
(including depreciation) from operating revenue, and to meet from internally
generated funds all its financial obligations including debt service,
remittances to the state and allocations to special funds and to prepare
annually, beginning in 1989, a rolling financial plan covering the following
five years.
7.         Justification and Risks.  In 1985 the average waiting time of ships
arriving at Chire~se coastal ports was over 11 days, costing about Y 187,000
per ship.  Economic benefits of the proposed project derive from:  ti) ship
time savings; (ii) cargo handling cost savings (iii) cargo time savings. On
this basis, the economic rate of return of the project is 20x. The only risks
foreseen for the project are of delays in construction attributable to
domestic procedures fur civil works international competitive bidding.
8.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association
and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan and
credit.

/a  As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR
credit balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the
dollar and the SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a
dollar amount greater than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
