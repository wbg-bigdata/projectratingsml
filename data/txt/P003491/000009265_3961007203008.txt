SUBJECT:            Project Completion Report on China
Dalian Port Project (Loan 2907-CHAlCredit 1875-CHA)
Attached is the Project Completion Report on China - Dalian Port Project (Loan 2907-
CHA/Credit 1875-CHA) prepared by East Asia and Pacific Regional Office with Part H contributed
by the Borrower. The US$71 million Loan and US$25 million Credit were approved in February
1984, and closed on December 31, 1993, on schedule. US$750,000 were canceled.
Dalian Port, the second largest port in China serves the northeast provinces of the country
and part of Inner Mongolia. The port was congested and operations hampered by the lack of modern
equipment. The project had as main objectives to increase port capacity by construction of container
berths; to facilitate technology transfer in master planning, financial planning and control, and in
research and design; and address the training needs of port operators, maintenance staff and
managers.
The PCR, which is satisfactory, contains an adequate description of project processing,
execution and results. Changes were introduced in project items during execution. Both the
Borrower and the Bank showed the necessary flexibility. Physical works were satisfactorily completed,
except for a rail link between the new container terminals and the main rail network. Its completion
is delayed by the lack of coordination between different government agencies having different
priorities and investment programs. This issue was underestimated at appraisal. The total cost of the
project was lower than projected and the reestimated rate of return higher. Except for the non-
completion of the railway link, all covenants were complied with. The relatively modest institutional
objectives of the project were reached. Extensive training was carried out, reaching twice as many
staff as planned. Finances of Dalian Port are sound, but the trend is not favorable, operating costs
being high and the presentation of the revenue account unclear.
The outcome of the project is rated as satisfactory, its institutional development as modest
and its sustainability of its benefits as likely.
The project may be audited together with the Tian Jin Port Project (Ln 2689-CHA) and the
Huang Pu Port Project (Loan 2877-CHA) after they are completed.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
DALIAN PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 2907-CHA/CREDIT 1875-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the project completion report (PCR) for the Dalian Port Project in China for
which loan 2907-CHA and credit 1875-CHA in the amounts of $71 million and SDR 18.2
million, respectively, were approved on February 9, 1988. The loan and credit were closed on
December 31, 1993, as originally planned. Final disbursements were made on April 28, 1994.
The credit was fully disbursed; however, $750,507.53 of the loan will have to be cancelled.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Transport Operations Division, China and
Mongolia Department of the East Asia and Pacific Region of the Bank (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III), and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started just before the project closing date and it is based,
inter alia, on the staff appraisal report, loan agreement, development credit agreement, project
agreement, supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal
Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
DALIAN PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 2907-CHA/CREDIT 1875-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMIVARY
Objectives
1.            The project's principal objective was to assist the Government of the People's
Republic of China (GOC) to relieve congestion in the port of Dalian and increase its handling
capacity by providing additional facilities and improving the planning, managerial and
operational capabilities of its staff.
Implementation Experience
2.             The project became effective on October 3, 1988, four months after the loan
and credit agreements were signed. The project launch was quick and smooth with major
contracts in civil works awarded shortly after loan/credit effectiveness.  The components
financed by the loan/credit were completed satisfactorily on schedule by December 31, 1993,
despite additional works such as (a) a modification of the breakwater to accommodate a bulk
grain vessel, (b) repair of typhoon damage to the breakwater, (c) the construction of a
multipurpose warehouse at a later stage, and (d) procurement of additional container handling
equipment.
3.             Overall project implementation was satisfactory, mainly due to its lack of
complexity. The Bank-financed components were implemented by a single executing entity, the
Dalian Port Authority (DPA); coordination was simplified, and decision-making was fast.
However, the civil works contracts took longer than expected because the breakwater was
damaged by a typhoon and its structural design was modified so it could be converted to a grain
terminal at a later stage. Procurement of some major equipment was unnecessarily protracted
due to a lack of familiarity with the Bank's procurement guidelines. Nevertheless, these delays
were rectified during implementation, and the project was completed in the time frame originally
planned.
4.             Lack of coordination among the Government organizations, however, was a
significant obstacle for the locally-financed railway link to the port, as it delayed construction



by about two years. At issue was the fact that the Ministry of Railways (MOR) was responsible
for railways outside the port area, and coordination among it, DPA and the Ministry of
Communications (MOC) was difficult. It was only the Bank's persistence that caused the State
Planning Commission (SPC) to intercede.
5.             The Bank's procurement procedure, in particular ICB, was new for DPA; the
Bank insisted the Borrower strictly follow the evaluation and postqualification criteria provided
in bid documents. Thus, final evaluations of the bids for the procurement of rubber-tired gantry
cranes were delayed. However, this practice has since been successfully applied and delays
minimized.
Results
6.             The major objective of the project was achieved. It provided multipurpose and
container berths that considerably expanded the port's capacity. Its institutional goals were also
achieved substantially, through technical assistance: DPA's capacity to carry out developmental
planning (master planning and financial planning), to manage its facilities, and to undertake
research and design activities was enhanced.  The project's benefits were also achieved,
including savings in (a) cargo-handling costs, (b) ship waiting and berthing time, and (c) cargo
time. The ERR on the project as completed is estimated at 26.7% against the 19.9 % in the SAR
(paras. 6.15-16).
7.             DPA's financial performance was satisfactory: The average annual growth rate
of net revenue and net profit after taxes are higher than in the SAR (para. 6.7). Under present
financial arrangements, the port enjoys a healthy range of liquidity, leverage, and profitability
(para. 6.13).
Sustainability
8.             The project is sustainable. It provided new port facilities outside the town
center (which has serious traffic congestion) and port traffic will grow even more, in conjunction
with the economic development of the Dalian area as well as the country. Further, DPA is a
financially stable entity with adequate financial resources to maintain and operate the port
efficiently. Moreover, with the modern equipment and extensive training provided under the
project, DPA has the potential to increase the port's productivity even further and provide
services at competitive costs.
Findings and Lessons Learned
9.             The findings and lessons from the implementation of the project are:



- iv -
(a)   While DPA  was quite capable of implementing project components within its
immediate control, those outside its jurisdiction, where coordination and cooperation
with other agencies were involved, proved to be beyond its capacity.
(b)   Lack of coordination between government agencies was the result of the agencies
having different priorities vis-a-vis the investment programs (paras. 5.3(a) and 6.3).
(c)   The investment priorities of a port, where the economic impact of its operatioil will
primarily be regional, may differ from those of a national carrier, such as the railway.
Often, the investment is an insignificant item for the latter, although it may be highly
important to the former.
(d)   Based on these lessons, future port projects should be designed so the implementation
of works could be executed by one entity or, if this is not possible, by those under the
same ministry. However, it may be difficult to design multi-modal projects that would
conform to this goal.
(e)   During implementation, priorities may change, requiring the investment package
financed by the loan to be modified. This is particularly true in an economic
environment like China where rapid growth is taking place. Thus, both the Bank and
Borrower's approach to implementation were flexible enough to respond to changes
positively and rapidly (para. 5.3(b)).
(f)    Greater attention should be paid to familiarize the Borrower's project implementation
staff with the Bank's procurement and disbursement guidelines before project
execution begins (para. 5.6). Thus, a project launch seminar is quite valuable, as was
confirmed by the delay in implementing this project.

2. Background
2.1           Along with energy, transportation is recognized as one of the critical areas of
investment to support continued economic growth in China. Based on its experience in the port
sector, the Bank identified several important deficiencies, including (a) insufficient berths, (b)
an inadequate number of experienced port operators and managers, (c) deficient long-term
planning and coordination (including intermodal aspects) among the various authorities, and (d)
the lack of modem technology to address technical problems.
2.2           In 1986, the GOC reorganized the port subsector so as to obtain greater
productivity and faster development through increasing port autonomy and accountability. In so
doing, it separated policy-making from operational functions. As a result, the latter were
devolved to self-accounting port authorities with adequate financial and operational autonomy
to manage their day-to-day affairs.
2.3           Dalian port, built in 1899, is the second largest among the 15 major coastal
ports in China. Its economic hinterland includes the three northeast provinces (Liaoning, Jilin,
and Heilongjiang), and four large districts in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia; no other deep
water sea ports serve these areas. Other ports in the area are at Yinkou (at the mouth of the



- 2 -
Liaohe river) and Dandong (at the mouth of the Yalu River); but, both are estuarine ports with
only limited depth.
2.4           In 1985, Dalian's traffic reached 44 million tons, of which 77% was foreign
trade. The major commodities handled were crude oil and petroleum products (45% and 15%
of the traffic, respectively) at specialized terminals. The remaining commodities were grain
(12%), chemical fertilizers (2%), which were largely bulk items and 11.4 million tons of break
bulk cargo, including iron and steel. During the year, total traffic exceeded the port's design
capacity of some 36 million tons, which resulted in an average of 40 ships each day waiting for
berths. As the average ship cost Y 16,000/day in the port, the annual waiting cost was over Y
230 million. Moreover, traffic has been projected to double over the next decade, because a
special economic zone (SEZ) was being built north of Dalian city, the government was
emphasizing foreign trade and it was highly likely that coastal shipping would increase. Thus,
Dalian port needed to be expanded.
2.5            To meet the expansion, a new site had to be found. The main operating
districts of Dalian port were constrained by the encroachment of urban development and could
not be further enlarged. Various sites around Dalian Bay were investigated before Dayao Bay
was selected, because its water depth was suitable and it was located near the recently built
crude oil terminal and adjacent to the SEZ.
3.      Project Objectives and Description
Project Objectives
3.1            The objectives of the proposed project were to increase Dalian port's capacity
to handle cargo flow and improve its operational procedures. The project would (a) expand
China's port capacity, which was in danger of constraining economic growth; (b) facilitate
technology transfer in areas such as long-term planning (master planning), financial planning and
control, and berth management; (c) support MOC's research and design capabilities; (d) support
the study of the present and potential use of containers in areas around Dalian to ensure adequate
coordination of transportation and storage facilities; and (e) address the training needs of port
operators, maintenance personnel and managers.
Project Description
3.2           The project included the following components:
(a)   Two container berths for 30,000 dwt ships and two general purpose berths for 25,000
dwt ships that could be converted to container berths when needed. These berths
would require the construction of (i) a 1,840m- long breakwater and shore protection
works; (ii) two container freight stations; (iii) a railway, roads, warehouses, and



-3-
storage yards, where needed; (iv) a railway line from the in-port rail line of Dayaowan
to the Jin-xian marshalling yard, and an access road from Dayaowan to the Shen-da
freeway; and (v) the required maintenance and auxiliary buildings. It would also
require (vi) the dredging of about 2.5 million m3 of soil and backfill and stabilizing
the fill material, (vii) installing water supply, sewerage and power supply systems, and
(viii) providing equipment needed for loading/unloading and harbor operations as well
as navigational aids and boats.
(b)   Training of port operators and other specialists through technical assistance in (i) port
operations, design, planning and construction supervision; and (ii) financial control,
particularly of capital expenditures and operating costs.
(c)   A study of intermodal transport of containers in the Dalian hinterland to reduce the
port's congestion.
(d)   A review and update of the port master plan which was being prepared by DPA staff.
4.      Project Design and Organization
4.1            In the 1980s, ports in China suffered serious congestion due to a deficiency in
port capacity. Thus, the project would provide new facilities and improve efficiency. In this
context, the design parameters and criteria for project design were straightforward and well
understood by the parties concerned, which included MOC and DPA. Consequently, the project
was adequately and efficiently prepared by DPA and foreign consultants.
4.2            Project preparation by the Bank took about one year. The first Bank mission
was sent in October 1985; the project was appraised on November 12, 1986.
4.3            The project was to be the first phase of the new port development at Dayao
Bay. Given the range of facilities required, the complexity of coordinating the survey, design
and site preparation and the constraints of the site, the implementation plan was well designed
and construction was well executed. Also, the scope and size of the project was not overly
ambitious.
4.4            A great degree of flexibility in the execution of the works financed by the
Bank/IDA was required to ensure that the project content kept apace with to changing priorities
imposed by the ongoing economic reforms. This flexibility was only possible because the works
were executed by one executing agency (DPA). Simple project organization contributed to the
project's success.



- 4-
5.      Project Inplementation
5.1           The project was implemented satisfactorily within the scheduled completion
date: It became effective on October 3, 1988, about four months after the legal documents were
signed on July 15, 1988. Prequalification of bidders, preparation of bid documents, as well as
bid evaluation for civil works contracts, were undertaken prior to loan/credit effectiveness.
5.2           Construction of civil works was managed by DPA's Construction Command,
a self-accounting unit that reported directly to the agency director, with assistance from foreign
consultants.
5.3           The completed project deviated from the SAR in these respects:
(a)   Construction of the railway link to the port was delayed. This was part of the project,
but locally financed. The delay was due to poor coordination between MOR and
MOC/DPA. Bank supervision missions repeatedly urged GOC through SPC to resolve
difficulties between the concerned entities. It appeared that the MOR, which was
responsible for part of new railway line, had other priorities and did not consider the
new line of sufficient importance to its operations to include it early on in its
investment program. In fact, agreement to execute the works was only reached in late
1990. Thus, the link is now being constructed by both MOC and DPA and should be
completed by October 1995, nearly two years after the project's closing date. The
delay causes economic losses during the period when no railway link is available to
provide containers with direct rail transportation.  Thus, until it is completed,
unloaded containers will have to be transshipped by barges to the old terminal where
a railway link exists.
(b)   The breakwater design was modified to incorporate the development of a grain
terminal in the new port. This was a good example of the close coordination between
the Borrower and the Bank. Before the project, this terminal was to be located at the
existing port area near Dalian city. DPA decided to include it in the Dayao Bay
project at the time the master plan was prepared and requested Bank approval to
modify the breakwater and multipurpose berths (in the Bank-financed project) to
accommodate bulk grain vessels. The Bank agreed and it meant the breakwater could
accommodate an 80,000 dwt grain vessel; however, it required that the breakwater be
widened and deepened, at a cost of Y 28.2 million. About the same time, a "Grain
Distribution and Marketing Project" under the Ministry of Commerce was being
prepared. Several joint meetings were attended by the Borrower and Bank's transport
and agriculture divisions and it was agreed that part of the new port facilities should
be converted into a grain terminal. This facility is an integral part of the Grain
Distribution and Marketing Project (Loan 3624/Credit 2518-CHA) which the Bank
approved on June 17, 1993.



(c)   The Bank financed the procurement of additional cargo-handling equipment (three
units of front-lift container-handling cranes) to meet increased container traffic.
(d)   The Bank financed the construction of a multipurpose warehouse which was originally
planned to be locally financed.
Lesson: Flexibility in implementation, which allowed appropriate changes to be made to project
design, was possible because of close coordination between the Bank and the Borrower.
5.4           When the breakwater was being constructed, a few caissons which were not
yet secured by stonefill were displaced by a typhoon (in September 1992). This cause a slight
delay in the completion and a marginal increase in the contract price (Y 1.4 million).
5.5           The Bank has maintained a close relationship with Japan's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund (OECF). MOC/DPA had expressed a desire to use OECF funds for a phase
II project after the Bank-financed phase I is completed. At present, the OECF and GOC are
negotiating the second phase and asking for the Bank's opinion.
5.6           Procurement. There were no major procurement problems. However, there
was some delay in the procurement of rubber-tired gantry cranes due to the Borrower's lack of
familiarity with Bank procurement procedures, and a lack of clarity about the commercial
relation between China and the Republic of China. This was because the Borrower applied
evaluation factors that were not specifically provided for in bid documents. This lead to several
months' correspondence before the lowest responsive bidder was awarded the contract.
6.      Project Results
6.1           All project objectives were achieved during the implementation of the project;
however, there were several minor modifications to the use of loan/credit:
(a)   The breakwater was modified to accommodate bulk grain vessels and grain unloaders;
(b)   Additional equipment for container handling was procured;
(c)   Cost savings were used to finance the construction of a multipurpose warehouse which
originally was planned to be financed locally.
6.2            Final project cost is estimated at $242 million against $231 million estimated
at the time of appraisal. The final cost will only be known when the construction of the railway
link will be completed in October 1995. The cost of civil works increased slightly due to the
breakwater modification and additional container equipment.
6.3           All project components were completed by December 31, 1993, except for the
construction of the railway link to the port (a locally-financed component). This contrasts with



- 6 -
the agreements required at the time of loan negotiations, which stipulated that GOC would
ensure that all road and railway connections would be completed before the port component was
completed. The agreement between MOR and MOC/DPA to begin construction works was only
concluded in late 1990, about two and half years late. It is fortunate that the economic loss due
to this delay was not critical to the success of the project (see economic evaluation); however,
if it had been completed on time, it would have contributed to the benefit stream by an estimated
$4.6 million per annum.
Lesson: Coordination between ministries and government agencies takes time and can be
problematic.
6.4            During project implementation, no environmental or resettlement problems
arose.
Financial Performance
6.5           Decentralization.  While the project was prepared in 1986, the port's
management and financial administration was decentralized from the State (MOC) to local
municipal government.  In turn, the municipality delegated its responsibilities to the port
authority, which handles day-to-day management, operation, construction and development of
the port. However, major projects and plans affecting the long-term development of the port
still need the approval of the State Council through MOC, although the port bears the financial
obligations for its own development. To avoid burdening the municipal government, the
finances of the port were restructured by the annual lump sum payment. This enhanced the
port's internal cash generation by reducing, in 1986, a five-year fixed tax obligation to the
Government. To date, this advantageous arrangement is still in effect.
6.6            The port's decentralization had a significant impact on its financial and
management structure. The following table summarizes the key financial terms of the port's
managerial and financial restructuring, as well as the size of the projects that require State
approval.

annual lump sum payment
of Y 5.27 million until the
end of 1990. This payment
was reduced to 3.56 million
for the period 1991-95.
6.7            Past Performance. The financial performance of the port for the last eight
years, through the construction period which ended in 1993, was satisfactory. When the actual
measured costs included in the PCR for 1985-92 are compared with the projection in the SAR,
the PCR figures show a higher-than-expected average annual growth of net revenue (16.8% per
annum in the PCR versus 8.9% per annum in the SAR). However, the increase in gross
revenue was offset by (a) the high growth rate of operating costs (30.4% per annum in PCR
versus 11.4% per annum in the SAR), and (b) the large increase in nonoperating expenses and
wage bonuses. Net profit after taxes shown in the PCR is Y 226.8 million, which is slightly less
than the estimated net profit of Y 244.2 million provided in the SAR.
6.8            The total volume of traffic handled by the port during this period was not very
different from the level forecast at appraisal (52 million tons in the SAR versus 52.1 million tons
in the PCR); the small difference can be attributed to changes in the port's operating costs and
charges. The SAR forecasts were developed at a time when the country had a policy of
controlling prices for almost every major commodity at the State level, and, as a result, cost
increases and inflation were rare.  In addition, the State handled the allocation of major
resources during the previous three decades and only charged users the "planned" prices.
Therefore, the financial forecasts presented in the appraisal assumed that (a) port charges would
remain virtually constant; and (b) the rate of inflation would be minor (in the range of 4.5%-
6.5% from 1985-92). These assumptions, although reasonable at the time, proved unrealistic
due to a much higher-than-expected cost-pushed inflation.
6.9            Between 1985-92, although port tariffs were still controlled by the State, they
increased by 16.8% per annum. However, this increase does not match the rapid increase in



unit operating costs, of 30.4% a year. Highlights of the port's actual income and cost summaries
are shown below compared with the forecasts in the SAR. No SAR forecast was provided for
1993, but the actual financial results given by the port for 1993 are reported in Table 1.

6.10           DPA's financial performance has not been as good as was expected during the
appraisal: Operating ratios continued to deteriorate and were substantially higher than the
appraisal targets. This trend was caused by rapid increases in costs and no matching hikes in
tariffs, despite supervision mission reminders.
6.11           The rate of return on net fixed assets, while generally satisfactory, also declined
from 32% in 1985 to 14% in 1992 and 8% in 1993. This was due to cost increases and the fact
that fixed assets were not revalued. However, it should be noted that, due to the mission's
concern, DPA revalued them in 1993. This will help DPA accumulate depreciation reserves at
a faster rate to replace the retired assets. It is encouraging to note that, following MOF's
instructions, DPA adopted a new accounting system based on international accounting standards,
effective July 1, 1993, that will adopt commercial practices and improve the financial
management information system.
6.12           Present Performance. Despite the rapid increase in operating costs, the port's
current financial position was still sound at the end of 1993: Current assets substantially
exceeded current liabilities. Also, the port's actual current ratio in 1992 was 2.7 (1.1 for 1993),
which is not substantially different from the SAR original forecast of 2.9. In addition, the
percentage of net current assets in the form of cash did not change much--from 35.8% in 1985
to 34.7% in 1993. The salient points of the port's balance sheet during these years are listed
in Table 2.

6.13           Future Performance. Under present financial arrangements, despite the high
increase in operating costs, the port still enjoys a healthy range of liquidity, leverage, and
profitability due to its flat lump sum payments to the State (these were reduced once in the last
eight years, in 1991). The port's new responsibility for financing its own capital programs has
not yet had an impact on its cash flow (Table 3), but it is expected to weigh more heavily in the
future. In addition, the preferential tax terms granted by the State, which are set to expire in
1995, could change at any time after that. Therefore, to maintain the current favorable terms,



- 11 -
the port's financial personnel should test many scenarios and alternatives before negotiating with
State officials.
Economic Reevaluation
6.14           The economic analysis in this report is based on a reevaluation of the data on
traffic, operational performance, economic costs and benefits of project components as compared
to the estimates provided by the SAR. The methodology used was similar to that in the SAR and
can be briefly summarized as follows: (a) capital investment and maintenance costs were revised
to reflect 1994 prices and included in the cost stream; (b) the benefits stream, also reflected in
1994 prices, was also included, and consists of savings in port handling, ship port time (berth
and waiting), and cargo port time (berth and waiting); and (c) a project life of 20 years was
assumed and the capital investment period for all project items is from 1987 to the end of 1995
(including the railway link to the port). Benefits started to accrue both for general cargo berths
and container berths in 1994. The estimated economic loss caused by the delay in the railway
link was $0.5 million/year, which is less than 1 % the project's total annual benefit and
considered insignificant.
6.15           When reviewing the port components altogether, it was found that three major
factors improve the reevaluated economic rate of return (REIRR): (a) an increase in the average
daily ship cost in port, (b) a reduction in capital construction costs in terms of constant prices,
and (c) higher-than-expected general cargo and container traffic. Conversely, these factors are
offset by decreasing cargo value and benefit in container handling.
6.16           Assessing these revised data, the overall EIRR for this project is 26.7%, which
is higher than the SAR estimate of 19.9% (see Annex 1 for a detailed analysis).
6.17           The REIRR and SAR estimates of the project in terms of economic rate of
return, sensitivity analysis and net present value (NPV) are given below:

- 12 -
7.       Project Sustainability
7.1            The project is sustainable: DPA is financially sound and with a sharply growing
economy in China and the Dalian city area (including SEZ, which is next to the port) being
located in the center of a major industrial area, the port traffic is expected to continue growing.
DPA is vigorously responding to market forces including seeking joint ventures with foreign
investors to develop and improve services in the port. There is no known factor that will negate
the sustainability of the project.
8.       Bank Performance
8. 1           The Bank's performance in identifying issues and preparing the project has been
good and quick. It was identified in October 1985 and appraised in November 1986. Bank staff
resources leading to appraisal were 82.8 staff-weeks and supervision was also efficient. The
annual average input of staff resources was 11.5 staff-weeks for the life of the project. Also,
sectoral coordination within the Bank was good.
8.2            The Bank took a consistent position when it came to procurement and providing
appropriate instructions and guidance, when necessary. A good example was with regard to the
procurement of rubber-tired gantry cranes. After this procurement was finalized, no major
confusion or delays were experienced.
9.       Borrower Performance
9.1            In  general, the Borrower's performance  was good  and  preparation,
implementation, and supervision were adequate, as was staff deployment.  DPA  has an
experienced autonomous department to implement the project's physical aspects and an
appropriate number of sufficiently experienced staff were made available.
9.2             The Borrower's capability in long-term financial planning, budgeting accounting
and costing, for which technical assistance was provided, was strengthened and will be tested
after the project is completed.
9.3            As shown in Table 7, Part III, covenants were mostly met. Some delays were
experienced with submitting the reports in the master plan and intermodal study; this was due
to the delay in internal authorization. Tlhe internal procedures should be improved.
9.4             The Borrower will need to closely monitor the operation of the new container
terminal, with its advanced systems of managing information and equipment; however, DPA's
performance in this area has not been proven.



- 13 -
10.     Project Relationship
10.1           The working relationship between Borrower and Bank was satisfactory during
the preparation and implementation period. The Bank's contribution in terms of advice and
guidance was accepted in a positive manner and this resulted to the timely completion of a well-
rounded project.
11.     Consultant Services
11.1           Foreign consultants were engaged to help DPA supervise construction. In
general, the GOC was reluctant to hire them for Bank projects, because of their cost and their
limited capacity to access local information. Thus, they were not employed for the studies
designed under project; consequently, DPA financed the studies with domestic funds. However,
this arrangement could have limited the scope of work and extensiveness of the study (although
this is not yet conclusive).
12.     Training
12.1           Extensive training was carried out. Under the project, 3,167 staff were trained,
against the 1,620 targeted in the SAR. In particular, training for management was satisfactorily
completed (631 staff compared with the 269 expected in the SAR). Overseas training, however,
fell short, at 340 staff-months for 192 staff against 500 staff-months for 112. The shortfall has
been supplemented by additional domestic training that was acceptable, since the quality of local
training is satisfactory.
13.     Project Docunmentation and Data
13.1           The legal documents for loan 2907-CHA/credit 1875-CHA were adequate and
appropriate for achieving project objectives in the key organizational and financial areas. The
project appraisal report provided a useful framework for both the Borrower and the Bank during
project implementation. DPA promptly provided sufficient data and clarifications for the PCR,
which helped facilitate its early completion.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S
PERSPECTIVE
Section A
1.            Dayao Bay Project of Dalian Port is a major project in the seventh five-year
plan in China which was reviewed and formally accepted by the State Acceptance Committee
at the beginning of 1993. The new port was officially operational and opened to traffic on July
1, 1993. The acceptance committee commented on the project's general layout, handling
technology and structure type design as being reasonable with sound quality; environmental
protection, fire-fighting facilities complied with design requirements and relevant state
regulations; the project completion files and documents were basically completed, precise and
systematic and complied with acceptance requirements; the handling equipment was provided,
operational organization established, operations staff met the capabilities required.
2.             The completion of this project enables the Port of Dalian to have a set of
modernized and formalized containers, multipurpose berths with top level of facilities, equipment
and management systems in China. It can accommodate container ship of the third generation
and is open to liners from Asia, Europe and America, etc. It provides a solid foundation for
the development of the Dayao Bay Port area as a transfer hub port with deepwater. When the
port operates at its design capacity, it will be of major significance for greatly raising container
transport capacity within Dalian Port and Northeast region to promote hinterland economic
expansion and especially the development of Dalian Economic and Technical Zone. It also
played an important role in relieving the restrictions within the existing port.
3.             For construction of the project, it imported large amounts of advanced port
equipment with modern container operation management systems; trained a lot of technical,
operational, maintenance and management staff and especially overseas training that enabled
trainees to widen their view, learn and obtain some international, advanced technology and
management experiences which would be a great benefit to the Dalian Port to become an
international modern port.
4.            In the project execution period, the Dalian Port Master Plan was drafted and
some necessary revisions were made according to study prepared for container inland
distribution. These were all done by Chinese technical staff themselves. We believe that the
study results are of great significance and comply with Chinese conditions.
5.             By the execution of Dalian Dayao Bay Project, the construction and
management level of Dalian Port had greatly raised, especially as a big step in international
construction of supervision in the procurement aspect.  An amount of technical and
administrative staff now possess rich professional knowledge, management experiences, familiar
with international construction supervision, ICB procurement and the World Bank procurement
guidelines.



- 15 -
6.             Particular attention was given to environmental protection. There were no
significant effects to the local environment after the project completion in the case of large
excavations, backfilling, dredging and other construction.
7.             Success of the Project Management. The Dalian Port Authority established
a project management system gradually after the project appraisal and set up a dedicated
organization in charge of overall management. The smooth completion of the project fully
showed that the organization and management of Dalian Port Project were completed
successfully, effectively and satisfactorily.
8.             The project design was basically undertaken by the Chinese design institute,
i.e., the Water Transportation Design and Planning Institute of MOC. In general, the design
was a success. The design institute made a great effort to ensure the satisfactory execution of
the project including preparation of bidding documents and site construction design revision, etc.
9.             In accordance with the change of the port master plan and development needs
in the project period, the breakwater was modified to accommodate 80,000 dwt bulk grain
vessels (to import wheat), by utilizing the Bank's saving of the loan. The advantage of
deepwater at Dayao Bay was fully taken. In addition, the Bank loan and savings were used to
construct a multipurpose warehouse, purchasing an additional three units of container front
loaders.  All those items purchased outside the Bank's loan were finished before the
disbursement deadline.
Section B
10.            The first part of the PCR drafted by the World Bank is comprehensive. It
describes completely all the major items of the project executed and the analysis provided is
mainly correct and complies with the actual conditions.
11.            With respect to the data of each item in the list of the PCR, Part III, we
acknowledge that they are correct and fully show the overall situation.
12.            With regard to the delay in procurement, the main reason was that so many
bidders had bid for the works, the bidding document requested two different delivery methods,
i.e., CIF and turnkey items technology are complicated and confirmation of the bidder's
experience and subcontracting background, caused the additional time for bid evaluation.
Section C
13.            During the whole implementation period, the World Bank was very positive,
serious, effective, and due to these fruitful efforts enabled the project to be completed according
to schedule. The Dalian Port Authority appreciates all officers and experts from the World Bank
who participated in this project for their efforts day and night, and their contribution made to



- 16 -
the port development. It gave us deep impressions of their strong sense of responsibility and
spirit of job respect.
14.            From the project appraisal to reimbursement deadline, we have been keeping
a close cooperative and mutual respect with the technical Division, Communication Division,
Disbursement Division, etc., of the Bank. This is the first time that Dalian Port has used a Bank
loan. Due to mutual efforts, especially in guidance on all aspects granted by the Bank's experts,
the Dalian Port became familiar with relevant rules rapidly and overcame all difficulties on
technical, commercial, financial application and other project executions, and completed the
project satisfactorily.
15.            Each site supervision mission from the World Bank made a significant effect
on the project execution. They inspected the site situation on time, and collected first-hand
information, resolved problems in the construction to accelerate the construction procedure by
strengthening a mutual understanding and trust so that an easy understanding can be reached.
Especially, the Bank's mission gave us great support and assistance on breakwater modification,
loan and savings application and civil works price adjustment, etc., and also direct shopping
limitation adjustments, and LCB for purchasing some listed shopping equipment, etc. The Bank
officers' instruction, understanding and quick responses to our request facilitated implementation.
16.            Two or three years after the appraisal of the project, the cost of equipment
increased considerably. This additional cost was absorbed by the cost savings in civil works
contracts resulted from the devaluation of renminbi.
Section D
17.            Generally, the project implementation can be kept to strictly follow the mutual
agreement and use the loan according to the Bank's guideline and requirement.
18.            In order to have a sound implementation of the Dayao Bay Project, the Port
of Dalian carried out comprehensive training to relevant staff including the senior project
management staff training at the Bank, local procurement and disbursement training, invited
foreign consulting company for construction supervision and financial training. Training has
been carried out, for example, by visiting overseas and investigating domestic major projects of
the Bank such as the Lubuge Power Station and the East Pier Project of Taijing Port to ensure
that managers possess the basic relevant experience and knowledge.
19.            In all stages of the project execution, a positive close relationship was
maintained with the World Bank, full attention to the Bank's instructions and followed the rules
seriously. Therefore, no major problems occurred in the execution period.
20.            For the key railway link construction, the Chinese government confirmed that
the construction should be undertaken by MOR in 1986 and in the same year, a major reform

began to the Chinese railway construction systems. The problem of investment had occurred
as this was a special line servicing the port and it contradicted with the new systems. By several
coordinations made by SPL and the Bank's attention, the railway was confirmed to be built by
MOC and MOR in 1992 and estimated to be finished in 1995. Due to the delay in completion
time, Dayao Bay Port cannot be fully efficient in the first two years.
21.            Some delays caused in the project execution are mainly due to too many
approvals, too long a preparation time for ICB, lack of experience for bid evaluation and some
other reasons such as limited power authorization, etc.
22.            Use of foreign consultants to supervise civil works contracts created a favorable
environment among the supervision teams; they trained and worked with the Chinese supervision
team for preparing detailed monthly reports. There are still some weak points that exist, such
as some inadequate supervision and lack of equipment.t; thus, some inspections had to rely on
the social services, etc.
Repayment Ability
23.            Since November 1, 1993, the Dayao Project entered the repayment period; the
Port of Dalian needs to annually pay US$8.5 million as retuming the capital and interest
accordingly. As in recent years, local exchange rates had big changed, i.e., from 2.80:1 up to
8.72:1. It is really giving heavier repayment load to the project executor and the adjustment of
port tariff rate is limited by the state policy regulations. The loss caused by the exchange rate
change cannot be recovered. The Port of the Dalian Authority recommended that relevant state
authorities pay attention to this matter.

DALIAN PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 2907-CHA/CREDIT 1875-CHA)
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. TRAFFIc
1.            As shown in Table 1.1, the overall traffic of the port is increasing steadily.
Actual traffic performance, during 1990-93, was almost the same as the SAR forecast in terms
of total port traffic. However, general cargo and container traffic were higher than the SAR's
estimates and are summarized as follows.
TRAFIC HANDLED BY DPA
(million tons)
Forecast (SAR)                      Actual (PCR)
Total    General    Container      Total    General    Container
Year        traffic    cargo      ('000 teu)    traffic    cargo     ('000 teu)
1990       48.4        8.3         175          45.3       10.3        167
1991       50.2        8.7         191          49.6       12.3        206
1992       52.0        9.0         209          52.1       13.7        256
1993       52.8        9.4         228          52.9       15.3        285
2.             Despite the severe economic recession suffered in 1989 and 1990, the average
annual traffic growth of the port during 1985-92 still shows a increase of 3.7 percent per annum,
compared to an estimated 3.6 percent in the SAR. Based on the economic activities of the area
(a newly developed Special Economic Zone is located adjacent to the project site), the port
traffic forecast figure for the next decade (1995-2005) is estimated to be approximately
12 percent higher than the SAR, and 5 percent higher thereafter to 2010 (Table 1.1).
3.             General Cargo Traffic. Traffic performance is higher than the SAR estimate.
For the last three years (1990-93), the actual traffic handled by the port was on average
46 percent higher than the SAR estimate. The port needed the additional general cargo berths
to meet the general cargo traffic demand. In 1993, DPA commenced construction of phase two



- 30 -                              ANNEX 1
of the Dayao Bay project. Phase two includes the building of six additional general cargo
berths, financed by OECF Japan, adjacent to the two Bank-financed berths.
4.             Container Traffic. The actual container traffic of the port, between 1990-93,
was 13 percent higher than the SAR estimate. The growth of the container penetration ratio,
however, is concentrated only on foreign trade, particularly foreign incoming traffic, which
increased from  20 percent in 1985 to 66 percent in 1993.  For domestic cargo, the
containerization ratio decreased sharply from the overall 8 percent in 1985 to only 1 percent in
1993. While foreign-going container traffic increased substantially, the share of domestic
container traffic also shrunk sharply from 32 percent of total container traffic in 1985 to the
negligible 5 percent in 1993.  The actual container penetration ratio of the port can be
summarized as follows:
ACTUAL CONTAINER PENETRATION RATIo IN DALuAN PORT
(%)
1985                       1993
In     Out      Total      In     Out       Total
Foreign going                  20       4           7     66       12         17
Domestic going                 10       7           8      2        1           1
Domestic sharing                -        -        32        -        -         5
5.             The rapid growth of foreign incoming containerized cargo represents the current
cargo handling trend for international sea transport. Today many international ports only accept
containerized cargo, and this requirement will force the port to expedite the containerization of
its foreign outgoing traffic. The development of domestic container transport has fallen behind
due to the lack of adequate investment in transport facilities for the domestic users. Since
improvement of domestic container handling will involve very large sums of capital, including
the participation of many agencies (port, road, highway, bridge, electric power, tracking
industry, management information systems, etc.), it is estimated that progress in this area will
be rather slow in the foreseeable future.
B. SHIP TIME ANALYSIS
6.             General Cargo Carriers. Comparing 1985 and 1993, general cargo carriers
spend an average of 10.2 days and 6.9 days, respectively, in the port, of which the ship waiting
time in the port (nonproductive time plus weather stoppage) accounted for 7.3 days and 4.2
days, respectively. During the same period, thie average working time per ship (productive time
at berth) has decreased from 2.9 days to 2.1 days due to the improvement in the handling
efficiency of the port. Despite the higher traffic demand, the decrease in ship waiting time from
5.5 days to 1.3 days reflected that had the added capacity provided by the project not had taken
place, the increase in ship waiting time would have been much larger (Table 1.2).

7.             Container Ships. The port does not have separate records for container ships
until 1990. During the last three years (1990-93), berth operation (productive time at berth) and
the overall port operation (total average port days per ship have shown improvements in the
handling of containers with the number of the ships visiting the port almost doubling (Table 1.2).
C. BERTH OPERATIONS
8.             The operating parameters for general cargo and container berths at the port
also differ from the SAR estimates. Detail parameters used for the economic reevaluation of
each project berth are shown in Table 1.3 and highlighted as follows:

D. ECONOMIC CosTS AND BENFiTS
Economic Costs
9.             All costs necessary for the completion of the facilities planned under the project
have been taken into account in the economic reevaluation of the project. However, certain
costs incurred in the construction of the breakwater area for the grain terminal, railway
construction outside the port, and channel dredging which will also facilitate construction of the
next phase, have been completely or partially omitted, as this cost also related to other separate
projects of which benefits cannot be quantified under this project. All inputs and outputs have
been evaluated in constant 1994 economic costs (Table 1.4).  Financial costs have been
converted to economic costs by shadow pricing each berth's input categories. Conversion factors
for each input category are based on estimates determined in completed Bank studies.
10.           The overall conversion factor is 0.96, of which 0.95 is for general cargo berths
and 0.98 is for container berths. The factors derived for the various cost items have been
applied to the annual project expenditures to obtain the stream of project economic costs (Table
1.5).
11.           In the PCR, the shadowed economic project costs, at 1994 prices, are 14.5
percent higher than financial costs, and total economic costs of the project are 15.2 percent
lower then the SAR estimate at constant 1987 prices.

Economic Benefits
12.            The economic analysis primarily focussed on the benefits derived from relieving
congestion in the port. Details of the traffic forecast are shown in Table 1.1. The project will
yield quantifiable benefits in the form of savings in cargo handling coats, ship time (both waiting
time and operating time), and cargo time (Table 1.6).
13.            Savings in Cargo Handling Cost. Savings, although relatively small, are
expected in the direct cost of cargo handling in the new facilities as compared with the present
facilities at the port. Without the project, the only way to handle traffic in excess of available
berth capacity would be through more costly lighterage. It is estimated that the lightening costs
would be 3 to 4 times greater than normal handling costs. Detailed estimates of handling cost
savings are shown in Table 1.7. Lighterage has been assumed for cargo tonnage in excess of
berth capacity at 95 percent occupancy, at a cost three times that of normal handling.
Substantial savings in handling costs are expected after the renovation of existing berths, and at
the proposed berths. Savings in handling costs have been converted to economic benefits by
shadow pricing the main cost components of normal handling and of lightening. Conversion
factors of 1.05 for berth handling and 1.1 for lightening are used; these factors were estimated
in a previous Bank study.
14.            Savings in Ship Time. Savings in ship time include both reductions in ship
time waiting for berths and working at berths due to improved cargo handling. Estimates of
savings in ship waiting time resulting from the project are shown in Table 1.8. Ship costs used
for the economic evaluation are at the low end of the ship cost model developed by the Bank.
The annualized ship resale value, plus operating costs, has been used to calculate project
benefits. The annual resale value of ships has been assumed to reflect the present state of the
shipping industry, and gives a slightly lower return than the annualized replacement value of
ships.
15.            Savings in Cargo Time. Savings in ship cargo time also apply to the interest
saved on the value of the cargo. For domestic cargo, the marginal source of working capital
would be loans from the People's Construction Bank of China at 8-9 percent interest. For
foreign cargo, the higher foreign exchange working capital needed would require more foreign
borrowing, and it is assumed that this would be at China's marginal cost of capital of
approximately 12 percent. Roughly 40 percent of all cargo passing through Dalian port concerns
domestic trade. Interest savings have, therefore, been calculated assuming an average rate of
interest of 11.0 percent per annum.
16.            Total project benefits for the items discussed above are presented by year in
Table 1.8. The major project benefit would be in ship-time savings. These savings would
accrue first to ship owners and could be passed on to cargo owners. As for general cargo and
container traffic, the vast majority of ships calling at Dalian are either Chinese-owned (COSCO)
or Chinese-operated; it is expected that 90 percent of the project benefits for such traffic will
also accrue to China directly.

/_ 1. Figures in the table are the costs for normal berth handling. If cargo traffic exceeds 95% ber:h
occupancy rate, additional cargo will be handled by lightering at roughly three times the costs for
normal berth handling.
For lightering operations, throughput capacity is taken as 50% of normal berth throughput capacity.
/_2: Without project, one existing general cargo berth will be converted to container berth in 1990 due to the
congestion of container traffic.
With project, two existing general cargo berths, currently used as a container berth, will be converted
back to general cargo berths in 1991 due to the completion of two proposed container berths.

/_: Includes large berths operation only.
/2: Traffic would exceed the practical capacity of these berths. ror the purpose of the economic evaluation it has been
assumed that ways will be fourd, e.g., thrcugh lightering, to move the traffic through the port with waiting trIns
not exceeding those correspording to 95% berth occupancy rate.

(iv)  waiting time queuing factors are from  Port Development, UNC-AD 1978, and Berth throughput, UNCTAD, 1978
(v) annual ship waiting days . annual ship berth required x waiting time queueing factors.
/1. Includes foreign (in/out), loaded and empty containers.
/2. Traffic would exceed the practical capacity of these berths.  For the purpose of the economic evaluation it has been
assumed that ways will be found, e.g., through lightering, to move the traffic through the port with waiting times
not exceeding chose corresponding to 955 berth occupancy rate.
