REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO PREDUZECE VODOVOD I KANALIZACIJA SARAJEVO
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE SOCIALIST FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
equivalent to US$45 million to Preduzece Vodovod i Kanalizacija Sarajevo
(Sarajevo Water Supply and Sewerage Enterprise, or Vodovod) with the guarantee
of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, to help finance a water sup-
ply and sewerage project. The loan would have a term of 25 years, including
five years of grace. Interest would be 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A basic economic mission visited Yugoslavia in November 1972; its
report entitled "The Economic Development of Yugoslavia" (194a-YU) was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on January 2, 1974. An updating Economic
Memorandum (662a-YU) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 23,
1975. An economic mission visited Yugoslavia in October 1975 and the find-
ings of this mission are incorporated in this report. Basic data on the
economy are given in Annex I.
Economic Trends and Development Issues
3.        The Yugoslav economy has experienced rapid growth during the last
two decades, with total GDP at constant prices having increased by an average
rate of 6.3 percent, and per capita GDP at 5.2 percent annually. In 1973,
per capita ,GNP came to about US$1010 (World Bank Atlas methodology). This
impressive record of growth was accompanied by some fundamental structural
changes in the economy which has moved towards a modern industry/service
oriented urban society. The share of agriculture in GDP declined from 38 to
20 percent while the share of industry and mining increased from 16 to 37
percent.
4.        The population growth rate averaged 1 percent per year during the
last two decades, but with considerable regional variations ranging from an
average rate of 1.6 percent for the less developed Republics and Provinces to
0.7 percent for the developed ones. The structural changes in the economy
permitted a sizeable transfer of labor force from agriculture to industry and
services. However, by 1974 nearly 45 percent of the resident active labor
force was still engaged in agriculture and forestry, mostly on small private
farms; industry (including mining) accounted for 21 percent, and other sectors
for 34 percent.

5.        The socio-political framework evolved through several constitution-
al amendments which were consolidated in the new constitution of 1974. It
strengthens three important features of the socio-political system of
Yugoslavia. First, self-management, whereby the use and control of the
socially owned means of production is entrusted to the workers' collectives,
is the fundamental right and obligation of every "basic organization of as-
sociated labor" (the smallest technologically identifiable unit of operation)
in every sector and activity. Second, the responsibility for most important
social and policy decisions has been shifted from the Federation down to the
Republics and Provinces, and on to the communes. And third, the management
and financial responsibility for social activities (like health, education,
welfare, etc.) is transferred from the realm of the state to "communities of
interest" (decision-making bodies which comprise delegates of both suppliers
and users of the specific services). Responsibility for certain economic
activities affecting large segments of the society (like communal services,
power production, highways and water management) can be - and progressively
is - similarly organized through communities of interest.
6.        The social sector, which includes government, most enterprises and
public institutions such as libraries, hospitals, theatres and schools, has
the leading role in economic and social development; it accounts for 85 per-
cent of GDP and employs over half of the total labor force. The private sector
is predominantly comprised of peasant farms (with a 10 hectare limit to land
holdings) and small enterprises (with a 5 person limit on the number of non-
family workers), mainly in handicrafts, construction, trade, transport and
tourism. In the past, the private sector had been relatively neglected by
government policy. However, lately more attention is being devoted to pri-
vate farmers with a view to accelerating the growth of agricultural produc-
tion and reducing the rural/urban income disparity.
7.        Regional income disparity - with a gradient of per capita income fall-
ing generally from North to South - has emerged as one of the most important
development issues of the country. Four distinct regions can be distinguished
by stage of development. The Republic of Slovenia is the high income region
with almost double the national average. The Republics of Serbia and Croatia
and the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina make up the middle income regions,
ranging from 100 to 125 percent of the national average; however, even within
these regions pockets of underdevelopment persist.    The Republics of Bosnia-
Herzegovina, Montenegro and Macedonia - with per capita income between 67
to 75 percent constitute the upper group among the officially designated "less
developed regions". The Autonomous Province of Kosovo, with an average in-
come of only 33 percent of the national average, is at the bottom of the spread.
These inter-regional disparities can be traced back further to intra-regional
disparities. Within Republics and Provinces the spread between communes can
extend over the range of 10 to 1, and it is the prevalence of stagnating poor
rural communes within the less developed regions which largely determines the
disparity between the regions. The rate of economic growth of the less devel-
oped regions as a whole was only slightly below the average for Yugoslavia, but



due to the faster population growth (1.6 percent per year versus 0.7 percent
in the more developed regions) the income disparity had tended to widen sig-
nificantly during the last two decades. In order to reverse this trend Pnd to
accelerate economic growth and social development in the less developed re-
gions, mechanisms have been instituted for sizeable transfers of financial
resources. In 1973, credits on highly favorable terms (containing a grant
element of around 50 percent) were made available through the "Federal Fund"
to the less developed regions in the amount of almost US$250 million, equiv-
alent to more than 20 percent of their total investment in the social sector.
An additional US$130 million for social services were transferred as budgetary
grants. Both categories of transfers have been growing since in line with the
growth in total GDP.
8.        Open unemployment has not been a serious problem and is estimated
to be only around 3-4 percent of the resident labor force in 1974. However,
this low rate conceals three important aspects of the employment problem.
First, an estimated one million out of a total labor force of around 9 million
(in 1974) has assumed temporary employment abroad. Second, there is some
evidence of growing regional and occupational imbalances, due to low inter-
regional mobility of labor and to unmatched skill requirements in a fast
changing economy. Third, severe underemployment persists in the private
agricultural sector.
Recent Developments
9.        In 1974, Yugoslavia recorded a rapid increase of GDP of 9 percent
in real terms as compared to 5 percent and 4 percent in 1973 and 1972 respec-
tively. Industry was the leading sector with an estimated growth rate of 11
percent in 1974; however, the growth of agricultural production, enhanced by
favorable weather conditions, and of services (with the exception of tourism)
also accelerated during the year. This rapid expansion of economic activity
permeated the whole economy. Investment outlays grew in nominal terms by
almost 40 percent (9 percent in real terms) and total consumption expenditures
by about 41 percent (13 percent in real terms). The resulting rapid increase
in total demand for goods and services was reflected both in the rise of em-
ployment and of imports - both in nominal and real terms - and domestic prices.
The gain in total employment amounted to about 5 percent in 1974 and exceeded
for the first time the natural increase of the labor force. Industrial pro-
ducer prices rose by almost 30 percent while the cost of living rose less
rapidly by some 21 percent. Since fiscal policy leaves, for institutional
reasons, little room for demand management, the major response to the infla-
tionary pressures was in terms of monetary policy and direct controls through
prices and income policy, including recent legislation placing greater con-
trol on investment expenditures. After an expansionary phase during 1972 and
1973, the money supply increased by only 24 percent as compared to a nominal
increase of social product of about 36 percent. The shift to a large deficit
in the balance of payments in 1974 also contributed to the increased effec-
tiveness of the monetary policy.



- 4 -
10.       The balance of trade deficit increased from US$1.7 billion in 1973
to almost US$3.7 billion in 1974 both on account of an increase in the volume
and the rapid rise in the price of imports and the stagnation of real exports
(the terms of trade for the country are estimated to have deteriorated by
about 11 percent). The recession in Western Europe has led to a sharp decline
in exports to that area. The traditionally large surplus for invisibles (mostly
from workers remittances and tourism receipts) failed to compensate for the
large trade deficit and the country recorded a current account deficit in
excess of US$1 billion in 1974 as compared to a surplus of US$464 million
in 1973. In response to the circumstances, the import regime has been grad-
ually tightened since August 1974, affecting a large variety of consumer goods
and some capital and intermediate goods. In addition, the National Bank raised
the intervention point in the foreign exchange market, in effect devaluing the
dinar by about 7 percent as against the currencies of Yugoslavia's major trading
partners. The large current account deficit has led to some loss of foreign
exchange reserves; the official reserves fell by US$345 million in 1974 (com-
pared to a gain of US$632 million in 1973). In addition, net foreign borrowing,
which averaged US$390 million during 1971-73, increased to around US$650 million
in 1974. Commercial import credits from suppliers and credits from financial
institutions continued to be the major sources of foreign capital. Long-term
funds related to financing of development are being made available mainly by
the Bank and some bilateral sources (particularly the US Export-Import Bank and
Federal Republic of Germany).. Yugoslavia has also been one of the beneficiaries
of the IMF's Special Oil Facility. Yugoslavia's medium- and long-term external
debt outstanding as of December 31, 1973 was US$4,319 million (disbursed only)
and is expected to have increased to about US$5.0 billion during 1974. Debt
service payments amounted to about 15.9 percent of foreign exchange earnings
(including workers remittances) in 1973 and 15.3 in 1974.
11.       In 1975, the growth rate of the economy is estimated to have receded
to 4.5 percent, due mainly to the combined effects of a restrictive monetary
policy, stagnating exports and a reduced growth of personal incomes; economic
investment and housing construction provided the major growth stimulus during
1975. The inflationary pressure which built up during 1974 and extended into
1975 receded drastically in the second half of the year; the rate of increase
of industrial producer prices decreased from 30 percent in 1974 to an annual
rate of 12 percent for the first ten months of 1975 and the index of real net
personal income remained unchanged for the same period.      The good harvest in
1974 has had a favorable impact on the balance of payments, although meat ex-
ports were severely affected by the European Community ban on meat imports.
Exports to oil producing countries and to the non-convertible currency area
have continued to expand rapidly in 1975, but are not expected to compensate
for the sharp decline in exports to the convertible currency area. Workers'
remittances and receipts from tourism have increased marginally. The current
account deficit for 1975 was estimated to approximate the level of 1974 on the
basis of preliminary estimates, but there are now indications that it may have
dropped by 20 to 25 percent due to a curtailment of imports and an increase in
exports during the last third of 1975.



-5-
Prospects for 1976
12.       The balance of payments is expected to remain the central problem
in 1976 as well as for the years to come. The current account deficit is ex-
pected to decline somewhat as imports are restrained and there is a recovery
in the level of economic activity in Western Europe. The inflationary momen-
tum will probably be curtailed further through improved investment control,
closer alignment of real income changes with improvements of productivity
and restrictive monetary policy. The real growth rate of GDP is expected to be
constrained to about 4.5 percent in 1976 with a gradual recovery in subsequent
years.
Medium- and Long-Term Objectives and Prospects
13.       The aggravation of major economic problems during 1974, such as
rapid inflation and balance of payments pressures, has led to a reappraisal of
development objectives. In the light of the recent shift of relative prices
in favor of raw materials, more emphasis will be given to the development of
Yugoslavia's own natural resources. In this connection, the development of
the energy sector is given the highest priority. It focuses on electric power,
where the generating capacity is likely to fall critically short of the rapidly
rising power requirements of the expanding economy. The development of the
power sector will largely be based on the large unutilized hydropower potential
and soft-coal reserves of the country. Other priority activities are ferrous
metallurgy, some segments of non-ferrous metallurgy (notably lead, zinc, copper,
nickel and bauxite/aluminum), technologically advanced production equipment,
basic chemicals including petroleum refining, agriculture and food processing,
interrepublic transportation, multipurpose works, and housing and basic con-
struction material.
14.       This emphasis on accelerated development of the raw material basis
and the deepening of the economic infrastructure requires a more capital-
intensive investment pattern, associated with longer time-lags between invest-
ment and output. To sustain this development path, both continued high bor-
rowing abroad and an increased savings rate will be essential. Since, with the
possible exception of private savings, interest rates do not play a significant
role in the determination of the level of aggregate savings, the income policy
--i.e. the guidelines governing the distribution of enterprise income between
workers' income and accumulation--will have a crucial role.
15.       The new Five Year Plan (1976-1980), presently under preparation,
will focus on the implementation of these objectives. For growth, an average
rate of 7 percent per year is proposed as feasible, comparing with a target
growth rate of the previous Plan of 7.5 percent and an expected realized
growth rate of 6.5 percent. For employment, the average planned growth rate
would come to about 3 percent with annual increments exceeding the natural
increase of the labor force by growing margins. This would permit more
vigorous pursuit of two major social objectives: the reduction of the number



- 6 -
of temporary migrants abroad, and an increased absorption of the rural under-
employment into the social sector. The economy will continue to be open to
the world market although the composition of foreign trade is expected to
change with a reduced share for raw material, semifinished products and con-
sumer goods on the import side, and an increased share for agricultural pro-
ducts and manufactured goods on the export side. Workers' remittances are not
expected to increase in real terms, but rising tourism receipts are expected
to compensate for the expected declining importance of workers' remittances.
16.       The reduction of regional disparities is another priority objective
of the new Five Year Plan. To that end, the transfer of financial resources
to the less developed regions in the form of loans at concessionary terms for
economic investment and budgetary grants for social development will be con-
tinued and probably will increase as a proportion of total GDP. Since most of
the natural resources of the country, including hydropower, are to be found in
the less-developed regions, they will, in addition to the transfers, benefit
from the increased emphasis on the development of basic industries and power
which will to a considerable degree be financed through direct financial con-
tributions from the consuming regions.
17.       The new Five Year Plan is being prepared according to the self-
management principle as stipulated by the Constitution of 1974. "Self-man-
agement planning" is perceived as an iterative process of sequential, converg-
ing consensus-finding. In the initial stage, broad priorities (as to sectors
and activities) and general quantitative targets and constraints (like growth
rates of social product and the volume of savings and investment) are deter-
mined by political consensus of the assemblies of the socio-political communi-
ties (Communes, Republics and Provinces, Federation). Subsequently, the plan-
ning process starts at the bottom with individual enterprises and communities
of interest setting out their expectations and targets. The planning process
then proeeds through successive and partially overlapping stages of horizontal
adjustments within sectors and branches (aimed primarily at eliminating gross
duplications), vertical adjustments between closely interdependent sectors and
branches (aimed at determining realistic orders of magnitudes of production,
conceptually within an input/output framework), and regional adjustments bet-
ween Republics and Provinces (aimed at both horizontal and vertical consolida-
tion). The socio-political communities participate in this process by ensur-
ing observance of the broad priorities, targets and constraints, and by re-
solving conflicts which cannot be resolved by the direct participants. The
evolving consolidated programs of action, which in their totality constitute
the operational portion of the Plan, are codified in the form of "social con-
tracts" or "self-management agreements" which are legally binding for the
whole Plan period unless renegotiated in the case of major deviations occuring
in the course of Plan implementation. The new Plan, which is currently under
preparation is, thus, expected to differ from the previous Plan in strengthen-
ing and formalizing the commitments for implementation by enterprises, banks
and government institutions.



-7-
Creditworthiness
18.       In spite of the present balance of payments problems, the prospects
for Yugoslavia's continued economic growth during the next decade are good.
The country's endowment of natural and human resources, its relatively low
dependence on imported primary energy, its pragmatic approach to economic
problems and its readiness to undertake institutional changes, combine to
give grounds for a favorable assessment of future prospects. Yugoslavia will
need to continue to raise foreign capital on a fairly large scale, mostly
from established channels such as the Euro-currency market, suppliers credits
and the World Bank. In addition, greater use may be made of credit lines
from COMECON countries and the EC, and efforts are being intensified to open
up new sources of capital in OPEC countries. Due to the size and structure
of external borrowing during 1974 and the years to come, the debt service
ratio is expected to increase from 15.3 in 1974 to 18.2 in 1976. Although
the debt service ratio may continue to increase gradually, it is expected to
peak around 1980 at about 19 percent and decline thereafter. However, taking
into account Yugoslavia's debt service record and the measures taken in the
past to control balance of payments problems, as well as the prospective
growth of production and structural improvement of the balance of trade,
Yugoslavia remains creditworthy for a substantial amount of Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN YUGOSLAVIA
19.       The Bank has made 35 loans totalling about US$1,160 million to
Yugoslavia. Of this amount approximately 50 percent (US$571.4 million) has
been for 13 loans for the transportation sector - seven for highways totalling
US$220 million, four for railways totalling US$248 million, US$108.4 million
for natural gas and oil pipelines, and $44 million for a port project. Bank
lending has generally concentrated on infrastructure including, in addition to
the transportation loans, power (three loans totalling US$135 million), tele-
communications (one loan for US$40 million), three multipurpose projects
totalling US$103 million and US$6 million for a water supply and sewerage
project. Nine loans have also been made for industry and two each for tourism
and agriculture. IFC has made investments in nine Yugoslav enterprises total-
ling about US$130 million. The Bank disbursed $126 million during FY75, com-
pared with $59.4 million in FY74, and about $140 million is projected for FY76.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of
March 31, 1976, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
20.       The major objectives of current and future Bank lending to Yugoslavia
are to accelerate development in the less-developed regions of the country; to
promote agricultural development, particularly among the small private farmers
by providing basic infrastructure and credit for the financing of farm develop-
ment, equipment and processing facilities; to promote structural reforms in
major sectors of the economy through improved coordination and the strengthen-
ing of institutions; and to provide Yugoslavia with long-term external capital



- 8 -
and thus help to alleviate critical shortages of convertible foreign exchange,
while encouraging and promoting Yugoslavia's efforts to tap other sources of
medium- and long-term capital. These objectives are basically the same as
those which have guided Bank lending in previous years, but efforts to give
special support to the less-developed regions are being strengthened.
21.       A proposed loan of US$20 million for the Morava Region development
project (water supply, sewerage, and water resources planning) has been re-
cently submitted for your consideration. A proposed loan for the Sarajevo
air pollution control project (US$38 million) is being submitted concurrently
with this loan and a loan of US$50 million for a second industrial credit proj-
ect has been negotiated and is expected to be submitted shortly for consid-
eration. Over the next two years loans envisaged include a second loan for
agricultural credit, two loans for irrigation, and a loan for agricultural
industries, all for the less developed regions. Highway, railway and power
transmission projects during the same period will both assist the less-
developed regions and promote structural reforms in the transport and energy
sectors. IFC is currently investigating several new investment opportunities
to encourage joint ventures which would provide technical, management and
marketing expertise as well as long-term capital.
22.       In addition to substantial assistance given in identifying and pre-
paring projects for Bank financing, the Bank is providing technical assistance
in several areas. A series of regional studies of the four less-developed
regions of Yugoslavia was initiated three years ago and three studies, cover-
ing Kosovo, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, have been completed. The fourth
study, of Montenegro, will be completed soon. This series will contribute to
better assessment of development programs and will assist both the Governments
and the Bank in formulating development strategies for these regions. An energy
sector review was undertaken by the Bank in cooperation with the Federal Govern-
ment to review the energy sector survey which the Federal Government had been
undertaking as well as to review the work being done on energy problems in the
individual Republics with the objective of analyzing the main problems, issues
and policy options for meeting Yugoslavia's future energy needs. A Bank as-
sisted study on the improvement of the financial mechanism has been concluded
and its recommendations have been included in draft legislation for a new
banking law. Bank cooperation in a training program for auditors of the Social
Accounting Service, which audits all enterprises and Government activities,
including Bank financed projects, has progressed satisfactorily and further
training is underway in cooperation with an international accounting firm. As-
sistance from EDI, as well as through Bank operations, has been directed to-
wards the improvement of project evaluation.
23.       The level of Bank lending has remained constant averaging about
US$200 million annually during the period FY74-76. Although this represents
only a small proportion of the country's need for external finance, it is
equivalent to almost one-third of the annual long-term official capital in-
flow in convertible currencies. The outstanding debt to the Bank is expected
to gradually decline from its current level of less than 10 percent of Yugos-
lavia's total external debt. Service on Bank loans as a proportion of total
debt service was 4.0 percent in 1974 and is projected to increase to about 6
percent in 1980.

PART III - WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE IN SARAJEVO
24.       Sarajevo is the capital city and economic center of the Republic
of Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is located in a mountain valley in south-central
Yugoslavia. Large-scale migration from surrounding underdeveloped areas
tripled its population to over 300,000 between 1945 and 1975 and it is ex-
pected to grow to 410,000 by 1985. The most densely populated part of the
city lies along the Miljacka River. At the western edge of the city the
Miljacka River flows into the Bosna River which flows through the most
densely populated part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Because of its rapid growth
and special geographic and climatic conditions, Sarajevo has developed severe
air and water pollution problems which threaten the health of its population.
The city is attempting to solve both of these problems through coordinated
water supply and sewerage and air pollution control projects. The Bank is
assisting with both projects and my Report and Recommendation to you on a
proposed loan for the Sarajevo Air Pollution Control Project (Report No.
P-1839-YU dated May 12, 1976) is being submitted simultaneously with this one.
Water Supply, Sewerage and Water Pollution
25.       The existing water distribution system in Sarajevo is old and in-
adequate. Most of the distribution pipes in the old part of the city were
installed more than sixty years ago and are badly corroded. Within the
distribution network separation of the pressure zones is incomplete, leading
to very high pressure in portions of the network. Primarily as a result of
this, more than one-third of the water entering the system is lost. In ad-
dition, the development of water supply and sewerage infrastructure has not
kept pace with the rapid growth in population. The water supply system was
operating at design capacity in 1969; between 1969 and December 1974 water
was rationed in many areas of the city. Recent minor expansion of the system
is expected to meet demand through 1978. Additional water supplies to be
provided by this proposed project will meet demand through 1985.
26.       The sewerage system is in even worse condition.    The main collectors
were built between 1902 and 1914 and were designed to serve a population of
60,000. About 40 percent of the sewered area is served by separate sanitary
sewers; the remainder is served by combined sanitary and storm sewers. The
main collectors empty directly into the Miljacka River as it flows through
the city. About 20,000 households outside the sewer system discharge wastes
into nearby streams or septic tanks. The city's hospitals empty their wastes,
without treatment, into the municipal sewage system. During the summer the
sewage flow in the Miljacka River is about three times the minimum river flow.
At this time, the Miljacka River has the characteristics of an open sewerage
canal, is the source of considerable stench and poses a serious health hazard.
27.       Furthermore, because of the deterioration of water supply pipes
and sewage pipes (often laid in close proximity to each other), sewage infil-
trates the water supply system. In spite of the fact that raw water quality



- 10 -
at the source is generally good and supplies are regularly chlorinated,
bacteriological pollution of distributed water is detected frequently, partic-
ularly in the old part of the city.
28.       The pollution of the rivers, streams and water supply poses a ser-
ious health hazard to the city, its surrounding communities, and the communi-
ties along the Bosna River downstream from Sarajevo. Some typical waterborne
diseases which could be transmitted to the population are typhoid, cholera,
paratyphoid, bacillary dysentery, poliomyelitis and infectious hepatitis. In
the recent past, Sarajevo has suffered epidemics of typhoid, hepatitis and
diarrhea. Outbreaks of hepatitis occur frequently. Between 1967 and 1973,
over 8,500 cases of waterborne diseases were reported and, of those almost
3,000 of the patients required hospitalization.
29.       Water supply and sewage disposal are the responsibility of local
communities in Yugoslavia. To preserve and enhance the quality of inland and
coastal waters, a Federal Commission for Water Management establishes the
basic framework for maintaining water quality, and Republic Commissions for
Water Management set standards and coordinate programs to improve water
quality. Financial assistance for improving water quality is available
through Republic Water Funds. However, the ultimate responsibility for pro-
viding water services and meeting the established quality standards rests
with the communes. The citizens of Sarajevo assign a high priority to solv-
ing their water supply and water pollution problems, and in 1972, by refer-
endum, voted to tax their incomes to provide financing for improving the
water supply and sewerage system.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
30.       The nature and extent of Sarajevo's water supply and water pollu-
tion problems, as well as the extremely severe air pollution problems, were
first brought to the Bank's attention by the Sarajevo authorities in mid-1972,
followed by a formal request in early 1973 from the Federal Government for as-
sistance in financing programs to reduce air and water pollution in Sarajevo.
Feasibility studies for adequate water supply and sewerage systems which had
been prepared in 1970 were revised in 1974. Bank missions to assist with
project preparation began in January 1973. Appraisals of both the water sup-
ply and sewerage project and the air pollution control project were substan-
tially completed in December 1974. Negotiations were held in July and August
1975 in Washington. The Yugoslav delegation was led by Mr. Dane Maljkovic,
President of the Sarajevo City Assembly. Subsequent to negotiations, delays
were experienced in ensuring the financing and gas supplies for the air pol-
lution control project. Pending resolution of these issues, Sarajevo requested
that the further consideration of the water supply and sewerage project be
postponed so that both projects could be implemented simultaneously. Those
issues were resolved in March 1976. The appraisal of the water supply and
sewerage project was updated and revised by a Bank mission in February, 1976.



Project Description
31.       The proposed loan and project are summarized in Annex TII and des-
cribed in detail in the report "Appraisal of Sarajevo Water Supply and Sewer-
age Project: Report No. 1167-YI' and dated May 7, 1976 which is being distri-
buted separately to the Executive Directors. The project would provide facil-
ities to expand and improve the water supply and sewerage systems in the city.
32.       The proposed water supply facilities are part of a master plan to
expand the city's supply and to rehabilitate and extend the distribution net-
work. They are designed to provide Sarajevo with an adequate supply of water
through 1985 and to serve an area approximately twice that served by the pre-
sent system. This would be achieved by the construction of an infiltration
gallery, reservoirs, pumping stations and expansion of existing reservoirs
and pumping stations; installation and replacement of water mains and distri-
bution pipes; replacement of obsolete service connections; provision of re-
lated control systems; construction of offices; and engineering services for
designs, supervision, project administration, training and hydrogeological
studies to prepare a water resources master plan. Pollution of the city's
waters would be reduced by construction of new collectors and main sewers; re-
placement of worn-out sewer laterals and service connections; construction of
sewage treatment facilities; installation of sludge filters and renovation of
the existing landfill; installation of an activated sludge pilot plant for ex-
perimentation in sewage treatment processes to attain optimal utilization of
the main treatment facilities; and related engineering services.
Project Execution
33.       The Sarajevo Water Supply and Sewerage Enterprise (Preduzece Vodovod
i Kanalizacija Sarajevo, or Vodovod) would implement the project and be the
borrower under the loan. Vodovod is an independent Organization of Associated
Labor consisting of three Basic Organizations of Associated Labor - Water Sup-
ply, Sewerage and Administration. It is operated on the principle of workers'
self-management, as are all enterprises in Yugoslavia, but because it provides
vital public services the workers share control of certain activities with the
Sarajevo city government. The city approves Vodovod's working statutes, work
program, functional or organizational changes, appointment of the manager, and
tariff rates. Vodovod is well managed by a competent and experienced staff
(their water supply engineers have provided consulting services to other towns
in Yugoslavia). The sewerage staff have no operational experience in sewage
treatment and staff training would therefore be part of the project. Consult-
ants are assisting Vodovod with the preparation of final design and tender do-
cuments and would also assist with the supervision of construction (Loan Agree-
ment Section 3.02).
34.       Because sludge from the sewage treatment plant would be discarded
on the city landfill, Vodovod would enter into an appropriate agreement with
Rad, the Sarajevo enterprise responsible for solid waste disposal, for the
joint ownership and operation of the landfill (Loan Agreement Section 3.03).



- 12 -
35.       Vodovod would begin construction of the water supply and sewerage
project in late 1976 and expects to complete it by the end of 1980.
Coordination
36.       Because the water supply and sewerage and air pollution control
projects are being pursued simultaneously by separate entities, the City As-
sembly would coordinate project implementation and the Bank would sign a
Project Coordination Agreement with the Assembly. Construction coordination
is particularly important to ensure that there is a minimum disruption to
normal city life and that both projects are completed on schedule. The In-
stitute for the Construction of the City, a special unit of the city govern-
ment responsible for the physical development of the urban area, would be the
coordinating agent on behalf of the City Assembly (Project Coordination Agree-
ment Section 2.01).
37.       In addition to its construction coordinating role, the city govern-
ment would establish protection zones for Sarajevo's groundwater sources (Proj-
ect Coordination Agreement Section 2.04).
Project Cost Estimates and Financing Plan
38.       The total estimated cost of the project is US$95.7 million (exclud-
ing interest during construction).- The estimate includes duties and taxes
(about 5 percent of project costs) and an allowance of about 36 percent for
physical and price contingencies. The estimated foreign exchange component is
US$38.5 million. Details of the cost estimates are shown in Annex III.
39.       The proposed Bank loan of US$45 million would finance 98 percent of
the estimated foreign exchange cost of equipment and materials, civil works,
and engineering services of the project, and interest during construction on
the Bank loan (US$7.6 million). This would represent about 44 percent of
total costs (including interest during construction on the Bank loan).
40.       During this period (1976-80), Vodovod would require financing for
project costs (US$95.7 million), interest during construction (US$8.8 million),
and other capital expenditures 1/ (US$7.8 million), or a total of US$112.3
million. In addition to the Bank loan, funds would be provided from internal
cash generation (30 percent), local borrowing (8 percent) and capital contri-
butions from the Republic Water Fund and city government (22 percent). The
City Assembly has agreed that it would provide additional funds to meet any
cost overruns (Project Coordination Agreement Section 2.02 and Loan Agreement
Section 5.07).

tion of water sources.

Financial Performance
41.       Vodovod is a financially autonomous and viable enterprise.    The rate
of return on average net fixed assets was 9.2 percent in 1973, 13.1 percent in
1974 and is estimated to be 15.4 percent in 1975. During the construction
period it is projected to average over 13 percent, rising to a peak of about
19 percent in 1977. After completion of the project it would fall back to
about 6 percent (9 percent for water supply and 3 percent for sewerage) be-
cause of the very large increase (threefold for water and thirteenfold for
sewerage) in the net value of fixed assets.
42.       To generate sufficient resources to expand the water and sewerage
system in line with demand Vodovod introduced significant tariff increases in
1971 which, together with funds from a special income tax levied by the city,
enabled it to finance the improvements which ended daily water rationing in
December 1974. To generate the cash needed for the project Vodovod plans to
undertake further tariff increases. The City Assembly has passed a resolu-
tion authorizing annual increases totalling 200 percent for water and 400 per-
cent for sewerage between 1973 and 1980; however, each annual increase must
be approved by the City Assembly before implementation. The increases planned
for the period 1973-1976 have been implemented. To ensure that the required
financing from internal resources is available, and to maintain its finan-
cial strength in the future, it has been agreed that Vodovod would implement
whichever is the higher: the presently scheduled tariff increases or a
modified schedule of increases which would provide sufficient revenues to
finance not less than 30 percent of the cost of investments in water and
sewerage facilities during the period of construction (1976 to 1980), and in
each year thereafter not less than 35 percent of the average cost of invest-
ments during each consecutive three year period comprising one actual and two
forecast years (Loan Agreement Section 5.04). The City Assembly has agreed
that it would approve Vodovod's requests for tariff increases to meet the
above requirements (Project Coordination Agreement, Section 2.03(b)).
43.      *Vodovod's debt equity ratio in 1974 was 16:84.    With the increase
in borrowing for the project, it would rise to 42:58 in 1980. Vodovod has
agreed that, except as the Bank shall otherwise agree, they would not incur
additional debt unless their net cash generation before depreciation and
interest exceeds 1.3 times their debt service in any future year, including
debt service on the debt to be incurred (Loan Agreement Section 5.05).
Procurement and Disbursement
44.       Materials and equipment contracts estimated to cost more than
US$200,000 would be let after international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank Group's "Guidelines for Procurement". For the purpose of bid
comparison, qualified domestic manufacturers would be given a margin of pre-
ference of 15 percent or customs duties, whichever is the less. Civil works
contracts estimated to cost more than US$500,000 would be awarded after inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's "Guidelines



- 14 -
for Procurement". The remaining materials and equipment, and civil works con-
tracts would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally
in accordance with the procedures of the Federal Government which are satis-
factory. Vodovod may carry out by force account minor works, such as renova-
tions and modifications to the existing water and sewer networks, under ar-
rangements acceptable to the Bank (Loan Agreement Schedule 4, Section C).
The total value of such minor works is expected to be less than US$10 million.
All equipment supply and civil works contracts are expected to be won by
Yugoslav enterprises, except those for the supply of equipment for the sewage
treatment plant and other specialized equipment, which are expected to be
awarded to foreign firms.
45.       Expenditures by the City Assembly and Vodovod for the preparation of
feasibility studies, final designs and tender documents, amounting to about
US$1.5 million, are expected to be incurred prior to loan signature. Retroac-
tive Bank financing of such expenditures from January 1974 of not more than
US$750,000 is recommended (Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, paragraph 4).
46.       The loan would be disbursed as follows:
(a)  Equipment and Materials   -  100 percent of the c.i.f. cost of di-
rectly imported materials, equipment
and pipe and 50 percent of the total
cost of locally supplied materials,
equipment and pipe.
(b)  Civil Works               -  30 percent of the cost of construction
and installation contracts, including
force account work.
(c)  Engineering Services      -  50 percent of the cost of consulting
services and training.
(d)  Interest During Con-      -  100 percent of the interest during
struction                    construction on the Bank Loan.
Disbursements would begin in the last quarter of 1976 and be completed in
March 1981.
Audit
47.       Vodovod's accounts would be audited' by the Social Accounting Serv-
ice (SAS) or another experienced auditing firm acceptable to the Bank (Loan
Agreement Section 5.02). With Bank encouragement, the SAS started a program
in January 1974 under which its staff are being trained by foreign consult-
ants in auditing methods consistent with modern auditing standards. The pro-
gram is currently in its second phase in which additional SAS staff are being
trained, under the consultants' guidance, by those who participated in the



- 15 -
first phase. Vodovod gave the Bank informal assurances that the group of spe-
cially trained auditors would be asked to conduct their audits beginning with
the accounts for the year ending December 31, 1976. In the event the special
group cannot be assigned to this audit Vodovod would engage other independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank.
Justification
48.       The pollution of river water in Sarajevo threatens the health and
well-being of its population as well as the population residing along the
Bosna River downstream from Sarajevo. Without corrective action this threat
would increase constantly as the population grows. With the expansion and
improvement of the water supply and sewage disposal systems adequate potable
water would be available and the threat of waterborne diseases would be sig-
nificantly reduced. There would be a variety of benefits, including medical
cost savings, increased productivity of workers, savings on future septic tank
expenditures, increase in property values along currently polluted waterways
and an increase in the recreational potential of these waterways. The danger
of potential major epidemics of waterborne diseases would be substantially
reduced. Sarajevo would become a better place in which to live and work.
49.       The abovementioned benefits are difficult to quantify; however, using
the city's authorized 1976 water tariff rates, the internal economic rate of
return of the water supply system would be about 15.6 percent. The major just-
ification for the sewerage system investment is that the collection and treat-
ment of sewage in Sarajevo is necessary for healthful and orderly development
of the area and the proposed method of collecting and treating the sewage is
the least cost solution.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan 657 Telecommunications: US$40.0 million Loan of February 20, 1970;
Effective Date: August 30, 1970; Closing Date: March 31, 1976.
After initial delays the Bank-financed part of the project is pro-
ceeding satisfactorily and is now nearing completion. The installation of
trunk exchanges which are not financed by the Bank, has been delayed and
will be fully completed shortly. We are in communication with the borrower
with respect to the undisbursed balance of $200,000.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 751 Fifth Highway: US$35.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971; Effective Date:
June 2, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
After an initial delay of about eight months in fulfilling the con-
ditions for effectiveness of the loan, construction work on all sections has
progressed well. All road sections but one are open for traffic. Completion
of the remaining section has been delayed due to lack of funds. While costs
have increased, future earmarked revenues from fuel taxes, particularly on
purchases of fuel by Italian motorists crossing the border to buy cheaper
fuel in Yugoslavia, have decreased. The final section is now expected to be
completed by September, 1977.
Loan 752 Bernardin Tourism: US$10.0 million Loan of June 18, 1971; Effective
Date: May 31, 1972; Closing Date: June 20, 1977.
There have been delays in implementation of the project due to
delays in making the loan effective, appointing consultants, providing the
necessary infrastructure and approvals by local authorities. As a result
disbursements are behind schedule. Bids received in July 1974 indicated that
the project, if it were to be implemented as originally envisaged (2,500 beds)
would cost approximately 100 percent above the originally estimated cost of
US$25.6 million. This increase was mainly due to rapid inflation in construc-
tion costs. The Bank and the project sponsors have agreed to finance a re-
duced complex containing some 1,616 beds (Amendment to Loan 752-YU, December
16, 1974, R74-258). The total cost would be US$39.9 million requiring addi-
tional financing of about US$14 million. Financing for the revised project
has been agreed upon. The port hotel is scheduled for pre-opening occupancy
in April, 1976 and the village hotel complex is scheduled to open in May 1976;
however, serious construction problems with regard to the foundations were
encountered in the case of the cliff hotel, the completion of which has been
delayed until October, 1976.
Loan 777 Ibar Multipurpose Water: US$45.0 million Loan of June 20, 1971;
Effective Date: May 31, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The start of project work was delayed for one year. Construction is
now underway with the main dam scheduled for completion by late 1976. A small
part of the irrigation network has been completed with the remainder expected
to be completed in 1978. Project costs have been above appraisal estimates
but the overrun financing is being provided by the Province of Kosovo. Delays
have been encountered in the arrangements for boundary adjustment and agricul-
tural extension services. Consultants have been recently engaged to help find
solutions.

Loan 782 Babin Kuk Tourism: US$20.0 million Loan of July 21, 1971; Effective
Date:  June 12, 1972; Closing Date:   July 31, 1977.
There have been delays in the implementation of the project due
to delays in making the loan effective and in mobilizing consultants. Ac-
cordingly disbursements are behind schedule. Although these problems have
now been largely resolved, the project is almost two years behind schedule.
Bids for civil works and estimates for other components indicated that the
project would cost at least twice as much as originally estimated (US$49.9
million). This increase is largely due to rapid inflation in construction
costs. The Bank and the project sponsors have agreed to finance a reduced
complex containing some 2,034 beds (Amendment to Loan 782-YU, December 16,
1974, R74-259). The total cost would be US$51.5 million requiring additional
financing of about US$1.6 million. This additional financing for the revised
project has been arranged but in light of the increased financial commitments
necessary from the local banks and a re-evaluation of the financial capabilities
of the sponsor necessary to implement a project of this size, the local banks
and the Borrower have proposed and are discussing with the Bank a change in
sponsorship. This proposed change in sponsorship will be submitted to the
Executive Directors for their consideration after being fully reviewed by
the Bank. Meanwhile, construction is proceeding well and all civil works are
near completion. The hotels are scheduled to open in June, 1976.
Loan 836 Power Transmission: US$75.0 million Loan of June 23, 1972; Effective
Date: December 29, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Project execution began about one year behind schedule mainly be-
cause of coordination difficulties and inherent delays in reaching agreement
among 12 borrowers. This is the first attempt at countrywide coordination
in the sector. All main contracts have been awarded and construction is
proceeding satisfactorily; however, the cost of the project has increased
84 percent from $225 million to $415 million chiefly due to escalation in
overall costs, including both civil works and equipment. The cost overrun
is expected to be financed from funds from the Federal Republic of Germany
and the borrowers' own resources. Action on appointment of management con-
sultants to help improve planning operation and management of the inter-
connected power system is still pending. Early difficulties with reporting,
changes in the organization of the sector, and determination of the financial
performance of individual borrowers have largely been resolved.
Loan 894 Agricultural Industries (Macedonia): US$31.0 million Loan of May 25,
1973; Effective Date: November 28, 1973; Closing Date: December
31,1978.
Sub-projects accounting for all but Din 7.75 million ($430,500
equivalent) of the amount allocated have been approved by the lending insti-
tution. Private sector demands for sub-loans have by far been in excess of
financing available under the project. Twenty-one sub-projects have been



ANNEX II
Page 5
completed and eighteen are under construction in the social sector. Of the
three studies encompassed by the project the one on irrigation has been
completed while the other two on marketing and private farm production
are in the final draft stage.
Loan 916 Naftagas Pipeline: US$59.4 million Loan of June 25, 1973; Effective
Date: March 22, 1974; Closing Date: June 20, 1977.
Bids received on pipes and equipment exceeded appraisal estimates
and civil works costs have increased so that project costs are now about 71
percent above the appraisal estimate. Accordingly the project has been re-
defined. Phase I is a reduced version of the original plan. Phase II would
provide for a pipeline extension to link up with the pipeline to be con-
structed under the proposed Sarajevo Air Pollution Control Project, for
which additional Bank financing will be proposed. Naftagas has obtained
additional local currency financing required for Phases I and II. The pro-
posed change will be submitted to the Executive Directors for their con-
sideration.
Loan 947 Kikinda Iron Foundry: US$14.5 million Loan of November 30, 1973;
Effective Date: May 28, 1974; Closing Date: March 31, 1978.
Effectiveness was delayed about five months due primarily to the
extra time required for the ratification of the Guarantee Agreement by the
Federal Assembly. Project implementation is about four months ahead of
schedule. Total project costs now are about 13 percent (Din. 79.0 million,
about US$4.6 million equivalent) above appraisal estimates due to large in-
creases in local costs. Financing of this cost overrun has been arranged
with a local bank.
Loan 965 IMT Tractor Factory Expansion: US$18.5 million Loan of February 22,
1974; Effective Date: June 11, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The factory was officially inaugurated on March 7, 1976. Completion
work on minor portions of the project, however, is continuing.
Loan 966 FOB Iron Foundry: US$15.0 million Loan of February 22, 1974;
Effective Date: May 28, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
There presently is a 3 month delay in project implementation but
completion is expected to be on schedule. Local costs are about 27 percent
(Din. 173 million, about US$10.0 million equivalent) above appraisal estimates
due to design changes and domestic inflation. Financing of this local cost
overrun has been arranged with a local bank.
Loan 990 Sixth Highway: US$30.0 million Loan of May 31, 1974; Effective Date:
December 10, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Two out of six road sections are complete and the remainder should
be completed by the end of 1976. Two requests for changes in road align-
ments have been agreed; both changes were requested to accommodate communi-
ties which would be better served by the realignments.

Loan 1012 Macedonia/Kosovo Industrial Credit: US$28.0 million Loan of June
21, 1974; Effective Date: December 19, 1974; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
It is expected that the loan would be fully committed by September
1976 and disbursed by end-1977, ahead of appraisal estimates. The reasons
being: use of Bank funds to finance a greater than anticipated proportion
of the foreign exchange requirements of projects financed by the banks; the
suitability of Bank funds for investors' projects and the overall scarcity
of investment resources in Yugoslavia; and the banks' ability to adapt quickly
to the methodology proposed by IBRD for appraisal of projects submitted
for Bank financing.
Loan 1013 Bosnia Herzegovina/Montenegro Industrial Credit: US$22.0 million
Loan of June 21, 1974; Effective Date: December 19, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The note under Loan 1012 above applies also to this loan.
Loan 1026 Fourth Railway: US$93.0 million Loan of July 10, 1974; Effective
Date: February 12, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
The project consists of the 1974-76 slice of the railways' invest-
ment plan. After serious delays in 1974, project execution improved sub-
stantially in 1975 but remains somewhat below appraisal forecasts. Delays
have been due principally to financial difficulties. Government and the
Community of Railways are having difficulties in raising tariffs sufficient
to cover inflationary costs and the Bank is currently reviewing this matter
with the Government. There has been good progress on investment planning
and project management.
Loan 1060 Port of Bar: US$44.0 million Loan of December 11, 1974; Effective
Date: June 13, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
In general the Project is progressing well, but settlement of com-
pensation to occupiers of expropriated land and construction of alternative
housing must be accelerated to enable the construction of the railway mar-
shalling yards serving the new port facilities in due time. The Bank con-
tacted the Government of the Republic of Montenegro which has intervened
in this matter.
Loan 1066 Dubrovnik Water Supply and Wastewater: US$6.0 million Loan of
December 24, 1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1975; Closing Date:
December 31, 1978.
Preliminary works are underway, and services to the Bank financed
Babin Kuk hotel complex (Loan 782-YU) will be finished in time for the
initial operation of the hotel complex.

Procurement
Arrangements:   Materials and equipment contracts estimated to cost more
than US$200,000 would be let after international competi-
tive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's "Guide-
lines for Procurement". For the purpose of bid comparison,
qualified domestic manufacturers would be given a margin
of preference of 15 percent or customs duties, whichever
is less. Civil works contracts estimated to cost more
than US$500,000 would be awarded after international com-
petitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's
"Guidelines for Procurement". The remaining materials and
equipment, and civil works contracts would be awarded on
the basis of competitive bidding advertised locally in
accordance with the procedures of the Federal Government
which are satisfactory. Vodovod will carry out by force
account minor works, such as renovations and modifications
to the existing water and sewer networks. The total value
of such minor works is expected to be about US$10 million.
All equipment supply and civil works contracts are expected
to be won by Yugoslav firms except those for the supply of
equipment for the sewage treatment plant and other special-
ized equipment which are expected to be awarded to foreign
contractors. Expenditure by the City Assembly and Vodovod
for preparation of feasibility studies, final designs and
