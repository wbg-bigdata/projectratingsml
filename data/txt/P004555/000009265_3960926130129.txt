BACON MANITO GEOTHERMAL POWER PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJEC SWMMARY
Borrowers:             National Power Corporation (NPC)
Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC)
Guarantors             Republic of the Philippines
Beneficiar-y           PNOC Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC)
Amounts                Two loans amounting to an aggregate of US$100 million,
consisting of a loan to NPC of US$59 million and a loan
to PNOC of US$41 million.
Lendinit Tomes         Repayable over 20 years, including five years of grace,
at the standard variable interest rate.
RelendinE Terms        PMOC would relend the proceeds of its loan to PNOC-EDC
under the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan.
Pro4ect DescriptLons  The project constitutes an integrated approach to
resource development, power generation and transmLssion.
the project's main objectives are to (a) develop an
existing geothermal steam field and a new 110 MM power
plant at Bacon Manitol (b) support the delineation and
assessment of geothermal sites for use in Lu:.;
(c) support measures for upgrading and expanding NPC'u
system facilities; and (d) support Institution-building
and financLal recovery efforts at NPC. The project
provides for ti) drilling of about 18 wells for
delineationlappraisal of geothermal sites, drilling of
additlonal productian/injection wells at Bacon Manito I
field, and construction of a steam-gathering system;
(II) construction of 2 x 55 MV power plant Including
turbine generators, auxiliary equipment and 32 km of
230 kV transmission line; (Iii) construction of 142 km
of 115 kV single and double circuit transmission lines,
rehabilitation of substations and extension of
conmunlcatLon links; and (iv) consultancy servlces.
Rilskss                The project entails no unusual twchnlcal rLsks.
Extensive scLentLflc LnvestLgatLons and independent
resource assessment have confirmed existence of
sufficient steam rese: ves. NPC and PNOC have staff
experlenced in supervLsLon and executlon of works
similar to those required under this project.  However,
as a result of financLal weaknase, NPC could have

I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. Overview
1.1      The energy sector acquired pre-eminence in the Philippine economy as
a result of the oil crisis of the last decade. At the time of the first major
oil price increase in 1973, imported oil accounted for 952 of total energy
consumption. As a result of the Government's implementation of an energy
diversification/management policy, the ratio of imported oil to total energy
usage declined to 56X in 1986. Also, total consumption of energy, which had
grown rapidly prior to 1973 (at 9.62 p.a. during 1965-73), increased at the
modest level of 3.82 p.a. between 1973 to 1979. After the second oil shock,
consumption actually declined continuously from the peak of 9.2 million tons
of oil equivalent (MfTOE) in 1979 to 8.5 MMTOE in 1983 and 7.1 MMTOE in 1985.
Several factors contributed to this decline including the low GDP growth of
the early 19808, the decrease in GDP of the 1984-85 period, and the increased
use of non-conventional energy. Energy usage has started to increase with the
recent economic recovery; total energy consumptior. reached 7.5 MMTOE in 1986
and 9.6 MHTOE in 1987, representing growth rate of 62 and 282 for 1986 and
1987, respectively.
1.2      The shares of energy consumption by sector have remained stable over
the years. The residential/commercial sector's accounts for about 142 of
usage, industrial consumption 51X, and transport 31?. The share of electri-
city as a proportion of energy consumption has increased considerably; power
generation accounted for about 47X of primary energy consumptica in 1986,
compared to only 222 in 1973.
B. Domestic Energy Resources
1.3      Indigenous energy resources are relatively modest and proven reserves
of petroleum, coal and of natutai gas are small. The proven reserves of
petroleum are estimated at 4 million tons of oil equivalent (MMTOE) while
potential reserves are projected at a possible 14 MKTOE. Domestic oil fields
at Nido, Cadlao and Matinloc produced 14,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) and
contributed 7.42 of total prinary energy consumption when commercial produc-
tion began in 1979; since then, production rates from these fields have
decreased so that, by 1987, domestic oil's share of total energy consumption
was only 2.22. Natural gas deposits, found in Northern Luzon, are considered
to be sub-commercial; and probable uranium reserves are estimated at about 1.2
MMTOE. Its total potential coal resource is estimated at about 1,500 millions
tonnes but most of it is low grade and expensive to mine. The major coal
fields at Semirara (152.1 million metric tons (MT)), Cagayan (65.8 million
MT), Surigao (36.8 million MT) and Zamboanga (18.6 million HT)--which account
for an estimated 89.42 of total proven coal reserves--contributed only 4.32 uf
total energy consumption in 1987. Philippine hydropower resources are quite
substantial, with a theoretical power potential in excess of 10,000 MW.
However, development of hydro resources is relatively costly due to the
distance of the bettor sites from the main transmission grid. Hydropower
contributed 10.22 of total energy consumption in 1985. Geothermal reserves
are not yet fully evaluated, but about 4.431 MW of probable reserves, 1640 MV



- 2 -
of which have been tested, but only 894 MW of capacity has been installed. In
1987, geothermal energy generated about 221 of the nation's electricity
supply. biomass resources abound in the Philippines, with an estimated annual
potential of 1.0 MMTOk from agricultural wastes. This source's share of total
primary energy consumption was 16.8? in 1985.
C. Energa Sector Institutions
1.4      The basic organization of the energy sector was established by a
Presidential Decree in 1977. That decree created the Ministry of Energy (MOE)
as the central policy, planning and regulatory agency for energy; in turn, MOE
operated through two major bureaus, one for energy development (BED) and the
other for energy utilizatlon (BEU). The responsibilities of the Philippine
National Oil Company (PNOC), formed in 1973 to assure the adequacy of the
country's oil supply, were extended in 1976 to include development of
indigenous energy resources; PNOC-Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDC)
became responsible for geothermal exploration and development. The National
Power Corporation (NPC) (responsible for power generation and transmission),
and the National Elactrification Administration (NEA) (responsible for rural
electrification), were also strengthened by that Decree. PNOC and NPC were
attached to MOE for program and policy coordination. A committee to coordi-
nate their activities was established within the Ministry, and the Minister
held the position of Chairman of the Board cf both PNOC and NPC. NEA, in
turn, was attached to the Ministry of Human Settlements. Following the change
of Government in 1986, MOE was dissolved in June 1986, and all its units were
placed temporarily under the Office of the President. In June 1987, Executive
Order 193 formally placed the Office of Energy Affairs (OEA) under the Office
of the President and gave it primary responsibility for the formulation,
planning, implementation and coordination of policies and programs in the
field of energy.   NPC and PNOC were brought under the direct control of the
Office of the President. The National Coal Authority was abolished and its
regulatory functions transferred to the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB). A part
of BEU was transferred to ERB which was given price-setting authority over
private sector suppliers of petroleum and electricity. The organization
structure of the energy sector is still somewhat fluid; working arrangements
under this structure have not yet been established. Coordination of the
sector's entities would still need to be strengthened and the Bank is expected
to assist this process through the Public Resource Management Loan, the
proposed project and the ongoing energy sector study (para. 1.23).
D. Energy Sector Obiectives, Issues and Strategy
1.5      Prior to the first oil price hike of 1973, the Philippines did not
have a comprehensive formulation of energy sector programs and policies.
Initial reactions to the 1973 oil crisis focused mostly on securing a stable
and adequate supply of crude petroleum. To complement this, a longer term
program of (a) indigenous energy resource development and (b) energy demand
management was implemented. The objective of indigenous energy resource
development was met through heavy Government participation in developing oil
and non-oil resources. The search for domestic crude oil sources was pursued
under an innovative production sharing scheme. The policy of diversifying
energy sources focused on coal development as of 1976, geothermal exploration
and development as of 1978, and construction of the 620 MW Philippine Nuclear



- 3 -
Power Plant (PNPP) in 1979-85. Non-conventional energy development was left
primarily to private enterprise, with the Government providing fiscal incen-
tives for research, development and utilization of these resources.
1.6      Energy demand management was initially focused on direct Government
iiterveation via fuel allocation and rationing schemes. In 1975, the Energy
Conservat-on Program was enacted; however, the Government quickly recognized
that pricing was more permanent and effective than legislation as a policy
tool. Thereafter, the Government pricing policy emphasized a rapid and full
adjustment of domestic petroleum product prices to uorld market levels.
1.7      Despite the notable past success in the energy diversification and
management policies, the sector is now facing a number of issues with regard
to its long term development strategy.  These issues are all the more argent
because of the substantial capital needed for energy development at a time
when the country is facing other urgent economic prioritiess
(a) Until 1986, the Government was planning to meet increases in demand
for electricity in Luzon with generation from PNPP. The Government's
decision, made in the summer of 1986, to mothball PNPP along with the
downgrading of generating capacity in Tiwi geothermal power plant and
the relatively sharp increase in power demand in 1987, created a
sudden need to reexamine and optimize energy options for meeting
expected increases in demand for electricity;
(b) The recent collapse in the international energy prices has introduced
considerable uncertainty regarding the economics of domestic energy
resources. In particular, the development of domestic coal, geo-
thermal steam and certain hydro resources may no longer be viable
alternatives to energy imports;
(c) The Government's decision to abolish MOE has led to a lack of coordi-
nation of energy sector activities and, in particular, a lack of
clear direction for energy resource development;
(d)  Finally, the Government's energy pricing policy needs to be reexa-
mined. In particular, further rationalization of power tariffs and
pricing policies for geothermal steam and coal are needed in order to
eltsure the economic efficiency of their development and use.
With the Bank's assistance, the Government is planning to: (a) reexamine the
economics of various sources of energy; (b) prepare a consolidated plan for
development and utilization of indigenous energy; and (c) strengthen a coordi-
nating body so that it can resume many of MOE's former responsibilities.
E. The Power Sector
1.8      Overview.  The electric power industry in the Philippines is divided
into two segments: (a) generation and transmission; and (b) distribution.
The industry has a number of participating organizations, some of which are
publicly, and others privately, owned. By far, the largest organization is
NPC, which is responsible for the generation of bulk power and its transmi;-
sion through a number of grids that serve virtually the entire country except



- 4 -
for remote rural areas and smuJl outlying islands. Power is distributed to
major urban areas by a number of investor-owned utilities. Of these, the
largest is the Manila Electric Company (MERALCO), which serves Metro Manila
and accounts for about 70X of NPC's sales in Luzon. The rural areas are
served by over 100 cooperatives, a few of which are either wholly or partly
auto-generating. NEa was established to service the cooperatives by mobiliz-
ing funds, providing tichnical assistance, and arranging procurement of common
materials.
1.9      At the end of 1986, the total installed capacity of the Philippine
power subsector was about 6,600 MW, of which 5,788 MW (88?) belonged to NPC
(Annexes 1.01 and 1.02). The major part (41Z) of NPC's capacity is oil-fired,
while geothermal (152), hydro (372), and coal-fired (7?) plants comprise the
rest. Currently, NPC operates 19 oil-fired, 17 hydro, 4 geothermal and 1
coal-fired power plants. Total genexation from NPC facilities was 19.2 kWh in
1986, accounting for about 902 of the Philippines' total generation.  The
residential sector accounted for 23X of electricity sales; the commercial
sector, 22?; industry sector, 502; and the Government, street lighting and
water supply, 5Z. Losses exceeded 20? of gross generation.
1.10     Currently, NPC's facilities are organized into separate systems for
Luzon, the Visayas and Mindanao. Among them, Luzon is the largest. Total
energy sales in 1986 were 17.6 billion kWh from which the Luzon grid accounted
for 76?; Mindanao, 17?; and the Visayas, 7?. The growth of electricity
consumption was well above 15? p.a. in the 1960s and the early 19709.
Following the steep rise in oil prices in 1973, the corresponding increases in
power tariffs reduced the growth rate to 122 p.a. for 1973-79. The slow-down
in the economy further reduced the growth rate to 4.9? p.a. for 1980-86.
Electricity sales in Luzon, which grew during 1980-83 at 4.6?, declined by
4.8? in 1984 and by 0.8? in 1985. A modest rebound of 2.5? and a sharp
increase of 10.5? were experienced in 1985 and 1986 respectively. Growth
rates of 6? and 55? are projected for 1988-90 and 1990-95, respectively.
1.11     Power Sector Investment Program.   The existing generating capacity
in Luzon is 4,100 MW, consisting of 1,925 MW of oil-fired, 1,226 MW of hydro-
power, 660 MW of geothermal, and 300 MW of coal-fired plants. The oil-based
power plants have not been maintained adequately in the past and have deterio-
rated to conditions of poor reliability and low thermal efficiency. However,
the Malaya power plant units No. 1 and 2 (300 MW and 350 MW respectively) are
being rehabilitated and are scheduled to be recommissioned in 1988. Sucat
units No. 1 and 4 (150 MW and 300 MW respectively) are scheduled for rehabili-
tation in 1988-89. Rehabilitation of other units at these plants, however,
must be delayed until some new generating capacity is added so that the system
will have sufficient capacity while the units to be rehabilitated are taken
off line. Thus, the actual capability of the oil-fired power plants is, and
will be, substantially lese than their rated capacity, at least until early
1990s. In addition, from the 660 MW of geothermal power, 220 MW of Tiwi plant
will be retired during 1989-90 due to technical problems related to the steam
supply. Therefore, the total available capacity, after rehabilitation of oil-
fired plants, will be about 3,000 MW. In contrast to installed capacity, the
Luzon grid's current peak demand of 2,500 MW is projected to reach 3,200 MW by
1992. No new generating plant is under contruction despite the (a) projected
increase in load, (b) decrease in installed capacity due to the unexpected



- 5 -
retirement of the geothermal units at Tiwi, and (c) mothballing of the nuclear
plant. As a result, system reliability is expected to fall very sharply; the
loss of load probability (LOLP) is expected to increase from its present level
of 2 days/year to 7 days/year in 1989 and more than 30 days/year in 1991.
1.12     Rectification of this deteriorating situation will require some heavy
investment, precisely at a time when both NPC and the Government are facing
resource mobilization constraints. Short term relief can only be provided
through projects involving low lead time for which substantial financing can
be obtained on attractive terms. Longer term investment decisions need to be
optimized in order that finite available resources can be stretched as far as
possible. In this regard, NPC currently plans to: (a) address peaking
requirements in 1989 and 1990 by installing two gas turbines (150 MW and
200 MW); (b) address base load requirements for 1991 and beyond by
constructing the Bacon Manito geothermai power plant; and (c) address longer
term requirements by optimizing the economic and technical aspects of other
candidate plants and use sound financial practices to develop the optimal
candidates. Although the relative economic merits of geothermal versus
imported coal are not clearly established, the Bacon Manito geothermal plant
is clearly the least-cost option to supply the next increment of base load
generating capacity because of the investment which has already been incurred
in developing the steam production wells; from the total capital cost of
US$73.3 million for geothermal development, more than 702 has already been
expended. The economic viability of other geothermal candidate plants will,
however, need to be investigated in a least-cost framework. In conjunction
with the ongoing Energy Sector Study, the Bank and NPC are conducting a joint
review of NPC's investment program through the year 2000. At negotiations,
NPC agreed that it would review its investment program annually with the Bank.
In conjunction with the Energy Sector Study, the Bank ascertained that NPC was
developing methodologies for investment program formulation that were
satisfactory; therefore, the annual reviews of NPC's investment program could
focus as mtuch on the methods used for investment optimization as on the
constituents of the program.
F. The Geothermal Sector
1.13     The share of geothermal in total energy use has been steadily
increasing during the last five years. In 1979, consultants visited 25 of the
major geothermal manifestations in the Philippines and identified 11 as
priority areas for further investigation. In addition to these 11, explora-
tory drilling is planned or already under way in a number of additional areas;
also, where ongoing geoscientific work is likely to lead to drilling prospects
in still additional areas. Based on exploration to date, the total geothermal
resources of the Philippines are estimated at 8,000 MW. Four fields, Tiwi and
Makiling-Banahaw (MakBan) on Luzon and Tongonan and Palinpinon in the Visayas,
are currently operating and drive a combined generating capacity of 894 MW,
thus ma'ing the Philippines the world's second largest producer of geothermal
energy (after the USA). As of the end of 1986, more than 320 geothermal wells
had been drilled in the Philippines, principally in the four fields under
development; in turn, geological, geophysical and geochemical analyses have
been completed at a number of other sites. But during the period 1984-86,
geothermal exploration and development activity slowed considerably; PNOC-
EDC's drilling activity dropped from 26 wells in 1983 to six in 1984, four in



- 6 -
1985 and one in 1986. Attempts are now being made to accelerate the
exploration and development program and PNOC has proposed a program to drill
171 wells providing an additional 1,290 MW geothermal steam capacity for the
period 1987-1994.
1.14     The first 2.5 kW geothermal power plant on Luzon was put into opera-
tion at Tiwi in 1969 and the first commercial geothermal power station in
Leyte, supplying 3 MW of electricity to Ormoc City, was put into operation in
1977 at Tongonan. Large-scale geothermal power production began in 1979 in
both the Tiwi and MakBan areas, when a 110 MW power station was commissioned
in each area. Currently, Tiwi and MakBan both have 330 MW installed capacity;
both fields are operated by Philippine Geothermal Inc. (PGI) under a service
contract with NPC. PNOC-EDC operates two geothermal fields, both supplyirg
112.5 MW plants, at Tongonan on Leyte and at Palinpinon on Southern Negros.
1.15     Geothermal Exploration and Development.  Geothermal exploration and
development is govez-nsd by Presidential Decree No. 1442 (The Geothermal
Exploration and Development Act, 1978). The terms apply equally to foreign
and local contractors and joint ventures. Contracts were administered earlier
by the Ministry of Energ, through its BED.  With %'he recent constitution,
BED's functions have been transferred to the Office for Energy Operations
within OEA.
1.16     From a resource development perspective, geothermal steam has many
parallels with oil and gas; in the Philippines, they are administered compar-
ably. The basic features of the service contracts previously entered into by
BED for geothermal exploration, drilling and production paralleled those of
petroleum production-sha,.ing segments. Although details may be negotiated and
variations may occur, the contractor must in all cases take all exploration
and development risks, meeting all costs as incurred and recovering those
costs from a share of future production (the contractor's take is a maximum of
401 of net income). The Government's intention was for NPC to purchase the
steam at the "power plant fence" on a cost-related approach, with a firm
contract price based on estimated costs plus a target rate of return. The
service contract is supplemented by two prior contracts for geoscientific
studiess a geophysical survey contract, providing an exclusive right to a
contract area; and a geophysical permit, providing a non-exclusive right to an
area. Foreign companies considering operating in the Philippines generally
regard the contractual arrangements as satisfactory and their relations with
the Government, OEA and PNOC to be good. But world-wide, few companies parti-
cipate in geothermal development and even fewer (less than 10) operate inter-
nationally.
1.17     Difficulties inhibiting further geothermal development have also
arisen because of the need to agree with NPC to a steam price in advance of
commencing exploration, a need arising from both lack of major alternative
uses for steam in most locations and the relatively low initial risk of
failing to find a commercial resource. Almost no international precedents
exist for steam pricing! and further study and contract initiative are needed
to ease and accelerate the contractual process, and to provide for uncertain-
ties which may arise during geothermal field production. In the past, Caltex
and Total had proceeded with basic geothetmal exploration in advance of a
steam contract, and Union Oil has continued on the basis set out in its



existing geothermal license (1970) (Union Oil's license for geothermal
development is different from current practice; it was issued prior to the
Presidential Decree and provides for development to be on a cost-reimbursable
basis to be met from future earnings, but without formal limitations on the
contractor's take); but other interested companies have been extremely
cautious and have not been prepared to undertake even basic exploration in
advance of reaching an agreed steam selling price. PNOC-EDC, as a subsidiary
of a state company, has undertaken exploration in advance of any steam
contract in the interests of national energy development objectives. A number
of highly promising areas, not being explored by PNOC-EDC, are still available
to the private sector; in any case, PNOC-EDC is willing to consider seriously
suitable joint venture proposals. The Government has established within OEA a
special inter-Governmental committee charged with the responsibility to
resolve the steam pricing issue on the basis of the recommendations of a
recent Steam Pricing Study fostered by an existing Bank geothermal project.
G. Bank Lending for the Sector
1.18     Since 1957, the Bank has made nine lending operations (eight loans
and one credit) to the power sector, amounting to US$290.2 million equivalent,
and one for geothermal exploration amounting to US$36 million equivalent.
These lending operations include sever to NPC, for a total amount of US$218.2
million to finance three hyd opower projects, two thermal power plants, and
one transmission project. Apart from considerable slippage in the project
construction schedules and a consequential cost overrun on the fifth and sixth
projects, all projects were completed without major problems and the resultant
facilities are operating satisfactorily. The seventh loan, which was the
Bank's last operation with NPC (1460-PH, US$58 million, 1977) and which
fivanced the expansion of the transmission system in Luzon and construction of
a load dispatching center, was closed in 1985. Bank group lending to the
Philippine power sector has also includeds (a) a loan to NEA for US$60
million in 1978, to help finance the 1979/80 portion of the rural electrifica-
tion program; and (b) a commitment by the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) of US$12 million equi. lent to MERALCO in 1967. The role of geothermal
energy was considered in some detail in the energy assessment undertaken by a
joint World Bank/Asian Development Bank (ADB) mission in 1980 and a project
(Loan 2203-PH, US$36 million, 1982) comprising a 25-well exploration program
at the Bacon Manito and Palinpinon fields, is scheduled for completion in end-
1988. Two of the aforementioned projects have been audited: the Fourth Power
Project (PPAR No. P-0980, January 1976)--a thermal plant at Bataan; and the
Rural Electrification Project (PPAR No. P-5372, June 1985). Both audit
reports identified major problems, such as implementation delays and cost
overruns, and their causes, such as project design changes, cumbersome
contract award procedures and weak project management.
H. Sectoral Issues
1.19     Because solutions to the power sector's problems are so capital
intensive, the prevailing uncertainties in energy sector development and
coordination can have a substantial cost to the economy. The power sector is
now facing a number of issues in the areas of resource allocation and utili-
zation. In the area of resource allocation, the sector needs to optimize
investment, but currently lacks a clear direction regarding the economic



- 8 -
advantages of various sources of supply. This problem became particularly
urgent after the decision to mothball the nuclear plant, which had been
planned to meet all increments of electricity demand in the Luzon grid through
1994/95. Thus, the plant's capacity of 620 MW needs to be replaced with more
conventional power generation. New plants powered by domestic or imported
coal, geothermal steam or hydro resources, as well as rehabilitated existing
oil-fired plants are all feasible fuel alternatives for meetirg future growth
in demand. However, except for the proposed geothermal plant, which is econo-
mically justified based on its incremental cost., the other candidates cannot
be optimized because a reliable basis for cost comparison is lacking. To
resolve this issue, a thorough examination of the development cost of coal,
geothermal and hydro resources, together with a comprehensive analysis of
their economic positions within a consolidated investment program, is needed.
In addition, the option of rehabilitating several existing oil-fired generat-
ing facilities should be weighed against each of the other alternative sources
of capacity expansion.
1.20     Pricina.  Adjacent to the above issue are problems related to steam
and coal pricing. In brief, these resources need to be priced in a way that
reflectt their relative economic merits. Currently, pricing of both resources
is being disputed by concerned entities and has created a bottleneck in NPC's
planning for new, and operation of existing, coal-fired and geothermal power
plants. For NPC and PN0C, the price of geothermal steam must fall between the
cost of production and the 'avoided cost' of using alternative fuels; however,
the specific parameters to be used in the computation of cost of production
and 'avoided cost' must still be developed and agreed between the two parties
before a specific pricing structure can be fixed. An ADB-financed study has
provided an important tool for resolving the issue. It includes a model for
geotherna) steam pricing. The Government has appointed an inter-Governmental
committee to establish a price to cover the steam needed to power the proposed
Bacon Manito project, and to develop a long term steam pricing policy based on
the study. The Bank is expected to assist in (a) providing information on the
most important input into the model, namely the least-cost power development
program, and (b) addressing the financial and fiscal implications of various
pricing policies.
1.21     In addition to optimizing investment programs, NPC and the other
power sector participants need to ensure that they are as efficient as
possible at managing their businesses and producing revenues. In particular,
transmission losses need to be kept at existing levels, distribution losses
need to be reduced, tariff structures need rationalization and the financial
performance of NPC, MERALCO and NEA need substantial improvement.
1.22     Losses.  System losses within Luzon have increased from 142 in 1978
to 242 in 1986. NPC appears to have been effective at controlling transmis-
sion losses; however, distribution losses are excessive and need to be
reduced. MERALCO, which supplies 752 of the total electricity used in Luzon,
by itself recorded losses In excess of 202 in 1986.
1.23     Tariffs.  Rationalization of power tariffs has alreauy received
considerable attention. A tariff study was completed recently; it concluded
that, although average revenue realizable from aggregate electricity sales is
consistent with the average aggregate production and delivery costs, the



-9-
structure of the tariff, as well as the allocation of rates between demand and
energy charges, needs to be altered substantially in order for rates to
reflect efficiently the cost of providing service to each consumer. The
Government has adopted a policy of revising present tariffs to reflect the
marginal cost of power supply and is currently developing guidelines for
changes to both bulk rates and retail tariffs.
1.24     Financial Restructuring.  A number of factors have had a negative
impact on the financial performance of NPC, MERALCO and NEA. These organiza-
tions all have had serious accounts receivable problems; as a result, to meet
some of their working capital requirements, all three have stretched their
accounts payable beyond reasonable limits. All are undercapitalized, with NPC
not being able to raise peso denominated long term loans bearing appropriate
maturities and MERALCO having insufficient paid-in equity capital. This
problem has constrained NPC's cash flows and has affected some of MERALCO's
investment and resource maintenance decisions. NPC, with Government support,
has already implemented measures which would relieve its cash constraints, at
least for the next year or two. MERALCO's problems can only be resolved
through an action program to attract fresh equity capital that will need some
years to implement.
1.25     In discussions regarding the proposed project with the National
Economic Development Authority (NEDA), NPC, PNOC, MERALCO and OEA, all parties
noted that the aforementioned issues needed to be addre3sed within a compre-
hensive and consolidated framework. Accordingly, these organizations
indicated their interest that the Banks (a) provide assistance through the
proposed project to (i; reduce distribution losses, (ii) facilitate the coor-
dination among the concerned entities, especially with regard to geothermal
development and steam pricing, (iii) relieve NPC's cash constraints, and
(iv) rationalize MERALCO's financial structure; and (b) conduct a sector study
aimed at developing an action plan to resolve medium and long term energy
issues. The sector study, initiated in early 1988, would: (a) assess the
geothermal reserves and review the cost estimates of future exploration and
development activities; (b) carry out a technical and economic analysis of
various coal de;elopment schemes; (c) develop a concensus regarding NPC's
least-cost investment program for the period through 2000; (d) propose
guidelines for the pricing of geothermal steam, coal and petroleum products;
(e) review the technical and economic aspects of plant rehabilitation and loss
reduction; and (f) analyze the various instruments available for enhancing the
capitalization of power sector organizations.
I. Rationale for Bank Involvement
1.26     The efficient development of the Philippine power sector requires
close cooperation and coordination among the principal parties--NPC as the
generator and wholesaler of power, PNOC as the primary supplier of fuels to
NPC, and the major private and public distribution franchisees. Through its
past operational involvement, the Bank has developed constructive relation-
ships that enable it to facilitate important interactions between NPC, PNOC
and PNOC-EDC. The Bank can play a significant role in resolution of issues
such as coal and steam pricing, and on the consequent analysis of investment
strategies. The sector's institutions all have considerable scope for
improvement of operational performance, financial stability and investment

planning. The project would afford the Bank an opportunity to assist NPC and
MERALCO in implementing financial recovery measures. Finally, by using Bank
procedures for procurement, the real cost of investment in the project can be
optimized. The Government is keenly interested in the Bank's continued
involvement in a sector which is critical for the country's industrialization.
II. THE PROJECT
A. Background
2.1      Several Bank missions during 1984-86 reviewed with NPC, PNOC and
PNOC-EDC the development of the power and geothermal sectors in Philippines.
An examination of NPC's least cost power development program indicates that
development of a 110 MW power plant at Bacon Manito in southern Luzon should
be NPC's next development priority. PNOC has already invested US$51.5 million
in developing the Bacon Manito geothermal steam field to sustain a production
level of 70 MW and needs an incremental investment of about US$24 million to
upgrade the field to 110 MW. To optimize the efficiency of investments in
generation, there is a need to upgrade and expand the facilities of NPC's
system.
B. Proiect Objectives
2.2      The main objectives of the project are to:
(a) support the delineation and assessment of geothermal resources for
use in Luzon, and thereby reduce the need to rely on imported fuel
for power generation;
(b) develop an existing geothermal steam field at Bacon Manito I and an
associated 110 MW base load power plant that would provide a new
source to meet demand growth in the Luzon grid;
(c) support measures for upgrading and expanding NPC's system facilities;
and
(d) support institution-building and financial recovery efforts at NPC
during this critical stage of the economic recovery period.
C. Proiect Description
2.3      The project includes the following components:
(a) Geothermal Steam Exploitation and Distribution
(i) development of the Bacon Manito I geothermal field including
drilling of additional production and injection wells, and
engineering, procurement, installation and commissioning of the
steam-gathering system;



- 11 -
(ii) delineation/appraisal of geothermal sites for power supply to
the Luzon grid. This includes drilling of about 18 wells to an
average depth of 2,800 meters, and studies for assessing the
extent of geothermal resources and the feasibility of their
development.
(b) Power Plant and Associated Transmission System
(i) construction of the 2 x 55 MW Bacon Manito geothermal power
plant including turbine generators, auxiliary equipment, steam

- 12 -
(f) establishing feasibility of the latest techniques in the
construction of hydro-electric dams.
2.4      Development of Bacon Manito Geothermal Field.  The first reconnais-
sance survey of the Bacon Manito geothermal field, located about 600 km south
of Manila in southern Luzon, was started in May 1977 by PNOC and Geothermal
Energy of New Zealand, Ltd. During 1977-85, PNOC carried out detailed
geophysical, geological and geochemical studies and delineated a geothermal
field, about 10 sq. km. In Bacon Manito, a total of 24 wells have already
been drilled and only three additional wells are needed to complete the
production and reinjection requirements of the 110 MW plant. Of the total
wells drilled, only 16 are presently hookable to the steam-gathering system,
while four wells could be used in the future for power on a modular concept.
The current production capacity is 102.5 MW, and the additional wells will
enable attainment of the plant rated capacity of 110 MW, plus an additional 10
MW reserve capacity. An independent resource assessment completed in 1985
concluded that the site has reserves sufficient to supply a 110 MW power plant
for 25 years. This conclusion has been confirmed by an independent expert,
who assisted the Bank in 1987. The project component includes the drilling of
additional three wells so as to develop the first section of the Bacon Manito
geothermal field, and construction of the required steam-gathering system.
The steam-gathering system (SGS) is comprised of a piping network, three
separator stations, cross-country steamlines and reinjection lines. The SGS,
designed to drive as a base load station, although provisions for load peaking
will be included, will have a fully automatic control system with a secondary
provision for full blow-off capacity to take care of major plant operating
upsets.
2.5      Delineation and Appraisal of Geothermal Sites for the Supply of Power
to the Luzon Grid. Geoscientific studies, including geological, geophysical
and geochemical studies, will be conducted to identify appropriate locations
and targets for drilling operations. The project includes the drilling of 19
confirmatory wells on the basis of the above geoscientific studies and/or
based on results of drilling already undertaken earlier. Three wells will be
drilled to an average depth of 2,800 - 3,000 meters to complete the eight
wells that are necessary to define an area for a 110 MW development at Bacon
Manito II, including both the production and reinjection wells; five wells
with an average depth of 2,800 - 3,000 meters which will be drilled in
Pinatubo are necessary to complete the ten wells required to delineate a
resource area capable of sustaining a 110 MW development; and approximately
ten wells will be drilled to an average depth of 2,800 - 3,000 meters in one
or more of the following areass Del Gallego, Mariveles Natib, and Greater
Leyte area to confirm the resource potential of the chosen area. On
completion of geoscientific surveys and drilling, studies of geothermal
resource and feasibility of development will be carried out. An independent
resource assessment and feasibility study by an internationally reputed
organization will confirm and establishs (a) the existence of an exploitable
geothermal resource sufficient to support a first stage development of up to
110 MW on two sites; and (b) the future drilling and development plans.
2.6      Bacon Manito Geothermal Power Plant.  A feasibility report detailing
the parameters of the Bacon Manito geothermal power plant has been prepared by



- 13 -
NPC, and a site for the power plant has already been selected. The project
construction includes a power house installed with two 55 MW generating units,
auxiliary equipment and controls, steam condensing and gas extraction systems
and the cooling water system including cooling towers. Power from the genera-
tors would be sterped up to 230 kV by transformers leading to an adjacent gas
insulated metalclad 230 kV switching station. A 10 km long 230 kV double
circuit transmission line will convey power to the nearest 230 kV switching
station at Daraga and thence to Manila by the 500 kV EHV system currently
under construction. The project would provide the Luzon grid with a source of
additional firm energy of about 800 GWh annually from 1991/92.
2.7      Upgrading and Expansion of NPC's System Facilities.  To meet the
projected increases in power demands in its Luzon, Mindanao and Visayas grids,
NPC has formulated a sizeable investment program (US$6,337 million equivalent
over the period 1989-1995) to strengthen its system facilities. This program
envisages construction of new transmission lines and substations, augmentation
of transforming and reactive control capacity at existing substations and
rehabilitation of transmission lines and substation equipment. For more
efficient system operation, NPC plans to extend its communication facilities
and enhance its management information system. A portion of NPC's investment
program for the 1989-91 period is expected to be financed by an ADB's power
sector loan currently under appraisal. The proposed project includes compo-
nents (para. 2.4(c)) which would complement the ADB project.
2.8      Extension of NPC's Communication System.  The Luzon-Visayas-Mindanao
microwave link, which will establish an integrated communication network for
NPC, will provide communication channels needed among the NPC offices in
Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao. The channels will be used to transmit data
(computer, telex, facsimile) and voice information between the regional
offices and the head office. This will also allow communication between the
different plants, substations and offices of NPC and will contribute to an
efficient and effective operation and management of the corporation. The
existing microwave system will be extended to the south from Kalayaan to Tiwi
and to the north from La Trinidad to San Esteban. Power Line Carrier (PLC)
equipment will be used to replace equipment which was installed and commis-
sioned a decade ago and provide for expansion of PLC channels to plants/sub-
stations that cannot be reached via microwave. The upgrading of the microwave
system in Luzon will provide the communication channels needed for improved
high voltage transmission line protection, supervisory control and data acqui-
sition (SCADA) computer terminals of plants/substations, centralized sequence-
of-event recording (SER), telephone, telex, facsimile and other communication
facilities required in plants, substations and offices. Microwave and PLC
equipment will be used to establish a communication network among the islands
of Visayas. The communication channels will be used for telephone, telex and
facsimile, transmission line protections, SCADA, centralized SER and computer
terminals.
2.9      Enhancement of NPC's MIS.  With the rapid power expansion program of
the 70s, information systems did not evolve to match NPC's growth. In 1982,
NPC engaged Computer Information Systems (a subsidiary of MERALCO) to formu-
late its MIS plan. This plan envisaged development of 43 MIS software modules
and installation of a total of 27 computers for major offices and plants.
Currently, NPC has three Burroughs mainframes for commercial work and a VAX



- 14 -
computer for engineering applications. While NPC has made substantial
progress in the implementation of the Materials Management and Project
Management Information systems, considerable work still needs to be done for
the Financial Management, Maintenance Management and Administrative
Information Systems. In order to complete the MIS System Plan, NPC needs to
purch4se additional hardware and software including four mainframe computers
and eight minicomputers, software, and consulting assistance for the
Maintenance Management and Project Management systems. The four mainframes
will serve as regional computers whereas the eight minicomputers will handle
Maintenance and Materials Management systems at eight major power plants.
2.10     Consultancy Studies.  Draft terms of reference for all the studies,
including cost estimates, are presented in Annex 2.15. These drafts were
discussed and confirmed at negotiations.
(a) Establishing the feasibility of transmitting power from Leyte to
Luzon. This study will determine the feasibility of transmittine
large blocks of power (500-1200 MW) from the Tongonan Geothermal
Project in Leyte to the Luzon grid over a distance of 460 km (23 km
submarine). The study will consider a.c. versus d.c. transmission
and establish the least cost technically feasible transmission
option. The feasibility study carried out in Phase 1 will be
followed by engineering studies and preparation of procurement
documents in Phase 2. This study is estimated to require 70 man-
months of consultancy services.
(b) Tongonan Geothermal Power Plant Siting and Development. This study
will determine the least cost technically feasible alternative for
siting, sizing and interconnection of power plants in the vast
geothermal steam complex at Tongonan. This study is estimated to
require 30 man-months of consultancy services.
(c) Establishing the feasibility of transmission interconnections to the
Islands of Masbate, Mindoro, Marinduquie, Romblon, Catanduanes and
Basilan. This study will determine the feasibility of transmitting
electricity from the mainland grids to the nearby islands mentioned
above, thus mitigating the need for expensive local diesel power
generation on the islands. The feasibility study carried out under
Phase 1 will be followed by engineering studies and preparation of
procurement documents under Phase 2. This study is expected to
require 70 man-months of consultancy services.
(d) Developing cost estimating techniques for power system components and
a computerized data base. This study will establish techniques for
estimating the cost of major power system components such as thermal
power plants, hydroelectric power plants, transmission lines,
substations and civil works. The study which will be followed by
preparation of a computerized data base and a cost estimated manual
will assist NPC in major planning exercises for power system
development. This study is expected to require 25 man-months of
consultancy services.



- 15 -
(e) Developing norms for the cost of power supply outages. This study
will establish norms for the determination of cost of power supply
outages in the various grids of PNC, which would assist NPC in
developing its future generation expansion plans. This study is
expected to require 25 man-months of consultancy services.
(f) Establishing feasibility of the latest techniques in the construction
of hydroelectric dams. This study will determine the applicability
of latest techniques in dam construction in the Philippines with
particular reference to the application of Roller Compacted Concrete.
The study will review in detail the design of seven prospective
hydroelectric dams and recommend the most cost-effective construction
techniques. This study is expected to require 25 man-months of
consultancy services.
D. Project Costs
2.11     The total project cost is estimated at US$216.3 million excluding
interest during construction, of which about US$147.5 million is expected to
be in foreign exchange. A summary of project cost is shown below in Table 2.1
for the two agencies executing the project.

2.12      Annexes 2.02 and 2.03 give detailed cost estimates for the project
components for PNOC-EDC and NPC, respectively. All costs are based on
December 1987 prices; physical contingencies are at 10X. Cost estimates for
the Bacon Manito geothermal power plant are estimated based on budgetary
estimates obtained by NPC in mid-1987. Price escalation for costs expressed
in terms of foreign exchange (US dollars) is calculated according to
anticipated international price movements of 1.0Z for 1988-90, and 3.5? for
1991 and thereafter. Price escalation for costs expressed in local currency



- 17 -
is calcul..ted according to projected local inflation :at.es of 6.5Z for 1988-90
and 8.02 for 1991 and thereafter. The cost estimates assume that exchange
rate adjustments would, on average, maintain "purchasing power parity' during
the project implementation period.
E. Financina Plan

A protocol soft loan being offered by the Government of Italy will finance the
foreign cost and a portion of local cost for the Bacon Manito power station.
At negotiations the Government of Italy indicated the expectation that this
protocol loan would become effective not later than December 31, 1988. Two
Bank loans will cover the proposed project's remaining foreign exchange
requirements, including interest during construction. The remaining expendi-
tures will be financed by PNOC-EDC and NPC using internal cash generation.
US$41 million would be lent to PNOC (PNOC Loan) for 20 years, including five
years of grace on repayment of principal, at the standard variable interest
rate. PNOC would relend the proceeds of that loan to PNOC-EDC on the same
terms and conditions as the PNOC Loan, and PNOC-EDC would bear the foreign
exchange risk. Execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, satisfactory to the
Bank, between PNOC and PNOC-EDC would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
US$59 million would be lent to NPC (NPC Loan) at the standard variable
interest rate for 20 years, including five years of grace on repayment of
principal.
2.14     The aggregate amount of the proposed Bank loans is US$100 million
equivalent. The Republic of the Philippines will guarantee the two Bank
loans.
F. Proiect Imnlementation and Schedule
2.15     In order that the two separate organizations involved in project
implementation coordinate their activities in the most effective manner, NPC
and PNOC-EDC have formed a Project Implementation Committee, consisting of the
relevant managers of each of the two implementing organizations. This
committee has functions and powers agreed by all parties; a draft of those
terms of refereace is given in Annex 2.04. At negotiations, NPC and PNOC-EDC



- 18 -
indicated that each will comply with such functions and powers for the Project
Implementation Committee as are satisfactory to these two organizations and to
the Bank.
2.16     DNOC-EDC will have overall responsibility for implementing the geo-
thermal component of the project. It is organized in four technical operaLing
groups (Annex 2.05) composed of highly capable technical and professional
staff whio have gained extensive experience in geothermal technology from the
Philippines experience, as well as training extended through various bilateral
agreements with New Zealand, Iceland, Italy, Japan and USA. PNOC-EDC will
continue to retain Kingston, Reynolds, Thom and Allardyce (KRTA), New Zealand,
to provide experienced staff to assist them in the specialized areas of geo-
sciences, drilling, production and system engineering through the project
duration for an estimated 28 man-months.  For the development of the Bacon
Manito I steam-gathering system, PNOC-EDC agreed at negotiations to appoint a
consultant to provide support for project execution services. In addition,
PNOC-EDC agreed that, after completion of appraisal ard delineation drilling
at prospective geothermal sites, it will retain an independent consultant for
study of resource assessment and techno-economics of field development. The
terms of reference for these studies shall be drawn up in consultation with
the Bank on completion of the drilling program at each site. The project is
based on a detailed feasibility study prepared by PNOC-EDC, in consultation
with KRTA, and verified independently by NPC. The overall engineering design
has been developed by PNOC-EDC after optimization studies have been carried
out in consultation with NPC. The detailed engineering will also be revie-qed
by KRTA before the end of 1987.  The corporate structure for undertakirg
drilling, as well as development activities, already exists with PNOC-EDC, who
have carried out similar works successfully in the past at Palinpinon and
Tongonan. The project will be executed through a project team constituted for
this purpose (Annex 2.06). The 21 wells under the proposed project would be
drilled by PNOC-EDC. PNOC Energy Drilling Inc. (PNOC-EDI), the drilling
subsidiary of PNOC, which has drilled over 100 geothermal wells and 10 oil and
gas wells in a technically efficient and cost effective manner, has recently
been made a part of PNOC-EDC. The PNOC-EDC drilling crews will use their own
rigs and staff, while all other drilling equipment, materials and services
will be obtained from the international market as needed. Implementation of
the steam-gathering system will be procured through seven contracts for the
purchase of materials and services and a single installation-cum-erection
contract.
2.17     NPC will have overall responsibility for implementing the power
generation and transmission lines component of the project. NPC has carried
out an indepth feasibility study of the Bacon Manito geothermal power plant,
and has prepared the specifications, drawings and bid documents for procuring
the entire power plant including civil works on a single responsibility basis.
NPC has also prepared the bid documents for the transmission lines and substa-
tions. Having been associated with the design, construction and operation of
the Tiwi and MakBan geothermal plants, which have six 110 MW units, the staff
of NPC has the experience and capability to undertake the pToposed project
without outside assistance. Detailed designs and drawings for the power plant
which will be produced by the contractor, will be reviewed by NPC's engineers
to ensure compliance with the specifications. NPC's field staff will provide
necessary supervision and exercise quality control over the contractor's



- 19 -
activities during construction, testing and commissioning. The proposed NPC's
organization which will function exclusively for implementation of the Bacon
Manito geothermal plant is shown in Annex 2.07 and is considered to be
adequate. The project manager and other key staff have already been
appointed. NPC also has in-house capability for designing, engineering and
implementing the other project components including the transmission lines and
substations, communication, instrumentation ar4 control systems, with engage-
ment of local civil works and erection contractors as necessary to supplement
NPC's own forces. Limited consultancy assistance will be needed for the
maintenance management system of the MIS; the overall design of the latter has
already been formulated.
2.18     Implementation Schedule.  Annex 2.08 gives the critical activities in
the implementation schedule of the Bacon Manito geothermal power plant.
Annex 2.09 gives the implementation schedule for installation and erection of
the steam-gathering system for Bacon Manito I, and for the drilling program
for the delineation-cum-appraisal component of the project. The commissioning
of the steam-gathering system is scheduled to be completed by the middle of
1991. The 21 wells to be drilled under the project are scheduled to be
completed by the first quarter of 1990. Annex 2.10 gives the implementation
schedule for the NPC component of the project. The first 55 MW unit is
scheduled to be commissioned by April 1991 and the second unit by July 1991.
The associated transmission system will be available on time for evacuation of
power from the first unit. The system upgrading and expansion components are
projected to be completed by 1991. The entire project is scheduled for
completion by end 1991.

- 21 -
2.20     Equipment and services financed under the proposed Bank loans would
be procured by International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance with the
Bank's Procurement Guidelines except as noted in paras. 2.21, 2.22 and 2.23
below. The power plant will be procured on a single responsibility turnkey
basis from an Italian firm. For all ICB procurement, local manufacturers will
be permitted to participate where appropriate and, at PNOC-EDC's and NPC's
option, will be eligible for a preference of 15Z of the CIP cost of the
imported goods or the prevailing customs duties and other import taxes,
whichever is lower, in the evaluation of bids. All essential procurement
documentation for goods and services financed by the Bank and estimated to
cost over US$1 million equivalent will be subject to the Bank's prior review.
Procurement packages valued at approximately 80Z of the loan amount are likely
to be reviewed.
2.21     All major packages of materials, equipment and services for PNOC-EDC
shall be procured via ICB, except for the followings
(a) Contracts for services and equipment needed for well-related opera-
tions, e.g., cementing, directional drilling, pipe inspection and
other highly specialized operations available only from a limited
number of suppliers which do not exceed in the aggregate the equi-
valent of US$4,000,000, may be awarded in accordance with Limited
International Biddings (LIB) procedures. All qualified bidders will
be invited to bid on these packages.
(b) Contracts for equipment and materials that are proprietary or to
ensure standardization and compatibility with existing equipment and
facilities which do not exceo.d, in the aggregate, the equivalent of
US$1,000,000 may be procured by direct contracting under terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank.
(c) Approximately US$16.8 million for drilling of wells on force account
basis using PNOC-EDC's own drilling rigs and crews; these items will
not be financed by the Bank loan.
2.22     Minor packages for equipment, spare parts, materials, consumables and
services (not exceeding US$200,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of
US$3 million for NPC and US$2 million for PNOC), may be procured in accordance
with local competitive bidding procedures which have been reviewed by the
Bank, and are considered acceptable to the Bank, or international shopping
procedures based on comparing price quotations from at least three qualified
suppliers.
2.23     Conductors for NPC's transmission lines will be fabricated locally
following LCB procedures from ingots procured through ICB. The local condu%.-
tor manufacturing industry is efficient and this mode of procurement is not
expected to affect satisfactory implementation of the project in terms of
cost, efficiency and completion time. Local fabrication of conductors will
not be financed from the Bank loan. Poles for transmission lines and civil
works for substations and transmission lines will be procured locally through
LCB procedures. These procedures are acceptable to the Bank.
2.24     The major packages for procurement on the project are shown in
Annex 2.11.



- 22 -
2.25     Consulting services financed under the Bank loan would be engaged in
accordance with the Bank Guidelines for the use of consultants.
2.26     Retroactive financing would be permitted to the extent of US$2 mil-
lion equivalent for payments made after March 31, 1988 by NPC, and US$1
million for payments made after March 31, 1988 by PNOC-EDC to cover advanced
contracting for materials and services.
H. Disbursements
2.27     The Bank loan would be disbursed against (a) 1002 of the foreign
expenditures of directly imported equipment and materials; (b) 100? of local
expenditures ex-factory of locally manufactured items procured through ICB;
(c) 502 of local expenditure for materials and works procured locally;
(d) 100? of total expenditures for consulting services; and (e) for fuel,
disbursement would be made against 502 of cost (the estimated foreign exchange
component) and, for imported goods procured locally (e.g., chemicals), 80? of
the cost.
2.28     Reimbursements of expenditures relating to contracts valued at less
than US$200,000 equivalent would be made on the basis of statements of expen-
ditures (SOEs). Documentation supporting the SOEs need not be submitted to
the Bank but should be retained by PNOC-EDC and NPC and made available for
review by the Bank supervision missions. To facilitate project disbursements,
a Special Account in a fully convertible currency will be established in a
bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank for each agency. The
authorized allocation to the Special Account will be US$4 million for NPC and
US$2 million for PNOC-EDC, representing four months, average project
expenditure. Replenishments to the Special Account would be made quarterly or
whenever the account is drawn down by about 50? of the initial deposit. The
standard procedure for auditing SOEs will apply.
2.29     Annexes 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 give the disbursement schedules for the
proposed Bank loan for the project, PNOC-EDC and NPC, respectively. There is
no information available on typical disbursement profiles for similar power
projects in Philippines, no meaningful comparison can be made in that respect.
However, the disbursement schedules up to the year 1993 for the NPC components
are in line with the Bank's profile of disbursements for power projects in the
East Asian region and the PNOC-EDC component is expected to be fully disbursed
by 1991. The closing date would be Deoember 31, 1993.
I. Monitoring and Reporting
2.30     Satisfactory procedures for monitoring the progress of the project in
terms of physical execution and financial reports have been agreed. PNOC-EDC
and NPC will furnish quarterly progress reports. At negotiations, PNOC-EDC
agreed to furnish annually to the Bank its exploration program for the next
year for areas covered by the project.



- 23 -
J. Environment
2.31     The potential environmental problems of steam field development and
operation are taken very seriously by PNOC and NPC, who wish to avoid environ-
mental damage. At Bacon Manito and other sites, maximum use would be made of
directional drilling, which would minimize the amount of land to be levelled.
Flow testing operations are planned so as to restrict the temporary discharge
of geothermal fluid to the amount capable of being carried by local streams
without permanent harm, and testing would be deferred rather than permitting
fluid to exceed that level. Operational effluent would be reinjected. Safety
procedures have been designed for each well, and appropriate industry
practices are followed regarding disposal of fluids recovered in tests,
borehole cuttings, and other waste materials normal to drilling operations.
2.32     There are very few inhabitants in the immediate area of the proposed
power plant, the vegetation is sparse and there is little wildlife. Special
attention has been given to the problem of hydrogen sulphide in the design of
the system so as to eliminate unventilated areas, and deep pits or trenches
where the gas may accumulate. Disposal of gases would normally be through a
24 m high stack which has been designed to provide adequate dispersion and
dilution so as to conform with recommended allowable ground level concentra-
tion. The ground level concentration of H2S will be kept below 20 parts per
billion (Philippine National Standard) in the plant areas. Further, a sensi-
tive HBS monitoring system will be installed to give alarm and shut down the
plant in the event H2S concentrations exceed specified levels. Periodically,
it would be necessary to blow off steam for pressure stabilization and well
maintenance, but with suitable protection the noise would be within acceptable
limits for the operators, who would normally be stationed in an air-
conditioned control room. Housing of the operating staff would be located
some distance away so that objectionable gases would be diffused and seldom
reach the area, and the noise level much reduced. Waste water containing
large quantities of salts would be reinjected to the reinjection wells where
the water would seep deep into the ground.
2.33     Transmission lines will be designed to international practices and
will have no adverse impact on the environment. Within the urban areas, high
voltage lines will be run on poles meeting necessary safety codes. Substa-
tions in built-up areas will be indoors depending on availability of space.
2.34     The Environmental Management Bureau has granted an Environmental
Compliance Certificate for the proposed Bacon Manito Geothermal Power Project
based on compliance with the Environmental Impact Assessment. The Certificate
is issued subject to the project authorities ensuring (a) that Boron and
Arsenic discharge do not exceed the levels set by the National Pollution
Control Commission (NPCC), and that this is adequately monitored; (b) H2S
emissions are kept within acceptable limits and H2S control facilities are
installed according to the specifications set forth in the Environmental
Impact Statement, and that continuous monitoring of H2S is effected; (c) noise
levels are kept within NPCC set levels and (d) monitoring of water quality in
affected river systems is institutionalized. NPC and PNOC-EDC have furnished
to the Bank updated environmental reports showing that they have incorporated
the design parameters needed to enable compliance with the regulations of the
Environmental Management Board and with environmental standards satisfactory
to the Bank.

III. THE BORROWERS AND THE BENEFICIARY
3.1      The Borrowers of the two separate Bank loans will be the National
Power Corporation (NPC) and the Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC). In
turn, PNOC's subsidiary, the Energy Development Corporation (PNOC-EDCI will be
the Beneficiary of the loan to PNOC. These entities are large corporations
with occasionally contiguous, though dissimilar operations. This chapter will
present separate institutional analyses for each of the two Borrowers and the
Beneficiary.
A. NPC
3.2      NPC was established in 1936 as a non-stock public corporation with a
mandate to develop hydroelectric power generating facilities. In 1960, NPC
was converted into a stock corporation with all shares subscrlbed by the
Government. NPC's charter, which was issued in 1971 and was amended there-
after by several Presidential Decrees, expanded its mandate into the develop-
ment, construction and operation of all electric power generation and trans-
mission facilities throughout the country. Since 1979, the National
Electrification Administration (NEA) is empowered to authorize electric power
cooperatives to construct and operate generating plants of less than 5 MW. In
July 1987, the Government issued an amendment to Presidential Decree No. 40,
allowing the private sector to construct and operate electric generating
plants and sell their production to grids where they exist and to end users
where grids do not exist.
3.3      Organization, Management and Staff.  NPC's corporate powers are
exercised by its seven-member Board of Directors. The present NPC Board,
which consists mostly of businessmen, was appointed by the Presidelit of the
Republic in July 1986. Appointments are normally for five years, and contain
the possibility of reappointment. NPC's management is vested in its President
who is Chief Executive of the Corporation; the incumbent is normally appointed
by the President of the Republic.
3.4      NPC's organization chart is presented in Annex 3.01.  In 1985, the
Corporation underwent a major reorganization that had the objectives of (a)
consolidating operations and construction, (b) decentralizing those functions,
and (c) placing responsibility for them in the regional centers under the
supervision of regional Vice Presidents. In view of the large and geographi-
cally fragmented nature of NPC's system and the often difficult communications
between headquarters and the field, NPC operates as three separate businesses;
therefore, the decentralized structure is appropriate for NPC.
3.5      A profile of NPC's staff, allocated according to function is presen-
ted in Annex 3.02. In conjunction with its reorganization, after redeploying
personnel with fungible skills from units that were streamlined, NPC reduced
its staff from about 11,500 to about 10,600 in early-1986. Most of the cut-
backs were effected in the construction department, which was reduced by about
652 because of a retrenchment in the scope of NPC's in-house construction
activities. As of mid-1987, NPC had 11,300 approved positions, of which about
10,200 were filled by permanent staff and the remainder with temporaries.



- 25 -
3.6      Training.  NPC has an ample in-house training program.  In the past,
this program has focused on orientation for new employees and skills develop-
ment for technicians, equipment operators, and other specialized workers. In
relation to the reorganization, NPC promoted to newly created management posi-
tions many employees lacking previous managerial experience; to develop
quickly the effectiveness of these new managers, NPC devised a separate in-
house training curriculum emphasizing basic managerial techniques, systems and
procedures. NPC also arranges with other centers in the Philippines for
deserving staff to acquire training in relevant topics not covered in its in-
house program. These training arrangements are appropriate.
3.7      Operations. Maintenance and Losses.  Although NPC appears to have
large capacity margins, especially in Luzon, much of its aging plant and
equipment cannot be operated at rated capacity. NPC has operated and
maintained its assets satisfactorily, especially in view of the age and mix of
its plant, the geographic dispersion of its systems, and the resource
constraints of recent years. Many of the NPC system improvement measures
included in the proposed project are expected to enable better fut're stan-
dards of operation and maintenance. In recent years, NPC's combined line
losses and station use have averaged between 7-8X of energy sold, a level
appropriate to NPC's current circumstances.
3.8      Accounting System.  NPC's accouating system is based on accepted
power utility principles and procedures. It was modeled after the Uniform
System of Accounts prescribed for public utilities by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission of the United States of America, and adapted to suit
local conditions and requirements.
3.9      Financial Planning and Budgeting.  NPC has well staffed units for
financial planning and budgeting. The financial planning unit has developed
several computerized financial models, which are used primarily for reporting
to the Government. These financial plans are also used for evaluating invest-
ment alternatives and providing necessary information to financiers. NPC
prepares budgets annually according to Government practice. The budget is
revised periodically during the year and comparisons of actual performance
against budget is a regular managerial exercise.
3.10     Commercial Systems.  As of July 31, 1987, NPC had 245 power
customers. MERALCO, which accounts for more than 502 of both sales and
consumption, is by far the largest.   Other customers include a handful of
small investor-owned utilities, about 115 electrical cooperatives, a few
public sector consumers (armed forces installations and municipal utilities),
and industrial operations with loads greater than 69 kV. None among these
other customers predominates the rest.
3.11     In the past, NPC has had severe problems collecting from MERALCO, the
cooperatives, and Government sector consumers (para. 4.6). Many of these
customers were experiencing difficulty in realizing collections from their own
Government sector customers and were stretching their payables to their
largest Government sector creditors. To assist NPC inter alia, the Government
decided to use a clearing-house approach for settling some transactions
between public sector organizations. This enabled power retailers to turn



- 26 -
verifiable receivables from national Government consume s over to NPC; in
turn, NPC could collect the amounts due directly from the Treasury. In addi-
tion, the Government has authorized NPC to toughen its disconnection of coope-
ratives. NPC has recently disconnected several cooperatives; as a result,
many cooperatives have sought to reschedule their arrears while paying their
current obligations on time (or making strictly enforced prior arrangements
for late payments). As of post-appraisal, NPC had concluded negotiations with
MERALCO for a rescheduling of arrears; this agreement includes severe penal-
ties for late payment of current bills as well as amortization of rescheduled
arrears. Although NPC cannot per se disconnect MERALCO, it can apply
judicious penalties to ensure prompt payments. This combination of measures
should enable NPC to improve its commercial operations (para. 4.6).
3.12     To cope with its own collection problems, NPC stretched its accounts
payable to its largest Government sector creditor, PNOC. In connection with
the transfer of nuclear plant assets and liabilities, the Government is
assuming responsibility for NPC's arrears to PNOC. In the future, with
improved collection of receivables, NPC expects to stay current with all its
creditors, including PNOC (para. 4.6).
3.13     Audit.  The Commission on Audits (COA) maintains a large staff at
NPC's premises year round. Much of Its activities center on pre-audit reviews
of contracts and transactions. This activity has enabled COA to complete an
annual audit of NPC's accounts within three to four months of the end of each
financial year. COA's audits have generally been satisfactory. The audits
themselves have emphasized reviews of transactions and verifications of
accounts. During supervision of the proposed project, the Bank plans to
discuss with COA broader parameters for reviewing NPC's accounting policies
and practices. At negotiations, NPC agreed that, by June 30 of each year, it
will furnish to the Bank audited financial statements for the previous year,
together with the certification and long form report prepared by an acceptable
auditor.
3.14     NPC has an internal audit department.  This unit has broad responsi-
bilities; yet, its primary activities involve reviewing blocks of transac-
tions. For the future, this department is developing procedures for auditing
the inputs to the computerized accounting system. This would fill an impor-
tant gap in existing audit arrangements.
3.15     Taxes.  NPC is not currently liable for income tax.  It is exempt
from customs duties on imports financed from official sources but not on
commercially funded imports. Net interest income is taxed at 20X.
3.16     Insurance.  NPC insures its assets through a combination of self-
insurance and commercially purchased policies. At appraisal, these practices
were reviewed and found satisfactory. Recently, NPC began to study the estab-
lishment of its own risk management unit. This would have the salutary effect
of optimizing its expenditures on insurance.
B. PNOC and PNOC-EDC
3.17     While PNOC-EDC is the direct beneficiary of the PNOC Loan, it cannot
be analyzed independently of PNOC, its holding company. Both institutions
are, therefore, discussed below.



- 27 -
PNOC
3.18     In 1973, the Government created PNOC to ensure the security and
adequacy of the country's oil supply. In 1976, its responsibilities were
extended to include development of all indigenous energy resources. Under
this mandate, PNOC has arranged the supply of crude oil with several oil
exporting countries and is using its five ocean-going tankers for transporting
virtually all of its oil imports. PNOC owns and operates the largest oil
refinery in the Philippines (155,000 barrels per stream day capacity) and
manages about 692 of all inter-island transport of oil product using its own
fleet of coastal tankers, tugboats, barges and floating pump stations. In the
aggregate, PNOC serves nearly 37? of the domestic petroleum market, with
Caltex and Shell sharing the rest. Through its 15 subsidiaries, PNOC is also
engaged in every major facet of developing the country's indigenous geother-
mal, coal, and gas resources, including the services required to support these
activities. The Government continues, however, to maintain an open door
policy aimed at attracting private sector participation in oil, coal and geo-
thermal exploration. Recently, in conjunction with this policy, the
Government asked PNOC to develop a program to privatize its coal and shipyard
activities.
3.19     Organization and Management.  PNOC functions autonomously; it reports
to the President of the Republic through the Office of Energy Affairs (OEA).
PNOC's corporate powers are exercised by its six-member Board of Directors,
which includes a part-time Chairman, a full-time President, and four part-time
members drawn from the public sector. The Chairman and the President function
concurrently as the Chairman and President of each of the subsidiary
companies. The parent company provides the subsidiaries with commonly needed
services such as cash management, planning and budgeting, legal services,
public relations and personnel policies. PNOC's organization chart is shown
in Annex 3.03.
3.20     Budgeting.  PNOC's budgeting and financial control activities are
well developed. Reviews of expenditures vis-a-vis budgets are conducted
periodically at the different management levels.
3.21     Accounting and Audit.  PNOC and its subsidiaries use an accounting
system based on accepted commercial principles; the standard international
practices being followed are conservative (for example, abandoned prospects
for oil, coal and steam development are expensed in PNOC's accounts in the
year of abandonment). Accounts of both the parent company and the subsidia-
ries were audited by independent private auditors until 1986; since then, COA
has taken over the auditing responsibilities. In this regard, COA conducts
selective pre-audits and concentrates on the validation of transactions.
These arrangements are satisfactory. PNOC agreed to provide the Bank with
audited financial statements, together with the certification and long form
report of an acceptable auditor, within six months of the conclusion of PNOC's
financial year. This report would include statements concerning (i) the
holding company by itself; (ii) the holding company consolidated with all
subsidiaries; and (iii) all subsidiaries separately.



- 28 -
3.22     Insurance.  PNOC insures its assets with the Government Services
Insurance Systems (GSIS). GSIS, in turn, reinsures wells under drilling with
commercial carriers. Contractors maintain the necessary insurance for ongoing
construction.  These arrangements are satisfactory.
PNOC-EDC
3.23     PNOC-EDC was established as a wholly-owned subsidiary of PNOC in
1976.   PNOC-EDC operates, however, as an independent entity, coordinating its
activities closely with PNOC. Currently, PNOC-EDC is heavily dependent on the
parent company for financial support through inter-company advances. By 1994,
with the completion of its current development program and increased commer-
cial production of steam, PNOC-EDC expects not only to be repaying its borrow-
ings from PNOC regularly, but also to be declaring substantial dividends. In
the late 1970s, PNOC-EDC discovered steam fields in Tongonan (Leyte) and
Palinpinon (Negros Oriental); commercial production of steam from these fields
began in 1984.
3.24     PNOC-EDC enters into a service contract with OEA to develop each
geothermal steam prospect that it seeks to operate. Under these contracts,
which have a term of five years and are renewable for another two, PNOC-EDC
provides all the necessary services, technology and finance needed to develop
the geothermal resource. Where resources are proven to be commercially
exploitable, the contract remains in force for the balance of the exploration
period and for another 25 years; thereafter, the contract may be extended for
another 15 years at PNOC-EDC's option. Under these contracts, PNOC-EDC is due
to pay OEA a 'fee" equal to 60X of the net value of the steam produced in any
year, beginning after a tax holiday (para. 4.29).
3.25     Orpanization, Management and Staff.  PNOC's Chairman and President
serve PNOC-EDC in those same capacities. PNOC-EDC's day-to-day operations are
managed by a full-time Vice President and General Manager, who sits on PNOC-
EDC's seven-member Board.
3.26     PNOC-EDC has four operational divisionss  (a) Geothermal, (b) Energy
Drilling, (c) Environmental Management, and (d) Operation Services. Separate
management services and computer services groups provide support to manage-
ment. The Geothermal Division, which would implement the proposed project's
geothermal component, is adequately staffed. Its complement of 1,200 staff
members include 69 geoscientists, 136 drilling engineers and 51 engineers,
several of whom have been trained abroad (Annex 3.04). The other three
operating divisions are also adequately staffed.
3.27     Training and Technical Assistance.  PNOC-EDC currently has a highly
competent technical staff. Until 1983, a joint venture of the Geothermal
Technical Resource Corporation (a PNOC subsidiarv) and KRTA provided PNOC-EDC
with technical expertise in geothermal exploration and development. Under
this arrangement, KRTA provided PNOC-EDC with technical staff of its own and
offered training in New Zealand to designated PNOC-EDC technical staff. Part
of the cost of these services was financed by bilateral aid from the
Government of New Zealand. Similarly, training was also financed by the
Governments of Italy and Japan. PNOC-EDC is now technically self-reliant, but
still employs two KRTA experts to advise on highly specialized technical



- 29 -
matters. In addition, PNOC-EDC has ample in-house training programs. These
arrangements are appropriate.
3.28     Collections.  PNOC-EDC sells all the steam it produces to NPC.  The
normal contractual terms provide for a payment term of 45 days from the
billing date; thereafter, interest is payable, currently at 12X. PNOC-EDC has
not had difficulties in collecting its receivables. On occasion, NPC was
excused from the "take-or-pay' provision in its contract when compliance was
not feasible for reasons beyond NPC's control.
3.29     Accounting and Audit.  PNOC-EDC follows the same accounting
principles and practices and audit arrangements as PNOC. At negotiations,
PNOC-EDC agreed to keep separate accounts for each area being dev .oped under
the proposed project and to furnish regularly to the Bank financial reports
summarizing these accounts.
IV. FINANCE
4.1      While NPC and PNOC-EDC have businesses that inter-relate, they have
substantially different financial characters. This chapter will present
financial analyses separately for each of the two institutions.
A. NPC
4.2      Although wholly-owned by the Government, NPC enjoys substantial
financial autonomy. NPC manages its financial affairs and maintains its
accounts. Subject to Government approvals, NPC is authorized to formulate its
investment program, establish its tariff, enter into contract with suppliers
of goods and services, and borrow for its own account from foreign, as well as
domestic, lenders.
4.3      Past and Present Financial Performance.  NPC's financial performance
for 1984-86 is presented in Annex 4.01 and summarized in Table 4.1.

4.4      These results reflect, though hardly adequately, the financial strin-
gency faced by NPC during this period. NPC is permitted, under its charter,
to realize annually a 10! rate of return on revalued net fixed assets after
covering all operating expenses; the high rates of return during the period
reflect its policy of setting rates at the maximum allowable level. During
the period, NPC's investment program focused on completing projects begun
years earlier; PNPP, which was then in advanced stages of construction, was
expected to meet the full growth in demand in the Luzon grid until the early-
to mid-199Os. As a result, NPC was incurring only modest capital expenditures
and realizing substantial self-financing ratios. However, these two favorable
indicators belied 'he cash constraints that NPC was facing.
4.5      NPC's low current ratio and debt service coverage ratio, combined
with its high operating ratio, debt/total capital ratio and accounts receiv-
able and accounts payable turnover rates are all indicators of those cash
constraints. As its own financial position worsened, NPC found itself barely
able to raise cash through new external borrowings and unable to secure new
equity capital. Moreover, as its customers encountered cash flow difficulties
of their own, NPC experienced collection problems; unable to realize its
operating revenues or raise cash from other sources, NPC itself became delin-
quent in paying its bills, especially fuel bills incurred with subsidiaries of
PNOC. As importantly, NPC was having to use most of its available cash to
service debt, much of which was incurred to finance the highly over-budget
PNPP, that was increasingly becoming due for repayment. During the period,
NPC tried to reduce costs; however, reductions were possible mainly for desir-
able expenditures on the maintenance of physical plant and human resources.



- 31 -
4.6      During 1986-87, following its decision to mothball PNPP, the
Government deciled to relieve NPC of the financial constraints posed by that
investment. C-rrently, the Government is paying all expenses for maintaining
the plant and all debt service associated with loans raised to finance its
construction. Subject to the approval of NPC's lenders, the Government
expects to assume formal responsibility for PNPP by arranging to transfer the
plant's assets and the corresponding liabilities from NPC's 1987 year-end
books of accounts. The Government will also compensate NPC for the amount of
investment value met with internally generated cash by assuming responsibility
for an equal amount of NPC's arrears to PNOC.  Concurrently, NPC has concluded
an arrangement for MERALCO to settle its outstanding arrears of P 1.7 billion
with front end payments aggregating R 0.9 billion and a six-year first
mortgage note for the remainder; and the Government is pressing the coopera-
tives through NEA to restructure their arrears to NPC. These measures are
expected to make NPC current financially and to provide a fund of cash or cash
equivalent credit to enable NPC to meet its local currency requirements into
Vf89, assuming its customers pay for current consumption on time. At
negotiations, NPC agreed to implement an action program, acceptable to the
Government and the Bank, to maintain its accounts receivable and accounts
payable at levels consistent with proper commercial practices. A draft of
this program, which was discussed and confirmed at negotiations, is presented
in Annex 4.02.
4.7      Foreign Exchange Exposure.  As of December 31, 1986, NPC had on its
books, net of borrowings raised to finance PNPP, nearly P 46 billion in loans
denominated in fore'gn currency. Many of these loans were raised in
connection with capital investments undertaken in periods of more favorable
exchange rates. NPC passes the burden of debt service on these loans to the
consumer by way of a foreign exchange adjustment included in its tariff.
Under these circumstances, NPC could be chary about increasing its foreign
exchange exposure in the future; however, as NPC cannot obtain suitable long
term financing for its investments in local capital markets, and as most of
its investments have significant foreign cost components, it will need to
continue borrowing substantially from foreign lenders (para. 4.13). There-
fore, NPC's current practices of (a) making maximum use of concessionary
finance, and (b) including in its tariff a foreign exchange adjustment, are
appropriate.
4.8      Valuation of Assets.  NPC revalues its assets and takes the results
into its books of accounts yearly. Each year, NPC applies a trending factor,
developed from an aggregation of price indices, to the foreign and local value
of its assets. Then, the value of those assets is further adjusted to reflect
changes in the outstanding principal of loans used to finance those assets.
Every four years, an independent consultant is retained to validate the
adjustments to the fixed asset accounts. This validation consists of a desk
study that considers, inter alia, the cost of replacing those assets. As
presented, this methodology could result in some overvaluation of NPC's fixed
assets. During supervision of the proposed project, the Bank plans to review
with NPC the methodology for asset revaluation and seek the implementation of
adjustments, considered appropriate by both parties, to that methodology.



- 32 -
4.9      Tariff.  NPC's tariff is presented in Annex 4.03.  It includes:
(a) a basic charge, consisting of demand and energy components; (b) a fuel
adjustment; (c) an exchange rate adjustment; (d) a coal price adjustment; and
(e) a steam price adjustment. NPC's current average revenue of about USh 4.7
per kWh is slightly less than the US4 5 per kWh being realized by the
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, the region's most comparable
utility. As a wholesaler, NPC sells power mainly to other utilities; its
level of rates is, therefore, appropriate if poorer retail consumers can
satisfy their minimum need for electricity at an affordable rate while the
distribution utilities have the potential to be financially viable. NPC's
customers supply generous blocks of electricity to residential and small
commercial consumers at lifeline rates. The financial difficulties being
experienced by many distribution utilities are more reflective of operating
and cost factors than of affordability constraints. Therefore, NPC's average
revenues per kWh are appropriate.
4.10     A tariff study, financed by ADB and conducted by Electricitb de
France (EdF) in 1986, established that NPC's tariff produces revenues that are
consistent with marginal cost pricing; however, the tariff structure deviates
substantially from marginal cost principles. A Presidential Decree, issued in
January 1987, ordered all power utilities to adjust their charges in line with
long run marginal cost. The distribution utilities are waiting for NPC to
make its adjustments before formulating their own; in turn, the Government
asked NPC to adjust appropriately the structure of its tariff by late 1987.
NPC is concerned that it may not be ready to introduce full marginal cost
pricing so soon and may instead introduce an interim tariff shortly.
4.11     NPC has enjoyed considerable autonomy in setting prices.  NPC
normally resets the adjustments every month automatically in accordance with
parameters published in its tariff; in the past, it has not been required to
clear monthly changes in the adjustments with any regulatory body. Periodi-
cally, NPC's management formulates, and its Board promulgates, changes in the
basic charge and the formulas used in computing the adjustments. In the past,
such changes were cleared informally with the Office of the President prior to
introduction. Recently, the Government decided to require NPC to submit rate
changes to ERB for approval; the manner of implempnting this decision is still
under discussion. At negotiations, the Government gave an undertaking that,
in futr.re regulatory reviews of tariff proposals, NPC's financial requirements
as well as other factors will be taken into consideration.
4.12     FinancinA Plan.  NPC's financing plan for 1988-92, the period of
expenditure on the proposed project, is presented in Table 4.2:

NPC's component of the proposed project represents 4X of its investment
program for the period. The NPC Loan and the Italian protocol soft loan each
account for about 1X of its financing requirement.
4.13     During this period, NPC expects to finance about 33X of its invest-
ment program from internal cash generation. NPC has experienced little diffi-
culty in obtaining foreign borrowings; during the period, NPC expects to meet
more than 902 of its foreign exchange requirements with foreign borrowings,
the bulk of which it expects to raise from official sources, on terms that are
comparable to or more favorable than commercial loans. NPC is expecting to
meet much of the remainder of its financing requirement from locally issued
five-year debt. This finance will be needed to meet the portion of its peso
denominated investment program not covered by internal cash generation (142 of
its aggregate investment program). Currently, no such instrument of debt
enjoys extensive use in the Philippines and the Government nas been reluctant
to authorize NPC to issue bonds with such a seemingly long maturity; moreover,
given the capital intensiveness and term of construction of NPC's investments,
the usefulness of a five-year instrument is limited (para. 4.15).
4.14     Future Financial Performance.  Detailed financial projections for the
period 1987-95 are presented in Annex 4.01. A summary of key financial
indicators is given in Table 4.3.

4.15      The projections indicate that NPC can expect relative financial ease
during 1987-89; thereafter, it should face increasingly severe constraints.
This pattern highlights the impact of (a) the quasi-restructuring of NPC in
conjunction with both the transfer of PNPP to the Government and the refinanc-
ing of receivables and (b) the absence of a suitable instrument for financing
the local currency gap (para. 4.13). Much of liquidity tightness forecast for
the 1992-95 period results from the need to refinance principal repayments on
the five-year debt floated from 1989 and thereafter. The Government will need
to consider whether (i) the high cost of bridging the local currency gap
should be borne by the consumer; (ii) it should provide relief by infusing
some equity; and (iii) it should assist NPC with the development and use of a
new long term financing instrument. This matter will be pursued further with
the Government during the forthcoming energy sector study; thereafter, the
Government will need to consider the policy implications of the various
alternatives. At negotiations, NPC agreed that, by December of each year, it
will review with the Bank (i) its bud&et for the next sear, and (ii) its
financial plan for the next five years, paying close attention to the specific
instruments it plans to use to meet its local currency financing requirements.
4.16      This projected financial performance is based on NPC's continuing its
policy of setting rates at levels aimed at meeting the 10? rate of return
target allowed under its charter. This implies that average revenues per kWh



- 35 -
would increase at a compound annual rate of 5.7X, representing about 20t less
than inflation projected for the period, to levels about 552 above current
charges. To encourage this policy while acknowledging the inevitability of
delays in matching cost increases with tariff increases, at negotiations, NPC
agreed that it will maintain its annual operating revenues at levels
sufficient to realize, after meeting operating costs (including depreciatior)
and taxes (if any), an 82 rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in
operation. The projections also assume that NPC will collect its receivables
effectively and pay its bills on time. On this basis, NPC is expected to
generate cash sufficient to meet an average self-financing ratio of 352 during
1988-92, dropping to about 202 in 1993-94 (largely because of a need to
service the five-year debt); at the same time, debt service coverage is
expected to average 1.6 in 1988-93, and drop to about 1.4 in 1994-95. To
encourage efficient cash and debt management, at negotiations, NPC agreed that
it may incur additional debt only if a reasonable forecast of its net revenues
after expenditures for each year during the term of the debt to be incurred
shall be at least 1.3 times its projected debt service requirement.
B. PNOC AND PNOC-EDC
4.17     PNOC-EDC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PNOC.  Although erjoying
considerable operating autonomy, PNOC-EDC is still highly dependent on PNOC's
financial support. In view of this dependence, the financial conditions of
both the parent company and the subsidiary are discussed below.
PNOC
4.18     CaDital Structure.  Although PNOC is a Government corporation with a
mandate to ensure the adequacy of the country's energy supply, it receives no
special privileges, and, in all of its activities, it competes directly with
the private sector. As of December 31, 1986, PNOC had total assets of
P 20,831 million that were supported by a satisfactory capital structure
(Table 4.4). Most of PNOC's current profitability is derived from its oil
activities. Coal operations yielded marg1nal losses in 1986, mainly as a
result of price deregulation and a liberalized coal import policy. Geothermal
steam production, which began only in 1984, yielded a small profit in 1986;
this activity is expected to contribute significantly to PNOC's future
earnings.

4.19     All of PNOC's capital stock is owned by the Government, which
financed its stock subscriptions from an Oil Industries Special Fund. This
Special Fund, which itself was financed from petroleum taxes, was dissolved in
late-1984. PNOC was still due to receive an allocation from that Fund of
1 1.2 billion; in late-1986, the Government decided to meet this commitment
and has already remitted one installment of 1 250 million. PNOC's retained
earnings largely represent income from petroleum operations, which accrue from
revenues for the sale of refined petroleum products net of (a) operating
expenses, (b) the duty paid on the delivered cost of crude oil, and (c) the
cost of the imported petroleum. PNOC's existing long term debt consists
entirely of loans from foreign commercial and official sources. Some of these
loans are covered by the restructuring arrangements concluded for the public
corporate sector by the Government and a consortium of foreign financial
institutions. Some 1 505 million of undisbursed funds remain available to
PNOC from the Bank's Loan 2203-PH, which financed geothermal development, and
from an ADB loan, which financed refinery modification and miscellaneous
items. As of December 31, 1986, PNOC recorded about 1 7,998 million in
current liabilities, accruing primarily from the company's trading activities.
The company has supported these current liabilities with substantial
liquidity. PNOC has provided its subsidiaries with easy access to inter-
company advances and expects to continue doing so. Considering the nature of
PNOC's business, its financial structure is appropriate.
4.20     Financial Performance.  As summarized in Table 4.5 and detailed in
Annex 4.05, PNOC's financial position as of December 31, 1986 was satisfac-
tory. This soundness resulted primarily because a number of previously
unsolvable issues were resolved, including (a) assumption by the Government of
responsibility for NPC's accounts receivable; (b) remittance of the first
installment of the previously suspended equity financing from the Oil
industries Special Fund, together with assurances that future installments
would be forthcoming; and (c) reinstatement by the Government of foreign
currency lines of credit for petroleum imports. PNOC's financial ratios
during 1984-86 were satisfactory, and its internal cash generation was
sufficient to cover capital investments and debt service. PNOC used its
internally generated cash to finance its working capital requirements and
borrowed from abroad to finance its foreign exchange needs.

4.21     Asset Valuation.  PNOC is predominantly a trading company, with
current assets exceeding 502 of total assets. Much of its property and equip-
ment has been financed from foreign loans. Foreign exchange gains or losses
arising from trading transactions are reflected in income; however, exchange
adjustments on foreign currency liabilities that were incurred in acquiring
property and equipment are capitalized to the corresponding asset. As a
result, the peso value of PNOC's fixed assets tends to appreciate. Otherwise,
PNOC does not have a systematic procedure for periodically revaluing its
assets. During supervision of the proposed project, the Bank will review with
PNOC various approaches to regular asset revaluation and will seek the imple-
mentation of a methodology considered appropriate by all parties.
4.22     Tariffs.  PNOC is primarily concerned with the adequacy of sale
prices for petroleum products. ERB fixes and regulates these prices with the
aim of balancing the interests of the consumer, the oil companies, and the
Government. The consumer pays prices correlated as closely as possible to the
posted price in the Singapore market; the oil companies retain net revenues
sufficient to enable reasonable profitability; and the Government realizes
revenues through taxes and duties on petroleum. Some oil-related revenues
were used to establish an Oil Price Stabilization Fund aimed at protecting the
consumer from overly volatile retail price changes and insulating the oil
companies froa sudden changes in crude oil prices.
4.23     Future Financial Performance.  Financial projections for PNOC during
1987-92 are presented in Annexes 4.04 and 4.05, and summarized in Table 4.6.
These projections indicate that PNOC is likely to (a) maintain satisfactory
liquidity; (b) remain conservatively capitalized; (c) operate profitably; and



- 38 -
(d) generate internal cash, net of debt service, sufficient to meet about 601
of its affiliates' capital expenditure during the period. This performance
suggests that PNOC should be able to provide PNOC-EDC with the support that
will be needed during the project implementation period.

PNOC-EDC
4.24     PNOC-EDC functions as an autonomous company with responsibility for
controlling costs and realizing profits. It maintains its own financial
accounts and compiles annual financial statements that are subject to audit.
Among its accounting activities, PNOC-EDC maintains separate accounts for each
geothermal area. PNOC-EDC began commercial operations in 1984. From a steam
production capacity (at both the Tongonan and Palinpinon fields) that was
sufficient to power 225 KW of generation and yield a maximum of 1,478 GWh of



- 39 -
energy, the steam volume actually sold yielded only 330 -"h of electric energy
in 1984, 578 GWh in 1985, and 605 GWh in 1986. These lo levels of sales
resulted from the slow growth in demand for electricity in Leyte and Negros,
the islands where these steam fields are located. PNOC-EDC reduced its explo-
ration and field development: activities during 1984-86, as a result of the
Government's decision to curtail investments in response to the country's
economic difficulties. Table 4.7, which presents PNOC-EDC's capital expendi-
tures for 1976-86, shows the regular increase in investment levels until 1983
and the sharp curtailment of investment thereafter.

4.25     Capital Structure.  PNOC-EDC has depended on its parent company for
financial support. This support has been extended through (a) equity invest-
ments, and (b) inter-company advances (usually indefinitely renewable three-
month promissory notes, currently bearing an interest rate of 8X). This
dependence is expected to continue until about 1994, when PNOC-EDC's sales of
geothermal steam are expected to produce internal cash generation sufficient
to enable substantial self-financing. PNOC-EDC's capital structure is
presented in Table 4.8.

4.27     Taxes.  PNOC-EDC may seek for the commercial operations of each area
under development an exemption from income taxes for up to six years. The
Government has decided to make available, based on the merits of an applica-
tion, such a tax holiday to any developer of a new industry. After the tax
holiday, PNOC-EDC will be required to pay OEA a 'fee' (including income tax)
equal to 602 of its net revenues. Since this fee is higher than the 35?
income tax rate applicable to most companies in the Philippines, PNOC-EDC has
asked the Government to rationalize this requirement. In conjunction with the
forthcoming sector study, the Bank will review with OEA, PNOC and PNOC-EDC the
basis for this fee, and will seek implementation of adjustments considered
appropriate by all parties.
4.28     Tariffs.  An ADB-financed study on the pricing of geothermal
resources recommended that the principle of 'avoided costs' be followed in
developing the price NPC would pay for geothermal steam; the price itself
should be competitive with the cost to NPC for alternative fuels while also
enabling revenues sufficient for PNOC-EDC to recover its full cost of produc-
tion (including the cost of the investment). This principle is expected to
form the basis of a future steam pricing policy. In connection with the
proposed project, NPC and PNOC-EDC will need to agree on a price, acceptable
to OEA, for the steam needed to drive the Bacon Manito geothermal power
station. The Bank has received a memorandum of understanding specifying the
terms on which NPC will purchase the steam needed for the Bacon Manito power
station, inter alia including a steam price (USI 2.7 per kWh) that falls



- 41 -
within the range defined by PNOC-EDC's cost of production and NPC's avoided
cost. Execution by NPC and PNOC-EDC of a purchase contract, based on the
memorandum of understanding, will be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan.
4.29     Future Filancial lPeformanne.  PNOC-EDC's expected financial perfi.r-
mance during 1987-95 is presented in Annex 4.06, with the underlying assump-
tions in Annex 4.07; the projection through 1992 is summarized in Table 4.10.
This projection reflects PNOC's decision to finance PNOC-EDC's exploration
expenditures using equity infusions and, correspondingly, to decrease the use
of inter-company advances. Moreover, the projection reflects PNOC's decision
to treat these advances as long term debt in the future. By 1994, with the
completion of currently planned development programs and the corresponding
increases in steam production, PNOC-EDC is expected to make regular repayments
of its borrowings from PNOC and also declare substantial dividends.

To encourage the satisfactory performance shown in the projections, at
negotiations, PNOC-EDC agreed (a) to maintain a debt/equity ratio, net of any
reserve for revaluation of assets, of not more than 70s30 (with inter-company
advances classified as long term debt); (b) to maintain a current ratio of not
less than 1.0; and (c) to incur additional debt only if a reasonable forecast
of its net revenues after expenditures (excluding depreciation), taxes, and
dividends for each year during the term of the debt to be incurred shall be at
least 1.25 times PNOC-EDC's projected debt service requirements. In
determining the debt service coverage ratio, debt will mean all indebtedness
of PNOC-EDC, excludir.3 inter-company advances from PNOC. Also at
negotiations, PNOC agreed to take all actions required to enable PNOC-EDC to
meet these and other obligations under its Project Agreement with the Bank,
including (a) providing PNOC-EDC with share capital and inter-company loans as
necessary and (b) enabling PNOC-EDC to use such other means as it has
available to raise counterpart funds.
4.30     Financial Analysis of the Geothermal Steam Component.  The geothermal
steam development component of the proposed project has two partss (a) the
development and subsequent commissioning of the Bacon Manito I geothermal
steam field, and (b) the delineation and appraisal of geothermal sites in
Luzon. The former part represents a time-slice in the exploration and
development of the Bacon Manito I geothermal steam field. Work on that field
began in 1979. The Bank first supported that investment with Loan 2203-PH,
which provided, inter alia, for the drilling of about 11 exploratory wells at
Bacon Manito I. These wells have been drilled and the steam reserves are
proven. The proposed loan will help (a) complete the drilling of Bacon
Manito I; (b) develop the steam-gathering system; and (c) bring the field into
commercial production. The financial analysis for Bacon Manito I takes into
account all the Investments since 1979 and projects revenues from operations
for 25 years, beginning in 1991. A financial analysis cannot be performed on
the second part until the drilling has been completed and the extent of steam
reserves can be established. At that time, future investment can be
predicated on the likelihood of satisfactory financial returns.
4.31     A financial analysis of the entire Bacon Manito I development is
presented in Annex 4.08. Total investment (in 1987 prices) is US$73.3 mil-
lion. Of this amount, US$51.5 million had been expended through the end of
1986. During 1987 and part of 1988, little progress is expected on this
development; thereafter, works will resume according to a schedule that would
enable steam production to be synchronized with NPC's target for commissioning
the power plant in early 1991.
4.32     Based on the principles enunciated in the ADB-financed geothermal
steam pricing study taken in combination with the tax holiday and fee remis-
sions that are likely to be available for this specific development of geo-
thermal resources, the price applicable for steam to power the Bacon Manito
generating station was estimated at the equivalent of US mils 30 per kWh in
1986 prices. An equivalent price of P 0.65 per kWh (in 1987 prices) was,
therefore, used in computing the financial rate of return. This price was
escalated by the local price escalation rate for the Philippines. Assuming
the tax holiday and fee remissions during the first six years of commercial
sales and a reduction in the Government fee to 40X from the current level of
602, the financial rate of return would be 14.1?. Based on the aforementioned



- 43 -
parameters, Table 4.11 summarizes the likely benefits to PNOC-EDC and the
Government from the Bacon Manito I development.

4.33     Sensitivity and Risk Analysis.  During the current pricing negotia-
tions between NPC and PNOC-EDC, the parties have discussed a range of prices
between US mils 26 per kWh and US mils 30 per kWh (1986 prices). Table 4.12
summarizes the likely benefits to PNOC-EDC and the Government from the Bacon
Manito I development based on a steam price of US mils 26 per kWh (1986
prices).

i  An agreement has since been reached between NPC and PNOC-EDC on the steam-
price in terms of which it will be the equivalent of US 2.76 per kWh
4.34     A sensitivity was run based on the assumption that completion of
construction of the power station might be delayed by up to one year.  In this
case, assuming a steam price at US mils 30 per kWh (1986 prices), PNOC-EDC's
rate of return would decrease to 12.7X, with the tax incentives; with tax
incentives, the rate of return drops to 10.9? if the steam price is US mils 26
per kWh (1986 prices).  Because much of the required investment has already
been expended, the risk of significant cost overruns for the remainder is
considered minor. Even so, a 10? increase in the remaining investment would
reduce the rate of return by about 0.3S. The market risk is considered
negligible; moreover, because the 16 wells already drilled have shown reserves
sufficient to fuel about 102.5 MW of power generation, the risk of a shortfall
of steam has been discounted.
V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A. Justification
5.1      The project encompasses complementary components from geothermal
development and delineation to power generation and transmission. The total
available capacity of the Luzon system is estimated at about 3,000 MW
(para. 1.11). In comparison with this capacity, the system is currently
experiencing a peak demand of 2,500 MW which is projected to grow to 3,250 MW
by 1992. If there were no addition to the generating capacity, the system's
loss of load probability would increase from its present level of 2 days/year
to 7 days/year in 1989 and more than 30 days/year in 1991. Transmission/dis-
tribution losses within Luzon have increased from 14? in 1978 to 24? in 1986.
Currently, no new generation plant is under construction in Luzon, while the
grid is in urgent need of peaking, as well as base-load generating capacity
(para. 1.11). NPC is planning to meet the shortage of peaking capacity by



- 45 -
installing two gas turbines with a total capacity of 350 MW. The base-load
generating capacity can be met by either geothermal power plant or a coal-
fired power station. Although NPC's long term generation expansion program
has not yet been finalized, the medium term options, as well as their relative
economic advantages, are relatively clear.  The lacon Manito Geothermal Power
Project, utilizing geothermal steam for the 110 MW power plant, presents the
least-cost option to supply the next increment in base-load generating
capacity in Luzon. The discounted incremental cost to construct and operate
this power plant is US$121 million compared *'o a discounted cost of US$161
million for an equivalent coal-fired power station, which would constitute the
next best alternative. The equalizing discount rate between the Bacon Manito
geothermal power plant and an equivalent coal plant is 392 (Annex 5.01). This
high rate is due largely to the treatment of the previously incurred
investments on geothermal exploration as sunk costs. Should one take account
of all previous costs, the rate w3uld decline to about 12?.
5.2      The transmission component of the project is necessary to meet the
forecast increase in power demands with acceptable levels of seer:ice quality
and reliability and to restore some of the old system components to efficient
operational state. The distribution component of the project ensures the
efficiency of upstream investments, a large portion of which would otherwise
be dissipated as losses. The project has several other components which are
needed for improving the operational and institutional efficiencies of the
concerned entities. Thus, the proposed project constitutes an integrated
approach to developing new generation and transmission; rehabilitating some of
the old facilities; and assisting the technical, commercial and financial
performances of NPC.
B. Economic Rate of Return
5.3      The internal economic rate of return (IERR) for the main Bacon Manito
Geothermal Power Project is computed based on: (a) the incremental sales
revenue and consumer surplus; and (b) the incremental economic benefit of the
project including sales revenue from the plant. The capital and operating
cost includes those oft (a) development of additional wells and steam-
gathering system needed to supply the required steam for the plant; and
(b) the power plant and its associated transmission line.
5.4      The IERR of the project, based on direct benefits measured in terms
of sales revenues is about 19? (Annex 5.02), which is substantially higher
than the opportunity cost of capital (12Z). With the incorporation of
consumer surplus, based on demand functions for various consumer groups, the
IERR increases to 31Z.
5.5      Since the transmission/distribution and rehabilitation components
consist of numerous dispersed items, its benefits are not attributable to a
specific region or a specific group of consumers. Therefore, the economic
rate of return for the components cannot be assessed meaningfully. However,
the benefits are expected to be substantial and to justify the costs fully.

C. Risks
5.6      The pi^oject faces no substantial physical risk in implementation.
Extensive scientific investigations and independent resource assessment have
concluded that reserves are sufficient to drive the power plant during its
lifetim3, and NPC's familiarity with geothermal power plants makes the risk
associated with implementation minimal. Also, acquisition of land and rights-
of-way for substations and transmission lines is not expected to cause any
serious problems. However, as a result of its financial weakness, NPC could
have difficulty realizing counterpart funds and, thereby, keeping to the
project implementation schedule. The recently completed restructuring of NPC
is a major step to minimize these risks. Because the Project Implementation
Committee is being formed by agreement of the beneficiaries and would not
function under the authority of a preponderant institution, the project
includes a risk that the Committee cannot enforce the coordination needed in
implementing the proposed project. However, the need for such coordination is
minimal since the institutions have agreed to steam price and to design
parameters.
VI. AGREEMENTS
6.1      Agreements regarding the following items were reached during
negotiationss
(a) For the development of the Bacon Manito I steam-gathering system,
PNOC-EDC will appoint a consultant for project execution services.
On completion of appraisal and delineation drilling at prospective
geothermal sites, PNOC-EDC will retain an independent consultant for
study of resource assessment and techno-economics of field
development (para. 2.20).
(b) PNOC-EDC would furnish annually to the Bank its exploration program
for the next year for areas covered by the project (para. 2.35).
(c) NPC will furnish to the Bank, by June 30 of each year, audited finan-
cial statements for the previous year, together with the certifica-
tion and long form report prepared by an acceptable auditor
(para. 3.13).
(d) PNOC will provide the Bank with audited financial statements,
together with the certification and long form report of an acceptable
auditor to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal year.
This report should include statements concerning (i) the holding
company by itself, (ii) the holding company consolidated with all
subsidiaries, and (iii) all subsidiaries (para. 3.21).
(e) PNOC-EDC will maintain separate accounts for each area to be
developed under the proposed project, and will furnish the Bank with
financial reports summarizing these accounts regularly (para. 3.29).



- 47 -
(f) NPC will implement an action program, acceptable to the Government
and the Bank, to maintain its accounts receivable and accounts
payable at levels consistent with proper commercial practices
(para. 4.6).
(g) NPC will, by December 1 of each year, review with the Bank (i) its
budget for the next year, and (ii) its financial plan for the next
five years, paying close attention to the specific instruments it
plans to use to meet its local currency financing requirements
(para. 4.15).
(h) NPC will maintain its annual operating revenues at levels sufficient
to realize, after meeting operating costs (including depreciation)
and taxes (if any), an 81 rate of return on revalued net fixed assets
in operation (para. 4.16).
(i) NPC would incur additional debt only if a reasonable forecast of its
net revenues after expenditures for each year during the term of the
debt to be incurred shall be at least 1.3 times its projected debt
service requirement (para. 4.16).
(j)  PNOC-EDC will (a) maintain a debt/equity ratio, net of any reserve
for revaluation of assets (with inter-company loans classified as
long term debt), of not more than 70:30; (b) maintain a current ratio
of not less than 1.0; and (c) incur additional debt only if a
reasonable forecast of its net revenues after expenditures (excluding
depreciation), taxes, and dividends for each year during the term of
the debt to be incurred shall be at least 1.25 times PNOC-EDC's
projected debt service requirements (para. 4.29).
(k) PNOC will take all actions required to enable PNOC-EDC to meet these
and other obligations under its Project Agreement with the Bank,
including (a) providing PNOC-EDC with share capital and inter-company
loans as necessary and (b) enabling PNOC-EDC to use other means as it
has available to raise counterpart funds (para. 4.29).
6.2      During negotiations, clarifications regarding the following were
obtained and are reflected in the minutes:
(a) In the course of the Energy Sector Study, the Bank ascertained that
NPC was developing methodologies for investment program formulation
that were satisfactory; therefore, the annual reviews of NPC's
investment program could focus as much on the methods used for
investment optimization as on the constituents of the program
(para. 1.12).
(b) Government will undertake that, in future regulatory reviews of
tariff proposals, NPC's financial requirements as well as other
factors will be taken into consideration (para. 4.11).
6.3      Conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan would be:
(i) Execution by NPC and PNOC of a sales contract for the sale of
steam to drive the proposed Bacon Manito Geothermal Power
Project (para. 4.28).



- 48 -
(ii) Execution of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement, satisfactory to the
Bank, between PNOC and PNOC-EDC (para. 2.16).
6.4      With the above agreements and clarifications, the project constitutes
a suitable basis for two Bank loans aggregating US$100 million equivalent
(consisting of one loan for US$59 million to be lent to NPC and a second loan
for US$41 million to be lent to PNOC. These loans would each have a term of
20 years, including five years of grace on repayment of principal, and carry
the standard variable interest rate.

BACON MANITO IGEOTHERMAL POWER PROJECT
National Power Corporation
Action Program to Reduce Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable
I. Accounts Receivable
A. Measures Already Undertaken by NPC
1. Offer Incentive Program to Customers
Early in 1987, incentives in the form of discounts were extended to
delinquent customers in order to encourage the early settlement of overdue
power accounts. Fifteen (15) out of one hundred thirty-two (132) delinquent
customers were able to avail of this program settling a total of # 43.2
million in overdue accounta. Mostly, industrial customers (10 out of 15) w"re
able to settle their accounts through the incentive program. Attachment 1
shows the complete list of customers that availed of the said program.
2. Filins of Collection Cases
Collection cases have been filed against twenty-one (21) delinquent
customers with aggregate outstanding accounts amounting to P 265 million.
These collection cases have actually forced some of the delinquent customers
to reach an amicable settlement through the execution of restructuring agree-
ments.
3. Restructuring of Overdue Accounts
Accounts restructured in 1987 totalled 1 1,855 million with 1 935
million already liquidated as of October 31, 1987. The bulk of these restruc-
tured accounts is MERALCO's account, which amounted to P 1,176 million as of
June 30, 1987. As part of the restructuring agreement which took effect last-
August, front-end cash payments in an aggregate amount of 1 916 million were
required from MERALCO; these payments were received in full by October 1987.11
Repayment of the balance, amounting to 1 800 million, shall commence in 1991.
Attachment 2 shows the list of customers with restructured account and the
corresponding number of months over which each account has been restructured.
1/ MERALCO's staggered front-end cash payments:
July          1 400 million
September     1 100 millin
October       1 416 million
Total     1 916 million



- 99 -
ANNEX 4.02
Page 2 of 7
Accounts restructured prior to 1987 totalled 1 432 million, with
1 131 million already liquidated as of September 30, 1987.
With the customers' compliance with the amortization of restructured
accounts over and above their current bills, a further reduction in NPC's
power receivables is expected. As leverage to ensure these customers' timely
payments, automatic disconnection is effected for failure to pay on due dates.
However, disconnection of power service may not easily be implemented,
especially when the peace and order situation in the area concerned is being
threatened.
4. Offsetting of Accounts of Governfment Customers with the Bureau of
Treasury
NPC has an ongoing arrangement with the Bureau of Treasury, wherein
allotments to some Government agencies are directly remitted to NPC (subject
to clearance from the respective Government agencies). As of October 31,
1987, the total Government accounts credited to NPC amounts to # 450 million.
Xost of these Government agencies are MERALCO customers, who pay to NPC for
the account of MERALCO; in addition, some direct Government customers have
offsetting arrangements with NPC, namely the City of Bantagas, City of
Olongapo and others.
Also, just recently, the relending to electric cooperatives of an
equity investment of 1 500 million in NEAI has been approved. -This amount
shall be used to liquidate the arrearages of electric cooperatives with NPC.
NPC shall, in turn, remit this amount to the National Government in payment of
outstanding indebtedness.
5. Seek Support from the Office of the President
Government accolmits &re, more often than not, considered as
problematic accounts not only by NPC but also by most of NPC's utility
customers. For this reason, NPC has sought the support of the President in
order to ensure the timely payment of power bills by Government customers.
A complete list of NPC's Government customers and a partial list of
delinquent Government customers of the electric cooperatives and private
utilities have been recently submitted to the Bureau of Local Government
Supervision, which, in turn, instructed these Government agencies to take
steps towards the early settlement of their overdue power accounts.
NPC will gather the list of delinquent Government customers from
electric cooperatives and utilities for submission to the Bureau of LocAl
Government Supervision regularly.
6. Manasement Takeover of the Distribution System of Problematic_
Customers
-        An interim takeover of the power distribution system of'thb 'City
Government of Batangas was effected November 1, 1987 to arrest the progressive
increase of this customer's indebtedness, which already amounts to 1 134
million and increases at an average rate of 1 4.75 million per month. The
complete takeover of this Government utility is still being worked out,



- 100 -
ANNEX 4.02
Page 3 of 7
The takeover of the distribution system of another Government utility
customer, Bataan EPZA, is now under study. Bataan EPZA's overdue account has
soared to P 85 million.
B.  R.ecommended Actions/Heasures to Improve NPC's Power Accounts Receivable
Level
In order to minimize the build-up and, where possible, to reduce its
power accounts receivables, NPC shall continue to undertake the rigid
implementation of its collection policies.
NPC shall continue with its public information drive to assist
customers' awareness in improving collections and reducing systems losses,
which are actually major factors affecting the payment performance of these
customers. Campaigns against electricity theft shall likewise be launched.
Also, the following support shall be further requested from the
President of the Philippines:
(a)  To instruct the Department of Budget and Managementi and the Depart-
ment of Finance to immediately credit to NPC's account the payment of
the overdue and current power bills of delinquent Government units,
instead of releasing the same amount directly to these units (i.e.,
in addition to those with existing offsetting arrangements).
(b) To reaffirm NPC's right to cause power disconnection to delinquent
customers, customers, the exercise of which shall be free from
political intervention.
C. Status of NPC Power Receivables as of September 30. 1987
NPC's total power accounts receivable amounts to P 4,088 million as
of September 30, 1987, which is a net decrease of P 855 million (or 17X) from
the year-end 1986 level. Further breaking down this change in receivables
level, P 115 million (or 82), is due to an increase in the power consumption
of customers while P 970 million (or 282) is due to the reduction in
customers' total overdue account.
A further reduction .bl NPC's receivables level is expected by year-
end due to the following factors:
(a)  Inclusion of MERALCO's second layer of front-end cash payment amount-
ing to P 416 million in October.
(b) Proceeds of the P 500 million NEA equity for relending to electric
cooperatives expected to be released to NPC before year-end.
(c) Government support.
(d) NPC's continued collection efforts.

Ui. Accounts Payable
A. NPC Fuel Pavables. CY 1985 - CY 1987
NPC fuel payables has decreased substantially from 1 7,074 million in
1985 to 1 2,627 million in 1987, or about 1 4,447 million. This improvement
was achieved due to the combined effects of the following cost-cutting/cash-
saving measures which were undertaken by NPC:
(a) Improvement in Generation Mix
NPC has continuously endeavored to reduce its oil dependence through
the shift from the more expensive oil-based generation to cheaper
nonoil based generation, thereby resulting to savings in oil expendi-
tures.
(b) Reduction in Capital Expenditures
NPC has deferred the construction of new and low priority projects in
xiew of the general tight money situation that prevailed beginning
1985. As such, funds which were otherwise allocated for capital
expenditures were used in reducing NPC's fuel payables.
(c) Nondeposit to CB Blocked Account
NPC stopped depositing to the CB Blocked Account sometime in July
1985, debt-servicing of loans which were covered by the Restructuring
Agreement between the Government and the foreign creditoes. This
provided NPC further relief in its cash position starting 1985.
(d) Transfer of PNPP to the National Government
Pursuant to Executive Order No. 55 dated November 4, 1986 as amended
by Executive Order No. 98 dated December 18, 1986, PkPP's debt-
service obligations as of June 30, I9C6 were assumed by the National
Government. Furthermore, NPC's outstanding fuel payables to
Petrophil as of June 30, 1986 amounting to about 1 4.5 billion were
also assumed by the National Government effective the same date.
(e) Reduction in NPC's Oil Inventory Level
In order to reduce carrying costs associated with maintaining big
inventory levels, NPC has embarked on reducing its inventory level
from thirty (30) days to fifteen (15) days beginning from the last
quarter of 1985 to the first quarter of 1986. This was later
abandoned by NPC, however, due to its adverse effects on its
operations particularly during periods of peak energy demand.
(f) NPC's Oil Importation
As a means to further preserve/maximize its cash resources, NPC made
some direct oil importation in 1986. This enabled NPC to purchase
oil at a cheaner cost and longer credit term. This Dractice. how-

ever, has been discontinued temporarily as it became more expensive
during 1987.
(g)  Imaroved Collection of Accounts Receivables
Additional collections were effected through the following effortss
tl) Extension ot 32 discount privilege to delinquent customers
subject to certain conditions.
(ii) Filing in court of collection cases against delinquent custom-
ers, forcing them to enter into amicable settlement with NPC to
pay.
(iii) A Restructuring Arrangement with HERALCO on its overdue account
amounting to 1 1,716 million vas signed subject to MERALCO's
front-end payment of 1 916 million.
(iv) NPC sought the assistance of Government agencies such as Bureau
of Treasury, Department of Finance, Office of Budget Manageme:nt
to effect offsetting of accounts with the Government customers
who receive equity allotments from the Government.
(v) NPC sought the assistance of NEA through NEA's lending of 4' 500
million loan from its funds to electric cooperatives so that
they could liquidate arrearages with NPC.
(vi) NPC sought ways and means to secure compliance of the restruc-
turing agreement and automatic disconnections, except for areas
where peace and order situation is threatened. Corollary to
this, NPC has also sought the cooperation of Government
officials to eliminate political intervention.
NPC will endeavor to maintain the current status of its fuel payabies
by continuously observing the above measures, whenever applicable, and by.
adopting new and appropriate ones in the future.

PHILIPPINES
BACON MANITO GEOTHERMAL POWER PROJECT
PNOC And Affiliates and PNOC-EDCs Assumitions on Financial Proiections
1. Bases
The bases underlying the financial projections are contained in Annex
4.04.
2. Income Statements of PNOC-EDC
Revenues of PNOC-EDC are computed considering the following vari-
ablest
-    Load Factor:  75Z
-    Unit Prices   The price of steam used (1986 terms) are as follows:
Tongonan I       0.5395 P/kWh
Palinpinon I     0.51kg P/kwH
Bacman I         0.6120 P/kWh (on stream in 1991)
Bacman II        0.6.50 PlkWh (on stream in 1993)
Pinatubo         0.6150 P/kWh (on stream in 1993)
Palinpinon II    0.6150 P/kWh (on stream in 1992)
Bacman II and Pinatubo could be substituted by Tongonan II and III,
depending upon the relative economic advantages of the alternatives.
Field Maintenance Costs. The costs cover work-over of xells, well
replacement, maintenance of steam-gathering system and cost of field staff.
Investment Amortization. Amortization is done over a 25-year life.
Foreian Exchante Amortization.  This is particularly relevant tO the
Tongonan and Palinpinon investments, where OECF loans were used and foreign
exchange losses on outstanding amounts of the loans are amortized in future
periods over the remaining lives of the properties. In regard to non-produc-
ing properties, foreign exchange losses are added to the exploratory and
development costs.
'Others' under operating costs of PNOC-EDC refer to drilling
expenses.
G and A costs pertain to general and administration, including over-
heads allocated from PNOC headquarters office.
Interest Charges. Interest during construction is capitalized. On
commencement of production, annual interest payable on loans specifically
availed of for an area is charged off. On common loans to PNOC, not identi-

fied with any specific area, an elaborate allocation is made as between non-
producing and producing areas and in a second stage, the allocation to the
producing areas in sub-allocated among the different producing areas. Accumu-
lated interest in non-producing areas is charged off over 25 years when pro-
duction commences in each area.
Government Take/Income Tax. This has been sufficiently explained in
Chapters III and IV.
3. Income Statement of PNOC
The accounting principles and formulas followed by the different
affiliates are far too numerous to elaborate. No deviation from extant rules
has been made in making the financial projections.
4. Balance Sheets - PNOC
Debt/Equity Ratio. Exploration expenditure is taken as being
financed by equity contributions from PNOC, with a one-year time lag. The
condition of debtlequity being within 70:30, which is proposed is seen to be
fulfilled.
Trade Receivables. Credit periods are taken at 45 days, with inter-
est charges due at 122 thereafter.
Investments. These are estimated on a field-by-field basis with
spreads over the years as would be optimal for synchronization with offtake of
steam by NPC.
5. Balance Sheets - PNOC
The consolidated balance sheet, as explained in the text takes note
of gradual increases in petroleum product sales, reduction in coal volumes and
increasing geothermal investments.
The major borrowings of PNOC are assumed to be the proposed loan and
a follow on loan in 1991 for development of two new geothermal fields (2 x 110
6. Sources and Application of Funds - PNOC-EDC
Equity increases, onlending of the proposed loan to PNOC-EDC by PNOC,
onlending of a similar future loan, inter-company advances to support local
currency requirements for development have been provided for. Onlending terms
for the two foreign loans have been taken as the standard terms of Bank loan
ror Philippines.
7. Internal Cash Generation - PNOC
The Energy Regulatory Board, it has been assumed, will maintain oil
company margins between average product price and price of imported crude at
existing levels.



- 121 -
ANNEX 4.07
Page 3 of 3
Coal prices are not expected to change from the low levels of 1987.
Capital expenditure will be largely covered by the balance of the ADB
loan for the refinery and the coastal fleet, by the balance of the IBRD loan
for geothermal exploration, tr the proposed IBRD loan and by a new loan for
geothermal field development in 1991 or about.
