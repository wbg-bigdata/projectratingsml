MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE
TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT OF ETHIOPIA FOR A
NATIONAL FERTILIZER SECTOR PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) for SDR 82.9 million
(US$120.0 million equivalent) on standard terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance a
National Fertilizer Sector Project (NFSP).
Country and Sector Background
2.     Ethiopia. with a population of 54.8 million, is Sub-Saharan Africa's second most populous
country. Its social indicators are among the lowest in the world. The 1994 per capita GDP is
US$125 and the infant mortality rates are higher than the regional and global average; there is a
growing chronic protein energy malnutrition, and some 60 percent of the urban population lives in
poverty.
3.     Ethiopia's political and economic structures have been subject to repeated and profound
changes in the past decades. In 1974, a revolution put an end to monarchy and feudalism and
introduced state control over investment, production and trade. In the following years, a continuing
civil vwar further crippled the economy. The socialist regime was replaced in 1991 by TGE which
announced a new economic policy, signaling a move towards a market-oriented, decentralized
economic system in which private sector initiatives would dominate. The bold economic reforms
implemented since mid- 1991 include a major devaluation of the Ethiopian Birr, deregulation of the
transport sector, initiatives towards parastatal reform, and deregulation of most prices, including
food grain prices.
4.     The ongoing Emergency Recovery and Reconstruction Project (ERRP), Credit 2351-ET,
represents TGE's first major step to support economic recovery in the short term. The beneficial
impact of ERRP is already evident in several sectors. For instance, in the agriculture sector,
import assistance by IDA and some donors resulted in an increase in fertilizer consumption of
some 40 percent which became a major factor, combined with good weather, in contributing to the
record cereal production in 1992. TGE is also being assisted by IDA, and other donors, through a
Structural Adjustment Credit (CR. 2526-ET). TGE has also reached agreement with IDA and
IMF on the subsequent phase of reform presented in the Third Policy Framework Paper, negotiated
in September 1994 for the period 1994-95 to 1996-97. The bi-weekly auction of foreign exchange
by the National Bank of Ethiopia has been working satisfactorily since May 1993.
5.    TGE is of the view that because of the dominant role of the agricultural sector in the
economy, accounting for about 55 percent of GDP at factor cost, 60 percent of commodity exports,
and 80 percent of employment, this sector is, and will, remain the engine of economic growth for
some time to come. About 6 million smallholders, with holdings averaging at about one hectare,
produce 90 percent of food grains, pulses and oilseeds, as well as 98 percent of the coffee--the
principal foreign exchange earner. The state farms contribute the rest, while the large privately
operated farms were, until very recently, non-existent.



-2-
6.     Crop yields are low to very low (about 1.2 tons per hectare for main cereals, 0.6 tons for
pulses and 0.5 tons for oilseeds) because of inadequate fertilizer application rates (only seven
kilograms of nutrient per hectare, as compared to the world average of 97 kilograms, and 48
kilograms for neighboring Kenya), poor quality of seed, inadequate dissemination of technology,
infrastructural deficiencies, and until recently, lack of incentives for farmers due to government
control over the input and output markets and prices. There is good potential to raise the yields of
food grains and other crops by 50 to 100 percent. The blanket, country-wide fertilizer use
recommendation of two bags of DAP and one bag of urea per hectare for all crops, in all agro-
ecological situations, lacks scientific underpinnings. These are now being revised and made
consistent with the results of country-wide fertilizer trials data. The country has no soil fertility
maps, and there is no soil testing service. Also, there are emerging problems of maintaining the
long-term fertility of soils, preventing soil erosion and degradation, and combating acidity in about
30 percent of the cropped area. Indigenous resources like lime, animal dung and bones (Ethiopia
supports the highest livestock population of Africa) which could help mitigate the soil fertility
problems, have remained unused.
7.     TGE recognizes that the need to increase food production, both in the immediate future
and in the medium term, is of paramount importance, not only for food security and poverty
alleviation, but also to expand agricultural exports and stimulate overall growth in the economy.
The country's food deficit, currently about 0.8 million tons, is estimated to rise to 1.8 million tons
in the next five years, even assuming a base growth, to be realized without incremental fertilizer,
of about 3 percent per year. Food imports to meet such a large deficit would impose an
unsustainable burden on the country's foreign exchange resources and available port capacity in
Asseb (Eritrea) and Djibouti, as well as on the county's road and rail network, the transportation
fleet and the storage infrastructure.
8.     The strategy to increase food grain production in the short to medium term would have to
rcly primarily on raising the productivity of land, since significant area expansion is not an
effective alternative because of social, economic and environmental costs of opening up new land,
and the lengthv lead time required. An appropriate strategy to increase yield would comprise an
increased and more widespread use of fertilizers in conjunction with improved seed and sound
agronomic practices. Profitability of fertilizer use in most situations is well established by more
than two decades of, donor-assisted, country-wvide trials, and there is general awareness among the
peasants about the benefits of fertilizer use. It is estimated that fertilizer use would have to grow at
an annual rate of 17 percent to contain the annual food deficit at the present level. This growth
rate is considered feasible since the present use of fertilizer is extremely low (para. 6), and only one
out of five farmers uses it. TGE has already announced the National Fertilizer Policy (November
1993) and has confirmed its commitment to liberalize the whole system of fertilizer imports and
domestic marketing by up-front actions, including allowing equal opportunity to the private sector
in imports and marketing of fertilizer and turning the Agricultural Inputs Supply Corporation
(AISCO)--the monopolist fertilizer importing and distribution parastatal--into an autonomous
entity, with its own board of directors, subject to hard budget constraint and competition from the
private sector. The significance of these actions is evident from the fact that in the 1993 fertilizer
season. about 68 percent of all fertilizer was sold to smallholders through private retailers
appointed by AISCO, against zero percentage until 1991. Some further changes in the balance
between public and private sectors are beginning to emerge; the most significant of these is that
now fcrtilizer is also imported, albeit, still on a limited scale, by the private sector which distributes
the fertilizer through its own nctwork of appointed dealers. Since 1994, the farmers' access to



-3-
seasonal input loans has also considerably improved; the Commeicial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE),
with its country-wide branch network, has reopened its inputs credit line after a gap of six years.
CBE's recovery performance in the past has been satisfactory--generally above 85 percent. In
addition, CBE is already extending credit to fertilizer importers, both in the public and the private
sectors, while the interested small traders can get loans against collateral, in addition to informal
credit from the importers and distributors. These measures, together with TGE's planned phasing
out of price controls by September 30, 1998, and the elimination, by September 30, 1996, of the
general, across-the-board fertilizer price subsidy which was introduced to soften the impact of
massive devaluation of the Ethiopian Birr in 1993, and complete elimination of even the targeted
price subsidies by September 30, 1998, should set the stage for a significant growth in fertilizer
use.
Project Objectives
9.     The project objective is to contribute to accelerated and sustainable growth in agricultural
production and productivity with a view to improving food security and reducing poverty. The
project would achieve this by (a) supporting policy reforms to create an enabling environment for
the growth of a competitive fertilizer sector; (b) supporting, institutional and human resource
capacity building; (c) implementing strategies which enhance effective fertilizer demand and match
them with adequate supplies through competitive imports and domestic marketing; and (d)
promoting initiatives to maintain and improve the long-term  fertility of Ethiopian soils, and
ensuring environmental conservation. By the end of the projcct life, i.e., by the year 2000, it is
envisaged that the Ethiopian fertilizer sector would have movecd from a state controlled to a largely
liberalized system, with active participation of private impdrtets., distributors, wholesalers and
retailers in a progressively competitive price and trade environment. This, in turn, is expected to
contribute significantly to enhanced food security at both the national and the farm household
levels, improved management of the Ethiopian soils and the strengthening of fertilizer-related
institutions in terms of infrastructure and skills of staff.
Project Description
10.    Policy Environment: The realization of the project objectives would critically depend
upon the existence of a conducive policy environment. Therefore, agreement has been reached with
TGE that the fertilizer policy reform process would continue during the project life. More
specifically, this agreement includes: (a) elimination of general, across-the-board fertilizer price
subsidies by September 30, 1996 and elimination of targeted subsidies by September 30, 1998; (b)
phased deregulation of fertilizer prices to be completed by December 31, 1998; (c) provision of
equal opportunity to the private sector in the area of foreign exchange allocation for fertilizer
imports as well as domestic marketing; (d) elimination of all preferential treatment to AISCO--the
fertilizer parastatal--and replacement by 1997 of its 500 marketing centers with private and
cooperative wholesalers, providing fertilizer retailing only through private and cooperative
channels; and finally (e) introduction of a regulatory franiework to ensure industry-wide fair
trading practices.
11.    Project Components: In addition to supporting the policy environment, the three project
components are (a) Capacity Building (US$5.9 million ); (b) Fertilizer Use Prdmotion and Supply
Management, including fertilizer imports (USS216.2 million); and (c) Soil Fertility Management
and Environmental Conservation (US$8.3 million). In the capacity building component, the project



-4-
would upgrade the implementation capacity of participating institutions and ministries, which
would include the recently created National Fertilizer Industry Agency or NFIA (responsible for
overseeing and guiding the development of the fertilizer sector), relevant divisions like agricultural
extension and rural technology promotion in the Ministry of Agriculture, the National
Microbiological Laboratory for production of biofertilizers, and the Ethiopian Standards Authority
for fertilizer law and its enforcement. In addition to institutional strengthening, the project would
also support human resource development with a focus on local capacity building, primarily
through training and technical assistance. With regard to the second component on fertilizer use
promotion and supply management, the project would support a whole range of initiatives to
promote efficient, balanced and greater fertilizer use by the farmers, so as to raise the consumption
level from the current average of about 161,000 tons to 360,000 tons in five years. Fertilizer
imports would comprise 70 percent of the total project costs and  IDA would finance some 67
percent of the incremental fertilizer imports. Demand generation would be backed by fertilizer
availability of the right type and quantity, at the right place and time, and at competitive prices.
The fertilizer supply management component addresses the entire range of issues including
fertilizer imports (Ethiopia does not produce any chemical fertilizer), their timeliness and
adequacy, logistical issues for distribution from the ship to the farm, and development of
transparent mechanisms to ensure that the foreign exchange made available by IDA, other donors
and the National Bank of Ethiopia is shared equitably by the private and the public sectors. The
third component on soil fertility management and environmental conservation supports a number of
pilot initiatives towards an integrated plant nutrient supply system, including biogas development,
biofertilizers production and distribution, and establishment of eight simple soil testing laboratories
at specific locations to serve the farmers; in addition, the component supports measures, such as
training in safe fertilizer handling and application techniques, as well as monitoring of pollution
levels in river streams to safeguard the environment against the adverse effects (if any) of fertilizcr
use.
12.    Financing, Procurement and Disbursement: The project would be financed by IDA
(US$120.0 million), TGE (US$20.4 million) and public and private fertilizer importers,
distributors, wholesalers and retailers (US$90.0 million). The importers would put up the local
currency to get foreign exchange from the National Bank of Ethiopia at the official rate of
exchange. A significant part of this foreign exchange is likely to bc made available by donors.
The project would allow for retroactive financing of fertilizer imports for a total of up to 10
percent of the proposed IDA credit. The rationale for this support stems from the fact that thc
project is cxpected to become effective at the peak of the fertilizer season in July 1995, and given
the logistical necessity of organizing fertilizer imports a few months prior to the anticipated date of
sale, the procurement of fertilizer and its arrival in the country must precede credit effectiveness.
Moreover, unlike in past years, the 1995 fertilizer season would begin with very low fertilizer
inventories within the country, with a potential risk of jeopardizing the progress in the privatization
of the marketing system. Project costs and financing, procurement and disbursement arrangements
are summarized, in a tabular form, in Schedules A and B. The timetable of key project processing
events is given in Schedule C, and the status of Bank Group Operations is given in Schedule D.
The Staff Appraisal Report No. 13722-ET is being distributed separately. A map is also attached.



-5-
Project Implementation
13.    The project does not propose any new institutions or agencies to be created for the project
implementation; the activities envisaged under the various components would be implemented by
the concerned department/division in the line ministries, or by the concerned public or private
sector agency. The overall responsibility for project implementation would rest with the recently
created National Fertilizer Industry Agency (NFIA), designated to provide effective guidance and
institutional linkages for the coordinated development of the fertilizer sector. NFIA would develop
a strong data base, organize and coordinate training and awareness programs, as well as an annual
workshop, monitor the national and international fertilizer situation, and ensure effective
implementation of NFSP, through its Project Coordination and Monitoring Office (PCMO).
14.    NFIA would be IDA's counterpart agency with a coordination and monitoring role, and
would be assisted by a Project Implementation Advisor and one specialist each in Management
Information Systems and Marketing, to be hired before project effectiveness; they would assist
NFIA in developing appropriate management systems, procedures and controls within the
organization. Among the implementing agencies, the Ministry of Agriculture would have a central
role in promoting efficient and greater fertilizer use, and facilitating a gradual shift towards an
integrated plant nutrient supply system. The extension set-up of the regional agriculture bureaus
would, through specific programs, initiate farmers into the use of fertilizer, promote biogas,
provide soil testing services and training to farners. In the public sector, AISCO would implement
its restructuring plan agreed with IDA, and phase out its marketing centers to the private
wholesalers by 1997. Fertilizer importation and marketing would be the responsibility of fertilizer
trade in the public and private sector, with both operating on a level playing field. AISCO has
already appointed over 1,000 private cooperative retailers, while the private importer has also
appointed over 500 retailers. The setting of fertilizer quality standards would be the responsibility
of the Ethiopian Standards Authority, while the responsibility for its enforcement would rest with
the field staff of the regional agricultural bureaus. The National Soils Service (NSS) would
provide technical backstopping for the eight field soil testing laboratories, while the Microbiology
Laboratory would implement the biofertilizer program. All capacity building, including training,
study tours, technical assistance, and fellowships, would be coordinated and supervised by NFIA.
Project Sustainability
15.    Project sustainability would not be contingent on the provision of government budgetary
allocations. All fertilizer imports would continue to be funded by the private and the public sector
importers, with foreign exchange being made available by the National Bank of Ethiopia against
deposit of local currency. The soil testing service is expected to start cost recovery by charging
farmers after project year three for its services.  Similarly, biofertilizers produced at the
Microbiological Laboratory, would be sold at commercial rates, after an introductory period of two
years. The biogas beneficiaries would finance the installation of biogas units through their own
ontributions and loans from the banking sector; this is expected to continue beyond project
completion date. Fertilizer marketing, including handling, transport and storage would be paid by
the trade from the start of the project. NFIA, with a relatively small budget, would continue to be
funded from TGE's recurrent budget.

Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement
16.   In view of the reversal of the policies of the previous Govern-ment from 1974 to 1990 and
the adoption of a market-based approach to economic development by TGE, the lessons of IDA
funded projects implemented during the earlier regimes do not nave much relevance. However,
there is relevant experience across countries, and the lessons from that experience have been used
in the design of the project. The African experience relates to the fertilizer projects in Malawi,
Kenya and Uganda; important lessons also stem from Bangladesh and Pakistan.
17.    For Malawi, it was concluded that: (a) prior to lending, the Bank should have sought
commitment from the Government on fostering commercialization of fertilizer procurement and
distribution, with proper supervisory and regulatory roles for the MOA or one of its agencies; and
(b) the project should have been less ambitious in its objectives of policy reform and should have
been limited to promoting a commercialized distribution system. The lesson from the Ugandan and
Kenyan experience is that macro-economic adjustment is, by itself, not enough to generate an
immediate and adequate private sector response in the fertilizer sector; it takes much longer time to
create a conducive environment and build private sector confidence in the continuity ..-. government
policies. Fertilizer projects in Bangladesh and Pakistan helped ease constraints and laid the
foundation for efficient fertilizer supply and distribution; but more focus was, however, required on
training the staff of the fertilizer planning and monitoring secretariat in Bangladesh. These lessons
have been incorporated into the design of the proposed project.
Country Assistance Strategy and Rationale for IDA Involvement
IX.    The project is an integral part of the IDA's Country Assistance Strategy which is
designed to respond directly to a key concern of the Ethiopian authorities. The latter is to reduce
the vulnerabilitv of the rural population to famine. Food security would be pursued through a
concentrated effort to increase productivity of smallholder agriculture. One of the major objectives
of IDA's country assistance strategy is to improve food security on a sustainable basis. Economic
groxwth is the essential basis of a long-term strategy to reduce poverty through increased
employment and food production. The aim of the Bank's program is to support this growth
stratcgy through a series of important measures, which include a policy framework to stimulate
production. exports. and private sector growsth; a reliable flow of il puts for the productive sectors;
cssential improvcment and expansion of infrastructure; environmental rehabilitation and
conservation; and institutional capacity essential for economic growth.  The proposed project
would ensure the  supplv of the most critically required input, namely fertilizer, to raise
agricultural production and productivity and thercby support TGE's strategic goal of food security.
IDA had carlier supportcd the import of fertilizer as a part of its ongoing program
through PADEP I (Cr. 1956-ET). and more recently under ERRP (Cr. 235 1-ET). The fertilizer
project complcmcni3 the proposed Seed Systems Development Project, as fertilizer and seed are the
critical inputs roquired for a rapid growth in agriculture. TGE's ownership and commitment is
strong for this p -oiect. as evidenced by the National Fertilizer Industry Policy, as well as the major
up-front reforn . undertaken with regard to the importation and domestic marketing of fertilizers
and thc establishment of NFIA.



-7 -
Agreed Actions
19.    Prior to negotiations, TGE had agreed on policy reform issues relating to fertilizer prices,
subsidies, market liberalization and the role of AISCO and had started implementation thereof.
TGE has also taken up-front actions and allowed imports and domestic marketing of fertilizers by
the private, sector, and treated the public and the private sector equally in the allocation of foreign
exchange for fertilizer imports. It has also converted AISCO into a commercial enterprise with its
own board of directors.
20.   At negotiations, TGE reconfirmed its policies relating to phased deregulation of prices and
complete elimination of fertilizer price subsidies by September 30, 1998, and assured that it would
provide equal opportunities to the public and private sectors in the matter of foreign exchange
availability, credit for fertilizer importation and domestic marketing, channelling of subsidies,
domestic marketing of fertilizers, membership of all project-related committees, participation in
workshops, seminars and study tours. Further, apart from agreeing to the procurement, reporting
(including an ICR, business plans and operational plans), and audit requirements of IDA for each
implementing agency, TGE has also assured that (a) the project would be implemented according
to the Project Implementation Plan, and that the Government would provide the requisite budgetary
and staff support to NFIA to ensure smooth implementation and that AISCO would diligently
implement the plans to privatize its marketing centers operations; (b) NFIA would coordinate
fertilizer import and inland distribution operations and resolve all issues which impede efficiency,
cost competitiveness or interfere with adequate and timely availability of fertilizers within the
country; (c) the Government would update/develop standards and tolerance limits for fertilizer
products and packaging materials and put in place enforcement mechanisms to regulate fertilizer
quality and packaging standards and facilitate licensing of private clearing and forwarding agents;
(d) NFIA would furnish to IDA an annual work program for all project components, including
procurement, technical assistance, training, biofertilizers and soil testing, two months prior to the
beginning of each year starting from Project Year 2; (e) NFIA would hold a mid-term review
jointly with IDA to comprehensively review project performance and agree on future course of
actions--such a review would also include plans for commercialization of biofertilizer programs
and introduction of cost recovery for soil testing service; (f) NFIA would organize a benchmark
survey in Project Year-1, and an annual impact assessment survey thereafter throughout the life of
the project; (g) NFIA would put in place a project financial management and accounting system by
December 1995; and (h) NFIA would finalize with IDA details of arrangements to maintain a data
base regarding the impact of fertilizer on the environment, and establish a monitoring and testing
program for strategic locations by December 31, 1996.
21.    TGE has further agreed on the following conditions of credit effectiveness: (a) AISCO
will submit to IDA (i) a phased action plan for complete privatization of its marketing centers by
December 31, 1997; (ii) a business plan for 1995, acceptable to IDA, including guidelines on
fertilizer pricing for distributors, wholesalers and retailers; (b) NFIA will (i) furnish its annual
work program for 1995-96 acceptable to IDA; (ii) recruit a project implementation advisor and a
specialist each in fertilizer MIS and marketing, with qualifications, experience and terms and
conditions of employment satisfactory to IDA; (iii) furnish evidence satisfactory to IDA that the
Project Coordination and Monitoring Office has been made fully operational; and (c) furnish
evidence that the fertilizer inputs units have been established in regional bureaus of agriculture to
coordinate and monitor the project implementation at the regional level.



-8-
Poverty Category
22.    Even though NFSP is not a poverty-targeted intervention, the project would directly help
small holders, who produce 90 percent of foodgrains, pulses and oilseeds, by raising their incomes
through enhanced crop production and productivity levels.
Environmental Aspects
23.    Environmental category is B. There is, at present, negligible risk of pollution to ground
water and river streams, given that fertilizer use in Ethiopia is at an extremely low level, and there
are no large areas of intensive irrigated farming to benefit from the project. Even on project
completion, fertilizer use levels in Ethiopia would be less than 20 percent of the world average, and
less than half of those prevailing in Kenya. Despite this low risk, the project design includes
several precautionary measures, including training of dealers and extension agents in safer methods
of fertilizer handling, storage and application, as well as setting up of a mechanism to monitor
pollution levels in river streams and ground water.
Program Objective Categories
24.    The project relates well to IDA's Program Objective Categories. The project is expected to
improve the management of the public sector monopoly--AISCO--by fostering competition, making
it autonomous and responsible to its Board of Directors, and subject to hard budget constraint,
without any explicit or hidden subsidies. The project would also promote private sector
development, ranging from import to retailing of fertilizers, by removing all restrictions and
creating a level playing field. The project would contribute to the realization of IDA's poverty
reduction goal, as the ultimate beneficiaries of the project are the smallholders. These smallholders
would have improved access to fertilizer, which would be offered at competitive prices; they would
also benefit from improved support by the strengthened extension services, mimikit program to
annually initiate some 15,000 smallholders into balanced fertilizer use, and from the soil testing
facilities. In addition, the fertilizer-related environmental concems would be addressed by the
project through various initiatives aimed at maintaining the long-term fertility of soils and reducing
environmental degradation.  Finally, the project would address the gender issue through the
provision of family-size biogas units; it would thereby reduce the drudgery of women in collecting
firewood or preparing dung cakes (to be used as cooking fuel); the use of biogas would further
result in a smoke-free, and thus cleaner and healthier, cooking environment to benefit all household
members.
Participatory Approach
25.    TGE has been deeply involved in the preparation and finalization of project proposals.
While TGE accepted the assistance of FAO-IC during the initial preparation of the project that was
proposed for donor financing, its own officials and non-officials actively participated in and
contributed to the project ideas. Thereafter, TGE set up a task force, with membership drawn from
agricultural research, extension, science and technology commission, and concerned ministries
including roads and transport, to develop a National Fertilizer Policy. The chairman of this task
force acted as the counterpart of IDA's appraisal mission which visited Ethiopia in July 1993. The
appraisal mission closely interacted with the task force as an integral part of capacity building



-9-
envisaged under the project. In addition, a series of consultations and meetings were organized
with the private sector, some of them through the local chambers of commerce, to develop realistic
project proposals. During their extensive field visits to different parts of the country, IDA missions
consulted with farmers individually and in groups, as well as through the traditional village level
farmer organizations. IDA missions also interacted closely with the local extension agencies
during their field visits. The final project proposals, therefore, reflect the ideas which emerged
through the participation of various possible actors and beneficiaries during project preparation
and appraisal. Finally, the project proposals in the Staff Appraisal Report were reviewed in detail
by TGE with officials in the concerned institutions and ministries, as well as the National Bank of
Ethiopia.   This participatory and consensus building approach, which has been followed
throughout the project processing, is expected to create an environment which would be conducive
for successful project implementation.
Project Benefits
26.    The benefits from satisfactory project implementation would be several. First, increased
fertilizer use would improve crop productivity; on an average, each ton of fertilizer used would
result in an estimated increase in food grain production of five tons. It is estimated that the project
would help in the production of an incremental 2.6 million tons of grains during the project life.
The Benefit Cost ratio has been estimated to be 3.4, and the Net Present Value of the Project is
US$394 million at a discount rate of 10 percent. Second, the project would annually initiate some
5,000 smallholders into fertilizer use, and another 10,000 farmers into a more balanced fertilizer
use. Third, introduction of smaller fertilizer packings of 10 and 25 kg, against the current
standard packing of 50 kg bags, would bring farmers, with small holdings, and/or living in difficult
to reach locations, within the mainstream of fertilizer users. These benefits would contribute in
alleviating poverty and improving national and household food security.  Fourth, increased
fertilizer availability would generate both on-farm and off-farm employment; the latter in the
fertilizer trading and transport sector. Fifth, the project would, through pilot initiatives, help
address concerns associated with the maintenance of long-term soil fertility and environmental
conservation. The biogas program would directly benefit the farm women by providing them with
a more efficient and smoke free cooking environment, thereby releasing a considerable amount of
women's time for child care and/or income generating activities. Finally, the project would assist
the TGE in building up an institutional framework which would enable the establishment of a
sustainable fertilizer import and marketing system.
Project Risks
27.    There are three main risks associated with the project.  These risks relate to (a) the
economic environment, including the ongoing systemic changes in economic, political, and
administrative structures, and the devolution of powers to the regions; (b) possible inadequate or
slow response of the private sector to the opportunities created by TGE's reforms in the fertilizer
sector; and (c) inadequate donor response leading to lower than anticipated fertilizer imports.
28.    The first risk, though real, is not rated high because it would be declining over time, and
furthermore, there appears to be no viable alternatives for TGE or any successor government to
change the course or speed of reform. Risk of the second category is considered minimal, given
last year's experience with private retailers in the marketing of fertilizer. Further, once the
country's political, economic and administrative reorganization is completed, the private sector is



-10-
likely to gain confidence and increasingly venture into fertilizer business.  Risk of the third
category is not rated high as there are strong indications of adequate donor interest in the sector,
provided TGE keeps its macro-economic reform program on track. Also, the National Fertilizer
Policy commits TGE to providing the foreign exchange needed for fertilizer importation.
Recommendation
29.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of Agreement for the
Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

ETHIOPIA - IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES
The performance of the portfolio of ongoing projects has been affected by the complex nature of
the political evolution in Ethiopia. Before the change of government in 1991, the portfolio consisted
largely of projects which included monopoly parastatals and were designed to be implemented through a
centralized system of administration. Large parts of the country were not covered due to lack of access
during the civil strife. Following the change of government, the first priority was to restructure the
existing projects.
Of the five problem projects (all from the previous regime) in the FY94 portfolio, the Forestry
project was closed (June 1994), the Small Scale Irrigation project has been upgraded and the Market
Town project is being upgraded following project restructuring. As a result, only two problem projects
remain, namely Peasant Agricultural Development (PADEP I) and Second Addis Urban Development
(SAUD). A supervision mission of April-May 1995 is reviewing the restructuring plan and will propose
actions for the PADEP I. The SAUD's restructuring is largely complete and the remnaining step is
confirmation that water tariff increases will be implemented in May 1995.
'the portfolio is leaner, more focused and meets the priorities of the TGE. Disbursements on
investment projects increased from US$91 million in FY93 to US$146 million in FY94 (including the
ERRP). The overall disbursement factor rose from 15.6 percent in FY93 to 24.9 percent in FY94,
attributable to effective implementation of the ERRP, without which there was a slight decline from 15.1
percent to 13.7 percent. The total undisbursed balance for investment projects was reduced from US$589
million in June 1993 to US$412 million as of December 1994.
In addition to difficulties caused by the need to restructure old projects and redefine projects'
ownership and administrative structure, there have been problems in procurement, disbursements and
special accounts. Training workshops on procurement and disbursement issues for senior government
officials, including regional officials, were conducted in 1994 and 1995. A comprehensive Country
Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) was carried out in March 1995. At its conclusion, understandings
were reached to correct the overdue audit situation, progress was made on resolving the problem of
inactive special accounts, and an action plan was designed to improve implementation of problem
projects.
A first adjustment operation, SAC I (US$250 million) was approved by the Board in June 1993
and became effective in July 1993. Disbursement of the first tranche was completed in January 1995, but
there has been some delay in meeting a number of the second tranche conditions, particularly regarding
the privatization process. However, a Bank review mission that visited Ethiopia in March 1995 found that
substantial progress was made since January in putting up for sale state-owned retail shops, hotels and
restaurants. These and other findings of the mission are currently being evaluated prior to the release of
the second tranche.
