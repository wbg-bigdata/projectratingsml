MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS REGULATION AND PRIVATIZATION SUPPORT
PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for US$35.0 million equivalent to help finance a
Telecommunications Regulation and Privatization Support Project. The proposed loan will be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 20 years including five years of grace. The
proceeds of the development loan would be used for the establishment of a Pakistan Telecommunications
Authority (PTA), for telecommunications sector regulation, and a Frequency Allocation Board (FAB), for
radio frequency management and monitoring, and to support the GOP's telecommunications sector reform
program.
2.         Country/Sector Background. Since the late 1980s successive governments in Pakistan have
been implementing a comprehensive reform program emphasizing outward orientation of the economy,
private investment, and wide-ranging structural reforms to increase savings and investment as well as
improving overall economic efficiency. The economy has responded well to these policies, although recent
GDP growth of less then 4% in 1992-95 has been constrained by the impact of exogenous factors on the
agricultural sector and by related difficulties in the manufacturing sector. Near-to-medium-term growth
prospects will require an acceleration of reforms to increase competitiveness in cotton and cotton
manufactures and exploit potential new sources of growth in the manufacturing sector.
3.         Sector Background. In the late 1980's, the Pakistan Telegraph and Telephone Department
(T&T) operated about 650,000 telephone lines or about 0.6 lines per 100 population. The waiting list for
telephone connections exceeded 550,000 and the expected waiting period for connection was nearly 10
years, one of the longest in the world. The call completion rate for local calls was about 35% and only
about 12% for domestic trunk and international calls, which indicated a poorer service quality in Pakistan
than in nearly all other Asian countries.
4.         Realizing the importance of adequate telecommunications as an essential business tool, GOP
decided to restructure the telecommunications sector. Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation (PTC)
was created out of the former T&T Department through the 1991 PTC Act. At the same time, the
telecommunications market, except for basic voice services, was opened up to the private sector, and
operating licenses were granted to cellular, paging, data transmission, subscriber equipment and card phone
companies. As from its creation, PTC embarked on an ambitious expansion program. PTC's exchange
capacity increased from about 1,460,000 lines in 1991 to about 2,800,000 by mid-1995. The connection of
new subscribers has, however, lagged the installation of new lines. In mid-1995, PTC had about 2,200,000
subscribers, for a 1.71% telephone density. While this penetration is comparatively low, it is a marked
increase from the 0.8% density of 1991. The accelerated expansion in recent years has allowed PTC to
connect most of the subscribers waiting for service. With the installation of new lines, pending demand fell
from about 670,000 in 1991 to about 210,000 lines in June 1995.
5.         GOP's current strategy includes: restructuring the telecommunications sector to improve its
performance and relieving a constraint on the development of the economy; privatizing PTC to help inject



-2-
private sector capital and skills into the main service provider; and redefining GOP's role from sector
operator to regulator. For this purpose, GOP retained a consortium of consultants in 1991 to advise them
on the restructuring of the telecommunications sector. Based on the consortium's recommendations, GOP in
July 1994 issued the necessary enabling legislation to separate the sector's commercial operations from its
regulation and to initiate the privatization of PTC (Telecommunications Ordinance of 1994). The
Ordinance (re-issued in July 1995) provides for the privatization of PTC, through its conversion into a
company (Pakistan Telecommunications Company Ltd., PTCL) and the sale of a substantial part of its
equity to a strategic investor/operator. It also created a Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA), for
the regulation of the sector, and a Frequency Allocation Board (FAB) for the management of the radio
frequency spectrum.
6.         As an interim step, GOP initiated PTC's privatization before its conversion into a company
by selling "PTC Vouchers" that will be convertible into PTCL shares once the necessary legal steps have
been completed for PTCL's creation. The first voucher issue was made in the local market in August 1994
for about 2% of PTC's equity and brought in the equivalent of about US$ 100 million. Due to the success of
this offer, a second issue of about 10% of PTC's equity was made in September 1994, and brought in about
US$900 million from the international market.
7.         Lessons Learned from Previous Bank Operations. The Bank has been involved in five
telecommunications investment projects in Pakistan. The first four projects were successful in expanding
and modernizing the telecommunications network and providing some modest institutional building in the
administrative and accounting areas. The fifth project was successfully completed and closed in December
1993. In addition to network expansion, sector reforms, such as PTC's incorporation, were initiated under
this project and progress was made towards the commercialization of PTC with the passage of the 1991
PTC Act. The main lesson learned is that operating efficiency, e.g. demand satisfaction and service quality,
improves with increased autonomy for the operators. The proposed project would enable the Bank to
continue to play a critical role in the sector reform process, including the privatization of PTC.
8.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The licensing of private providers of cellular, paging, data
transmission and other services and the increased demands on the radio frequency spectrum in general,
have made adequate sector regulation a necessity. The establishment of an effective regulatory system
would be an important step towards the privatization of PTC. Operators and investors need to know how
and by whom the sector will be regulated to plan their activities and project future cash flows. The Bank's
prior involvement in Pakistan's telecommunications sector and its experience with similar projects in
Mexico, Philippines, and Venezuela, makes it well suited to assist GOP in its sector reform efforts and in
the establishment of regulatory systems and institutions. The Bank is also providing technical assistance to
the Privatization Commission (PC), which is in charge of the investment banking aspects of PTC's
privatization. The proposed project will be coordinated with the Bank's support to the PC. The proposed
project is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy, which was discussed by the Executive
Directors on March 31, 1994, and emphasizes support for redefining public/private sector roles, including
privatization of public services and increasing the public sector's ability to regulate a more competitive
environment for the expansion of the private sector. The project is also consistent with the Bank's strategy
in the telecommunications sector, which calls for shifting the Government's role from ownership and
operations to policy making and regulation, promoting efficiency and service quality, and increased private
sector participation in investments and provision of services. Improved and expanded telecommunications
services will contribute to economic growth and poverty alleviation.
9.         Project Objectives. The primary project objective is to support the reform and efficient
development of the Pakistan telecommunications sector by implementing a suitable regulatory framework



-3-
for both public and private telecommunications operators and the efficient allocation and use of the radio
spectrum. More specifically, the project will assist GOP in: (a) the establishment of an adequate legal and
institutional framework for the telecommunications sector; (b) the creation of PTA for sector regulation,
and FAB for management of the radio frequency spectrum; and (c) facilitating increased private sector
participation in sector development, including the privatization of PTC.
10.        Project Description. The main project components are as follows: (i) technical assistance,
through a technical cooperation arrangement to support PTA and FAB during their first year of operation
(about US$ 2.6 million); (ii) consultancy services to assist in the establishment of suitable long-term
strategies regarding tariffs, demand management, quality of service and others to support the privatization
of PTC (US$ 0.7 million); (iii) training of PTA's and FAB's staff (US$ 2.1 million); and (iv) hardware and
software for an integrated radio spectrum management and monitoring system (US$ 26.1 million). Other
project components are: test laboratory, office computers and printers, power supply and civil works
(totalling US$ 7.8 million). Upon project completion, Pakistan will have a complete regulatory system for
the sector, including an adequate licensing regime and radio frequency management.
11.        Project Implementation. The proposed project would be carried out by the Ministry of
Communications (MOC), PTA and FAB. The project cost is estimated at US$53.6 million equivalent, with
a foreign exchange component of US$34.6 million equivalent. Local costs include 40% taxes and custom
duties estimated at about US$14.3 million equivalent. IBRD would finance US$35.0 million equivalent, of
the total project cost of US$53.6 million, covering 100% of the foreign exchange requirements. A Japanese
grant is being utilized to assist in the detailed design of the project, drafting of specifications for equipment
and software, and in the initiation of the proposed sector studies. The breakdown of project cost and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement, and the disbursement
schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank
operations in Pakistan are presented in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 13298, is being circulated separately.
12.        Project Sustainability. The legal basis for PTA and FAB, their staffing and funding and
GOP's commitment to sector reform  are key factors in the sustainability of the project. The
Telecommunications Ordinance of 1994 legally established the regulatory institutions PTA and FAB
including their funding. However, this Ordinance, which was repromulgated in July 1995, is of temporary
nature and GOP intends having the Telecommunications Bill enacted to.provide PTA and FAB with a
permanent legal basis. A Sector Policy Letter and Action Plan indicating GOP's commitment to the sector
reform program has been received and key staff appointments for PTA and FAB were made prior to
negotiations. GOP has budgeted Rs. 50.0 million for the start-up operations and PTA will collect license
and other fees from the service providers, estimated at over Rs. 200.0 million per year, which will ensure
adequate funding outside of the GOP budget of PTA and FAB expenditures estimated at Rs. 60.0 million.
Over the longer run, PTA/FAB's license and other revenues are likely to increase substantially, as existing
service providers expand their operations and new operators are licensed. The importance of the regulatory
institutions will increase in a complex multi operator environment. It will be in GOP's, the private
operators' and the public's best interest to maintain strong regulatory institutions to ensure adequate
interconnection and revenue sharing arrangements between operators and protection of consumer interests.
13.        Actions Agreed. A sector policy letter and implementation plan from GOP, including PTC's
privatization, and the appointment of key staff for PTA and FAB, were conditions of negotiations. During
negotiations, agreements were reached regarding: (a) organizational structure and staffing of PTA and
FAB and their funding arrangements; (b) establishment of a project unit and appointment of a project
manager for project implementation; (c) establishment of a special Tender Board under the supervision of



-4-
MOC for PTA's and FAB's procurement; (d) annual audit reports for the project, special account and PTA
and FAB; (e) performance indicators for PTA and FAB; (f) progress reports and project accounts for PTA
and FAB and; (g) studies to support the sector reform program. As a condition of Loan Effectiveness,
MOC will obtain approval of the project and its main components by ECNEC. Any change in or lapse of
the Telecommunications Ordinance/Act that would materially and adversely affect the carrying out of the
project could trigger remedial measures by the Bank.
14.        Environmental Aspects. No environmental assessment is required, as the proposed project
would have no adverse impact on the environment. The project has been given a "C" environmental rating.
15.        Program Objective Categories.  The principal objective categories of the project are (a)
Privatization: The project would support the privatization of PTC and encourage private investments in the
sector; (b) Telecommunications Sector Regulation: The project would assist in the creation of PTA for the
regulation of the telecommunications sector and FAB for the management of the radio frequency spectrum;
and (c) Liberalization and Competition: Improved sector regulation would promote further liberalization
and competition in the provision of telecommunication equipment and services.
16.          Project Benefits. The project is an attractive investment in basic economic management,
leading to a more efficient telecommunications sector. Telecommunications services are increasingly based
on radio technologies and it is being realized that the radio frequency spectrum is a valuable resource that
should be protected. In Pakistan, as in most other countries, the licenses for existing mobile cellular and
other radio based services were granted without auctions or high up-front charges. For the future, the
project will provide GOP with the licensing and monitoring tools to mobilize resources and protect against
unlicensed use of the frequency spectrum, which, judging from intemational experience, has a substantial
value. The establishment of a transparent regulatory framework and competent regulators with adequate
authority and known mandate are essential for the reform of the sector and GOP's privatization efforts.
Private operators of telecommunications services would benefit from knowing the rules for tariff
adjustments, interconnection, fair competition, licensing, etc., and this would encourage them to invest and
expand services. The consumers would benefit from increased choice and competition in the provision of
services, the establishment of quality of service standards, the consumer protection aspects of new
legislation and the possibility to take their complaints to the regulator, PTA, in case an operator does not
take adequate corrective action. Improved and expanded telecommunications services will contribute to
economic growth and poverty alleviation.
17.    Risks. There are specific project risks related to the timing of PTC's privatization. An early
privatization of PTC would complicate the transfer of relevant staff, equipment, sites and buildings from
PTC to PTA and FAB, renegotiations of interconnection and revenue sharing arrangements between PTCL
and other operators, and reform of GOP's taxation policy towards the sector. The transfer of relevant staff,
equipment, sites and buildings from PTC to PTA/FAB has been initiated and should be completed well in
time before PTC is privatized. GOP's maintenance of capable regulators and adequate funding
arrangements for PTA and FAB are critical to ensure efficient regulation of the sector and the longer term
benefits of the project. There is a risk that PTA/FAB staff is appointed on political grounds rather than
merit. However, this risk is mitigated by the Telecommunications Ordinance, which provides PTA with
substantial financial and administrative autonomy. During negotiations, GOP agreed to make available in a
timely fashion all the necessary funds for the efficient operations of PTA and FAB. Similarly, GOP will
finalize the staffing arrangements and the organizational structure of PTA and FAB by early 1996 to make
them fully operational. After initial delays, GOP is now progressing satisfactorily in these matters. The
above risks are managable.
