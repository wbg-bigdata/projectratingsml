PANAMA
INSTITUTO DE RECURSOS HIDRAULICOS Y ELECTRIFICACION - IRHE
SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
1. THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
1.01      The main source of indigenous commercial energy identified so far
in Panama is hydro energy. The Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y
Electrificacion (IRHE), with the assistance of foreign consultants and the
financing of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Swedish
Government, has prepared pre-feasibility and feasibility studies for 13
projects with a potential of 1,880 MW and an average generation of 10,800 GWh
per year (see Annex 1.5).  Other studies also prepared by IRE at inventory
level with local surveys for each river based on gross linear potential or
surface runoff potential, show additional hydro energy resources on the order
of 4,700 MW and 27,000 GWh per year. Some of the larger projects such as the
ones of the Changuinola, Teribe, Veraguas and Tabasara bassins are located in
the west of Panama, remote from the energy consumption centers, and require
large investments in transmission facilities. For this reason, and in order
to facilitate a staggered power development more in line with its fiuancial
possibilities, IRHE has decided to carry out feasibility studies for medium
size hydroelectric projects (para. 4.09), located closer to the main consump-
tion centers, before deciding on which project to develop next, and has post-
poned the execution of final design of the Changuinola project (300 NW),
originally planned to be financed by the Inter-American Development Bank
(TDB).
1.02      Panama's geothermal resources would permit the installation of
about 400 MW according to the results of preliminary investigations prepared
by Corporacion Miners de Cerro Colorado (CODEMIN), a government-owned mining
company, and by IRHEE, from 1971 to present, with UNDP and the Organizacion
Latinoamericana de Energia (OLADE) financing. The geothermal sites are
located in the areas of Anton, Calobre, Colorado and the Baru Volcano. Under
a project financed by IDB, and with the participation of OLADE as executing
agency, IRRE has contracted consultants to execute a geothermal potential
survey across the country, and the pre-feasibility study of the Baru and
Cerro Colorado sites, where power plants of around 110 MW could be installed;
the studies would be completed in 1987.
1.03      Investigations to determine the existence of petroleum deposits and
coal resources have not advanced; preliminary information available at the
moment shows no indication of existence of such resources.
1.04      With USAID financing, IRHE has prepared feasibility studies for 40
mini-hydro plants with capacities of 5 kW to 1,000 kW, and has installed four



-4-
plants of this kind (total 600 kW). IRHE's experience is that mini-hydros
are not attractive in Panama because of their relatively high investment
cost; however, sometimes they are the only feasible alternative to supply
electricity to small isolated communities.  IRHE is also conducting studies
and experiments to utilize other renewable sources of energy such as biomass,
biogas, solar energy and firewood, although these sources are not expected to
contribute significantly to the country's energy supply in the foreseeable
future.
Energy Demand and Supply
1.05      Panama continues to depend heavily on imported petroleum to meet
its energy requirements. In 1982, 11.75 million barrels of petroleum were
imported at a cost of US$373.4 million, or about 20% of all Panama's imports
that year. In 1983 about 13.5 million barrels of petroleum were imported,
accounting for 72Z of Panama's total primary energy supply, up from 60% in
1981; this increase was caused mainly by the additional electric energy
generated by oil-fired thermal power plants, required to meet energy demand
growth and to compensate for the decreased output of hydroelectric power
plants during the drought of 1982 and 1983. This dependence has been reduced
significantly since the start in 1984 of operation of the Fortuna (Edwin
Fabrega) Hydroelectric Plant, the capacity of which would be augmented by the
proposed project. Petroleum is refined locally at Las Minas refinery which
has a capacity of 100,000 bbl per day. Currently, about half of the imported
petroleum is re-exported, mainly as diesel and fuel oil.
1.06      The following table shows the gross energy consumption by sources
for the period 1979-1983:

at 1.0 Tcal - 1.163 GWh
Energy Planning
1.07      Comision Nacional de Energia (CONADE), created in 1980 as an
advising body to the President of the Republic, is in charge of investigating
anrd planning all matters related to energy supply and consumption in Panama.
It is headed by IRHE's Director General and operates with personnel of IRHE's



-5-
Planning Directorate. CONADE's Executive Board is chaired by the Minister of
Planning and Economic Policy and includes its Director, its Technical Secre-
tary and delegates representing the President of the Republic, the Minister
of Commerce and Industry and the Association of Panamanian Engineers. Under
Loan 1954-PAN, CONADE, with the assistance of consultants, is finalizing an
Energy Development National Plan which covers (a) planning and organization
of the energy sector; (b) energy auditing and conservation; (c) cost analysis
of energy conservation and substitution; and (d) establishment of a national
energy information center.
Bank Participation in the Power Sector
1.08      Since 1962 the Bank has made six loans to IRHE totalling US$204.4
million (Annex 1.1). The first four loans have helped to finance hydro-
electric and thermal expansion (533 MW) and associated transmission, and the
fifth and sixth loans finance subtransmission and distribution projects
across the country. Bank participation has contributed to the improvement of
sector organization and planning and has facilitated the inflow of foreign
commercial and bilateral financing to the sector. Bank lending has assisted
IRHE and the Government in their efforts to implement tariff policies aimed
at maintaining electricity prices in line with long-run marginal costs and at
providing appropriate generation of funds to meet the sector investment
requirements. The continued Bank presence in the sector would be crucial to
(i) help finance IRHE's expansion program, which is an essential element of
the Government development strategy of reducing dependence on imported oil,
through direct loans and by assisting IRRE in arranging the necessary
co-financing from commercial and/or official sources; (ii) ensure that the
development of this program is based on sound economic criteria and well
integrated into the country's overall energy policy; (iii)continue to
strengthen IRRE institutionally and financially; and (iv) ensure that the
level and structure of IRHE's tariffs remain in line with economic costs and
provide for an adequate level of self-financing.
1.09      As detailed in the corresponding Project Completion and tudit
reports, the first three Power Projects financed under Loans 322-PAN (1962),
661-PAN (1970) and 948-PAN (1973) were successfully completed although with
some delays and cost overruns. In the execution of the Fourth Power Project,
partly financed under Loan 1470-PAN, the construction of the Fortuna Hydro-
electric Plant encountered unexpected poor geological conditions which
resulted in a delay of 16 months and a cost overrun of 93% 1/, which the
Bank and IDB helped to finance, through supplemental loans. The Fifth Power
Project was completed as scheduled, although with a cost overrun of about 50%
due to the expansion of the scope of the project and higher than estimated
local costs, and the execution of the Sixth Power Project is advancing
satisfactorily.
1.10      The proposed US$51.0 million loan would be the seventh to IRHE, and
would help to finance the construction of the second stage of the Fortuna
1/ As compared to the original cost estimate and original scope of work.
The Fortuna Project started commercial operation in 1984.



(Edwin Fabrega) Project, raising of the dam, to increase its generating
capacity, the execution of feasibility studies of new hydroelectric projects
for future construction and an asset evaluation study.
Power Sector Organization and Regulation
1.11      IRHE, an autonomous Government agency created in 1961, is the sole
entity responsible for public service electricity supply in Panama, except
for the supply of the Canal and adjacent areas (para. 1.13). IRHE acquired
the Compania Panamena de Fuerza y Luz (FyL) in 1972, the Empresas Electricas
de Chiriqui in 1973, the Hidroelectrica de El Valle in 1976, and two small
power utilities in 1978: La Chorrera, formerly a privately owned company in
West Panama Province (about 3 MW), and Bocas del Toro, a municipal company
(less than 1 NW).
1.12      IRHE's Board of Directors is in charge of power sector policies
(para. 2.02). There is no separate regulatory body for the sector.
Electricity tariffs have to be approved by the Cabinet on the recommendation
of IRHE's Board and the Economic Cabinet 2/. IRHE's annual budget is
subject to approval by the Economic Cabinet.
1.13      Electric service to the Canal facilities and adjacent areas is
provided by the Panama Canal Commission which has an installed capacity of
210 MW (Annex 1.4).  The systems of the Canal Commission and IRHE are
interconnected and exchange of power and energy is determined for economic
dispatch and technical reasons on a day-to-day basis and is efficiently
carried out, although there Is no formal power exchange contract. In 1983
IRHE purchased 23 GWh from the Commission. Most of the residential service
to the Ancon and Cristobal areas inside the former Canal Zone is now provided
by IRHE at standard tariffs.
1.14      IRHE and the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), signed
early in 1982 a system interconnection agreement setting forth the basis for
energy exchange and pricing, and for the progrAmming and financing of the
related facilities. The interconnection is financed by the Bank (Loan 1778-
PAN) and by IDB and would benefit both countries, permitting the exchange of
up to 150 MW in emergency and secondary hydroelectric energy to replace
thermal generation in Panama. The completion of this project, originally
scheduled for 1984, has now a delay of one year due to difficulties of both
institutions in securing the complementary financing required for the pur-
chase of equipment.
2/  The 'Gabinete Economico  created by executive Decree of November 25, 1983
is chaired by the Minister of the Presidency of the Republic, and
includes the Minister of Planning and Economic Policy, the Minister of
Finance and Treasury, the Minister of Commerce atad Industry, the
Controller General of the Republic, the General Manager of the National
Bank of Panama and the General Manager of the "Caja de Ahorros
(Government's savings bank).

Power Tariffs
1.15      Government legislation enacted in 1958 allows IRHE to earn an
annual rate of return of 8.75% on a rate base equal to average net revalued
assets in operation plus a working capital allowance of three months
revenues. A covenant under Loan 2313-PAN establishes that IRHE's tariffs
will be set to allow 8.75% as a rate of return, starting in 1980. Actual
figures were 8Z in 1980, 9.2% in 1981, 7.4% in 1982 and 5.2Z in 1983; the
reasons for the shortfall in 1982 and 1983 are given in para. 5.02. Fixed
assets, including major works under construction, will continue to be revalu-
ed yearly in accordance with a method satisfactory to the Bank 3/ (para.
2.09).
1.16      IRHE's tariff structure is based on the principle of marginal cost-
ing, and reflects the cost of the investments on incremental supply facili-
ties and the incremental cost of operation and maintenance required to pro-
vide incremental energy. They were designed by IRHE with the assistance of
the consultant, SOFRELEC of France, under provisions of Loan 1470-PAN, and
include fuel surcharge. In 1984 the average tariff was 11.14¢/kWh, plus a
fuel surcharge of 1.67d/kWh. The substitution of thermal generation by
hydroelectricity, now in progress with the start of generation from the
Fortuna Project (Stage I), has substantially reduced the fuel surcharge.
From 1985 on, tariff (including fuel surcharge) has been projected to grow at
7.2% average (current terms) per year until 1989. The tariffs would remain
about equal to the long-run marginal cost estimated by IRHE (para. 6.02),
calculated for an expansion program that considers the postponement of the
Changuinola project (para. 4.03). Their application would permit IRHE to
generate enough cash to cover its debt service, and to finance 66% of the new
investments in the period 1984-89 (para. 5.08).
1.17      IRHE applies a unified tariff structure to all its customers
throughout the country (Annex 1.2). It has been designed to discourage
excessive electricity use by residential consumers with higher consumption,
as shown in Annex 1.3 wlhich also contains information on the distribution of
electricity consumption in Panama for the month of December 1984. The
existing covenants under Loan 2313-PAN linking IRHE's tariffs to long-run
marginal cost have been maintained under the proposed loan (para. 7.02).
Existing Facilities
1.18      IRHE's total installed capacity by December 1984 was 824 MW of
which 67X was lhydroelectric capacity. The following table summarizes the
existing capacity and 1984 generation in Panama by type of installation and
ownership (see Annexes 1.4 and 3.2 for details):
3/ The methodology agreed with the Bank provides for revaluation of assets
(including major works during construction) according to specified
indices for international inflation (Handy-Whitman indices) and local
inflation (composite index of IRHE's labor and materials costs).

1.19      By the end of 1984 the transmission system consisted of about 850
km of 220 kV and 115 kV lines interconnecting the regional systems and the
main power plants to the grid.  The same year distribution systems totalled
about 5,200 km of 34.5 kV and lower voltage lines. Total capacity in trans-
formers was about 1,200 MVA at 220 kV and 115 kV, and 1,010 MVA at 34.5 kV
and lower voltages.
Electricity Consumption and Access to Service
1.20      Per capita coasumption of electricity in Panama was 687 kWh in
1977, 753 kWh in 1979, 801 kWh in 1981 and 940 kWh in 1984 41.  In 1984, 81%
of the urban population and 42% of the rural population, or 59% of the total
population, had access to electricity. IRHE's goal is to increase those
figures to 85%, 45% and 62% respectively by 1986. This reflects the Govern-
ment's awareness of the need to provide adequate public services to support
the service oriented economy of the country.
Rural Electrification
1.21      IRHE has started the execution of a five year rural electrification
program, the first stage of which would be completed by 1987 at an estimated
cost of US$26.0 million, of which IDB is financing US$16.8 million. This
stage covers 1,400 km of 34.5 kV lines and would serve 13,500 new rural
consumers.
4/ Per capita electricity consumption and access to electricity in 1981 for
some South American countries are respectively: Argentina 1,444 kWh and
80%; Brazil 1,167 kWh and 57%; Colombia 872 kWh and 63%; Ecuador 438 kWh
and 43%; Peru 619 kWh and 40% and Uruguay 1,205 kWh and 91% (Source:
IBRD, Power Sector Data Sheets for 1981).



-9-
Power Sector Development and Constraints
1.22      The main objectives of IRHE's expansion program are:
(a) to meet electricity demand at least cost;
(b)  to integrate the small isolated systems into the regional systems;
(c) to interconnect the regional systems through a high-voltage
national grid; and
(d) to develop the country's hydro and geothermal resources to meet the
increase in demand and to substitute high cost thermal generation.
1.23      IRHE's technical staff has acquired considerable experience in the
design, construction and supervision of power projects, some of which, lfke
the Fortuna hydro project, have presented difficult technical and financial
problems. Such experience has been complemented with formal training in and
outside the country and on the job training provided by consultants. As a
result IRRE's staff is technically prepared to meet most of the future
project requirements. However, consultants' services will still be required
for the design of large power plants, complex transmission systems and
substations and other highly specialized technical projects. The Bank's
presence in the power sector has contributed to the encouragement and support
of IRHE's staff training in particular and institution building in general.
1.24      IRHE has successfully overcome the short-term financial constraints
related to the cost overrun of the Fortuna project (para. 1.09). No major
financial constraints are anticipated at present, provided that IRHE
continues to charge adequate tariffs for electric service and meet the rates
of return discussed in para. 5.11.

2. THE BORROWER
Background
2.01      The proposed borrower, IRHE, is an autonomous agency of the
Panamanian Government, created in 1961 for the purpose of planning,
constructing and operating, under exclusive basis, all power generation
required by the country. Since IRHE's creation, the Government has purchased
the assets of other private utilities vesting them in IRHE. Today the
institution is the sole utility providing electrical energy to the entire
country, with the exception of the area served by the Panama Canal Commission
(para. 1.13).
Organization and Administration
2.02      IRHE is reputed to have the best organization and staff among
public institutions in Panama. IRHE is directed by a seven member Board
of Directors and a Director General. The Chairman is the Minister of
Planning and Economic Policy; other members are the Ministers of Agriculture
and of Commerce and Industry, and the representatives of the Association of
Industrialists, of the Banking Association, of the Society of Engineers and
Architects, and of IRHE's Labor Union. This Board composition has generally
proven to be satisfactory. IRHE's annual operating and investment budget
must be approved by the Government's Economic Cabinet (para. 1.12)-
2.03      Administration is entrusted to the Director General, the Deputy
Director General and the General Executive Director. The first two are
appointed by the President of the Republic, and the General Executive
Director by the Director General-
2.04      IRHE's current organization (Annex 2.1) was modified in 1983 to
include five Directorates (Administration, Finances and Computer Services,
Planning, Operations, and Engineering and Construction). The basic
organization was implemented in 1978 as a result of an organizational and
training program executed by IRHE with the assistance of the consultant
Gilbert and Associates (USA), with Bank financing (Loan 1470-PAN). The
modification introduced in 1983 is adequate for today's operation.
2.05      Bank financed organizational studies, training and consultant's
services, especially under the Fourth and Fifth Power Projects, have
permitted IRRE to achieve important institutional improvements such as:
organizational structure, staff training at all levels, implementation of
computer fac'l1ttes for billing, accounting, technical applications and
financial projections; implementation of financial and load forecasting
models; purchasing procedures and management of wiarehouses; and coverage of
risk insurance policies.
Staff
2.06      IRHE's relatively favorable compensation policies combined with a
plentiful supply of manpower in Panama has enabled IRHE to hire and retain



- 11 -
personnel in the numbers required. Total staff in December 1984 was 5,610,
71% of whom administer and operate the power system across the country; the
remaining are involved in engineering and construction of new projects and in
general support. Of all staff, 19% are classified as managers and supervis-
ors, 34% as administrative workers, and 47% as technical workers. The
educational background of the staff is relatively good (60% have completed
secondary education and about 400 have a university degree, 275 of whom are
engineers).  With substantial support under a number of Bank-assisted pro-
jects, IRHE has developed its own staff training programs both in-house and
overseas so that IRHE now has a good core of qualified managers and profes-
sionals at the higher levels, as well as trained skilled workers at the lower
levels.
2.07      The rapid expaasion of IRHE's operations to cover the entire
country caused a fast growth of its staff, leading to a high incidence of
personnel costs in power rates and productivity indicators lower than the
average for similar utilities 5/. Under Loan 2313-PAN, IRHE agreed to limit
staff growth to conform to estiblished indicator levels, and management later
decided to (a) freeze hiring and fill necessary positions through internal
transfers; and (b) decrease IRHE's construction force by not replacing con-
struction workers leaving the company. In addition, IRKE's management also
decided to update and refine IRHE's personnel policies and procedures, aiming
at improving the company's efficiency, with an emphasis given to middle-level
management performance and overall training needs.
Training
2.08      IRE's training programs (para. 2.06) are generally of good quality
but require periodic review to meet evolving training needs in view of IRHE's
rapid growth. The elements of a training policy exist, but a coherent policy
and a systematic approach consistently applied to all staff are needed.
Training activities are spread over five different departments, requiring
efficient coordination. IRHE's overall efficiency could be substantially and
economically improved through training, requiring, at this stage, more of an
internal institutional reappraisal (for which IRHE will need some assistance)
than immediate investment in training facilities. For this purpose, IRHE,
with the assistance of consultants financed with funds from the Sixth Power
Project, is analyzing the required reforms of its personnel and training
policies and organization, and planning the expansion of training activities
for the next three years.
Accounting and Rate Base
2.09      IRHE has substantially improved its accounting procedures in the
last few years. As a result, monthly financial statements are now issued
within 30 days of their respective closing dates. IRlE's fixed assets have
been revalued yearly since 1976 by a suitably qualified local independent
51 In 1984, one of the productivity indicators, the number of customers
served per employee, vas 48 in Panama, as compared to 75 and 95 for the
power sectors of Costa Rica and Ecuador respectively.

consultant under a methodology agreed with the Bank (para. 1.15). However,
in view of the lapsed time and in view of the necessity of having a correct
valuation of net fixed assets in operation based on replacement costs as an
adequate rate base, during negotiations IRHE agreed to designate adequately
qualified staff within its organization to study the current (replacement
cost) value of its assets in operation (para. 7.01(a)); if during implementa-
tion technical assistance is needed to set up such a group, an amount up to
US$100,000 for foreign exchange components would be made available from the
proceeds of the proposed loan within the category assigned to consultants.
Once such group carries out the first comprehensive study on the current
value of the fixed assets in operation, views will be exchanged with the Bank
on the advisability of revising its assets valuation and its assets revalua-
tion methodology.
Auditing
2.10      Since IRHE is a Government autonomous agency, its accounts are
audited annually by the office of the Controller General of the Republic.
IRHE's annual external audit, required under previous Bank loans, has been
performed satisfactorily by Arthur Anderson and Co. since 1975. Under the
terms of the proposed loan, IRHE will continue to engage qualified external
auditors to audit its accounts yearly and to send to the Bank audited finan-
cial statements, including the Auditor's recommendations, within four months
of the end of each fiscal year.
Billing and Collection
2.11      Within the context of the Fourth Power Project (Loan 1470-PAN),
IRHE, with the assistance of Gilbert and Associates (USA), established a
modern data processing system for customer billing and accounting. Monthly
bills are distributed by carriers and by mail, and within 20 days of receipt
consumers should pay their bills at IRHE's offices or banks located through-
out the country.
Accounts Receivable
2.12      Electricity bills are paid regularly by private consumers and by
the Central Government and most decentralized agencies. However,
Municipalities and autonomous public agencies have been paying only after
long delays, and the Central Government has not been able to retain funds for
direct payment to IRME because these agencies are beyond its budgetary and/or
legal control. By the end of 1984, the accounts receivable from the public
sector amounted to:

a/  Non-revenue earning agencies.
b/ Revenue earning agencies, although some of them receive budgetary
allocations.
With the intervention of the Central Government, however, the payment of
arrears by the public sector was resolved satisfactorily in January 1985, as
(a) the autonomous agencies reached agreement with IRHE for settlement of
US$8 million of these arrears, payment of the remaining US$3 million over two
years, with the Government assuming any remaining balance at the end of the
two years, and timely payment of current bills; (b) the Central Government
assumed the payment in five years of the entire arrears from the Municipali-
ties; and (c) to minimize further problems with payments from the Municipali-
ties, starting in January 1985, the total cost of electricity for street
lighting will be included in the tariff for the remaining consumers.
Performance Indicators and Reporting
2.1.3     During negotiations, IRHE agreed to comply with and to inform the
Bank quarterly on the performance indicators showa in Annex 2.2 which define
targets for continuing to improve its operating efficiency. IRHE also agreed
to inform the Bank whenever noncompliances with such targets are expected to
occur, and to prepare and send to the Bank periodic progress reports and such
other reports as the Bank may reasonably request, including a project comple-
tion report.
Insurance
2.14      IRHE carries acceptable insurance against risks arising from civil
liability, motor vehicle claims, fire, lightning, explosion, flood, accident
claims, and income loss due to equipment failure for specified plants, ware-
houses and buildings. As a result of a rationalization of its practices,
IRHE now contracts its insurance policies with three companies through a
broker.

3. THE MARKET
Historical Market
3.01      TRHE's service area extends throughout the country and includes
rural areas and isolated villages. As provided in the Torrijos-Carter Canal
Treaty signed in 1977, IRHE is gradually assuming the service to residential
customers of the former Canal Zone. However, electricity supply for the
Canal operations and its military installations will continue to be provided
by the Canal Commission. At present, IRHE serves 59% of Panama's population,
equivalent to 1.2 million inhabitants. In the period 1970-80, in the areas
now served by IRHE, electricity consumption grew at an annual average of 8.8%
which declined to a slower pace in the period 1977-84 (i.e. 6.4% in 1977-84
and 5.5% in 1980-84) as a result of generation restrictions in 1977 and 1978,
a public campaign since 1979 directed by the Government to save electric
energy and lately the economic recession.
Energy Losses
3.02      Energy losses at IRHE's system have grown from 12% (referred to
gross generation) in 1978 to a peak of 17% in 1982 because of distribution
system overload and theft of electricity, which IRHE is addressing through
the renovation and enlarging of the distribution network, with the Bank's
financial assistance (Loans 1778-PAN and 2313-PAN). In 1983, when a number
of renewed facilities were placed in operation in the central and western
provinces, system losses were reduced to 15.3%, but increased again to 17.7%
in 1984, in part because of the increase of transmission losses caused by the
connection to the system of the Fortuna Project, located at a relatively long
distance (about 400 km) from Panama City, the main consumption center. As
suggested in a study prepared under the Joint UNDP/World Bank Energy Sector
Management Program 6/, the construction of a new transmission system would
be economically justified by the reduction of energy losses. However, IRHE
is not planning to implement it at present because of current financial con-
straints faced by IRHE itself and by the country. Other recommendations
presented in the study, like the installation of capacitors and the improve-
ment of auxiliary installations in the Bahia-Las Minas power plant are being
carried out by IRHE. Within the context of the Sixth Power Project, IRHE,
with the assistance of consultants, is performing a system loss reduction
study which would help to achieve further reductions through transformer load
management, reactive power compensation, feeder design optimization, monitor-
ing and control of energy theft, etc. As part of the study, IRHE is install-
ing feeder and substation recording instruments to be used as input for
computerized optimization system programs, also financed by the Bank, under
the Fifth Power Project.

The Forecast
3.03      IRHE has improved its load forecast models with the assistance of
consultants financed by the Bank. The most suited model for Panama's
conditions is one that considers both econometric and macroeconomic inputs
related to historical and projected data for consumption and economic growth.
Energy sales for the period 1983-90 are expected to grow at an average rate
of 6.0% per annum, a rate lower than the 6.75% forecast for the same period
during the appraisal of the Sixth Power Project (Loan 2313-PAN). The
forecast considers the relatively low growth of sales in recent years, and
the inclusion of new bulk sales expected during the period to Petroterminales
and Chiriquiland Company, at present large customers of IRHE who decided to
purchase the balance of their electricity needs from IRHE's system rather
than to continue with their own power generation. Statistical data and
forecast of energy sales in Panama by consumption categories are shown in
detail in Annex 3.1 and summarized in the following table, which shows the
changes in patterns of electricity consumption expected in the future.

Port Authority, International Airport, Water Treatment Plants, etc.
b/ Includes bulk sales and IRHE's own consumption.
3.04      The number of IRHE's consumers grew from 210,000 in 1978 to 269,000
in 1984, and IRHE expects to serve 307,000 consumers in 1988.
The Energy and Capacity Balances
3.05      The forecast energy and capacity balances are shown in Annexes 3.2
and 3.3, and graphically in Annexes 3.4 and 3.5. The generation dispatch of
IRHE's powver plants (Annex 3.2) shows that thermal generation from existing
plants will be greatly reduced after the inclusion in the system of the
Fortuna Project. Generation dispatch was forecast by IRHE using a mathemat-
cal load dispatch model, on a month by month basis; the model takes into
consideration the probability of occurrence of dry, average and wet hydrolog-
ical conditions.

4. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
IREE's Development Program
4.01      Up to 1976 Panama relied almost exclusively on thermal generation
to supply electric energy, thus depending heavily on fuel imports. As a
consequence of the oil crisis of the seventies, the Government and IRHE
embarked on an ambitious program of construction of hydroelectric projects;
after commissioning of the 150 MW Bayano power plant in 1976 and the 90 MW La
Estrella-Los Valles power plants in 1979, IRHE considerably reduced its
thermal generation from 94% in 1975 to 48% in 1982 7/, and will be reduced
to 3% in 1985 when the first stage of the Fortuna Project will be fully
operational.
4.02      IRHE's generation expansion program for the country aims towards
three important goals: (i) the installation of least cost capacity to supply
demand growth; (ii) the substitution of hydro for thermal generation; and
(iii) the improvement of system reliability to secure a loss of load prob-
ability of two days per year as a maximum. The generation expansion program
is based on a Master Plan prepared in 1976 by IRRE with the assistance of
consultants, periodically updated by IRHE's Planning Directorate.  In its
1984 version, which covers the period 1984-2003, the system expansion study
compared a total of eight alternative plans, combining in various
arrangements and timing the following projects:
(a) Fortuna II, raising of the dam in 1987, 1988 or 1989
(b) Bayano unit No. 3 hydro (75 MW)
(c) Changuinola I hydro project (300 MW)
(d) Teribe I hydroelectric project (237 MW)
(e) Esti-Barrigon hydro plants (120 MW)
(f) Baru geothermal plant (110 MW)
(g)  Colon coal fired steam power plant (150 NW)
(h) Colon oil fired steam power plant (75 MW)
(i) Gas turbine power plant (50 MW)
(j) New transmission grid at 230 kV or 500 kV
4.03      As a result of economic comparisons made for the various alterna-
tive expansion schemes, IREE adopted a firm expansion program which covers
the period 1984-1990, a tentative construction program for the period 1991-92
7/ In 1983, an exceptionally dry year, IRHE's thermal generation increased
to 61% of its total generation.

and a reference construction program for the period 1993-2003. The firm
construction program, which includes the raising of the Fortuna dam, is
essentially the same program agreed with the Bank under the Loan Agreement
for the Sixth Power Project (Credit 2313-PAN). However, there are some
substantial changes in IRHE's expansion plan after 1991. In view of the
difficulties that the Government and IRHE would face in financing large
projects, IRHE decided to postpone the execution of the Changuinola project
and replace it with smaller power plants, easier to finance; the resulting
tentative construction program, however, would be confirmed only in 1986
when the results of additional feasibility studies on medium size
hydroelectric projects and the size and cost of geothermal resources are
known (para. 4.09). TRHE's expansion program is the following:
Project                              Capacity MW   For operation in
(a) Firm construction program:
Interconnection with Costa Rica
at 220 kV                                -        December 1985
Fortuna II: raising of the dam              -       December 1988
Bayano hydro, unit No. 3                  75        January 1990
(b)  Tentative construction program:
Esti-Barrigon hydroelectric plants        120               1990
David-Panama 500 kV transmission
line (operated at 230 kV)                 -               1991
(c) Reference construction program:
Colon coal fired steam plant              150               1993
Changuinola I hydro project               300               1996
David-Panama transmission line,
upgrading to 500 kV                       -               1996
Teribe I hydroelectric project            237               2000
Tabasara hydroelectric project            220               2002
4.04      In addition, the program includes the expansion and improvement of
the subtransmission and distribution systems, and the execution of the first
stage of the rural electrification program, financed by IDB, covering 1,400
km of primary voltage transmission lines (34.5 kV) to serve 12,500 new rural
consumers. Section 4.05 of the Loan Agreement for Credit 2313-PAN, dealing
with IRHE's expansion program has been updated and included in the Loan
Agreement for the proposed project (para. 7.02).
4.05      The cost of the 1984-1989 slice of the above construction program
(6 years) in current prices, excluding interest during construction, is
estimated at US$725.0 million, of which 42% would be local costs and 58%
foreign costs (para. 5.07 and Annex 4.1). It includes the full investment of
IRHE's firm construction program, and the initial investments required for
the tentative construction program. This investment program has been used
for the financial forecast of the period (para. 5.07).

Project Origin, Preparation and Justification
4.06      Technical and economic studies made in 1976 for the Fortuna
hydroelectric project by IRHE with the assistance of the consultant C. T.
Main (USA), recommended that the rock-fill dam for the project be built in
two stages: Stage I, a 60 a high dam, with an operating level of 1,010 m
above sea level, forming a reservoir with a useful storage capacity of 8.4
MCM, and Stage II, raising the dam by 40 m to operating level 1,050 m,
enlarging the storage capacity to 158.4 MCM. Stage I, financed by the Bank
under Loan 1470-PAN (Fourth Power Project) was completed in February 1983,
and now IRHE is planning the execution of Stage II for completion by the end
of 1988. A project updating study prepared by IRHE in March 1984, presents a
detailed technical and economic analysis, justifying the execution of Stage
II. The generation attributed to the Fortuna hydroelectric project,
calculated for combined operation with the storage provided by IRHE's Bayano
hydroelectric project, is the following:
Total Generation in GWh per Year
Fortuna I         Fortuna I and II
Firm Energy (dry year condition)                  846                 1,390
Average Energy (average hydrology)              1,242                 1,489
4.07      Safety of the lower dam under maximum flood conditions demands
raising its height as soon as possible, as the reservoir-spillway for Stage I
has been designed for a flood of 2,325 CMS only (probabiliy of occurance: 1
in 55 years), a calculated risk which wiLl disappear when the spillway for
Stage II is constructed, providing a reservoir-spillway capacity for the
maximum probable flood of 5,300 CMS, which is considered a safe design in
accordance with international engineering practice. As an alternative, IRHE
could increase the safety of the lower dam by enlarging the capacity of the
spillway to acceptable limits, with an investment estimated at 10 million US
Dollars, an unattractive proposition not being considered by IRHE, as this
investment would not bring any return in terms of additional energy
generation.
4.08      The execution of the Fortuna II project is a part of the least
cost solution to supply electric energy to Panama, and is included in IRHE's
firm construction program. In order to further justify the execution of the
project and optimize its year of operation, IRHE made a detailed economic
analysis for the supply of electric energy in the period 1987-1991, prior to
the operation of other projects. The following alternatives were considered:
(a) operation of Fortuna II in 1987; (b) operation of Fortuna II in 1988j (c)
operation of Fortuna II in 1989; (d) operation of an equivalent 75 MW oil
fired steam power plant in 1989. The existing Bahia-Las Minas thermal power
plant would provide the energy balance for all the alternatives considered.
The alternative plans were compared assuming that international oil prices
prevailing in 1983 (crude oil at US$29 per barrel f.o.b.) would remain con-
stant during the period of analysis in real terms (17 years). A discount



19 -
rate of 12% was used to determine the present value of the capital
investments and operating costs related to each alternative. Sensitivity
analyses were made for fuel prices (prices 15% lower and 10% higher) and for
discount rates of 10% and 14%. The results of the analyses show that the
most costly alternative would be to install an equivalent 75 MW thermal
plant, and that the least cost would be to operate the Stage II of the
Fortuna dam at the earliest possible date, now estimated by IRHE to be
December 1988. Details of the economic analysis are shown in Annex 4.5, and
the study is available in the Project File.
Project Objectives and Description
4.09      The proposed Seventh Power Project would include the execution of
Stage II of the Fortuna hydroelectric project, raising the height of the dam
to elevation 1,050 m, which will increase the availability of hydroelectric
energy in Panama by an amount equivalent to the output of a 75 MW thermal
plant. The project is part of IRHE's least cost expansion program and would
meet projected energy demand growth uatil 1991, when a new power plant would
be required. The project would also include (i) the execution of feasibility
studies for medium size hydroelectric projects, the results of which will be
used by IRHE to make decisions on the future generation expansion program
based on the knowledge of a larger number of alternative projects, and (ii)
the asset revaluation study (para. 2.09).
4.10      The propGsed project would include the following:
(a) Raising of the rock-fill dam at the Fortuna hydroelectric project
from operating level 1,010 m above sea level to operating level
1,050 m. Preparatory works such as clearing of organic materials
to foundation level, access roads, clearing of borrow pits, conr
struction of camps, etc. were done while executing the first stage
of the dam.
(b) Execution of field investigation for ten medium size hydroelectric
projects (Phase I), pre-feasibility studies for three (Phase II)
and feasibility studies for two (Phase III), selected from a list
of approximately 28 projects located near Panama City, the main
power consumption center in the country.
(c) Execution of a study on the current value of IRHE's assets in
operation.
Project Cost and Financing
4.11      Project cost estimates for raising the Fortuna dam are based on
detailed final designs made by the IRHE with the assistance of the consult-
ant, C.T.Main (USA), in 1983, and actual cost data updated in January 1984,
available from the execution of the first stage of the Fortuna dam. Cost
estimates for the execution of feasibility studies, also prepared by IRHE,
are based on a proposed scope of services and detailed man-month estimates
(paras. 4.15 and 4.16), using rates now being paid by IRHE for similar works
plus the cost of field activities such as drilling, travel, supplies, etc.

4.14      The proposed US$51.0 million Bank loan would finance 64% (US$46.7
million) 8/ of the total cost of the dam, and 100% of the foreign costs for
all consuTting services related to the project for the supervision of the dam
construction, the execution of the feasibility studies and the asset revalua-
tion study (para. 2.09). The loan would be made with a 15-year maturity,
including a 3-year grace period, with interest at the Bank's standard vari-
able rate. For financial forecast purposes, an interest rate of 9.29% per
annum was assumed.
Project Implementation
4.15      As in previous Bank financed projects, IRHE would be responsible
for the implementation of the project. The design and bidding documents for
Fortuna II (raising of the dam) were executed by IRIE with the assistance of
the consultant, C. T. Main, who also assisted IRHE in the design and conr-
struction supervision for the entire Fortuna hydroelectric project since its
start in 1974. The designs have been reviewed and found acceptable by an
independent Board of Consultants consisting of internationally known experts
8/ Equivalent to the total estimated foreign cost of the dam construction.
However, the Bank loar. would finance the estimated foreign exchange cost
as a fixed percentage of the dam construction costs (64%), independently
of contractual local and foreign costs. (Experience has shown that in
Panama the concept of local and foreign components of a contract does not
follow a trend, in view of the equivalence and free convertibility of the
local currency (Balboa) with the US Dollar).



- 22 -
appointed by IRHE. Construction work would be done by a single civil works
contractor. In view of the experience gained by their engineers in the
supervision of Fortuna I, supervision of construction would be done by IRHE
with assistance from foreign consultants as required (approximately 24 man-
months), including periodic revievs by the same Board of Consultants mention-
ed above.
4.16      The execution of the studies for the medium size hydroelectric pro-
jects would be carried out by IRHE's Planning Directorate, by a group of 15
local engineers, assisted by a foreign consulting company to be contracted
for all three phases of the study (field investigations, pre-feasibility and
feasibility studies). The project would require 240 man-months local and 86
man-months foreign engineers and other professionals. The asset revaluation
study would be carried out mainly by LRHE's staff, assisted by about 10 man-
months of consulting services.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.17      A single civil works contract for the construction of the dam rais-
ing would be established, through international competitive bidding initiated
in 1984, in accordance with Bank guidelines.
4.18      The consulting services required for the execution of feasibility
studies of the medium size hydroelectric projects would be contracted in
accordance with Bank Group Guidelines for Hiring of Consultants. Consulting
services required for the supervision of the dam construction, including dam
safety, would be provided, at the request of TRHE, by the same professionals
who now serve on the Board of Consultants (para. 4.15) and by individual
experts to be contracted in accordance with Bank guidelines.

4.20      Disbursements from the loan account would be fully documented and
would be made for 64% of the total cost of the dam construction, including
contingencies, with a limit of US$46.7 million, and for lOOX of foreign
expenditures for consultant services related to the supervision of the dam
construction, the execution of feasibility studies and the asset revaluation
(para. 2.09), with a limit of US$4.3 million.
Disbursement Schedule
4.21      The disbursement schedule shown in Annex 4.4 is based on a detailed
construction and implementation program prepared by IRHE, which takes into
account recent experience acquired during the construction of the first stage
of the Fortuna dam. In this project, a total of 47 months elapsed from the
time of bid invitation (March 1979) to completion of works (February 1983).
The project execution schedule summarized in Annex 4.3 considers that bid
invitation process for both the civil works contract and hiring of consul-
tants started in July 1984, and that dam construction would be finalized in
December 1988 (36 months total construction time), which is reasonable when
considering that access roads, camps, auxiliary facilities, etc. were already
constructed in the first stage of the Fortuna dam. The feasibility studies
for medium size hydroelectric projects would be completed in September 1987.
It was assumed that there would be a delay of six months between the comple-
tion of the various stages of a contract and the disbursement of funds, and
that a period of twelve months would elapse between the time of completion of
a contract and its final liquidation. The disbursement schedule is similar
to typical Bank wide profiles for the hydroelectric power subsector, except
that the period of disbursement was shortened by one and a half years to five
years, to take into account the advanced status of preparation of the pro-
Ject, the relatively simple task of construction, and the construction
schedule proposed by IRHE.  Disbursements would take place between January
1986 and December 1990, and the loan closing date would be December 31, 1990
Environment
4.22      IRHE's Department of River Basins Protection, in charge of the
management of river basins of existing and future hydroelectric projects, has
performed numerous studies related to the effects of the construction of the
Fortuna project, Stages I and II, on human population and the ecologv of the
area (See list of related studies in Annex 4.6). The studies conclude that
if specific precautions are taken, the project will have little or no nega-
tive effects on the environment. The Fortuna dam has a cachment area of
15,500 ha of tropical rain forest, the reservoir will cover an area of 100 ha
in the first stage, (Fortuna I) and 1,000 ha in the second stage (Fortuna
II). In order to provide the necessary protection to the forest in the area
and keep siltation at present low levels, by Decree of 26 September, 1976,
the Government declared as national forestry reserve an area of 19,000 ha
around the dam, and restricted use area of an additional 18,000 ha, all under
the control of forestry guards and ecologists hired by IRHE.
4.23      Preliminary studies made by IRHE in 1976 estimated tha. about 120
families living in the area would have to be relocated; in the execution
of Stage I of the project, however, only 27 families were affected by the



- 24 -
construction of access roads to the project and camp facilities, but no
relocation was necessary. The execution of Stage II will not affect
anybody. In order to help the population of the area, IRHE, by itself or
with the collaboration of other government agencies, has established
community development programs aimed at improving education, living condi-
tions and agricultural production methods, through the construction of
schools, water supply and sanitary systems, roads, housing improvements,
health, agricultural and education programs, etc. In addition, IRHE has made
studies and has surveillance on the possibility of propagation of the river
blindness disease caused by the black fly; as of this date, there are no
signs that this disease exists in Panama. The area flooded by the first
stage of the reservoir has been cleared of trees to avoid the formation of
noxious gases and acidity. During normal reservoir operation, IRHE will
supervise and control any aquatic growth on the lake surface and the same
precautions will be taken by IRHE in the execution of the second stage of the
dam.
4.24      In view of all studies made and precautions taken by IRHE, it is
reasonable to state that the construction of the dam, and in general, of the
Fortuna project, will have no negative impact on human life or on the
environment of the region.
Project Risks
4.25      The execution of the first stage of the Fortuna hydroelectric
project suffered set-backs due to initial starting delays and to unexpected
adverse geological conditiors, both in the underground powerhouse and in the
foundations of the dam. As a consequence, the project was completed in 1984,
with important cost overruns and a delay of 16 months witl. respect to the
original schedule shown in the S.AR for the Fourth Power Project (Loan 1470-
PAN). In order to solve the technical problems, IRHE performed additional
geological studies, including deep drilling, and now the geology of the
project area is well defined and no construction problems are expected during
the execution of the dam raising.   Project design and bidding documents are
completed, and IRHE has on site the faciliLies to coordinate, administer and
supervise the project, including an ergineering group composed of about 15
engineers and supporting staff. Therefore, no major project risks would be
involved and it would be reasonable to expect IRHE to complete the project
within budget and schedule.

5. FINANCES
Summary
5.01      From 1977 to 1981, IRHE sustained an improving trend in its
financial performance, and after a less prosperous 1982 and 1983 its present
financial situation is satisfactory. The difficulties which arose in late
1982 as a consequence of the cost increase of the Fortuna project were
overcome by agreements on a supplementary financing package with various
agencies including the Bank, IDB and commercial banks as well as bilateral
Government aid agreements with Italy and Venezuela. IRHE's 1984-89
investment program, including its construction program, interest during
construction, requirements for working capital and other applications,
amounts to US$965.8 million. The net internal cash generation would finance
US$640.1 million, or 66% of the total requirements, and the remaining 34%
would be covered by loans.
Past Performance and Present Position
5.02      TR E's financial performance deteriorated substantially during the
period 1974-76, mainly due to low tariff levels and insufficient Government
capital contributions. In 1977, in connection with the Fourth Power Project
(Loan 1470-PAN), IRHE and the Government agreed with the Bank on a program
for financial recovery and improvement including a covenant to obtain a rate
of return of 8.75% on revalued assets (para. 1.15). This program was recon-
firmed in 1979 and 1983 in connection with the Fifth and Sixth Power Projects
(Loans 1778 and 2313-PAN). IRHE and the Government have been in compliance
with the main undertakings of such programs; IRHE's actual rates of return
consistently increased from 6.9% in 1977 to 9.2% in 1981 due to an adequate
tariff policy, which kept pace with inflation and fuel prices. However, the
return in 1982 and 1983 fell to 7.4% and 5.2% due to two unusually dry sea-
sons which demanded higher thermal generation than forecast; the additional
fuel cost was not entirely recouped because, for Government social considera-
tions, IRHE could not apply the full fuel surcharge.
5.03      In 1982 IREE faced serious financial difficulties due to the cost
overrun of the Fortuna project (para. 1.09) in the order of US$240 million
(inicluding interest during construction); at first IRHE applied for financial
aid froa the Venezuelan-Mexican Investment Fund created in the San Jose
Agreement of April 1980, but this scheme failed when the two countries them-
selves faced financial difficulties. With the Bank's assistance, IRHE suc-
cessfully arranged another financial scheme to fund the project, which
included supplemental financing from the Bank and IDB, and new financing from
Italian cooperation agencies, commercial bai.ks and a small amount from the
Venezuelan-Mexican Investment Fund.
5.04      To partially offset the gaps resulting from the lack of long term
financing for domestic components of its investment program and to avoid
further delays in the construction schedule of the Fortuna project, in
1980-82 IRHE resorted to excessive short and medium term financing, which was
available in Panama, exceeding the limit covenanted under Bank loans.
However, IRiE has made efforts to reduce such high level of short term debt



- 26 -
(from US$58.3 million in 1981 to US$48.6 million in 1983) and has adopted a
strategy for reducing its short term debt position to a more manageable
level.
Financial Structure
5.05      As of December 31, 1983, IRHE financial structure was the following
(Annex 5.4):
US$ Million             %
Equity

Other Liabilities               63.5                5
Total         1,281.4              100
5.06      As of December 31, 1983, TRHE's principal creditor was the Bank;
the debt balance under its first five loans amounted to US$112 million (26%
of total long term debt); the second largest creditor is IDB with US$93.3
million (22%) followed by Mitsubishi, US$60 million (14%), Libra Bank, US$40
million (9%), the Government (by transfer of a loan from Dillon Read
Overseas) US$37.2 million (9%) and suppliers and commercial banks.
Investment and Financing Plan
5.07      IRHE's 1984-89 financing requirements, including its construction
program (para. 4.05 and Annex 4.1), interest during construction, require-
ments for working capital and other applications, amounts to US$965.8 million
(Annex 5.3). The construction program, excluding interest during construc-
tion, amounts to US$725.1 million or 75% of total applications, of which
US$79.1 million or 8% corresponds to the proposed Seventh Power Project. The
ongoing works comprise: conclusion of construction of the Fortuna project,
partially financed by Loan 1470-PAN, and other ongoing works such as the
Power V and VI Projects, partially financed by Loans 1778/2313-PAN and a
Rural Electrification Project partially financed by IDB. In addition to the
proposed project other future construction includes transmission, substation
and distribution facilities, and the initial investments for the Esti-
Barrigon hydro project and the Changuinola project, the operation of which
has been postponed until 1996. The interest during construction for the
period is estimated at US$115.7 million or 12% of total financing require-
ments. The increase in working capital requiremeats amounts to US$125.0
million or 13%, of which US$48.2 million represents repayment of short term
loans. The investment program and financing plan are shown in detail in
Annex 5.3 and are summarized on the next page.

5.08      Assuming the projected tariff levels are achieved, IRHE would be
able to generate a high 66% of its total financial 1984-89 requirements; the
remaining 34% would be covered by loans amounting to US$324.1 million. Of
this figure US$145.3 million would come from undisbursed proceeds of existing
loans including Loan 2313-PAN. The Power VII Project would require the
proposed loan of US$51.0 million. Finally, other future loans amounting to
US$127.8 million would be required for the rest of the 1984-89 program. IRHE
is considering the following sources: (a) US$3.4 million from suppliers; (b)
US$112.1 million from International Financing Institutions; and (c) US$12.3
million from the Venezuelan Investment Fund (already negotiated).
5.09      IRHE's proposed financing plan for 1984-89 is reasonable.  In view
of its sound financial position, the Government support and the interest
shown by lenders in projects upheld by both the Bank and IDB, it is expected
that IRHE obtain the estimated suppliers and commercial bank financing.



- 28 -
Future Finances
5.10      Financial projections 9/ presented in Annexes 5.2 to 5.4 are based
on (a) updated assumptions for inflation; (b) energy sales forecast of May
1984 and an energy balance considering the commissioning of the last unit of
the Fortuna hydroelectric power plant in October 1984; and (c) a tariff
policy decided by the Government for 1984 and 1985, and tariffs projected to
attain a rate of return of 8.75% in 1987 and thereafter, computed on a rate
base calculated using fully revalued fixed assets in operation and 1/4 of
total annual sales as a proxy of a working capital allocation.
5.11      Under these assumptions,  RLHE would obtain an average rate of
return of 8.6% for the years 1984, 1985 and 1986 (9.7% in 1984, 8.1% in 1985
and 1986). From 1987 onward the covenanted rate of 8.75% would be reached.
The level of the rate of return may need to be reviewed once the revaluation
of IRHE's fixed assets in operation is completed in 1987 (para. 2 07).
5.12      IRHE's financial situation is expected to further improve during
the forecast period (Annex 5.1). The debt service coverage on an annual
basis is not expected to fall below the 1.4 covenanted in Loan 2313-PAN; and
the debt/equity ratios (50/50 in 1983) are forecast to remain at safe levels
during the period (20/80 in 1989) despite the borrowings required for con-
struction of ongoing and future projects. The self-financing ratio shows an
increasing trend averaging 66% for the period 1984-89; the projected improve-
ment of the operating and working ratios reflect the significant change of
the operating cost structure due to the Fortuna hydropower generation. The
current ratio of 61% in 1983 decreases to 55% in 1985, but increases again
afterward, attaining a comfortable 90% in 1989.
5.13       The following package of financial covenants, which were agreed
upon by IRHE under the Fortuna and the Fifth and Sixth Power Project loans,
have been repeated in the proposed loan: (a) adequacy of accounting practices
and annual revaluation of fixed assets; (b) auditing by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank; (c) liens limitations; (d) short term debt limita-
tion; (e) long term debt and debt service coverage limitations; (f) price of
bulk sales; (g) accounts receivable targets; and (h) annual rate of return.
91 Actual financial data for 1984 were not yet available at the time of
printing this report (Februarv 1985), therefore financial projections
were not updated to reflect the results for 1984 and the new energy
sales forecast: overall results, however, are not expected to vary
significantly, nor to have unfavorable effects on the project.

6. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Least-Cost Solution
6.01      A least cost analysis prepared by IRHE for various alternative
schemes to meet the projected electric energy demand growth in Panama in the
period 1988-1991 (para. 4.08 and Annex 4.5) single out the Fortuna II Project
as the best alternative available at this time. The execution of the pro-
ject, in addition to providing the required energy to meet energy growth at
least cost, would bring other benefits which have not been evaluated in
economic terms: (1) increase of the firm energy (dry year condition) for
IRHE's entire generating system (para. 4.06), and (ii) securing the physical
safety of the existing Fortuna Dam for maximum flood conditions (para. 4.07).
Return on Investment
6.02      Since the proposed project is an integral part of TRH 's least cost
expansion program, the internal financial rate of return for the overall
investment program was calculated for a slice of time covering the period
1984-1992. An economic evaluation of the project by itself was not done as
it is difficult to allocate among the power system components the incremental
costs and benefits associated with the project. The rate of return was com-
puted as the discount rate equalizing the present value of tne stream of
costs and benefits associated with the expansion program. The cost stream,
expressed in 1984 constant prices, comprises the capital investment of the
development program and the incremental operations and maintenance costs
related to the incremental energy sales. Fuel savings due to thermal genera-
tion substitution realized with the operation of the Fortuna I Project were
not considered, as the investment for this project was done before the period
of analysis. As a proxy for benefits, the revenues derived from incremental
sales were used, assuming the same tariffs used for financial projections,
which, when expressed in constant currency, imply tariff reductions, i.e.
from USUI2.4/kWh in 1984 to USU10.1/kWh in 1989. Average long run marginal
costs for the present expansion program for the period 1983-1992 are estimat-
ed by IRHE to be USU12.1/kWh for peak loads and USi6.1/kWh for off-peak loads
(expressed in 1984 constant prices). No attempt was made to reflect further
economic benefits to society and the economy of the country, such as consumer
surplus, maintaining or improving quality of service to consumers, availabil-
ity of energy for new industries, Increasing the firm energy of IRHE's entire
hydroelectric system (para. 4.06), and increasing the security of the first
stage of the dam for the Fortuna Project (para. 4.07). The true economic
rate of return would be higher if these benefits were taken into account.
6.03      Using only tariff revenue as benefit proxy, the internal rate of
return is 19% (Annex 6.1), which compares favorably with the opportunity cost
of capital in Panama, estimated to be 12%. A sensitivity analysis was made
to estimate the impact of major uncertainties affecting the economic compari-
son for the following cases:
(a) Should the capital investment and operation and maintenance costs
be 20% higher than estimated, the rate of return would be reduced
to 15%.



- 30 -
(b) Should benefits be decreased by 2OZ because of lower energy sales
or lower tariffs, the rate or return would be decreased to 14%.
(c)  Should capital and operation and maintenance costs be 20% higher
and benefits be 20% lower, the rate of return would be decreased to
12%.

7. AGREENENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
During Negotiations
7.01      Agreements were reached that:
(a)  IRHE would study the current value (replacement cost) of its fixed
assets in operation as a complement of the annual asset revaluation
carried out by the company. Once the first comprehensive study has
been completed, views would be exchanged with the Bank on the
advisability of revising its assets valuation, its asset revalua-
tion methodology and tariffs to meet its rate of return require-
ments (para. 2.09);
(b) the remaining two thirds of the public lighting energy consumption
billed to municipalities, be included in the tariffs for the rest
of the consumers (para. 2.12);
7.02      The following main provisions of Loan Agreement 2313-PAN would be
repeated:
Ca) execution of the project;
(b) management and operation of the Borrower and revised
expansion program (paras. 4.03 and 4.04);
(e) financial covenants (paras. 1.17 and 5.13);
'd) changes in legislation affecting IRHE (para. 1.12).
7.03      Section 3.02(c) of the Guarantee Agreement limiting to no more than
60 days the outstanding electricity bills from the Government agencies and
public institutions would be repeated (para. 2.12).
Recommendation
7.04      As above assurances were agreed upon during negotiations, the
proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$51.0 million equivalent,
to be made to IRHE wlth the guarantee of the Government of Panama. The loan
would have a repayment period of 15 years, including 3 years of grace.

Alternative A3, Fortuna II                                 Dec. 1987
a/ Possible the Esti-Barrigan hydro-project.  In this study data for the
Changuinola project was used.
b/ Since Fortuna I is a common project to all alternatives, its investment
was not included in the analysis.

Alternative BI represents the substitution of the Fortuna II project by a
thermal power plant of equivalent capacity; given the time constraint to
construct any other hydroelectric project this would be the only alterna-
tive available to IRHE if the energy market growth is to be met with adequate
reserve margins to assure good service.
2. FUEL COSTS, 0 & M COSTS AND PLANT LIFE
The following table presents thermal efficiency, fuel costs and 0 & M
costs considered for existing and new power plants:
0 & M Costs
Type of   Efficiency  Fuel Price a/  Fixed  Variable
Fuel      kWh/gal       US$/bbl       US$/kW US$/MWh
Bahia-Las Minas          Bunker C      11.95        27.00         31.20    0.10
San Francisco
No. 3 Plant           Bunker C       9.70        27.00         78.00    5.50
San Francisco
Diesel Plant          Bunker C      15.70        27.00         27.80    2.00
Small Diesels            Diesel        11.90        34.00         24.60   28.10
Gas Turbines             Diesel        10.30        34.00          4.00    0.90
Steam Power Plants       Bunker C      12.10        27.00         31.20    0.10
a/  CIF price based on international FOB prices for petroleum of US$
29.00/bbl1  remaining constant in real terms during the period of
analysis.
The following plant life was assumed for the generation projects:
Hydro-electric projects            50 years
Steam power plants                 30 years
Gas turbines                       20 years
3.  ECONOMIC COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVES
Present value for the four alternatives, at various discount rates:
Present Value - US$ Million
Discount Rate
10%        12%         14%
Alternative
Al:  Fortuna II in 1989                          537.2        476.5     424.1
A2:  Fortuna II in 1988                          525.3        466.6     415.9
A3:  Fortuna II in 1987                          514.7        457.8     408 7
B1:  Steam Plant in 1989                         600.7        528.3     466.6



- 50 -
ANNEX 4.5
Page 3 of 3
Under the assumed conditions, the least cost solution is to construct the
Fortuna II project as early as possible (earliest possible year is 1987).
Fuel Cost Variations
A sensitivity analysis was made for fuel price, considering variations above
and below the prices for the base cost (at 12% discount rates):
Present Value - US$ Million
Alternative                                        Fuel Price Variations
-15%     -10%     Base     +10%
Al: Fortuna II in 1989                       447.8    457.4    476.5    495.6
A2: Fortuna II in 1988                       440.1    448.9    466.6    484.2
A3: Fortuna II in 1987                       433.3    441.5    457.8    474.1
B1:  Steam Plant in 1989                     492.9    504.7    528.3    551.9
Fuel price has little influence in the relative position of the alternatives,
and the basic conclusion on the least cost solution does not change.
Effect of Cost Over-Run on Delays in the Fortuna 1L Project
Present Value - US$ Million
Fortuna II Project                                  (12% Discount Rate)
- Case A3-a: No delays, but
cost over-run of 100%                                    486.3
- Case A3-b: No delays, but
cost over-run of 200%                                    515.5
- Case Al-a: Delay of 2 years
to 1989, cost over-run of 200%                           529.9
Since the present value of the first two cases is lower than Alternative B1
(PV - 528.3 US$ million), it is concluded that even if the Fortuna II project
costs three times as much as estimated, it cannot economically be substituted
by a steam power plant of equivalent capacity. However, if in addition to
200% cost overrun the project is delayed by two years, the alternative of a
steam power plant is more economical.
4. SELECTED ALTERNATIVE
Under strictly economic considerations, the construction of the Fortuna
II project (raising of the existing dam) as early as possible represents the
least cost solution to meet IRHE's power demand growth up to 1990, the year
when additional capacity would be required. In addition, for technical
reasons, the construction of Fortuna II is imperative, as described in the
text (para. 4.07).
