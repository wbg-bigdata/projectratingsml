INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOIMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO US$51.0 MILLION
TO INSTITUTO DE RECURSOS HIDRAULICOS Y ELECTRIFICACION
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PANAMA
FOR A SEVENTH POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Instituto de Recursos Hidraulicos y Electrificacion (IRHE) with the
a   guarantee of the Republic of Panama for the equivalent of US$51.0 millioa
to help finance a Seventh Power Project. The loan would have a term of 15
years, including 3 years of grace, with interest at the standard variable
rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled -Panama: Special Economic Report - Metro-
politan Unemployment (3833-PAN) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on June 7, 1982. A further economic report entitled -Panama: Structural
Change and Growth Prospects- has been discussed in draft with the
Government and will shortly be distributed to the Executive D!rectors. The
updated findings of these Reports are summarized below. Co-ntry data
sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        In October 1984, Panama's first democratically elected Government
in 16 years took office, headed by President Nicolas Ardito Barletta.  It
confronts a serious economic situation. Real per capita output has
stagnated since 1980, and CDP since 1982. The principal growth sources
since 1970-the public sector and the internationally-oriented service
sectors-have dried up. Unemployment, especially in the Panama City -
Colon Metropolitan Area, is high (about 12 percent in mid 1983) and
rising. It could soon become a divisive social issue. The public sector
is under a severe financial constraint; it must service, under conditions
of acute scarcity of commercial credit, an external debt of 73 percent of
GDP, larger in relative terms than those of Argentina, Brazil or Mexico.
The export-oriented services are heavily dependent on the Latin American
market; their recovery therefore depends on the still doubtful prospects
for the Region as a whole. Agriculture and manufacturing have stagnated
since 1979. They have suffered from an inward-oriented incentive structure
and an inappropriate policy framework.
4.        The public sector expansion in the 1970's had three main
objectives: to eliminate rural poverty, to increase national control over
the economy, including the Panama Canal, and to create new sources of
economic growth. Social programs in health and education were extended to



-2-
mast are^s, and an agrarian reform program was initiated. The second goal
w.rAs achieved by the U.S--Panamanian Treaty of 1979. Major investmeals were
undertaken in transport, tourism, international commercial infrastructure,
water supply and sewerage, and power, mostly to provide support for
expected private activities. Power and most telecommunications facilities
were nationalized. New State enterprises were created for export crops
such as sugar, citrus, and bananas; and a state-owned cement plant was
built. Self-sufficiency in basic foodstuffs such as rice, corn, and beans
was also accorded h_h priority.
5.        The Government's social programs have had considerable success in
enhancing the quality of life in Panama, as reflected in demographic,
health and educational indicators. Infant mortality fell by 33 percent
between 1970 and 1982, while the birth rate fell by over 20 percent.
Access to potable water for the rural population increased from 41 percent
in 1970 to 70 percent in 1982. The proportion of the population enrolled
in schools of all types iacreased from less than one-quarter to 37 percent
between 1968 and 1982. In 1984, 59 percent of the population had access to
electricity compared to 52 percent in 1970. The Government's goal is to
increase this to 62 percent by 1986. Despite these achievements, estimates
indicate that some 20 percent of the urban and 30 percent of the rural
population continue to live in poverty.
6.         As regards the Government's economic programs, the service
sector has benefitted greatly from an export oriented incentive structure
which has enabled the private sector to build upon Panama's favorable
geographic position and entrepot tradition. Growth was concentrated in
financial services, commerce and the Colon Free Zone. Between 1982 and
1984 this expansion was halted by the financial crisis which afflicts the
Latin America Region. Policy efforts in agriculture and industry have been
less successful. AgriCultural programs have led to self-sufficiency in
rice at considerable financial and economic cost, and increased the output
of milk, but have had less impact on the output of beef and feed grains.
State sugar mills have increased production but they operate unprofitably.
Similarly, State enterprises in tourism and cement have been a burden on
the fisc. The public enterprises' direct competition with private
enterprises and uncertainties relating to Government labor and price
policies adversely affect the climate for private investment.
7.        The high level of outlays for economic and social infrastructure,
coupled with the substantial losses of State enterprises, resulted in
significant increases in the public sector deficit, despite periodic
efforts to strengthen the public finances. This deficit increased from
4.4 percent of GDP in 1970 to over 15 percent of GDP in 1978, before
falling to 6 percent in both 1980 and 1981 in compliance with a series of
Standby rrangements with the IMF.  In 1982, however, the public sector
deficit widened to 11 percent of GDP, well in excess of the Standby
program. Because Panama has no central bank or control over its currency,



-3-
the anthorities cannot finance their deficit by resorting to central bank
credit. Deficits are, therefore, met by borrowings denominated in US
dollars. Outstanding external public debt (including some short-term debt)
increased by almost one-fifth during 1982, co reach USS3.1 billion, or 73
percent of GDP. Interest payments on chis debt absorbed 30 percent of
total public sector revenues.
8.        This situation prompted the Authorities to take a series of
*         corrective actions from late 1982 through 1984.  The Government reduced the
public sector deficit to 6 percent of GDP in 1983, while preliminary
figures suggest a similar result for 1984. This was achieved mainly by new
L         revenue measures and reduced capital expenditures.  Budgetary controls have
been considerably strengthened, and the public investment program for
1983-84 thoroughly rationalized. Public capital outlays in both years were
substantially lower than in 1981-82 and a number of projects were cancelled
or postponed. These measures were supported by a two year Standby-cum CFF
Arrangement with the IXF of about USS230 million, of which USS120 million
were made available in 1983 and the rest in 1984. The Government submitted
its 1985 budget to the National Assembly in January as the first stage in
assembling a financial package for 1985 and 1986. Once approved, the
budget may provide a basis for negotiation of a new IMF Standby Arrangement
which, in turn, would facilitate a rescheduling of commercial amortizations
which fall due through December 1986.
9.        In 1983, the Government embarked upon a program of medium-term
structural adjustment. A number of important measures were taken with a
view to creating an environment where private initiative could generate
the buoyancy in economic activity no longer provided by the financially
weakened public sector. They included rationalization of public sector
institutions, reduction of efiective protection, reforms in the structure
of incentives and changes in pricing policies. These measures were
supported by a successfully completed Structural Adjustment Loan. The
Government has stated its intention of continuing its economic reform
program, concentrating ics efforts particularly on further improving
public sector efficiency, encouraging export oriented agricultural and
industrial activities, and addressing labor market rigidities with a view
to increasing employment.
10.       Due to the past high levels of public investment, much of the
infrastructure required for private sector activitv is already in place.
Financial, communications and transport facilities are good while Panama's
workforce is among the best educated in the area. The prospects for growth
would be further enhanced through more rational use of land and facilities
reverted to Panama, and of the higher earnings received, under the Canal
Treaty. Implementation of the Treaty began on October 1, 1979, and will be
completed on December 31, 1999, when the Canal and all ancillary facilities
will revert to Panama. Already the ports of Balboa, Cristobal and Coco
Solo Norte, two abandoned airfields, much valuable land, and most service
outlets of the former Panama Canal Company's supply division have reverted
to Panama. The reverted land enhances the attraction of the metropolitan



-4-
area, along the Canal from the Atlantic to the Pacific, as the best site
for activities to take advantage of Panama's excellent geographic
location.
11.       Conditions for longer-term growth of the Panamanian economy
are favorable, given its geographic advantages, educated workforce, low
population|land ratio, and adequate physical infrastructure. The
medium-term outlook is both more austere and dependent on key domestic
policies and on the international economy. The scope and depth of the
structural adjustment measures already taken indicate the Government's keen
awareness of these issues.  However, the continuation and deepening of the
economic reform program is vital if the country is to return to a growth                   e
path. This implies addressing difficult issues such as labor market
rigidities and the structure of incentives in agriculture and industry. In
order to promote greater efficiency in the directly productive sectors, the
Government would gradually open the economy to international competition
while at the same time improving the efficiency of public services and
programs. The cost of providing basic public services, like the utilities
and the ports, would be reduced through both carefully chosen investments,
such as the present project, and improved procedures and practices. At the
same time, the Government has a continuing dialogue with the private sector
and is aggressively pursuing a program to attract internationally
integrated assembly industries. Procedures for establishing plants and
granting incentives have been simplified, and labor is now being trained in
accordance with the specific requirements of incoming firms. Nevertheless,
medium-term recovery of the very open Panamanian economy also depends on
continued recovery in world economic activity.
12.       The Government has acted decisively to reduce the public sector
deficit. Moreover, it has made an excellent beginning to its medium term
structural adjustment program which the Bank supported through the fully
disbursed first Structural Adjustment Loan. Related Technical Assistance
is helping to identify key areas for further policy reform. The 1985
public investment budget continues to reflect not only a recognition of the
need for austerity but a high standard in selecting priority projects.
Together with the country's excellent prior record in meeting its debt
service obligations, this should provide a sound basis for continued
creditworthiness.  This will, however, depend on Panama's ability to
sustain its program of fiscal adjustment, to ensure a continuing stable
financial environment, and its clear commitment to medium term economic
reform to permit a speedy return of economic growth.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       The Bank has to date made 29 loans and one supplementary loan to
Panama totalling USS541.3 million (net of cancellations). Of these, 18
loans for US$310.4 million (net of cancellations) are fully disbursed,



-5-
three for roads totalling US$25 million; one for an airport project for
USS20 million; four for agriculture totalling US$13.9 million; five for
power for USS141.0 million; one each for ports for US$24 million, water
supply and sewerage for US$12.0 million, development banking for US$14.2
million and US$60.2 for a structural adjustment program (SAL). Ongoing
loans support projects for livestock credit; development of tropical tree
crops; development banking; road rehabilitation; the power sector (a
supplementary loan for generation, and a loan for transmission and
distribution); energy planning; the water supply and sewerage sector; the
urban development of Colon; port development; and technical assistance
associated with the SAL. The most recent loans to Panama, for the SAL and
associated technical assistance, were approved by the Executive Directors
on November 15, 1983.
14.       IFC has made three investments in Panama.  The first was a
coimnitent in 1971 to acquire US$0.3 million of equity in the Corporacion
de Desarrollo Hotelero, S.A., and to lend to the Corporacion US$1.2 million
to build a new international hotel. The second was a commitment in
December 1977 to lend US$2.4 million and acquire US$1.4 million in equity
in Vidrios Panamenos, S.A., the first glass container factory in Panama.
These projects have been satisfactorily completed. The third is a
commitment in 1979 to acquire US$2.5 million in equity in the Banco
Latinoamericano de Exportaciones (BLADEX), a regional export bank promoted
by the Government of Panama.
15.       While there are some difficulties, satisfactory overall progress
in the implementation of ongoing projects is reflected in the steady
increase in Bank disbursements from US$31 million in FY81 to US$39 million
in FY82 and to US$39.6 million in FY83. In FY84, with the successful
implementation of the SAL, disbursements rose to US$94.1 million. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of
September 30, 1984.
16.       The overall aim of Bank lending strategy in Panama is to assist
the Government in carrying out its economic reform program. This seeks to
achieve a return to growth via the export-led expansion of private sector
activities. Experience in countries which have become successful exporters
*       shows that efficient, low cost public services such as electricity, water
and communications, are essential elements in a successful growth
strategy. In Panama, this implies prudent investments accompanied by
institutional reforms in the public sector. These aim to provide the
consumer with a reliable, lower cost service while ensuring the financial
soundness of the institutions concerned. In addition to assisting
structural reform, including institutional reform in the public sector,
high priority is accorded to the further development of Panama's supporting
infrastructure and service industries. Specifically, the Bank assists those
sectors in which it can make a special contribution in terms of: (i)
developing policies and institutions; (ii) removing infrastructure



-6-
bottlenecks; and (iii) better utilizing the country's natural resources,
including its geographic location. The proposed project is fully
consistent with these goals. By tturther reducing IRHE's reliance on
expensive thermal generation it will enable demand to be satisfied at a
lower unit cost, while at the same time relying on the country's own
hydroelectric resources. The technical assistance component will seek to
improve the quality of the entity's future investment program. It will
take place in the context of further Bank-financed assistance which the
Authorities have requwsted in order to increase cost efficiency in the                      e
public utilities and -ther important state institutions. Other projects
under consideration for Bank lending include a second structural adjustment
operation, a second technical assistance project oriented mainly towards
reform of public sector institutions, and a Trans-Isthmian transport
development project.
17.       Both the USAID and the IDB have invested substantial amounts in
agriculture and social services (including family planning and housing in
the case of USAID). Past lending patterns are likely to persist, at least
as regards the social services, because the Government prefers to borrow on
concessionary terms for these sectors, while utilizing other assistance for
projects which are expected to result in more immediate economic benefits.
In addition to agriculture and social services, the 1DB is financing road
construction, agricultural credit, industry and telecommunications; these
are sectors in which ic is likely to continue lending. The IDB also
participated with the Bank in the financing of the first stage of the
Fortuna Hydroelectric Project and is financing a rural electrification
program. USAID expects to continue its efforts in housing, manpower
training and projects oriented toward environmental protection. USAII) is
also lending for alternative sources of energy (other than petroleum), and
is supporting the Government's economic reform efforts with non-project
related grants and credits.
18.       The Bank's share of Panama's publicly-guaranteed external debt
outstanding and disbursed was 8.7 percent at the end of 1983 and the Bank's
share of public external debt service was less than 6.5 percent in the same
year. These percentages are expected to increase slightly in the late
1980's
PART III - THE SECTOR
19.       Internationally oriented services (the Panama Canal, Colon Free
Zone industrial and commercial operations, transit services, and banking)
play an important role in the Panamanian economy and represent more than 70
percent of GDP. This is reflected in the heavily urbanized population.
Therefore the Governmenc has consistently given high priority to the
development of the supporting infrastructure, including the provision of
electric power. In addition, the supply of electricity and other essential



-7-
services to provincial towns and rural areas helps the economic development
in the provinces, improves social conditions and mitigates migration to
the metropoLitan areas of Panama City and Colon.
Energy Resources and Service
20.       Panama depends on imported petroleum for about 90 percent of its
total commercial energy supply. Coupled with a national campaign for
conservation, the Government adopted in the late 1970s a policy for
substituting hydro for thermal electric power generation. This has helped
reduce the share of thermal generation from 94 percent in 1975 to 31
percent in 1984, while total sales increased from 1,026 GWh to 1,815 GWh.
By December 1984, 67 percent of IRHE's total installed capacity was
hydroelectric. Approximately 29 percent of electricity consumption is
residential, while 32 percent is commercial, reflecting the importance of
the services sector in the economy. Industry accounts for about 12 percent
and the Government and street lighting for about 20 percent. Other
consumers represent 7 percent. Between 1970 and 1980 electricity
consumption increased at an average annual rate of 8.8 percent, while real
GDP grew at an annual average of 4.5 percent.  The average rate of increase
of electricity consumption between 1977 and 1984 dropped to 6.4 percent due
to conservation measures, generation restrictions and, more recently, the
sluggishness in the economy. Per capita electricity consumption in 1984,
was about 940 kWh, among the highest in Latin America. In 1984, 81 percent
of the urban population and 42 percent of the rural population (59 percent
of the total) had access to electricity. The goal of IRHE is to extend the
service to reach 85 percent of the urban, and 45 percent of the rural,
population (62 percent of the total population) by 1986.
21.       The potential for increasing renewable energy supply lies mainly
in hydropower development. IRHE has identified hydro sites with a
potential of about 6600 MW, and has carried out pre-feasibility and
feasibility studies for 13 of these, which have a potential of about 1900
MW, with assistance from the United Nations Development Programme (UNOP).
When developed, these 13 sites would meet the country's requirements over
the next 25 years. Sweden is financing feasibility studies for three of
these projects with a combined capacity of 120 MW, and the proposed project
*       would finance the feasibility studies of another two sites with about 160
MW installed capacity.   In addition, preliminary studies are being
prepared for the installation of 25 mini-hydro plants to serve isolated
communities.
Energy Planning
22.       Panama's National Energy Cormission (CONADE), created in 1980 as
an advisory body to the President of the Republic, is in charge of studying
and planning all matters related to energy supply and consumption in
Panama. It is headed by IRIE's Director General and operates with



-8-
personnel of IRHE's Planning Directorate. The Energy Planning and
Petroleum Exploratton Promotion Project, assisted by Loan No. 1954-PAN, of
April 23, 1981, includes studies and surveys for geothermal and petroleum
resources and coal deposits. Preliminary investigations indicate a
potential of about 400 MW from geothermal resources and further surveys are
being carried out. Preliminary surveys show no indication of any sizeable
petroleum resources, but there appears to be a reasonable potential for
coal deposits. The Government has, therefore, decided to cancel the
petroleum exploration component of the project. IRHE is also conducting
experiments to utilize other renewable energy sources, but these are not
expected to contribute significantly to Panama's energy supply in the near
future.
Power Sector Organization
23.       IRHE, an autonomous Government agency created in 1961, is
responsible for all public sector power supply in Panama. IRHE's Board of
Directors, chaired by the Minister of Planning and Economic Policy, is
responsible for power sector policies. There is no separate regulatory
body for the sector, and tariffs have to be approved by the Cabinet, upon
the recommendation of IRHE's Board, through the Economic Cabinet (chaired
by the Minister for the Presidency of the Republic). IRHE has competent
management and technical staff. IRHE's organization, administration and
systems have benefitted from substantial technical assistance provided
under previous Bank loans (Paras. 28-33 below).
Power Sector Development and Strategy
24.       With the completion of the Fortuna plant at the end of 1984,
IRHE's installed capacity reached 824 MW, of which about 69 percent was
hydroelectric capacity. The Panama Canal Commission has an additional 210
bW and other agencies have another 61 MW capacity (a total of 271 MW) in
areas not yet served by IRHE.
25.       The main objectives of IRHE's expansion program are:  (a) to
extend service coverage and improve its quality at the least cost; (b) to
integrate the small isolated systems into the regional systems; (c) to
interconnect the regional systems through a high-voltage national grid; and
(d) to develop the country's hydro and geothermal resources to both satisfy
increased demand and substitute for high cost thermal generation. The
present expansion program is based on a Master Plan for 1979-2003, prepared
by IRHE in 1976, with the assistance of consultants. IRHE updates the Plan
periodically. Currently the Plan covers the period 1984-2003 and consists
of the second stage of the Fortuna Project (the proposed project), and the
installation of a third 75 MW generating unit at the Bayano hydroelectric
plant in 1990. Due to current financial constraints, the construction of
the 300 MW Changuinola hydroelectric project, originally scheduled for
operation in 1992, has been postponed and is being replaced by smaller
power plants.  The development program also includes the necessary

transmission and distribution systems to extend the service, and the
interconnection of the national grid with the Costa Rican grid. From
1985, when the Fortuna Hydroelectric Project is in full operation, al]ost
all electricity requirements in Panama wi11 be met by hydroelectric power.
The construction prog.:am would be updated in 1986, after completion of
additional studies on medium size hydroelectric projects and geothermal
resources.
26.       With the assistance of consultants and IDB financing, ERHE is
carrying out the first stage of a five-,ear rural electrification program,
which includes the installation of 1,400 km of transmission lines to serve
12,500 new customers.
Sector Constraints
27.       The main constraints to the development of the sector are the
high investment cost of the hydro expansion program, and the relatively
high electricity Icsses (15.3 percent in 1983, and 17.7 percent in 1984).
Bank and IDB participation in IRHE's development programs has been an
irlortant catalyst for enabling IREE to obtain financing from other
official sources and commercial banks for its investment needs. Most of
the balance of the cost of IRHE's development programs is covered from its
own internal cash generation. The Government has provided minor amounts to
cover part of these costs as equity contributions, but such contributions
would not be needed in the future. IRHE's capabilities to develop and
manage the system are being enhanced through improvements in organization,
canagement, systems and training.  In the meantime, consultants are hired
to provide missing expertise. System losses are also being given
increasing attention bv IRHE's management. A UNDP-financed, Bank-executed,
power system loss reduction study was completed in 1983. IRHE is
implementing the study's recommendations.
Bank Participation in the Power Sector
28.       Since 1962, the Sank has made six loans and a supplemental loan
to IRHE, totalling USS204.4 million. These have helped to finance
hydroelectric and thermal plants and their associated transmission,
*        sub-transmission and distribution components.  Bank participation has
facilitated the inflow of foreign commercial financing to the sector on
appropriate terms. The Bank has assisted IRHE and the Government to
establish electricity rates which are consistent with long-run marginal
cost and to generate a substantial part of the funds required for
investment programs in the sector. Bank assistance has also contributed to
sector organization and planning; to the review of IRHE's development
plans; to improving IRHE's organizational structure, to introducing
management and accounting systems; and to do-eloping IRHE's staff training
programs.
29.       The First Power Project (Loan 322-PAN of 1962; US$4 million)
helped finance a small hydroelectric plant in Central Panama and was
completed without major difficulties. The Second Power Project (Loan



661-PAM of 1970 for USS42 million) helped financp the tirst stage or the
Bayano hydroelectric plant; some diesel and steam generating units;
associated transmission; expansion of IRHE's distribution system; and
studies, training and consultants' services. The project was completed il..
1976 with a delay of about 22 months and cost overruns amounting to about
84 percent of appraisal estimates. These were due to the need to change
the consulting engineers, problems with the main contractor, remporary
shortages of materials and higher than expected inflation rates in
1972-75. The Project Performance Audit Report (Report No. 2508-OED, dated
May 15, 1979) was distributed to the Executive Directors.
30.       Loan 948-PAN for US$30 million made in 1973, financed the Third
Pbwer Project consisting of diesel generation, htgh-voltage transmission, a
national load dispatch and communication center, sub-transmission and
distribution and studies and training. The Project was substantially
completed by the end of 1977, the original completion date. Nevertheless,
some of the sub-transmission works included in the project suffered
substantial delays and were completed only in mid-1980. The delays were
due mainly to IRHE's then lack of experience with sub-transmission and
distribution projects, to difficulties with contractors and to the
concentration of IRHE's efforts on the large generation and transmission
projects under execution.   The project was successfully completed and
cost, in current prices, was 27 percent over the appraisal estimate. The
Project Completion Report was issued in June 1982.
31.       Loan 1470-PAN, for USS42 million, made in 1977, helped in the
financing of the Fourth Power Project which comprises the 300-MW Fortuna
hydroelectric plant, associated transmission, an organizational improvement
program and training. The project was originally cofinanced by IDB and
suppliers. Due tc unforeseen geological conditions, the project suffered
cost overruns of about 93 percent.  A supplemental loan for USS31.3 million
towards financing the cost overrun of the -'omponents originally financed by
the Bank was approved by the Executive Directors on March 29, 1983.
Additional financing towards the cost overrun cane from IDB (USS60.0
million), bilateral sources (USS37.3 million) and commercial banks (USS77.1
million).  Construction of the dam was completed in February 1983.  The
first generating unit entered commercial operation in June 1984. The
second unit was commissioned in August and the last unit in October 1984,
with 16 months' delav.   The project remains the least cost solution for
providing the needed energy, with a rate of return of about 17 percent.
32.       Loan 1778-PAIN for USS23 million made in 1980 assists in the
rehabilitation and expansion of IRHE's distribution systems ac-ross the
country, which in turn will reduce losses and improve service quality. The
Loan also cofinances with IDB the interconnection between the Panamanian
and Costa Rican systems. The project is expected to be completed in 1985,
one year behind schedule. A cost overrun of about 50 percent, due to the
expansion of the scope of the project and higher than estimated local
costs, was financed from IRHE's own resources. Loan 2313-PAN for USS32.1
million made in 1983 is financing additional components of IRHE's
distribution system across the country. Project execution is satisfactory.

33.       Bank continued assistance to the power sector aimis to support the
Government's economic reform program by increasing IRHE's efficiency and
reducing the cost of its services (paras. 9 and 16).  After completion of
the proposed second stage of the Fortuna Project, and with the progress
already achieved in the sector, the Bank would mainly focus on the special
areas where its assistance can be most effective in mobilizing resources,
in providing technical assistance in the proper areas, in increasing TRHE's
efficiency, in upgrading and expanding its training activities to meet
rapid erowth and in the review of its investment programs.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
34.       The proposed project is a second stage of the Fortuna
Hydroelectric Project initiated under the Fourth Power Project (Loan No.
1470-PAN), and represents an important step in continuing the reductinn of
dependence on thermal power generation. The project was prepared hb IRHE
with assistance from consultants, and was appraised in February-March
1984. Negotiations were held in Washington in !NIovember, 1984 and completed
in Panama in January 1985. IRHE's delegation was led by Dr. Victor Carlos
Urrutia, Deputy Director General of IRHE and the Government was represented
by Dr. Ricaurte Vasquez, Minister of Planning and Economic Poiicv. The
appraisal mission's report, entitled Staff ApDraisal Report - Panama
Seventh Power Project- (No. 5211-PAN, dated February 19, 1985) is being
distributed separately. Annex III contains a supplementarv project data
sheet.
Project Objectives and Description
35.       The proposed project aims to increase the generation capacitv of
the Edwin Fabrega (Fortuna) Power Plant to meet growing denand from
residential, commercial, and industrial uisers in support of Panama's
economic and social development. The project would also include the
preparation of feasibility studies for medium size hvdroelectric plants to
support the future development of the svstem, and an asset revaluation
study. Bank support to the project would assist in meering the growing
£      demand for electricity, continue efforts in the gtrengthening of IRHE,
the quality of IRHE's investment program and of future project preparation
and enable IRHE to complete development of the hydraulic resources at the
-      project site.  The project would also assure the security of the dam hy
increasing its capacity to meet probable maximium flood conditions.
36.       The project consists of the following components:
(a) raising the height of the existing darr of the Fortuna Project by
40 meters to increase its generating capacity bv 247 GWh p.a.
using the existing generation equipment;



- 12 -
(b) field investigation of ten medium-size hydroelectric projects,
pre-feasibility for three out of them, and feasibility studies
for the selected two projects for future construction to meet
growing demand; and
(c) an asset revaluation study.
Implementation
37.       IRHE carried out preparatory works, such as clearing of organic
materials to foundation level, access roads, clearing of borrow pits,
construction of camps, etc., while executing the first stage of the dam.
Civil works under the project for raising the dam would be carried out by a
single contractor. In view of the experience gained during the
construction of Fortuna I, supervision of construction and of dam safety
would be carried out by IRHE, with general assistance from consultants as
needed, including periodic reviews by IRHE's Board of Consultants.
Construction would be completed by the end of 1988.
Technical Assistance
38.       The execution of the studies for the medium size hydroelectric
projects would be carried out by IRHE's Planning Directorate, together with
a group of 15 local engineers, assisted by a foreign consulting firm to be
contracted for all three phases of the study (field investigations for 10
projects, pre-feasibility for 3 out of them and feasibility studies for the
selected two projects). The project would require 240 man-months local and
86 man-months foreign engineers and otber professionals. The asset
revaluation study would be carried out mainly by IRHE's staff, assisted by
ten man-months of consulting services.
IRHE's Financial Situation
39.       Since 1977, IRHE has sustained an improving trend in its
financial performance which is expected to continue. In 1977, in
connection with the Fourth Power Project (Loan 1470-PAWN), IRHE and the
Government agreed to a program for financial recovery calling, inter alia,
for: (i) tariff increases allowing IRHE to reach rates of return of 7
percent in 1977, 8 percent in 1978 and 8.75 percent in 1979 and thereafter;
(ii) Government equity contributions totalling USS49.5 million over the
1977-81 period; and (iii) settlement of overdue accounts by the Government
and its agencies. These financial agreements were maintained in connection
with the Fifth Power Project (Loan 1778-PAN) and the Sixth Power Project
(Loan 2313-PAN). IRHE and the Government have been substantially in
compliance with the above undertakings, except for the periodic
accumulation of puzblic sector arrears. Due to an adequate tariff policy,
which has kept pace with inflation and fuel prices, and reflects the
long-run marginal cost, IRHE's actual rates of return increased from 6.9
percent in 1977 to 9.2 percent in 1981. In January 1982, IRHE raised its



- 13 -
basic tariff again by 6 percent. However, due to two unusually dry seasons
which demanded higher than forecast thermal generation, the rate of return
fell to 7.4 percent in 1982 and 5.2 percent in 1983, but is forecast to
rise to an estimated 9.7 percent in 1984 with the return of normal
rainfall. The entry in operation of the Fort-na hydropower plant replacing
thermal generation (para. 31 above) permitted the reduction of the fuel
surcharge, resulting in a reduced total charge to the consumer of 7
percent, in April 1984. It is expected that IRHE will achieve a rate of
return of 8.1 percent in 1985 and 1986, rising to 8.75 percent in 1987 and
therafter. During this period, tREIE would generate enough cash internally
to meet its financial obligations and amortize US$48 million of its short
term debt. Self-financing, debt service coverage and other financial
ratios have also ranged close to agreed figures. It is forecast that
IRHE's debt service coverage will rise from the 1.0 ratio in 1983 to 2.0 in
1988, and that its debt equity ratio will fall from 50/50 to 20/80 in
1989. IRHE would continue to adjust its tariffs from time to time in order
to achieve a rate of return of 8.1 percent on its average revalued net
fixed assets in operation plus working capital amounting to three months'
revenues in 1985 and 1986, and a rate of return of 8.75 percent thereafter
(Section 5.07(a) of the draft Loan Agreement). This is consistent with the
rate of return specified in Panama's electricity legislation. The adequacy
of the rate of return would be reviewed by IRHE and the Bank as necessary
(Section 5.07(b) of the draft Loan Agreement). In order to avoid
recurrence of some disadvantageous bulk sale contracts in the mid-1970's,
IRHE would not sell electricity to bulk consumers at prices lower than its
long-run marginal cost (Section 5.05 of the draft Loan Agreement).
40.       IRHE's fixed assets would be revalued annually (Section 5.01(b)
of the draft Loan Agreement). Fixed asset evaluation was carried out in
1976 and adjusted annually thereafter for purposes of the calculation of
the rate of return, on the basis of a formula agreed with the Bank. In
order to ensure the appropriateness of the evaluation, IRHE would carry out
a complete evaluation study of the current value of its fixed assets
(replacement cost) under the proposed project. This study would be
completed by June 30, 1987 (Section 3.01(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Consultants would be hired as needed to assist IRHE.
41.       In order to fill the gaps resulting from the lack of long-term
financing for its construction program in 1980-82, IRHE resorted to
excessive short- and medium-term borrowing, which threatened its financial
position.  To avoid a recurrence, IRHE would not incur any short term debt
if this would cause its total short term debt to exceed 20 percent of its
cash operating, maintenance and administrative expenses during the
preceding 12 months (Section 5.04(a) of the draft Loan Agreement).  IRHE
would also not incur, without Bank approval, any long term debt if its net
revenues do not cover its maximum future debt service requirements more
than 1.4 times (Section 5.04(b) of the draft Loan Agreement).



- 14 -
42.       At the end of December 1984, overdue payments from municipalities
and autonomous agencies for electricity consumption reached US$20.7
million. During January 1985 these agencies settled approximately US$8
million of their arrears. Payment of the balance of these arrears would be
made according to an agreed schedule (Section 3.02(a) of the draft
Guarantee Agreement). Arrears of autonomous agencies would be paid over
two years and those of municipalities, over five years. Future debts of
all government agencies and municipalities would not exceed 60 days of
electricity billings (Section 3.02 (b) of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
Until 1984, municipalities were charged for street lighting at two thirds
of the regular tariff, with the balance included in private customers'
tariff.  Revenue from street lighting represent approximately 1.2 percent
of IRHE's total revenues. In order to avoid future delays in payments for
this consumption, the two thirds of the public lighting at present billed
to municipalities is being included in the general consumers' tariff as of
January 1, 1985.  In case of any delay. all necessary action to enforce
this tariff change would be completed by June 30, 1985 (Section 5.08 of the
draft Loan Agreement). IRHE would take all necessary measures to maintain
at all times no more than 60 days of electricity billings outstanding and
unpaid (Section 5.06 of the draft Loan Agreement).
43.       Financial projections indicate that, in addition to meeting its
financial obligations, IRHE would generate internally approximately 66
percent of the financing needs for its construction program for 1984-89,
with overall moderate increases in its tariffs. Ia view of savings in fuel
costs due to conversion to hydropower, projected tariff increases would be
in line with projected inflation rates over the coming few years. Until
the proposed project has been completed, IRHE would not undertake, without
Bank agreement, any expansion project not included in this construction
program which would exceed one percent of IRHE's revalued gross fixed
assets in operation (Section 4.05 of the draft Loan Agreement).
44.       Under Loan Nio. 2313-PALN targets for efficiency indicators were
agreed with IRHE, and have been largely met. Essentially the same
indicators would be maintained (Schedule 5 to draft Loan Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
45.       The total cost of the project, excluding interest during
construction, is estimated at USS79.1 million, of which US$51.0 million j54
percent) would be in foreign exchange. IRHE is exempt from duties and
taxes. Cost estimates are based on detailed final designs, and actual cost
data updated in January 1984, according to IRHE's recent experience in the
Fortuna I project. Physical contingencies are 15 percent. Price
contingencies are estimated for local cost at 1.1 percent in 1984, 1.5
percent in 1985, 4 percent in 1986 and 1987 and 5 percent in 1988 and 1989;
and for foreign cost at -2.8 percent in 1984, 5 percent in 1985, 7.5
percent in 1986, and 8 percent in 1987 to 1989. This is consistent with
Bank guidelines.



- 15 -
46.       The proposed loan would finance 100 percent of the foreign
exchange cost of the project. IRHE would finance the total local cost
(US$28.1 million) and interest during construction (US$8.5 million).
Procurement and Disbursement
47.       The civil works contract for the construction of the dam raising
would be established through international competitive bidding, initiated
in 1984 in accordance with Bank guidelines.
48.       The consulting services required for the execution of feasibility
studies of the medium size hydroelectric projects and for the fixed asset
evaluation study would be contracted in accordance with Bank Group
Guidelines for Hiring of Consultants.. Consulting services required for the
supervision of the dam construction would be provided, at the request of
IRHE, by the same professionals who now serve on the Board of Consultants
and by individual experts to be contracted in accordance with Bank
guidelines. The Board of Consultants would also review, from a safety
viewpoint the design and construction of the dam and related str.icture.
49.       Disbursements would be made against 64 percent of total
expenditure for the civil works contract, and against 100 percent of the
foreign exchange cost of consulting services.
Environmental Aspects
50.       In 1976 the Government declared 19,000 ha around the Fortuna dam
as national forestry reserve and an additional 18,000 ha as restricted use
area, all under the control of forestry guards and ecologists hired by
IRHE. No inhabitants would be affected by the elevation of the dam.
However, IRHE, on its own and in collaboration with other Government
agencies, has established community development programs aimed at improving
education, living conditions and agricultural production methods in the
vicinity of the project area. No negative impact is anticipated on human
life or on the environment as a result of the proposed project.
Benefits and Risks
51.       The proposed project would meet the growing projected demand for
electric power through 1991 in support of Panama's economic and social
development, prepare feasibility studies for two medium size hydroelectric
projects for future needs, and continue the support to aid institution
building of IRHE. The internal rate of return on the investment, which is
the least cost solution to supply the electric power, is 19 percent. A
sensitivity analysis made shows that the project costs would have to
increase by 20 percent and benefits to decrease by 20 percent to reduce the
return to 12 percent, which is the estimated cost of capital in Panama.

PART V  - LEGAL INSTRUENTS ND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between IRHE and the Bank, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Panama and the Bank, and the
Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the
Articles of Agreement are being distributed separately. Special conditions
of the loan are listed in Section III of Annex III.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
