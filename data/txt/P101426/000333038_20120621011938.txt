                                  RESTRUCTURING PAPER

    A. SUMMARY

1.      The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the Bolivia Lake Titicaca Local
Sustainable Development Project, an SDR12.8 million (US$20 million equivalent) credit
approved by the World Bank Board on December 20, 2007, is to contribute to local
sustainable development in the Bolivian part of the Lake Titicaca watershed. The Project
has been under implementation for just over four years and progress toward achievement
of these objectives is currently rated as moderately unsatisfactory. The proposed
restructuring is intended to rectify deficiencies in the Project’s implementation
arrangements, and to bring the Project back to satisfactory implementation.

2.       During the supervision mission carried out in June 2011, the Ministry of Cultures,
under which lies the Vice Ministry of Tourism (VMT), an implementing entity for the
Project, expressed the preference that the responsibilities assigned to it by the Project be
limited to the competencies of said Ministry. At that time and subsequently, substantial
changes and turnover of staff within the VMT’s Project executing unit (Equipo Técnico
del Proyecto, ETP) considerably reduced its implementing capacity. In response to these
developments and in order to facilitate timely implementation and completion of
activities and to support completion of the PDO, changes in the implementation
arrangements were agreed. In particular1:

(i) Institutional arrangements - As of January 1, 2012, the Fondo Nacional de Inversión
Productiva y Social (FPS) became the sole agency implementing Project investments and
technical assistance activities. At the Government’s request, the VMT and the ETP under
the Ministry of Cultures is no longer implementing these activities as of this time.

(ii) Project scope – The Project scope is to be reduced to activities already completed;
activities already initiated by VMT, but not completed, which have been transferred to
FPS; and other works originally assigned to FPS for implementation which will be
completed by the extended Project closing date of February 2, 2015. Outstanding
payments and audits for Project activities carried out under VMT responsibility will be
completed by June 30, 2012.

(iii) Monitoring and evaluation - In light of the changes in Project scope outlined above,
the Project’s results framework will be updated to reflect the closure and cancellation of
certain activities and the removal or re-targeting of associated indicators.



1
  While initially designed to take effect by December 31, 2011 to coincide with the end of VMT activities,
the restructuring package has taken longer to process due to the need reach agreement on the issue of
whether to extend the Project, and whether or not to undertake partial cancelation. Formal communication
of this agreement was not completed until April. The ETP has also needed time to account for costs in its
records. Meanwhile, however, Project implementation has continued through a productive relationship with
FPS, as the restructuring was not required for FPS to proceed with the project activities under their
responsibility.
                                                    3
 (iv) Project closing date - To accommodate changes in implementation arrangements
and to allow for completion of the remaining Project activities, as part of the restructuring
the Project closing date will be extended, for the first time, upon the Recipient’s request
from June 30, 2013 to February 2, 2015.

  B. PROJECT STATUS

3.      The Project’s overall implementation progress and its progress towards
achievement of the PDO are currently rated as moderately unsatisfactory. The Project has
only disbursed a total of $2.39 million or 11.95% of the total loan amount since
effectiveness. Due to aforementioned frequent changes in the ETP, contracting of
consultants was at a standstill during FY 2011, making several project activities
unachievable within the initial Project time frame. These delays result from institutional
challenges in the ETP and the need for additional time to gain community acceptance of
subprojects. In addition, Project implementation has suffered from fluctuating support
within the Vice Ministry of Tourism, which has requested that the Project be removed
from its responsibility on the premise that Project activities lie outside the VMT’s
mandate.

4.      Project ratings have been mixed as a result of the above challenges. Project
Management and Financial Management are rated as moderately satisfactory and
Procurement and Monitoring and Evaluation are rated as moderately unsatisfactory.
Counterpart funding and compliance with applicable safeguard policies are rated
satisfactory.

5.       The Bank team is working very closely with the implementing agencies to resolve
hurdles in Project implementation and to ensure that FPS is well placed to move the
project investments forward as the main implementing agency, with a supervision
missions carried out in June 2011 and March 2012, and another mission planned for June.
After a year of limited to no contracting, several activities have been contracted in the
first half of FY2012 (including project works and studies related to water supply systems,
community outreach programs and supervision contracts). The team’s TTL and fiduciary
experts are engaged in a constant dialogue with FPS and VMT. In addition, a number of
measures were adopted during the latest supervision mission (March 1-13, 2012) to
accelerate contracting and execution of sub-projects by FPS. It is expected that the
changes introduced in the restructuring will contribute to an improvement on the overall
implementation performance ratings and progress towards achievement of the PDO.

6.     The Project is in compliance with the conditions for closing date extensions
outlined in OP/BP 13.30. Under the proposed restructuring the Project’s objectives
continue to be achievable; the performance of the Recipient and of the implementing
agency are satisfactory; the executing entity has submitted an Implementation Action
Plan for completing Project activities within the extension period; neither the Credit in




                                             4
particular nor the country in general, is under suspension of disbursements; and there are
no overdue audit reports or interim financial reports2.

     C. PROPOSED CHANGES

7.      In light of the fluctuating support and difficulties experienced by the VMT’s
project executing unit (ETP) and in response to a request from the Ministry of Cultures
seeking to reduce its involvement in project activities lying outside of its core
competencies, FPS has become the only agency implementing Project investment and
technical assistance activities as of January 1, 2012. These changes in implementation
arrangements would be formalized as part of the restructuring. In addition, the Project
scope is being reduced to those activities already completed, those other activities
initiated by VMT which have been transferred to FPS for completion; and civil works
originally assigned to FPS for implementation which can be completed by the proposed
Project closing date of February 2, 2015.

8.      The table below identifies the activities contemplated in the Project’s original
Financing Agreement, and indicates which of these will be removed from or retained in
the restructured Project. The only components being dropped are those that were under
VMT responsibility that have not yet been initiated; some of the retained activities are
slightly modified or reduced as recorded in italics in the table.

Components

9.      The proposed changes to the Project’s components are detailed in the table below.

 The submission of the 2011 Audit for FPS was waived by the Bank due to the low volume of processes
carried out by FPS during that year. The final audit report for VMT is due June 30, 2012 and therefore not
yet due.

Results/indicators

10.     The proposed changes on the results framework include specifically (i) removing
current project development objective indicators one (Geo-tourism survey ratings for key
areas) and three (Quality of the State of the Lake Reports); (ii) removing intermediate
results indicators 1.2 (number of cultural heritage sites protected) and 1.3 (number of
small businesses supported) to reflect the reduction in scope of activities encompassed
under Component 1; (iii) updating the general water and urban core indicators in the
context of the Project’s revised scope; (v) combining intermediate outcome indicators 3.1
(number of tourism studies) and 3.2 (number of municipal land-use management plans)
into a single indicator, and revising target values to accommodate the reduction in scope

                                                   7
of the Technical Assistance component. The Project will measure these indicators
according to the arrangements described in the results framework in Annex 1.

Institutional arrangements

11.    FPS will become the only implementing agency. VMT and the ETP under the
Ministry of Cultures no longer have a role in Project implementation. Outstanding
payments and audits for Project activities carried out under VMT responsibility will be
completed by June 30, 2012.

Procurement

12.    It will not be necessary to amend existing procurement arrangements within the
Financing Agreement, which already provide for all selection methods envisaged under
the proposed restructuring. The FPS procurement plan will be updated to reflect the
changes proposed in this restructuring.

Financing

13.     The following table specifies the categories of Eligible Expenditures that may be
financed out of the proceeds of the Financing (“Category?) in light of the proposed
Restructuring, the allocations of the amounts of the Credit to each Category, and the
percentage of expenditures to be financed for Eligible Expenditures in each Category. As
a result of substantial cost increases for works and uninformed cost estimates at appraisal
(which have since been carefully revised), the total credit amount is necessary to cover
the rest of the activities and remains unchanged at SDR 12,800,000. All unused funds
from canceled VMT activities will be transferred to FPS to allow for full execution of the
remaining activities:

                                                                              Percentage of
