1.     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1    Context at Appraisal

1.      Country Context. Laos is a small, landlocked country whose land area is 70%
sloping hillsides and mountains and whose forests contain globally significant
biodiversity. In 2001, forest cover was estimated between 40.6% to 47%, with annual
deforestation rates estimated at 0.8-1.2% annually. The remaining forest areas were
degraded. “Scientific? forest management based on inventories and reliable growth data
existed only in pilot areas, while the remaining forests were under increasing pressure
from the domestic forest industry with serious excess capacity, and demand originating
from neighboring countries. Along with the likely loss of production forest resources and
associated biodiversity, exploitation had begun to put pressure on the National
Biodiversity Conservation Areas (NBCAs). If these trends prevailed, the forest cover, and
quality of forests, would have continued to decline contrary to the Government’s
objective of increasing forest cover to 60 percent by 2020.

2.       At the time of project design, the forestry sector in Lao PDR was in disarray.
Sector work undertaken by the World Bank in conjunction with Finland and Sweden
highlighted the importance of “putting order? to the commercial exploitation of forests.
Several key areas of weakness were identified, including a legal framework that narrowly
restricted participation in forest management and did not provide the rights and incentives
needed for villagers to be involved in the management of production forest (especially in
log sales and sharing of financial benefits); the capacity of forests to provide benefits and
services was reduced by wasteful, unplanned logging and conversion of forests to other
land uses; harvesting quotas were not calculated based on annual allowable cutting levels
and guidelines for sustainable forestry operations were largely missing; the extent and
location of forests with potential for sustainable management was not known; the treasury
was realizing only about one third of estimated market value of harvested timber in part
because the royalty system was based on administrative price setting which did not
reflect international market prices; forestry organizations were geared towards regulating
and controlling rather than providing services and supporting management of forests by
local communities; monitoring and control systems did not provide timely and reliable
information on forest sector performance; and finally, the installed and operating sawmill
capacity in Lao PDR far exceeded the sustainable supply of timber.

3.     Government Strategy. At a forestry donor roundtable meeting in September 2000,
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) presented its Forestry Vision for 2020,
which recognized the need to reverse the negative forestry trends. The Sustainable
Forestry and Rural Development Project (SUFORD) was designed to address several key
concerns of the Government of Lao (GoL) as expressed in its Letter of Forest
Management Policy in 2003. GoL recognized in particular the need to improve the
performance of its wood industry, including restructuring the sector to align processing
capacity with sustainable raw material supply, revise the system for harvest determination
based on sustainable supply, promote tree planting and management, control
unsustainable harvest and export of non-timber forest products (NTFPs), and prevent

                                             1
encroachment and biodiversity degradation by law enforcement, capacity building and
assisted participation of villagers in poverty eradication and conservation activities.

4.      Rationale for Bank Engagement. SUFORD’s design which invested in both rural
development and natural resource management was well aligned with the Lao PDR
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, 2000-2002) and the Sixth National Socioeconomic
Development Plan (NSEDP, 2006-2010). In the natural resource sectors, the CAS aimed
to assist in removing distorted policies, improving technology, and ensuring appropriate
forest management practices to achieve environmental sustainability. Given the inherent
complexity this sub-sector it was unlikely to attract support from other donors so the
focus on Production Forests was seen as an important strategic choice. Key expectations
from SUFORD were to help demarcate and introduce sustainable forest management in
Production Forest Areas; create sustainable forest management plans for these areas;
enable people to directly participate in and benefit from forest management; support
efforts to monitor and control forest sector activities; ensure adherence to GOL policy
and improve responsiveness to the rights of local stakeholders.

5.     Higher Level Objectives to which the Project Contributed. Forest resources play
a central role in the Lao economy in supporting rural livelihoods and the national
economy. The project design recognized the high dependence of the Lao population on
forest and natural resources and the central role of the forest industry as a major
employer. Rural people comprised 80% of the population and were generally highly
dependent on forests as a source of food, raw materials, traditional medicines, and as a
source of revenue. In many areas, villagers obtained half of their income and protein from
NTFPs. The PAD recognized that it is often the poorest, who are dependent on the
NTFPs and for whom forests act as a safety net.

1.2       Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators

6.      The Project Development Objective (PDO), as stated in both the PAD and the
legal agreements, was to assist the Borrower to achieve the sustainable management of
production forests to alleviate rural poverty in the Project Provinces by implementing the
forest policy reform actions and policies set forth in its Letter of Forest Management
Policy. The specific project objectives were to: (a) improve the policy, legal and
incentive framework enabling the expansion of Participatory Sustainable Forestry
Management (PSFM) throughout the country; (b) bring the country’s priority natural
Production Forests Areas (PFAs) under PSFM; and (c) improve villagers’ well-being and
livelihoods through benefits from sustainable forestry, community development, and
development of viable livelihood systems.

7.      The original project design included three Key Performance (Output) Indicators
as listed below. The PAD did not include PDO indicators and the indicators listed in the
main text and the results framework of the PAD differed from one another.

         Number of village forestry committees established and functional;



                                              2
         Number and area coverage of forest management and annual operational plans;
          and
         Increased participation of women, ethnic minorities, and poor households in forest
          management activities and in leadership roles in Village Forestry Organizations
          (VFOs).


1.3       Revised PDO and Key Indicators, Reasons/Justification

8.      No changes were made to the PDO; however based on implementation
experience, adjustments were made in the project indicators. For clarity purposes, the
specific project objectives from the SUFORD PAD were slightly revised and adopted as
PDO indicators and a fourth PDO indicator related to Component 3 was added. Revised
PDO Indicators were revised and adopted as follows (for details see PAD Annex 1 and
Project Paper Annex 4):

PDO Indicator 1: Policy, legal and incentive framework enables expansion of PSFM
throughout the country;

PDO Indicator 2: Priority natural production forests in the project areas are brought
under PSFM;

PDO Indicator 3: Villagers wellbeing and livelihoods improved through benefits from
sustainable forestry and community development efforts; and

PDO Indicator 4: Forest sector monitoring and control system functioning.

1.4       Main Beneficiaries

9.       Main project beneficiaries were to include about 100,000 villagers involved in
field implementation and GOL through improved quality of forest management and
improved rent capture and revenue collection. Other direct beneficiaries were to include
district, provincial and national forestry, rural development, and other government staff,
who would receive support and training. Out of 354 villages, an estimated 190 would be
directly involved with forest management. The other villages were adjacent to the
production forests and would very likely be involved in forest protection activities. In
areas, where these adjacent villages have traditionally enjoyed access to natural forests in
other village territories, ways of allowing this system to continue would be promoted. In
addition, villages that did not have good access to natural forests would receive special
benefits through targeted support through the Village Development Sub-component.

1.5       Original Components

10.    The project had four components with the following baseline costs (including
contingencies):



                                              3
Component 1: Support Services for Sustainable Forest Management (US$ 0.99 million,
6% of baseline cost). This component was to provide support for policy development,
systems and guidelines development, remote sensing assessment of forest areas, setting
up databases, mapping, planning, field demarcation, and training facility and capacity
development. It was divided into four sub-components:

   a) Sectoral Policy Reform Support. This was to assist GOL in implementing its
      Letter of Forest Management Policy and in developing the remaining regulations
      and instructions covering the principles for PSFM; establishment of the PFA and
      benefit-sharing and conflict resolution mechanisms. It would disseminate
      relevant laws and regulations and provide related training at all levels.
   b) Establishment of the PFA System. Work under this subcomponent would build on
      efforts to administratively define PFAs as part of the permanent National Forest
      Area. The main activities were to include finalizing methodologies, criteria and
      processes and developing related systems manuals, guidelines and procedures;
      preparing detailed implementation plans for identifying PFAs; staff training;
      demarcating and mapping of PFAs; program monitoring and preparation of a
      phased national program to bring production forest under sustainable forest
      management.
   c) Forest Management Guidelines and Procedures. This would help develop
      technical guidelines for planning, implementing and monitoring PSFM by
      developing a national Code of Forest management Practice, and helping introduce
      third party certification and enhancing awareness about chain of custody
      operations.
   d) Strengthening Sustainable Forest Management Capacity. This would support
      organizational development and capacity building of the National and Provincial
      Agricultural and Forestry Extension Services (NAFES/PAFES), Department of
      Forestry (DOF) at Provincial (PAFO) and District (DAFO) levels. It would also
      support development of a long-term training strategy.
Component 2: Sustainable Forest Management and Village Development (US$ 11.04
million, 67% of baseline cost). This component was to support implementation of
sustainable management practices in selected production forest areas, and improve
village livelihoods in the project area. It had two sub-components:

   a) Participatory    Sustainable Forest Management:             This would support
      implementation of sustainable management practices in production forest areas in
      the Central and Southern Provinces (see Map). It would provide training for
      Forest Management Unit staff and villagers in sustainable forest management
      planning and implementation covering timber, PTFP and biodiversity resource
      inventories; forest land-use zoning and preparation, implementation and
      monitoring of forest management and annual operation plans.
   b) Village Development. This would help villagers in project areas to plan,
      implement, monitor and evaluate their own development projects financed
      initially through the project, but later from revenues based on sustainable forest
      utilization. Main activities were revision of guidelines and procedures, training in
      village organization and development; creation and strengthening of village

                                           4
       forestry committees; village development planning and financial management,
       and development plans and projects. The subcomponent included a village
       development fund initially set at $8,000 per village, to fund village development
       investments. It also financed studies to increase the participation of women,
       ethnic minorities and the poor, and adopt the project methodology to their specific
       needs.
Component 3: Forest Sector Monitoring and Control (US$ 2.56 million, 16% of baseline
cost). This component was to cover four areas: (a) internal forest control, (b) forest law
enforcement monitoring and reporting (also referred to as external control), (c) forest
cover monitoring, and (d) independent monitoring and management audits. This
component would install the capacity for the forest administration to have current and
reliable data on key developments and trends in the sector. Goods and services to be
included were acquisition of computers, mapping facilities, satellite imagery, and
independent monitoring services.

Component 4: Project Management (US$ 1.86 million, 11% of baseline cost). This
component was to facilitate efficient project implementation and coordination with
various government agencies at central, provincial, and district levels. It would also
ensure effective collaboration and cooperation with relevant projects, donors and non-
governmental organizations.

1.6    Revised Components

11.     GOL requested Additional Financing (AF) to finance the geographic expansion of
the project over three more years. The Board approved an IDA Grant of SDR 6.8 million
(US$10 million) on December 18, 2008. The AF extended SUFORD coverage to eight
additional Production Forest Areas (PFAs) in five new project provinces, covering an
additional 1.3 million hectares (40% of all production forests). The Government of
Finland (GOF) also provided additional Technical Assistance (TA) of EUR 9 million
during the extension period. Additional activities were incorporated into the
implementation plan under appropriate components as follows:

Component 1: Support Services for Sustainable Forest Management (US$ 0.3 million), to
allow GOL to build on and expand the PSFM approach and refine the national forestry
sector policy and regulatory framework.

Component 2: Sustainable Forest Management and Village Development (US$ 7.5
million), to cover expanding field implementation and capacity building to five new
provinces and a limited number of selected PFAs.

Component 3: Forest Sector Monitoring and Control (US$ 0.7 million), to support new
activities for (a) the new Department of Forest Inspection (DoFI), Ministry of Agriculture
and Forestry (MAF) and for (b) extending forest cover monitoring and change detection
and, including forest biomass and carbon stock monitoring in support of Government’s
working group on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+).


                                            5
Component 4: Project Management (US$ 1.5 million), to support increased incremental
operating costs associated with expansion of the project area.

1.7    Other Significant Changes

12.    As noted above Additional Financing (AF) was requested to finance a three-year
extension and geographic expansion of the project.

13.      In response to a request from GoL, and following a mid-term review of the AF, an
additional one-year extension was granted, postponing the closing date to December 31,
2012. The additional year was necessary to provide more time to complete ongoing
activities, especially those related to ethnic community group activities following the
resettlement of a large number of Hmong who returned unexpectedly from Thailand to
Laos in December 2009. (See Key Factors in 2.2 below.)

2.     Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1    Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

14.    Soundness of the background analysis. The preparation of SUFORD was based
on detailed forestry sector research and analysis undertaken in partnership with the
Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and GOF (See Lao
PDR: Production Forest Policy, Status and Issues for Dialogue, June 11, 2001). This
provided a solid basis for understanding the broader dimensions of the policy and legal
framework of the forestry sector in Lao PDR, its contribution to poverty reduction and
economic growth, organizational and management issues, and sector monitoring
challenges.

15.      Lessons incorporated. The design of SUFORD built on lessons from the designs
of the Forest Management and Conservation Project (FOMACOP, closed FY2001), from
the Nam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project (approved in FY05 and ongoing) as well as
from related logging survey technical reports, and the previously mentioned joint
analytical work. Many lessons were drawn from FOMACOP such as: (a) government
policy framework and institutional arrangements need to be analyzed to fully understand
the implications of any proposed model development and to ensure willingness to reform;
(b) villagers must be involved in decision-making; (c) benefit-sharing arrangements must
be negotiated and agreed by all parties; (d) all parties must understand the nature of the
approved forest management plans and agreements to reduce conflict; and (e) compliance
monitoring programs that can neutrally evaluate performance should be established.
(SUFORD’s design incorporated specific lessons which are detailed in the PAD on pages
16-18).

16.     Project objectives. The project objectives were clearly articulated and well
aligned with the Borrower’s priorities and the CAS in effect at appraisal. The first project
development objective, relating to sustainable forest management with strong community
participation, focused on outcomes for which the operation could reasonably be held

                                             6
accountable given the project duration, resources, and approach. However, the second
objective relating to poverty alleviation was substantially broader and overly ambitious.
This second objective highlighting potential forest contributions to poverty alleviation
depended critically on efforts to achieve economic integration of target areas into the
national economy, and these efforts fell outside the scope and duration of the project. The
goal also depended on a more uniform distribution of timber across participating villages
than was encountered during implementation.

17.     Project components. The preliminary analytical work identified key sector
constraints elaborated in Section 1.1 above. These were addressed through specific
project investments and design elements, including mapping and demarcating PFAs;
expanding the scope of community involvement; supporting timely data collection;
improving forest management planning, introducing harvest levels in PFAs based on
annual allowable cut estimations and strengthening both internal and external controls.
The scale and geographic distribution of PFAs selected at appraisal were appropriate
considering the relatively large size of each production forest area, the total number of
anticipated beneficiaries (100,000) and the untested capacity of implementing agency
staff. Design for the use of village development funds had one key weakness. The village
development component stated that project funds would not be used to establish
revolving funds but left open the possibility of villagers creating such revolving or micro-
credit schemes and assumed that the necessary technical assistance and training would be
provided if required.

18.     Project institutional arrangements. The organizations chosen to play key roles
in project implementation were correctly identified, but the institutional arrangements
were complex and the number of organization involved exceeded the borrower’s
coordination capacity. The roles and responsibilities of the various actors could have
been further clarified as well. Furthermore, the project management unit was located in
an agency responsible for extension services, rather than mainstream forest management.
The project’s slow start-up can be attributed in part to limitations in the capacity of
project management, but the acceleration of implementation following the 2005 mid-term
review and a change in project leadership suggest that the design was correct if overly
ambitious.

19.    Substantial TA from Finland was established to support capacity building at both
national and subnational levels. This support was well aligned with the project objectives
and components and facilitated extensive capacity building, timely support for policy
making and provided key inputs to monitoring and evaluation during implementation.

20.     Government commitment and participatory processes. Early in project design
GoL committed to adopting policies to support village participation in forest
management. In December 2001, MAF agreed on the “main principles for village
participation? in the sustainable management of production forests. On May 22, 2002,
the Prime Minister’s Office issued Decree No. 59 on sustainable management of
production forests incorporating these principles. From the outset the project was
designed to support increased stakeholder involvement and to mainstream participatory

                                             7
processes in production forest management. FOMACOP had raised expectations that
were ultimately not fulfilled at the village level, so challenges inherent in participatory
approaches to forest management were understood and recognized by GoL.

21.     Assessment of Risks. The PAD assessed project risks as “substantial? which was
correct. The risks identified during project design were relevant and considerable. The
PAD classified the project as safeguards Category “A? based mainly on concerns related
to the sector’s disarray noted above and a recent history dominated by unsustainable
logging and associated negative impacts on local people who depended directly on forests
for subsistence (both as safety net and for expansion of rotational agriculture).

22.     The one risk rated “high? in the PAD focused on GoL’s continuing commitment
to sector reforms. This risk was mitigated both before and during implementation through
the establishment of a meaningful dialogue on forest policy based on sector work, policy
dialogue and a sustained engagement with GoL officials. Another risk was inadequate
consultation and participation with vulnerable groups, especially ethnic groups and
women. Risk mitigation measures outlined in the PAD were effective overall, though as
mentioned in Section 2.2 below there were a couple of important exceptions.

23.     Quality at Entry. Based on the analysis above, the ICR rates Quality at Entry as
moderately satisfactory. The PDO and design were well aligned with GOL policy and
with the CAS and the analytical research supporting the project was solid. Lessons from
previous and ongoing projects in the country and sector and from other forest projects
were thoroughly incorporated in the design. However, as noted above, and institutional
coordination challenges were underestimated and the risks and capacity issues were not
adequately identified. The Results Framework included weaknesses as detailed in
Section 2.3 below. The Bank’s Quality Assurance Group formally reviewed this project
as part of its sixth Quality at Entry Assessment cohort, and rated the project
“Satisfactory? both overall and in all its dimensions except for the risk assessment which
was rated “marginally satisfactory?.

2.2    Implementation

24.      SUFORD became effective in February 2004 but supervision reports consistently
pointed out slow project progress. A comprehensive mid-term review undertaken in
September 2005 led to important changes that included the appointment of a new project
director, simplification of government financial management and procurement
procedures, and improvements in annual planning and coordination between the central
government agencies and the provinces. These actions brought the project back on track
and the project rating was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in December 2005.
Ultimately the accelerated pace of implementation was sustained, and it eventually
supported the Bank’s decision to scale up the project with AF of SDR 6.8 million (US$10
million equivalent), approved on December 18, 2008. As mentioned in Section 1.7 above,
an additional one-year extension was approved to allow extra time to consolidate ongoing
activities to assist ethnic groups in Bolikhamxay Province.


                                            8
25.    A number of factors affected implementation as summarized below:

(a) Slow project start-up – Limited capacity and inter-departmental coordination
    challenges resulted in slow progress and low disbursements during the first two years
    of project implementation. This was reflected at national and sub-national levels
    including in financial management and procurement. A change in leadership and
    streamlined implementation procedures following the 2005 mid-term review led to
    improved project performance;

(b) Overlapping development activities – Given the large area covered by the project and
    the decentralized nature of land allocation decisions in Lao PDR, there were a number
    of overlaps between Production Forest Areas (PFAs) financed by the project and
    competing land uses. Identifying and addressing these overlaps consumed a
    significant amount of supervision time and resources. Details of two high profile
    cases are included in the next full paragraph below;

(c) Developing skills and experience for working with ethnic groups and women –
    Participatory approaches in forestry were introduced but the shift from a top-down
    command-and-control model to a more balanced collaborative approach was delayed
    as implementing agency staff acquired new skills and gained experience necessary to
    engage effectively with ethnic and female beneficiary groups. More information on
    efforts with ethnic minority groups is provided in section 2.4 below;

(d) Inter-agency coordination and partnerships – Efforts to develop smooth working
    relations among government departments and between government agencies and civil
    society organizations were only partially successful. The implementing agency’s
    ability to plan and coordinate field visits and deliver resources to partner
    organizations in a timely manner slowed implementation considerably.

(e) Poverty reduction – Poverty reduction impacts were lower than expected in part
    because harvestable timber resources were not uniformly available among
    communities. Grant support for village development partially offset these differences
    but future projects will need to focus on balancing sustainable livelihood alternatives
    from both forest and agricultural resources.

(f) Revolving funds – During the initial phase of implementation, most communities
    decided to use village development funds to establish revolving funds and to finance
    livelihood activities. However, there was limited capacity within the implementing
    agency at the time to support the effective management of these funds. Project reports
    also noted that repayment rates under these schemes were low. Ultimately it was
    decided that the AF would preclude establishment of new revolving funds (see
    Financing Agreement Schedule 2 Section 1, para 14 (d) (iv)).

(g) Technical assistance –TA financed by Finland throughout project implementation
    provided analytical rigor and crucial support for monitoring and evaluation. TA also
    helped to identify emerging issues, supported policy dialogue, and provided learning
    opportunities for senior government officials and key implementing agency staff both
                                            9
   within the Southeast Asia region and across regions with south-south exchanges with
   Africa and Latin America.

26.     Additional Financing. GoL’s commitment to sustainable forestry was evident in
decisions to significantly expand the number and area of designated PFAs and create a
dedicated Department of Forest Inspection. These decisions plus satisfactory
implementation provided the rationale for additional resources to geographically expand
SUFORD implementation and extend the implementation period for an additional three
years. This allowed GOL to build on and expand the PSFM approach and to further
develop and refine the national forestry sector policy and regulatory framework. To align
with a Ministerial guidance (September 2008), implementation and administrative
responsibilities for the project were transferred from the National Agriculture and
Forestry Extension Services (NAFES) to the DoF. DoF also housed the National Project
Management Office (NPMO) and experienced staff members previously involved in
project implementation were transferred to DoF.

27.    This change consolidated and concentrated overall project coordination and
implementation responsibilities under DoF and also helped to resolve earlier difficulties
stemming from the fact that responsibility for various aspects of forest policy formulation
and field implementation had been distributed across different agencies. A similar
consolidation was implemented at the provincial level where the Provincial Forestry
Service (PFS) took on responsibility for project implementation and coordination at the
provincial level. Under the new arrangement, DOF coordinated the inputs from all other
agencies, including NAFES, DOFI, Department of Inspection (DOI), National
Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute (NAFRI), and the Import and Export
Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MOIC). These agencies
continued to carry out implementation based on detailed annual work plans that were
developed under the coordination of the NPMO. Project implementation was carried out
under the guidance of a National Steering Committee (NSC) that included representatives
from all implementing agencies and project provinces. The geographic expansion of
SUFORD is detailed in the following table.

 Total                                              1,283.4

28.     A second mid-term review of project progress was undertaken jointly with
Finland in October 2010. This review generated several recommendations that included
detailed component by component guidance and preparation of a first Operational Risk
Assessment Framework for SUFORD. In addition the joint mission team discussed and
agreed with the implementing agency that the additional financing period should be seen
as a period to consolidate work undertaken during the first phase of SUFORD and to
develop the enabling environment for scaling up PSFM to the national level
(management planning capacity, field level skills acquisition, regulatory regime
particularly for timber sales, and timber benefit sharing incentives to ensure
sustainability). The joint mission placed strong emphasis on maintaining SUFORD’s high
quality standards for forest management planning and taking as much time as necessary
to develop a full understanding of PSFM at the village level, especially in areas
dominated by ethnic groups.

29.     Despite broad success, the project confronted a number of challenges. In Xekong
Province logging associated with hydro and mining developments went well beyond
approved areas and overlapped SUFORD financed areas; and in Bolikhamxay Province
nearly 3,000 of the Hmong refugees repatriated from Thailand in December 2009 were
resettled inside of the project-financed Phak Bueak PFA. The identification and
successful resolution of these cases was pursued actively through implementation support
missions, follow-up at the technical level, dialogue with other development partners and,
where appropriate, involved the Bank’s Country Management Unit (CMU) in direct
discussions with top GoL officials. Continuing implementation challenges included slow
development of DoF capacity to effectively engage with ethnic groups and women and
low levels of timber revenue. Major efforts were made recently to address these issues

                                           11
and the follow-on project, Scaling-up Participatory Sustainable Forest Management
(SUPSFM; approved May 31, 2013) will focus additional effort to improve engagement
and livelihoods.

2.3    Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

30.    M&E Design. The project design included appropriate indicators for monitoring
progress toward and achievement of the PDO although there were substantial differences
between indicators listed in the main text of the PAD and the project design summary
(PAD Annex 1). Efforts to update and improve SUFORD’s performance indicators were
made in the AF Project Paper (PP) as targets were updated/scaled-up and PAD
outcome/impact indicators were adopted as PDO indicators (see PP Annex4).
Nevertheless, some AF targets were still very qualitative and no Intermediate Outcome
Indicators (IOIs) were included in the revised Results Framework (RF). In retrofitting the
PAD Annex 1 (logframe) and revised RF from the PP into the datasheet of this ICR the
authors used PAD outcome/impact indicators (as revised in the PP) as IOI as these were
deemed to best demonstrate achievement of the PDO (see also Section 1.3). (Note:
Section F in the datasheet does not fully reflect the Results Framework in the PP due to
system constraints.)

31.     M&E Implementation. Appropriate data collection and analysis were undertaken.
Project level monitoring and evaluation were the responsibility of the National Project
Management Office (NPMO) with support from the Finnish TA team. NPMO provided
regular quarterly updates on project activities and deliveries against an agreed work plan
and timeline for completion. The Implementing Agency pursued an opportunity to
implement a rapid assessment of forest cover change in an area where harvesting had
been authorized to facilitate hydro and mining developments. This assessment provided
an innovative and cost effective way to evaluate the impacts of development activities on
project PFAs and adjoining forests (see also Sections 5.1 and 6.4). One gap in the M&E
implementation was the lack of baseline information to measure project impacts on
forest-based income and food security at household level.

32.      M&E Utilization. M&E produced several impact assessments and case studies
that contributed directly to improved project performance. Project studies were used to
evaluate and refine project approach and strategy, e.g. increasing the focus on ethnic
group engagement and strengthening outreach to women but this came only during the
later stages of project implementation. Forest sector monitoring and data collection have
improved substantially; however more training on information systems is needed at sub-
national level.

2.4    Safeguards and Fiduciary Compliance

33.    Environment and Social Safeguards. Specific attention was given to
environmental and social safeguard aspects during preparation and implementation.
SUFORD was rightly designated as a Category “A? project and triggered five Bank
safeguard policies on Environmental Assessment, Natural Habitats, Forests, Indigenous


                                           12
Peoples and Involuntary Resettlement. To comply with these policies, an Environmental
Assessment was conducted and publicly disclosed through the Bank’s Infoshop and in
Vientiane in the local language on March 20, 2003. A Resettlement Policy Framework
and an Ethnic Group Development Plan were also developed and disclosed. In
preparation for the AF, an updated Environmental Impact Assessment and Social Impact
Assessment were completed as well an Ethnic Group Participation Strategy and Gender
Mainstreaming Strategy. No additional safeguards were triggered. No resettlement
occurred during the entire life of the project. In addition, appropriate institutional
arrangements through training, orientation and capacity building were developed to
ensure ethnic groups in the project areas would receive timely and clear information
about project activities.

34.     Following approval of the AF, greater emphasis was placed on strengthening
extension services to ethnic group communities, women and poor households through
additional staff, ethnic group advisors, and building partnerships. To evaluate the success
of these efforts, a Social Safeguards Assessment was undertaken by the Bank covering
both indigenous people and involuntary resettlement (August 2012). This assessment did
not find any examples of material harm or forced resettlement; however the assessment
identified continuing weaknesses in the project’s consultations with ethnic communities
and women in the study area of 14 villages. The assessment made several
recommendations as follows. At the project design stage, the assessment recommended
mainstreaming safeguards in project design, building adequate capacity to meet
safeguards requirements, and, creating mechanisms for mediation and dispute resolution.
To engage ethnic communities the assessment recommended: (i) adopting indicators to
evaluate the quality of the consultation process; (ii) offering separate forums for women;
(iii) providing more time for ethnic communities to discuss and understand project
objectives/alternatives; and (iv) utilizing more culturally appropriate tools and methods
for information sharing. Introducing new ways to strengthen land and resource tenure and
improve on participatory land use planning were also recommended. The assessment
further recommended that future projects incorporate diverse incentives from timber,
NTFPs, and payment for environmental services, including carbon.

35.     Numerous challenges remained at the time of project closure with regard to
inadequate capacity, especially at the sub-national level, mechanisms to efficiently
transfer funds from the center to the provinces, and interagency coordination problems.
As previously noted DoF capacity to effectively engage with ethnic groups and women
remained low, and despite improve guidelines and capacity building efforts, this aspect
and compliance with the Indigenous People’s safeguard was rated moderately
unsatisfactory at closing. Addressing this gap will require continued efforts consistent
with the recommendations detailed in the previous paragraph. These recommendations
have already been incorporated into the design of the follow-on SUPSFM project.

36.    External risks arising from issuance of a salvage-logging contract in Xekong
Province, and the resettlement of Hmong returnees in Bolikhamxay Province, were
addressed through timely risk management and supervision. Neither the salvage logging
nor the resettlement of Hmong refugees was a result of the project, and neither was

                                            13
considered a breach of applicable safeguard policies. Nevertheless the potential impact
was promptly assessed and addressed with support from the CMU. The Task Team
adopted a ‘proactive’ approach to safeguard management, and engaged actively with the
Implementing Agency, provincial authorities and other Development Partners to identify
and address the needs of the resettled Hmong. In the case of salvage logging the risk of
potential non-compliance with the financing agreement was raised by the Task Team
with GoL but a mutually agreed solution was reached with the issuance of a letter from
the Prime Minister’s Office providing the necessary assurances and seeking continued
collaboration between the Bank and GoL to improve the performance of salvage logging.

37.     Procurement. Procurement capacity and associated risks were assessed during
both project phases and rated substantial after mitigation measures. These measures
included engagement of a qualified international procurement consultant for the Project
Management Unit to work with the national procurement staff to implement the
Procurement Plan and develop an agreed action plan for strengthening transparency and
accountability in procurement. Procurement had been rated satisfactory in complying
with Bank guidelines, but was downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in 2010 as
procurement fell behind schedule. The AF mid-term review in 2010 found a number of
issues with project procurement and made recommendations to improve procurement
performance related to strengthening transparency and accountability, improving the
procurement plan and reducing delays in procurement. Adequate systems were in place
for effective procurement although sub-national procurement continues to be a challenge.
At closing, procurement was still rated moderately satisfactory due to weaknesses in
planning procurement, assessing the quality of and adhering to the procurement plan, and
contract administration.

38.     Financial Management. The financial management capacity at the central and
provincial level was duly assessed. Fiduciary risks were rated substantial after mitigation
due to the overall weak control environment in the country and low capacity, particularly
at the provincial level. During the AF, the same financial management and disbursement
arrangements were maintained. Staff in the Finance Management unit had developed
good capacity during implementation which was transferred to DoF, and this ensured
continuity in both financial management and procurement. In addition, detailed capacity
building, supervision, and controls were implemented during the AF period. In addition,
integrated procurement and financial management supervision was introduced which
provided regular feedback and identified areas for improvement. During the AF, FM
performance was rated moderately satisfactory due to delays in advances clearing, the
fixed asset register not being up to date, etc. Audits were conducted and submitted to the
Bank on schedule and received unqualified results; IFRs were of acceptable quality and
were submitted on time.

2.5    Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

39.    GoF has extended its TA through September 30, 2013 and a formal request for
continued GoL budget support has been prepared and submitted. GoL has finalized its
REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal (R-PP) and is expected to receive a US$ 3.6


                                            14
million grant from the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) shortly. Lao PDR
identified three eligible Forest Investment Program (FIP) projects and received
preparation grants in 2012 (totaling US$ 1.3 million). GoL is working closely with the
Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) to
prepare FIP operations and all three projects are expected to become operational in FY14.
The follow-on SUPSFM project, approved by the FIP steering committee (March 2013)
and the Board (May 2013), expands implementation of PSFM into Northern Laos and
helps to address previous gaps, including strengthening livelihood opportunities and
improving engagement with ethnic groups and women. Substantial Finnish TA support
was jointly developed and appraised and is expected to be available throughout the
implementation period. In addition, preparations are being made to mobilize funding
(US$4.5 million) from the FIP Dedicated Grant Mechanism (DGM) to support
community engagement and involvement of ethnic groups and a proposed IDA-financed
Natural Resources and Environmental Management Project is being prepared with the
Ministry of National Resources and Environment (MONRE) as the implementing agency.
All PFAs are expected to have management plans by 2015. GoL plans to utilize its own
financial resources to support management plan preparation in Phongsaly, Houaphan and
Xiangkhuang Provinces and the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is
expected to provide support for drawing up management plans for PFAs in Luang
Prabang Province.

3.     Assessment of Outcomes

3.1    Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: High

40.     Over its 10-year life, SUFORD’s objectives were strongly linked to the Bank’s
assistance strategies. The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS, Report 19098-LA) in effect
at appraisal in 2003 focused on poverty reduction, and had two pillars directly supported
by SUFORD: (a) deepening structural reforms, part of which was reforming the
regulatory environment for the private sector and other sectors such as agriculture and
forestry through capacity building; and (b) investing in rural development and natural
resource management, by ensuring appropriate forestry management techniques for
environmental sustainability.

41.     When the AF was approved in 2008, SUFORD’s objectives remained well
aligned with the CAS of 2005 (Report 31758-LA). Specifically, CAS objective 1 was to
sustain growth through improved management of key drivers, notably rural development
and natural resource management. SUFORD contributed toward improving governance
and environmental management of natural assets; strengthening the collection and use of
revenues from natural resources to help reduce poverty; maintaining productive forest
cover as part of rural livelihoods, reducing the deforestation rate and improving rural
livelihoods (CAS, p 22). SUFORD contributed, to a lesser extent, to CAS objective 2 by
strengthening public financial management for ensuring that public resources would be



                                           15
efficiently and transparently managed so that increased natural resource revenues would
be channeled to poverty-reducing services (CAS, p. 26).

42.     Upon completion in December 2012, it remained highly relevant to the new
Country Partnership Strategy (Report 66692-LA), whose second strategic objective was
sustainable natural resource management, particularly outcome 2.3 “Sustainable
management and protection of forests and biodiversity? (p. 27). The DoF would continue
to develop and expand its program of independent certification through the Forest
Stewardship Council and its engagement in Global Climate Change adaptation and
mitigation efforts through the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and Forest Investment
Program.

43.     The project also remained consistent with GOL strategy. In its Seventh National
Socio-Economic Development Plan (2011-15), GOL signaled its intentions to attract
significant foreign direct investment and to increase forest cover from 40% in 2010 to
70% by 2020. On May 31, 2013, the Bank approved SUFORD’s follow-on project,
“Scaling up Participatory Sustainable Forest Management Project?, which demonstrates
GOL’s continued strong commitment to sustainable management of the sector and the
importance it places on participatory forest management.

3.2    Achievement of Project Development Objectives (PDOs)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

44.     The PDO was to assist the Borrower to achieve the sustainable management of
production forests to alleviate rural poverty in the Project Provinces by implementing the
forest policy reform actions and policies set forth in its Letter of Forest Management
Policy. The analysis of the ICR focuses on two key elements of the PDO: (i) achieving
sustainable forest management; and (ii) project contributions toward poverty alleviation
as measured by the available baseline data and project monitoring indicators.

3.2.1 Sustainable Management of Production Forests (Rating: Satisfactory)

45.     Policy, legal and incentive framework enables expansion of PSFM. The forestry
sector, and more broadly the natural resource sector, has seen significant policy and legal
framework improvements to which the project has made both direct and indirect
contributions. The PSFM approach introduced by SUFORD has been adopted nationally,
attracting financial support from other Development Partners (JICA and FIP) and GoL
with implementation in all PFAs expected by 2015. A Presidential Decree (2012) drafted
with project support substantially increased timber revenue-sharing (12% of gross
revenue) with all communities in PFAs and reinvestment in forest management at local
level. Before the project communities had zero entitlement to timber revenue.

46.     Priority natural production forests are brought under PSFM. Key targets for
this objective relate to: (i) area under sustainable management, (ii) quality and
completeness of operational plans, and (iii) an expanding area of forest under
certification. SUFORD brought 1.3 million ha (about 40% of the total area) under

                                            16
sustainable forest management and all project PFAs have approved management plans.
Management plans no longer focus narrowly on timber extraction but include co-benefits
such as improved biodiversity and wildlife conservation values. High Conservation Value
Forest (HCVF) areas have been identified and excluded from harvest areas. It is still too
soon to measure the impact of co-benefit inclusion on abundance of wildlife but studies
elsewhere have demonstrated the positive impacts. Independent Forest Certification has
been introduced to Lao PDR with the support of SUFORD. The total area under
certification is 3,378 km2, of which the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) forest
management standard is applied in 806 km2, and the FSC controlled wood standard is
applied in 2,572 km2.

47.     Sector monitoring and control system functioning. Key targets for this objective
included: (i) reduction in illegal land conversions and logging operations, ii) forest cover
change detection piloted, iii) integrated forest inventory and cover monitoring and data
management system developed, (iv) internal control system completed, (v) forest law
enforcement program developed and implemented, and vi) maintenance and expansion of
independent certification of forest under PSFM. A new Department of Forest Inspection
(DoFI) was established in 2008. DoFI received targeted support under SUFORD AF (for
vehicles and equipment) and a Japanese PHRD grant (US$ 0.5 million) and has built
significant capacity for forest law enforcement. A Forest Law Enforcement Strategy 2020
was developed with project financing and formally approved (2013).

48.    Forest resources in project areas have been better protected through the
declaration of PFAs, boundary demarcation and local public display of forest maps. DoF
and DoFI gained the tools and capacity to manage risks from concessions and minimize
unauthorized logging in PFAs. As noted in Section 2.2, despite broad success in forest
law enforcement, notable exceptions occurred on two occasions in Xekong and
Bolikhamxay Provinces.

49.      There was a demonstrated decrease in the rate of deforestation in seven SUFORD
financed PFAs compared to outside areas (SUFORD 2012). Deforestation in PFAs is
concentrated in degraded forests with limited growing stock. Deforestation in high
potential commercial production forests with high canopy cover has declined. Declines
are attributed to project-developed PFA rules banning forest conversion and concessions,
and formulation of forest management plans that zone forest uses and limit harvest levels.

3.2.2 Alleviate Rural Poverty (Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory)

50.     Villagers’ well-being and livelihoods improved through benefits from
sustainable forestry and community development efforts. Key targets were: (i) increased
availability of subsistence and economic NTFPs and wildlife resources, (ii) broad-based
participation and equitable sharing of benefits, (iii) increased participation of women,
ethnic minorities, and poor households in forest management activities, including paid
labor, and in leadership roles in VFOs, and (iv) increased number of village forestry
committees established and functioning. Overall the project achieved considerable results
in broadening the base of participation among communities with important, though


                                            17
partial, increases in participation among women and ethnic groups. Over 700 VFO and
committees, and 49 group village forestry committees were established. The PSFM
system developed under SUFORD is poised to make a sustained contribution to local
livelihoods through implementation of the decree on timber revenue sharing.

51.     The total disbursement for village development grants was US$ 4.6 million of
which US$ 3.4 million was distributed in the original project provinces and US$ 1.2
million in the AF provinces. The timber revenue received by communities by end 2011
was estimated at US$150,000. A time series study was undertaken to assess the impact of
village development grants in the original provinces with a baseline in 2009 and a follow
up in 2012. In many communities village development grant proceeds were converted to
revolving funds and distributed in the form of small loans with low interest targeted to
the poorest community members. In 2009, the proportion of poor households was almost
the same among households that received or did not receive a loan, 29% and 28%
respectively. In 2012, it was found that among those households that had not received
loans, the proportion of poor households had dropped to 14%. Among those who had
received loans, the proportion of poor households had dropped to 9% suggesting that
poverty reduction accelerated among loan recipients.

52.     Measured against the key indicators the outcomes of this sub-component are
judged to be moderately unsatisfactory given that the impacts in terms of household
income and ethnic group engagement and participation were less than expected and
important lessons for future design and outcome monitoring must be highlighted. Despite
the substantial improvements outlined above, anticipated revenue flowing from timber
harvests to participating communities has not yet materialized. This gap is due to the
relatively low stocking levels in PFAs, the conservative harvest levels and the uneven
distribution of timber across communities. Project data indicate that only 44% of targeted
communities in PFA areas were able to receive revenue from harvested timber during the
implementation period as against a target of 60%. NTFPs provide sustainable forest
based income but significant additional efforts are needed to support the identification
and implementation of livelihoods from forestry resources. This will require inter-
disciplinary and inter-institutional efforts over a sustained period.

3.3    Efficiency

53.     The efficiency of the project, including “value for money? is rated moderately
satisfactory recognizing that project costs were reasonable in terms of the benefits
generated and outcomes achieved when compared to other forest sector operations both
in terms of cost per unit area brought under management plans and number of
beneficiaries involved. Incremental operating costs were higher than anticipated but these
costs were largely related to mobilizing project staff to meet directly with local
beneficiaries in remote field sites and should be considered as supplemental to project
training and capacity building costs. Both the Departments of Forestry and of Forest
Inspection have been able to increase their efficiency and cost effectiveness by adopting
and institutionalizing the use of modern management tools, including internal monitoring
and control systems and remote sensing for assessment of forest cover changes. Some


                                           18
inefficiency and delays resulted from the realignment of responsibilities following the
establishment of the new Ministry for Natural Resources and Environment. Efficiency
can be restored through cooperation/coordination agreements, prompt hiring to fill skills
gaps and by improving recruitment and employment conditions. Detailed economic
analysis of project costs and benefits is presented in Annex 3: Economic and Financial
Analysis.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

54.     Based on: (a) Relevance - High; (b) Project Development Objective achievement
– Moderately Satisfactory; and (c) Efficiency – Moderately Satisfactory, the project’s
overall outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory due to weaknesses in achievements in
poverty alleviation (detailed in section 3.2.2 above).

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

55.     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development. The project has
contributed to poverty reduction in two key ways – distribution of village development
grants and sharing timber revenue with village communities. Section 3.2 provides an
assessment of the PDO related to poverty alleviation. Data for the AF provinces indicates
that the proportion of poor households represent 44% of total households. Information
from the first quarter of 2010-2011 indicates that women’s share of the work input and
wages was 11% and ethnic minority groups received 37%. The share of women remains
low but ethnic minority groups have benefitted in proportion to their number in the total
population covered by the project. Revenue from timber sales has been utilized mainly
for public investments such as roads, bridges, village halls, that benefit the community.

56.     Institutional Change/Strengthening. A key outcome of the project from 2003-
2012 was strengthening of the capacity of the DOF and the DoFI. The project has also
helped DoF develop a set of comprehensive guidelines for PSFM and use of the village
development grants, including guidelines for working with ethnic groups. An impressive
number of training courses have been delivered -- 7000 training days for staff -- and this
has helped newly introduced approaches find their way into practice. Studies conducted
on the performance of government staff show that skills have improved, especially in
land use planning, and village development planning although financial skills still need
further improvement especially at the sub-national level. SUFORD also assisted in
developing a set of management tools, including a national forestry reporting system,
internal monitoring system, document management system, budget planning system, and
budget monitoring system. The implementation of these systems is under way but
mainstreaming their use requires further training which will be delivered under the
follow-on project.

4.     Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

57.    The risk to Development Outcomes is rated Significant based on the risks below:



                                           19
(a) There is likelihood of negative impacts to sustainable forest management in
production forest areas through development of activities such as hydropower, mining,
salvage logging, and concessions. Efforts to strengthen forest sector monitoring and
forest law enforcement and governance could become weaker in deference to rent
seeking unauthorized logging and land conversions outside authorized areas. Forest cover
change detection and monitoring may not receive the requisite institutional commitment
and financial resources. Rating: Moderate.

(b) SUFORD has made an important contribution to help create an enabling environment
for Participatory Sustainable Forest Management at the national and sub-national levels.
This is by no means a task that is complete, especially in the context of the understanding
that state control over management of forests in South East Asia is still dominant. There
is a possibility that the forestry sector institutions may restrict the space for participatory
forest management, which has been created by SUFORD, as also by other donor and
development partners in Lao PDR. Rating: Moderate.

(c) Considerable project resources have been invested in capacity building in
participatory forest management, technical forest management, and social and
institutional methodologies and skills. In the absence of continued development
investment, the GoL may not be able to provide finances to continue to strengthen these
elements. Mainstreaming and institutionalization of many of these practices and
innovations still need time and investment. This could lead to demotivation, loss of skills
and attrition that would have a negative impact on already limited capacity within the
forestry sector in Lao PDR. Rating: Significant.

(d) Climate change presents an unmitigated and unquantifiable risk to the development
outcome of this project. Multiple climate related threats including drought, flood, forest
fire, and insect and disease prevalence may all impact sustainable forest management in
Lao PDR. Rating: Uncertain.

5.     Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

58.     (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory. The Bank’s preparation team was well rounded with a very senior forestry
expert as task team leader, and with specialists in procurement, FM, and safeguards
specialists. Together with GOF, SIDA, and the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO), the Bank team did substantial analytical work which correctly identified the
issues and constraints in the country’s forestry sector. The team designed a project
whose core objectives and approach responded well to those issues, which was well
aligned with GOL’s strategy and the Bank’s CAS, and which incorporated lessons
learned from past interventions. The project’s geographical scope was rightly limited to
four contiguous provinces in southern Laos rather than having scattered locations around
the country. The team assisted the borrower to gain access to project preparation funding
from the Japanese Government with a PHRD Grant to prepare a detailed plan for


                                              20
developing and implementing community-based forestry management and for preparing a
detailed assessment of the legal and institutional framework for community-based
sustainable forest management. The Bank team provided guidance on the preparation of
the necessary safeguards documentation. Project preparation from the concept review to
approval lasted 16 months, at a cost of approximately $367,000.

59.     However, there were some shortcomings related to assessing capacity of the
implementing agency, and broader stakeholder capacity weaknesses. Inadequate capacity
led to an extremely slow start to the project, and delays in establishing satisfactory
management, financial and administrative mechanisms. Appropriate assessment of
capacity needs and subsequent adjustments in the project design would have reduced
delays in project start-up. As mentioned in Section 2.3, the results framework would
have been more rigorous if indicators on poverty alleviation had been included. The risk
assessment of Substantial was correct, but risks related to ethnic minorities and women
could have been more realistic. The Bank’s Quality Assurance Group assessed the project
as Satisfactory overall and in all its dimensions, except for the risk assessment which was
rated marginally satisfactory. They expressed concern about upcoming country and sector
management changes, and possibility that the incoming management team might
underestimate the project’s riskiness and not sufficiently support the team.

60.     (b) Quality of Supervision; Rating: Satisfactory. Supervision throughout the
project period was satisfactory and highly responsive to project needs. Supervision in the
first two years was difficult due to implementation delays, as the implementing agencies
struggled with weak capacity especially in procurement and FM and coordination at the
different levels – national, provincial, district. The Bank rightly downgraded the project
to unsatisfactory in December 2004. The Bank supervision team identified the weakest
points as being related to project management, inter-institutional coordination and
inefficiencies in fund flows However, significant issues were resolved as a result of
changes made during the mid-term review in September 2005 and the project ratings
were upgraded to moderately satisfactory by December 2005. Supervision thereafter
remained consistent and provided timely technical advice to the borrower. During the last
three years of the project, Bank supervision was alert, responsive and, in close
coordination with the CMU, addressed external threats to the PDO. These have included
issuance of a salvage-logging contract in Xekong Province, and the resettlement of
Hmong returnees in Bolikhamxay Province. (Team supervision inputs for safeguards and
fiduciary issues is further elaborated in Section 2.2.)

61.    (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance Rating: Moderately
Satisfactory. The Bank overstated the PDO somewhat by including poverty alleviation,
an aspect that was not fully under the control of the project. Furthermore the Bank did
not provide monitoring indicators to measure progress toward poverty alleviation, and in
the end, this contributed to the overall moderately satisfactory project outcome rating.
The Bank also overestimated the capacity of the implementing agencies at appraisal, but
the resulting start-up delays were resolved through the mid-term review in 2005.
Thereafter the project achieved most of its annual objectives as per plan and budget. The
project supervision team allowed for substantial improvements in implementation
modalities and recognized the borrower’s commitment and improved capacity to scale up
                                            21
the project and processed AF in late 2008. Along with normative supervision, the Bank
also used other tools to remain vigilant, and to take early steps to manage and mitigate
likely negative impacts to safeguard project objectives.

5.2       Borrower Performance

62.     Government Performance; Rating: Moderately Satisfactory. GoL provided the
necessary support including adequate and timely provision of counterpart funding. GOL
provided the project with appropriate staff and the National Steering Committee
performed its duties with efficiency. Contract processing and financial audits were
carried out without any undue delays. Coordination mechanisms between the MoF and
MAF were effective in project management. Changes in the supporting legal and
regulatory frameworks and policies were implemented despite differing views and
incentives among the responsible agencies. GoL ensured compliance with the legal
agreements and addressed concerns in a timely manner when issues were raised. During
project implementation GoL identified and decreed the formal expansion of Production
Forest Areas on two occasions. Decree 29 in 2006 and Decree 270 in 2008 increased total
PFA area from an initial 656,000 ha to 2.5 million ha and eventually to 3.1 million ha.
While the approval of the Decree for PFAs was timely, there were delays in policy
guidance due mainly to the inter-ministerial and inter-agency involvement of multiple
agencies.

63.    Implementing Agency Performance; Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.
Implementing Agency (Department of Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry)
performance is rated moderately satisfactory based on the following:

         DoF was able to address key weaknesses identified in the first mid-term review
          by introducing significant management and procedural changes;
          NPMO maintained an open and frank dialogue with the Task Team and Finnish
          TA team with respect to implementation challenges throughout the project and
          this facilitated identification of problems, discussion of proposed solutions and
          fostered an iterative learning process;
         NPMO was also highly persistent in pursuing the resolution of difficult issues
          through internal and external policy and procedural debates (Hmong resettlement
          and salvage logging are just two examples); and
         DoF played a key role in ensuring that development activity overlaps with PFAs
          were avoided, minimized and mitigated. Overlapping concessions were requested
          on numerous occasions but these requests were routinely rejected if they were not
          compatible with PFA management objectives and the PDO.

64.     Despite active and frequent (during AF) supervision inputs, substantial technical
assistance from Finland, and flexible programming, the Implementing Agency was still
grappling with a number of weaknesses at the end of the project including:

         Coordination with partner agencies both in terms of joint planning and timely
          transfer of financial resources remains as an area for further improvement; and

                                             22
        Despite significant investments in financial management and procurement
         capacity and systems there was only modest improvement in the performance of
         these functions at sub-national levels.

65.   Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance; Rating:
Moderately Satisfactory. Government and Implementing Agency performances were
rated Moderately Satisfactory as was the overall project rating. Therefore overall
borrower performance is also rated Moderately Satisfactory.

6.       Lessons Learned

66.      SUFORD was successful in achieving considerable results in a challenging
institutional and dynamic external environment and contributed significantly to
sustainable management of the forestry resources of Lao PDR. Many lessons have been
generated for future investments.

67.      Institutional Arrangements. One of the key challenges in the original phase of
the project was the institutional arrangements did little to clarify the roles and
responsibilities of the organizations involved. The project management unit was located
in an agency responsible for extension services, rather than mainstream forest
management. This was duly addressed through the mid-term review in 2010 which
redesigned the institutional framework and moved project management responsibility to
the Department of Forests. This brought project management and extension under one
institutional umbrella, improved decision-making, reporting, accountability, and
implementation.

68.     Capacity Assessment. While significant investments and improvements have been
made in strengthening capacity of the implementing agency, the importance of accurately
assessing capacity during appraisal cannot be overstated. Overestimation of capacity led
to establishing project targets that were beyond the capacity of the implementing agency
and led to significant delays in project start-up. Overall, the project has been successful in
enhancing capacity but it could also have addressed broader institutional capacity
requirements, and developed a strategy to meet them within and beyond the project.

69.     Community Development Challenges. The complexity of social dynamics and
community development was also underestimated, and the diversity of ethnic groups,
resource practices, and languages compounded these challenges. These were partially
addressed through improved staffing, supervision, and recommendations. However, given
the inadequate capacity of the implementing agency in social and institutional aspects,
many of these recommendations could not be fully implemented during the life of the
project. This problem is not specific to the project, but has been an issue for forestry
projects and institutions and requires a long-term commitment to analysis, resources, and
iterative learning.

70.    Finance and Procurement Arrangements. Although the implementing agency
had prior experience of Bank financing and procurement compliance requirements,

                                             23
establishing the required arrangements took longer than anticipated. The project took
steps to strengthen capacity by placing financial management and procurement
consultants, and by offering training programs to implementing agency staff. A key
lesson for the project was the importance of assessing fiduciary and procurement
protocols, capacity for compliance and take early steps to mitigate delays.

71.     Inclusive Principles and Practice. The project adopted an inclusive approach and
prioritized ethnic group communities, but translating these principles into practice
remained a challenge. For future projects an important lesson is to ensure that social,
equity and community issues are mainstreamed in design, adequate capacity is created
through training, orientation and partnerships, and equity issues are monitored through
the project cycle. Many positive lessons were also learned from attempts to address
gender issues. These have included the importance of having dedicated female staff, and
an advisor, partnerships with organizations with extension skills and experience of
working with women. In future projects, further analysis is required on barriers to
women’s participation, mainstreaming gender issues prominently in project design,
integrating women-specific perspectives in forest management plans, improving training
of staff, and including processes which enable appropriate outreach to women. In
addition, monitoring methods need to be refined, including gender budgeting and social
audits.

72.     Independent PSFM Monitoring. The project introduced the concept of rapid
surveys conducted by professionals both outside and inside line organizations to focus on
selected activities. The objective was to provide implementing agencies with timely
feedback so that corrective action can be taken while the work was ongoing. This has
been a useful tool for DoF managers and needs to be developed and expanded further.

7.     Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partner

73.    No additional comments were received from the borrower/implementing agency
on the draft ICRR. The views of the borrower on the SUFORD project are summarized
in Annex 6.

                           Annex 2. Outputs by Components


1.     SUFORD had four components. In this Annex outputs by component are
reviewed against those identified in the PAD and PP.

Component 1: Support Services for Sustainable Forest Management

2.       Under component 1 expected outputs included:

        Sectoral Policy Reform Support
        Establishment of the Permanent National Production Forest Area
        Forest Management Guidelines and Procedures
        Strengthening Sustainable Forest Management Capacity

3.      The project paper revised the expected targets under component 1 and included
delivery of the following; Annual Government consultations at central and provincial
levels determine the conduct of logging and timber sales business in Lao PDR on the
basis of sustainable yields as determined in PFA management planning replacing quota
system; Policy dialogue on support program for development of a permanent Protection
Forest System, including methodologies, criteria and procedures and mapping,
developed; and Inter-ministerial agreements (MAF, MOF, PMO, MOIC) on procedures
for transparent, competitive log sales and wood pricing and fair benefit sharing and
transfer systems finalized and applied in all project provinces.

4.      Sectoral Policy Reform Support. Support was provided throughout project
implementation and Finnish TA financed many elements of the support for forest sector
policy reform. The items highlighted below represent only a sample of key outputs.

5.      Forestry conferences were held annually and resulted in concrete
recommendations that created a sound basis for improving the policy and legal
framework and enhancing the effectiveness of forest operations in the sector.
Recommendations from the conferences were often though not always adopted promptly
as Presidential Decrees.

6.      With support from SUFORD a drafting committee was formed under DOF that
included members from the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce. The joint
committee prepared draft legislation for timber revenue benefit sharing. The Prime
Minister approved a Decree on timber revenue benefit sharing in January 2012. A key
element of the new legislation transfers 70% of timber revenue to the Treasury and
divides the remaining 30% among other stakeholders/activities, including 12% for
communities. The new system makes additional funds available for village development
and for implementing PSFM. Although the revised benefit sharing mechanism was
endorsed it has not been applied because no quota was approved in the final two years of
project implementation.
                                           26
7.      The timber industry-restructuring program developed criteria for evaluating the
ability of individual forest enterprises to add value and export finished and semi-finished
wood products. The criteria were used to determine the eligibility of individual
enterprises to participate in timber auctions and secure raw material. More recently there
has been a focus on promoting the establishment of Chain of Custody systems (CoC) in
wood processing enterprises.

8.      Several analyses related to timber sales were conducted and MoIC revised the
timber sales guidelines based on the proposed recommendations. Analysis of quota
distribution in the previous years was initiated. A preliminary analysis on the present and
potential contribution of wood industries, REDD+, and PFA management and NTFP
collection were carried out.

9.      SUFORD supported GoL preparation and piloting of a payment mechanism to
compensate communities for watershed protection services. A technical report on
payments for forest ecosystem services, specifically forest carbon/REDD+, biodiversity
offsets, watershed payments and eco-tourism was prepared.

10.     The project supported DOF participation within the UNFCCC REDD+
negotiations by preparing policy briefs, drafting national positions and providing
briefings for various stakeholders. SUFORD advisors provided support to the national
REDD Task Force, especially with respect to developing the R-PP, Conference of Parties
negotiator training and holding seminars for capacity building on REDD. Several
preliminary market studies for forest carbon offsets (including REDD+), along with
policy reports to support the development of a national REDD+ position within the
UNFCCC negotiating process were undertaken.

11.     Establishment of the Permanent National Production Forest Area. The Prime
Minister’s Office issued a decree establishing the framework for management of
Protection Forests. SUFORD supported a study to examine management issues and to
propose zonation criteria to assist in selection and zonation of the Protection Forest
Areas.

12.    During project implementation, GoL identified and decreed the formal expansion
of Production Forest Areas on two occasions. Decree 29 in 2006 and Decree 270 in 2008
increased total PFA area from an initial 656,000 ha to 2.5 M ha and eventually to 3.1 M
ha.

13.     In 2009, DOF transferred the responsibility for monitoring related to PFAs and
forest certification from the Planning Division to the Production Forestry and Forest
Business Management Division.

14.     Forest Management Guidelines and Procedures. An extensive set of forest
management guidelines and procedures were prepared during SUFORD (see Annex 8:
List of Supporting Documents). Selected key outputs are listed below.

                                            27
15.    Reduced Impact Logging regulations were approved under the Code of Practice
for Harvesting in Production Forest Areas.

16.     Revision to the Permanent Sample Plots (PSP) guideline manual for data
collection and establishment was completed with training at central and provincial level
being conducted in all provinces.

17.     Two studies were undertaken on Habitat Classification and Management Models;
the findings suggest current management methods are adequate.

18.    Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) and SUFORD collaborated to produce a
booklet promoting Laos FSC timbers and NTFP species (Rattan).

19.    Strengthening Sustainable Forest Management Capacity.

20.     SUFORD supported participation of staff from MAF and MoIC in the ASEAN
forest certification process as required. The Department of Forestry and the Department
of Import and Export (DIMEX) participated in the ASEAN process, which is supporting
the development of internal and external monitoring systems for forestry in Lao PDR.A
complementary grant of US$500,000 became available from the Japan Policy and Human
Resource Development (PHRD) Grant facility under the World Bank.

21.     The project assisted a number of domestic wood processing manufacturers in
developing and adopting Chain of Custody (CoC) in their operations. The process of
connecting these factories with other Global Forest and Trade Network (GFTN) members
in the region is now in progress. A marketing booklet on Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC) timber and non-timber forest products is being finalized and published.

22.     Several studies related to management models were conducted, including a rapid
review of the role of Traditional Ecological Knowledge in forest management, a study on
dry forest management options, an initial biodiversity assessment, an initial review of
forest restoration strategies. The findings were incorporated in relevant guidelines.

23.    A review of planned or proposed development activities that overlapped the
SUFORD PFAs was prepared and updated periodically during the AF phase. This
provided an opportunity to identify and discuss any upcoming development activities
with a potential to disrupt or delay project implementation. Given the large footprint of
SUFORD it was understood that some overlapping activities would occur and some of
these might require selected areas to be excluded from production purposes. This
exercise facilitated discussion among government agencies and between GoL and
Development Partners on how these tradeoffs were being managed.

24.    Several REDD-related studies were carried out during the project, including
analyses on baselines, references levels and feasibility of financing in Dong Sithouane
PFA, a review of markets for carbon offsets, and an analysis of the village development

                                           28
fund examining the SUFORD project’s impact on poverty reduction and its implications
for REDD+ activities. In addition, Annual Review of REDD+ activities in Lao PDR,
several REDD+ Briefing Notes for DOF and a proposal for a pilot project were prepared.

25.      The DOF developed a database of Lao timber species and ToR prepared for
studies on Protection Forest System and management models in dry and mixed deciduous
forests.

Component 2: Sustainable Forest Management and Village Development

26.       Under component 2 outputs identified during project design included:

         Key natural production forests in project provinces under sustainable management
          providing products and services for the market and to meet household needs and

         Village organization capacity strengthened and forest revenue and project funds
          used to implement village development plans to meet villagers priority needs

27.    The project paper revised the expected targets under component 2 and included
delivery of the following;

         All 16 PFAs in 9 provinces with approved management plans by 2011, including
          annual operational plans for 40% of all identified FMAs.

         Independent certification maintained at least until 2011 and number FSC certified
          of FMAs increased to 20.

         Provincial level pilot analysis (based on new remote sensing technology)
          completed for 2 provinces to allow for comparison and analysis of deforestation
          trends 1992-2002 - 2008.

         Community-based NTFP monitoring system in place in selected PFAs/FMAs
          indicating trends in NTFP abundance and sustainability.

         Broad-based participation and equitable benefit sharing of forest benefits
          extended to all project areas; VD plans completed in 80% of all new project
          villages and No. of villages receiving timber revenues increased to 60% in
          existing project areas.

         Participation of ethnic minorities and poor households in forest management
          activities, including paid labor, VFOs, VFC and GVFC in new project areas,
          disaggregated by ethnic group and poverty level.

         VFO, VFC and GVFC established and functioning in all new FMAs that will be
          identified during forest management planning.


                                             29
28.     Production Forest Area Management. At project outset there was no Production
Forest system in place in Lao PDR and joint analytical work undertaken with Sweden and
Finland highlighted poor financial performance and general disarray in the forest sector.
At the time of project completion, Participatory Sustainable Forest Management (PSFM)
has been adopted as a national program expected to be operational in all PFAs by 2015
and Forest Management Plans for all PFAs selected for inclusion in SUFORD were
completed, including annual operating plans.

29.     The annual allowable cut for the SUFORD provinces was estimated at 34,483 m3
of which 15,262 m3 is in the new provinces and 19,221 m3 in old provinces. PAFOs
conducted pre-harvest inventories and other associated activities involved with
preparation of timber harvesting. Signage was installed to demarcate forest restoration
areas. Exercising an abundance of caution the timber quota and the actual harvest were
both below the estimated Annual Allowable Cut in SUFORD provinces.

30.    During implementation, SUFORD supported participatory approaches to the
development and implementation of management plans, following annual operations
plans, restoration activities, forest harvest planning and pre-harvest inventory and
harvesting of timber. The project worked most extensively with communities that had
available timber resources. Community members were involved in all aspects of forest
management planning, patrolling, and timber production although harvest operations
were undertaken by trained professionals.

31.     With project support the DOF developed, tested and introduced a manual for
forest and land use zonation. Initially capacity building focused on developing a pool of
trained DAFO staff to conduct project activities. A preliminary operability analysis was
used to identify the areas potentially most suitable for forest inventories and forest
management. A study of feasibility of different harvesting techniques was also
completed. Additional information on forest monitoring and forest certification is
included under component 3 below.

32.     Village Capacity and Priority Development Needs Addressed. Province and
District staff received training to introduce the project concept, set up village
organizations and delineate village boundaries in all provinces. A Village Development
Manual was prepared to guide data collection and link village development to forest
management.

33.     An Ethnic Group Development Strategy was prepared and agreements were
signed between the Department of Forestry and the Lao National Front for Construction
and the Lao Women’s Union to support implementation of ethnic development work.
Ethnic villages were grouped into categories depending on the degree of support they
were expected to need; associated procedures of work were developed. Ethnic support
teams at province and district level were established and trained and they visited priority
villages according to agreed work plans.




                                            30
34.      District extension officers visited all participating villages and prepared plans for
the strengthening the capacity of village organizations. Various training meetings were
held to improve monitoring of transfer and use of Village Grant funds. District staff
monitored the status of existing village development funds. VD Grants were transferred
to all villages and used to support village level sub-projects (mostly for livestock). During
the first phase of SUFORD VD grants were provided in two tranches ($3,000 and $5,000)
to each village. In many instances communities chose to manage these grants as
revolving funds targeting the poorest residents to receive small low interest loans.
Recognizing that there was limited capacity within DOF and in Laos more generally to
manage these revolving funds the practice of revolving grant funds was discontinued
during the AF phase.

35.     The TA conducted an impact assessment of the village development activities and
extension provided to villagers and government staff in collaboration with an
independent consultant. In addition, the TA conducted an inventory of the infrastructure
projects made with SUFORD funds in the old provinces. In ethnic and gender work, the
main activity consisted of monitoring the ethnic and gender performance of the ethnic
teams at provincial and district level. This activity strengthened the project structure
between the central, provincial and district level in terms of planning and coordination, in
addition to providing valuable information on the extent to which women, ethnic
minorities and poorest households have participated and have received direct benefits
from the project.

36.     During additional financing, PSFM in old provinces focused on consolidation and
ensuring that provinces were able to implement all planned activities. Of the total 412
villages, 180 or 44% received a share of timber revenue. Villages were paid on average
$183 per year (totaling $33,000 annually).

37.     The Ethnic and Gender team arranged District Level Workshops on gender and
ethnic issues in the five new provinces from February to July 2011 to clarify the role of
the Lao National Front for Construction (LNFC) and Lao Women’s Union (LWU) in
Forestry and VD work. The LNFC and LWU’s role was to facilitate communication
between technical forestry staff and ethnic groups and women. To assess the impact of
the project on ethnic groups, a monitoring study was conducted. The findings emphasize
the need for the Ethnic Teams and Technical Teams to strengthen the consultative
process. Based on the experience gained, the Implementation Framework for the Ethnic
Group and Development Plan was revised and updated to better reflect resources
available for implementation.

Component 3: Forest Sector Monitoring and Control

38.       Under component 3 the original expected output was:

         Efficient forest sector control and monitoring and improved forest law
          enforcement systems in place and operational



                                              31
39.    The project paper revised the expected targets under component 3 and included
delivery of the following;

      Pilot exercise completed using new data sources and technology to compare most
       recent forest cover changes for selected ‘hot spot’ provinces;

      Development of a comprehensive technical design and field testing for an
       integrated forest inventory and cover monitoring and data management system,
       including forest cover, quality, biomass, and carbon stocks as required under
       REDD process;

      Completion of internal control and reporting system covering forest management
       operations, conduct of timber sales procedures, revenue flows;

      Forest Law enforcement program developed and under implementation, including
       intelligence systems development; interagency agreements and operations,
       training and public awareness, and formulation of long-term Forest Law
       Enforcement Strategy; and

      Independent and internationally recognized forest management certification
       confirms sustainability of PSFM approach and DOF group certificate maintained
       beyond 2011 and pool of certified FMAs expanded to 20 by 2011.

40.    Internal Controls and Management Information System (MIS). DOF developed
and deployed a management information system to store, analyze and disseminate all
forest management and timber sales information for decision-making purposes. DOF
documents are now entered into a Document Management System (DMS). DOF has
developed databases for internal audit results, approved auditors, timber CoC tracking,
and timber sales. The DOF has worked together with DOFI to ensure that the future
DOFI information systems are fully compatible with the DOF information systems.
Annual internal monitoring was conducted in SUFORD provinces, and reports submitted
to DOF.

41.    Annual internal audits are conducted to check compliance and to progressively
improve compliance with national PSFM standards. DOF has worked together with DOFI
to ensure that the future DOFI information systems are fully compatible with the DOF
information systems, including the DOFI Intelligence Information. A system for National
Forestry Reporting was developed and deployed in all provinces.

42.     Reconciliation of harvesting and sales data is carried out to analyze the progress
of annual timber quota implementation. DOF also carries out post-harvest assessments in
all harvesting sites. DOF and DIMEX designed jointly a database system where the DOF
system monitors harvesting and transfers to commerce and the DIMEX system monitors
the transfers from forestry sector and sales volumes and value.



                                           32
43.     The Finnish TA prepared a background paper on Internal Control/Standard
operating procedures. The DOF compiled an Assessment of Performance Reporting
Practice at the Department of Forestry. Registers to keep track of Corrective Action
Requests (CARs), both from external and internal monitoring/assessment, have been
established.

44.     External Controls. With project support DOFI prepared a Forest Law
Enforcement Strategy to the Year 2020 comprising five components: (i) planning, (ii)
operations, (iii) human resource development, (iv) administration, and (v) infrastructure
development. DOFI has implemented many activities in line with the new strategy since
it was formulated, including;

      A Code of Conduct for DOFI staff was prepared and approved by the Director
       General.

      The Director General of DOFI was appointed the chairman of the ASEAN-WEN
       coordinating unit, which is a platform for collaboration between DOFI/POFI,
       Customs, Economic Police, and the Army.

      DOFI participated in a public awareness effort, which concentrated on the wildlife
       trade campaign surrounding the SE Asian Games held in Vientiane in December
       2012.

      The legal provision regarding the Disposition and Disposal of seized timber and
       equipment were reviewed.

      The Government of Lao PDR launched the Lao Wildlife Enforcement Network
       (WEN). Lao-WEN is a chapter of the ASEAN-WEN, the world’s largest wildlife
       law enforcement network that involves police, customs and environment agencies
       of all 10 ASEAN countries.

       DOFI made several high profile seizures of illegal timber and non-timber
       products.

      Training courses were arranged, inter alia, with the Public Prosecutors Office.

      A Strategic and Tactical Enforcement Patrol Project (STEPP) supported with
       funds from SUFORD and Finland has been implemented in all provinces,
       approximately eight weeks ahead of schedule.

      A survey on capacity in information technology (devices, software), related work
       in relevant institutions and development needs (capacity building and training
       needs) was conducted and a capacity development plan was prepared. Training
       was provided on database development, use of associated software, and
       operability analysis.

                                           33
45.     Forest Certification. Consistent with revised project targets independent and
internationally recognized forest management certification (Smartwood) has audited and
confirmed the sustainability of the PSFM approach in certified areas. The group
certificate (so called “pure standard?) was maintained by timely attention to Corrective
Action Requests and the pool of certified FMAs expanded to more than 20 sub- FMAs.
All FSC certificates were maintained and a new contract was signed with WWF to
expand FSC Rattan certification to two villages in Boulikhamxai. To support FSC
expansion a consultant mission was undertaken in Attapeu, Vientiane and Boulikhamxai.
DOF worked with the Provincial Forest Service (PFS) in Bolikhamxai, and Attapeu
provinces to prepare two new sub forest management units for certification against FSC
“pure standard?. Certification assessment for Controlled Wood Standard was conducted
in Dong Khapo PFA in Savannakhet and in Phoutalava and Laongam PFAs in Salavan
Province. The total area under the certification scope has been expanded to 81,618
hectares by adding three new members (Sub-FMAs) to the DOF group in 2010.

46.     Other corrective actions have been carried out by the DOF in collaboration with
DIMEX and National University of Laos. All corrective actions except those requiring
training have been addressed. A Strategy for Expansion of FSC Certified Area containing
four optional strategies was prepared and will be supported by the recently approved
FIP/IDA project. A CoC Training Course for Industry was arranged. A concrete outcome
of the training was a study documented in Report on Chain-of-Custody for Forest
Products and Expansion of Legal and Controlled Wood Sources in Lao PDR.

47.     Forest Cover Assessment and Forest Inventory. The Forest Cover Assessment
report was finalized and disseminated at Ministry and Department level and data has been
used to support policies such as Protection Forest Cover establishment. The final version
of the National Forest Inventory design document was delivered in March 2010.
Development of technical design for integrated forest inventory was completed by
organizing and converting historical datasets to modern structures. Changes in volume,
biomass and carbon between 1982 and 2002 were calculated. The project also conducted
case studies in Savannakhet province for testing new image processing techniques for
carbon monitoring. Results of the laser-scanning exercise were demonstrated and the
results were reported. A needs assessment and system design for the Forest Inventory
System of the FIPD was completed. Two major draft reports were delivered, including:
Development of FRA design for Lao PDR, and Conceptual database design for FIPD.

48.     A “hotspot? analysis was conducted to review changes in forest cover between
2011 and 2012 in Attapeu Province. This analysis supported inter-ministerial dialogue
and led to a high level field visit in April 2012. This trip provided an important
opportunity for GoL officials to become aware of the relative low cost and high degree of
analytical accuracy of change detection provided by comparing high resolution satellite
imagery between two dates.




                                           34
Component 4: Project Management

49.       Under component 4 the original expected output was:

         Effective decentralized implementation of the project supported by a good
          administrative and M&E system providing information in a timely manner to
          project management, Steering Committee and financing agencies.

50.       The project paper did not revise the expected targets under component 4.

51.      Under this component, national level management was carried out by DOF and
DOFI with subnational implementation managed by the respective Provincial Agriculture
and Forestry Office (PAFO) and District Agriculture and Forestry Office (DAFO) for
most aspects of PSFM and Village Development and the Provincial Office of Forest
Inspection (POFI) for forest law enforcement. DOF and DOFI received technical support
for project management and M&E from SUFORD and the Finland TA. A PHRD grant to
the Department of Forest Inspection also supported project management and M&E within
DOFI. During project implementation, timely assessments of Village Development
Grants, infrastructure development, timber revenue sharing and capacity of forest-related
institutions at village and sub-FMA level, as well as forest restoration activities were
completed. A review of financial management procedures was undertaken which
subsequently led to easing the administrative constraints related to release of funds.

52.     As noted earlier slow project start-up is attributed in part to limitations in the
capacity of project management during the early years of implementation. Limited
capacity at the sub-national level required Technical Assistance to devote substantial time
to capacity building and on the job training particularly in areas where skills were lacking
within the implementing agencies. Overall the international TA inputs were delivered as
planned. The total was 79.5 person-months, including 63 person months of MFA funded
inputs and 16.5 person-months of IDA funded inputs. The total input from local TA was
258 person-months. There was high turn-over in the applied anthropologist position
which only added to the challenges inherent in working with ethnic groups.

53.     The total number of IDA-training days was 7,794 (1,859 women, 5,935 men);
3,217 training days were delivered with Finnish funds (604 women, 2,613 men). With
respect to IDA and Finnish funds, female training days accounted 23.9% and 18.8% of
the total, respectively. More than 70% of all training days were provided under
component 2; the rest were divided between the other components.

54.     With respect to DOFI’s Strategic and Tactical Enforcement Patrol Program
(STEPP) a set of financial management guidelines were prepared and a series of training
sessions were conducted in four provinces and Vientiane Capital with participants from
all 17 provinces.

55.    At the provincial level, the implementation of PSFM and VD made good
progress, the pace of implementation accelerated compared to the early stages of the

                                             35
project and much of the backlog in terms of output could be cleared. At the central level,
implementation was still behind schedule, on average only 40% of the planned outputs
could be reached. To some extent, this is explained by capacity constraints.

56.    The number of TA meetings was increased to improve coordination between
various components. The detailed budget monitoring system developed by the Financial
Unit was taken into use and the first results were presented to provincial stakeholders. A
comprehensive evaluation framework to assess the performance of provincial teams was
drafted consisting of both quantitative and qualitative indicators. WB/GoF conducted
formal supervision missions regularly. From September 2006, the WB Task Team Leader
was based in Bangkok and was able to engage the project management team frequently
throughout the year.

                           Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.       There are four components associated with this project:

              i.       Support Services for Sustainable Forest Management
              ii.      Sustainable Forest Management and Village Development
              iii.     Forest Sector Monitoring and Control
              iv.      Project Management

2.      Putting in place the necessary policy, legal and regulatory framework as well as
the sector monitoring and control functions are essential for sustainable forest
management. The enabling policy environment and enforcement facilitates economic
activity and sustainable management of the resource base. These are concrete benefits
from a well-functioning policy environment. However, such benefits are hard to quantify
explicitly. For purposes of this ICRR, the team has used a similar approach to that
adopted in the PAD to project the potential benefits of improved forest resource
management.

PAD Estimated Project Benefits and Rates of Return

3.      In the PAD for SUFORD, the project was anticipated to ensure that forest
products will be harvested at maximum sustainable levels without degrading the forest
resource. The project was envisioned to reduce the incidences of improper logging
practices and illegal logging, allowing the Government to maximize rent capture from
reduced logging wastes and illegal log flows. The project objective was to manage forest
resources more sustainably, thereby maintaining the flow of environmental services and
conserving the resource bases of timber and NTFPs.

4.      At project appraisal, valuation of project benefits was based on the benefits from
sustainable management of the forest resources. The estimation in the PAD was based on
a sustainable annual yield of 0.9 m3ha as a basis for estimating the annual allowable cut
(AAC). This implied that the 195,000 ha of commercial forests in the nine production
forests would yield about 175,500 m3 of timber.1 In the estimation it was assumed that to
extract this volume, under the with-project scenario some 219,500 m3 of tree volume
would have to be cut if logging losses were equivalent to 25% of extracted volume.
Under a without-project scenario the corresponding volume would be 280,800 m3 if
logging losses were equivalent to 60% of extracted volume. 2 The difference between
these two volume estimates was used to discern the volume that would be over cut, i.e.

61,425 m3. Using a value of US$40/m3 (or 50% of the estimated stumpage value), this
volume was estimated to be worth US$2.45 million.

5.      US$2.45 million was the amount that represented the main part of the incremental
annual benefit of the project in 30 years over the without-project scenario. Incremental
benefits from existing pilot village forestry sites had been included in the analysis
because without the project the existence of overwhelmingly large areas of unmanaged
forests would put pressure on managed forests to revert back to their former unmanaged
state.

6.      The costs used in the net benefit estimation were associated with the SFM field
implementation component, including technical assistance, investments and incremental
operating costs such as salaries, per diems and O&M. Replacement costs of vehicles and
equipment were included in the cost flow over the thirty-year analysis period assuming
full replacement after every five years. Sector and country-wide costs related to the
establishment of the PFA system and sector monitoring and control were included
proportionately in the profitability analysis using cost allocation shares of 25% and 60%,
respectively.

7.      The assessed financial viability in the PAD was that the project would yield an
IRR of about 19.7%. The IRR would decrease to 15.7% if all costs would increase by
20% and to 15.6% if benefits would be delayed by two years. The IRR would increase to
23.7% if certified logs would be produced, assuming price premiums of 10% and current
level of costs associated with forest certification. This analysis was done using only the
quantifiable benefits related to timber production. It did not account for the benefits from
conservation of resource base, NTFPs, and other associated ecosystem services.

ICR Estimation Methodology

8.      For estimating the benefits from sustainable forest management, this ICR uses a
slightly different methodology than presented in the PAD. The approach involves
assessing the tangible benefits from the different components associated with the project.
As noted earlier, there are four components in this project, including project
management. Of these, component 2: Sustainable Forest Management and Village
Development has roughly 57% of the total project value (US$ 21.99 million).

9.     Using a SUFORD dataset 3 , the economic analysis for this ICR involves
estimating the aggregated cash flow for the sub-FMAs that had approved management
plans. The SUFORD dataset included estimated volumes extracted area under forest
cover and different uses, and annual allowable cut. In addition, another dataset4 from one
PFA (with 12 sub-FMAs) provided average prices and costs (including fixed annual
operating costs, forest management cost, direct investment cost, variable annual costs,

cost of harvesting and logging and cost of contractor profit, and royalties, including tax
and other duties) (Table 1). The data were used to estimate the net present value of
sustainable management of production forest areas.

10.       Some of the assumptions in the financial analysis include:

         All sub-FMAs for which management plans were pending final approval were
          included in the analysis (because it is technically recognized that these sub-FMAs
          would be up and running during the time period of the analysis)

1/ These cost values are from price and cost estimations for a subset of PFAs. It is noted
that there should be variation in the cost per PFA given the different forest types and
number of villages and sub-FMAs. Due to lack of data, however, these estimations are
being used.
2/ Price per m3 has varied during the project life. The price estimates used in various
analyses during the SUFORD and SUFORD AF project have ranged from US$ 122/m3 to
US$ 144/m3.

         The direct investment cost of forest management planning (this is distinct from
          operating cost) was spread over a period of the first three years of the project for
          both SUFORD and SUFORD AF. Accordingly, harvesting from SUFORD sub-
          FMA areas was not initiated till 2007. In SUFORD AF it is assumed that
          extraction was not initiated until 2012 given that most management plans were
          only approved in 2012


                                              39
          The level of sustainable harvesting is roughly 4m3/ha. (if only preferred species
           are considered) (SUFORD Impact Study, 2012). This information was used to
           estimate the total area from which extraction was occurring every year

          Each harvesting cycle is 15 years. Accordingly time period of the analysis extends
           from the start of the project to 14 years from the start of harvesting for SUFORD
           AF (2004 -2025)

          The dataset includes projected extraction levels for one harvesting cycle for
           SUFORD sub-FMAs and for two cycles for SUFORD AF sub-FMAs.
           Accordingly, recognizing its shortcomings, it is assumed that in SUFORD sub-
           FMAs the same volumes are extracted in the second harvesting cycle. It is noted
           that the estimated harvest for SUFORD in the second harvesting cycle does not
           include forest areas that were being managed for regeneration during the first
           harvesting cycle.

Project Benefit Cost Ratio

11.    Using the information indicated above, the cost benefit ratio, using the present
value of revenue and costs (excluding royalties), is 1.38. If royalties are included, then
the benefit cost ratio, is 0.83 (which indicates that the net present value is negative). A
price of US$ 160/m3changes the benefit cost ratio to 1 (done based on a sensitivity
analysis for price).

12.    The above financial analysis, however, does not take into account some of the
economic benefits resulting from restoration, the availability of NTFPs and other
ecological benefits resulting from management of carbon (e.g., reduced carbon
emissions).

Benefits from Carbon

13.     The Technical Report Historical Baselines, Reference Levels and Projected
crediting Scenarios in the Dong Sithuane Production Forest Area, estimates 250,000 t C
or 915, 000 t CO2e of emissions reduced over a 30 year period from SFM of 151,000 ha
in the PFA. This is approximately equivalent to an annual emissions reduction of 8333 t
C or 30, 500 t CO2e within this area.5 Using these estimates to scale up to the 16 PFAs
and using a price of US$ 5/tCO2e, the present value of the economic benefit from
reduced emissions is roughly US$ 6,657,000 over the 21 year period examined in this
analysis.

14.     The net present value of the carbon revenue stream would also depend on the
transaction costs (associated with monitoring reporting and verification and other
compliance requirements with the carbon market) and institutional costs in Lao PDR.
While not optimal, it possible to estimate the net present value of this stream of revenue
by using the values for costs from other case studies 6 and assuming all cost of
management is already reflected in the net revenue from timber. The net present value for
the period of 21 years from the start of SUFORD (with a 5 percent discount rate) would
range from US$ 4.5 million to US$ 6.3 million.

15.     While accruals for payments from environmental services were not part of this
project, there now exist opportunities for the Government of Lao to explore generating
revenues from such payments in the SUFORD PFAs.

Benefits from Non-Timber Forest Products

16.     In Lao PDR, non-timber forest products are an essential feature of rural
households’ daily lives. Income streams from these forest products are on average US$
204/household (approximately 39% of total household cash income) and non-cash
income US$489/household.7,8 NTFP collected for cash income, is expected to be subject
to a reduction of 3% per year due to degradation of the forest. In SUFORD production
forest areas, it is estimated that NTFPs are worth US$ 164/household in cash income
(which is approximately 31% of average cash income per household) and US$
653/household in noncash income.9 The NTFP are worth approximately US$ 71/ha in
SUFORD supported PFA 10 . Inclusion of this value in estimating net revenue for the
project notably increases the economic benefits of the project. Using the total forest area
that is under PFA for SUFORD and SUFORD AF, the present value of benefits from
NTFPs are equivalent to US$ 389.6 million. However, due to lack of adequate

   A recent study from Tanzania, using a bottom up approach to estimating the cost of REDD+, estimated that the
transaction costs comprised a minor share of the total costs, between US$ 0.21 - 1.46 tCO2. Similarly, the institutional
costs comprised around 1% of total REDD+ costs in a range of US$ 0.06 – 0.11 tCO2. (Merger, Eduard, Christian Held,
Timm Tennigkeit, and Tom Blomley. 2012. A bottom-up approach to estimating cost elements in REDD+ pilot
projects in Tanzania. Carbon Balance Management 7:9 (viewed online October 2012) )

  Benefit streams from NTFPs are often not factored in though they are legitimate benefits for households because there
rarely is active management for NTFPs. Moreover, few analyses take into account the labor requirements (and
therefore the opportunity cost of labor) to collect the NTFPs. This is often because NTFPs serve as a safety net and are
used for subsistence purposes or income generation during lean times and when there are no other employment
opportunities, or they are collected while undertaking other activities (e.g., herding). In Lao PDR, however, NTFPs
have featured in export revenues. Moreover, the definition used includes firewood and wild fish.

value by area, and labor costs for collection, this value is presented with some
reservations and not explicitly included in the estimation of economic benefits.

Additional Livelihood Benefits

17.    The project also included tangible benefits through village development grants
and the sharing of revenues from timber sales.

18.     The number of villages that are directly involved in forestry management are
estimated to be about 10-15% of the total number of villages (720). Therefore roughly
72-108 villages earned revenue from returns of timber sales. Information on the latter
suggests that the revenue sharing (under the benefit sharing arrangement that was in place
prior to the new decree) while positive was a nominal amount per village.

19.     To estimate livelihood benefits for the economic analysis, a subset of the
economic activities undertaken by households that received grants from the village
development fund are examined. The Impact Study on Village Development activities11
(Piechotta, 2012) shows that the grants were used for a range of household activities
(Table 2). Of these, activities such as raising cows, planting banana, planting peanuts,
weaving, and raising buffalo were considered to be successful. The impact study found
that paddy field expansion was rated far less successful in Savannakhet than in the other
provinces and raising cows was rated somewhat lower in Khammuane and Savannakhet
as compared to Champasack and Salavanh. Reports on changes in income (collected by
the impact study) validated these findings.12

20.      To analyze the economic benefits of the livelihood activity, distribution of
sampled households among the various activities is considered to be representative of the
total number households that were involved with village development activities. In the
sample, 48% of households engaged in activities that more successful than average (see
activities labeled in bold in Table 2 below). In contrast, 9% engaged in activities that did
not succeed (activities labeled in italics in Table 2 below).

21.    The Village Development Fund impact study (2012)13 also provides information
on an approximate cost per household for paddy field expansion and rearing livestock.
11
   The study was based on a sample of 12 villages in four provinces (48 in total). In each of the provinces (Savannakhet,
Champassack, Khammoune and Salavan), two districts were chosen by the data-collection teams. In each district six
villages were randomly selected from those villages for which baseline-information was available (and where there
were less than six villages in a district, villages from a third district were selected randomly). The sample consisted of
9 poor villages, 31 medium and 8 better off ones and were situated between 0 to 47 Km from the district capitals
(average23 Km). 12 households were surveyed in each village – eight households that had received the loan and 4 that
had not.

12
  An exception here is cow-raising, which reportedly changed the income slightly less positive than average. Since
cows are often used as savings and consequently not sold, this does not necessarily show less success from cow rearing.

The information on paddy reveals that households involved in paddy expansion took
loans that enabled them to expand their paddy fields between 0.1 ha and 2 ha (average 0.6
ha). The size of the expanded area depended partly on the size of the loan. A loan of US$
125 enabled farmers to expand through inputs between 0.2 ha to over 1 ha of paddy land
(average 0.4 ha).14 The majority of the farmers used the expanded area to plant rice (93%
of beneficiaries), while the remaining 7% planted rice on between 0 and 80% of the
expanded area.

22.    The rice yields ranged from 280Kg/ha to 6000Kg/ha (average 2343 Kg 15 ) per
year. Using an estimated rice price of US$ 0.38/Kg 16 , households made an average
income of US$ 775. Cost of inputs was on average US$ 122.50 (excluding labor).
Households made, on average, more than US$ 625 in additional value from expanded
paddy fields. The labor costs associated with one crop of rice, however, are not
documented. Studies on rice in Lao indicate that labor requirements for rice can be higher
in lowland rice compared to slash and burn rice (or upland rice) because of the associated
weeding.17

23.     Similarly for animal rearing, households used loans to pay for livestock and breed
more livestock. Families in some provinces received loans of US$ 287.50 18. Based on a
small sample of data points, Piechotta (2012) found that mortality of cows that were
bought from the loan was approximately 5%. In contrast the mortality rate for other
livestock was high, including: 50% of goats, 18% of buffaloes, and 20% of pigs. Farmers
tended to keep their cows and buffaloes in contrast to goats (out of which 40% were sold,
bartered or exchanged) and pigs (all were sold, bartered or exchanged)19.

24.     Newly born animals were numerous, especially for cows and goats. To 10 animals
from the loan, farmers could add another 16 cows and 13.7 goats. The price for a cow
depended on its size, including roughly 3 million kip for a large cow (Clarke, 2010).
Using the price of a large cow as an average price, the analysis suggests that households
that reared cows made positive net revenue (though cost of labor is not accounted for).

  Probably these figures slightly overestimate the production, since it seems that some data-collection staff have rather
recorded the total rice production instead of the rice production on the expanded fields only.

IMPACTS

As the Borrower’s Report exceeds the 10-page limit, a Summary is provided here. The
complete Borrower’s Report of June 11, 2012 is on file.

The main impacts of the SUFORD Project 2003-2012 are:

-   The previous regulation concerning sharing of timber revenue, MAF 0204, part of
    timber revenue was transferred to Village Development Funds and Operational Costs
    of Forest Management but the amounts were low. With the approval of the
    Presidential Decree 1, the share of timber revenue allocated for these purposes will
    increase significantly. As a result, the government sector will be able to self-finance
    the core activities. Protection, reforestation and regeneration will need additional
    funds.

-   The decline of forest cover inside most SUFORD PFAs has declined or stabilized
    whereas it continues to accelerate outside of the PFAs. The SUFORD project has
    contributed to this development by improving the rules and organization of forest
    management inside the PFA and by improving the livelihoods of people so that there
    is less pressure to use the forest resources unsustainably.

-   The Participatory Sustainable Forest Management concept developed by SUFORD is
    environmentally and socially sustainable as indicated by the fact that a significant
    portion of the forests inside the PFAs have been certified to the international FSC
    standard and DOF has been able to maintain the certificate for five years and extend it
    for another five-year period in spring 2010. These areas represent the first and largest
    areas of certified natural forest in mainland SE Asia.

-   The SUFORD project has contributed to poverty reduction, especially through loans
    given using the Village Development Grant. Before loans were received the poverty
    rate in SUFORD villages was on average 28-29 %. In 2012, it was found that among
    households that had not received a SUFORD loan, the proportion of poor households
    had dropped to 14% mainly because the overall economic development and other
    government programs had helped them. Among those who had received a SUFORD
    loan, the proportion of poor households had dropped even more to 9%. The difference
    is SUFORD’s contribution to poverty reduction.



                                            49
CONCERNS

The most significant concerns are:

-   Illegal logging or logging that is not included in forest management plans takes place
    on a scale that threatens the sustainability of forest management.

-   Procedures for management of timber revenue and other financial transactions are not
    clearly defined or transparent; there are no effective sanctions against those who
    violate the existing regulations.

-   The majority of villages inside the PFAs will not benefit from timber revenue; unless
    new policies such as village-based tenure of degraded forest land are adopted there is
    a risk that many villages will have limited interest to contribute to PSFM.

-   Land use plans sometimes do not reserve enough agricultural land for local people,
    especially for those who practice shifting cultivation. If they do not have enough land
    they may go to regeneration and restoration sites. In this case there is a risk that the
    investments made in regeneration and restorations are lost.

-   The government staff has capacity to implement the basic tasks of forest management
    but the capacity to implement work related to “new? topics such as REDD+ is still
    limited.

-   The majority of Village Development Funds are not sustainable because the managers
    of these funds in villages do not have the necessary skills; the government staff
    assisting them also lack experience in micro financing.

-   Participation of women and ethnic minority groups in forest management and village
    development activities has been integrated as part of standard procedures but
    implementation of these procedures is still weak.

OPPORTUNITES

The best future opportunities are:

-   With the development of the Monitoring, Verification and Reporting System carbon
    funding may become available in the near future; payments for other environmental
    services such as watershed protection may increase the sector financing in the
    medium term.

-   The establishment of Chain-of-Custody certification in selected wood enterprises
    creates an opportunity for the sector to access international markets with high value
    added products.


                                            50
-   Successful implementation of the proposed regulations for timber sales would
    increase timber prices and ensure that the timber goes to the most competitive
    companies with the highest development potential.

ROAD MAP

The PSFM concept in the PFAs is environmentally and financially sustainable, if
implemented properly. Timber harvesting practices are estimated to cause minimal harm
to the environment, yet the PFAs are able to generate net revenue. If the new Presidential
Decree 1 on sharing of timber revenue can be implemented effectively, it will
considerably increase the financial sustainability of PFA management. To implement the
new mechanism successfully, it is necessary to improve the procedures of financial
management and increase capacity for financial management and oversight.

One of the key challenges regarding environmental sustainability is deforestation which
has been brought under control but is still continuing in part of the PFAs as well as
outside. To halt this trend it is necessary to find alternative livelihoods for people who
continue practicing pioneering shifting cultivation and causing deforestation. In this
regard, collaboration with development efforts in other sectors is crucial as the resources
within the forest sector are a fraction of the amount of resources needed. The experience
with the Village Development Grants delivered under SUFORD shows that in the short
term they can contribute to poverty reduction and reducing pressure on forest resources.
However, the public sector does not have adequate capacity to ensure the long-term
sustainability of the revolving funds established to manage the funds at the village level.
New revolving funds should be established only if they can be integrated into commercial
micro financing schemes, for instance, through public-private partnership arrangements.

Development of village community forestry for degraded areas is another option to
motivate local people to develop and protect forest resources. In the short term, however,
the REDD+ payments may be the best opportunity to attract new financial resources to
the forest sector. More attention needs to be paid on appropriate implementation of
safeguards to secure the environmental sustainability of forest management, ethnic
people’s rights etc.

Forest restoration is an important long-term goal for the Lao government. To date, the
efforts have been constrained by lack of funding; the limited budgets have not allowed
the implementation of existing technical solutions. New opportunities are however
emerging such as payment of watershed services which should be explored further. At the
same time, development of technical solutions for forest restoration should continue. One
of the key measures is to improve land use planning to minimize the risk that the
restoration sites are converted to other land uses and that the investment is lost.

Promoting the use of wood energy is another opportunity to generate added value in the
forest sector, for instance, exports of certified charcoal and improved charcoal production
systems (e.g. Adam’s retort). At the same time, the examples from some PFAs as well as
from other countries show that uncontrolled use of firewood may have negative

                                            51
environmental impacts. More efficient use of residues in the forest and wood industries,
and promoting an improved cookstove program are examples of opportunities for
positive development that may also attract international funding through REDD+. To
ensure that these benefits are captured, the forest sector will have to actively seek
opportunities to promote sustainable use of wood energy.

Another potential threat is forest degradation which is driven mainly by illegal logging.
There are also cases where logging has not been part of the forest management plan but it
has been approved separately by the government. To contain illegal logging, it is
necessary to enhance the capacity and funding for DOFI, the law enforcement body.
Another equally important measure is to win the co-operation of the local population; the
forest area is too large to be controlled by authorities alone. It is expected that the
increase in villagers’ share of timber revenue will increase their motivation to protect the
timber resource. To ensure that logging which is based on separate approvals by the
government does not lead to degradation, it is necessary to improve the coordination
between government agencies. Although the volume of such logging is not known, it
appears significant, and there is a risk that it leads to overharvesting.

The small supply of timber supply is currently constraining efforts to increase net
revenue from PSFM. The supply is limited due to unsustainable practices in the past
which have depleted the growing stock. However, it is set to increase as the growing
stock is gradually restored. In the short and medium terms, the key to enhancing financial
returns to forest management and benefits to the economy as a whole is to encourage
improved productivity and modernization of the wood industries sector. The public sector
can facilitate this process by strictly applying competitive methods of timber sales to
ensure that the best companies with the highest development potential have access to it.
To broaden the resource base, lesser known species should be actively promoted. The
past experience also shows that creating a competitive environment encourages the
companies to use a wider range of tree species. Increasing the supply of certified timber,
including controlled wood will facilitate the Lao wood industries’ access to international
markets. The expansion of certification will be accompanied by adoption of CoC among
Lao wood industries.

Capacity building should be continued vigorously in terms of both technical and
facilitation skills. Training on technical issues should be complemented with
development of soft skills such as communication and facilitation. Sophisticated
methodologies have been developed in other sectors, for instance, by the LEAP project
but they are yet to be applied in the forest sector. In general, it is necessary to encourage
coordination between related sectors such as forestry and agriculture.
