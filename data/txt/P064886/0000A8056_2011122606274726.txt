                         government commitment to forest governance. Issues requiring continued attention to ensure sustainable project impacts include: a) finalization of timber revenue benefit-sharing
                         arrangements - a draft Presidential Decree is currently being finalized; and b) identified development activities overlapping production forest areas (mining, hydro, roads,
                         resettlement) must be reviewed and addressed by responsible agencies of Government to ensure positive outcomes for local communities.
