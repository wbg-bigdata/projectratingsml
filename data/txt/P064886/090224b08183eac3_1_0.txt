                         associated with concessions.. Priority natural production forests in a total of 9 Provinces have been brought under Participatory Sustainable Forest Management (PSFM). The area
                         of independently certified sustainable forest management has increased and areas previously certified have been re-certified for another 5 years. Villagers' support for the project

                         remains strong. Livelihood improvements are directly linked to Village Development Grants which have been delivered to all target villages. Sector monitoring and control have
                         improved with the introduction of a Strategic and Tactical Enforcement Patrol Program (STEPP) enforcement under the recently created Department of Forest Inspection. Issuance of
                         a Presidential Decree on timber revenue benefit-sharing demonstrates government’s continuing commitment to PSFM. A follow-up operation is currently under preparation with
                         support from IDA, the Forest Investment Program and the Government of Finland. Issues requiring continued attention under the planned follow on program include: a) strengthening

                         annual harvest plans; c) developing alternative livelihood options for communities with limited timber resources.
