                                EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.       The present environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) study of the
Promoting Girls Education in Balochistan (PGEB) project has been carried out in compliance
with the national environmental laws of Pakistan and the World Bank Operational Policies
(OPs). The ESIA delineates the environmental and social issues emerging from the PGEB
project, identifies the potentially adverse environmental and social impacts of the project
activities, and suggests appropriate mitigation measures to offset or reduce these impacts.
The report also suggests guidelines for environmental enhancement opportunities available
during various phases of project implementation to maximize the benefit to environment. The
mitigation measures and guidelines have been organized in the form of an environmental
and social management plan (ESMP) to be implemented by the Project Management Unit
(PMU) of the PGEB project for avoiding or mitigating the significant environment and social
impacts.

2.      The scope of the study entails assessment of the environmental and social impacts
of PGEB project activities in the selected 12 districts of the province including Kachhi,
Loralai, Jhal Magsi, Khuzdar, Kalat, Lasbela, Jaferabad, Kech, Panjgur, Kila Saifullah, Pishin
and Naseerabad districts. The project area spreads over from north to south of the province
covering almost 138,011 square kilometers (40%) area of the province. The environmental
and social assessment covers physical, biological and social impacts of project activities
during various implementation stages from site selection and designing to construction and
operational phase of the school buildings.

3.       The study is based on primary and secondary data sources. Primary sources of
information include site visits, soliciting information from key persons like Government
functionaries, line department’s briefs, focused group discussions with communities and
visual photographs taken from the field. Scoping sessions were held with relevant ministries,
departments and agencies to understand their perspectives of the project respectively and
improvise the terms of reference of the study accordingly. A specially developed impact
assessment matrix has been used for collecting first hand information from field observation,
ascertaining, and characterization of the adverse impacts on selected parameters of the
physical, biological, and social environments in the study area. The secondary sources of
information include official documents of the Government of Balochistan and Federal
Government, previous similar studies conducted in the province, papers and project brief
provided by various line departments pertaining to PGEB project, websites of the
Government and World Bank and other indirect sources of information collected from
literature review and desk analysis.

4.      Most of the environmental impacts of project activities are isolated small-scale and
site specific in nature and are of low to moderate in significance. Majority of the impacts
pertaining to construction and operation are on surface water quality, air quality, noise and
vibrations, soil erosion and land contamination, health and hygiene issues and
inconvenience to public from improper stockpiling of the materials at the schools. Most of
these impacts are of low to medium level and manageable by adopting appropriate
mitigation measures during project implementation.




                                                                                            1
5.      The ESIA proposes mitigation measures for each stage of project activity. The siting
and design stage measures include implementation of site selection guidelines, adopting
eco-friendly designing and applying appropriate building codes in the designing of school
buildings located in the earthquake prone areas and flood plains. Appropriate water efficient
design of toilets with septic tank and soaking pit, sewerage connection and provision of
proper ventilation for lighting in classrooms are some of the cardinal mitigation measures.
The construction stage measures include preemptive actions by the construction contractor
to avoid the adverse impacts, for example, covering the stockpiled materials, limiting
excavation activities after schooling hours, and ensuring worksite safety. The mitigation
measures relating to school operation include proper disposal of the solid waste, proper
maintenance of water supply and sanitation system and ensuring the supply of safe drinking
water. The application of rainwater harvesting techniques and installation of solar powered
appliances are some of the environmental enhancement opportunities available in the area
for which guidelines has been incorporated in the report.

6.      The Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) provides a comprehensive
mechanism for implementing the proposed mitigation measures and guidelines to attenuate
the adverse impacts of the project to an acceptable level The key components of the ESMP
include environmental mitigation measures and guidelines for implementation by the
architect / design engineer, construction contractor, supervision firm and monitoring by the
environmental focal persons at the provincial and district level. The parameters for
monitoring, roles and responsibilities of designated officers for monitoring have also been
described in the ESMP.

7.      An institutional mechanism has been proposed for implementing the mitigation
measures and environmental guidelines by designating focal persons at provincial, district,
and school level. The focal persons will ensure upward and downward coordination, removal
of bottlenecks, and maintaining a consolidated database. The District Environmental Focal
Persons will ensure compliance of the ESMP mitigation measures and guidelines and carry
out internal monitoring through his team with community participation in the form of Parent
Teacher School Management Committee (PTSMCs) at each school site.

8.      The ESMP also provides internal and external monitoring mechanism to ensure
observance of the ESMP mitigation guidelines at various tiers and reporting of non
compliance issues for evaluation and mid course correction by relevant actors amid project
execution. External monitoring or third party validation in the form of an annual
environmental audit has been proposed to be conducted by an experienced environmental
expert or consultancy firm. The external monitoring is aimed at reviewing the ESMP
implementation process, identify any environmental issues on ground, and offer
recommendations for keeping the project compatible with local context and changing
conditions.

9.      In order to ensure successful implementation, the ESMP proposes capacity building
of the relevant staff and designated focal persons through specific and tailor made trainings
on environmental and social impacts and mitigation measures. One- to two-days training
workshops will be held at PMU Quetta and 12 one-day workshops (one in each district)
during the project implementation phase. These workshops will be geared towards
enhancing understanding of the environmental and social issues and apprising and


                                                                                           2
sensitizing the participants about environmental and social importance of managing the on-
ground problems associated with project activities. Total 18 trainings will be held in the first
year to train the project directors, managers, engineering team, M&E Officer and
Environmental Focal Persons at provincial and district level. Refresher trainings will be
arranged during subsequent years of project duration.

10.     The estimated cost of ESMP implementation is Rs. 7.02 million for three years
project duration which includes the costs of capacity building trainings and external
monitoring or third party validation. The cost to be incurred on implementation of proposed
mitigation measures and guidelines will be included in the bidding documents for individual
school during tendering and selection/award of contract to suitable construction firm.

                                      1. INTRODUCTION

This environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) report evaluates the potentially
adverse environmental and social impacts of the Promoting Girls Education in Balochistan
(PGEB) project and provides an environmental and social management plan (ESMP) for
reducing or mitigating the significant adverse impacts.

1.1     Objectives of study
The primary objective of this study is to address the significantly adverse environmental and
social impacts of the project interventions, and propose mitigation measures in order to
ensure compliance with the World Bank’s Operational Policy (OP 4.01) and the national and
provincial legislation/regulations on environment.

The study also identifies and proposes environmental enhancement opportunities at the
educational facilities supported by the project, recommends institutional arrangements to
manage the environmental and social aspects of the project, identifies environmental and
social monitoring requirements for effective implementation of the mitigation measures and
describes the environmental and social training and reporting requirements during project
execution.

1.2     Scope of study
The project area spreads over twelve (12) districts of Balochistan covering almost 138, 011
square kilometres (40%) area of the province in terms of geographical coverage. Exibit-1
shows the geographical locations of 12 districts included in the project. The districts included
in the project are:
        1)      Kachhi              2)       Loralai
        3)      Jhal Magsi          4)       Khuzdar

        11)     Pishin              12)      Naseerabad

This study has evaluated the environmental and social impacts of the proposed project
activities during site selection and designing, construction and operational stage of the
proposed schools and mitigation measures proposed to reduce or minimize the adverse
impacts related to the project activities.

1.3     Methodology
This study was conducted according to the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)
Guidelines and rules/regulations of the Government of Pakistan and World Bank Safeguard
Policy. The following methodology was adopted:

1.3.1 Preliminary Screening
A preliminary screening of the project activities was carried out and potential
environmental issues associated with proposed project identified; and important
environmental issues were that merit were further assessed in detail in the subsequent
phases; issues that were not relevant were screened out. The key activities undertaken
during this stage included:




                                                                                              9
1.3.1.1 Understanding Project Activities
A generic description of the proposed activities such as construction of shelter less schools,
establishment of new schools with community participation and provision of missing facilities
in existing schools within the project area relevant to the environmental assessment was
obtained from the Education Department, Government of Balochistan. Meetings were also
held with Environment Specialists and Team Leader of PGEB project in the World Bank,
Education Department Officials and in depth discussions were held about the proposed
project area, activities, and associated environmental and social issues.

1.3.1.2 Literature Review
Secondary data on weather, soil, water resources, wildlife, and vegetation was collected,
reviewed and compiled from similar studies conducted in the past and published reports of
the Government of Balochistan.

1.3.1.3 Legislative Review
Information on relevant legislation, regulations, guidelines, and standards relevant to the
project was reviewed and compiled.

1.3.1.4 Identification of Potential Impacts
The information collected in the previous steps was reviewed, and potential environmental
issues identified.

1.3.2   Baseline Study

1.3.2.1 Primary Data Collection
Primary data was gathered from sample survey of schools in the project area, site
observation, visual photographs and meetings with communities. An impacts assessment
matrix was filled to identify the potential environmental and social issues relating to site
selection, construction and operation. Photographs (Fig. 1 to 36) taken during field survey
also provided qualitative information about the physical and biological conditions in the area
and associated environmental issues. About 32 schools were surveyed and data pertaining
to environmental and social issues was collected. List of the school surveyed is given at
Annex-A. Meetings and focussed group discussions held with community in the surrounding
areas also provided useful qualitative information on solid waste, water quality; health
hygiene issues. Quantitative and analytical data on air, water and land was collected from
the relevant departments and recent studies conducted by various organisation.

1.3.2.2 Secondary Data Collection
Secondary data collected from similar studies conducted in the past and published
documents, reports of the Government of Baluchistan. The following documents have been
reviewed for secondary data collection:

1.3.3 Impact Assessment
Impacts assessment of the environmental and social issues likely to arise from the
Promoting Girls Education in Balochistan (PGEB) project was carried out through impacts
assessment matrix method. The impact assessment examined the interaction of project
activities with various components of environment and its adverse impact on physical,
biological and socioeconomic conditions and suggested appropriate mitigation measures.

1.3.4 Documentation
This report was prepared according to the EIA guidelines of the Pakistan Environmental
Protection Agency and the World Bank Operational Policies for Environment and Social
Safeguards. The report includes the findings of the assessment, project impact, and
mitigation measures to be implemented during the execution of the proposed activities.

1.4    Limitation of the study
Owing to security situation in Balochistan, field visit/access to the whole project area was not
possible and, therefore, greater reliance was made on local informant and secondary
sources of information gathered from consultations with functionaries involved in the
program implementation and focus group discussions with communities in selected districts.

Professional judgement was used in predicting the environmental impacts of the program
activities and mitigation measures proposed for reducing and minimizing the impacts during
both construction and operation of proposed schools.

1.5     Overview of the project activities

       2.       REGULATORY AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
The Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) study has been carried out after
careful review of the relevant environmental and social safeguard legislation and guidelines
of the Government of Pakistan, Provincial Laws of Balochistan and the World Bank
environmental safeguard policies applicable to the PGEB project. These legislations and
policies, and their relevance to the proposed project are briefly described in this chapter.

2.1     The Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997
The Pakistan Environmental Protection Act (PEPA), 1997 is the main environmental law
providing a legal framework for the management of environmental issues in the Country. The
main objective of PEPA, 1997 is protection, conservation and improvement of the
environment, prevention and control of pollution, and promotion of sustainable development.
The Act empowers the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) and provincial
EPAs for implementing various provisions of the Act and regulations framed under this Act.
Under Section 12 of this Act, no development project can be undertaken unless an initial
environmental examination (IEE) or an environmental impact assessment (EIA) has been
conducted and environmental approval obtained from the Federal EPA or the respective
provincial EPA if the development project area falls in the jurisdiction of the province. Failure
to conduct IEE or EIA is an offence punishable with fine, or imprisonment, or both under
Section 17 of the Act. The present environmental and social impact assessment has been
conducted in consonance with the provisions of section 12 of this Act.

2.2     The IEE/EIA Regulations, 2000
The Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Review of IEE/EIA Regulations), 2000
categorises the projects requiring an IEE or an EIA in Schedules I and II, respectively. Those
projects enlisted in Schedule-I require an IEE and those in Schedule-II requires a full-scale
EIA study. The Regulations-2000 describes the procedures concerning filing and review of
IEE and EIA reports, holding of public consultation and issuance of environmental approvals.
The Regulations-2000 also prescribe the IEE/EIA review fee to be paid by the proponent
upon filing the report with EPA, time limits for completing the review, and conditions of
environmental approval. The Regulations authorize the Government to issue specific
guidelines for projects not listed in Schedule-I or II but located in environmentally sensitive
areas to file an EIA for any type of project.

The construction of schools or educational facilities is not listed in either schedule I or II of
the IEE/EIA Regulation-2000.

2.3     The Balochistan Wildlife Act, 1974
The Baluchistan Wildlife Act, 1974 caters for protection of wildlife resources in the province.
Besides ensuring an environment conducive for their rearing and propagation of wildlife, the
Act also regulates hunting, poaching, possession, and trade in birds and animals. The Act
also prescribes penalties for its contraventions. Government can notify and amend lists of
protected ecosystems, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, safari parks, and game reserves.
The lists of protected area such as National Parks, Wildlife Sanctuaries, Game Reserves
and wildlife species, protected under the Balochistan Wildlife Act, 1996 are given at Annex-
B and Annex-C. Any sort of development activities including schools construction and
operation under the proposed PGEB project are not allowed in the protected areas. The
Education Department Balochistan will ensure that lands donated by community for

                                                                                              14
establishment of new community schools is not located in any notified game reserve or
protected areas regulated under the Balochistan Wildlife Act, 1974.

2.4     The Federal Antiquities Act, 1975
The Antiquities Act of 1975 ensures the protection of cultural resources in Pakistan. The Act
provide legal basis to protect ‘antiquities’ from destruction, theft, negligence, unlawful
excavation, trade and export. Antiquities have been defined in the Act as ancient products of
human activity, historical sites, or sites of anthropological or cultural interest or national
monuments. The law prohibits new construction of buildings in the proximity of a protected
antiquity and empowers the Government of Pakistan to prohibit excavation in any area that
may contain articles of archeological significance. Under this Act, the proponents of project
are obligated to ensure that no activity is undertaken in the proximity of a protected antiquity,
and if during the course of the project an archeological discovery is made, it should be
protected and reported to the Department of Archeology, Government of Pakistan, for further
action. This Act is applicable to the new construction of school buildings and O&M activities
of the proposed project.

There are total 389 officially notified sites of cultural and archaeological importance in
Pakistan protected under the Federal Antiquities Act, 1975. Out of these 389 sites, 27 sites
are located in Balochistan province (Annex-D). No activity will be carried out at or in the
immediate vicinity of these sites under the proposed PGEB project.

2.5    Pak EPA Environmental Guidelines
The Pak-EPA has published a set of environmental assessment guidelines for conducting
environmental assessments and the environmental management of different types of
development projects. The guidelines that are relevant to the proposed project are listed
below:
     Guidelines for the Preparation and Review of Environmental Reports, Pakistan
       Environmental Protection Agency, 1997
     Guidelines for Sensitive and Critical Areas, Pakistan Environmental Protection
       Agency, October, 1997
     Environmental Assessment and Checklists for Construction of Rural Schools and
       Basic Health Units, (May,2004)

This ESIA has been prepared in line with the above guidelines

2.6     National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) of Pakistan
The Government of Pakistan has notified the National Environmental Quality Standards of
Pakistan under Section 11 of PEPA, 1997. According to Section 11 of the Act, all the
industrial and municipal effluents discharges and emissions from industrial and vehicular
exhausts will comply with the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) of Pakistan.
The NEQS (Annex-E) include standard for noise, drinking water quality, and vehicular
exhaust emissions. The PGEB project activities shall comply with these standards.

2.7    Pakistan Employment of Children’s Act, 1991
According to this Act, no child shall be employed or permitted to work in any of the
occupations e.g. skilled and unskilled labour work or in any other activity who has not
completed his fourteenth (14) year of age. The Act also laid down the standards and

                                                                                              15
procedures for working hours and wages. The ESMP includes guidelines for employment of
labours in the PGEB project (Section 8.3.8), which will be implemented during project
execution.

2.8     Land Acquisition (Balochistan Amendment) Act, 1985
This Act, empower the Government of Balochistan to acquire any land for public use
including the establishment and construction of educational facilities and provide
compensation to the landowner according to the procedure described in this Act. The PGEB
project operations do not involve any land acquisition under this Act. The community will
provide land by mutation in the name of the Government, and the project will construct the
shelter less school buildings already in operation. Hence, the Act is not applicable to the
PGEB project activities.

2.9    World Bank Operational Policy Framework:

2.9.1 World Bank OP 4.01- Environmental Assessment
This Operational Policy (OP) requires Environmental Assessment to be conducted of
projects proposed for Bank financing to help ensure that they are environmentally sound and
sustainable with an objective to improve decision-making process. The OP 4.01 also
categorizes projects in one of the following categories based on type, location, sensitivity,
and scale of the project and the nature and magnitude of its potential environmental impacts.

The PGEB project activities are likely to have low to medium level of adverse impacts on
environment and human population and therefore the project is classified as Category B.
This ESIA study has been prepared in response to the Operational Policy 4.01 considering
the cumulative potential environmental and social impacts arising from PGEB project
operations.

2.9.2 World Bank OP 4.04 – Natural Habitat
The conservation of natural habitats, like other measures that protect and enhance the
environment, is essential for long-term sustainable development. Through this OP, the WB
supports the protection, maintenance, and rehabilitation of natural habitats and their
functions.

PGEB project activities include limited amount of construction work related to expansion of
existing school buildings, provision of missing facilities in the existing schools and
construction of buildings for the existing shelter-less schools. None of these activities are
likely to affect any of the natural habitats. Moreover, construction or excavation activities will
not be carried out in the areas listed in Annex-B and Annex-C. Hence, this OP does not
trigger.

2.9.3 World Bank OP 4.09 – Pest Management
Through this OP, the WB supports a strategy that promotes use of biological or
environmental control methods and reduces reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides.

The PGEB project does not involve any activity relating to agriculture production such as use
of pesticides, fertilizer or other chemical inputs except painting of doors and windows.
Hence, this OP is not applicable to the PGEB project and the OP does not trigger.

                                                                                               16
2.9.4 World Bank OP 4.10 – Indigenous Peoples
This OP defines the process to follow if the project activities affect the indigenous people.
Indigenous people are those having:
     self-identification as members of a distinct indigenous cultural group and recognition
       of this identity by others;
     collective attachment to geographically distinct habitats or ancestral territories in the
       project area; and to the natural resources in these habitats and territories;
     customary cultural, economic, social, or political institutions that are separate from
       those of the dominant society and culture; and
     Speak indigenous language, often different from the rest of the country or region.

This OP is not applicable to the PGEB project since there are no reported indigenous
peoples in the project area.

2.9.5 World Bank OP 4.11 – Cultural Property
The World Bank’s general policy regarding cultural property (i.e., sites/artefacts of
archaeological, cultural, historical, or religious significance) is to assist in their preservation,
and to avoid their elimination. The construction of shelter less schools and provision of
missing facilities to the existing schools under the PGEB project is not likely to pose any
risks to the cultural properties, assuming that they are already there and will not include any
large-scale excavations or demolition of buildings. Hence no cultural property is likely to be
affected which may trigger this OP. However, should any such sites or artefacts are
discovered during project implementation, will be reported to the concerned department for
preservation according to the relevant laws1 and guidelines2. Detailed procedure for “chance
find? management of archaeological site or artefacts is given in Section 2.10.5. Moreover,
construction activities under the project will not be carried out in areas listed in Annex-D.

2.9.6 World Bank OP 4.12 - Involuntary Resettlement
This OP includes safeguards to address and mitigate the impoverishment risks (dislocation,
asset loss, income loss, and others) associated with the involuntary resettlement caused due
to the project operation. The PGEB project operations such as construction of shelter less
schools, provision of missing facilities in existing schools and establishment of new primary
schools through community participation does not envisage any land acquisition. Most of the
new construction as part of the project will be carried out on existing school premises or the
community will voluntarily donate a vacant land; thus, it will not cause any involuntary
resettlement. Hence, this OP does not trigger.

2.9.7 World Bank OP 4.36 - Forestry
The objective of this OP is to assist the WB’s borrowers to harness the potential of forests to
reduce poverty in a sustainable manner, integrate forests effectively into sustainable
economic development, and protect the vital local and global environmental services and
values of forests.

The rehabilitation and construction work under PGEB project will be carried out in the
existing facilities, which are in the rural and urban areas and therefore, designated forest
area is not likely to be affected. Minor cutting of trees, if any, will be compensated through
tree plantation in the schools premises. Hence, this OP does not trigger.

                             3. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT

3.1     Objectives of Project
PGEB project aims to improve availability and accessibility of education facilities for all
children, with a special emphasis on promotion of girl’s education, in the province of
Balochistan.

3.2   Project Components
The PGEB project has the following four major components:
     Construction of shelter less girls’ schools
     Provision of missing facilities for girl’s schools
     Establishment of new primary schools with community participation
     Technical Assistance to Education Department for PGEB implementation

For construction of shelter less schools and missing facilities, Secondary Education
Department (SED) of Balochistan has done an initial short listing of districts. The short listing
took into account the districts with highest frequency of shelter less schools and highest
average enrolments. The shortlisted districts are:

                             Number of proposed                            Average Enrolment

3.2.1 Construction of Shelter less Girls schools
Under this component of the project, shelter less schools, currently running in tents,
community houses, mosques or wooden and grass made temporary structures, will be
constructed with the support from the local community. About 120 primary and 10 middle
level shelter less schools will be constructed in selected 12 districts. The list of schools will
be finalized after a physical verification of the site and confirmation of availability of teachers
and enrollment. The project will focus only on girl’s school. For construction work a
registered firm/organization will be contracted to carry out the construction activities in
coordination with stakeholders instead of C&W department. The communities around the
newly constructed schools will be organized by the Education Department as Parent
Teachers School Management Committee (PTSMC) to ensure the local support for effective
implementation.


                                                                                                21
No land acquisition is involved in this component, since these are existing schools and the
education department has already procured land for the school sites. Prioritization of the
schools for construction will rely on the availability of land. The construction firm hired for the
project will use the approved design. The design will cater for locally available material and
skilled labour to support local economy as a spin-off of the project. An Infrastructure
Specialist will be appointed by the project to monitor all the construction activities on the
ground. Site location, construction and operational stages of such schools will be the focus
for environmental and social impact assessment and mitigation.

3.2.2 Provision of Missing Facilities for Girls Schools
The constructional activities under this component relate to the construction of boundary
walls, provision of toilets, provision of drinking water etc. Exact number of schools for
provision of missing facilities is not yet available. The education department Baluchistan is
conducting an exercise to collect information about such schools and final list of schools
shall be determined after the survey is completed. The list of facilities will be finalized after
verification and prioritized based needs on established criteria.

Depending on specific needs and other determining factors, the number, size, and extent of
facilities to be provided under this component will vary from school to school. Physical
activities under this component of project include the following:
     Repair, rehabilitation, and reinforcement of existing structures;
     Construction of boundary walls;
     Construction of additional classrooms;
     Construction of toilets and lavatories;
     Provision of electricity;
     Provision of drinking water etc

The PTSMC establishment and involvement in the rehabilitation work will be an important
aspect of the project and will be carried out with coordination of outsourced firm, local
communities and stake holders. Environmental issues associated with construction and
operation of these schools will be the main focus in impact assessment.

3.2.3 Establishment of Mix Gender Primary Schools
Under this component of project new primary schools (mixed gender) will be established with
community participation in the rural areas of Balochistan, where community is able to enroll
at least 20 students in school, there is no school within a 2-km radius and the community is
able to temporarily provide space for the school. No construction is envisioned in the project
period as it is important to stabilize the school and ensure its functionality before embarking
on construction.

The site selection for establishment of the school with community support will be prioritized
based on established criteria ensuring outreach to maximum number of out of school
children and confirmed availability of local teachers. The community will actively be involved
in the management of schools to ensure local support and protection for the facility, children
and teachers. The established demand and support from the community is an essential need
in a conflict and insecure environment, where government outreach is limited. About 150
new (mixed gender) community schools will be established in the second year of the project.
These will be formal primary schools which will be financed under the project in mostly rural

                                                                                                22
areas. The project will also monitor performance of the schools and; arrange for capacity
building of the community.

The project will invite applications from the communities through advertisements in the news
papers and also procure the services of a capacity building firm to work with the
communities to support the schools.

The PTSMC would support the education department to supervise the community school.
The government schools will be funded by the regular budget of the government, however
some support is also expected from the project in the form of teaching material and capacity
building. If the school successfully maintains enrolment for two years and community
donates land by formally transferring ownership of land by mutation to the Government, the
Government will provide adequate funding for a new permanent school building.

3.2.4 Technical Assistance to Education Department
This component will support the establishment of systems and procedures for effective
planning and implementation of construction and rehabilitation activities, introduction of
new/innovative approaches for community-government partnerships, establishment of robust
monitoring systems, third party monitoring, and the development of a communications
strategy. A Project Management Unit (PMU) will be establish in the Secondary Education
Department (SED), which will be responsible for the day-to-day management and
implementation of project activities in close coordination with contracted firms, District
officials, PTSMCs and the relevant provincial offices

3.3    Description of Physical Activities

3.3.1 Site Selection and Designing
This stage would include activities relating to the selection of an appropriate site for new
schools construction, identification of existing schools to be supported under the project,
preparation of project documents, layout plans, and structural drawings for new construction,
need assessment for missing facilities, preparation of bidding document, obtaining approvals
from relevant agencies and departments, and award of contracts/work orders to the
contractor.

3.3.2 School Construction Stage
The activities at this stage would comprise of mobilization of machinery and materials to the
sites for new construction and repair works, procurement and onsite stockpiling of
construction materials, excavations for foundations, construction of superstructures, removal
of unspent materials and debris, and external development comprising of landscaping,
beautification and tree plantation.

3.3.3 School Operation Stage
The activities during this stage would relate to usage of the school buildings for education
and learning, use of drinking water, collection and disposal of wastewater and solid waste,
and annual repair and maintenance of the civil structures and equipment.

                        4. BASELINE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
This chapter provides an overview of the baseline environmental conditions including
physical, biological and socio-economic profiles of the project areas.

4.1      Project Area
The PGEB project area spreads over 12 districts including Kachhi, Loralai, Jhal Magsi,
Khuzdar, Kalat, Lasbella, Jaffer Abad, Kech, Panjgur, Killa Saifulla, Pishin and Naseer Abad
districts, covering almost 40 percent area (138, 011 square kilometer) of Balochistan. The
geographical distribution of project area spread over from Kech district in south to Killa
Saifullah district in the north of the province. This chapter describes baseline environmental
conditions of the province with district variations, where applicable in the project area.
Exhibit-2 present a map showing the geophysical features of the province.

4.2      Geography
Balochistan province is the largest in size and the smallest in population with about 8.912
million people3. However, according to preliminary censes report 2012, the population of the
province has increased to 13.162 million 4 peoples. The province covers 347,200 k m 2 ,
almost 44% of the country‘s land area. The province is located in south-western side of
Pakistan at 32.12oN 67.01oE coordinates bordering by Iran to the west, Afghanistan to the
north-west, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and FATA to the north and Punjab to the northeast and
Sindh to the southeast of the province. The district wise area and population of selected 12
districts are given in Table-1.

4.3     Topography and climate
About 80 percent of the area of the province is inter-mountainous. The remaining 20
percent consists of flood plains and coastal plains. Due to dominated mountainous terrain,
only 15 percent of the landscape is available for landforms on which most human
settlements, farms, and roads are developed. The important mountains ranges are
Suleiman Range, Kirthar Range, Central Brahui Range, Toba-Kakar-Kakarkhurasan
Range, Marri-Bugti Hills, Chagai-Hills, Ras Koh Range and Makran Coastal Range.
The climate of Balochistan is continental semi-arid Mediterranean, with annual
precipitation varying from 200 to 350 mm and a variable proportion of this total fall as
moisture of snow and rain in the mid winter period or as intense showers in summer. The
uniform aridity (average annual rainfall not exceeding 400 mm anywhere, but in many parts
as low as 50 mm annually) makes un-irrigated agriculture impossible5.

Altitude determines the temperature regime in Balochistan to a large extent. The cool
temperature regime is associated with high altitudinal belt (>2000m) and indicated by the
juniper, conifers and pines in the N-S range of the Central Mountains Range. Coastal
temperature regime is moderate having lower annual precipitation range and therefore
implies lower heat and cold for natural vegetation, crops and animals. The continental
climate has more extreme temperatures with high annual and daily precipitation range.
Humidity is low for most of the year except for the rainy seasons.

  Environmental Profile, Balochistan (LARUS-IT, Enschede: Netherland, 1992)

                                                                                                      25
Geologically, the province is divided into four main geological regions. Central Mountains
Range, Chagai Hills and Ras Koh Range, Makran Mountains Range and Chagai – Kharan
Basin. The hills and mountains ranges consist predominantly of folded and faulted Mesozoic
to middle Tertiary limestone. Mesozoic and tertiary sedimentary rocks, mostly inter
bedded limestone, sandstone, shale and marls make up the bulk of the Central
Mountains Range. Similar sedimentary rocks in addition to the Calc-alkaline and
ultramafic intrusions are found together with young quaternary volcanic rocks in the
Ras Koh Range. This range is favourable for copper, iron and sulphur deposits
(Saindak) 6. The Makran Mountains Range includes central and coastal ranges and is
mainly made up of uniform sequence of tertiary and quaternary sedimentary rocks. The
Chagai-Kharan Basin is mostly desert basin partly filled with younger sedimentary
rocks derived from surrounding mountains ranges.

4.5     Land Use and Soil Erosion
In Balochistan, mountains dominate the terrain, and valley floors and piedmont plains make
up only 15 percent of the landscape7. The relief8 or “physiographic unit? is of utmost
importance in Balochistan since this collects and concentrates the scarce rainfall. Relief is
categorized into mountains, hills, basin and piedmont plains. Under the prevailing arid
conditions, relief determines largely the availability of land for crops and vegetation potential.
Balochistan comprises of the following relief or physiographic units.
    - High and low mountains (51.7 percent )
    - Gravelly fans and terraces (21.5 percent)
    - Piedmont plains (11.6 percent)
    - Saline basin (2 percent)
    - Loess plains (0.4 percent)
    - sand plains (7.5 percent)
    - river plains (2.8 percent) and
    - tidal plains (0.8 percent)

These reliefs represent the Micro-Land Management System in Balochistan. In east central
and northern part of the province are the high mountains reaching an elevation above 2300
meters and the valleys situated at around 1500 meters above the sea level. The lowest
mountains ranges are generally below 2300 meters and their valleys go down to 76 meters
above the sea level.

According to the Development Statistics of Balochistan, the reported area of the province
is about half of the total area. The variation from district to district is also considerable.
However, i t is assumed that all agricultural and forestry uses are reported, and that there
are no significant areas of cultivated land in the unreported area. The principal land uses9
in the province are agriculture which is about 1.5 to 1.6 million hectare (4 percent), forests
about 1.1 million hectare (3 percent), rangelands about 21 million hectares (60 percent) and
area not available for cultivation is about 11.1 million hectares (32 percent). Out of the total
cultivated area, 40 percent i s irrigated land while 60 percent is rain-fed area. Land uses in
the province have been exhibiting change from agricultural to residential and built-up

structures. Whereas, land use in the urban centres is predominantly of fixed and permanent
structures, it is of mixed disposition in the suburbs and along outer rim of the cities, where
agricultural lands interpose with new constructions, inhabitations, and farmhouses10. Table-
2, describes district wise land utilisation in the project area.

Soil degradation is one of the major environmental problems in the province. Salinity and soil
erosion are the major environmental issues. Given the climate, both natural and man-made
soil salinity is component of desertification. Natural salinity occurs throughout the province in
the playas where run on water evaporate and consequently dissolved solids accumulate.
About three quarter of the piedmont basin soils is naturally saline11. Man-made salinity
occurs on the piedmont plain in the command area of Kirthar Canal which is caused due to
unsustainable design of irrigation practices, lack of proper drainage structures leading to
water logging and salt accumulation. About 30 to 40 percent of Kirthar Canal command area
is affected by man-made salinisation. However, fortunately both the natural and man-made
salinity in Balochistan is self reclaimable but requires some years of ample irrigation to leach
the salts12. Soil erosion continues throughout the province particularly on the rangeland and
leads to increased sediment loads in the rivers, loss of top soil containing most of the
nutrients and organic matter on arable land and barren mountain slopes reducing moisture
storage capacity resulting into large-scale flash floods during monsoon13.

Rangeland degradation is another issue usually associated with grazing. However, a major
factor causing range degradation in Balochistan is the cutting and uprooting of native trees
and shrubs by peoples for fuel wood. Cutting of trees and shrubs is more severe in about 5
km radius of villages and towns, particularly refugee’s camps in Balochistan. This has also
contributed toward desertification and degradation of environment14.

4.6     Soil Morphology
Most soil in Balochistan has a homogenous porous structure invariably calcareous in nature.
The lime content of soil varies from five to 30 percent. Lime is uniformly distributed in most
soil texture. Where having a high lime content (> 15 percent), the soil is hard when dry and
friable when moist. The organic matter content is generally low as 0.3 to 0.5 percent. Most of
the surface of mountains and hills slopes is bare rock without soil cover (about 70 percent).
Small patches contain shallow, strongly calcareous, gravelly and stony loams. Soil in the
piedmont plains is very deep, well drained, homogeneous, silty and strongly calcareous with
an 18-20 percent lime content uniformly distributed15.

Soil of the saline basin (playas) is characterised by being strongly hygroscopic, gypsiferous
and saline with local sodicity and pH value of 8.6 – 10.0. The loess plains have brown silt
loams or very fine sandy loams and are strongly calcareous containing about 22 percent
calcium carbonate. While sandy plains are extremely homogeneous in soil. The lime content
ranges between 5 and 10 percent16.

4.7     Seismology
Pakistan have been divided into four main Seismic zones in term of major, moderate, minor
and negligible zones with respect to ground acceleration values. A seismic map showing
different seismic zones is given in Exhibit-3. According to this map, most parts of the
Baluchistan province lie in the Earthquake Zones Classification of the Uniform Building Code
(UBC – 1997) of the United States. Southern Balochistan lies in Zone-4. The Central Brahui
range, Siahan range, Kirthar range and the Central Makran mountain ranges run through
this zone. Northern part of Balochistan lies in Zone-2 while Quetta – Sibi belt lies in Zone-3.
The geological and seismological features of this zone are almost similar to those of Zone
217. Earthquakes and tsunamis have shaped the history of the province and have had a
profound effect on people and property. An earthquake of magnitude 4.8 rector scale was
recorded at 13:28 hours midnight in Kalat and Quetta on 26th May 2012 while the field
assessment was underway for this study.

4.8     Surface and Groundwater Resources
Balochistan is water starved and land rich area of Pakistan. Surface water mainly comes
from precipitation in the form of surface runoff and its share of water from the Indus River.
Surface water resources are very limited, except Naseer Abad and Jaffer Abad districts,
which are fed by the pat Feeder, the Desert and Kirthar Canals emanating from Guddu and
Sukkur Barrages on the Indus River. Remaining part of the province depends on rainfalls,
tube-wells, Kareeze, flows, flood flows, hill torrent and diversions from non-perennials
streams, which bring substantial runoff during the rainy seasons18. The main non-perennials
rivers and streams in the province and project area are given in Table-3.

Ground water resources divide into three hydrological regions: the Nari Basin, the Kharan
closed Basin and the Makran Coast, which constitute approximately 73 small or large rivers
and streams. According to an estimate the total water potential of the province are 22.116
million acre feet (MAF) originating from the following sources19:

     A. Indus Water as per Indus Accord                            B. Non-Indus Basin Water Potential
        a. Perennial Flow = 3.87 MAF                                   a. Flood Runoff =12.756MAF
        b. Flood flow = 4.620 MAF                                      b. Ground Water = 0.87 MAF
The groundwater occurs in the unconsolidated deposits in Balochistan. Layers of gravel with
sand, slit and clay constitute the aquifers. Generally, groundwater occurs under water table
conditions but water is also found under cartesian and semi-cartesian conditions at few
places in Quetta, Kuchlak, Mastung, Panjgur and Kachhi plain20. Gravel aquifers occur in the
hydrologic basin of mountainous areas of the province. Fissured aquifers exist in hard rocks,
which permit storage and movement of water. These aquifers are widely spread in
Balochistan. The groundwater in fissured aquifers in carbonate rocks of Quetta and Kalat
has locally been developed through tube wells. The sedimentary rocks in northern areas of
the province bear water due to fissures or faults exposed to the surface.

The ground water potential of the province has estimated21 in terms of flow at 1,116 cusecs
(cubic feet per second), while 687 cusecs were already utilised, which leaves 429 cusecs for
future development. Ground water is the essential renewable natural resource in most part
of Balochistan. The most important income generating activities, irrigated horticulture and
pastoralism, depend mainly on ground water. Exhibit-4 shows the ground water potential of
hydrological basin of the province.

Water quality analysis of four major cities i.e. Quetta, Khuzdar, Loralai and Ziarat were
carried out by National Water Quality Monitoring Program (NWQMP)22 in which total 66
water sources were monitored. In Khuzdar and Loralai 91 percent of water, samples were
found unsafe due to bacteriological contamination. In Quetta, 76 percent samples were
unsafe, mainly due to bacteriological contaminants, excessive iron, fluoride and nitrate
content. Only eight sources out of 34 were supplying safe drinking water in Quetta. The worst
water quality situation was recorded in Ziarat, where all the 10 selected sources were
contaminated. Analysis report of these cities is given in Table-4, 5, 6 and 7.

Water availability is the ultimate issue all over the province. It is also a major cause of social
disputes among the tribes. Customary tribal law determines water use rights in Balochistan.
These rights are mostly linked with the land rights. Among the tribes, water can be used
freely for drinking, animal watering, and domestic purposes such as bathing, washing and
cleaning by everybody. Universal domestic use rights apply only to water on the spot or
fetched in buckets and pitchers, but do not allow the construction of channels or pipes to
homes for this purpose23.

With the changing climatic conditions and the drought prevailing over the past several years
has created acute water shortage and endangered the sustainability of this precious
resource. The over exploitation of ground water resources poses a major threat to
environment, health, food security and a threat to the welfare of poor. The focus of the
groundwater exploitation in the province had been the three hydrological basins being
densely populated and having greater potential for development. These are Pishin Lora
Basin (PLB), Nari River Basin (NRB), and Zhob River Basin (ZRB). Due to unplanned tube-
wells installation and subsequent indiscriminate pumping of water for the last two and a half
decades, the area is now facing problem of depleting groundwater table at the rate of more
than four to five meters annually in many of its aquifers and hence tube-wells drying is a
common phenomenon24.

4.9       Meteorology, Climate, and Air Quality

Balochistan is generally an arid region with scanty rainfall varying from 12 inches in the
North to 4 inches per annum in the South. According to the rainfall25, data collected over a
period of 1961 – 2004 the province divides into different climatic zones with varying level of
annual precipitation. Zone I includes Gwadar, Kech, and Panjgur districts with annual rainfall
varies from 36-110 mm and increases with increase in altitude. Maximum rainfall occurs in

the months from January to March (45 to 73 percent) and minimum during monsoon. Zone
II consists of Chagi and Kharan districts with annual rainfall varying from 30-160 mm.
Maximum rainfall occurs in the months from January to March (30 to 50 percent). Zone III
includes the districts of Lasbela and Awaran and southern part of Khuzdar district with
annual rainfall varies from 110-250 mm. Zone IV consists of Kalat and northern tip of
Khuzdar district. Average annual rainfall was between 90 - 200 mm. Quetta, Pishin,
Mastung, Qila Abdullah, Killa Saifullah (60 percent west) and Ziarat districts are included in
Zone V. The rainfall in this zone varies from 200-280 mm/year. The maximum rainfall occurs
in the months from January to April (70 percent) and is out of the monsoonal belt. Zone VI
consists of the northern part of the province including Musakhel, Loralai, Kohlu, Barkhan,
Zhob and Kila Saifullah (40 percent east). The average rainfall varies from 200-400 mm/year
in this area.

Air quality study of the capital city (Quetta) of the province indicates that the pollutants of
various kinds are affecting the city badly26. The lead and sulphur dioxide pollutants are
higher than other pollutants. Motor vehicles/ automobiles constitute the main source of air
pollution in Quetta city. Domestic industries, power plants and biological contents in Quetta
city are the dominant sources of air pollution. Authentic air quality data for other cities and
districts could not found. However, generally observed during field visit, air pollution situation
in other cities such as Pishin, Loralai and Khuzdar was comparatively less than the capital
city of Quetta.

Ambient concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) and dust particles (TSP) in Quetta was
recorded (1981) as 10 ppm, and 200 -300 ug/cm3 respectively27. Pak EPA also carried out
monitoring of ambient air quality in Quetta in May 2011 and reported daily mean value for
SO2, NO, NO2, CO and O3 satisfied the standards value of WHO limits, while PM2.5
values mostly exceeded standard28. Air pollution in other urban centres has not been
measured and reported. However, it is presumed that the same level of air quality prevail in
rest of the cities as well. Although, neither industrial pollution nor agro-chemical pollution
have been reported in Balochistan but several sources of chemical pollution of air, water and
soil are suspected. Around 100 or so industries with about 20, 000 total employees operating
in Hub Industrial and Trading Estate discharge their untreated effluents in the estate
sewerage, which outflows to a dry riverbed, a tributary of the Hub River downstream of the
Hub Reservoir29. The use of agro chemicals, both fertilizers and pesticides also requires
attention especially in the ground water irrigated vegetables and fruit cultivation. Persistent
pesticides with human and environmental health hazards are probably used in the orchards,
which could find back into the aquifers, used for drinking purposes. Therefore, monitoring of
water quality is important in such locations30.

4.10 Forests, Habitat, and Ecologically Sensitive Areas
Balochistan has a total area of 34 million hectare, of which only 4 percent (1.47 million
hectare) is under cultivation, while 60 percent of the cultivated area is rain-fed.
Approximately, 93 percent of this area is rangelands. Arid and semi-arid areas are falling

within the rainfall zones of 50-200 mm and 250-400 mm, respectively. Rainfall patterns are
unpredictable due to great fluctuations in its pattern. The rangelands provide a diversity of
uses, including forage for livestock, wildlife habitat, medicinal plants, water storage and
distribution, energy, minerals, fuel-wood, recreational activity, wilderness and natural
beauty31.

Forests
Major types of natural forests found in Balochistan are coniferous forests, scrub forests,
sub- tropical desert and riverain forests32. Coniferous forests occur at elevations of
1,500–3,500 metres and include chilghoza (Pinus gerardiana) a n d D r y Juniper F o r e s t
(Juniperus excelsa). Chilghoza are confined to the Suleiman Mountains, in the Shirani tribal
area (Zhob District), ranging from 2,700 to 3,400 metres in elevation. The main chilghoza
areas are found at Shinghar, Kaisaghar, Takht-e-Suleiman and Torghar. In Shinghar, 2,562
hectares are included in state forests, while the Shirani tribe owns the remainder.
Chilghoza is the dominant species, with the sporadic occurrence of kail (Pinus wallichiana)
in the upper reaches of Takht-e- Suleiman and Torghar.

Balochistan has one of the largest areas of juniper forests in the world. They cover
approximately 141,000 hectares. The most extensive (86,000 hectares) and best-known
examples are Ziarat and Zarghoon hills. Scrub forests are found at elevations of 500–
1,500 metres in the province including the following three categories:
- Dry Temperate Scrub - Quetta, Mastung, Kalat, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Kila Saifullah
- Dry Sub-tropical broad-leaved Forests – Suleiman Mountains
- Tropical Thorn Forests – Sibi Plains and Nok Kundi

Sub-tropical desert forests are found in Kharan and Chagai districts at elevation of 480 -
1220 meters and in dry salt lakes such as Hamun-e-Lora and Hamun-e- Mashkel at
elevation 610 – 860 meters. Riverain and Mangrove forests spread over an area of about
20,000 hectares33 as per Forestry Sector Master Plan of Balochistan, including private forests
in district Sibi and Lasbela. These forests have been severely damaged. Remnants of
mangroves occur along the coast in districts Lasbela and Gwadar. District wise
distribution of forests in the project area is given in Table-834.

Cultivated forests by Forest and Wildlife Department of Balochistan on road and canal side
plantations in Naseer Abad, Jaffer Abad, Sibi, Quetta, Bolan, Kalat, Khuzdar, Zhob and
Pishin districts cover a length of 700 Average Kilometer. Sand dunes in Mastung,
Mashkhel, Pasni, Gwadar, Pishukan and Nushki areas have been planted. Cultivated
plantation spread over an area of 5000 acres, and are well protected35. Plantation is also
raised by community in irrigated plantations and on farm- land. Irrigated plantations are
limited to about 298 hectares in Lasbela, Sibi, Zhob, Pishin and Quetta districts. In Naseer
Abad and Sibi districts, plantations irrigates with water from the Pat Feeder and Kirthar
canals and from Nari River. In other areas, they depend on water from tube-wells 36.

Deforestation
About three percent of Balochistan has been gazetted state forests 37. Major parts (70-80
percent) of the state forests are grass and shrubs. The remaining state forests are
sparse to open coniferous wood, riverain forests in the Sibi – Kachhi Plain and widely
scattered shrubs. In state forests, green trees and wildlife are protected under the
forests and wildlife regulations 38. Exploitation rights (fuel-wood, grazing, fruit collection)
as well as employment rights are specifically included in the notification of each state
forest area. Several state forests have been destroyed due to settlement of Afghan
Refugees, e.g. Popalzai Jungle. In Kalat district partly juniper, partly Pistacia and Olive
wood forests are under degradation. Juniper forests in Ziarat are in very poor
conditions. Many trees show signs of lopping for fodder and debarking for roofing. The
juniper woods are often the only source of fuel-wood in the cold winter and timber
supply for house construction over vast areas in the province with poor and rapidly
growing population 39. Mangroves in the coastal area are exploited for fuel wood and
forage due to scarcity of other trees in coastal belt.

Wetlands
Balochistan has few worlds’ finest wetland habitats. They attract a variety of waterfowl,
including swans, geese, ducks, grebes, herons and several species of waders. Zangi Nawar
Lake in Chagai District is a wetland of international importance. More than 60,000 birds
counted there in the mid-1980s40. However, it dries during drought years such as 1987,
1999 and 2000. Spin Karez, wetland near Quetta, is a site for migratory, breeding and
watering waterfowl species. Hanna Lake was developed as recreational sites in Quetta
district, also attract some waterfowl i n winter. Siranda Lake in Lasbela district is famous for
attracting a large number of common shelduck. The Biroon Kirthar Canal in Jaffer Abad
district is habitat to large number of mallards, pintails, widgeons and coots. Grey herons and
egrets are abundant on this site. Other important wetlands include mangrove forests in
sheltered bays on the coast, Pasni Bay and Hab Reservoir.

Diversions of surface runoff for agriculture have an impact on the functioning of
wetlands. Without an adequate input of fresh water, the quality of wetlands and associated
habitats deteriorate, as well as the mangrove forests that fringe three estuaries along the
coast. Reservoirs and canals have greatly enriched the habitat and wildlife populations of
the province. Some of these lost most of their storage capacity over time, due to siltation.
Presently, there is no sufficient water to irrigate hardly 200 hectares41. Once an important
breeding and staying area for birds, the reservoir is dry for most of the year and is being
encroached by orchards and settlements.

Biodiversity degradation
Game animals in the province have been on decline because of unsustainable hunting, food
and furs. Universal netting and capitulating of birds has lead to sharp decline of some

species or even some of these became extinct. Habitat destruction due to land use changes
is another cause of decline in wildlife. Amongst migratory birds the Hobart Bustard, Cranes
and falcons have suffered to great extent42. Some of the animals found in Balochistan such
as Leopard, Asiatic Cheetah, Wolf, Balochistan Black Bear, Chiltan Markhor and Straight
Horned Markhor are listed in the International Red Data Book of IUCN.

The proposed project activities in the project area may not pose any direct threats to the
wildlife habitat; however, biodiversity is generally recognized as conservation target all over
the world. Annex-B, list the ecologically protected areas43 comprising wildlife sanctuaries,
national parks, and game reserves as conservation targets in Balochistan province. The total
area protected and conserved is approximately 44,500.23 hectares.


4.11 Demographic Profile
Balochistan has clustered population and is smallest in proportion as compared to that of
other provinces. Its estimated current population is 8.912 million, having a density of 23
persons per square kilometer with an average growth rate of 2.47 percent per annum. The
fertility rate is approximately 4.08 percent. With the existing growth rate, the population is
expected to double in 30 years. The Preliminary Census Report 2012 indicates that the
population of province has increased up to 13.162 million44 (yet to be officially verified). The
main languages in the province are Balochi (40 percent), Pashto (40 percent) and Brahui (20
percent). Additionally, there are a small number of Persian speakers (in the capital Quetta)
and Sindhi (mostly in parts of Lasbela)45. The population density46 in the project area
including 12 districts is given Table-9. Jaferabad district followed by Naseerabad, Pishin,
Bolan and Kalat district is comparatively densely populated than other districts of the project
area. Overall gender ratio in these districts (males per 100 females) ranges 107 to 119.47

4.12 Agricultural and Livestock’s Production
About 6 percent of the available land is currently being cultivated in Balochistan, mostly in
small landholdings. Agriculture is the mains stay of the economy and employs 67 percent of
the total work- force. Approximately 60 percent of cultivated land is under dry land farming.
Orchards in the upland valleys produce the highest returns. The production of orchards
per unit of land fetches three to four times the income of grain or vegetable crops48. At
intermediate elevations (500–1,500 metres) where there is perennial water and a
marketing infrastructure, farmers can produce off-season vegetable crops that command
a premium price in major urban areas. In valleys above 1,500 metres, farmers can obtain
significant returns from fruit production if irrigation water is available49.

Wheat is the most important crop grown in highlands of the province, followed by barley and
rapeseed. In spite of potentially high yield of barley, wheat predominates because it provides
food security. In addition, the local wheat varieties used in Balochistan yields good quantity of

straw and stubble; livestock’s mostly small ruminants graze the latter50. Onion, potato,
Fodder, Gram and Cotton are also grown in some areas depending upon the availability of
water for irrigation purposes.

Balochistan is the major producer of deciduous fruits and contribute about 70 percent of the
total deciduous fruit production of the country. The varied nature and aridity of climate
enables the province to produce a wide range of temperate and tropical fruits & vegetables
in a comparatively disease free environment. A large number of people are engaged in Fruit
Farming in the province. Agriculture contributes 52 percent to GDP and employs 65 percent
(either full or part-time) of the labor force. Balochistan’s diverse climate and topography
create unique opportunities for agriculture (e.g., horticulture), but access to water is a key
constraint. Rainfall is generally very low and uncertain, particularly in the upland areas that
dominate the province. The rugged landscape and lack of water render much of
Balochistan’s land area unsuitable for agriculture. Only about 17 percent is arable and a
majority of that is not cultivated, primarily because of a lack of water. Even the huge
uncultivable area is largely unproductive with only about 30 percent offering good grazing for
livestock51.

Livestock is also an important component of Balochistan agriculture system. The province’s
rangelands support as many as 22 million sheep and goats, although the exact number is
difficult to determine because of the nomadic lifestyle of many herders. Livestock is an
important source of income for many households in rural Balochistan. Livestock accounts for
as much as 36 percent of the value of agricultural products and contributes substantially to
livelihoods52.

The rangelands of the province provide as much as 85 to 95 percent of the feed for its
numerous livestock. The range is controlled by the tribes and suffers from the degradation
typical of common property resources. The recent drought has exacerbated the problem,
reducing the yield of range forage from 60 kg per hectare to 18 kg per hectare and putting
additional pressure on households53.

Drought
Balochistan is suffering from a prolonged drought that has significantly affected agriculture,
environment and livelihoods Rainfall has been below normal in the past several years. A
survey conducted by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) in 2001 identified
a number of consequences of the drought in Balochistan. These included a reduction in
household income, greater dependence on other income sources, migration to other areas
for work, and an increased burden on women to provide income and to fetch water and food
from greater distances. The survey concluded that the drought had reduced yields on an
average of 78 percent of farmers’ rain-fed lands and 38 percent of their irrigated lands In
addition to crops; the survey estimated a 76 percent reduction in livestock numbers in the
province between 1997 and 200154. Availability of water is the ultimate problem throughout
the province including the project area of the proposed PGEB project.

4.13 Healthcare Facilities
Balochistan has a very scattered population where the health facilities are limited and
sanitation facilities are inadequate. The far-flung rural and the semi-urbanized slums faces
the dilemma of the usual infections and viral attacks, which causes fatality for them.
Balochistan has been rated high for the infant and mother mortality during the pregnancies.
The health services are highly concentrated and centralized at the capital of the province, all
the professional physicians, surgeons and specialists are gathered in Quetta, while there
exists no reasonable human resource at the out skirts of the province.

Due to lack of social and physical infrastructures, the province is suffering from severe
backwardness. Every sector of economy is undeveloped and under-developed including the
health sector and primary health care services are minimal. The main reason for scarcity of
health care services are; lack of qualified doctors and nurses, lack of hospitals and referral
health services, lack of equipments in hospitals and non availability of preventive and
curative medicines in public health facilities. The availability of qualified doctors in hospitals
is a very serious issue in all districts except major hospitals. The total number of public
sector hospitals in Balochistan55 are 122 with bed strength of 5822, Dispensaries are 584
with bed strength of 45, Rural Health Centre (RHC) are 85 with bed strength of 974 and
Basic Health Units are 551 and 92 MCH Centers. A number of hospitals working in private
sectors especially in Quetta fulfill the health care demands of the middle and higher middle
class families56.

Balochistan province lacks the required health care facilities and trained professionals.
There are total 3211 qualified doctors and 662 nurses, 139 pharmacists, 410 Lady Health
Visitors, and 1304 Midwives in public sector hospitals in the province57. About 328 private
medical practitioners and 97 female private medical practitioners are also providing health
care services mostly in the capital city. Details of district wise health facilities in the project
area are given in Table-10.

The infant mortality rates recorded in the province ranges from 78 to 121 is generally higher
than accepted international standards and health indicators present a dismal status of the
province58. Awareness about personal hygiene is very low. According to the MICS59 survey
only 41 percent household’s use soap to wash their hands before eating and only 55 percent
wash their hands adequately after attending toilet. Only 52 percent households are aware of
the need for iodized salt.

4.14 Education Facilities
The educational facilities in the province range from primary level schools up-to universities
and specialized institutions such as technical and vocational institutions. The province has
total 12281 schools out of which 10637 are primary schools, 953 middle schools and 594
high schools, and 97 inter and degree colleges60. Out of the total educational facilities, 8886
are male and 3395 are female. Public sector enrolments at primary level are 822596, at

middle level 118304, at high school level 15184, and at higher secondary school level 1672.
Enrolments by gender in public sector schools in the province stand at 60 percent for boys
and 40 percent for girls. The number of school in selected 12 districts of the project are
6775, out of which 5929 are primary level schools, 529 middle level schools and 286 are
high level schools and 31 are inter & degree schools. The percentage share of boys and
girls schools in the project area stands at 71 percent for boys and 29 percent for girls.
Details of the schools in the project districts are listed in Table-11.

The combined literacy rate in the province is 37 percent. While male literacy rate is 52
percent and female literacy rate is 19 percent in Balochistan61. Findings of the Multiple
Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) on “literacy among young women of age 15-24 years?, show
that around 33 percent of young women in the province were found literate on the basis of
“ability to read a short simple statement?. Further, women in the younger cohort had higher
literacy levels at 35 percent than those in the next age bracket (30 percent) meaning that
literacy rate has improved by 4 percent in the recent past62. Young women in urban areas
had a much higher literacy rate to the tune of 59 percent than those residing in the rural
areas at 23 percent.

Literacy rate by regions show variation ranging from as low as 16 percent in Zhob region to
as high as 69 percent in Makran region; understanding the dynamics of these variations in
terms of access to schools, institutional arrangements, and poverty levels in various regions.
The relationship between literacy and poverty in terms of wealth quintiles is also very
alarming; only 7.5 percent women in the poorest wealth quintile and 16.6 percent in next
upper quintile were literate compared to 67 percent in the richest quintile63. This finding
indicates that public sector expenditure on education is poorly targeted on poorest of the
poor.

4.15 Infrastructure Profile
The infrastructure in Balochistan varies from urban to rural areas as well as in different
regions of the province. The roads networks in the province comprise of approximately 32046
km including 11826 km black topped roads and 20220 km shingle roads64reflecting p o o r
connectivity in the province. The largest expansion in roads network was that of farm-to-
markets roads. The length of the national highways remained largely constant at 2,371 km.
Poor connectivity and access continue to be a major problem, which particularly affect
the poor, who live mostly in the rural areas. Shingle or gravel roads representing 77
percent of the network is in very poor condition and deteriorating rapidly owing to
increased traffic and insufficient maintenance65. The length of road network (in kilometres) in
the project districts is given in Table-12.

4.16 Socio-economic Conditions
Balochistan is relatively scarce in its endowments of human capital, agricultural growth and
industrial investment comparing with rest of the provinces. For the last fifteen years, the
overall share of Balochistan in the national GDP has remained constant at 4 percent. In the

service sectors Balochistan’s growth potential appears to be closely connected to its
integration with the national economy and other regional economies66. Agriculture, both
crops and livestock, is the main income generator as well as employment sector in
Balochistan. Agriculture accounts for about 65 percent of GDP and employ about 65 percent
of the workforce full or part time67.

While agriculture continues a source of growth, its relative potential in Balochistan is
circumscribed by the chronic scarcity of water over much of the province. The irrigated
Kachhi plains account for a high proportion of all crop production. Livestock and horticulture
dominate the agricultural sector in the rest of the province. Persistent droughts and chronic
water scarcity has meant the loss of grazing land, and hence reduction in livestock’s sector.
Only one third of the total land of the province can be deemed reasonably productive grazing
land68.

Conditions for manufacturing growth are relatively unfavorable compared with the rest of
Pakistan. Mineral sector is a potentially significant but as yet under-developed sector in
Balochistan’s economy. Currently 5 percent of GDP is earned through mining and employs
only about 1.3 per cent of the employed persons in the province. Extraction of thirty-nine out
of the fifty recorded mineral resources present in Balochistan generates annual revenue of
close to Rs.3.4 billion.

Fisheries are significant in the economy of the small coastal towns, but not so far the GDP.
Fisheries sector contributed to 9 percent of the national fisheries sector in 2004-2005. The
catch is supplied to domestic and international markets through Karachi and Turbat. The
fisheries sector is also a source of employment for many in the coastal areas. Nearly 70
percent of the total employed persons in the coastal districts are associated with the
fisheries sector69.

Human Development Index (HDI) ranking of districts for the province indicate highest for
Panjgur to the lowest for Musakhel. Districts Panjgur (0.553), Gwadar (0.543), Kech (0.521),
Ziarat (0.467), Sibi (0.459), Chagai (0.416), Quetta Zarghoon (0.410), Pishin (0.408) and
Jafar Abad (0.405) fall in the highest (first) category. On the contrary, districts with terribly
low HDI values include; Kachhi (0.289), Kalat (0.282), Awaran (0.278), Zhob (0.271), Kharan
(0.267), Washuk (0.265), Khuzdar (0.259), Sherani (0.255), Loralai (0.243) and Musakhel
(0.193)70.

Education and Social Issues:
Balochistan has the worst education outcomes among the four provinces in Pakistan. Girls
education is a particular challenge due to a combination of deficiencies in education service
provision and demand side failures. The supply side challenges consist of lack of adequate
schools for girls at each level of schooling, poor facilities in schools, lower rate of enrolment
and lack of teaching staff. These factors hinder access to education for girls feeding into a
lower literacy rate for girls.

On the demand side, social issues and challenges exert an influence on girls access to
education. Foremost among these are patriarchal structure of society and the prevailing
conflict situation. Patriarchal structures place restrictions on the mobility of girls, confine
them to specific household related roles at an early stage of life and place lower value on
their education. The impact of these factors is evident from a lower NER for girls indicating a
larger number of out-of-school girls, higher drop-out rate for girls especially at primary level
and lower number of girls completing school education. The situation is further influenced by
the prevailing conflict that places further hindrances in both school operation and girls
access to schools.

Given this situation, the Project will need to work in close collaboration with local
communities to ensure that the establishment of schools does not contribute to any
environmental and other social issues that can alienate it. It is essential to build a solid
foundation with communities and eliminate and possible sources of conflict, nuisance and
hazard to ensure that acceptance for girls schooling is promoted

4.17 Culture, Religion, and Customs
Balochistan has a very rich cultural heritage of ancient times reflected through specimens of
art and craft, literature, and architect. The population is predominantly of Muslims but
minorities populations of Hindu’s, Sikh and Christian lives in urban and rural areas. Pashto,
Balochi and Brahui are the native languages spoken widely, particularly in rural areas.
However, in Kachhi and Sibi districts, people speak Seraiki and Sindhi. Quetta city, the
confluence point of all linguistic groups accommodates not only Urdu, Balochi, Pashto,
Brahvi and Sindhi speaking people but Punjabi, Darri and Persian speaking people as well.
Majority of the population understand and speak Urdu, the national language.

A strong tribal system exist with number of tribes constitute to make people of Balochistan.
Three major tribes are Baloch, Pashtoon and Brahvi. The Balochi speaking tribes include
Rind, Lashar, Marri, Jamot, Ahmedzai, Bugti Domki, Magsi, Khosa, Rakhashani, Dashti,
Umrani, Nosherwani, Gichki, Buledi, Sanjarani and Khidai. Each tribe is further sub-divided
into various branches. The tribal chief is called Sardar while head of sub-tribe is known as
Malik, Takari or Mir. Sardars and Maliks are members of district and other local Jirga's
according to their status. The Balochi, are further divided in to two branches: the Sulemani
and Mekrani as distinct from the Brahvis who mostly concentrate in central Balochistan.
Among the eighteen major Balochi tribes, Bugtis and Marris are the principal ones who are
settled in the buttresses of the Sulemania. Brahvi speaking tribes include Raisani, Shahwani,
Sumulani, Bangulzai, Mohammad Shahi, Lehri, Bezenjo, Mohammad Hasni, Zehri, Mengal
and Lango, most of these tribes are bi-lingual and are quite fluent both in the Balochi and
Brahvi Languages. The Pashtoon tribes include Kakar, Ghilzai Tareen, Mandokhel, Sherani,
Luni, Kasi and Achakzai71

Cultural landscape of Balochistan72 portrays various ethnic groups. Though people speak
different languages, there is a similarity in their literature, beliefs, moral order and customs.
The cementing factor is religion which provides a base for unity and common social order.

Brahvi, Balochi and Pashtoon tribes are known for their hospitality. Another adorable feature
of Balochistan culture is faithfulness and sincerity in all relationships. There is no place or
respect for unfaithful people in prevalent moral order. If fidelity is reciprocated with disloyalty
or betrayal it is never forgotten.

Peoples dress among the Balochi, Pashtoon and Brahvi tribes is very similar having a few
minor dissimilarities. Turban is the common headwear of the men. Wide loose shalwar and
knee-long shirts are worn by all. The dress of the woman consists of the typical shirt having
embroidery work with embedded small round mirror pieces. Big ‘Dopatta’ or ‘Chaddar’, a
long rectangular piece of cloth cascading down the shoulders and used to cover head, are
used by the women.

The religious and social festivals are celebrated by the people of Balochistan. Besides,
major religious festivals, colorful social festivals are also source of jubilation. Sibi festival that
traces its roots to Mehergar, an archeological site of ancient human civilization, attracts
people from across the country. It is attended by common folks, ministers and other
government officials. Folk music performance, cultural dances, handicrafts stalls, cattle
shows and a number of other amusing activities present a perfect riot of color. Buzkashi is a
peculiar festival showing velour of Balochistan people. It is celebrated on horse-back by two
teams that use their skills to snatch a goat from the each other.

5.4     Outcome of Consultations:
A brief summary of the outcomes of stakeholder consultations is given below:

Education Department
The Education Department Officials were briefed on the purpose and scope of ESIA study.
Necessary information about the project, project areas and organisational set up of PGEB
project was provided by the Education Department. The Additional Secretary Education
Department Government of Balochistan gave detailed briefing on the project and modus
operandi of PGEB and institutional set up for implementation of project activities. The
Director Education Department expressed concern over the issue of lake of resources and
capacity of education department for monitoring of the environmental and social aspects of
the project.


                                                                                                52
EPA Balochistan
The Director (EIA), Balochistan EPA was apprised of the project, its scope and the purpose
of ESIA study. He appreciated that Environmental and social assessment of the project is
being conducted which is legal obligation under the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act,
1997 and said that EPA will facilitate the project in achieving the objective of environment
protection in the province.

The Deputy Director (legal), EPA Balochistan informed that all projects are being scrutinised
for EIA requirement and action are taken against those who do not comply with PEPA, 1997.
He also shared the progress of cases referred to Environmental Courts and Tribunal in
Balochistan.

Stakeholder Workshop and FGDs
Majority of the stakeholders appreciated the PGEB project initiatives and said that education
infrastructure facilities are not sufficient in province and the project should be extended to
other areas and districts as well. However, some showed concern over the execution of
project activities in southern districts because of security consideration in the area

Some of the education department officials expressed concern and resentment for having
not been involved in the project designing stage and decision-making process, wherein they
could have offered workable options. Majority of the stakeholder interviewed suggested
having strong monitoring and evaluation mechanism to ensure that the benefits of project
reach to the poor and vulnerable communities

The stakeholders agreed that unsuitable land sites such as flood prone area and steep
slopes land shall be avoided because it would leads to increase vulnerability of children’s to
disasters. They also stress the need for standard quality construction to avoid such risks e.g.
earthquake and floods;

In the opinion of majority stakeholders, open defecation in and around the school causes
health hygiene problem in the area, preventive, and mitigation measures should be taken to
address the problem. They agreed that proper site selection and designing of school should
be done to accommodate future expansion and easy access to schools. Some persons
showed concerns over inadequate arrangements for water supply and wastewater drainage
in schools that lead to health hygiene problems;

Provision of proper waste disposal/dumping facility is required in all schools to avoid health
hygiene problems. The health and hygiene issues are more dependent on schoolteachers
and, therefore, schoolteacher training on health hygiene is necessary to implement in
schools.

Most of the stakeholder expressed concern over the non-availability of drinking water in
schools and suggested that proper storage of water is necessary in all schools for drinking
as well as plantation and cleanliness.

The local community stress the need to strengthen the roles and responsibilities of PTSMCs
in school management and operation and to strengthen the capacity of Education

                                                                                            53
Department for more proactive role in the project implementation and monitoring. The NGOs
working on education in the project area expressed concern over the non- availability of
authentic data regarding the number of schools and enrolments of students and suggested
that Education Department should develop a databank all schools in each district to avoid
duplication of efforts.




                                                                                      54
                        6. ANALYSIS OF PROJECT ALTERNATIVES
This chapter describes various project alternatives considered during the study in order to
ensure that the best possible option in terms of environmental, social and economic has
been included in the design. Following is the brief description of alternative options
considered during this study.

6.1    No Project Option
Pakistan faces serious challenges in ensuring good quality education to all. Literacy rate is
barely 50 per cent, with that for females being 35 per cent. About 6.8 million primary school
age children’s are out of school. Primary education completion rate is 70 per cent for male
and 53 per cent for females. The Primary Gender Parity Index rests at 0.78. The quality of
education remains equally problematic (UNESCO 2009)73.

The challenges to ensuring good quality education to all are compounded by the fact that
disparities in access continue to be significant across the four provinces and across income,
gender, and urban/rural divide. There are great disparities in access among the four
provinces, plus there are high variations in rural-urban education indicators. A large
proportion of the literate population is concentrated in the national and provincial capitals.
The areas with low literacy are also backward in terms of economic development. Punjab
being the most populated province hosts the largest number of state schools, while
Balochistan hosts the smallest (Table-13). Literacy rate is highest in Sindh at 56 per cent
and lowest in Balochistan at 37 per cent. This inter-provincial difference is pronounced in
literacy rates among females: as opposed to a female literacy rate of 44 per cent in Punjab,
in Balochistan the rate is only 19 per cent (Table-14)74. Further, there is great variation in
performance across the rural and urban areas within each province and across males and
females. The Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) is as high as 111 per cent in urban areas of
Punjab while it is as low as 41 per cent in the rural areas of Balochistan (Table-15)75.

During stakeholder consultations, the people expressed a sense of deprivation in socio-
economic development while comparing themselves with other provinces. Realising this
genuine concern of the people of Balochistan, the Federal Government announced a special
package called “Balochistan Development Package?. Keeping in view the aforementioned
situation, no project option neither is in line with the Government policy nor will be feasible
alternatives given the socio-economic profile of the province. No project option will further
add insult to the injury by depriving the local populace of this tremendous opportunity,
particularly female segment of the society from education with grave consequences in terms
of social, environmental and economic impacts.

6.2 Sites Alternatives
The best environmental management measure for construction of schools is to select the
site in such location that the students are provided with an atmosphere that is
environmentally safe, healthy and conducive for learning. For 130 shelter less schools and
about 200 schools proposed for construction, rehabilitation and provision of missing facilities

                                                                                                                          55
sites have already been selected and in case of missing facilities a basic building structure is
already constructed. Therefore, the site alternative option is not relevant for these schools.
For the 150 gender free government schools with community participation construction is not
envisaged during the project duration. In prioritizing of school selection shelter less and
community schools in rural areas the following options are suggested:
    a) Land located on hilly terrain
    b) Land located in flood plain
    c) Waste or communal land in remote area.
    d) Readymade building donated by community.

The adverse environmental and social impacts likely to arise from the site selection are
given below:
    a) Sites located on hilly terrain and steep slopes could lead to soil erosion, land-sliding
       during construction, excavation and accessibility problems for schools kids.
    b) Sites located in flood plains increases the risk of health and safety issues for schools
       kids and damage to properties.
    c) Site location on waste or communal land in remote area could lead to social disputes
       among the community and accessibility issues for schools kids.
    d) The readymade buildings provided by community usually does not have the required
       water storage arrangement, toilets and sanitation facilities which leads to water
       pollution, health and hygiene problems in the surrounding areas.

The identification and selection of sites for schools will be undertaken when the project starts
and the Education Department, Balochistan invites applications from interested communities
for space availability for running a school till the time the school is stable. Assessment and
selection of proper siting will be carried out by the Education Department.

In order to select environmentally feasible sites for the prioritizing schools for construction
following site selection guidelines have been proposed which will be followed by the
Education Department for the construction of shelter less schools.

6.2.1 Site Selection guidelines
The proposed project will construct about 130 shelters less schools. The following guidelines
will be followed to select environmental friendly sites and locations for the proposed schools.
     1. Sites for the schools will not be located on the edge of main roads and highways.
         While selecting site at least 50 meters distance will be maintained between the
         boundary wall of the proposed school and the edge of the carriageway to reduce the
         risks of accidents.
     2. Un-drained and saline soils will be avoided as much as possible in selection of sites.
         If no alternate site is available, in such cases appropriate construction techniques will
         be applied to ensure that the building structure is protected from corrosion, moisture
         and salinity.
     3. Sites close to stream and rivers, critical wildlife habitats, forested area will not be
         selected for the schools.
     4. Sites close to any high voltage power line or large wastes dumps or sites prone to
         landslides and natural disasters will be avoided.



                                                                                               56
      5.    Sites for girls schools shall not be located in difficult terrain ad very far away from
           the population to ensure easy access and easement to the girls students and
           teachers.

6.3    Design Alternatives
The following designs alternatives were considered based on social, environmental and
economic impacts.
       a) Introducing second shift in schools
       b) Changing existing design of buildings
       c) Improving existing design of buildings
       d) Introducing eco-friendly designs in new construction

Introducing second shift in the existing schools is an environmentally sound alternative for
increasing student enrollment rate. However, this alternative restricts the right of education
to certain segment of population where schools already exist and will culminate in to
increased social disparities and de-fragmentation amongst the people. The advantageous
groups (where schools exist) will get more advantage while the dis-advantaged peoples
(without access to schools) living in the poorest and remote areas will be deprived from their
basic right of education and hence the project will not achieve the desired objectives in terms
of social equity and justice.

Changing the existing design of schools involves demolition and dismantling of existing
schools which will create not only environmental issues such as soil and water
contamination from disposal of demolition wastes but will also lead to social issues such as
disruption in studies of students. Also the reconstruction of existing buildings would require
additional funding and hence not an economically feasible option.

Improvement and modification of the existing designs will not have any major environmental
and social impacts as the schools are already operational in the existing buildings. Minor
environmental issues such as dust emission, wastewater discharge and construction wastes
generated from construction of additional class rooms, toilets, boundary walls, water storage
tanks etc in the existing buildings are easily manageable by adopting appropriate mitigation
measures, beside, being an economically feasible alternative.

The construction of new eco-friendly building designs for shelter less schools is another
design alternative. The construction of new buildings could provide an opportunity to create
a building facility that meet the needs of the students in a more efficient and effective
manner. The new buildings will also provide opportunity for future expansion and would be
more energy efficient building with minimum operational costs.

6.4        Technological alternatives
The following technological alternatives were considered for construction of new eco-friendly
buildings.
      i) Cemented structure
      ii) Pre-fabricated structures
      iii) Kacha mud structures




                                                                                                      57
Kacha mud structures are the cheapest available option for construction of buildings;
however, such buildings are unsafe particularly in the flood plain and earthquake prone
areas. Hence, this option was rejected on the basis of health and safety consideration of
children.

The construction of prefabricated structures with cemented foundation was also considered
for shelter less school in the project area. Prefab structures have been used for schools in
the earthquake affected area of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. However, prefabricated
structures are not only a costly option but also climatically not suitable in the summer plain
areas. These structures also create environmental issues such as low ventilation and
lighting, vibration of prefab structure and the use of insulation materials (sometime asbestos)
and painting may pose health hazards for the children. The social acceptability of pre-
fabricated structures is another issues associated with this option. Hence this option was
also rejected.

Cemented structures with reinforced concrete and stone or bricks masonry is the best
alternative option for the construction of environmental friendly buildings. The environmental
parameters such as ventilation, lighting and heating inside the building can be taken care off
through appropriate designing.

Cemented structures with reinforced concrete are the most commonly used designs;
climatically suitable, economically feasible and socially acceptable to the local communities
and, therefore, recommended for the proposed project.

6.5      Technological Options for Toilets
The following technological options were considered for the construction of toilets in the
existing as well as new buildings for the schools in the project area:
    i. Pour Flush Toilet
    ii. Dry Pit Toilets
    iii. Compost Toilets;
    iv. Eco-San Toilets

Pour flush toilets with septic tank require large quantity of water for cleaning and generate
wastewater. Proper sanitation and drainage facility is required for wastewater discharge from
these toilets. The design is not suitable for water scarce areas because it requires sufficient
quantity of water for flushing and cleaning the human excreta.

In dry pit toilets tissue paper is used for anal cleaning and no water is required for flushing.
The human excreta go down into a dry pit constructed below the pan. Dry pit toilets are
suitable for water scarce areas, however, the availability of tissue/toilet paper must be
ensured all the time otherwise, these toilets could be source of health problem. During
stakeholder consultations the local community also expressed their reservations about the
education department capability to provide tissue paper to the school children and, therefore,
this design was not recommended for school.

Compost Toilet is another alternative considered for the proposed project. The compost toilet
comprises a raised slab over two chambers. The chambers are built on the ground and are
plastered with cement internally in order to waterproof them and make compost removal

                                                                                             58
tidier. The chambers are designed to have an accumulation time of about nine months to
allow thorough composting of the contents and elimination of pathogens. The compost
produced is an almost dry, crumbly, black product having a light, earthy odour. The compose
toilet require removal of finished product frequently which is an unpleasant job. Compost
toilet does not require water for flushing, and thus, reduce water consumption.

Eco-San toilet is a more advanced version of the compost toilet in which urine is diverted at
source by a specially designed pedestal and led into a shallow soak pit. Faeces are
deposited in a shallow vault and covered with a sprinkling of ash or dry soil, which absorbs
most of the moisture. They are further subjected to a dehydration process inside the vault,
which hastens pathogen die-off. Depending on the temperature and degree of desiccation
attained in the vault, the residue can then be easily removed from the vault biannually or
annually and either disposed of or re-used as soil conditioner. These toilets are suitable for
water scarce, coastal and rocky areas. A schematic diagram of the UD-type toilet is given in
Exhibit-5

The initial cost of investment is comparatively higher (double) than the other alternatives.
However, due to water scarcity in the project area, Eco-san toilet is an environmentally
suitable design for the proposed new schools building, although the initial capital cost may
be slightly higher than other available options. Eco-San toilets are widely used in water
scarce areas of Bangladesh, Nepal, China, India and in the earthquake affected areas of
Pakistan.

6.6      Management Options
The construction of new buildings and provision of missing facilities in the existing buildings
for schools under the PGEB project is a major project activity. Following management
options were considered for the construction of new school buildings keeping in view its
environmental and social considerations:
    i. Construction through Government
    ii. Construction through NGOs/Community
    iii. Construction through a Private Engineering Firm.

The Government carries out construction work through the Construction and Works (C&W)
Department which is a mandated department for this purpose. The C&W Department hires
private contractors through competitive bidding process. Following are main issues
associated with this option are: i) lengthy process leading to delays in the completion of
work; ii) quality of work is usually not satisfactory due to weak monitoring by C&W; iii) the
contractor usually do not care to implement environmental and social mitigation measures
for profit maximization; iv) The low quality of buildings leads to compromising the health and
safety of school children. On the basis of environmental and social consideration,
Government construction is not a suitable option for the proposed project.

NGOs construction through community participation is another alternative considered for the
project. However, the NGOs does not have any permanent infrastructure set up required for
construction work and hence charge high overhead costs for hiring equipments and
machinery from the local market on project to project basis.

Construction through a certified private construction firm will ensure to: i) complete the
construction work within the stipulated timelines; ii) ensure quality of work; iii) implement
environmental and social mitigation measures across the board in all schools. The

                                                                                            59
implementation of construction work through a qualified private construction firm is thus a
recommended management option for the PGEB project.

   7. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION MEASURES
This section describes the potential impacts of the project activities on physical, biological,
and socio-economic environment and measures for their mitigations. The potentially adverse
environmental impacts have been discussed with respect to the site/design, construction,
and operation stage of schools. Necessary mitigation measures have been proposed for
avoiding or rectifying the adverse impacts.

7.1      Impact Assessment and Mitigation Strategy
The environmental and social impacts of project activities were assessed employing a
simplified impact assessment matrix ( Table-16) which was tailored according to the specific
needs of the PGEB project. The project activities included construction of shelter less
school, establishment of new schools with community participation and providing missing
facilities such as room and boundary wall construction, toilets, water supply facilities,
operation and maintenance. The potential environmental impacts from these activities on
physical, biological, and socio-economic environment, thus predicted were characterised as
following:
      ? High negative (adverse) impact (-2),
      ? Low negative impact (-1)
      ? Insignificant impact,(0)
      ? High positive (beneficial) impact (+2),
      ? Low positive impact (+1), and
      ? No impact (N)


Some of the key environmental and social impacts likely to occur during site selection,
construction and operation stages are listed below;
Environmental impacts:
    Soil erosion
    Surface water contamination
    Soil contamination
    Air quality deterioration
    Loss of vegetation and trees
Social impacts:
    Noise and vibrations
    Health and hygiene problems
    Water resources depletion
    Loss to agriculture land

In order to minimize these impacts, mitigation measures have been proposed. The mitigation
strategy adopted in this study follow the following principles:
     Firstly, avoiding the impacts by appropriate site selection, eco-friendly designing
        and adopting environmental friendly construction practices

    Secondly reducing and rectifying the impacts by adopting and implementing the
     proposed mitigation measures and guidelines

    Thirdly, enhancing the capacities of concerned department and officers to carry out
     monitoring and mid-course corrections to ensure long-term environmental and
     social sustainability of the project

                                                                                            62
7.2     Impacts on physical environment
7.2.1 Soil and lands
The potential environmental impacts of project activities on soil and land during site
selection, designing, construction and operation stages are following:
Site selection stage
     Improper site selection of schools can lead to soil erosion.
Construction stage
     Excavations for construction particularly in the hilly terrain of district Loralai, Khuzdar,
        Panjgur, Kalat Lasbela and Pishin, can destabilize the land and may lead to soil
        erosion and land sliding.
     Disposal of contaminated construction wastes can lead to soil contamination.
     The borrow pits may lead to soil degradation and erosion.
     Disposal of left over construction material and excavated soil can lead to soil
        contamination.
Operation stage
     Open discharge of toilet wastewater to the adjacent lands can contaminate the soil
        and degrade the quality of land.

7.2.2 Mitigation for impacts on soil and land
Siting and design
     Appropriate site selection and designing for school will be done according to the
        guidelines provided in Section 6.2.1 in order to entail no or minimal disturbance to the
        soil and land.
Construction Stage
     Removal of vegetation and trees will be avoided to the extent possible. In case of
        unavoidable circumstances the exposed soil will be re-vegetated quickly and
        compensatory plantation, (five trees for each one removed), will be carried out after
        construction is over.
     The contractor will ensure the prevention of soil erosion and destabilization by
        employing batched excavation technique.
     Diggings, if required for foundation, will be carried out only in specified area, as per
        the engineering drawings and excavated earth material will be used for filling and
        compaction.
     Tree plantation will be carried out, around the periphery of school building, through
        community participation to enhance soil stability and control erosion
     Borrow pits will be restored and levelled back to control soil degradation
     Left over construction materials and excavated soil will be disposed off in designated
        areas to avoid soil contamination/land degradation.
Operation Stage
     A secure sewer line from school building will be provided to the local sewerage
        system, if available. Alternately, an appropriately sized septic tank and soaking pit
        will be constructed for sewage disposal.

7.2.3 Impacts on surface water resources
Site and designing
     Site selection of schools close to the streams and rivers can cause water quality
       degradation and contamination of surface water resources (Fig. 32).

                                                                                               63
      Improper design of schools without toilets and sewage disposal system or septic tank
       can lead to degradation of surface water quality in the surrounding areas.

Construction Stage
      Water withdrawal may deplete the water source. Disposal of contaminated water can
       pollute a water source
Operation Stage
    Open discharge of toilet wastewater into a surface water body (stream, river, and
       canal) without treatment, during operation phase can deteriorate recipient body’s
       water quality.

7.2.4 Mitigation for surface water resources impacts
Siting and design
     Site close to stream and river will not be selected for the proposed school. In case of
        unavoidable choice, the school design will include wastewater treatment and disposal
        arrangements.
     Particularly in water scarce areas, low water-consumption designs will be employed
        for toilets. Rainwater harvesting will also be included in the design.
Construction Stage
     Minimum quantity of water shall be use to meet the essential construction
        requirements. The contractor will ensure to avoid unnecessary use of water for
        washing of equipments and vehicles during construction.
     The contractor will dispose the construction wastewater from the work site through a
        soaking pit of appropriate capacity, which be levelled back after completion of
        construction work. For toilet waste, appropriate arrangements such as septic tanks
        with soaking pits will be arranged.
Operation Stage
     Regular maintenance of the septic tank and sewer line will be carried out for safe
        disposal of toilet wastewater during school operation.
     PTSMC will monitor the operation of sewerage system during schooling hours.
     The local community will be sensitised through health and hygiene sessions to
        protect the water resources from contamination.

7.2.5 Impacts on groundwater resources
Site and design
     Site selection does not pose any direct threats to the groundwater contamination.
     The location of toilet close to hand pump or tube well may increase vulnerability of
       contamination.
Construction Stage
     The construction stage activities do not pose any direct threat to ground water
       contamination.
Operation Stage
     Stagnation of the spilled water around the base of hand pump or tube well can lead
       to its downward movement along the well and therefore likelihood of groundwater
       contamination during school operation.



                                                                                          64
7.2.6 Mitigation for groundwater resources impacts
Design stage
     The location of toilet will not be close to the hand pump or tube well or any other
       ground water source to avoid seepage and contamination of well water.
Operation stage
     The surrounding base of hand pump or tube-well will be sealed off from the exterior
       by grouting with cement mortar to control percolation and contamination of ground
       water source.
     Periodic testing of drinking water supply source at the schools will be carried out for
       timely detection of contamination.

7.2.7 Impacts on Air Quality
Site and design
     Site selection and design of school do not have any significant impact on air quality.
       However, schools should not be established close to any existing source of air
       pollution
Construction Stage
     The movement of vehicles, land excavations, structure demolitions, and onsite
       stacking of materials can leads to dust emissions and prolonged suspension of fine
       particulates (PM10) in the ambient environment.
     Exhaust from vehicles and machinery during construction may deteriorate the local
       air quality.
Operation Stage
     Dust emissions from vehicles movement in the surrounding of school can also create
       minor adverse impact on air quality in surroundings of the school.

7.2.8 Mitigation for air quality impacts
Construction Stage:
     Stockpiled materials will be covered to control dust emissions
     Speed of vehicles will be reduced to avoid blowing of dust
     Demolition and excavation will be carried in batches to minimize dust emissions
     Proper lubrication of vehicles and machinery will be ensured to reduce emissions
      Water sprinkling will be carried out to reduce dust emissions where necessary and
       feasible.
Operation stage
    The exposed soil in surrounding of school will be re-vegetated and landscaped with
       community participation to control dust blowing.
    Community will be mobilised to observe low speed limits in the school vicinity.

7.3 Impacts on biological environment

7.3.1 Impact on natural vegetation
Site and design
     Improper site selection could lead to removal of natural vegetation and cutting of
       trees for construction of school building.


                                                                                          65
Construction stage
    excavation of foundation during construction may lead to removal of natural
       vegetative cover and trees cutting
Operation stage
    The operation of schools does not pose any direct threats to the trees and
       vegetation.

7.3.2   Impact on wildlife
       The project activities will not be carried out in the designated wildlife sanctuaries,
        game reserves areas, and hence no significant threats to wildlife are expected to
        occur during site selection, construction and operation stages of the project.

7.3.3 Mitigation for biological impacts
Siting and design
     Sites located in ecologically sensitive areas ( Annex-2) will not be selected for school
        to avoid impact on flora and fauna.
Construction stage
     Removal of mature trees will be avoided during construction. If unavoidable,
        compensatory tree plantation (five trees for each removed) will be carried out in
        consultation with Forest Department to reduce the impacts.

7.4 Socio-economic impacts
7.4.1  Noise and vibration
      During construction, the use of machinery and steel fabrication activities, particularly
       during school hours and at nighttimes, can produce unpleasant noise.
     Moving vehicles and use of pressure horns around the schools could be a source of
       noise and vibrations.
7.4.2 Mitigation for noise and vibrations impacts
Construction stage
     The contractor will ensure to avoid use of noise generating machinery, equipments
       during school hours and sleeping time at night so that community disturbance is
       minimal.
       Compliance with NEQS and World Bank noise guidelines will be ensured.
       The contractor will maintain and tune up all the vehicles and equipments during
        construction work.
       The community will be sensitised to observe silence zone in the school premises.
       Proper signboard will be installed indicating ban on use of pressure horns by moving
        vehicles around the school.

7.4.3 Health and safety impacts
The environmental impacts pertaining to health and safety at worksite relating to the design,
construction and operation stage of school are:
Designing
     Improper building design with poor ventilation and sunlight can lead to behavioural
       change and health impacts and create difficulties in learning.



                                                                                            66
      Improper building designs in flood plain or seismic prone areas can lead to increased
       vulnerability to disasters.
    Improper building designs without sanitation facilities can lead to health and hygiene
       problems for children.
Construction stage
    Open dumping and stockpiling of construction materials, scattered demolition wastes,
       and placement of debris / materials on nearby open spaces and streets can result in
       blocking of route and inconvenience for passersby, and residents.
    Haphazardly placed materials and debris presents higher risks of personal injury and
       inconvenience to schoolchildren and the staff (Fig. 26).
    Construction activities pose safety risks to children, teachers, construction workers,
       and nearby communities.
Operation stage
    Poor hygiene conditions and non-observance of health and hygiene guidelines during
       schools operation can increase vulnerability to health and personal safety impacts
       (Fig. 13, 24, and 35).
    Choking of sewer line and contamination of drinking water source can lead to
       occupational health impacts on school children
    Non-availability of safe drinking water in school can lead to health hygiene problems
       in schoolchildren.

7.4.4 Mitigation for health and safety impacts
Design stage
     Proper designing of school building will be followed according to guidelines in Section
       8.4.4 to provide ventilation and natural lighting in the class rooms.
     Appropriate building codes as per guidelines in Section 8.4.3 will be followed to
       designs buildings in the seismic prone areas and flood plains to avoid risks of
       damage to health and property.
Construction stage
     The contractor will ensure safe and covered stockpiling of the construction materials
       in separate place or corner in the premises of school. Demolition debris if not utilized
       will be disposed off in nearby safe places.
     The contractor will provide personal protective equipments such as gloves and boots
       to the laborers to avoid worksite hazards and accidents. Protective fencing will be
       used around the construction sites, excavated areas, and voids
Operation stage
     Awareness about personal hygiene will be raised among the students and
       surrounding community through health and hygiene sessions by the IPs
     The PTSMCs will ensure cleanliness of schools and regular checking of drinking
       water availability and quality, and working of the sewer line and septic tanks to
       ensure timely repair.

This chapter describes the environmental and social management plan and guidelines for the
construction of schools under the PGEB project. The Education Department, Balochistan will
implement the ESMP to ensure that the adverse environmental and social impacts of the
program are minimized. The institutional setup for implementing the ESMP has also been given
and the roles and responsibilities of concerned persons, monitoring mechanisms and capacity
building trainings needs have been described.

8.1     Institutional Setup for ESMP Implementation
The ESMP will be implemented under the overall supervision of Project Director, Project
Management Unit (PMU), Education Department, Balochistan. The Project Director PGEB
project is responsible for the implementation, monitoring and reporting of ESMP through the
Safeguard Officer to be appointed by the project. The Construction, Supervision and Facilitation
Partner (CSFP) will be carrying out construction work through contractors. CSFP will also be
responsible for supervision of the contractors work on the sites.

The Safeguard Officer will act as focal person at the provincial level to coordinate with all
stakeholders and at district level, the ESMP implementation responsibility will rest with the
District Education Officer of the concerned district. PTSMCs will be motivated to take active part
in the monitoring of contractors work on the site to ensure community participation in ESMP
implementation. Exhibit-6 shows the proposed institutional mechanism for ESMP
implementation from top to bottom level contractor, with assigned role and responsibilities.

The Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Plan describes the environmental and social
impacts, proposed mitigations measures to be implemented, monitoring parameters and role &
responsibilities for implementation of the mitigation measures and monitoring during design,
construction and operation stage of the project. The proposed environmental mitigation and
monitoring plan for PGEB project is given in Table-18.

8.4     Guidelines for Environmental Enhancement Opportunities
Balochistan province has different climatic regions and seismic zones. This diversity not only
exposes the regions to variety of environmental threats but at the same time provide
opportunities for developer to exploit this unique feature of the province for improvement of
environmental conditions and minimize the risk factors. The following environmental and social
guidelines have been developed to utilize such opportunities to protect the environment and
conserve natural resources in the province. These guidelines will be translated into Urdu in the
form of a manual or guidebook on “Environmental code of practices for construction of schools?
by the Project Management Unit which will be followed during site selection, designing,
construction and operation stages of project implementation, keeping in view the site specific
strengths and opportunities to avoid or lessen the likely damage to environment. These manual
or guidebook shall be printed in Urdu or local language and distributed among all stakeholders
including education department officials, Implementing Partner, Contractors, PTSMC members,
Teachers and Project Management Unit staff. The guidebook shall include the following:
    1. Site selection guidelines
    2. Eco-friendly design guidelines
    3. Design for construction of Eco-san toilets
    4. Design for rain-water harvesting facility
    5. Earthquake proof and flood resistant design guidelines
    6. Installation of solar powered lights and fans
    7. Tree plantation and landscape development guidelines
    8. Health and hygiene promotion in schools

8.4.1 Rain-Water Harvesting Facilities
Balochistan is water scarce region and availability of water for drinking, washing and irrigation is
not only an environmental issue of concern but also a major cause of social disputes among the
communities and tribes. The construction and operation of school in most of the rural area may
put an additional burden on the already scarce water resources. Rain water harvesting will be
introduced in the new school building at designing stage were feasible and used as an alternate
source of water for hand washing, toilets use and irrigating the orchards and vegetable gardens
in and around the school building to reduce pressure on the existing resources. The cost
implication, local climatic condition and acceptance by the local community will be considered in
designing such facilities in a particular school. Special design of toilets will also be employed to
minimize water consumption.


                                                                                                 71
8.4.2 Using Alternate Energy Sources
Pakistan is facing severe energy crisis. Prolong load shedding and non availability of electricity
is a common issue of concern today all over the country, Balochistan is not an exception rather
the energy crisis is worst in most of the province comparing to the rest of Pakistan. Introducing
alternative energy sources such as solar powered lighting, fans and other appliances will be
considered as an option in the new schools. The option will be decided keeping in view the site
characteristics and local climatic conditions, beside its economics and social acceptability. The
introduction of solar powered schools will minimize the additional load expected on local energy
supplies.

8.4.3 Earthquake and Flood Resistant Designing of Buildings
According to the relative severity of hazards index76 for earthquake, Kila Saifullah, Loralai, Kalat
and Khuzdar districts falls in the medium to high risk zone for earthquake while Pishin and
Quetta district are in the high risk zone. In these districts earthquake resistant buildings will be
constructed for new schools with proper designing and building codes followed as per the
seismic zoning classification of the area. Keck, Lasbela and Kachhi (Bolan) districts are located
in the flood plain area of the province. The structural designs of buildings in these districts will
address the flood risks. Appropriate site specific flood protection measures will be adopted in
the construction of proposed schools in these districts.

8.4.4 Eco-Friendly Design Guidelines for Construction of School.
Eco-friendly design of school is such that the students are provided with an atmosphere that is
environmentally safe, healthy and conducive to learning. Under the PGEB project 110 primary
and 20 middle level shelter less schools will be constructed. The main environmental
parameters to be considered during construction of new building are protection, providing
insulation and promoting natural ventilation for thermal comfort, health and hygiene, safe water
supply and sanitation and promoting environmental aesthetics to ensure healthy environment to
the children’s. Introducing eco-friendly designing does not require any extra costs but may
rather reduce the cost of construction if proper designing is carried out. Following environmental
guidelines will be followed in the designing to construct 130 shelter less schools in the project
area (12 districts).

 Environmental                     Eco-friendly design guidelines
 aspect in design
 Structure design of               The building is to be structurally stable, seismic proof, weatherproof
 schools                           according to the local environmental conditions, climatically
                                   comfortable, easily exited in case of emergency and well integrated
                                   with the environmental and cultural context of the area. The
                                   Balochistan Education Foundation has developed comprehensive
                                   structural guidelines and manual for construction of community
                                   schools in Balochistan, which must be followed for the PGEB project.

                           cleanliness and safety aspects will be considered during designing of
                           toilets building. Proper sewage disposal arrangements such as septic
                           tank with soaking pit will be provided.
Lighting, ventilation,     Classrooms need good fresh-air circulation to avoid heat and
humidity,                  excessive humidity. To ensure adequate daylight and ventilation,
                           sufficient windows must be provided in the building The design of
                           building will be done according to the local climate and weather
                           conditions. Classrooms will be sufficiently shaded from direct sunlight
                           and heat to maintain normal room temperature in summer plain
                           areas. The BESP construction manual for community schools will be
                           used to design school buildings.
Electricity and fittings   Electricity or solar power is needed to provide light and to operate
                           equipment. All rooms in the school shall be provided with a ceiling
                           fan, lights and exhaust fans. In large classrooms, two fans are
                           recommended.
Protection                 Depending on location and context, protection will be provided either
                           through boundary walls or fencing to keep children within the school
                           premises and also protect the school gardening and orchards from
                           animals grazing. In case of girls schools boundary wall of sufficient
                           height is recommended to ensure Parda for female students and
                           teachers.
Acoustics                  The location of design of school building should be such that the
                           surrounding noise caused by traffic, or any other source of sound
                           have minimum affect on the classroom students to avoid disturbance
                           in concentration and learning.
Access Ramps               Depending upon need basis, it is necessary to design access ramps
                           at the entrance, yards and near toilets for physically handicapped
                           children on wheelchairs, to allow him/her access to all school

                                   for solid waste disposal which shall be regularly cleaned to ensure
                                   clean and healthy environment to the students.
 Environmental                     Various factors such as plants, vegetation and landscaping have a
 Comfort                           softening and calming effect on the learning and provide
                                   environmental comfort. While designing school buildings sufficient
                                   space shall be provided for plantation and landscape development.

8.4.5 Tree Plantation and Landscaping
Plantation in open spaces will be a permanent feature of all proposed schools. The designs of
new buildings will have provision for tree plantation in, around the compound walls, and inside
the premises, where applicable. Community will also be sensitised through PTSMCs to carry out
landscaping and re-vegetation to match the natural topography and enhance environmental
aesthetics of the schools area. Fast growing iindigenous species of trees, shrubs and flowers
will be planted in the school compound through community participation to enhance the
environmental aesthetics

8.4.6 Health and Safety Guidelines
Preventive measures will be the main strategy for ensuring health and safety of schools
children’s during operation as well as workers at worksites during construction of buildings. A
detailed health and safety management plan (Table-19) has been prepared to ensure health
and safety of workers at worksites and children’s during schooling hours. First aid box and fire
extinguisher will be provided to each school to cope with accidental injuries and fires in
emergency. Trainings on the use of first aid box and fire extinguisher will be part of the health
and hygiene training to community, students and teachers in the schools. The contractor will be
responsible to provide personal protective equipments to the workers during construction work
at worksites.

8.4.7 Ban on Child Labour
Child labour or bonded labour will not be allowed in the construction of proposed schools. The
guidelines set forth by ILO Written Convention (C.138) on child labour and Employment of
Children Act, 199177 will follow while employing workers. The stipulated age for hiring labour will
not be below the age of fourteen (14) years.

8.4.8 Livelihood Improvement Opportunities
The construction of schools in the poorest of the poor and rural areas will also provide an
opportunity of work and income generation for un-employed workforce in the area. In the
proposed schools construction, preference shall be given to the local people for employment on
skilled and unskilled jobs during construction and operation to improve their livelihood. Equal
opportunities of work will be provided to locals according to their suitability for jobs in all project
activities.

8.5     Monitoring and Reporting
A comprehensive monitoring plan, comprising monitoring parameters, frequency and
responsibility of monitoring is outlined in Table-18. Compliance to the proposed monitoring plan
will be affected through the following monitoring mechanism:

8.5.1 Internal Monitoring
District Education Officer (DEO) will monitor the implementation of mitigation plan at the district
level with community participation. PTSMCs will regularly check the observance of proposed
mitigation measures and guidelines by the construction contractor at worksites. PTSMCs will
also be responsible for ESMP compliance during school operation phase. DEOs will make
routine as well as surprise visits of the schools in their operational areas, both during
construction and operation phases to ensure ESMP compliance. He/she will closely liaise with
PTSMCs to get regular feedback from each school regarding ESMP. He/she will send monthly
reports to the Safeguard Officer at PMU for evaluation and compliance.

Repair, rehabilitation and minor construction activities, if any, involved in providing missing
facilities to the existing schools shall also follow the mitigation plan proposed in Table-18 and
health and safety management plan proposed in Table-19. Guidelines given in Section 8.4 and
6.5 will be followed for electricity provision, toilets, water supply and construction of additional
classrooms. Compliance monitoring of these activities will be carried out by the DEO and
PTSMCs at the community level to ensure the implementation of mitigation measures and
guidelines for environmental enhancement opportunities.

Capacity building training for DEOs and PTSMCs will ensure effective monitoring and reporting
of ESMP compliance. Necessary resources such as vehicle and fuel will be provided to the
DEOs for monitoring. The Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, PMU will also randomly conduct
monitoring of the school sites in the project areas, both during construction and school operation
phases and submit their monitoring reports to the Safeguard Officer in the PMU for necessary
corrective action.

The DEO will compile monitoring reports of the district and send to the Safeguard Officer for
evaluation and mid course correction, if required. The Safeguard Officer will process, analyse
and forward the consolidated report of all districts to the Project Director, PCC and World Bank
for usage and decision-making. The PMU may hire the services of environmental and social
expert (consultant), if so required on any issue related to environmental and social impact
mitigation or non-conformity surfaced up from monitoring activities.

8.5.2 External Monitoring/Third Party Validation
The primary purpose of the external monitoring will be to see that both construction and the
operational phase activities have been undertaken in line with the ESMP recommendations.
Third Party Validation (TPV) through an independent monitoring agency will be carried out on
annual basis to evaluate the overall ESMP implementation progress, and to ensure that the
mitigation measures are implemented as per mitigation plan. In case of any deviation, corrective
actions will be taken where necessary. For TPV, environmental and social specialists having


                                                                                                 75
relevant expertise and previous experience will be engaged. A detailed Terms of Reference for
hiring the services of TPV is given at Annex-F.

8.6     Capacity Building and Training Plan
Capacity building and training of the staff associated with ESMP implementation play an
important role towards achieving its objectives. The staff designated for ESMP implementation
at the PMU and district level may not have the desired technical expertise to carry out
monitoring of the proposed environmental and social mitigation measures without capacity
building and trainings. Specific training on environmental and social mitigation plan will be
arranged for the Safeguard Officer, District Education Officers, PTSMC members and Project
Management Unit team to deliver their monitoring responsibilities in an organized and effective
manner as per requirement of the monitoring plan.

Table-20 gives a tentative schedule of capacity building and trainings program for PGEB
project. The prime objective of the trainings is to enhance the technical capacity of staff
associated with ESMP implementation and to keep the Project Management Team,
Implementing Staff of Education Department, and PTSMCs aware of the emerging
environmental and social issues, and enabled them to resolve those issues through proposed
mitigation measures.

Fourteen (14) training workshops, two at provincial level and 12 at district level, are proposed in
the first year of the project. In second and third year, four refreshers, trainings at provincial level
would be arranged on annual basis. The Provincial and District level officers involved in the
ESMP implementation will primarily attend these workshops. These workshops will focus on
environmental as well as social issues, confronted during ESMP implementation. Besides,
these will also focus on sensitizing the participants about environmental and social stakes of the
project, managing the on-ground problems, and assuring implementation of the ESMP
guidelines.

In order to fetch the best quality resource persons for these trainings it is proposed to outsource
these trainings to an environmental consultancy firm or an NGO of national repute and standing.
Table-21, indicate the approximate cost of the proposed capacity building trainings for the
project duration. The first phase of PGEB project is three years and the training cost has
estimated for the first phase of the project.

8.7     ESMP Disclosure
The Environmental and Social Mitigation Plan (ESMP) will be publicized and disclosed on the
website of Education Department, Government of Baluchistan. It will also be disclosed on the
project specific Infoshop of the World Bank. Hard copies of ESMP will also be shared with the
Provincial EPA, Implementing Partner NGOs and Construction Contractors, Civil Society
Organizations. A copy of the ESMP will be placed in the Project Management Unit, PGEB
project for public access. Executive summary of ESMP will be translated into Urdu and other
local languages such as Pashtu, Baluchi and distributed to all relevant stakeholders more
particularly to the communities in the project areas. The purpose will be to inform them about


                                                                                                    76
the project activities, negative environmental and social impacts expected from the project and
proposed mitigation measures

8.8     ESMP Costs
The estimated cost of ESMP implementation include the capacity building training of staff
including payments to the resource persons, training module and materials, internal monitoring
costs and external monitoring/Third Party Validation (TPV). The cost of mitigation measures will
be included in the tender documents of the project to be floated in the press and executed by
the Education Department through contractors. The total estimated cost for ESMP
implementation and monitoring is PKR 7.02 million for a three year project period. Table-22,
indicate the details of cost estimates for implementation of the ESMP during the three year
project period.

 1.    Introduction
The Education Department, Government of Baluchistan has received funds from the World
Bank under a project titled “Promotion of Girls Education in Baluchistan?. Under this project
120 primary and 10 middle level shelter less schools will be constructed and 150 new
(mixed gender) community schools will be established in selected 12 districts including
Kachhi, Loralai, Jhal Magsi, Khuzdar, Kalat, Lasbela, Jaferabad, Kech, Panjgur, Kila
Saifullah, Pishin and Naseerabad.

An environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) study has been prepared to
evaluate the potentially adverse environmental and social impacts of the project activities
specifically the constructed related activities and operation of schools. The report outlines a
detailed environmental and social management plan (ESMP) including monitoring plan for
reducing or mitigating the significant adverse impacts. The Environmental Mitigation and
Monitoring Plan describes the environmental and social impacts, proposed mitigations
measures to be implemented, monitoring parameters and role & responsibilities for
implementation of the mitigation measures, monitoring during design, construction and
operation stage of the project.

In view of the need to assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the ESMP third party
validation by a suitably qualified firms or individual consultant having desired qualification
and experience of monitoring is proposed.             The TPV for monitoring the ESMP
implementation will also ensure that an in-depth and objective assessment would be done
based on sound monitoring parameters and using standard tools. The findings of TPV shall
