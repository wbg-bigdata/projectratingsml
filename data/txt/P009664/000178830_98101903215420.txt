SUW4ARY AND CONCLUSIONS
I.        This report appraises a proposed major expansion of the produc-
tion facilities of The Fertilisers and Chemicals, Travancore Ltd., (FACT),
a public sector company in the State of Kerala, India. The Government
of India (GOI) owns 81% of the company. Fertilizer production is a major
part of India's efforts to improve agricultural output. This project,
which will have a design capacity of 485,000 tons per year of granulated
nitrogenous, phosphatic and potash (14PK) fertilizers, would make a signi-
ficant contribution towards rmeeting India's increasing fertilizer require-
ments. A small by-product plant for 7,500 tons per year of cryolite which
is used in aluminum manufacture is also included.
ii.        Total financing required for the project is estimated at $50.7
million (Rs 380 million), of which $19.6  million is in foreign exchange.
GOT will provide the financing with at least half in equity and with the
balance in loan. The proposed IDA credit of $20 million (Rs 150 million)
will be relent by the Government as part of its loan. The loan to FACT
will be at 3.5% interest per annum with a maturity schedule that includes
three years of grace and ten equal annual repayments for each wiclhdrawal
from GOI by FACT. Based on expected withdrawals the maximum life of the
loan will be 16 years.
iii.       FACT's existing plants are small, in part obsolete and have
encountered operating difficulties which have adversely affected the
company's financial position. Followin,g recommendations of a 1969 IDA
mission the company prepared a rationalization program which is now being
implemented. The December 1970 appraisal mission reviewed this program
and the Association is satisfied that FACT, with the help of some
experienced consultants, is capable of improving existing operations,
completing and operating a new urea plant (Cochin I) now under construc-
tion and of executing the proposed NPK project. To carry out such ambi-
tious investments and to adjust its debt service to realistic expectations
of cash generation, the company's financial position will be improved by
increasing equity and rescheduling existing debt.
iv.        The managing contractor for the project will be FACT E.ngineering
and D)esign f)rganisation (FEDO), a division of FACT, withi major portions
subcontracted to other engineering firms and local contractors. The
project is based on conventional technology within the experience and
capability of FEDO which has designed and constructed similar plants al-
though not of the same magnitude. To assist with the project, the company
has selected several international engineering firms as process subcon-
tractors who will supply the necessary technical support.
v.        CGovernment-owned fertilizer plants in India have experienced
substantial delays in construction and start-up difficulties and on the
whlole have not yet been able to reach normal levels of capacity utiliza-



- if -
tion.  Various factors have been responsible for tlhis, niot all within the
control of the plants concerned.  1lowever, GOI has become increasingly
aware of the high cost of construction delays and undertutilized plant.
It has agreed that for the planned project the construction scheduile
should not be more than 33 months.  It is therefore expecte(d that tlle
project will be completed by March 1974.
vi.       Procedures for the procurement of foreign and domestic equip-
ment have been agreed with FACT and GOI. The Government has indicated
that it will reserve about 12% of the value of equipment and materials
for Indian suppliers. These items are expected to be procured within the
requirements of time and quality imposed by the project.  All other equip-
ment will be bid competitively by international tender with assurances
given by GOI that all import licenses required will be promptly issued.
Any reserved Indian equipment which is delayed and might endanger timely
completion of the project will be promptly secured from other sources.
The proceeds of the proposed IDA credit would be used for internation-
ally bid equipment, imported materials for equipment on the "reserved
list", costs of foreign process licenses, plant designs and consultant
services as well as a portion of the local costs of FEDO's engineering
and equipment erection costs.
vii.      Projections of Indian fertilizer demand and supply indicate
that, even on optimistic estimates of local production, India will have an
annual production shortfall through this decade of around 900,000 tons
of nitrogen and 800,000 tons of phosphates. The foreign exchange required
to import the tonnages required is substantial and emphasizes the hiigh
priority of the proposed project, which will save India approximately
$16 million per year in foreign exchange.
viii.     In FACT's marketing region in South India, projections of
fertilizer demand and supply show nitrogen in balance in the latter half
of the decade and a continuing shortfall in phosphatic fertilizer supply
of around 150,000 tons per year (in terms of nutrients). Since the
project's output will be NPK fertilizers with a high nutrient content and
ease of application, no sales difficulties are expected. FACT's market-
ing organization will be strengthened by adding more distribution points
and, on the basis of the company's successful marketing experience in the
past, it should be able to handle the increased volume satisfactorily.
Moreover, FACT will carry out a large seeding program for NPK to assure
the successful introduction of its new products. The effectiveness of
the company's marketing efforts will depend heavily on the availability
of agricultural credit. The Government has assured IDA that FACT will
have a suitable level of working capital to cover normal company opera-
tions and to finance required credit to the extent not available from the
banking system.



- iii -
ix.       The project provides a suitable economic return of 13.5%, which
indicates that production costs of the project are competitive interna-
tionally. Profitability of the project is satisfactory, with an indicated
financial return of 19.5%. The project is highly sensitive to relative
changes in selling and raw material prices and to any delay in completion
of the project.
x.        There have been no previous IDA credits or Bank loans to the
Government-owned fertilizer industry of India. IFC has participated
in two private sector fertilizer projects, (Indian Explosives, Ltd., in
Uttar Pradesh and Zuari Agro Chemicals, Ltd., in Goa) and is considering
a third. Indian Explosives is successfully in operation and Zuari Agro
is anticipated to start production in mid-1972. IDA is also considering
several other fertilizer projects with the GOI-owned Fertilizer Corpora-
tion of India (FCI), the largest fertilizer company in India with five
existing plants and three presently under construction. In addition,
the Bank is Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed phosphate mining project
study in Rajasthan.
xi.       Based on the assurances received during negotiations, the project
is suitable for an IDA credit of $20 million.






I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of India (GOI) has requested financing from the
International Development Association (IDA) for a major expansion of
fertilizer production facilities of The Fertilisers and Chemicals, Tra-
vancore Limited (FACT), which are located near Cochin port in Southiwest
India. This expansion, designated as the Cochin II Project, would add
about 115,000 metric tons per year (TPY) phosphates (as P205); 54,000 TPY
potash (as K20); and 47,000 TPY nitrogen (as N) capacity to FACT's present
capability. The increased production will be high nutrient content, gra-
nulated NPK 1/ fertilizers to meet the increasing demand in South India
and will permit FACT to market more balanced and competitive grades of
fertilizers than their present products. The plant will produce six dif-
ferent grades with an average NPK analysis of 19-23-11.
1.02      FACT has been producing fertilizers in Kerala State since 1948
and markets its own production, as well as fertilizer from the Government
Fertilizer Pool, in the states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Mysore, Andhra Pra-
desh and the Union Territories of Goa and Pondicherry. FACT's existing
factories are in Udyogamandal near Cochin port (see Map). A major ammonia-
urea factory (Cochin I) located about 20 km from Udyogamandal is expected
to begin operations in mid-1971 and the proposed expansion would be adja-
cent to it. Both factories are served by major highway routes and are
located adjacent to commercial waterways. Cochin has railroad facilities
at its factory and Udyogamandal has railroad stations nearby.
1.03      The proposed new project was originally conceived by FACT as an
elemental phosphorus project. An IDA mission studied this proposal in mid-
1969 and recommended that FACT should consider a more economic route for
obtaining phosphoric acid, either by import or manufacture from sulfur
and phosphate rock. IDA also recommended that FACT review its existing
facilities and devise a scheme for increasing performance. FACT has res-
ponded to both recommendations and submitted a project feasibility report
to IDA in October, 1970. An appraisal mission visited FACT in December
1970 to assess the proposed project and a program to rationalize existing
operations.
1.04      The Cochin II Project will produce sulfuric acid, phosphoric
acid, granular NPK fertilizers, as well as cryolite which is used in the
production of aluminum. The design is based on imported sulfur, ammonia,
phosphate rock and potash; plus urea from the Cochin I plant. The!
project includes necessary port facilities to handle the large quantities
of raw materials and all required offaites.
1/   The nomenclature used to describe multi-nutrient fertilizers is N-P-K,
referring respectively to the % Nitrogen (N), % P205 (P), and % K20
(K). Thus 28-28-0 contains 28% nitrogen, 28% P205 and no potash;
17-17-17 contains 17% of each nutrient. The term phosphate is used in
all cases to refer to the P205 content.



-2-
1.05      FACT is presently in financial difficulty due to poor operating
performance at Udyogamandal and a 1-1/2 year delay in completing the
Cochin I ammonia-urea project. Due to losses in recent years, FACT has not
been able to meet portions of its maturing debts to GOT and negotiations
are now being completed between GOT and FACT to restructure the company's
debt.
1.06      The appraisal report was prepared by Messrs. Donald E. Brown
and Anthony R. Perram of the Industrial Projects Department, based on
missions to India in December 1970 and February/March 1971.
II. FACT's EXISTING OPERATIONS
A.   History and Organization
2.01      FACT was incorporated iln 1943 as a private company with the
Government of the State of Travancore (now part of Kerala) having a sub-
stantial holding. The company's management was taken over in 1960 by
the Government of Kerala, by then the major shareholder. GOI, which
subsequently acquired the majority shares, has managed the company since
1963. GOI presently owns about 81% of FACT with the State Governments of
Kerala, Tamil Nadu, PHysore and Andhra Pradesh holding about 15% of the
shares and the remaining 4% is held by about 5,500 private shareholders.
2.02      FACT began operations as a small producer of single super phos-
phate and since then has completed several expansion projects. FACT
presently produces and markets ammonium phosphate, ammonium sulfate,
mixed NPK products, and in 1971, will add urea production. The company's
present capacity is about 7% of the total fertilizer capacity in India.
With the Cochin Division the proportion will increase to about 12%.
2.03      FACT has five operating divisions which report to the Managing
Director: (1) Udyogamandal (UDL), which operates the existing plants;
(2) Cochin, which will operate the ammonia/urea plant now under construc-
tion and the Cochin II plant when it is completed; (3) FACT Engineering
and Design Organisation (FEDO), the planning and engineering arm of FACT;
(4) FACT Engineering Works (FEW), a small equipment ranufacturer; and (5)
Marketing, which handles all ferti:Lizer sales. These divisions are fur-
ther described in Chapter VI and in Annex 1.
B.   FACT Management
2.04      FACT has a 12-member Board of Directors of which eight are chosen
by GOI, two by Kerala, and two by private shareholders. The Board meets
about seven times a year to review operations and decide on major invest-
ments, budget and policy issues. The Board has delegated considerable au-
thority to the Managing Director, who is a Board member chosen by GOI. He
acts as principal liaison with the shareholders and directs day to day
operations assisted by the Finance Manager, who functions as his deputy.



-3-
2.05      FACT's overall management capability was assessed by IDA in July
and August 1969, including a report by P. A. Management Consultants, Limit-
ed, of London. The major problems found then were: (1) management inform-
ation, such as production, marketing, and financial reports were not com-
plete nor prepared on time; (2) the UDL division had excessive staff, with
poorly defined lob specifications; and (3) maintenance was not properly
scheduled. Some improvement has occurred but the basic problems still
exist.
2.06      The Managing Director has recently been transferred and a new Man-
aging Director has been appointed who appears to be capable and is satisfac-
tory to the Association. The Cochin II Project Manager has had production
and engineering experience and appears to be capable. The appointment of
highly competent people to the senior management positions (three key per-
sonnel have been lost recently by death or transfer) and continuity of man-
agement are particularly important to the company and the execution of the
project since the company is not deep in management personnel.
2.07      The company recognizes that cost accounting and reporting need im-
provement. Reasons given for the unsatisfactory reporting were union pro-
blems within the accounting department, installation of a new computer sys-
tem, and concentration on improving production rates. However, the speed
with which information requested was produced, was impressive as was the
amount of detail provided. The company intends to introduce monthly pro-
duction cost data for each individual production unit, improve quarterly fi-.
nancial statements and budget goals for future operations, using realistic
production targets to stimulate improvements in operations. FACT has given
assurances to IDA that its cost accounting and management information sys-
tem will be satisfactory by January 1972.

FACT's earnings record has been unsatisfactory over the past years. In-
creasing sales and stable selling prices since 1968 have been offset by low
operating performance and higher operating costs, particularly labor. These
problems were quite evident in 1970. Net losses over the six-yea?r period
total Rs 29 million or about 5.5% of net sales from operations. The corn--
pany expects that fiscal 1971 will show a loss although the exact result
will depend upon decisions to *be made regarding deferred expenses for rmarket
development.

*Preliminary figures
2.10      Recent losses and delays in the completion of the Cochin I Project
have prevented FACT from paying its maturing debt to GOI. By March 31,
1971 this unpaid debt had accrued to Rs 81 million including Rs 21 million
interest which is now being renegotiated. Payments on outstanding loans
to the Industrial Finance Corporation of India and on the Italian credits
for Cochin I have been paid on schedule. GOI has been supplying funds to
FACT, particularly for the Cochin I project, in the form of two-thirds
debt and one-third equity. The combination of high debt and losses has
made the company financially weak and has required increased short-term
borrowings which have been difficult to obtain. The company now has a
negative working capital position and high debt service requirements which
will be eased by the rescheduling of the GOI loans and the provision of
additional funds by GOI if required   (para. 4.08).



III. PROPOSED COCHIN II PROJECT
A.   Project Scope
3.01      The proposed expansion (Cochin II) has a design capacity of
435,000 TPY of granulated, high analysis NPK fertilizers and 7,500 TPY
cryolite. The grades, production schedule and ex-factory sales prices
for the NPK products and cryolite are shown in Annex 4. NPK production
is based on imported phosphate rock, potash, sulfur and ammonia and
includes manufacture of sulfuric and phosphoric acid as intermediate
products. Urea will be obtained from Cochin I. The major plants will
be based on licensed designs from contractors that have been selected by
FACT. The project also includes the necessary facilities at Cochin port,
about 15 km away.
B.   Project Description and Ecology
3.02      The phosphoric acid plant will have a design capacity of 115,000
TPY P205. FACT has a licensing agreement with The Engineering and Indus-
trial Corporation of Luxembourg (Prayon) for phosphoric acid design know-
how. The process represents conventional and commercial technology, and
Prayon and FACT both have considerable experience in design and operation
of these plants.
3.03      The sulfuric acid (H2SO4) plant is a 330,000 TPY unit based
on elemental sulfur. The process and size represent commercial and con-
ventional technology and FACT's licensor, Chemiebau, Dr. A. Zieren GmbH
& Company KG (Chemiebau), of Germany has adequate experience, including
designs of up to 264,000 TPY sulfuric acid.
3.04      The NPK plant will have a design capacity of 485,000 TPY NPK
based on technology from Wellman-Power Gas Inc., of the U.S. Their
granulation experience includes about 20 commercial plants including
Coromandel in India.
3.05      The cryolite plant will produce 7,500 TPY and is based on a
similar plant that FACT now has under construction.
3.06      Port facilities and other offsites represent a major portion of
the project.  The Cochin Port Trust has agreed to provide a wharf and a
mooring berth exclusively for FACT.  GOI and FACT have agreed to provide
the necessary assurances from the Cochin Port Trust as a condition of
effectiveness of the IDA credit.  FEDO's design of the port, transporta-
tion and site facilities was reviewed with FEDO's engineering staff and
is considered adequate.
3.07      A phosphate fertilizer complex such as the Cochin II project
discharges several streams that are potential pollution hazards. The
effluents are fluorine and sulfur compounds that may be discharged to



- 6 -
the atmosphere, fluorine compounds that may be discharged in liquid
wastes, and a solid material (gypsum) that is stored. FEDO has designed
the project to control these effluents within normal practice in the
industry. The cryolite plant offers the advantage of recovering fluorine
from phosphoric acid manufacture and decreases a potential pollution
problem.
3.08      A more complete technical description of the project, including
pollution control is given in Annex 5.
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCIAL PLAN
A.   Capital Costs
4.01      The total estimated financing required for the project is Rs 380
million (US$50.7 million) which includes interest during construction.
These costs are summarized below and further details are given in Annex 6.

4.02      The foreign exchange portion of capital costs, including working
capital, is estimated at $19.6 million. The foreign exchange costs are
based on 12% of total equipment beLng reserved for Indian procurement and
the expectation that approximately 40% of the internationally bid equip-
mnent will be won by Indian suppliers.
4.03      The above costs represent: preliminary estimates based on the
project beginning in mid-1971 and iinclude adequate price escalation.



Costs have been conservatively stated and the contingency, representing
10% of the direct project costs, should be sufficient.
B.   Working Capital
4.04      Total working capital requirements for the project at an annual
production rate of 436,500 tons (90% of capacity) are estimated at Rs 209
million ($28 million) as shown in Annex 7. The above figure is based on
four months accounts receivable, three months raw material storage (except
urea and ammonia) and two months product storage. The initial working
capital is assumed at Rs 50 million ($6.7 million) of which the foreign
exchange component is $5.1 million.
C.   Financial Plan
4.05      The Rs 380 million financing needed for the project will be
provided by the Government, with at least half (Rs 190 million) in the
form of equity and the balance as loan. The proceeds of the proposed
IDA credit of Rs 150 million ($20 million) would be relent by the
Government as part of its loan under a subsidiary loan agreement.
4.06      The interest rate for the subsidiary loan agreed to in negotia-
tions is 8.5% per annum. GOI's normal policy is to approve the funds
for the entire project and then disburse them to the recipient in quarterly
installments, each of which constitutes a separate loan. Each disburse-
ment has a three-year grace and a ten-year repayment period. Since the
final disbursement is expected to be made in the fourth year after start
of construction the last maturity would be in the sixteenth year of the
project. The financial forecasts in the annexes correspond to this
maturity schedule. Since the loan from GOI to FACT is wholly a rupee
loan, the exchange risk remains with the Government.
4.07      The following table gives a summary of the total estimated
sources and application of funds for FACT as a whole during implementa-
tion of the project (Refer to Chapter IX).

*Including Rs 23 million for Cochin I.



- 8 -
4.08      The forecasted cash generation is based on UDL operating at
improved levels and Cochin I achieving its expected production. GOI and
FACT are currently renegotiating the company's debt.  It is expected that
the actual amount of rescheduling will be Rs 85 million with repayment be-
ginning in FY 1972 and ending five years thereafter. Completion of the
arrangements for the debt rescheduling will be a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed credit. Although IDA anticipates that further rescheduling
may be necessary for some arnounts; due towards the end of FY 1972, the Asso-
ciation has agreed to this scheme because (a) negotiations for the resched-
uling are virtually completed and (b) the Government has agreed to keep
the company in a liquid position during construction with a current ratio
of at least 1.5:1 being obtained at the start of commercial production.
4.09      To protect against an overrun in project costs (including Cochin
I) or shortfall in cash generation, GOI has agreed to provide funds neces-
sary to complete the project and put FACT in a sound financial position
including adequate working capital. To this end the Government will put a
minimum of 50% of the funds representing Cochin I and Cochin II investments
in the form of equity by completion of Cochin II. GOI also agreed to set
a goal of a long-term debt/equity ratio of not greater than 55/45 for the
company after Cochin II begins commercial operation. The Association's
projections show that at the time Cochin II starts up, FACT should be in
a sound financial position (a long-term debt/equity ratio of about 50/50
and a current ratio of about 1.5:1).
V. PROJECT EXECUTION
A.   Project Management
5.01      FEDO will act as managing contractor for the Cochin II project.
IDA's evaluation of FEDO as an engineering company, is given in Annex 1.
In view of the overall size and complexity of Cochin II, FACT has agreed
to employ an experienced Assistant Project Manager plus one experienced
Engineer to assist FEDO in budget and schedule control and in general en-
gineering, procurement, and construction duties. The Assistant Project
Manager will remain until completion of the project and the Engineer is
expected to stay 2-3 years.
5.02      Tn addition, FACT will use selected process licensors in design,
equipment selection, construction and start-up. The extent of such assist-
ance by the licensors (beyond their initial process package) is expected to
be as follows:



-9-
Man Months
Sulfuric Acid (Chemiebau)         8-12
Phosphoric Acid (Prayon)         12-18
NPK (Wellman-Power Gas)          60-80
The assistance is primarily aimed at adding depth and experience to the
FEDO organization to ensure the success of Cochin II. FEDO has already
established continuing associations with Chemiebau and Prayon for sulfuric
and phosphoric acid designs, respectively, and has recently concluded a
contract with Wellman-Power Gas for the NPK plant. FACT is now completing
final agreements with Chemiebau and Prayon and arranging for the engineer-
ing personnel described above. IDA has reviewed these agreements in draft
form and found them acceptable. Their satisfactory conclusion is a con-
dition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
5.03      To avoid FEDO's overextending its management and engineering
staff capacity during project execution, FEDO will not accept any engineer-
ing contracts in excess of Rs 1,500,000 ($200,000) each without first
consulting with IDA until engineering for Cochin II is substantially
completed. FACT has agreed not to undertake any other major capital invest-
ment program in excess of Rs 7,500,000 ($1,000,000) per year without IDA's
consent.
B.   Project Schedule and Procurement
5.04      FEDO has updated its critical path schedule for the project on
the basis of a completion time of 33 months. For appraisal purposes, proj-
ect construction has been assumed as 36 months, but a concerted effort will
be made to realize the 33-month schedule. The shorter schedule is largely
dependent on efficient implementation of procurement. GOI has expressed
a strong desire to minimize project execution time and has agreed to the
33-month schedule as the governing criterion to which all its and the com-
pany's actions will be geared and has modified its procurement policy with
this objective in mind.
5.05      The Government agreed that the equipment and materials reserved
for procurement from Indian suppliers will be limited to about 12% of the
total estimated equipment value. IDA is satisfied that the "reserved list"
includes only those items that do not have critical delivery time and can be
supplied from Indian firms in adequate quality. If it should become evident
that delivery of any equipment on the reserved list would adversely affect
the project's critical path schedule, then the Government will permit such
items to be shifted promptly to international or other procurement sources.



- 10 -
5.06      All other equipment will be bid by international competitive
tender, including India. Indian suppliers will be given a 15% cost pref-
erence in bid evaluations compared against the CIF India price of competi-
tive equipment bids. GOI has given assurance that after FEDO has completed
its bid analysis and decided the procurement source, any required import
licenses will be issued promptly.
5.07      In collaboration with the process licensors, FEDO will prepare
suitable bid packages which will permit qualified Indian suppliers to com-
pete on the smaller of the packages but still maintain project schedule
and equipment standardization requirements.
5.08      The proposed IDA credit will include an estimated $0.5 million
of foreign exchange costs for the import of materials and components to
be used by Indian suppliers for items on the "reserved list". While to
the extent practical these imports will be subjected to international
shopping, their speed of procurement will be the governing factors. FEDO
will coordinate the import of such materials and components.
C.   Allocation of IDA Credit
5.09      The proceeds of the proposed IDA credit would be used as follows
(see Annex 6):
Use of IDA Credit
$ Million
1.   Equipment                                     15.2
2.   Equipment (for foreign components
of "reserved list")                          0.5
3.   Engineering and Equipment Erection
(a)  Licensors                                 1.3
(b)  FEDO                                      0.5
4.   Technical Assistance                           0.5
5.   Unallocated                                    2.0
Total                                    20.0
The allocation of IDA funds to the above categories is approximate at this
time and may have to be revised somewhat when FEDO has completed its detailed
engineering work. The credit will cover the CIF cost of imported equipment
and the ex-factory price (excluding taxes) of locally procured equipment
that is internationally bid. As mentioned before, the credit will also
include the CIF cost of imported foreign components of locally procured
equipment on the "reserved list", and the foreign exchange costs of process
licenses and consultants' services. A portion of FEDO's local costs for
engineering and equipment erection is also included. The estimated foreign



- 11 -
exchange content of the proposed credit is about $15 million, which assumes
that 30% of the internationally bid equipment is won by Indian suppliers
(para. 4.02). The projected disbursement schedule for the IDA credit is
contained in Annex 6.
VI. MARKET AND MARKETING
A.   Present Situation in India
6.01      A major goal of Indian economic development is self-sufficiency
in agriculture, including fertilizer production. However, India currently
imports about half of the required fertilizer nutrients as finished prod-
ucts and as intermediate raw materials. Nitrogen, the major fertilizer
nutrient, is produced in India primarily as ammonia and urea with most
manufacture based on naphtha from imported petroleum feedstocks. Current
plans propose increasing reliance on fuel oil and indigenous coal as raw
materials to produce nitrogen fertilizer. India permits some ammonia
imports, but imposes a 60 percent duty on the CIF price. Use of imported
ammonia may increase as a result of recent trade agreements between India
and Iran.
6.02      Virtually no phosphate material is produced in India.  While
feasibility studies are about to start (financed by UNDP with the Bank
as Executing Agency) to develop promising phosphate rock deposits in
Rajasthan these deposits are not likely in the near future to produce
enough rock to make India self-sufficient. India imports large amounts
of phosphate rock and, in recent years, the Government has granted per-
mission for three companies 1/ to also import phosphoric acid. Potash,
or potassium chloride, is not produced locally; so all requirements are
imported, either as potash or in a finished NPK product.
6.03      Fertilizer consumption and production for the period 1964-1970
are shown below based on data from the Fertilizer Association of India,
the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and IDA.
1/   Madras, Zuari Agro, and Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative
(IFFCO).

6.04      Consumption of nitrogen increased during the six-year period at
an average annual rate of about 20%. Local production rose even more
quickly (about 28% per year) but was not able to catch up with demand.
Phosphate consumption increased at about 28% annually and here too pro-
duction was unable to meet demand. Low production levels (about 60% of
capacity) in existing plants have contributed to these deficits.  Further-
more, while a more normal ratio between nitrogen and phosphate should be
approximately 2:1, the actual ratio in India in 1969/70 was about 3.3:1.
Consumption of phosphate fertilizer therefore has lagged substantially
behind that of nitrogenous fertilizer. Foreign exchange expenditures for
imports of nitrogen and phosphate have averaged in excess of $150 million
annually during recent years.
6.05      Annexes 8 and 9 give lists of the fertilizer plants now in op-
eration, under construction, or planned in India; recent production; and
major sources of finance.
B.   Market Forecast for India
6.06      Estimates for supply and demand of nitrogen and phosphate fertil-
izer nutrients for all of India for the current Fourth Five-Year Plan (end-
ing March 31, 1974) and the Fifth Five-Year Plan (ending March 31, 1979)
are shown below. These projections are based on a previous Bank study
(September 30, 1970) and a projection recently prepared by the GOI (Ministry
of Petroleum and Chemicals). The demand projections through 1973/74 are
taken from the Bank study mentionecd above and are based on a projection
model that included historical data plus growth rates in area irrigated
and in fertilizer consuming crops. The figures for the Fifth Five-Year
Plan (1974/79) are based on IDA's extrapolation of these data and its
estimate of completion dates for individual plants (Annexes 8 and 9).

6.07      The table indicates a substantial nitrogen deficit through the
period. The deficit decreases slightly in the early years as new Fertilizer
Corporation of India (FCI) and FACT urea units come on stream but widens
again thereafter. The phosphate deficit grows from about 500,000 tons per
year to 800-900,000. The supply forecasts are based on a realizable but
optimistic schedule for new projects and on all plants achieving a 90%
capacity utilization. The assumptions used in the forecasts are explained
in Annex 8. Therefore, the supply figures represent IDA's best estimate
of the maximum fertilizer production India can reasonably be expected to
achieve. If the assumptions on capacity utilization and schedule of proj-
ects are not fulfilled, then the estimated supply could be 10-20% below
the above forecasts.
C.   Fertilizer Market in South India
6.08      Estimated consumption of nitrogen and phosphate from 1969/70
(actual) to 1978/79 for the four southern states (FACT's marketing area)
is given in Annex 10. Average annual growth rates anticipated by FACT
through 1973/74 are about 10% for nitrogen and 20% for phosphate and
thereafter are assumed for both nutrients at about 13%. It has been
assumed that phosphate consumption would increase at a faster rate than
nitrogen until the ratio reaches 2:1. FACT assumed fertilizer growth
rates below those for the rest of India because of the already higher
fertilizer application in South India. The FACT estimates are the most
conservative and are used in this evaluation. They are based on exten-
sive market surveys and the requirements of N, P and K for the area's
main crops (rice, wheat, tea, fruits, nuts, spices, sugar, cotton, vege-
tables, and tobacco).
6.09      The projected supply and demand of fertilizer for South India
are shown below. The supply data are taken from Annex 11.

6.10      The locations of the fertilizer producers in South India are
shown in the map along with major broad gauge rail lines to illustrate the
market area served by FACT. The principal competitors to FACT will be Zuari
Agro (Goa), Madras (Tamil Nadu), and Coromandel (Andhra Pradesh). IDA's
assessment of supply assumes that the above three producers will operate
at 90% capacity from 1974/75 onward. Superphosphate production is projected
at 40,000 TPY P205 based on FACT's estimate.  Other proposed projects in
South India are Coromandel Expansion (II and III), Mangalore, Tuticorin
(Southern Petrochemical Industries Corporation), Ramagundam, and Occidental
at Vizag. These are assumed to come into production over the period 1975-
1979; however, the probability of all five of these projects maintaining
the schedule given is considered unlikely. These production forecasts are
more optimistic than the all-India forecast in Annexes 8 and 9 to show the
maximum competition that FACT would have to contend within its marketing
area.
6.11      In spite of the optimistic supply forecast, a phosphate produc-
tion deficit will still exist in South India and FACT should have no sales
difficulty as far as total market demand is concerned. The phosphate def-
icit ranges from 130-170,000 TPY over 1974-1979 and would be met by a net
inflow from North Indian plants (such as FCI Trombay) or imports. The sup-
ply deficit will remain high unless a number of the other projects proceed
at a considerably faster rate than now appears likely.
6.12      The nitrogen supply could be essentially in balance in South
India by 1976/77 based on FACT's conservative estimate of consumption and
the optimistic forecast of supply. Nevertheless, even if such balance could
be achieved the nitrogen from Cochin II will be sold as NPK fertilizer and,
with the large deficit of P205 expected, the company's NPK fertilizers should
be marketed with no difficulty even if competition develops in straight ni-
trogen. The company's competitive position is further discussed in paras.
6.21 to 6.23 below.

D.   FACT Marketing Area and Handling System
6.13      The marketing area of FACT in South India includes the four states
of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Mysore. Within this area, FACT
has established an extensive distribution network of godowns, wholesale and
retail dealers, and a marketing staff to service the more than 6,000 final
distribution points. At present the company markets about 460,000 TPY fer-
tilizers of which 250,000 TPY are purchased. Tonnages may increase to
about 700,000 TPY with Cochin I and about 1,000,000 TPY with Cochin II,
excluding amounts for seeding programs or other outside purchases.  To
handle this expanded tonnage, FACT expects to utilize its existing distrib-
ution network more efficiently and also to establish additional distribution
points.
6.14      The market share that the company expects to obtain in each of
the four southern states is shown below:
FACT Market Share by Area
Rail Freight                     Selling
% of Market      Avg. Cost         Sales          Points
Market            N  P205  K20         Rs/ton      Headquarters   Dec. 1970
Kerala            70   70    70         12         Trivandrum        3,000
Tamil Nadu        25   25    25         35         Madras            2,100
Southern Mysore  25   25    25          35         Bangalore           210
Northern Mysore  12    7      7         45         Bangalore    (inc. above)
Andhra Pradesh   12    7      7         45         Hyderabad           500
6.15      Kerala forms the principal marketing area.  At present FACT mar-
kets about 70% of the total supply to the state and its forecasts are based
on maintaining this percentage. No other producer can effectively compete
with FACT in Kerala due to the company's location advantage and its well-
established name. FACT has a large sales network in Tamil Nadu and Southern
Mysore and estimates that it will supply 25% of the total market demand.
The lower share is due to the longer freight distance involved and the com-
petition from Madras Fertilizer and Zuari Agro, both of which will be mar-
keting similar products.
6.16      The other marketing areas contain northern Mysore and Andhra
Pradesh. These are much farther from FACT and substantial competition may
be expected from Zuari Agro and from Coromandel. Therefore, FACT has esti-
mated that it will obtain only 12% of the nitrogen market and 7% of the
phosphate and potash market. The market penetration projected seems rea-
sonable for all areas.
6.17      FACT reports an average Rs 138/ton ($18.40/ton) distribution cost,
which includes charges for freight, storage, marketing overhead, credit and
dealer comnission. These costs compare favorably with marketing costs in



- 16 -
other countries. Distribution costs, plus sales and excise taxes, are
passed on to the farmer. About 70% of the fertilizer is sold under some
credit arrangement. Fertilizer credit is discussed further in paras. 6.24
and 6.25.
E.   NPK Seeding Program
6.18      Presently FACT sells the following tonnages of fertilizer annually:
NPK Mixtures                   110,000
Superphosphate                  20,000
Ammonium Phosphate              60,000
Ammonium Sulfate               100,000
Urea                           170,000
Total                     460,000
While sales of the above provide FACT witlh valuable marketing experience,
they provide little help in developing markets for the NPK's to be produced
in Cochin II. The analysis of the above NP and NPK mixtures varies but they
are generally much lower in nutrient content than those expected from the
project.
6.19      It will be necessary for FACT to develop a comprehensive seeding
program for Cochin II based on the import of grades conforming as closely as
possible to those to be produced. This is particularly important since most
grades are not now available to the farmers. The specific grades are listed
in Annex 4 along with detailed comments on the fertilizer requirements of the
area and the basis for the selection of the grades to be produced by the
project. To be successful this program should provide NPK fertilizers in
suitable grades in at least the following amounts (in tons per year):
FY 72                    25,000 -  50,000 NPK
FY 73                    100,000 - 150,000 NPK
FY 74                   200,000 - 250,000 NPK
FY 75                   As necessary to supplement production
During negotiations it was agreed that FACT will implement a suitable seed-
ing program and that the Government will import fertilizers for that purpose
as necessary.
F.   Sales Prices and Competition
6.20      Typical current retail fertilizer prices in India are:
Ex-plant prices
Source                  Grade                Rs/ton         US$/ton
Government Pool       14-14-14                 757            101
Government Pool       15-15-15                 832            111
Coromandel            28-28-0                1,270            170



- 1 7 -
Witlh the exception of 28-28-0, the grades proposed by FACT (Annex 4) are
not now marketed in India. Therefore, FACT calculated the current prices
for its NPK products based on the above prices of the Government pool and
Coromandel (Annex 4). The average grade of 19-23-11 would thus have an
ex-factory sales price of Rs 928/ton ($124/ton).
6.21      Fertilizer sales prices have been constant for about two years
during which time raw material prices on the whole have increased slightly.
Currently, only Coromandel is producing and marketing high analysis, urea-
based NPK fertilizers in India. When Madras and Zuari Agro come on strces
in 1971 and 1972 respectively with new NPK capacity, the price could rea-
sonably be expected to drop due to increased competition but this tendency
will probably be offset by the continuing shortfall in supply. IDA con-
cludes, therefore, that prices are likely to remain at about existing levels
and represent a reasonable basis for evaluating the project.
6.22      FACT will face major competition in its market area from Coromandel
and Madras but other producers will be less competitive. Zuari Agro will
market a bulk blend based on urea and ammonium phosphate. Although the
grades can be the same, bulk blends are not generally as acceptable as the
granular product that FACT will manufacture. Also, Goa and the nearby area
of Mysore are serviced only by narrow gauge rails so transportation becomes
a major problem for Zuari Agro.
6.23      Manufacturers in north India will not be able to compete very
well in South India due to higher freight costs and product disadvantages.
Thus, competition from Northern producers should have limited impact and
FACT should be able to sell its output within its marketing area at pro-
jected prices.
G.   Agricultural Credit
6.24      The importance of credit to fertilizer consumption is well recog-
nized in India. At present credit is provided by the commercial banking
system and by the GOI to cover purchases from the Government Pool. The
Fertilizer Association of India (FAI) has estimated total fertilizer credit
for India of Its 2,970 million ($400 million) in 1970/71. Based on consump-
tion forecasts, the requirements in 1974/75 will be approximateLy Rs 5,000
million ($670 million).  While availability of credit has thus far not
seriously restricted growth in fertilizer demand, continuing efforts will
be necessary if future consumption forecasts are to be met. To fulfill
this need FAI recommended comprehensive changes in the agricultural credit
policy of India including establishment of a Fertilizer Credit Guarantee
Corporation by the GOI. This corporation has not yet been established.
Other programs to improve fertilizer credit are being studied by GOI, the
State Governments, and the Reserve Bank of India.
6.25      FACT estimates its total fertilizer credit needs in the latter
1970's at about Rs 800 million annually, of which it expects to provide



- 118 -
about Rs 120 million from its own resources. The company's financial pro-
jections indicate that FACT can readily provide this amount. Total credit
will be supplied as follows (in Rs million):
Dealers                      200
Commercial Banks             400
Cooperatives                  80
FACT                         120
Total                  800
The above distribution of credit sources has been proposed by FACT to reduce
the amount of credit to be supplied by FACT and its dealers through increased
reliance on commercial banks. The company has been successful in involving
local banks in selected areas in extending fertilizer credit but this system
is not in wide use at present. FACI's marketing efforts depend on the avail-
ability of such credit, and the Government has agreed to provide adequate
working capital if funds are not available from commercial banking sources.
VII. OPERATING COSTS
A.   Raw Material Costs
7.01      Raw material costs represent about 70% of total production costs
and their impact on the company's profitability therefore is significant.
As noted before, the project is based on urea from Cochin I plus imported
phosphate rock, sulfur, potash and ammonia. At full production, annually
recurring foreign exchange expenditures for the imported raw materials alone
are approximately $21 million at present prices. Prices of raw materials
have fluctuated widely over the past two to three years which makes accurate
forecasts of raw material costs difficult. The following table shows the
present prices (actually paid by FACT and used in the financial forecasts)
for these materials and the price trend (used in the economic return calcu-
lations) expected by IDA.
Comparison of Present and Future CIF Prices
Present Prices
Delivered          Assumed Future
CIF          Plant Site              Prices
$/ton    Rs/ton       Rs/ton                $/ton
Phosphate Rock           30         227         245                   24
Sulfur                   36         270         290                   30
Potash                   53         400         423                   40
Ammonia (plus 60%
duty)                  37         278         318                  37
Urea (from Cochin I)       -         -          620 ($82.70)          60
There are no import duties on phosphate rock, sulfur and potash.  Other raw
materials, such as filler and coating agent, are available in India.



- 19 -
7.02      All imports of sulfur, phosphate rock and potash into India are
now channeled through the Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC),
a government-owned corporation which contracts for supplies from interna-
tional sources, usually under bilateral trade agreements. MMTC suplies
the materials to the users such as FACT at its import price plus a fee.
Present raw material prices are generally higher than current international
prices due to such bilateral arrangements. Ammonia will be supplied for
Cochin II through a long-term contract recently concluded between Iran and
GOI. GOI has agreed to permit import of all raw materials needed including
bagging supplies to the extent not available in India.
7.03      Present raw material prices are higher than those expected by
IDA in the longer run. IDA's assumptions are based on international prices
and assume that freight rates, which have greatly escalated over the past
two years, will decline to more normal levels. Present prices have been
used in financial projections to allow an accurate comparison with present
NPK prices. The effect of raw material and fertilizer price changes on
the company's profitability is discussed in Chapter VIII.
7.04      The project analysis does not include the possibility of supply
of phosphate rock from the mining project now being considered in Rajasthan
(para. 6.02). It is too early to predict the quantity and price of any
indigenous rock supply, and it is not anticipated that Rajasthan phosphate
rock will be supplied to FACT in the near future. Cochin II will, however,
be designed to permit use of Rajasthan rock when it does become available.
B.   Production Costs
7.05      Production costs were calculated for the average NPK grade to be
produced (19-23-11) and include costs for sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid.
Details of these costs are given in Annex 12 for various levels of plant
utilization and are summarized below for the normal operating level assumed
at 90% of design capacity.
Annual Production Costs- at 90% of Design Capacity
(Rs million)
NPK     Cryol:Lte
Variable Costs                               258.2       8.3
Fixed Costs                                   46.9       1.1
Total Production Costs                  305.1      9.4
/1 Includes depreciation, but no interest on long-term debt.
7.06      The high proportion of variable costs reflects the large raw ma-
terial component. Since the raw material costs used in the projections are
higher than the estimated trend, they should not increase further unless



- 20 -
affected by bilateral arrangements. Overall production costs are therefore
considered conservative. A direct comparison of Cochin II's projected op-
erating costs with FACT's existing cost of production is not possible since
the grades produced differ markedly in nutrient content and composition.
However, a comparison on a cost per ton nutrient basis indicates much lower
production costs at Cochin II than FACT can obtain at UDL Division. While
cryolite represents only about 3% of the project's output and will hardly
influence the company's profitability, it is nevertheless an important prod-
uct in that it is crucial in the production of aluminum and would help to
replace current imports.
7.06      The project will provide direct employment for about 500 skilled
and semi-skilled personnel. The lproject is capital intensive and labor costs
represent only a small fraction of operating costs. No attempt was made to
project employment created as an Lndirect result of the project in ancillary
industries.
VIII. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
A.   Financial Analysis and Sensitivity Tests
8.01      Detailed income statements for the project are contained in Annex
13. Summary statements of these forecasts are shown below:

8.02      The project shows a small profit in the first year of production
(FY 1975). Profits are expected to rise rapidly in the next two years as
production increases to 90%, and remain at a level above Rs 90 million



- 21 -
per year until FY 1980, when - after a tax holiday of five years - the
impact of taxes (about 55%) forces net profit down to approximately Rs 45
million per year.
8.03      Due to the relatively high selling prices of fertilizer :Ln India,
the project is very profitable and, after taxes become applicable, net pro-
fit equals 11% of sales and 24% of share capital. If Cochin II were carried
out in a separate corporation, it would have a quite satisfactory debt serv-
ice coverage of around 4.0 times in the early years when no taxes are paid,
and about 2.9 times thereafter.
8.04      The internal financial return (IFR) for the project has been calcu-
lated at 19.5%. The assumptions used in this analysis, as well as for the
sensitivity tests, are shown in Annex 14.
8.05      The project has been tested for various factors and is very sensi-
tive to changes in raw material and product selling prices. If raw material
prices are reduced to the level of the expected long-range trend, selling
prices could be decreased 7% without reducing the financial return. With
current raw material prices and a 10% reduction in selling price, the IFR
decreases to 9.3%.
8.06      The project is not appreciably affected by changes in production
levels. The IFR for a maximum of 80% production beginning in the second
year and 100% beginning in the fourth year are 16% and 21% respectively.
A project delay, however, is critical. A one-year delay with a resulting
15% cost overrun would decrease the IFR to 9.2%. If this delay were fol-
lowed by other adverse circumstances, such as a 10% decline in selling prices,
the project would show a negative return.
8.07      As shown in Annex 15, the profit break-even point for the project
at the assumed selling prices is 37% of capacity. At normal production the
project would break-even profitwise if NPK prices were reduced as much as
22%. The cash break-even point on the same basis including the service of
long-term debt would require sales at 32% capacity or an NPK selling price
of Rs 710/ton (22% reduction).
B.   Economic Analysis
8.08      The internal economic return (IER) for the project is 13.5% as
shown in detail in Annex 14 and is based on the following major assumptions:
(1) Raw material costs are the long range trend prices shown
in para. 7.01.
(2) The average selling price is equivalent to expected CIF
import prices of N (as urea); P205 (as phosphoric acid),
and K20 (as potash) in the proportions required for the



-- 22 -
project's average NPK formulation A2 notional manufac-
turing costs and profits if produced in a modern and ef-
ficient plant in one of the industrialized countries.
8.09      Although the above analysis has its shortcomings, it still offers
the best comparison with imported NPK products, since the grades to be manu-
factured at Cochin II are not avaLilable internationally. This evaluation
indicates that when using internaLtional input prices, the project would be
competitive with imported NPK fertilizers while earning at the same time
an acceptable economic return.
8.10      Sensitivity analyses of the economic return show the same trends
as the financial return with the project being very sensitive to relative
changes in raw material costs and selling prices. Again, a delay in project
completion reduces the return substantially to 6.0% and a delay coupled with
a relative selling price reduction of 10% results in a negative return.
Details of the sensitivity tests are contained in Annex 14.
8.11      As shown in Annex 16 the project would realize net annual foreign
exchange savings of $15.6 million at normal 90% production. The local cur-
rency expenditure required to achieve this savings is Rs 92 million ($12.2
million) per year.
C.   Imported Vs. Manufactured Phosphoric Acid
8.12      In considering Cochin II, an analysis has been made to see if a
more optimum solution would be to use imported phosphoric acid rather than
to produce acid from imported raw materials (phosphate rock and sulfur).
Essentially the decision to import phosphoric acid would save about $18 mil-
lion in capital costs, of which $4-6 million would be foreign exchange. How-
ever, local production of acid would save annually about $3.7 million in
foreign exchange operating costs, albeit at an increase in local costs of
about $3 million equivalent per year. Details of this evaluation are con-
tained in Annex 16.
8.13      As shown more fully in Annex 14, an economic return has been cal-
culated on a separate project to produce phosphoric acid. The return has
been based on two alternative assumptions of delivered cost of imported
P205 - $160 per ton and $150. The return at the higher cost is 13.7% and
at the lower 9.0%. The foreign exchange savings (para. 8.12), plus the
possible use of phosphate rock from Rajasthan support the decision to
produce rather than import phosphoric acid.
IX. FUTIURE PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION ON FACT

9.02      FACT is expected to show an operating profit in FY72, Cochin I's
first year of operation; however, this will be more than offset by interest
expense and a net loss for the year of Rs 17 million results. A net profit
of Rs 43 million is expected in FY73 which will increase in succeeding years
as Cochin I output increases and Cochin II comes on stream. Profit reaches
a peak in FY77 at a level of Rs 167 million when Cochin II reaches 90% ca-
pacity. Net profit is reduced in FY78 when income taxes are first applicable
and again the next year when the full tax impact is felt. In that year net
profit reaches a plateau of about Rs 90 million, or 11% of net sales. This
profit level is considered satisfactory.
9.03      The likelihood of FACT profitability being in line with estimates
rests primarily on its ability to complete Cochin II within the time and cost
now forecast, and to reach expected production levels at Cochin I and II.
UDL's contribution to profits is marginal and, after completion of Cochin II,
will amount to only about 7% of profit before interest and taxes, while those
from Cochin I and II are 38% and 55% respectively.
9.04      As the company's earnings improve, its cash buildup should enable
FACT to begin paying dividends on share capital. It has been assumed that
Rs 44 million, or 10% on share capital, will be paid each year beginning in
FY76. This will represent only about one-half of net profit after full
taxes are reached in FY79 and further payments may be possible.
9.05      After FY72 when some debt may have to be postponed (para. 4.08),
debt service coverage, Annex 19, is adequate at 1.6 to 1.8 times in FY73
and FY74 and above 2 times in each year thereafter. Since GOI has assured
IDA that FACT will have adequate liquidity during project execution, pro-
tection against the lower coverage in the first three years is provided.
9.06       Forecasted balance sheets for 1972-1987 are contained in Annex 20.
Pertinent data from these for FY72 through FY79 are as follows:

9.07      The long-term debt equity ratio improves from the present 65/35
to better than 50/50 by March 1974 and the current ratio improves to 1.5:1
by March 1975. These ratios assume deferment of Rs 85 million debt (see
para. 4.08) and no further increase in long-term funds above the the
financing for Cochin I and Cochin II. After 1974 the company's financial
position improves steadily and its long-term debt/equity ratio is forecasted
to reach 12/88 by FY79. Net working capital becomes positive by FY74 and
increases each year. Dividends and debt prepayments will not be permitted
if they would reduce the current ratio below 1.5 to 1.
X. RECOMMENDATIONS
10.01     During credit negotiations, agreement was reached between the
Government, FACT and IDA on the following principal points:
(i) GOI will furnish at least Rs 190 million in equity and
the balance (not less than Rs 150 million) in loan for
the project (para. 4.05);
(ii)  GOI will provide additional funds as necessary to complete
the project and Cochin I; assure a sound financial position
for FACT at the time Cochin II is completed; and maintain
an adequate liquidity position of FACT during project execu-
tion (para. 4.09);
(iii)  GOI will promptly issue import licenses as required including
such items on the "reserved list" which cannot be procured in
India without adversely affecting the project (paras. 5.05,
5.06);
(iv)  GOI will provide credit facilities for marketing of FACT's
fertilizers to the extent required (para. 6.25);



- 25 -
(v) FACT will implement satisfactory accounting and management
information systems by January 1972 (para. 2.07);
(vi) FACT will implement an appropriate seeding program including
necessary imports of NPK fertilizers (para. 6.19);
(vii) FACT will carry out the project according to its critical
path schedule (para. 5.04).
10.02     Completion of the following arrangements will be additional con-
ditions of effectiveness of the credit:
(a) FACT will have completed arrangements with the Cochin Port
Trust that terminal facilities will be permanently available
at the time required (para. 3.06);
(b) FACT and GOI will have completed arrangements regarding re-
szheduling FACT's debt that is in arrears as of March 31, 1971
(paras. 4.08 and 9.07);
(c) FACT will have completed arrangements for obtaining process
licenses, plant designs and technical assistance as required
and on terms that are satisfactory to IDA (paras. 5.01 and 5.02).
10.03          The project has a high priority in the Government's efforts
to increase fertilizer production. The project's attractiveness depends
largely on FACT's ability to complete construction on schedule and FACT
and the Government have agreed to take all necessary steps to complete
the project within the agreed time. With such assurances and those in-
dicated above, the project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit
of $20 million for relending under the terms described herein.

ANNEX 1
DESCRIPTION OF FACT's EXISTING OPERATIONS
The five operating divisons of FACT are described below:
A.   Udyogamandal Division (UDL)
UDL started commercial production in 1948 and since then has im-
plemented four expansion stages with some of the earlier plants no longer
in production. Over the past five years, FACT has invested Rs 200 million
in the UDL Division, tripling the gross fixed assets to Rs 300 million.
The UDL Division contains a number of small process units with an aggre-
gate capacity of 90,000 TPY N and 40,000 TPY P205. The major products are
ammonium phosphate (16-20-0 and 20-20-0), ammonium sulphate and single
super phosphate. The major production levels for FY 72 are expectetd to
average about 60-80% of design capacity, and in FY 73 and subsequent years
are forecasted at an average of 90% of the annual design capacity. These
improved efficiencies are obtainable with the Rationalization Program, see
Annex 1 Section F below. Earnings projections for UDL are based oni these
production assumptions.
Ammonia is produced in four separate units of which the oldest is
a 15 TPD NH3 electrolysis process which consumes large amounts of power.
Since FACT does not at present show each unit as a separate cost center,
the economics of this unit cannot be determined but it is difficult to con-
ceive that production from this plant is economical. Two ammonia units (80
and 140 TPD NH3) are based on partial oxidation of naphtha. This lprocess
is relatively expensive in part because it requires oxygen which has to be
generated in air separation plants; furthermore the units are small by com-
parison to plant sizes now available. The fourth unit (120 TPD NH3) is due
on stream during April 1971 at which time the oldest unit will probably be
phased out. The process employs naphtha reforming which is the most eco-
nomical design but the unit size is still small. Overall production cost
of ammonia from UDL will continue to be high even if all units were to
operate at design capacity. However, at 80-90% capacity UDL should be able
to produce NH3 at about $65-80/ton (Rs. 500-600/ton) and thus generate a
reasonable profit with the existing fertilizer prices in India.
Sulfuric acid is produced in four separate units, which together
have a capacity of 750 TPD H2SO4 and which all use the same basic process.
In addition, FACT purchases about 100 TPD H2SO4 from a nearby aluminum
smelter. The first two plants (68 TPD each) were part of the original
facilities. The last two plants (160 and 450 TPD) represent reasonable
modern design and size and can produce sulfuric acid economically or at
near design capacity. However, for the reasons stated before, it is impos-
sible to accurately assess their profitability.

ANNEX 1
Page 3
Phosphoric acid is produced in two plants, 25 TPD and 100 TPD
P205, both of which are very small by current design standards, but use
conventional and competitive technology. The operating level of these
plants has been low due to corrosion, mechanical problems, lack of - partly
imported - raw materials, and low operating levels of other plants.
Ammonium phosphate is produced in three granulation plants, all
considerably smaller than modern economic units. Their low operating per-
formance has been attributable to mechanical problems and non-availability
of intermediate feed materials from other units. When other units operate
satisfactorily, the ammonium phosphate plants should also operate at reason-
ably high capacity.
Ammonium sulfate is produced in two different processes. One unit
uses ammonia and sulfuric acid and produces product by direct neutralization.
This plant consumes sulfur which is imported. The other plant utilizes as
its source of sulfur by-product gypsum, or calcium sulfate, from the phos-
phoric acid plant. It was designed by FACT, has a much higher capital in-
vestment than normal but produces ammonium sulfate at a lower cost since
raw material costs are lower. The process is basically sound, although it
has operated at low efficiency and equipment size is small.
Single-super phosphate has been produced by FACT since initial
operation of the company in a conventional process of reacting phosphate
rock with sulfuric acid. The unit is typical of super phosphate factories
throughout the fertilizer industry. FACT operates the plant when raw mater-
ials are available. The projected production of 20% in 1971/72 is due to
shortage of phosphate rock grinding capacity which will be corrected in
1972/73.
FACT also produces minor quantities of other chemicals at UDL
including ammonium chloride, oleum (concentrated sulfuric acid), and sulfur
dioxide.
B.   FACT Engine       and Design Organisation (FEDO)
FEDO, the Engineering Division of FACT which was established in
1965, carries out engineering and construction work in the chemical indus-
try based on licensed processes and their own know-how. The FEDO personnel
are competent but the organization's depth in engineering staff is lacking.
FEDO, with a total technical staff of about 240, handles all of the expan-
sion of FACT as well as outside work. They are currently building a 100,000
TPY sulfuric acid plant in Trivandrum, a 115,000 TPY phosphoric acid plant
for FCI at Sindri, and the Cochin I project.
In addition to Cochin II FEDO has bid on other projects. It is
possible that FEDO could overextend its staff capabilities if too much
additional work is accepted. FACT is aware of this potential problem and
has agreed to consult with IDA before further major contracts are accepted
during engineering of Cochin II.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
On previous jobs, particularly Cochin I, FEDO has not handled
procurement and project delays very, well. It is difficult to assess fully
the 1-1/2-year delay at Cochin I but FEDO could have improved the schedule
by making a concerted effort to minimize delays by replacing orders, changing
specifications or expediting shipments. Part of these delays were caused by
import licensing or other procurement limitations outside FEDO's control;
nevertheless, to a major extent the delays are indicative of poor management
control.  FEDO should concentrate cn project schedule and effective use of
the project's critical path schedule. The Project Manager should be dele-
gated sufficient authority to identify potential delays early and undertake
corrective action.
FEDO has experience with each of the process units being considered
for Cochin II, although the only other large project they have managed has
been Cochin I. IDA considers FFDO capable, but considering the project's
size and their lack of depth in technical staff, several experienced person-
nel will be added to FEDO's organization to assist in the execution of the
project.
C.   FACT Engineering Works (FEW)
FEW is a small equipment fabrication division that manufactures for
FACT and other firms. FEW will not bid on any major equipment for Cochin II.
D.   Cochin Division
The Cochin complex is located about 20 km from Udyogamandal. Co-
chin I is a 200,000 TPY ammonia and 330,000 TPY urea project estimated to
cost about Rs 538 million ($72 million) including initial working capital,
interest during construction and market development expenses. This project
is being financed by Rs 126 million ($16.7 million) in Italian supplier cre-
dits and Rs 175 million ($23.3 million) in equity from GOI and Rs 237 million
($31.7 million) in loan from GOI. GOI has agreed to increase the equity por-
tion of the Cochin I project cost to 50% to improve FACT's financial position.
This adjustment in equity will be accomplished by the completion of the Cochin
II project. IDA's financial projections for the company (Annexes 18 and 20)
assume this equity ratio will be achieved by profits from UDL and Cochin I.
However, if insufficient profits are earned then the equity will be adjusted
by the form of new funds coming into the company or by restructuring the com-
pany's debt. The plant is based on naphtha from the adjacent refinery at a
price of Rs 110/ton ($15 per ton). The refinery is expanding its crude oil
capacity from 2.5 to 3.3 million TPY.
FEDO is the managing contractor and also engineered the ammonia
synthesis gas preparation unit based on ICI-Power Gas design. The ammonia
synthesis plant and the urea plant are being supplied by FCI and Montecatini.
The plant is expected to be completed in May 1971 and begin production in
,idid-1971.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
'rhe Montecatini ammonia design has not been proven in this size
plant and the ammonia/urea plant may have difficulty in coming on stream even
though a substantial number of expatriate personnel are being used for con-
struction and start-up. The operating factors assumed in preparing the finan-
cial forecast for Cochin I are: 50% of design capacity in 1971-72 (9 months);
75% in 1972/73 and 90% in 1973/74 and thereafter. On completion, Cochin II
will be transferred to this division.
E. Mark eting Division
FACT's Marketing Division is responsible for al,l fertilizer sales
from UJdyogamandal, outside purchases including seeding materials, and the
future sales of Cochin. Fertilizer research and market promotion are also
handled by this division. FACT markets only in South India.
F.   Udyo .mandal Rationalization Program
The operating and profit performance of UDL Division has been very
poor for the past few years. The IDA mission that assessed the company's
performance in 1969 found major problems in the following areas:
1)   Power supply
2)   Phosphate operations
3)   Ammonia operations
4)   Maintenance
5)   Small process units
6)   Management
As a result of the mission, FFDO and FACT prepared a comprehensive -program
for rationalizing or debottlenecking the UDL operation. A list of the major
projects to be undertaken together with their completion schedule is given
on the following page. Total expenditures of the program are about Rs 7.7
million ($1.0 million) including about Rs 1.0 million ($130,000) in foreign
exchange. These costs do not include most of the local construction costs
which are being absorbed in UDL's maintenance budget.

The Government has given its approval for the program and portions
have already been implemented. Items requiring foreign equipment and material
are being discussed with GOI and some import licenses have been issued. The
rationalization program represents a major step towards profitable operation
of UDL and it is expected to be substantially completed by the end of Fiscal
Year 1971/72.
Power is supplied from the Kalamassery power station of the Kerala
State Electricity Board (KSEB). Power distribution in Kerala has been ex-
periencing many interruptions and voltage dips. The principal causes are
inadequate protection from lightning. The UDL division, and specifically
the armonia and oxygen plants, is sensitive to power variations. The plant
has a small auxiliary power generation unit, but it would be prohibitively
costly for UDL to generate all its power requirements. The recent history
of power interruption as UDL is shown below:

/1   6 are attributed to labor strike at KSEB.
Some slight improvement is indicated due to changes already implemented by
FACT and KSEB. However, it will be late 1971 before any substantial improve-
ment in power supply can be expected. The problem of power supply in Kerala
was evaluated in 1969 by an Indian study commission and specific recommenda-
tions were made for both KSEB and the FACT/UDL electrical systems. The recom-
mendpd changes in the FACT power system were:
1.   Independent power supply to control circuits.
2.   Independent power supply to excitation motor-generator sets.
3.   Automatic voltage regulators for synchronous motors.
4.   Time lag relays for synchronous motors.
5.   Time lag under-voltage relays for induction motors.



ANNEX 1
Page 8
The recommended changes in the KSEl3 power system were:
1.   Operation of 110 KV bus at Kalamassery as an integrate(d bus.
2.   Carrier inter-trip facility on all inter-connecting feeders.
3.   Single pole opening and reclosing facilities for all feeder
circuit breakers.
4.   Automatic recording of power interruptions and voltage dips.
KSEB has completed some of the changes listed, and is now waiting for imported
components to complete the other improvements. FACT has installed time delay
relays as recommended on some motors but apparently not all. These relays
can correct for most short power dips, but FACT states that further improve-
ments to their internal electrical system cannot be done until after KSEB has
completed its changes. It is difficult to assess whether the recommended
changes will completely solve the power distribution problems or if more
fundamental and costly improvements are needed. The ammonia plants at UDL
are heavily dependent on continuous power supply for efficient operation
and power dips and interruptions have previously shut them down for 12-24
hours at a time. In addition to the electrical changes, FACT is presently
modifying their oxygen supply system so that most power fluctuations will
not bring down the ammonia plant completely. Other equipment modifications
should permit the ammonia plants to attain steady production by mid-1971.
From about 1967 to 1970, the phosphoric acid plant operated pri-
marily on rock which had a high chloride content and is very corrosive in
phosphoric acid plants. The corrosive nature of this rock is well-known
throughout the world phosphate industry. The phosphoric acid plant has
been severely corroded and, as a result, experienced long down times.  If
the phosphoric acid plant is not working then the downstream ammonium phos-
phate and ammonium sulfate plants cannot operate.  In addition, the ammonium
sulfate plant is affected by the quality of gypsum it receives when the
phosphoric acid plant does operate.  The percentage down time due to the
inferior rock supply is not known, but it obviously was high. Nor was it
possible to determine who initially ordered the rock, how quickly the cause
of corrosion was discovered, nor how effectively FACT tried to circumvent
its use.  The mechanical changes in the phosphate plant such as rock grind-
ing mill, new reactor, and the ground rock elevator should permit the phos-
phate plants to operate at close to design capacity.
The poor maintenance and operating control was noted in the earlier
Bank mission. FACT has set up a system for improving maintenance, and are
consulting with an instrument firm on instrumentation. Also, FACT and G0I
have agreed to employ three experienced fertilizer plant operators for 6-12
months to assist in the UD)L divisicin operations.  Negotiations are now und(er-
arv with Wellman Power Gas to supply these engineers.  The function of these
engineers would be to work with FA(T on maintenance, instrumentation, operation
[ln(i cost control.

The multiplicity of small units at UDL is inherent in the age and
growth pattern of FACT. These small plants are less efficient than modern,
single-train plants. T{owever, with good management control and completion
of the rationalization program, the plants can operate at a high rate and
reduce production costs substantially below their existing levels.

* Including ingredients from own production
** Excluding cost of purchased fertilizers
Note:  The company has reorganized the historical income statements to be consistent with the forecasted
statements, which show net sales (from operations) at ex-factory prices. Net sales exclude fertilizer
bought and sold (with the trading profit shown in other income), as well as distribution and selling
costs passed on to the purchaser. These other fertilizer sales, urea and fertilizer mixes, have
increased steadily from about Rs 29 million in FY 1966 to an estimated Rs 227 million in FY 1971.
However, profits from these trading operations are small and do not appreciably affect the company's
financial results.

Product Grades
The product grades recommended for production in Cochin II contain
six different grades of NP and NPK complex fertilizers in the following nu-
trient ratios, with percentages to total volume of complex fertilizers:
N :P :K
1 : 1   1              25%
1 : 1   0              15%
1   2 : 1              20%
1 : 2   0              15%
2   1   1              15%
1 : 2   2              10%
These ratios represent the accepted pattern for different crops in
the marketing area of the company and the relative quantities taken into con-
sideration in cropping pattern and areas under major crops. The grades and
tonnages can be adjusted to meet changing market preferences. The proposed
plant design is flexible, depending on the availability of raw materials,
and it is possible to make grades with nutrient ratios other than those indi-
cated above.
The existing product mix (including the Cochin I production) indi-
cates an imbalance in the combination of nitrogen, phosphate and potash. The
existing product mix offers a poor NPK ratio of 12:2:1. The proposed capaci-
ties of Cochin II will improve this position to an NPK ratio of 6:3:1. Such
an improved NPK ratio is advisable, both from the requirement of providing
balanced fertilizer nutrient to the soil and marketing requirements of pro-
viding a balanced product mix for easy market acceptability.
The fertilizer consumption trend in FACT's marketing area indicate
a definite trend towards urea, ammonium sulphate, NP and NPK complexes. The
NPK ratios and grades included in the product mix are in line with the ferti-
lizer recommendations for different crops in the marketing area. The popular
ratios of NPK recommended for the various crops in the area are 1:1:1, 1:2:1,
2:1:1 and 1:2:2. For potash rich soils, NP ratios of 1:1:0 and 1:2:0 are
generally recommended. Hence all these are included in the product mix.
Since many of the important crops in this area require an NPK ratio of 1:1:1
for basal application, a higher production is proposed for this ratio. The
ratio of 1:2:1 is taken as next in importance as this is generally recommended
for local varieties of paddy. The ratio fo 2:1:1 is preferred for crops in
areas without assured irrigation and where all the NPK required by the crops
are to be given in one basal application. The ratio 1:2:2 will cater to the
requirements of some specific crops like groundnut, vegetables, etc. The NP
ratios of 1:1:0 and 1:2:0 are :Lncluded for meeting the requirements of those
parts of the marketing area where soil is rich in potash. An analysis of NPK
mixture grades recommended for crops and their consumption in the marketing
area will show that these NPK ratios are the most popular ones. The product
mix also gives the maximum possible concentration of NPK in the various ratios
and, therefore, will offer economies in handling, storage and application
costs.  The product mix offered for production in Cochin II will satisfy mar-
keting requirements and crop requirements of the area.



ANNEX 5
TECHIICAL DESCRIPTION
COCHIN II PROJECT
A.   Production Facilities
The production facilities consist of four major process plants
and their associated services and offsites. The process plants are:
1)   Sulfuric acid plant
2)   Phosphoric acid plant
3)   Complex fertilizer granulation plant
4)   Cryolite plant
Sulfuric acid will be produced in a 33n,nn TTrY single stream plant,
based on elemental sulfur. FEDO has an arrangement with Chemiebau Dr. A.
Zicren Gmbll of West Germany, for design and engineering of sulfuric acid
plants in India. The process know-how will be supplied by Chemiebau and
the detailed engineering, procurement and erection will be undertaken by
FEDO.
Sulfuric acid is produced by melting sulfur and burning it in the
presence of controlled quantities of air. The combustion air is first dried
in a drying tower by contact with 94% sulfuric acid. The gases, at 900%C,
are cooled to about 400C in a waste heat boiler. The gases, which contain
8% So, are then passed through beds of vanadium pentoxide catalyst, to con-
vert {he sulfur dioxide (SO2) to sulfur trioxide (SO ). The heat evolved is
also recovered through heat exchangers. The SO is absorbed in 98% sulfuric
acid and product acid is drawn off from the circulating stream and cooled.
A part of the 98% sulfuric acid is recycled to the drying tower, taking back
portion of the 94% acid in the drying system, and adding water as required.
The gases, after absorption of SO3, are vented to the atmosphere through a
stack.
Phosphoric acid will be produced in a single stream plant, of
115,000 Tl'Y P 0 size. The plant, based on the Central Prayon Process, will
give a produc? acid containing about 35% P 20 , with a high recovery efficien-
cy. FEDO has an agreement with The EngineerKng and Industrial Corporation
(I'rayon) of Luxembourg, for building phosphoric acid plants. Prayon will
provide the process know-how and FEDO will do the detailed engineering, and
erection.
Phosphoric acid is produced by reacting phosphate rock and sulfuric
acid. Thic phosphate rock is ground to the required fineness and then reacted
with the phospho-sulfuric acid from the hemihydrate section, and the re-
cyclecl dihydrate slurry, in the attack tank. A portion of the 98% sulfuric
acid is also added and conditions are controlled to precipitate the calcitim
sulfate as dihydrate. A portion of the slurry from the attack tank is re-
cycled through an evaporator-cooler, to remove excess heat and water. The



ANNEX 5
Page 2
slurry from the attack tank is fed to centrifuges and is further clarified
by settling and taken otlt as product acid containing about 35% P 0 . The
slurry from the centrifuges is sent to the hemihydrate tanks. The5conversion
of dihydrate into hemihydrate is the key step, which differentiates this
process from the dihydrate process and improves recovery. The slurry con-
taining dihydrate and phosphoric acidl reacts with the balance of sulfuric
acid, at a higher temperature, in the hemihydrate section. The calcium sul-
fate dehydrate is converted into the hemihydrate form and then filtered,
using conventional filters. The filtrate, phospho-sulfuric acid, is returned
to the attack tank. A portion of the centrifuged phosphoric acid is con-
centrated in forced circulation evaporators to 54% P 0  to meet the needs
of the NPK granulation plants. 2 5
Complex Fertilizer (NPK) will be produced in a plant with two
identical streams with a total capacity of 485,000 TPY. FEDO has an agree-
ment with Wellman-Power Gas Inc. of the U.S. to supply the basic engineering
know-how.  FEDO will complete the design and erection with substantial as-
sistance from Wellman-Power Gas.  Complex fertilizers are produced by reacting
plhosphoric acid with ammonia and blending in the required amounts of urea
and potash.  Phosphoric acid is neutralized with ammonia in a 2-stage
reactor. Vapors from the reactor corntain free ammonia, which is recovered
by scrubbing with phosphoric acid, and the scrubbed gases are discharged
to the atmosphere. A drum type ammoniator-granulator will be used for gran-
ulation. The slurry from the neutralizer is further ammoniated in the gran-
ulator and mixed with recycled product, urea and potash. Vapors from the
granulator are fed into a fume scrubber, where ammonia is recovered by
scrubbing. The product from the grarulator is then dried, screened, and
cooled. A portion is recycled to the granulation step and a portion is
removed as product. The dryer and cooler will be handling dry solid
materials which creates dust. The gases from this equipment are passed
through cyclone separators, to remove a large portion of the dust and then
are scrubbed with a circulating stream of acid to remove the remaining dust.
The dust is recycled back to the process, thus, loss of material is minimized.
The product, from the bulk storage, is delivered to the bagging
plant where it is filled into 50 kg. polyethylene woven sacks or polyethy-
lene-lined bags through automatic weighing machines, stitched and dispatched
either to the bagged product storage or directly to the platform to be loaded
into wagons.
Cryolite is produced from the fluorine recovered from the phos-
phoric acid plant. A portion of the liquor in the fluorine scrubbing system
is pumped to the cryolite plant. This liquor, a 15-20% solution of hydro-
fluosilicic acid, is filtered and treated with sodium chloride to precipi-
tate sodium fluosilicate. The precipitate is slurried with water and then
ammoniated under controlled conditions to precipitate silica, which is fil-
tered off. The resulting solution of ammonium and sodium fluorides is reacted
with aluminum sulfate solution (prepared from sulfuric acid and hydrated



ANNEX 5
Page 3
alumina) precipitating trisodium aluminum hexafluoride (cryolite) and ammo-
nium aluminum hexafluoride. The latter is then converted to cryolite by
reacting it with sodium chloride solution. Cryolite is then filtered,
washed, dried and bagged. The proposed plant will produce 25 TPD of cryo-
lite.
B.   Offsites and Services
Imported raw materials required for the project are:
Rock Phosphate              347,000 TPY
Sulfur                      110,000 TPY
Potash                       91,000 TPY
Ammonia                      57,000 TPY
The above materials will come by ship to Cochin port, where faci-
lities are planned to unload and transport them to site as part of the pro-
posed project. Urea required for the project will be available from the
adjacent Cochin I Project and will be moved from urea silos to the NPK
granulation plant by a conveyor. Other materials such as filler, coating
agent, hydrated alumina, sodium chloride, soda ash, are available locally
and can be moved to the factory by road using transport contractors.
Cochin port authorities have agreed to allot one wharf in the har-
bor for unloading and handling imported raw materials and have agreed to
provide a mooring berth for over-side deliveries. Where raw material is
unloaded onto the wharf, there is sufficient area for building storages and
placing of unloading equipment. When the material is unloaded over-side
using ship's equipment the raw material will move directly by barge from
the ship to the site.
Solid raw materials will be unloaded at the berth using two mobile
grab cranes of 200-ton/hour capacity. Phosphate rock and sulfur will be
unloaded into overhead concrete silos, each of 2,500-ton capacity, the total
storage being 10,000 tons. From these silos, materials can be loaded di-
rectly into rail wagons or into barges and moved to the site. Potash will
be unloaded into a 4000-ton storage from which it can be loaded on rail
wagons. The railways have agreed to place 55-ton box type wagons on a
closed circuit for the movement of raw materials to the site. The materials
will be moved to storage through covered conveyors and then to consuming
plants by conveyors and elevators. Where material is moved by barges, they
will be handled by grabs and moved to storage through conveyors.
Ammonia will be received in refrigerated tankers and pumped into
an atmospheric pressure refrigerated storage tank of 10,000-ton capacity to
be constructed near the unloading berth. Ammonia will move from port to
site in 28-ton rail tank wagons and be stored in a 1,500-ton Hortonsphere.
The Indian Railways have agreed to provide chassis for the wagons on which
tanks will be placed by FACT, these being built to specifications given by
the railways.



ANNEX 5
Page 4
The present proposal is based on rail transport of all major raw
materials taking a comparatively less economical alternative. The Government
of India has agreed to improvements to a canal connecting the port with the
site. The State Government has assured FACT that the improvements can be
completed in 24 months, i.e. it will be ready for use for the movement of
material from port to site. With the alternatives of overside delivery from
ship to barge and the availability of arrangements for loading from berth-
storage direct to the barges, it will be more economical to move the material
by river.  However, as details are still under negotiations, the economics
of the project have been worked out on the costlier alternative of transport
by rail.
Power requirements for Cochin II are 17 MW which will be provided
tlhrough two 110 KV feeders from the Kalamassery Station of KSEB. Each line
can handle the full load of Cochin I and II. (Cochin I requires 25 MW).
The electrical drives in Cochin IT will be designed to handle voltage dips
that plague industrial facilities in Kerala. Cochin I has a 14 MW generator
that has excess emergency capacity and FEDO has included another small diesel
generator in Cochin II. These electrical facilities can keep critical units
of Cochin II operating during a power interruption. Although production will
be stopped by a power interruption, the units can be quickly brought back
on stream.  The Kerala State Electricity Board has indicated that power will
be made available to the project and the power tariffs applicable to non-
power-intensive, bulk consumers will apply to this project. This rate is
currently Rs. 220/KVAY and with existing surcharges is equal to about 4 paise
per KWH.
Steam requirements of the project will be supplied by the waste
heat boiler in the sulfuric acid plant and supplemented by a 50-TPH steam
generation plant. (Four package boilers of 12.5 TPM capacity). Total
steam required for the project will be 2,500 TPD of which 1,300 TPD will
be provided by the sulfuric acid plant.
Water for the project will be available from the artificial reser-
voir built for Cochin I. The reservoir, with a capacity of 1,050 million
gallons is fed by the two monsoons. In dry months, a State Irrigation Canal
feeds water into the reservoir through a channel capable of carrying 46 mil-
lion gallons per day. The total water requirement has been indicated to the
Kerala State Public Works Department to determine a suitable filling schedule
during the dry months. This matter is now being considered by the Public
Works Department.  The total water requirement for the present project will
be 4.3 million gallons per day and a provision to increase the present capa-
city of the reservoir has been included.
Fuel Oil will be available from the nearby Cochin refinery. About
150 tons a day will be required for the project.



ANNEX 5,
Page 5
C.   Pollution Control
Several effluent streams from the Cochin II factory will be poten-
tial pollution problems. The proposed project design controls these effluent
streams within normal industrial practice. The principal effluents are
fluorine, sulfur oxides and dust. It is understood from FACT that there
are no legal requirments now in force in Kerala for the control of these
materials.
The sulfuric acid plant burns sulfur and then recovers the result-
ing sulfur oxide by absorption. The efficiency is a minimum of 98'% recovery
with the balance of sulfur oxides being exhausted to the atmosphere; repre-
senting about 290 kg/hour of sulfur. This efficiency is typical of most
modern commercial sulfuric acid designs. The efficiency could be increased
by adding more absorption equipment but it is not considered necessary by
FACT nor the IDA staff.
The fluorine effluents are a result of the 3-4% fluorine contained
in phosphate rock that is liberated during processing. The exhaust gases
from the phosphoric acid plant are scrubbed with water and the gases that
are vented to the atmosphere contain about 50 kg/day of fluorine. This level
represents a high scrubbing efficiency and should be acceptable. Most of
the recovered fluorine is converted into cryolite. The NPK plant liberates
fluorine as it processes phosphoric acid. These gases are also scrubbed and
each plant discharges a maximum of 50 kg/day of fluorine to the atmosphere.
The NPK plant discharges small amounts of ammonia and dust, but
these materials are substantially completely removed by scrubbing.
Both the phosphoric acid plant and the NPK plant discharge large
volumes of water that are contaminated with fluorine. FACT has designed a
system that neutralizes any overflow from the water system to the river.
The overflow still contains about 150 kg/hour fluorine (as calcium fluosili-
cate). This amount should not be harmful and corresponds to normal commer-
cial practice in plants in the U.S. The system can easily be modified at
a later date if more stringent fluorine controls are required.
The phosphoric acid plant also discharges about 1,700 tons/day of
gypsum, a solid waste. The gypsum will be stored in a diked area and con-
verted to land fill as normally practiced in the industry. FACT later pro-
poses to convert a portion to ammonium sulfate and sell the resulting cal-
cium carbonate to cement factories.

NITROGEN AND PHOSPIIATE PRODUCTION
ASSUMPTIONS AND COMMENTS
The following comments refer to the forecasts made on nitrogen
production (Annex 8) and P205 production (Annex 9);
1.        Production figures for 1969/70 are actuals and for 1970/71 are
provisional estimates supplied by the Government. While overall totals for
1970/71 may be close to the 850,000 tons N and 260,000 tons P205 shown, pro-
duction for individual plants may vary. Production from existing plants
after 1971/72 has been estimated at about 90% of design capacity. In re-
cent years production in public sector plants has averaged 60-70% of capacity
and these estimates may therefore be high. llowever, any overestimate under-
states the gap between demand and supply and lends conservatism to the defi-
cit. A 90% production estimate for the private sector is considered real-
istic based on its operating performance.
2.        For projects under construction, production has been assumed at
50% of design in the first year, 70% in the second year, and 90% thereafter.
Three plants - Cochin I, Durgapur, and Madras - are substantially completed
and start-up by summer of 1971 seems probable. The estimated start-up of
Barauni and Namrup is less certain, but it is assumed for spring of 1972.
Work at Zuari Agro is on schedule with start-up scheduled for summer of 1972.
3.        The 11 projects designated as probable for the near future are in
various stages of negotiation and IDA's assessment of the start-up dates
varies somewhat from GOI estimates. In each case production is assumed at
50% first year, 70% second year, and 90% thereafter once production begins.
The three projects assumed to be in production in 1974/75 must begin con-
struction in 1972. Of these Cochin II should start construction in mid-1971
and negotiations appear well-advanced at the Gorakhpur and Trombay plants of
FCI. The project and financing plans for three projects, Nangal Expansion,
IFFCO and Haldia, must be completed by early 1972 if the projected 1975/76
start-up schedules are to be met. Plans for Coromandel Expansion, SPIC
(Tuticorin) and Mangalore are considered less certain and are projected for
1976/77 start-up. Two plants in the "probable category" are coal-based
ammonia plants with a total capacity of 460,000 TPY N. The technology of
these plants is not commercially proven and the plants are much larger than
any undertaken by FCI thus far. Start-up has been assumed for 1976/77.
4.        A number of other projects have been suggested for the longer-
range. The tentative nature of the plans for these projects make forecasts
highly unreliable so they have been grouped together with arbitrary aggre-
gate production schedules assumed at 10%, 20%, and 30% in 1976/77, 1977/78,
and 1978/79 respectively.
5.        There is little difference in the aggregate figures between
IDA's projection of supply and that of the Government in the early years.
Beginning in 1974/75, the difference becomes increasingly greater., due to






ANNEX 8
Page 3
different forecasts of completion dates for various plants. These fore-
casts (Annex 8 and 9) represent IDA's best estimate of the production
that India can reasonably be expected to achieve. If the 90% capacity util-
ization assumption is reduced to 80%, then the production figures will be
approximately 10% less. The project start-up dates assumed could vary either
way and give an estimated t10% difference in the forecasts.
6.        Progress in fertilizer production in India has been disappointing.
This is true both for the public sector, where production has been below ex-
pectations and where completion of new projects has been delayed, and the
private sector, where only one plant is currently under construction and
only one plant, IFFCO, seems likely in the near future. If India is to nar-
row its supply gap, new projects must be implemented at a much faster pace
than projected. Every effort should also be made to improve production
levels at existing plants. The deficits forecasted in the Bank estimate
indicates the magnitude of the problem India faces in meeting its fertilizer
requirements.
7.        Pertinent data on the nitrogen capacity of the public and private
sectors in India are given below:

8.        The present division of nitrogen plants show about 70% of N capac-
ity in the public sector.  This percentage is likely to be increased over the
next few years as new plants are completed.
9.        The high priority for India's self-sufficiency in fertilizer produc-
tion suggests that private sector industry should be encouraged as well as
public sector projects. Given the limited resources of India, the fertilizer
industry should have as broad a base as possible.



ANNEX 8
Page 4
10.       The public sector projects show increasing reliance on one company,
FCI; with 8 plants completed or under construction and another 6 planned for
the near future. The Government should review this situation to determine
whether one company is the most appropriate vehicle for expansion of the
industry.
11.       Also critical to India's fertilizer production is its recent de-
cision to build extremely large-scale coal-based ammonia plants. Whether
this is appropriate in India, considering that the technology has not been
proven commercially, should be given thorough study before the projects are
committed.
12.       Foreign exchange financing of fertilizer plants in India in recent
years has come from a variety of sources. The principal one recently has
been Italian Credits for the four urea plants now under construction in the
public sector - Cochin I, Durgapur, Barauni and Namrup. US AID supplied
funds for Trombay plant of FCI but has not participated in further financing
of FCI plants due to problems related to choice of engineering firms. US
AID also participated in the Coromandel project in the private sector and
assisted the Madras plant now under construction. It is considering financ-
ing for the IFFCO project, which may also have finance from the U.K. Govern-
ment. Japan has given credits for three Japanese built plants, Gorakhpur,
GSFC, Baroda, and Kota. Foreign exchange for Indian Explosives at Kanpur
and Zuari Agro was supplied by IFC. In several cases foreign equity sponsors
also supplied foreign exchange.

COMMENTS ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
Case I is a test to see how much the selling prices could be
reduced without the IFR decreasing, if imported raw material costs follow
the long-range trend used in the IER.
Case II indicates the impact of a one-year delay in the project
with a 15% overrun. With the budget estimates being conservative and
project execution receiving full support from GOI, no significant overrun
or lengthy delay is foreseen.
Case III (80% production) shows that both the IFR and IER are
still satisfactory at the production.
Case IV (100% production) is possible but not considered likely
due to the wide range of blends and consequent downtime.
Case V (10% reduction in selling prices) can be considered un-
likely as prices should not fall to this extent unless costs are similarly
reduced. The test indicates that prices could decline somewhat in the face
of competition and the project still show acceptable returns.
Case VI (10% increase in prices) is not likely although prices
could increase somewhat in view of stable prices in the last 2-3 years.
This will depend upon supply factors.
Case VII (15% overrun, one-year delay and maximum production
80%) shows that the combination of overrun, delay and production diffi-
culties could make an otherwise acceptable project marginal.
Case VIII (15% overrun, one-year delay and 10% decrease in
prices) for the IFR is not considered likely as the price-cost relationship
should continue. For the IER, however, international prices could be lower
than calculated by IDA staff.
The senistivity test on the phosphoric acid production as a
separate project has been performed using a 6% drop in the selling price.
The test shows the project returns 9% at $150 FOB per ton. Phosphoric
acid has been contracted for Indian delivery at $135 per ton CIF. However,
it is probably that a fair price for use in an economic return would be
$145 per ton to which $5 to $15 would have to be added for local costs,
assumed in this case to be borne by an importer with storage facilities,
transport costs, and overhead.
