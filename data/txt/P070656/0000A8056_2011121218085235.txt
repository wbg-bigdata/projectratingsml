                         The development objective of the proposed Forest and Environment Policy Development Grant (FEDPG) is to strengthen public and private efforts to achieve
                         socially-, economically-, and ecologically-sustainable use of national forest and wildlife resources.
                         Has the Program Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Program?

                         progress has been made concerning the 6th trigger with respect to the signing of the final concession agreements for all 65 FMUs (Forest Management Units - UFA in French)
                         awarded before January 2002 with companies having fulfilled their obligations; and taking appropriate measures against companies in violation of their obligations. The 6th trigger
                         will not be met before the project closing date of December 31, 2011.

                         Despite the non-achievement of all the triggers of the second tranche, the Forest & Environment Development Program (FESP) has contributed substantially to strengthening public
                         and private efforts to achieve socially-, economically-, and ecologically sustainable use of national forest and wildlife resources (PDO). It has also allowed a substantial improvement
                         of capacity for operational planning, financial management and Monitoring & Evaluation of the MINFOF, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MINEP) and other associated
                         departments.
