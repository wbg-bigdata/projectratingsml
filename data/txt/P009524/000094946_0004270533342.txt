11.  As well as the effect of implementing road infrastructure, the likely impacts of management
strategies were also assessed. These strategies included:
.  Better enforcement of vehicle condition regulations such that fuel consumption and
emission levels would reduce; and
Achieving modal shifts from smaller vehicles to larger vehicles i.e. from 3-wheelers and
passenger cars to buses.
12. Perhaps the main finding from this work is that measures to improve vehicle condition are
likely to be more significant than traffic management improvements or modal shifts. Within a
"vehicle condition" strategy, the major emphasis should be on improving the performance (in
pollution terms) of 3-wheeler 2-stroke vehicles. Several measures have been recommended for
consideration such as:
*  Encouraging the use of higher quality oils;
* Banning the use of 2-stroke engines for new vehicles; or
*  Restricting 2-stroke powered vehicles to local trips as feeder services to bus routes.
13.  Air pollution is not the only environmental issue associated with transport infrastructure
development. The study reveals that in some locations, open spaces are affected (positively or
negatively) and this is weighted against the expected transport benefits.
14.  Mitigation measures against probable increase in noise pollution levels at flyovers where
these are located near high-rise commercial and residential buildings may be provided by in-built
noise barriers with the structures and creation of effective sound barriers by planting leafy plants on  ,
the medians and roadsides.
15.  As regards biological environment, extreme care has been taken to minimise the negative
impact. In making proposals for infrastructure improvements in road intersection geometry and
design, minimum number of the existing trees of economic value have been earmarked to be
removed as being unavoidable. As regards smaller plants on the road sides, re-siting will be done
without destroying it. Beyond this, no fragile ecosystem has been disturbed.
16.  The findings from environmental evaluation matrix which addresses both 'without' and 'with'
project scenario indicate a substantial gain in EIV units which can be termed as beneficial impact.

2. Introduction
17   DITS Consultants (1994) identified that Urban transport activities contributes maximum
environmental impact to the people of Dhaka Urban area. This area, which covers approximately 4
sq. miles (10 kM2), constitutes the heart & central business district of Dhaka. Much of this area has
been developed after partition in 1947 and substantial investment in terms of buildings & widening
of several roads has been carried out. Continuous development of this area is evidenced in the new
multi-storeyed construction mushrooming all over the place, changing the skyline, land use, traffic
and environmental character at a repaid rate. Old Dhaka, located south of Fulbaria, also been
rapidly developed/redeveloped, without commenmorate increase in infrastructure capacity resulting in
acute congestion. Some of this congestion and generated slow moving non-motorised traffic spill
over into new Dhaka, causing capacity constraints in some of the main arterial.
18.  Morphologically, post 1947 development of Dhaka has taken place along the south-north, &
south - north west corridor extending to nearly 30 km. The CBD, however, has continued to grow
vertically in the southern-most portion of these linear corridors. Naturally, the entire thrust of
movement is towards this central employment and activity centre. Increasing affluence has caused
greater demand on motorised transportation infrastructures. However the mixture of motorised and
non-motorised traffic, where cycle-rickshaws predominate, create conditions of chaos, congestion
and accidents. Since the cycle-rickshaws provide the cheapest mode of public transport, it is in
greater demand by the ascending scale of economic well being (ref.: DITS study of distribution of
trips of different income groups), and cycle rickshaws constitute between 60% to 90% of total
PCE's.
19.  Thus, although the road infrastructure is quite substantial, and architecture of Dhaka is of
significant value, the entire area has a chaotic environment with traffic snari up, delays and air
pollution by idling vehicles. Bringing order to this area calls for a comprehensive interface study
between the traffic modes & volume, land use, built form & traffic, capacities of carriageways under
alternate scenarios of land use and modal split.
20.  The traffic congestion has been found responsible for increasing air and noise pollution
caused by the older vehicles and 2-stroke engine transport vehicles. Moreover, the existing number
of Motor vehicles and N.M.V. is about 600,000 and their haphazard movement in the roads
increased the constant traffic jam in the existing narrow roads of the city. The problem of traffic
congestion and uncontrolled vehicle exhaust emission made life miserable for this city dwellers
causing threat to health and economic loss as well.
21. Therefore, as per recommendation of DITS Consultants, priority schemes or Immediate Action
Plan (IAP) has been taken up to partially get rid of this traffic congestion problem by implementing
some infrastructure development works on an emergency basis. The development of roads and
planning of a traffic engineering and management program aimed at increasing road capacity,
vehicle speeds etc., aimed at reducing the environmental impacts and improving socio-economic
status of urban life.
22. This study intends to present a detailed Environmental Impact Analysis (EIA) of the priority
schemes taken up by the Govt. under DUTP-II, which will be carried out as per World Bank's
Environmental Assessment Source books, 1991 and OD-4.01 and OD-4.30, both for Development
and Resettlement works.

2.1  Terms of Reference (TOR)                                                                 I
23.   During the feasibility study, DITS-1994 and DUTPI-1996 have identified many issues
relating to engineering and environmental aspects needing more detailed investigation during the
detailed planning, design and implementation phases. Based on this analysis' the TOR has been
framed for this DUTP-II, those are particularly related to the project components and re-settlement
tssues. The consultant is supposed to address the relevant environmental inmpact during civil
construction works plus impacts during re-settlement issues, including environmental management
action plan and monitoring plan.                                                              3
2.2  Scope of Works
24. The scope of works for environmental impact assessment and management action plan for
DUTP-11 comprises the following main tasks:
(A)   Air quality level at base year 1997-98. which include base line data collection, inventory of
vehicles, existing emission standards, measurement of ambient air quality and vehicle air  3
quality at selected major intersections using Govt. supplied equipment, air quality monitoring
program etc.
(B)   Environmental screening of the project components to assess the probable positive and   U
negative impacts which are likely to be caused from it and to give weight for environmbntal
design either for reducing the adverse impact or enhancing the beneficial impacts.
(C)   Mitigation measures for adverse impacts caused out of project components by
(i)    Environmental design                                                            1

(iii)   Framing Rules and Regulation for mitigating long term impacts
(D)   Environmental Management Action Plan
For Management program for implementation and supervision of each component of works:
(i)    Preparing monitoring program during construction and during 0 & M period.
(ii)   Institutional strengthening and training requirement of the implementing authorities
(iii)   Formation of environmental unit & scope of works.
2.3 Policy, Legal and Administrative Framework under which the EIA is prepared
25.  In connection with this environmental studies and management action plan of DUTP - II, the
following polices, legal and administrative frameworks of Bangladesh have been consulted in
connection with air pollution and noise pollution.
(i) Environmental Policy - 1992 and Implementation Activities, Ministry of
Environment and Forest, Bangladesh.
(ii) Motor Vehicle Act - 1984 (revised), BRTA, Bangladesh.
(iii) Environmental Conservation Rules 1997, Government of Bangladesh.
26. But there is no standard guidelines for Bangladesh to prepare EIA for any development works
and no sectoral guideline for development of urban transport of Bangladesh is available.

3. Description of the Project
3.1  Project Background
27.  The Dhaka Urban Transport project (DUTP) has been constituted to arrive at improvement
programmes & militating measures, in order to alternative chaotic traffic condition and result in
environmental improvement. In order to evaluate the benefits of development proposals
-Environmental Assessment is carried out, not only to establish the benefits, but also the arrive at
mitigating measures for advise impacts. Environmental assessment comprises the analytic functions
of three sequential elements identification, prediction and evaluation. Identification essentially
revolves around characterising the existing environment and those components of a development
project that may have an effect on environment. This in known a Box line study, where in addition to
formulating a factual base, impact values of different factors are identified. Prediction of the impact
of proposed action depends on addressing the impact values against the action parameters. The
cumulative values of predicted impact in used for evaluation and identifying mitigation measures.
28.  In this case the project. having made detailed study of various alternations have narrowed
drown to the proposals for improvement of 20 intersection & construction cf two fly-overs. The
objectives of intersection improvements identified by DUTP, are as the following: (i) realignment of
approach roads, (ii) widening of approach road, (iii) installing traffic divides, traffic signals, (v)
construction and improvement of footpaths, (vi) improving storm water drainage, (vii) providing for
additional lanes of traffic, (viii) improving and moving street fighting, (ix) improving and providing for
left turn corner lanes. However, a study of the locations of these intersections reveal that they are
part of a closely knit network, those roads are major article roads proving, in the main, south -north
axis. Also, these roads serve all the major land uses abutting them as well as within the grid formed
by these networks of roads. Unfortunately no data is available on the land uses, traffic generation
pattern of these land uses, potential for further development. The assessment methodology is
therefrom constrained by these factors. This is particularly true for assessment of environmental
impact assessment.
29.  Since Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh, and a primate city, it is likely to grow at a rapid
rate. ADB has recently forecast Dhaka's population by 2021 to be around 24 millions, i.e. almost
these times the current population. It is imperative that as capital city, it must project an image, a
quality of environment, ambience in its space and architecture. Therefore, the present proposals
should be an integral part of the vision for the future. The structure plan for Dhaka needs to be
related to this project. Any major structural adjustment, in terms of mass rapid transit system,
creation of alternative focus for central area functions may have impact. In the absence of these
insights, the evaluation is limited to the concern of the project.
30   The rapid growth of Dhaka City population is directly related to the increase in vehicular traffic
to meet the growing transport demand of its people. Thus huge number of motorised and non-
motorised vehicles are plying together on the city roads and constant traffic congestion are created
in every road intersections resulting serious air and noise pollution, causing threat to the health of
the city people.
31.  The main reasons for traffic congestion are:
(I)    Narrow road
(II) Increased traffic volume
(III) Poor intersection design and geometry



DU TP l1 Draft Final Report: Appendix - K Environmental Action Plan          Page 6 of 75
(IV)  Road blockage by haphazard parking of vehicles                                             I
(V)   Amalgamated traffic flow by mv & nmv etc.
(VI)  Indiscriminate road crossing by the pedestrians
(VII)  Lack of private buses and truck depots.
32. DITS in the year 1994, identified these specific causes of such traffic congestion and
recommended an Immediate Action plan (IAP) for early development of some component programs.
Out of which construction of infrastructure components were given the top priority and DUTP-I
reviewed these components by conducting detailed field-survey and recommended an investment
project for early implementation. The present DUTP-11 is concerned with the planning, design and
implementation of many of the IAP recommendations of DITS and DUTP-I respectively. It is
expected that with the completion of 8 (eight) primary components of work under DUTP-II,
environmental pollution e.g. air pollution and noise pollution, of Dhaka City will be reduced to a great  U1
extent assuring better health to the city people.
3.2  Project Category
33.  The present DUTP- Phase-ll is concerned with the planning, design and implementation
phase, recommended by the DITS and DUTP-I along with some relevant environmental and re-
settlement studies which are appropriate during this phase. Under this DUTP-II, there includes 8
(eight) primary components and more than 50 (fifty) secondary components of civil construction
infrastructures, for the improvement of urban transport system. During implementation of the above
works, environmental impacts from civil construction works plus impacts resulted from resettlement
issues may be caused whose detail studies will be performed as per World Bank Guide line OD.4.00
and OD-4.30.
34.  The environmental impact have been screened out by field survey for each and every
individual Components in respect of physical, biological, socio-cultural and health environmental
issues and found that there no significant impacts caused on the above environmental issues
except few impacts which are very minimal in nature and easily mitigable.
35.  Hence this type of project falls under category 'B" of the World Bank Guidelines-OD-4.00
Annex-3, because temporary impacts caused during construction period are only for the project
oreparation. As such, this project may only perform environmental impact analysis.
3.3  Project Components and Locations
36.  Dhaka Urban Transport project phase-l1 is concerned with the detailed engineering and
design works for the road improvement and traffic management program termed as immediate
action plan (IAP) as recommended by the DITS Consultants in 1994 and also by the DUTP-_
Consultants in 1996. The urban transport program involves widening of existing roads, new link
roads, construction of bridges and widening of bridges, construction of fly over, foot overpass,
orovision of separate NMT routes, construction of foot-path, improvement of Bus terminals,
Drovision of city bus terminals, provision of truck terminals, parking spots for MV & NMV and
)rovision of standard vehicle repairing workshops at each bus/truck terminals and depots. These
-nprovement works may have an expected improvement results for controlling air, noise, water and
;oil pollution of Dhaka urban area.
7.  Out of above improvements, the following infra-structure component have been taken up in
and for improvement work, on priority basis.

4. Environmental Assessment
38.  The Dhaka Urban Transport project (DUTP) has been constituted to ariive at improvement
programmes & militating measures, in order to alternative chaotic traffic corndition and result in
environmental improvement. In order to evaluate the benefits of development proposals
Environmental Assessment is carried out, not only to establish the benefits, but also the arrive at
mitigating measures for advise impacts. Environmental assessment comprises the analytic functions
of three sequential elements identification, prediction and evaluation. Identification essentially
revolves around characterising the existing environment and those components of a development
project which may have an effect on environment. This in known as a Base Line study, where in
addition to formulating a factual base, impact values of different factors are identified. Prediction of
the impact of proposed action depends on addressing the impact values against the action
parameters. The cumulative values of predicted impact in used for evaluation and identifying
mnitigation measures.
39.  In this case the project, having made detailed study of various alternatives, have narrowed
drown to the proposals for improvement of 20 intersection & construction of two fly-overs. The
objectives of intersection improvements identified by DUTP-II, are as the following  (i) realignment
of approach roads, (ii) widening of approach road, (iii) installing traffic dividers and traffic signals,
road signs, railings and pedestrian crossings, (iv) resurfacing the road pavements, (v) construction
and improvement of footpaths, (vi) improving storm water drainage, (vii) providing for additional
lanes of traffic, (viii) improving and moving street lighting, (ix) improving and providing for left turn
corner lanes.
40.  However, a study of the locations of these intersections reveal that they are part of a closely
knit network, those roads are major arterial roads providing, in the main, south -north axis. Also,
these roads serve all the major land uses abutting them, as well as within the'grid formed by these
network of roads. Unfortunately no data is available on the land uses, traffic generation pattern of
these land uses, potential for further development. The Assessment methodology, is therefore,
constrained by these factors.
41.  Since Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh, and a primate city, it is likely to grow at a rapid
rate. ADB has recently forecast Dhaka's population by 2021 to be around 24 millions, i.e. almost
three times the current population. It is imperative that as capital city it must project an image, a
quality of environment, ambience in its space and architecture. Therefore, the present proposals    [
should be an integral part of the vision for the future. The Structure Plan for Dhaka needs to be
related to these project. Any major structural adjustment, in terms of mass rapid transit system,
creation of alternative focii for central area functions may have impact. In the absence of these   !
insights, the evaluation is limited to the concern of the project.

Environmental impact values ascribed to all parameters.
Determination of baseline impact values for all baseline parameters.  The
distribution of impact values to each parameter cumulatively indicates the
state of the environment.
Assessment of Impact due to proposed improvements & compared against
base line values.
4.1.3 Evaluation criteria:
The resulting matrix will show the quantitative index of change in different
components of the project. The indicators will be:
Positive high values will justify the project intervention by the component.
Poor values will indicate increased need for mitigating measures.
Negative values will indicate adverse impact by the proje!ct component which
will draw attention for review and dropping of the concerned project
intervention.
Mitigation measures for adverse values will be formulated .
Cumulative positive value will indicate quantitative index of positive impact to
be attained by the project on its entirety.
Cumulative negative value will indicate quantitative index of negative impact
to be attained by the project in its entirety which will call for further mitigation
measures and review of design and concepts.
4.2 Formulation of Environmental Evaluation Matrix
42.  The EE is used to evaluate the expected further condition of environmental quality, both 'with'
and 'without' the project. The difference in Environmental Impact values (EIV) between these two
conditions constitutes either an adverse impact, which corresponds to the loss of EIV, or a beneficial
impact with corresponding gain of values.
Mathematically, this process may be represented as follows:
El         (Vi)1 wi-     _  (Vi)2 Wi
Where:
El = environmental impact.
vi), Value of environmental quality of parameter i with the project

(vi)2 = Value of environmental quality of parameter i with the project                             i
wi = relative weight (Importance) of parameter i
m = total number of parameters.                                                                    I
43.  The process involves preparation of scaling and weighing checklist. It provides description of
the environmental parameters that are included in the checklist and instructions for their relative
scaling with respect to other perimeters and for assignment of important units.
44.  Due to paucity of data and constraints of time it was proposed to create a composite matrix
which covers the most essential parameters, both for establishing base line as well as for assessing
impact. This assessment has four stages (i) establishing base lie for existing environmental quality,  I
(ii) evaluation of proposed design of intersection improvement & fly-overs, (iii) impact during
construction period, and (iv) post construction impacts & mitigating measures. The impact values
were to be subjective based on value judgement, in a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the least & 5 is the
maximum.
45.  The relative weight of a parameter is culture dependent. Assuming this to be similar to that of
India, it could be adopted from parallel studies carried out in India. But these values were not
available.
46.  However, all parameters have been assumed to be of equal weight for the purpose of this
study. This, in fact, is a very approximate simplification.

48.   The existing traffic carrying capacity of the carriage-ways of various links &  intersection
equires estimation, as it is a  critical factor in traffic environment. Since  traffic consists of
)eterogeneous modes, each  mode  is given  equivalence factor so  that the  volume  can  be
,onsidered as a homogeneous flow. Substantial variation (ref. table: 12, PCE: comparative values)
s observed between different standards, giving widely varying PCE values & consequently carriage-
vay capacity. Since Dhaka has a very large volume of non - motorised transport, who are mainly
esponsibie for the chaotic condition, assumption of lower PCE values can have dramatic impact on
.epacity values. Unrealistic values may lead to erroneous results.

49. Also, it is noticed that the carriage-way width is not uniform. Three lanes require 3.5 x 3 m =
10.5 metres. Marginally larger width has no impact on traffic carrying capacity. In such cases the
surplus land may be added to footpath or the central verge, to allow for landscaping. The design
impact over the link thus needs careful EA.

52.   The foregoing set of tables are designed to establish base line data & subjective impact
values of various occurrences. In the light of local knowledge the values have been varied. As the
preparation of base line data is prerequisite for preparation of EA the methodology adopted here is                      R
designed for repaid assessment, & does not deal extensively with all the parameters. The base-line
data prepared so far, though inadequate for EA, cannot be meaningfully used to evaluate the
environmental condition or its impact.   However some indicative values for the weighing factors
have been calculated using the available baseline data and the proposed improvements on the
infrastructures. These values, although very inadequate, show some quantitative index of change in.
different components of the project as a result of DUTP-11 interventions. These are presented in                         l

5. Air pollution from Dhaka's Transport System
53. Air pollution caused by motor vehicles follows a distinct cycle: emission of pollutants
(depending on type of vehicle, type of engine, engine maintenance, and fuel quality; propagation in
the air (depending on the local topography, temperature, rainfall, and wind); and reception by
humans, soil, fauna, and flora.
54.  Motor vehicle exhaust emissions are the major contributor to air pollution of Dhaka
city. The severity of air pollution of Dhaka city has been observed to be depending on the
following factors:
*    poor quality of vehicles e.g. old and defective vehicles on road.
Rapid growth of 2 - stroke engine vehicles e.g. Baby taxi/Tempo/Motor Cycles etc.
*    Use of additive fuels- e.g. leaded petrol and sulfur mixed diesel fuel.
*    Slow driving speed at traffic congested spots and road intersections.
(1)    More than 230, 000 numbers of vehicles are plying in the city road of which about 70 - 80%
are old and defective, over 5-10 years of age. Excessive exhaust emissions are produced
from these vehicles causing severe air pollution.
(2)   About 45,000 Nos. Baby taxis/Tempos and 80,000 Nos. Motor Cycles are plying in the road.
They are powered by 2-stroke engine and emit excessive exhaust of unburnt fuels with white
smoke which are 1 0(ten) times higher than those of 4-stroke engine vehicles of equal power.
(3)   The use of leaded petrol (0.10 g/l) in the gasoline fueled vehicles emit .volatile lead
compounds which are serious air pollutants. Again sulfur mixed diesel fuel (0.5%) in
Bangladesh used in heavy duty vehicles e.g. buses and trucks emit air pollutants like S02
along with TSP, NO, and VOC and black smoke.
(4)   At slow driving speeds, LDV emit maximum levels of CO, HC, CO2 in the traffic congested
intersections and spots, while NO, emission has been observed to be highest at higher
driving speeds.
55.  For the above causes, serious air pollution is marked at each road intersections & bus
terminals. Affecting thousands of people like passengers, pedestrians, road side shop-keepers and
road side dwellers.
5.1 Motor vehicle exhaust emission
56.  Efficiency of internal combustion engines and character of fuels are the main factors for
producing typical vehicle exhaust emission. Leaded petrol and sulfur-contained diesel fuel emit
lead compounds and sulfur dioxide with the exhaust emission. petrol driven LDVs normally emit CO.
I-C, NO., lead compounds, CO2 and SPM while diesel driven HDVs emit SPM, S02, NO,,, VOC and
very little of HC and CO. But old and defective diesel driven vehicles can produce black smoke
(suspended particulate matters containing PAH). White smoke consists of atomized lubricating oil,
produced from mixed lubrication motors, used in motor-cycles and 3-wheel vehicles. The above
mentioned exhaust components have been positively identified poisonous air pollutants which
causes serious adverse impacts to human health and to the environment.

5.2  Effect of air pollutants upon human health.
57.  Normally motor vehicle exhaust emission contain air pollutants like CO, HC, NO., S02 Pb
and SPM. Urban people are the prime victim of these air pollutants and morbidity and mortality are
found enormous in every year, if monitored regularly by the medical institutions. The effects of air
pollutants upon human health is briefly described below:
*     CO (Carbon-dioxide): Motor vehicles contributes major percentage of CO in the air. It is
rapidly absorbed in lungs and by the blood, reducing its oxygen carrying capacity and thus  _
less oxygen gets to heart and brain causing headaches, fatigues and exacerbates
cardiovascular diseases. Large numbers of sensitive people experience adverse health       1
effects at concentration level of 15 ppm (8 hrs. average).
NO. (Nitrogen Oxides): It is mostly emitted during fuel combustion in motor vehicles as nitric
oxides (NO). It can remain for several days In the air and it is oxidised and converted into
nitrogen dioxide (NO2) which is more toxic. It affects human respiratory system and plants
(either as an acid or as an oxidant). It is sensitive to bronchities and bronchial pneumonia
and causes airway resistance in asthamatics and decrease lung function.
*     HC (Hydro-Carbon):  This pollutant is termed as assorted hydrocarbaon to include all
organic compounds emitted both in the exhaust (created by incomplete combustion of fuel)
and by evaporation from the fuel system  and embraces many hundreds of different
compounds. Some are toxic or carcinogenic. The composition of HC emission's is strongly
influenced by the composition of the fuel, So changes in fuel specifications can modify their
effects.                                                                                   -
SO2 (sulphur-dioxide): This pollutant is emitted as exhaust from diesel driven vehicles and
can remain in the air from a few hours to several weeks. The emission rate is directly linked
to the sulphur contained in the fuel. Sulphur is mixed with diesel fuel normally from 0.1 to 1.1
percent by weight. But some developing countries like Brazil, India and Pakistan allow 1.0
percent or even higher amounts of sulphur in diesel oil. Most of the sulphur in the fuel burns
to S02 and emitted to air as diesel exhaust and acts as a significant contributors to ambient
S02 levels in some area. S02 is acidic and soluble in water. It acts as a powerful irritant to
the mucus membranes of the eyes and the upper respiratory tract causing hacking cough,
shortness of breath and spasm of the larynx. Its acidity also attacks plants, aquatic life, and
materials.
Pb (Lead Compounds): Tetra-alkyl lead compounds added to fuel to raise the octane rate
and help lubricate the engine extensively as "anti-knock". Leaded petrol normally contain
0.10 g /I. After combustion volatile lead compounds are formed and expelled in the exhaust
gas. The inorganic lead compounds are emitted as fine particles which can penetrate deep
into the lungs and ultimately into blood and other body tissues. It affects the haematopoietic
system, nervous system, and renal system. In addition, it affects the normal function of
reproductive, endocrine, hepatic, cardio-vascular, immulogic and gastro-intenstinal system.
The most sensitive group of lead poisoning is children, affecting their learning ability,
behaviour and intelligence and anemia. Lead emitted into the air can be breathed in directly
or consumed through drinking water or vegetables.
*     SPM   (Suspended Particulate Matters): This include suspended airborne particles from
diesel fuel, naterials produced by friction, tire wear, heavy metals, and dust. Diesel driven
vehicles emit black smoke which contain carbon nuclei combined with wide range of organic
and other compounds. They have a high staining power and gathers as coating to buildings
and other materials. Health effects of these particles include increased mortality, morbidity,
and irrevocable pulmonary function.  It accelerates respiratory irritation, lung diseases,
thoracic, allergenic, carcinogenic or mutagenic problems and may give rise to discomfort and
annoyance.

5.3 Air quality standards
58.  Air quality standards such as ambient air quality standard and vehicle emission standard may
be expressed in terms of max. allowable concentration level or limit value for vehicle exhaust
emission, protecting human health from air pollution. They are expressed in  .tg/m3 in terms for
concentration level and in g/km in terms for quantities per unit distance. Air quality standards is
used as a legal instrument by the law enforcement authority to take measure against the polluters.
5.3.1  Ambient air quality standard
59.  Air quality 'standard is expressed in terms of maximum allowable concentration level for air
pollutants protecting human health. Ambient air quality Guidelines set levels at which no adverse
health impacts is expected from any component of air pollutants. Standards based on relatively
short averaging periods (1,8, or 24 hours) are better at accounting for peak hours concentrations
than standards based on yearly average values. In developed countries like USA and International
Organization like WHO, standards have been set up for concentration levels for some limited
number of air pollutants like CO, HC, NO., SPM, PM10, 03, PAN, VOC, PAH and lead. The reason
for selecting these compounds is that they are probably the most serious ones in terms of health
damage. US air quality standard is shown in TABLE - 4, and WHO air quality guidelines is shown in
TABLE - 5.

*TSP standard was abandoned in US in 1987 and was replaced  by size fractionated
Particulate Matters (PM).
60.  Current US standards are for size fractionated particulates namely PM  2.5 and PM10. The
numbers 2.5 and 10 refer to effective areodynamic diameter in micro meters. The new standards
were introduced in July, 1997 to incorporate the recent scientific understanding of the effects of PM
,on human health. The current standards are shown in Table -12.

61   PM load being the foremost air pollution problem in Dhaka, all information in this connection
should be made up to date and should correspond to current understanding in the world. The PM2.5
particles, which are produced in high temperature processes, are more hazardous as these
penetrate deep into the lungs and enter blood stream. In fact large fraction of the particulate
(probably to the extent of -90%) produced by motor vehicles fall into PM2.5 category.

65.  Immediate sources of air pollution include domestic fire, motor traffic and industrial works.
Therefore, the ambient quality of air measured over an area has several contributions.
Unfortunately, monitored data on air pollution level collected for a period is not available. In the
absence of data regarding other pollutant sources, even if data is collected in this area, it would be
difficult to ascribe the contribution of traffic to it. However, using mass emission factors, an
approximate scenario has been established.
5.4 Climatic Factors
66. Meteorological conditions play a major role in dispersion, dilution & transportation of air
pollutants. The velocity and direction of wind are critical factors in dispersal and consequent
reduction or increase in the level of air pollutants over an area. More stable the air, greater in the
likely concentration. Data on wind movement patterns is essential for formulating stability factors &
application of Gaussian models.
67. Temperature plays a significant role in creating a larger or smaller mixing volume.
Meteorological data on temperature gradient is necessary at intervals of height above the surface in
Jetermining the mixing height. This enables calculation of the volume of air and the quantify of
)ollutants, which can be extrapolated to provide the level of concentration of various pollutant gases

air quality standards of Bangladesh]
68.  However, the situation is completely reversed if there is atmospheric inversion, which takes
place when the ground temperatures is not high enough to warm the air to rise. No data on intrusion
occurrence is available from the meteorological sources. In highly polluted environments, incursions
can have very significant impact & may cause abnormal rise in pollutant level during winter.
69.  Monsoon plays a significant role in reducing the level of air pollution, as the pollutants are
mixed with water vapours and get precipitated. In highly industrialised nations, they may cause acid
rain. Considering the level of industrialisation in Bangladesh at the moment, monsoon should be
viewed as a pollution mitigating factor.

70   The data available is inadequate to take climatic factors into consideration. Rainfall, humidity
factors & temperature suggest that air pollutant concentration is likely to be comparatively high for
the months between November to February. No data was made available on the direction and
speed of wind or periods of storms & high velocity. Wind direction & speed varies during the day &
built form modifies it considerably. Wind rise with speed and direction is necessary for predicting on
estimating air pollution level, as dispersal is a major factor in reduction of air pollution level.



7 1. Data is not also available regarding the change of temperatures according to height. Usually
air temperature falls by 0.50C to 10 C for every 100 meter gain of height above m.s.l. Observed
temperature gradients provide mixing heights, which determine the volume of air available over an
area in which the emitted pollutants are held. Measurement of the volume of air, vis-a-vis, the
amount of pollutant emitted indicates the concentrations of particular pollutant's level of
concentration per meter cube. These then can be compared with the prescribed ambient air quality
[ref. Table-14]. Since this method ignores several other parameters, the results can only be
indicative. However, in the absence of proper equipments and laboratory facilities for monitoring air
quality regularly, this method using mass emission factors has been used to compute emission      |
levels at different road intersections. These indications and findings can provide guidelines for
policy decisions. [Ref. Tables-18 & 19). The emission factors adopted in Table 18 are based on
rigorous research by Central Road Research Laboratory of India and is considered to be reliable.
Since Bangladesh has not yet introduced control over engine emission factors, the 1991 values of
India, i.e. prior to introduction of emission control measures, has been adopted.                 R

72   Emission factors of different types of engines vary, even within the same mode category.
Averages have been arrived at through several observations. Dependability of the factors, is based
on regimens of testing procedure. However, in the absence of any other alternate dependable
method, mass emission factors are used to estimate approximate level of concentration of various
pollutant gases. It must, however, be remembered that since the mass of gases vary, the
transportation and concentration characteristics also vary, which are not taken into consideration in
the mass emission based calculations, which are used in the absence of adequate micro-climatic
data.
73.  The usefulness of the emission factors are limited to the data base, which indicates the level
of emission made by a particular made in terms of gms. per km travelled. This is suitable for working
out mass of pollutants over a larger network. However, it has been adopted to provide the pollution
level of of all iintersections, where the height of concentration is assumed to be 1Sm on the basis of
surrounding built from form. The following detailed calculation used is for the intersection at Zero
Point [based on 1992 traffic census].

CO = 511,414 gm / km for 16-hr volume.
Assuming peak hour to be twice the average volume, the total CO emission in peak hour would be (511,414116 x 2=
63.927 glkm which comes to 64 gm per metre.
(Assuming that all vehicles have traversed 31 .68 m distance in the junction)
the total emission emitted during peak hour is 31.68 m x31.68 = 2,025 gm
i)     Assuming a dispersion height of 15m:
Tne cubic volume of the junction is  15,055.2 cu.m   (15 x 30.6 x 32.8)
The CO concentration is 2.0251(15.055.2)= 0.1345 gm/cu.m. = 134.522mg/m3 = 134.522  pg/m3
ii)    Assuming a dispersion height of 100 m:
The cubic volume of the junction is  100.036,80 cu.m   (100x 30.6 x 32.8)                                             _
The CO concentration is 2,0251(100.036.80)=  0.02024 gm/cu.m. = 20.24 mg/r3 = 20,242.71 pg/r3'
74.  On the basis of this, emissions at 25 intersections including the proposed 3 fly-over sites have
been computed based on 1993 traffic volume as compared to projected figures for 1997 traffic
volume and with assumed dispersion heights of 15m and 100m. The changes in emission levels
iave been calculated for individual pollutants.

re presented successively in Appendix B and C.)

NB - All the values of emission per cu.m is very much on the higher side because:
(a)   no factor of wind movement or dispersal has been taken into account. There would be a
factor depending on speed & direction of the wind & surrounding landuse.
(b)   the lowest value of dispersion height (15m) has been taken, resulting in smaller mixing
volume.
(c)   peak hour volume is arbitrarily taken at twice the average volume.
(d)   the volurne of pollutants is worked out at junction where the volume is the highest.
However the value of the exercise is in its ability to compare relative changes.

(d)   the volume of pollutants is worked out at junction where the volume is the highest.
7. The computed values in Table 23(A) and 23(B) seems to be highly exaggerated which may be
:aused by, among other factors, very simple approximations made for a very complex system. In
-der to make these calculations more realistic, attempts are made to normalize these calculated
alues to median observed values as per Table-24.
7.  These normalizing factors have been observed to be different for each component of the
llutants as each pollutant interacts differently with the atmosphere.
The normalised emission levels are presented  in Table-25(A)  and Table-25(B) and
tic:pated change in emission levels are presented in Table-26.

"?  The foregoing calculations were made on the assumption that NMT can be ignored in pollution
*;Wcu!ation. But in reality this is not correct If MT and NMT are allowed to interact. Currently more
ihan 60% of the roadway is occupied by NMT with a maximum vehicular speed of less than 1OkmIh.
It NMT is removed, the carrying capacity of the road can be doubled, which will result in increased
vehicular speed and eventually a decrease in pollution levels.
80. This interaction between MT and NMT has not been considered in the present computations
3lthough it is very crucial and needs further attention,

These consumption values can be extrapolated with the emission factors (ref. Table
no  to assess the emission volume of different parameters.
l  Alternately, the emission factors for vehicle and engine type, i.e., petrol or diesel, based on
e amount of fuel consumed Jref.: Table-1 2 Emission factors based on consumption of fuel]. The
te of consumption of fuel, per vehicle type has been provided in DUTP I, Working Paper V. [ ref. -
3]. The reduction in congestion & increase in travel speed can be computed to estimate the
Xduction in mass emission level, which them can be translated into tangible benefits.
2. Therefore. emission level can be estimated by the following formula:
= Z   N, Uti Efi,        where         N = number of vehicle,
Ef= emission factor
Ut= Rate of Utilization
i= vehicle type
P = pollutant type.

5.6 Traffic volume
83.  The data of detailed traffic volume mode wise is available only for 1992 when a detailed traffic
census was conducted. The current volume & projected volume of traffic, mode wise, on the links to
all the intersections has been arrived at. The level of pollution in the junction & the links has been
estimated. The relative difference between values indicate the levels of benefits or disbenefits.
84.  The most important factor that emerges is that given the present emission factors, rise in
volume of traffic is directly proportional to the level of pollution. Therefore, emission control and
progressive reduction is sine qua non. Similarly, improvement in fuel quality, i.e. low sulphur, & lead
free fuel would have considerable impact on the air pollution scenario.                         j
85.  Alternately, the emission factors for vehicle and engine type, i.e. petrol or diesel, based on the
amount of fuel consumed (Table 6: Emission Factors Based on Consumption of Fuel) can be used.
The reduction in congestion and increase in travel speed can be computed to estimate the reduction
in mass emission level, which then can be translated into tangible benefits.

6. Noise Pollution
86. A noise is commonly defined as being any unwelcome sound. This definition has been
broadened to indicate that sound is considered a noise if the person concerned feels that it
interferes or conflicts with his activities.
87.  Problems caused by noise are becoming more severe both in modern industrialised countries
as well as in the developing countries. Noise can cause loss of hearing, or it can annoy and
disturb people's various activities which require greater concentration of mind. The other ill-effects
include fatigue, loss of sleep, mental stress, increase of heart diseases, blood pressure, diminishing
capability of hearing and communication etc.
88.  That is why permitted levels of sound varies depending on the land use and activity pattern.
The disturbance evoked by noise depends on various factors, most important are the following:
I) The intensity of the sound or noise level
ii) The duration of separate impulses
iii) The frequency of sound impulses
iv) The subjective reaction to noise or individual sensitivity

6.1 Traffic Noise:
89. Noise is notified as pollutant under the Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act. 1997. Out
of many other sources of noise pollution, the road traffic noise has been recognized as a single very
significant pollutant for urban community environment. Traffic noise is influenced by the following
factors:
a)           Noise from engines, exhaust pipes and electric and
Hydraulic horns
b)           Density of traffic flow
c)           Vehicle speed and rolling noise of tyres in contact with      the road
surfaces
d)           Road surface characteristics and road gradients
90. Traffic noise constitutes a linear source, rather than a point source, radiating noise in a sphere
and representing more of a cylindrical form. Traffic thus creates two zones of noise:
i) Inner Zone
ii) Outer Zone
91.  Denser the traffic, narrower is the inner zone. If the volume and composition is the same, the
noise level of the inner zone can be calculated as 20 log (PCU/h) and outer zone by 10 log(PCU/hr).
Since the composition of traffic is unlikely to be uniform, it is desirable to measure the noise level,
and relate them to traffic volume.

By June 1998, the traffic volume has increased considerably. As such, assuming a 3% increase in volume,
Noise Level = 20 log PCU/h       20 log 4651         = 73.35
Observed Noise Level      =      82 dBA (as on 22/06/98)
92.  Therefore, the resulting model may be considered as a rough guide for estimating noise
level. However, empirical testing is essential to validate or modify the model, to account for local
conditions. Non-motorised traffic volume may not be taken into consideration.
93.  The existing status of noise pollution in the project area is worse. This may be perceived at
every intersections and bus terminals of Dhaka City. During traffic congestion, the terrible noise
produced from the old engines of the buses and trucks combined with the high pitched sound of air
and hydraulic horns make the noise level more than the standard limits and thus thousands of
peoples around those intersections and roads are adversely affected by such noise pollution.



DUTP II Draft Final Report: Appendix - K Environmental Action Plan           Page 41 of 75
g      Particularly, partial loss of hearing of bus and truck drivers may be attributed to the effect of
constant or repeated exposure to higher levels of noise of their vehicles. In addition to that, this has
_       adverse effect on roadside residents and traffic police on duty. But the magnitude and overall effect
of noise pollution over these groups of people is not yet monitored for Dhaka urban area.
x       6.2  Noise Standards
94.  Weighted noise level is used to express the subjective loudness. This is a measure of the
overall intensity after the lowest and the extreme top notes have been filtered out. Three kinds of
weightage are used, giving readings in dBA, dBB and dBC scales. The most commonly used is the
dBa curve, which gives measured values for the weighted noise level that are nearly proportional to
the subjective impression of loudness. The perceived noise level (PNL) is used as a measure of the
disturbance produced by noise from a single source, and is defined by a niandatory comparison
411     with a standard source.
95.  Normally 50 dBA is Considered as standard values for noise pollution by the international
experts e.g. WHO experts. But according to the Environment and Transport Departments, France
(?) Ministry, noise level 'Leq' (8.00 hours-20.00 hour) of 65 dBA should not be exceeded for urban
zones and 60 dBA for rural zones.
96.  But with the rapid development of communication system in the urban areas of Bangladesh,
the traffic load has been increasing day by day. Thus the road noise level is increasing every year.
To control the ever growing problem  of noise pollution in Bangladesh, the Department of
Environment (DOE) Bangladesh has promulgated an Ambient Noise Standard Level and Noise
Emission level for vehicles in 1995. These are presented in Table - 31 and Table - 32
6.3  Noise Level Measurement of Dhaka City
97.  Measurement of noise level was conducted by the DOE, Bangladesh at 20 different points
particularly at Schools and Hospitals during the period from  3r' March to 7ih April/1 997 both at 9.00
a.m. to 10-30  a.m. in the morning and 3.00 to 4.00 p.m. in the evening arid recorded noise level
56 d8A to 79 dBA in the morning and 68 dBA to 84 dBA in the evening time, against standard level
45 dBA for these sensitive areas.
6.4 Noise Level Measurement in DUTP-11 Project Area
98.  Ambient Noise Levels have been monitored at 20 locations at intersectiot1s and 3 locations at
proposed Fly-over sites and shown in Table-30.
99.  It has been observed that the average ambient noise levels at these locations exceed the
standards during day time. Vehicular noise is the major source of noise pollution in all the
intersection areas where observations were made.
100. For DUTP II, Noise Levels were studied by recording the noise values at the intersections
during busy hours (morning and afternoon peak hours) with the help of a noise meter. Precision
Integrating Sound Level Meter Type 2218 by Beuel & Kjaer of Denmark was extensively used for
these observations.

. .. vciy narmful or annoying effect of noise is basically a question of its level, duration and
frequency content. These three factors are combined in the concept of Equivalent Continuous
Sound Levels (L,).
6.5 Equivalent Level of Sustained Noise (Leq.):
The Leq values were calculated using the following formula:
Leq         Leq(D) - 10 log T + 27 778
where T       = duration of observation ( displayed elapsed time in hours,
correct to 3 decimal places.
Leq(D)            displayed noise value.

Note: When sound level is measured, motor vehicle is stationary and engine conditions are as follows:
i)     Diesel engine - max. rotating speed
ii)    Petrol engine - %1. of max. rotating speed.
iii)   Motor cycle -1/2 rpm 5000 & 3/ for less than 5000 rpm.
102'.' However, it is necessary to record noise level regularly, so that the legal requirement of noise,
level is respected [ ref. Table-31 : Ambient Noise standards] measurement of noise produced by
traffic depends on the frequency of traffic. To arrive at logical expression of street noise, it is
necessary to combine loudness of noise with its frequency of occurrence. Following methods are
used.
(i)    summated frequency of occurrence.
(ii)    Equivalent level of sustained noise
(iii)    Traffic noise index



Page 44 of 75
U.0 oummated Frequency of Occurrence:
103. Noise level during a given period (1 hr. 8 hr. etc.) is recorded at short intervals, preferably
continuously. The number of times the sound level exceeded a particular level is noted. The
summated frequency of occurrence, i.e. the percentage of al occurrences, which exceed a particular
noise level. Produces an Index. For example, L50 = 60 dBA, meahs that 50% of all measurements
exceeded 60 dBA. Similarly 11 = 60 dBA would mean that 1% of all measurements exceeded the
level of 60 level of 60 dBA. L50 represents the mean noise level, and Ll express mean level of peak
noises.
Equivalent level of sustained noise level = L e. Le values can be calculated by the following
formula: Le = 10 log { I E   100 1 iitt}
Where       T = duration of observation
ti = length of time the noise reached Li during observation period.
'By this method the fluctuating noise can be converted into a steady sound of equivalent
energy content.
Relationship between lo and traffic density can be expressed as:
le (m) = 30 + 10 log N. where m = distance of observer from source and
N = number of PCU h-1.
Traffic Noise Index (TNI) is calculated over a period of 24 hours. L10 & L90 are measured
every hour, & afterwards the 24 measurements are averaged.
TNI = 4 (4L10 - L90) + L90 - 30.
104. However, these calculations of noise level may indicate approximate levels. Since these are
based on European conditions, where traffic is reasonably homogeneous, and use of horn is raise,
the sudden peaks of noise experienced in the sub-continent, cannot be taken into account.
6.7 Other factors
105. Noise, in addition to the volume of traffic depends on the following factors:
106. (i) Road surface, (ii) speed of traffic, (iii) composition of traffic, proportion of heavy, (iv)
gradients & intersections, (v) obstructs passage of sound, (vi) Vegetation, (vii) meteorological
factors, (viii) reflection from other buildings.
107. All these factors are locations specific & needs careful measurement. In this project, two
flyovers have been proposed. Since these are elevated structures, the dispersal of sound & impact
of sound may affect larger area & annoy people. These can be understood by supplying the outer
core model of noise & using climatic factors for dispersal. Mitigating measures, need to be carefully
considered.
108. The central reservations of corridors are to be widened to 2m, to accommodate thick hedge &
trees. These may have considerable impact on the noise level, abate air pollution and improve the
aesthetics of street since. Design options are be evaluated to achieve these objectives.

7. Environmental Imapct Evaluation
7.1 Environmental Impact value matrix
109. The EE is used to evaluate the expected future condition of environmental quality, both 'with'
and 'without' the project. The difference in Environmental Impact values (EIV) between these two
conditions constitutes either an adverse impact, which corresponds to the loss of EIV, or a beneficial
impact with corresponding gain of values.
Mathematically, this process may be represented as follows:
III             I??
El = I      (V)1 wI -  ;     (V)2 w
Where:
El = environmental impact
(v,) = Value of environmental quality of parameter i ' with' the project
(Vi) 2 = Value of environmental quality of parameter i 'without' the project
wi = relative weight (Importance) of parameter i
m = total number of parameters.
110. The process involves preparation of scaling and weighing checklist. It provides description of
the environmental parameters that are included in the checklist and instructions for their relative
scaling with respect to these parameters and for assignment of important units.
111. Due to paucity of data and constraints of time it was proposed to create a composite matrix
which covers the most essential parameters, both for establishing base line as well as assessing
impact. This assessment has four stages (i) establishing base line for existing environmental quality,
(ii) evaluation of proposed design of intersection improvement & fly overs, (iii) impact during
construction period, and (iv) post construction impacts & mitigating measures. The impact values
are subjective based on value judgement, in a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the least & 5 is the
maximum.
112. Annexure D contains two nos. of Environmental Impact Evaluation Matrices. The first matrix is
for the present scenario i.e. 'without proiect' and the second one is for 'with project' scenario when
project interventions take place.

7.2' Interpretation of environmental impact values (EIV)
113.  Following ascribing environmental impact values to all parameters, baseline impact values
have been meticulously determined. Assessment of Impact due to proposed improvements has
been made & compared against base line values.
114. The quantitative index of change are evident from the resulting Table-33. The distribution of
impact values to each parameter cumulatively indicates the state of the environment.
'i15. Out of the 25 locations, only a small proportion (5 nos.) show a remarkably high gain of EIV
(+20 and above) and the majority of locations (17 nos.) indicate a moderate gain of EIVs (from +11
upto +20). The remaining 3 locations show very poor gain of EIVs (upto +10).
116. Positive high values justifiy the project intervention. Moderate values indicates moderate gains
from the project and the poor values indicate increased need for mitigating measures. Since no
negative value was encountered, indications are that there is no adverse impact by the project.
117. The cumulative gain in value, from 1891 to 2307, i.e. a gain of +416 ( about 21 %), is an
indication of an appreciable quantitative index of positive impact predicted to be achieved by the
project interventions in its entirety.

8. Network Model
118. DUTP II consultancy included a task to prepare a traffic network model for Dhaka using data
obtained in the 1992 DITS study and updated where possible from recent traffic surveys. This
model was used to estimate traffic volumes and speeds on links of the network representing the
major roads in Greater Dhaka. Trips were assigned to the network in the following categories:
Non-motorised vehicles that for this analysis of air pollution can be ignored. (Although the
interaction between motorized and NMT is very important and this interaction has not been
considered in pollution calculations.)
Public transport trips that involve diesel buses and 3-wheeler 2-stroke tempos;
Other motor vehicle trips that involve passenger cars and 3-wheeler 2-stroke auto-rickshaws;
and
Trucks that are assumed to be diesel powered.
119. Vehicle emissions are related to the quantity of fuel consumed, -which in turn is a
consequence  of vehicle condition, traffic congestion, driving behaviour and  environmental
conditions. In general terms, vehicles consume more fuel per unit of travel distance at very low
speeds or very high speeds than at moderate speeds. Stop-start travel conditions, typical of
congested roads, will also increase fuel consumption per unit of travel distance compared with
smooth traffic flow. Poorly maintained vehicles will have higher fuel consumption and significantly
worse emissions of pollutants than well maintained vehicles.
120. Any strategy designed to tackle air pollution from motor vehicles will need to be multi-faceted
(vehicle condition, traffic congestion, driver behaviour etc.) but priorities also need to be established
so that limited resources are used to best effect. As a contribution to the setting of priorities, the
DUTP network model was used as basis for estimating the likely impact of different air pollution
strategies.

to the lack of local data, information from India was used to estimate the pollution load
ilting from vehicle use in greater Dhaka under various scenarios. Fuel consumption
s by speed of travel for three vehicle types (2-stroke petrol engines, 4-stroke petrol
ines and diesel engines) are shown in Figure 1: Fuel consumption rates.

ssumptions made in these projections include:
emission control exists in the base year 1992;
ne average km per year per vehicle is calculated based on engine efficiencies and fuel
-nsumption amounts by class of vehicle;-
.uto diesel and petrol contain 0.8 percent sulphur and 0.45 grams/litre lead respectively;
%nnual growth rates for motor cars is 20 percent,
Annual growth rates for mini buses is 10 percent; and 1.6 percent for big buses,
Annual growth rates for motor cycles is 6 percent:
Annual growth rates for auto-rickshaws is 20 percent.
'. Estimates of vehicle flows and speeds on links (representing road sections) for the base case
DUTP  investment) and  the  project case  (after DUTP  investment) were used  to compute
lutant loads for the greater Dhaka area. Traffic flows and speeds from the network model are
ak hour estimates. Pollutant loads are probably lower in periods outside peak hours but for this
,alysis the relationship between peak hour and all-day is assumed to be constant.
'3. As well as the effect of implementing road infrastructure, the likely impacts of management
rategies were also assessed. These strategies included:
Better enforcement of vehicle condition regulations such that fuel consurnption and emission
levels would reduce; and
Achieving modal shifts from smaller vehicles to larger vehicles i.e. from 3-wheelers and
passenger cars to buses.
~esults of this analysis are summarised in Table-24.

worK is that measures to improve vehicle condition are
Irt y to be more significant than traffic management improvements or modal shifts. Within a
v,hicle condition" strategy, the major emphasis should be on improving the performance (in
pollution terms) of 3-wheeler 2-stroke vehicles. Several measures could be considered such as:
* Encouraging the use of higher quality oils;
* Banning the use of 2-stroke engines for new vehicles; or
* Restricting 2-stroke powered vehicles to local trips as feeder services to bus routes.
125. Air pollution is not the only environmental issue associated with transport infrastructure
development. The study reveals that in some locations, open spaces are affected (positively or
negatively) and this is weighted against the expected transport benefits. Extreme care has been
taken to minimize the negative impact on biological environment. In making proposals for
improvement in road intersection geometry and design, minimum number of the existing trees have
been have been marked to be removed. As regards smaller plants on the road sides, re-siting will
be done without destroying it.
* The net effects of DUTP on pollution levels are shown in Table-35 (Chapter-8). It was expected
that the primary results of such a model would be the increments in the average traffic speed
along the network. When these numbers are coupled to the model for speed dependence of fuel
consumption for vehicles, data in Table-35 result.
*  The fuel saving of 10% shown in Table-35 appears as an adhoc approximation rather than an
output of the network model calculation. A complex mocdel is highly unlikely to yieid such a round
number. The model appears to provide the perceived impact of 10% fuel saving on pollution
level.
*  Only marginal improvements are shown in most cases but marginally negative impacts are
shown in the case of mode shift of trips. In view of the uncertainties in the model input data, the
uncertainties in the results could be quite high.
8.1  Alternative model:
126. Increment of average speeds is considered to be helpful in the DUTP impact evaluation both
in terms of traffic management and pollution levels. In order to make DUTP worthwhile,
achievement of an increment in vehicular speed of 10 km/h may be attempted. A simple model
showing considerable fuel saving due to reduced transit and idling time would translate to lesser
pollution loads. Such a model is described in Table-25.
Table 36: A simple model for fuel saving calculation as a result of increased mean
speed of vehicles
Assumption: Vehicles either move at constant speed or they are at stand still.
The speed of a vehicle can be expresses as
S = Sf ( 1 - F(t)
/here
S = Speed of a vehicle
Sf = Free flow speed of vehicle if there is no congestion
F,,, =T,,,! T = Idling time,Transit lime



It    DUTP 11 Drafl Final Report: Appendix - K Environmental Action Plan              Page 52 of 75
127. Sf of 50km/hr. or higher can be achieved on Airport road or city roads after 10 pm. Currently
-     reported value for S in Dhaka is 25km/hr. As a result of DUTP-11 project interventions,  it is
I     anticipated to increase to 35 km/hr. (Key assumption : DUTP is not worthwhile if it can not achieve
an increment in speed of more than 10km/hr.).

Fuel consumption can be written as:  C= Cf ( 1+0.7 F(t))
1     C= Actual fuel consumed, Cf= Fuel consumed for free flow.
I     128. The rather high value of 0.7 as the coefficient for F(,) partially corrects for the initial simple
assumption of constant speed or stand still motion.
I     129. Real motion consists of transit at variable speed with higher fuel consumption per km at lower
speed.

130. Thus, it appears that considerable fuel saving could be achieved even with moderate
increment in speed and this would result in substantial reduction in pollution levels.
9. Environmental Action Plan
131. An environmental action plan (EAP) for DUTP should address a number of issues that relate
to environmental quality in Dhaka. Recommendations for action are summarised on the following
sections:                                                                                        p
9.1  Air Pollution:                                                                             I
1 32. This is a high priority concern as it is seriously affecting quality of life in the city and represents
a major public health issue. Improvements in the levels of pollution from mobile sources are not
likely to flow from DUTP investments for some years. Hence, a strong commitment to enforcement  p
of vehicle condition regulations is needed urgently.
9.1.1  Recommended Actions:                                                                      L
Institutional
1.    Formation of Air Pollution Advisory Committee of Stakeholders. MOEF Ministry will finalize
the Action Plan with assistance from the proposed Advisory Committee.
2.    Establish capability for vehicular safety and emissions related research and long-term
planning through formation of Air Pollution Research Consortium of Academic Laboratories
and Scientific Establishments
Transportation Planning Measures
1.    Promoting and funding mass transit through fuel taxes.
2.    Improved traffic planning, engineering & enforcement of traffic laws.
3.    Progressive reduction of polluting vehicles over time through taxation and other fiscal
incentives
4.    Introduction of auto-Rickshaw  fare meters to make  cycle -Rickshaws increasingly
uneconomical for distances greater than 3 km.
5.    Road designs should be mandatory to cater for medians and other unpaved areas for
planting trees and leafy shrubs. Vegetation filters some dust and particulate matter created
by road use.
Regulations & Enforcement Measures



DUTP*14 Draft Final Report: Appendix - K Environmental Action Plan               Page 54 of 75
1.    Establish a reliable system for monitoring vehicle condition and quality of the exhaust gases.
2.    Provide fixed and mobile automotive emissions enforcement equipment for monitoring
vehicle emission levels.
3.    Set up a mobile enforcement group to test vehicles and issue notices requiring owners to
maintain and repair defective vehicles. Acquire vehicle emission inspection monitoring
equipment required for strict enforcement.
4.    Promote better vehicle maintenance by introducing comprehensive fitness certificates.
Inspection and maintenance pollution checks are determined to be an effective way of
increasing public awareness of the air pollution problem in Dhaka. It also provides a simple
means for the law enforcement agency to determine if a vehicle has satisfactorily passed the
smog test. Utmost care has to be exercised to ensure the genuineness and validity of the
certificates.
5.    Introduce a program to phase out the use of 2-stroke engines in road vehicles.
6.    Promotion of high performance semi-synthetic lubricating oil and premix standards for the
two stroke engine vehicles and ways to reduce emissions.
7.    Implement a lubricating oil Pilot Project for 3-wheelers.
8.    Make oil companies responsible for quality of their products delivered to their customers.
9.    Demonstrate pumpless lubricating systems for the three wheelers.
10.   Demonstrate alternatives to use in two-stroke three wheelers (upgrade       kits, CNG,
Policy alternatives etc.)
11.   Assess requirement of four-stroke engines for the new three-wheelers through progressive
emission standards.
12.   Evaluate alternatives to reduce diesel vehicle emissions (inspection and maintenance,
replacement, enforcement, CNG buses, traps, policy incentives, etc.)
Public Awareness & Training
1.    Initiate awareness raising campaigns for the drivers through media campaigns, drivers'
training, involvement of teachers and school children through arts and dramatic
performances.
2.    Introduce public information campaign to alert the people to the seriousness of air pollution
problem in Dhaka. Increased public awareness on health concerns is needed to justify
regulations that must be taken to clean up the air.
3.    Provide training for vehicle owners, drivers and mechanics. Educating the auto-rickshaw
drivers as well as bus and truck owners and drivers is very important. The auto-rickshaw
drivers and owners shall be required to use quality fuels, semi-synthetic lubricating oil
premix, avoid use of loose lubricating oil and buying fuei from unauthorised street vendors.
Training camps to be organised to demonstrate clean vehicle technology, quality fuels and
importance of regular servicing and proper maintenance.

Ensure Effectiveness of Control Programs Through Air Monitoring
1.    Implement quality assured monitoring program through equipment & training.
2.    Develop knowledge base which can absorb and contribute information independently.
3.    Open analysis and reporting of air pollution data.                                         |
4.    Use of monitoring data for mid-course corrections of action plan.
5.    Provide modern DOE facilities needed for quality assurance for offices, air monitoring
equipment and laboratories.
6.    Capacity building with additional dDe manpower, training programs and technical exchanges.
Assessment Requirements
1.    Compile a GIS-based emissions inventory of pollution sources by category and type of
pollutant.
2.    Studies on impact of air pollution on human health in different professional groups vulnerable
to air pollution.                                                                         I

9.2 Noise Pollution:
133. Many locations in Dhaka experience unacceptably high noise levels due in large part to road
traffic. A significant proportion of this noise level is due to aggressive and unnecessary use of
vehicle horns - a practice that appears to serve little purpose other than to demand unreasonable
use of the roadway.
9.2.1  Recommended Actions
1.        Establish a reliable system for monitoring noise levels at all important locations.
2.        Introduce a program to create awareness in the general public on the long-term impacts
of high noise levels on people's health.
3.        Develop training programs for drivers specifically geared towards encouraging less
aggressive driving practices and reduced need for unwanted traffic noise and rampant
use of high pitched horns.
4.        Creating noise barriers at important locations/sites.
5.        Plantation of trees and shrubs as these have some practical effect as well as a
psychological benefit in reducing perceived nuisance of traffic noise.
6.        Adopt appropriate legislation and regulatory measures to impose stricter controls on
residential building construction near major road intersections,  limiting speed near
especially sensitive areas like schools and hospitals, enforcing by-pass routes for the
noisiest vehicles, such as trucks at night.
9.3 Water Pollution:
134. Dhaka's water bodies are important to the quality of life of many of its residents. These areas
are breathing spaces for the city as well as a source of fish and water for various purposes.
However, road surfaces drain into these water bodies through a network of secondary and tertiary
drains which carry large concentrations of dissipated motor oils and other forms of toxic pollution.
9.3.1 Recommended Actions:
1.    Initiate a campaign to ban the repair and washing of vehicles on public roads.
2.    Provision of adequate dustbins and efficient means of garbage disposal without spilling onto
the road-side drains.
3.    Provision of adequate, well-maintained and functional public toilets on all important roads
and intersections for road users which are located near parks, lakes and water bodies.
4.   . Legislation and regulation measures should be considered with the definition of protection
perimeters, retention ponds, constructions in floodable zones, and discharge capable of
changing the quality of surface or ground water.



r .-,-',*-cuix - r tnvironmental Action Plan                   Page 57 of 75
9.4 Soil Pollution:
135. Soil contamination rises from daily traffic operation on very busy road intersections. Metals
such as chromium. D, and zinc remain in the soil for hundreds of years. Soil contamination in Dhaka  r
.mostly comes from uncontrolled spillage of lubricant wastes dispensed by roadside parked vehicles
and unauthorised workshops.
9.4.1 Recommended Actions:
1     Regulate roadside workshops.
2.    Provide used motor oil recovery system.                                                     |
3.    Prompt replanting and plant maintenance.
4.    Controlling the speed and volume of water flows.                                            P
5.    Concrete dissipitation structures designed to slow down fast-running stormwater in drains,
and hence reduce downstream erosion.
6.    Settlement basins to allow silt, pollutants and road rubbish to settle out of runoff water before
it flows into downstream watercourses.
7.    Legislation dealing with soil conservation should be considered. including limits on land use
along the road and requirements for erosion control, especially for roads susceptible to
flooding.
9.5  Biological Environment:
136. Road side projects have significant effects on natural plant, animal and aquatic life or more
explicitly, on flora and fauna. These effects, when they occur, have very distinct effect on the
ecosystem.
137. Consumption of natural space by physical road right of way, disturbance of surface water flow,
erosion, modifications in biodiversity, cutting of trees of economic importance etc. are the prime
concerns for protection of biological environment.
9.5.1 Recommended Actions:
1.    Road development and improvement works would attempt to avoid areas sensitive to
environments in order to avoid severe adverse impacts on flora and fauna.
2.    Stop indiscriminate felling of trees without considering the related environmental issues.
3.    Stop indiscriminate use of open spaces for residential or institutional purposes. Existing
pattern should not be altered without considering the environmental impact thereof.
T.    Road cross sections to be adjusted to reduce impact on adjacent natural environments such
as open spaces and parks.



DUTP 11 Draft Final Report: Appendix - K Environmental Action Plan           Page 58 of 75
5.    Adequate and systematic planting of road reserves and adjacent areas to support existing
flora and fauna.
9.6 Socio-cultural Environment:
138. Road improvement projects can have varying consequences on socio-cultural environment
such as: physical damage caused to related sites, aesthetic impacts on cultural sites, positive
impacts of improved access to sites recognized for their cultural value.
9.6.1 Recommended Actions:
1.    Dismantling of all unauthorised structures within immediate vicinity.
2.    Provide adequate public toilets in the neighborhood of places of heritage and cultural value
such as museums, monuments, architectural sites, etc.
3.    Provide functional dustbins for disposal of garbage/ litters made by the visitors.
4.    Stop indiscriminate felling of trees within the sites of historical and cultural importance on the
plea of extension and development works.
9.7 Health Environment:
139. Blockage of road side drains and poor maintenance measures pose a great threat to human
health for the road side users and the general public. Roadside drains are amply blocked by
household garbage and polythene / plastic shopping bags. In the design of road intersections
considerations should be made for increased accessibility and functional layout for the drains to be
cleaned and wastes disposed off. The absence of adequate number of functional toilets also cause
health hazard due to defecation of road sides, footpaths, drains and open spaces by human and
animal excreta.
9.7.1 Recommended Actions:
1.    Dismantling of all unauthorised wastewater and sewer connections from nearby dwellings to
the road side drains.
2.    Provide adequate and functional public toilets in the neighborhood as well as at all road
intersections, bus terminals and open parks and other places of public gathering.
3.    Stop indiscriminate use of road corners and footpaths for use as open latrines.
4.    Stop indiscriminate use of parks, open spaces etc. for public meetings, gatherings where
littering takes place and no authority / arrangement is there to remove/dispose of it.
9.8 Garbage/Waste Pollution:
140. Inadequate garbage disposal measures pollute the environment and pose a great threat to
human health for the road side users as well as the general public. Prior demand survey and
appropriate location of garbage bins in the design of road intersections are very important.
Considerations should be made for increased accessibility and functional layout for the garbage
disposal vehicles to operate unhindered by traffic flow. Public awareness has to be created against
throwing kitchen wastes I household garbage on the roadsides, footpaths and drains.

9.8.1 Recommended Actions:
1.     Provide adequate and functional dustbins I garbage collection points in the neighborhood as
well as at all road intersections, bus terminals, markets, restaurants and hotels as well as
open parks and other places of public gathering.
2.     Provide functional and an efficient garbage disposal system  with proper and adequate
equipment, vehicles and trained manpower.
3.     Stop indiscrimninate use of road corners and footpaths for garbage disposal.
4.     Stop indiscriminate use of open spaces for public gatherings where littering takes place and
nobody is to remove it.

f.   ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT OF FOOTPATH IMPROVEMENT SITES
Pedestrian of Dhaka City is deprived from foot-path facilities since past and they had to walk along the two sides of road with great risk of accidents. This pattern of
pedestrian traffic flow constricts the main roads causing interruption of vehicular traffic flow and traffic delay. To reduce the above traffic problems, development of
foot-path has been given priority under the road development ad traffic engineering management program. Under this DUTP-11. 10 (ten) road sections, for foot-path
improvement have been taken up for detailed engineering and implementation as follows
(i)       Atish Depankar Road/ Bishwa Road
(ii)      Zoo Road, Mirpur
(iii)     Mazar Road, Mirpur
(iv)    Elephant Road
(V)    Sayedabad Road
(vi)   Rampura Road
(vii)   Shahid Bashar Road, Cantonment Area, Banani
