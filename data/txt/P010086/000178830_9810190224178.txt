INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN FOR THE
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equivalent
of US$30 million on standard IDA terms to help finance the foreign exchange
requirements of the National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC). The
proceeds of the Credit would be relent to NDFC at an interest rate of 8-1/2%
with repayment over approximately 18 years including three years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report "Current Economic Situation and
Issues in Pakistan" (658-PAK, dated March 28, 1975) was distributed to
Executive Directors on April 11, 1975. A country data sheet is attached
as Annex I.
3.        The economy of Pakistan (then West Pakistan) expanded at an
average annual rate of more than 6% during the decade of the 1960's. In
the Second Plan period (1960-65) this growth was spearheaded by industrial
growth of 13% per annum. During the Third Plan (1965-70) agricultural out-
put grew at 5.6% annually with the aid of new high-yielding wheat and rice
varieties, compared with less than 4% in the first half of the decade, but
the industrial growth rate fell to 7.6%. During the 1970's, however, the
growth rate has been considerably lower. During fiscal year 1970/71 and
1971/72, there was virtually no change in total output as political un-
certainties and the conflicts culminating in the separation of the former
East Pakistan resulted in a decline in industrial activity, while drought
virtually halted agricultural growth. Since the return of civilian rule
in late December, 1971, growth has been fairly modest. After two years
without growth, the GNP grew by 7% in 1972/73, but the increase declined to
5% in 1973/74 and this fiscal year it will probably be less than 3.5%. The
industrial expansion was the result primarily of fuller utilization of capa-
city.
4.        In the past year, Pakistan has suffered a series of setbacks.
These have included much larger than anticipated wheat import requirements,
a deterioration of about 20% in its terms of trade and damage during the
trial filling of Tarbela dam that will delay the availability of its water
for irrigation by one year (until about December 1975) and for power genera-
tion by 7 or 8 months (to October-November 1976). However, there have also
been important positive developments, including an acceleration of public
sector investment, some upturn in large-scale private investment, growing
economic ties with, and aid flows from, the Middle East oil-producing
countries, the reopening of transport, postal and limited trade ties with
India, and prospects for a slowdown in world and domestic inflation.



5.        In 1974/75 the output of the major agricultural crops may decline
by 3% or more owing to lack of water. River flows during the 1974 summer
crop season were the lowest in the past 90 years and fall and early winter
canal supplies were only 40% to 50% of normal. Agricultural prospects for
1975/76 depend heavily upon ample canal water this spring and summer and
adequate rains next fall. To encourage agricultural production in the longer
run, farm prices must be adjusted so that farmers receive higher (closer to
world market) prices for their cotton, wheat, rice and other products. The
government has recently lowered export duties and announced higher procure-
ment prices and higher prices to consumers, but further changes in this
direction are needed to rationalize the price structure. Other requirements
for rapid agricultural growth are more adequate programs to make use of
Tarbela Dam water, to increase tubewell water supplies, reduce water-logging
and salinity, improve seeds and cultural practices, and provide more power
to pump water and cultivate fields. With the increasing desire of small
and medium-scale farmers to participate in the "green revolution", agri-
cultural growth in the next five years could at least equal the 5.6% annual
rate of the 1965-70 Third Plan period if appropriate government pricing and
othter policies and programs are followed. When water from Tarbela Dam
becomes available, probably at the end of 1975, this will substantially
increase the area cultivated.
6.        Public and private domestic savings rates have declined steadily
since 1969/70. The chronic problem of public sector resource mobilization
is, together with private resource mobilization, the most important economic
issue facing Pakistan today. Action is needed on three fronts: (a) to
increase revenues through additional taxation and more efficient tax col-
lection and administration; (b) to reduce subsidies and restrain other non-
developmental expenditures and (c) to increase revenues from Government
enterprises through higher prices and increased efficiency.
7.        The 1974/75 consolidated federal and provincial budget projected
a 27% increase in total expenditures and a 37% increase in development ex-
penditures. The growth of current revenues was expected to be at the much
lower rate of 15%, however, partly due to reductions in export duty and
income tax rates. Both domestic and foreign borrowing were to rise substan-
tially in order to cover the larger gap between current revenues and total
expenditures. Ilowever, declining world market prices for cotton, yarn and
textiles and increased wheat imports have resulted in a further reduction
in revenues from export and excise duties (Rs 1,300 million) and increased
expenditure on wheat subsidies (Rs 1,300 million). The resulting increase
in financial requirements has been nearly matched by additional counterpart
receipts from new cash loans and grants (Rs 2,475 million). Another Rs 1,000
million of additional revenues partly from new tax increases and higher
Government utility charges and partly from higher than anticipated revenues
from other taxes will offset other expenditure increases and thus hold the
budget deficit to approximately its original level.



- 3 -
8.        After more than a decade during which prices rarely rose more than
2-3Z annually, Pakistan has been experiencing price increases of 20% to 30%
annually since early 1972. Since mid-1973 the growth of the money supply has
been limited to about 14% annually by various measures of monetary and fiscal
restraint. At the same time (late 1973) that these restraints began to curb
doeestic demand-pull inflation, however, international market price increases
becama much more Important. The dollar prices of imports rose by 37% in
1973/74 and are expected to increase by a further 322 this year. Dollar ex-
port prices rose 472 last year, but are expected to increase only 7% this
year (1974/75).  If international and domestic wheat prices do not rise above
present (March 1975) levels, however, then the rate of inflation in Pakistan
will probably decline in the coming months.
9.        The deterioration in Pakistan's balance of payments resulting
from increased imports, particularly of wheat, and the adverse changes in the
terms of trade are reflected in an increase in the current account deficit
plus debt repayment from US$235 million in 1972/73 to US$680 million in
1973/74 and US$1,465 million in 1974/75. The deficit in 1974/75 has been
financed to an important extent by aid from OPEC countries (US$450 mil-
lion) although about US$90 million of short term borrowing and some drawing
down of exchange reserves has also been necessary.
10.       Pakistan's external public debt at the end of June, 1974, amounted
to about US$6.0 billlon equivalent, of which US$1.7 billion was undiabursed.
Of this total, about $450 million represented debt incurred on account of
projects visibly located in Bangladesh and negotiations are now underway as
a result of which it is expected that most of this debt will be assumed by
Bangladesh. At present Pakistan does not have a severe debt service problem
largely because of the arrangement, concluded last June, whereby countries
participating in the Pakistan Consortium agreed to provide US$650 milllon
equivalent in debt relief over four years. However, the increased borrow-
ing that has become necessary means that debt service will probably grow
substantially faster than exports. By 1980, even assuming borrowing on
relatively favorable terms, Pakistan's debt service may well exceed 20% of
foreign exchange earnings,  Including undisbursed balances, Pakistan's debt
to the Bank and IDA now represents about 16% of its external public indebted-
ness; by 1980 this ratio might increase to about 18%. The share of the Bank
Group in total debt service (after taking account of the debt relief which
Pakistan will receive from other creditors) is now about 28%, but is expected
to decrease to about 14% in 1980.



-4-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
11.       The Bank and IDA made 31 loans and 38 development credits to
Pakistan between the start of operations in 1952 and 1971, totalling
US$1.2 billion. After becoming a member of the Bank and IDA in August
1972, Bangladesh agreed to assume liability for 11 credits totalling
US$151.4 million for uncompleted projects and recently assumed liability
for a further US$92.4 million in loans and credits on account of completed
projects visibly located in its territory. During FY72-74, the Bank and
IDA made 7 loaus and credits to Pakistan amounting to US$224 million.
12.       Of the gross amount of US$1.2 billion lent to Pakistan (East
and West), West Pakistan received about 72%.   During its long association
with Pakistan, the Bank/IDA has been involved in almost all sectors of the
economy. Until 1972, 38% of the total commitments were for public services,
29% for agriculture, 22% for industry, 10% for industrial imports, and 1%
for education. Lending for public services amounted to some US$325 million
and included loans and credits for railways, electric power, gas pipelines,
Karachi Port, highways, telecommunications and water supplies.   A large
part of the lending for agriculture was for Indus Basin projects.   The
lending for industry has been mostly through the Pakistan Industrial Credit
and Investment Corporation (PICIC). Fqr most projects for which loans and
credits arp being disbursed, construction is now going ahead satisfactorily.
The principal probleims being encountered are that the rates charged by some
of the public services have not kept pace with inflation and, hence, some
utilities,are not earning the return which they need.   Furthermore, some
institutions have financial problems arising from the loss of assets in
the former East Pakistan. -These problems are the subject of current dis-
cussions between the Bank and the Government. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of February 28, 1975 and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
13.       Our lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives.
The first of these is to support the directly-productive sectors of the
economy to increase production of import-substitutes such as foodgrains,
edible oils, fertilizer and engineering and capital goods and to sustain
export growth in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other
industrial and agricultural products. The main part of our assistance for
industry will continue to. be through financial intermediaries, such as
Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC), the Indus-
trial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) and the newly established National
Development Finance Corporation (NDFC) which is to provide finance primarily
for industries in the public sector and for which the present credit would
be made. The most important part of future lending for agriculture is
expected to be for the government's new program to increase productivity in
the Indus Basin by controlling salinity and improving the utilization of
surface irrigation and groundwater. A mission recently appraised the



- 5 -
Khairpur East tile drainage project and is now preparing its report. Other
projects in the agricultural sector on which preparatory work is proceeding
include seeds multiplication, agricultural credit, livestock, and rural
development. In addition, the Government has requested the Bank Group to
be the Executing Agency for a UNDP technical assistance grant for improving
agriculture and water planning in the Indus Basin.
14.       The second objective is to continue to improve the institutions
which are responsible for the principal public services which have benefitted
from Bank Group lending in the past, namely, Karachi Port Trust, the Tele-
graph and Telephone Department, the Water and Power Development Authority,
the Pakistan Railways, and the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Company. In most
of these, institutional improvements are being made with technical assistance
financed by the Bank Group.
15.       The third objective is to expand lending operations in other fields,
particularly those which reflect the Government's efforts to bring economic
development to the poorest strata of the population. The Government proposes
to give high priority to rural development. However, Government rural devel-
opment programs are still in an early stage of formulation. A mission to assist
the Government in the preparation of a project for rural development has
recently visited Pakistan. At the Government's request a mission has
recently studied the plans for the urban development of Karachi, whose
population now exceeds 4 million. A Karachi master plan was recently
completed with the assistance of consultants financed by UNDP, and urban
projects are being developed within the framework of this plan. In view
of the preparatory work which has already been done on urbanization
problems of Karachi, there are good prospects for worthwhile participation
by the Bank Group in this area. The Government has also asked the Bank to
study the urbanization problems in Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city.
Planning in Lahore is at a much earlier stage than in Karachi and the
immediate need is for technical assistance. A mission to examine problems
of urbanization and regional development on a country-wide basis is now in
Pakistan.
16.       During this fiscal year, in addition to the loan now proposed,
a credit for telecommunications was approved last September and a proposal
for a loan for the expansion of the gas pipeline system will be presented
to the Executive Directors shortly. Projects for seed multiplication and
for tile drainage have been appraised and preparatory work is well advanced
for an education project, a power transmission project and a project for
water supply and sewerage in Lahore.
17.       IFC has made nine investments in Pakistan for a total of US$28
million, of which US$20.7 million was by way of loans and US$7.3 million
by equity participations. (These are shown in Annex II). About US$13
million remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include
three in the field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles, and one
each in steel, cement and fertilizers. IFC is also a shareholder of PICIC.

PART III - INDUSTRY IN PAKISTAN
General
18.       In terms of its contribution to the gross domestic product,
manufacturing is the second largest sector of the Pakistan economy (about
16%). Nearly 80% of industrial output is estimated to originate from
medium- and large-scale industries and about 20% from the small-scale
sector. However, about three-fourths of the industrial labor force is
employed in small-scale establishments (less than 10 employees). Manu-
facturing, as defined in the census of population and labor force survey,
utilizes about 16% of the total labor force of about 19 million. The 1972
devaluation and associated import liberalization reduced some structural
distortions and are helping to promote fuller utilization of existing
capacity. Despite diversification of the production structure in the past
ten years, the share of agro-based industries (textile, sugar, edible oil,
paper, leather, tobacco) has remained almost constant at about 60% of total
industrial value added, while chemicals (mainly pharmaceuticals and fer-
tilizers) and engineering industries each account for about 10% of indus-
trial value added. Almost half of industrial output is produced in Sind
(mainly Karachi) and more than 40% in the Punjab. The Northwest Frontier
Province produces less than 10% and Baluchistan less than 1%. The Govern-
ment, through fiscal incentives and administrative measures, is promoting
the location of industries in less developed areas. The chief element of
the past growth strategy has been the development of industries based on
processing domestic agricultural materials, particularly cotton textile
mills serving both domestic and world markets. The initial phase of indus-
tralization was primarily import substitution, but since the late 1950's
there has been a continuing expansion of production for export, particularly
in textiles. Manufacturing production, which had grown rapidly during the
sixties, stagnated in 1971 and declined in the following year. Since then,
however, there has been a significant revival of industrial activity - again
based largely on a rapid increase of exports, particularly of cotton textiles.
The manufacturing sector experienced a growth in production of 11.8% in FY73.
A drop in the growth rate to 6.8% in FY74 reflected the high price and scarcity
of certain raw materials, a weakening of the export markets for textiles, the
impact of the floods and continued low levels of investment in the private
sector.
19.       The Government has stated that its objective is a mixed economy
with a dynamic private sector and that it wishes to encourage the inflow
of foreign private capital. Last October, the Prime Minister pledged once
again that there would be no further nationalization during his term of
office. This has helped the private investment climate somewhat. In the
case of certain industries (e.g., iron and steel, cement, heavy electrical
equipment), the Government has restricted ownership to the public sector;
in the case of others (fertilizer, engineering, textiles, sugar, etc.), the



-7-
Government is encouraging investment in both public and private sectors.
Despite continuing uncertainty, some revival of activity in the private,
small- and medium-scale industrial sector is under way.
The Role of the Public Sector
20.       Until 1971, the public industrial sector consisted primarily of
units under the management and control of the Pakistan Industrial Develop-
ment Corporation (PIDC) which had been established to fill gaps in indus-
trial subsectors, e.g., mining, where entrepreneurship was lacking. In
January 1972, the Government took over the management of 31 private companies
in ten basic industrial categories. The management of foreign-controlled
enterprises and those with assets of less than Rs 10 million was not taken
over by the Government. The 31 companies accounted for some 8Z of total
Pakistani industrial assets, 5% of industrial sales, and 6% of employment
in firms with more than 100 workers. Shareholders were allowed to retain
shares and proprietary rights, but Boards of Directors were abolished and
the Government appointed new professional management, recruited mostly from
the private sector, under the overall direction of a Board of Industrial
Management (BIM). Late in 1973, the Government took over the entire equity
of the private limited companies and acquired majority ownership in the
public limited companies which had been taken over the previous year. The
Government has compensated the former owners through the issuance of special
15-year bonds paying interest at one percent above the Bank rate. At about
the same time, the Government also nationalized several other industries,
including vegetable ghee, shipping, oil distribution, raw cotton exports
and commercial banking. The Government now controls an estimated 25% of
industrial assets.
21.       In December 1973, the Government established, under the Federal
Ministry of Production, 12 Sector Corporations which now embrace 118 oper-
ating enterprises, including the recently nationalized industries, new
public units and a large number which were transferred from PIDC. More than
half of these units are in the manufacturing sector and the BIM is responsi-
ble for 62 of them. The Sector Corporations, to which the Government has
transferred its equity interest in the operating units, function basically
as holding corporations, while BIM and the Ministry of Production are
responsible for major management decisions. It is Goverment policy that the
Industrial public sector be operated on a sound commercial basis including
the retention of profits in Individual units after the payment of reasonable
levels of dividends and taxes, and that commercial relationa with other public
sector units would normally bo at market rates of interest for borrowing and
lending and at market prices for purchases and sales. Moreover, other things
being equal, the Government's policy is to give equal treatment to industrial
firms in the public and private sectors.
22.       Most Sector Corporations registered impressive growth of produc-
tion in FY74 - well above the national average of 6.8%. The largest output
and sales increase  have been recorded by the BIM units producing automo-



biles and farm equipment, steel and engineering products and chemicals,
including fertilizers. The average rate of capacity utilization of BIM
units has also improved, in line with the national trend, and the profit-
ability of the BIM units has risen significantly. Export sales by BIM
enterprises more than doubled to Rs 239 million last year and accounted
for 9% of the total value of manufactured exports. Cement shipments
represented about half the total. At the end of FY74, BIM units employed
nearly 28,000 people - 5.9% of the total industrial labor force in regis-
tered factories and 10.6% of employment in industrial enterprises with
more than 500 workers. As a result of the infusion of competent manage-
ment from the private sector as well as the managerial improvements insti-
gated by the BIM, these enterprises exhibit better accounting, cost control
and equipment replacement procedures today than they did when in private
hands.
Financing Public Sector Industry
23.       Prior to 1972, long-term public industrial investment was confined
largely to PIDC industries. Rupee expenditures were met through annual bud-
getary allocations while foreign exchange requirements were largely covered
by foreign loans and credits. With the takeover of the 31 private-sector
units and subsequent nationalizations and with the creation of the NDFC, the
present and prospective sources of financing have changed markedly. Total
financial assistance outstanding to BIM units increased 29% in FY74 to
Rs 1.88 billion. Working capital financing, provided chiefly by the commer-
cial banks, represented nearly half the total. The Pakistan Industrial
Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC) and the Industrial Development
Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) now account for much of the term lending, reflecting
the fact that several of their client firms are among those that have been
taken over recently. However, since PICIC is barred by its Charter from
lending to the public sector and since, in any event, its management prefers
to restrict its lending activities to private firms, PICIC has made no new
commitments for any enterprises the majority of whose shares were taken over
by the Government, although it is continuing to disburse on commitments
previously made. IDBP, although permitted to lend to public-sector enter-
prises, has traditionally concentrated on medium- and small-scale private
firms. Though by comparison, NDFC's role in financing the industrial public
sector has been relatively small, it is anticipated that this role will
increase substantially in the near future.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
24.       The project was appraised in October/November 1974.   A credit and
project summary is given in Annex III. A report entitled "Pakistan -
Appraisal of the National Development Finance Corporation" is being cir-
culated separately to the Executive Directors. Negotiations were held in
Washington from March 27 to April 27, 1975. The borrower was represented
by Mr. Amim Ullah, chairman of NDFC while the GOP was represented by Mr. M.
Mufti, Economic Minister, and Mr. M. Humayun, Financial Counsellor, of the
Embassy of Pakistan in Washington.



_9_
Role
25.       NDFC was established 4n 1973 to provide financial assistance,
both short and long-term, to undertakings which were wholly or partly owned
by the COP, which had been taken over and managed by the GOP under the Eco-
nomic Reforms Order of 1972, or which had been declared by the GOP to be an
eligible enterprise.
Ownership and Resources
26.       NDFC, located in Karachi, was established as a 100% Government-
owned Corporation with a total authorized capital of Rs 100 million, which
had been fully paid-in as of September 30, 1974. In addition, as of the
same date, NDFC's long-term local resource position was augmented by Rs III
million in long-term deposits, as well as about Rs 9 million in reserves.
NDFC has been able to attract deposits on account of its ability to offer
rates of interest between 1/2% - 1% above those of the commercial banks be-
cause it is not classified as a bank under the control of the State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP). NDFC does not at present have its own long-term foreign
resources though it has received foreign exchange authorizations from the
Government amounting to approximately Rs 30 million of which Rs 0.7 million
had been disbursed to clients who had borrowed from NDFC in local currency
to purchase the foreign exchange. NDFC had Rs 125.2 million in long-term
resources available for commitment as of September 30, 1974. As of the same
date, NDFC's short-term resources consisted of Rs 43.5 million in short-term
deposits as well as Rs 12.3 million of a Rs 50 million revolving line of
credit from the SBP. NDFC had Rs 19.2 million available for short-term dis-
bursements excluding the balance of the credit available from the SBP.
Board, Management and Staff
27.       NDFC's Board consists of 6 persons appointed by the Government, of
whom two must come from financial Institutions. The Chairman, Mr. Amin Ullah
who is also the Chief Executive, has been appointed for a three-year term
which expires in the latter part of 1976. The Chairman is an experienced
banker, who has spent most of his career with the First National City Bank
both in Pakistan and New York. The remaining Board members represent Govern-
ment units and financial institutions with a direct interest in NDFC's opera-
tions. The Chairman has followed a careful recruitment policy during the
first 15 months of NDFC's existence, having hired 20 professionals - includ-
ing experienced staff from PICIC, IDBP, commercial banks, and industry who
form the core of the senior staff. The Chairman is continuing to recruit new
staff as the level of operations grows, and has placed the highest priority
on the recruitment of engineers and market analysts.
Operating Policies and Procedures
28.       NDFC's Statement of Policy, adopted by its Board on June 5, 1974,
states that NDFC's objectives are "to promote industrial expansion and
economic growth in the country" by providing financial and technical assis-
tance for the establishment of new enterprises as well as for the balance,



- 10 -
modernization, and expansion of existing enterprises in the public sector.
Assistance can take the form of loans, equity investment, underwriting,
guarantees, suppliers' credits and export credits.
29.       During negotiations, a number of revisions in NDFC's Policy State-
ment were discussed. A condition of effectiveness of the proposed Credit
is that a revised Policy Statement satisfactory to the Association be ap-
proved by NDFC's Board of Directors. These revisions provide that NDFC will
normally limit its exposure in individual enterprises to 30% of its own net
worth, and that it will not normally finance more than 75% of total project
cost nor projects whose total cost is greater than $40 million. This will
ensure that sponsoring units provide a significant contribution to total
project cost and that NDFC will be able to finance projects where its share
would constitute a significantly large proportion of the total to ensure an
impact on the formulation of the project.
30.       Recently, NDFC has become actively involved in project formulation
at an early enough stage to ensure that it contributes in a significant way
to project preparation. Despite the newness of the institution, NDFC has
made good progress in developing sound appraisal standards. However, NDFC
proposes to upgrade the technical and marketing aspects of project appraisal
through additional recruitment and through a dialogue on subproject review
with the Association.
31.       NDFC's proposed interest rates on foreign currency loans are 10.5%,
or 2% above the cost of foreign borrowings. Though the rate of inflation in
Pakistan is running at 14% per annum, a 10.5% relending rate is appropriate
since the sub-borrowers will be bearing the exchange risk. This rate would
be slightly above those of PICIC (8-1/2% - 10-1/4%) and IDBP (8-1/2% - 9%),
reflecting recent increases in borrowing costs. NDFC's rate on local currency
term loans is 12% per annum, or 3% above the present Bank rate.
Past Operations
32.       Since NDFC began operations in July 1973, its total loan approvals
have been Rs 362.9 million to 53 projects of which Rs 104.9 million for 26
projects represented working capital financing. Cumulative disbursements
totalled Rs 120.7 million ($12.2 million) as of the same date. Total approv-
als increased from Rs 48.7 million in 1973 (six months) to Rs 321.4 million
in 1974 (nine months). NDFC has also approved Rs 7 million in equity invest-
ment to 7 companies.
33.       NDFC's portfolio has been well diversified by industry with chemi-
cals representing 29.1% by amount, steel and engineering, 25.0%, automotive,
17.7% and energy, 12.9%. Further, NDFC has provided an almost even balance
between short and long term lending reflecting the mixed banking nature of
NDFC's operations. The portfolio's geographical distribution reflects the
industrial sector distribution as a whole with a concentration in the prov-
inces of Sind (72.8%) and Punjab (25.8%), although it is expected that the
distribution should improve in favor of the Northwest Frontier Province and
Baluchistan as new public sector projects are developed.



Financial Position
34.       In 1973, NDFC earned slightly more than Rs 1 million in net profit
(it is tax exempt), while the first nine months of 1974 yielded a net profit
of Rs 7.9 million. Book value per share reached Rs 109 as of September 30,
1974, and a dividend of 8% is forecast for 1975. Since no term loans have
reached the repayment stage, the quality of portfolio is not yet measureable
from a collection point of view. Section 2.09 of the draft Project Agreement
provides that should NDFC's collection ratio fall below 80% of all payments
of principal and interest due to it in each fiscal year, together with any
payments outstanding from previous years (excluding arrears of less than
three months) the Association may withold approval of further sub-projects.
35.       NDFC's total assets grew from Rs 102 million in 1973 to Rs 288
million as of September 30, 1974. NDFC's total debt/equity ratio was 0.4:1
as of December 31, 1973 while its debt service coverage was a substantial
4.8:1. The draft Project Agreement provides in Section 3.05 for a long-term
debt/equity limit of 5:1 (where debt excludes deposits maturing within one
year from the date of receipt). Short-term deposits have been excluded from
the calculation on the grounds that they are expected to account for 5-6% at
the most of NDFC's total liabilities by 1979, that NDFC's liquidity policies
are adequate and that it maintains a prudent mix of short and long term de-
posits and matches the maturities of the sources and uses of funds. NDFC's
liquidity position remains extremely strong with net current assets of
Rs 167 million and undisbursed commitments of Rs 60.6 million. NDFC's ac-
counts have been audited without qualification by two well-qualified Pakistan
auditing firms.
Projected Operations and Resources
36.       Under the Fifth Five-Year Plan scheduled to begin on July 1, 1975,
public industrial investment is expected to amount to Rs 23.5 billion (67%
of total industrial investment) compared to 36.5% in the Fourth Plan. The
GOP has thus clearly indicated a significant shift in its policy in favor
of the public sector, though this investment includes a few very large pro-
jects such as the Karachi Steel Mill. NDFC would concentrate on financing
the smaller projects in the public sector.
37.       NDFC's total approvals are expected to grow from Rs 498 million
in 1974 to Rs 1,040 million in 1979, reflecting an overall growth rate of
15% per annum, in line with the Plan projections of industrial growth. For
the two-year period from April 1, 1975, it is estimated that NDFC's foreign
currency resource requirements on a commitment basis would amount to about
US$58 million. This is a conservative estimate, since it appears that some
of the foreign currency approvals between October 1, 1974 and April 1, 1975
(US$18.7 million) will have to await commitment for lack of foreign exchange.
The draft Development Cre(lit Agreement provides in Section 2.03(c) that ex-
penditure incurred from April 1, 1975 up to the signature of the agreement
for an amount up to $2,000,000 and for a maximum of 3 projects would be
eligible for reimbursement under the Credit. The proposed credit would meet



- 12 -
about 50% of NDFC's foreign currency requirements during this period. NDFC
expects to meet its remaining foreign currency requirements through borrowings
($20 million) in the early part of 1976, from the Asian Development Bank and
later from OPEC countries. NDFC's local currency disbursements of Rs 423.8
million for the period October 1, 1974 to December 31, 1976 should be met
primarily by uncommitted long-term resources, long-term deposits and debenture
issues. Over the next five years, NDFC is expected to finance about 14% on
a disbursement basis of large-scale industrial investment in the public sec-
tor. This will be concentrated primarily in the fields of cement, chemicals,
steel and engineering, agro-industries (vegetable ghee and sugar) and
automobiles.
38.       The proposed credit of $30 million is based on NDFC's present
foreign resource position and its projected foreign currency requirements
over the two-year period beginning April 1, 1975. The use of the credit
would be limited to expenditures for the import of capital equipment. The
credit would be made to Pakistan which would re-lend the proceeds to NDFC
at an interest rate of 8-1/2%. Repayments by NDFC would be in accordance
with a schedule substantially in conformity with the aggregate of repayments
to NDFC by its sub-borrowers. NDFC would relend at a rate of interest of
10.5% per annum, constituting a 2% spread, with the sub-borrower bearing
the foreign exchange risk. There would be a free limit of $1 million.
Given the large size of most potential loans, approximately 75% by number
and over 90% by amount of sub-projects financed under the proposed credit
would require prior approval of the Association.
Developmental Impact
39.       Although NDFC's impact on the public industrial sector has just begun,
it should become very significant in many areas. The projects NDFC finances
are expected to contribute to a greater diversification of the industrial
sector through concentration on the more advanced technological industries
such as chemicals, steel and heavy engineering, and energy. Some agro-
industries such as vegetable ghee and sugar will also be included. Secondly,
NDFC should contribute to a greater regional distribution of industry. Third,
the substitution of NDFC's appraisal and follow-up work for that of Government
Departments for those projects in the public sector for which it provides fi-
nancial assistance should lead to improved project performance over the long
term. Using a sample of 11 projects financed by NDFC to date, ex ante fi-
nancial rates of return show a weighted average of 13.5%, while the average
economic rate of return was 33.2%. Finally, NDFC is expected to become a
prime repository of operational and financial information on the public in-
dustrial sector through the receipt on a regular basis of complete produc-
tion, financial, and operational results from a large number of public sector
units. This, in turn, would allow a valuable input by NDFC to the formulation
of Government industrial policy in the public sector.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
40.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the
Association and NDFC, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a
resolution approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
41.       The draft Development Credit Agreement and the draft Project
Agreement contain provisions usual to agreements for loans and credits
benefitting development finance companies. The special feature described
in paragraph 35 of this Report is reflected in Section 2.09 of the draft
Project Agreement. A revision of NDFC's statement of policy satisfactory to
the Association is a condition of effectiveness of the Credit (Section 5.01(c)).
42.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
43.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.   Projects in Execution 
Cr. No. 50          Education:  US$8.5 Million Credit of March 25,
19T4; Closing Date:  June 30, 1M
The project has suffered major delays on account of acdninistrative
difficulties, shortage of building materials, lack of local funds, the 1971
war, the 1973 floods, and re-negotiation of some civil works contracts at
the agricultural university necessitated by sharp increases in the cost of
building materials and wages. Although 90% of construction is finished the
project will not be completed by the revised closing date. A further
extension -- from June 1975 to June 1976 -- will be necessary. Installed
equipment at the university represents more than 90% of the original
allocation. Of another $200,000 which has been made available for further
essential equioment, $120,000 has been ordered and the remainder is to be
procured by the extended closing date. Except for four overseas fellow-
ships, the other components of the project, i.e., equipment for technical
institutes and teacher training, have been completed.
Loan No. 376        Karachi Port:  US$17.0 Million Loan of March 14,
T_Mi; Closing Date: June 30, 1974
The project has been substantially completed.
Loan No. 548        Tarbela Dam: US$25.0 Million Loan of July 10,
1968; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The Loan is intended for residual financing, and disbursements
began in March 1975. On September 29, 1973, the Indus River was diverted
through tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage -- the construction
of the closure section of the dam -- to be undertaken. By June 30, 1974,
the main embankment had been completed to full height, and the first
impoundment began on schedule in July 1974. In early August, difficulties
were encountered in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one of
the tunnels necessitated the emptying of the reservoir, in the course of
which further damage was incurred. A program of remedial works is nearing
completion. Additional resources will be required to meet the costs of
the remedial measures and the situation is under consideration of the
Contributing Parties to the Indus Basin and Tarbela Development Fund Agree-
ments.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report arn
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan No. 590        Development Finance Company - PICIC:   US$400.
Million Loan of March 21, 1969; Closing Date:
September 30, 1975
This Loan has been fully committed. The original Closing Date
of March 31, 1974, has been extended to September 30, 1975 to enable
disbursements to be made for the last subproject.
Loan No. 621        Railways:  US$14.5 Million Loan of June 26, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on (a) the renewal and improvement of track and bridges,
and (b) rehabilitation and improvement for workshops and depots has been
satisfactory. However, the propo9al for the expansion of the marshalling
yard at Samasata has been dropped and the first stage of a new marshalling
yard at Pipri has been included instead. The original Closing Date of
December 31, 1972, has been extended by three years to December 31, 1975,
to allow time for procuremerrt of materials required in the construction
work at Pipri. Because of a further delay caused through relocating the
yard, a further extension of the closing date may be necessary. Consul-
tants (Sofrerail, France) have been appointed to assist in implementation
of measures for improved operations.
Cr. No. 157         Agricultural Development Bank:   US$30.0 Million
Credit of June 26, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31. 1974
The project became effective on September 23, 1969 and the original
Closing Date (June 30, 1972) was extended to June 30, 1975.
During recent months there has been an improvement in tractor
supply to Pakistan and this Third Credit should be fully disbursed by the
revised Closing Date. The Agricultural Development Bank (ADBP) has
submitted an application for a Fourth Credit. Before it can be considered,
however, ADBP requires rehabilitation both financially and administratively;
the East Pakistan liabilities issue has not yet been resolved, resulting in
ADBP incurring heavy losses due to- making reserves against servicing of
borrowings for loans made in former East Pakistan; total overdues are
increasing and have become almost unmanageable; and its lendirg policies
and organization require thorough review. IDA is pressing the Government
to deal with ADBP's financial problems and a decision is expected shortly.
With the agreement of Government and ADBP, IDA is helping with the engagement
of a team of consultants, through-UNDP, to assist with ADBP's rehabilitation.
If the application to UNDP is successful the aim is for the consultants to
be in Pakistan not later than M q 1975.
Cr. No. 177         Development Finance Company - IDBP: US$20.0 Million
Credit of February 11, 1970; Closing Date:
December 31, 1977
Amendments to the Credit Documents became effective on April 25,
1974. These enabled IDBP to resuiri utilizing IA funds to finance Pakistan
industry without bearing the financial risk, pending settlement of its



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 6 pages
liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. The
original Closing Date of December 31, 1974 was then postponed to
December 31, 1977. IDBP has continued to improve its operational standards
but recent envirommental developments, including a textile crisis have not
permitted an improvement in arrears, which is creating difficult liquidity
problems. While this situation remains, IDBP is expected to obtain the
necessary local funds from the State Bank of Pakistan. After a recent
supervision mission, the Association, in consultation with the Govenmment
and IDBP, is exploring ways in which some of the issues presently confronting
IDBP can be resolved. Utilization of the IDA credit is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 206         Engineering Education:   US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Closing Date: December 31. 1976
Overall the project is about 24 months behind schedule. Construc-
tion of staff housing has been delayed due to the shortage of counterpart
funds, but is expected to be completed by the Closing Date (December 1976).
Other construction and procurement of most equipment is expected to be
completed six months before then. Progress in staff development has been
unsatisfactory, largely because teaching salaries are low compared to those
in industry. The Closing Date of the project may be postponed because of
delays in recruiting experts. Civil works costs are expected to be about
85% above the appraisal estimate in rupee terms, but total projects costs
are unlikely to exceed the appraisal estimate of US$6.3 million due to the
1972 devaluation of the rupee.
Cr. No. 213         Pbwer Transmission and Distribution:   US$ 23.0
Million Credit of August 13, 1970; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
Implementation of the project, which had improved during the past
year, is presently suffering again from a setback which will require a
second postponement of the closing date to the end of 1976. The new delay
is caused by additional claims of Yugoslavian manufacturers on which
cumbersome negotiations are presently underway. Pending a satisfactory
solution of the discussion, the suppliers have stopped delivery of the
equipment. However, it is expected that the conflict with the Yugoslavs will be
settled shortly with a substantial increase in price allowed not only in
cost of material but in cost of erection.
The Credit is still limited to US$23 million with WAPDA and the
Pakistan Government realizing that any overrun will be taken care of by
their own resources.
Cr. No. 422         Third Karachi Port: US$18.0 Million Crdit of
July 19, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
Construction has not yet started. Only one highly qualified bid
was received for each major contract and these are still under consideration
by KPT.

Loan N4o. 961       Industrial Investment:  US$25.0 Million Loan of
January 31, 1974; Closing Date: June 30. 1978
The Loan was made to the Government to be administered by PICIC
rather than directly to PICIC pending settlement of PICIC's foreign currency
liabilities with respect to projects it had financed in Bangladesh. PICIC's
arrears have remained high which is creating serious liquidity problems.
This has mainly been the result of environmental developments including a
textile crisis. While this situation remains, PICIC is expected to obtain
the necessary local funds from the State Bank of Pakistan. Its management
has also been weakened after the departure of some of its senior staff
including most recently, the Deputy Managing Director. After a recent
supervision mission, the Bank, in consultation withthe Government and PICIC,
is exploring ways in which some of the issues presently confronting PICIC
can be resolved. Up to January 30, 1975, sub-projects amounting to US$8.4
million had been credited. Disbursements amounted to $150,000.
Cr. No. 466         Flood Rehabilitation:   US$35.0 Million Credit of
March 18, 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
Good progress was made in restoring the protective bunds and canals
damaged during the 1973 floods, by a mechanized contractor and local labor-
intensive methods. Most of the work was completed before the 1974 monsoon,
in which slight rainfall resulted in some of the lowest river flows on record.
The restoration of road works has been considerably slower, and provisions
made under the credit for importation of spare parts for the repair of
construction and farming machinery have been delayed due to administrative
difficulties, with the result that spares and serviceable equipment are still
in very short supply.
Cr. No. 492         Fourth Karachi Port:     16.0 Million Credit of
July 8, 19747 Closing Date: December 31, 1979
Tender documents have been issued to prequalified contractors and
bids are due for opening on July 21, 1975.
Loan No. 988        Multan Fertilizer:  Us35.0 Million Loan of
May 24, 1974; Closing Date:  June 30, 1977
Procurement is making good progress and order for 95% of the value
of plant materials financed with the aid of the Bank loan have been placed.
About 50% of the plant being financed by the ADB loan has also been ordered.
First shipments of equipment are anticipated in June 1975. It is now
estimated that there will be a foreign exchange cost overrun of about US$20
million, which has been met by an additional equity contribution from the
Government of Abu Dhabi.
Cr. No. 510         Third Telecommunications: US$36.0 Million Credit
of           12, 197_;_Closing Date: December 31,
1978
Tender documents for all major items have been prepared and axe
being issued. Progress on the project is proceeding as scheduled.
