PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 546-PAK)
HIGHLIGHTS
Credit 546-PAK of US$30.0 million was the first and, to date,
only credit to the National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC).
The credit was granted to NDFC in 1975 for onlending to industrial
projects in the public manufacturing sector and was the first credit
to a Government owned DFC in the South Asia Region. IDA's main
objectives were to: (i) develop NDFC into a sound financial insti-
tution; (ii) assist GOP through NDFC in shaping new investments in
public industrial projects through rigorous project appraisal; and
(iii) cortribute to GOP's industrial policy and efficiency of public
sector units through sector studies,
The project was completed after a delay of 24 months although
84% of the credit had been disbursed on schedule. The delay is
attributed mainly to procurement problems of one large subproject
(Kohat Cement). IDA's objective of building NDFC into a sound finan-
cial institution capable of mobilizing domestic resources has been
met as NDFC has emerged as a mixed bank providing full range of bank-
ing services. NDFC is highly regarded by its clients, financial
community and GOP. NDFC was less successful in meeting other project
objectives due to resource constraints and the rapidly changing socio-
political factors during the implementation period. In retrospect,
these other objectives were relatively ambitious given the 'infant'
status of NDFC at the time of appraisal and unforeseen changes in
GOP policies. Given the difficult and uncertain environment in which
NDFC has been operating, NDFC's management has performed well and
established NDFC as a viable development financial institution. The
following points are of particular interest:
- the changes in GOP's industrial policy (paras. 4-5)
which diffused the role of NDFC during the project
implementation period;
- the mixed bank nature of NDFC which made it possible
to provide both working capital and term loans to
its clients (paras. 22-23); and
- the promotion of the local capital goods industries
(para. 28).

NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 546-PAK)
I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.      Credit 546-PAK for US$30.0 million was the first and to date the only
credit to the National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC). The Credit
Agreement was signed on May 15, 1975 and provided for an onlending rate from
the Government (GOP) to NDFC of 8.5% p.a.; and a composite repayment period
of 15 years, including a grace period of three years. The credit was
expected to be fully committed by September 30, 1977, and disbursed by Sep-
tember 30, 1979. However, due to delay in the implementation of one large
subproject, 1/ completion was delayed until December 31, 1981. At closure,
US$29.5 million has been disbursed leaving US$0.5 million to be cancelled.
2.      In 1972, as part of its package of social, economic and political
reforms, GOP took over the management of 31 major manufacturing enterprises
covering 10 subsectors. 2/ These units had total assets of Rs 2.2 billion
and accounted for about 8.0% of Pakistan's total industrial assets. 3/ A
Board of Industrial Management (BIM) was established, with the Minister of
Production as Chairman, to control these units and to carry out future
investments in the public industrial sector. In January 1973, GOP estab-
lished NDFC as a mixed bank to provide local and foreign currency assistance,
both short and long-term, to the units taken over in 1972, and to the
industrial units already wholly or partly owned by GOP.
II. ENVIRONMENT
3.      At the time the Credit was made, the political and economic situation
in Pakistan was in flux. GOP was introducing a number of measures in the
field of industrial operation and investment, labor relations and agrarian
tenancy. The rupee was devalued from Rs 4.76 to Rs 9.9 to the US dollar and

the export bonus system with its multiple exchange rates was abolished. From
1972 until 1977, GOP continued its program of nationalization by taking over
the vegetable ghee industry in 1973, commercial banking and shipping in 1974,
and flour milling, rice husking and cotton ginning in 1976. In line with
this policy of expanding the role of the public sector, industrial investment
increased rapidly from Rs 1.1 billion, or 42.6% of total industrial invest-
ment in FY75 to Rs 6.1 billion, or 74.3% of total in FY78 (Table 1). This
was mainly due to large investments in basic industries, i.e., steel, cement,
fertilizers and the expansion of the other nationalized industries.

Economic Survey
4.      Partly as a result of GOP's policy of nationalization and partly as a
result of the loss of market in East Pakistan, manufacturing production
declined in FY72 but increased rapidly in FY73 and FY74 as the industrial
sector recovered from these disruptions. However, from FY75 to FY77 the
sector stagnated with an annual average growth rate of only 0.81% p.a. In
FY77, GOP announced a number of significant changes to its industrial policy.
Investment in public sector enterprises was curtailed and a number of
industries were opened to the private sector. To this end, GOP provided a
number of fiscal incentives to stimulate private investment. These included
reduction of the long-term lending rate from 14% to 11%, enhancement of
export financing facility and the granting of numerous tax exemptions to the
textile industry and new industrial undertakings. Foreign exchange borrow-
ings were encouraged under the non-repatriable foreign investment schenie.
5.      The policy changes introduced produced positive results both on the
economy and on the manufacturing sector. From the stagnation in FY75-FY77

output increased with significant contributions to GDP. In FY78, the manu-
facturing sector griw at a rate of 9.2% compared with 7.4% for the economy,
with the growth momentum maintained thereafter except for the temporary set
back in FY79 due to the second round of oil price increases. During
FY80-FY82, the sector outperformed the economy and grew at an average annual
rate of 9.3% compared with 6.4% for the economy (Table 2).

Performance of the Public Sector
6.      The performance of most sector corporations after nationalization was
poor due to: (i) the lack of operational autonomy; (ii) management changes;
(iii) labor unrest; (iv) GOP's policies such as price control. In FY77, GOP
appointed a Commission to study their problems and recommend ways to improve
their efficiency. The Commission recommended a number of measures, including
the appointment of boards of directors for each corporation to monitor their
performance and enable them to function more independently. Accordingly, the
Economic Reforms (Amendment) Ordinance, 1978, was passed and the boards of
directors for a large number of companies were constituted. The majority of
the members on the boards are Government nominees, although there are repre-
sentatives of the private sector. Subsequently in 1978, GOP passed the
Transfer of Managed Establishments Order No. 12 of 1978" to enable the return
of nationalized units to the former owners. 1/ In 1979, the control over
public enterprises was transferred to the Ministry of Production and the BIM
was abolished to allow companies to operate more independently under the
guidance of their boards of directors.
7.      With these changes, the autonomy of public sector units was sig-
nificantly increased and this has resulted in a general improvement in over-
all efficiency (Table 3). In FY82, the public manufacturing corporations
(PMCs) as a group earned a pretax profit of Rs 921 million on sales of Rs 18
billion compares with Rs 0.7 billion and Rs 15.2 billion, respectively in
FY81. However, the return is inadequate and clearly shows a need for further

improvement. In 1980, GOP/IDA undertook a detailed study on the problems of
public enterprises and identified a number of policy and procedural changes,
including the need to introduce performance evaluation criterion. 1/ This
last recommendation is being implemented as a condition of the Structural
Adjustment Loan, which was approved in 1982. An expert cell has been estab-
lished in the Ministry of Production and a sample of firms has been selected
to operate the new performance evaluation system. GOP is also considering
implementing other policy recommendations, including mergers and disinvest-
ments of small units.

III. OBJECTIVES OF THE CREDIT
8.      Until 1975, the Bank Group has been lending entirely to private
industry through the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation
(PICIC) and the Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP). However, at
that time both institutions were facing severe operational and financial
problems due to the loss of a large portion of their assets in East Pakistan
and the devaluation of the Rupee by 131%. PICIC concentrated its financing
on large/medium-scale, private sector enterprises and IDBP was catering
mainly to small and medium-sized industries. NDFC, therefore, has an impor-
tant role to play in providing financial assistance to the nationalized
industries which were facing serous financial and operational problems.
GOP's industrial policy in 1975 clearly preferred the dominant role of the
public sector in industry especially in the non-textile subsectors. IDA felt
1/ "Efficiency of Public Manufacturing Enterprises" dated August 1981 by
Leroy Jones.



-5-
that it could play a key role in assisting GOP in addressing some of these
problems by working with NDFC, as local intermediary to:
(i) provide more balanced financial packages for public
sector corporations.
(ii) shape new investments in public industrial projects
through the application of high project appraisal
standards and independent assessment;
(iii) develop a primary repository of information on public
sector units; and
(iv) contribute to GOP's industrial policy and efficiency
of public sector units through sector studies to identify
and offer solutions affecting policy/operations.
IV. CREDIT UTILIZATION
9.      Although there was a general slump in the economy in FY77, a substan-
tial portion of the credit (US$23 million) was committed by September 30,
1977 the original closure date for submission of projects. At GOP's request,
the terminal commitment date was extended to June 30, 1978 by which time the
credit was fully committed.
10.     By the credit closing date of September 30, 1978, US$25 million had
been disbursed. The undisbursed balance of US$5 million related to the Kohat
Cement and Mustehkam Cement subprojects which were not implemented on
schedule due to delayed Government approvals, changes in civil designs, and
delayed execution of contracts. To accommodate these delays, the closing
date was extended first to November 30, 1980 and subsequently to December 31,
1981. As of December 31, 1981, US$29.5 million has been disbursed and the
balance US$0.5 million in respect to the Kohat Cement Project was cancelled.
Overall, the utilization of the credit was satisfactory.
Characteristics of Subprojects Financed
11.     Twenty-two subprojects were financed under the Credit (Annex 1) of
which seven projects (32%) were above NDFC's free limit of US$1 million and
ranged between US$1.4 million and US$4.6 million, while the remaining (68%)
ranged between US$57,000 and US$1 million.  By size of subloan amount, 89% of
the Credit went to projects requiring between US$0.8 million and US$3 mil-
lion. The regional dispersion of the subloans shows concentration of financ-
ing in Sind (43%) and Punjab (37%). This follows the historical pattern of
industrial development in Pakistan which GOP has been endeavoring to rectify.
However, efforts were made by NDFC to reach the less developed regions, i.e.,
NWFP and Baluchistan, which together received 20% of the credit.



-6-
12.     Sectoral distribution of the Credit was concentrated in the energy
and cement sectors which together utilized 56% of the Credit. Of the US$10.8
million utilized by the energy sector, US$7 million went to two oil companies
(POL/OGDC) which together generated net foreign exchange savings of about
US$70 million. The cement sector received US$5.7 million or 19.3% of the
credit through loans to two cement units for Balancing, Modernizing and
Rehabilitation (BMR), one new cement project (Kohat Cement) and an expansion
project to double the capacity of an existing project (Mustehkam Cement).
13.     About 76% of the credit was utilized for BMR and expansion projects.
The new subprojects which accounted for US$7 million or 24% of the credit,
were Kohat Cement (US$4 million) and two chemical subprojects (National
Fibres and Ravi Rayon Limited) which received US$0.9 million each.
14.     Annex 2 provides details on the status of subprojects financed under
the credit. As of December 31, 1981, 10 projects involving loans of US$16.6
million were under construction or in pre-operating stages. Nine projects
involving loans of US$12.2 million were operating profitably and three
projects with loans of US$0.8 million were facing technical or financial
difficulty. While the performance of subprojects financed by NDFC appears to
be satisfactory, a full assessment can only be made two to three years from
now when the projects are completed and operational.
15.     In terms of the economic benefits, the Credit resulted in a capital
mobilization ratio of 1:8.2 (US$243 million). The projects financed under
the credit generated a net foreign exchange savings/earnings of US$153 mil-
lion p.a. The total direct employment generated by the 22 projects was about
6,621 with a capital/job cost ratio of US$36,000. Based on NDFC's appraisal
reports, the ex ante economic rate of return of the 10 major subprojects was
between 15-50% (Annex 2).
V. PERFORMAANCE OF NDFC
Institutional Aspects
16.     Management and Organization.  Since its creation in 1973, NDFC has
had reasonable continuity of top management. The first chairman (a commer-
cial banker) guided NDFC's operations from 1973 until mid-1978,  For twelve
months NDFC was under the control of a caretaker chairman and in mid-1979,
GOP appointed NDFC's present chairman, a former civil servant in the Ministry
of Finance.  No fixed term of appointment was set by GOP for any of the
appointments, although NDFC's Act provides that an appointed chairman will
serve for an initial period of three years. The continuity of appointment of
the present chairman has allowed NDFC the management guidance needed during
the periods when GOP was introducing its changing policies for the public
sector.



-7-
17.     Under its three chairmen, NDFC has evolved an organization structure
which generally meets the needs of NDFC's operations. Functional groupings
for appraisals, end-use and administration are sound, although NDFC's opera-
tions could be improved by having the proper organization and procedures
necessary to cope with the increasing volume of working capital operations.
18.     Staffing and Training.  Since 1973 NDFC has experienced a continuing
loss of seasoned officers. This loss has had a considerable impact on the
quality of NDFC's operations, particularly project appraisals and subsector
analyses. Within its powers NDFC has attempted to minimize the level of
resignations which are due, in large part, to the uncompetitive salary struc-
ture allowed by GOP for the specialized staff of the Development Financing
Institutions (e.g., PICIC, IDBP, etc.). Also, NDFC has followed a sound
program of graduate recruitment and training.
Procedures and Standards
19.     Appraisals.  While the general standard of NDFC's systems and proce-
dures are satisfactory, there exists scope for improvement in NDFC's project
appraisals which could be more analytical, objective and balanced. In par-
ticular, there is still a need to give: (i) a clearer definition of sub-
project objectives; (ii) an indication of likely development impact; (iii)
a more indepth and detailed sector and market analysis; and (iv) realistic
assessments of cost and project implementation periods.
20.     End Use.  With the establishment of an End Use Division in 1979,
NDFC's project supervision activities have shown a continuing rate of
improvement. The scope and depth of end use operations is generally com-
prehensive, although there is variation in the quality and a lack of focus
upon the key problem areas for corrective action to control arrears. While
NDFC's portfolio is predominantly public sector, with NDFC having the ability
to affect arrears against payments due to GOP, these weaknesses do not assume
great importance. However, as NDFC expands its operations into the private
sector, there will be a need to concentrate upon them, in order to minimize
arrears.
Research and Development
21.     Up to 1980, NDFC had done little in the way of substantive project
development and research activities.  Where subsector studies had been car-
ried out the criteria used in the selection of the subsectors was not clear
and there appeared to have been little relationship to NDFC's portfolio
investments or proposed lending strategy.  The studies which were carried out
were satisfactory in the area of review, but did not address such aspects
as the economic and social significance of sectoral operations, legislative
or policy constraints. More recently, NDFC's sector work has attempted to
address these aspects, with satisfactory results.

Operations
22.     Unlike most DFCs associated with the Bank Group, NDFC is a mixed bank
wqhich provides working capital and term loans. NDFC is also permitted by its
Act to mobilize resources directly from the public by way of deposits and
other financial instruments such as debentures.  Table 4 provides a summary
of NDFC's operations since its inception in FY73. Characteristics of
projects financed by NDFC are given in Annex 3. 1/

23.     NDFC's operations were sluggish during the first three years of its
operations (1974-76) due to the teething problems involved in establishing a
new institution and the uncertain economic climate. NDFC concentrated on
making term loans out of the IDA credit, its equity, and suppliers' credits
from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). NDFC at that time was headed by an
experienced commercial banker, who placed emphasis on mobilizing domestic
resources by way of deposits and running NDFC as a commercial concern. Since
the bulk of deposits were of less than one year in maturity, NDFC had to
place the funds accordingly for liquidity reasons. As of December 31, 1976
about 39% of NDFC loans were for working capital.
24.     NDFC's role was clearly defined until 1977 when GOP changed its
industrial policies. As public industrial investment was restricted and the
role of private sector enhanced, NDFC's role was diffused. The situation was
1/ For the entire operation of NDFC.



-9-
further complicated by the fact NDFC did not have a chairman for one year and
its long-term resources were restricted to the SBP's line of credits as
resources from multilateral sources were not available. NDFC's main resour-
ces were deposits from its public sector clients and the public (Table 5).

25.     Because of the scarcity of long-term resources and disincentives for
term transformation, 1/ NDFC had no choice but to make working capital loans.
NDFC's present chairman, who took office in 1979 adopted a new strategy of
diversifying and mobilizing additional resources. However, due to the delay
in obtaining additional term resources, the composition of NDFC's business
changed dramatically. By December 31, 1981 cumulative loans for working
capital amounted to Rs 3.9 billion or 58% of the total compared with 39% in
1976 (Table 4). 2/ The share of foreign currency loans also declined from
36% as the end of 1976 to 20% by December 31, 1981 due mainly to the lack of
foreign currency resources. This position is likely to change only gradually
as NDFC mobilizes additional long-term resources which it can profitably
onlend. 3/
1/ In 1978, GOP reduced the interest rate for term loans from 14% to 11%
making it unprofitable to finance long-term loans with deposits.
2/ NDFC would have been able to carry out more terms transformation if the
interest rate on long-term had not been reduced to 11%.
3/ ADB's second loan of US$50 million became available to NDFC in early
1982.



-10-
26.     In 1979, in line with changes in GOP industrial policy, NDFC's role
and Statement of policy were redefined to allow it to finance private sector
projects which met the following criteria: (i) procuring at least 40% of
machinery requirements, in terms of value, from public sector enterprises,
or; (ii) procuring equipment for at least Rs 10 million in value from public
sector enterprises; or (iii) representing an industry originally earmarked
for the subsequently opened to the private sector. Subsequently in 1982, GOP
approved further amendments enabling NDFC to finance private sector projects
in capital goods and energy as well as projects costing up to Rs 100 million.
Thus, NDFC now can finance most projects in the private sector while continu-                 4
ing to be a banker for existing public sector enterprises.
Consortium Financing
27.     Since FY71J NDFC has actively pursued the use of consortium financing
to satisfy the capital requirements of its large public sector clients,
arranging 32 operations totalling Rs 1.8 billion of which Rs 0.3 billion was
in foreign currency. NDFC's share averaged about 8%. NDFC's consortium
activities tapered off during FY78/79 due to the decline in public sector
investment and NDFC's limited involvement with private sector. However,
NDFC's new management is giving renewed emphasis to this activity and NDFC's
involvement in consortium financing and co-financing with commercial banks is
likely to increase.
Promotion of Local Capital Goods Industries
28.     To encourage procurement of locally manufactured goods, SBP operates
a refinance scheme, which allows a spread of 2% to participating financial
institutions. Since 1973, NDFC has been the most active user of the SBP's
suppliers credit scheme. Up to December 31, 1981 NDFC has received 11
credits amounting to Rs 685 million (Table 6) with about 60% of the credits
financing sugar plants and 15% each to cement and power. NDFC's performance
in promoting the local capital goods industries has been better than P'ICIC
and IDBP, which also have access to the facility.

Financial Position
29.     Annexes 5 and 6 show NDFC's balance sheets and income statements for
FY76-FY81. Throughout this period NDFC's financial position has remained
sound with consistent growth in profitability, portfolio investment and total
assets. During FY76-FY81, NDFC's return on equity averaged over 20% and its
debt/equity ratio remained well below the agreed limit of 5:1. As of Decem-
ber 31, 1981 NDFC's arrears amounted to Rs 92.7 million, or about 4% of its
loan portfolio. NDFC's collection ratio remained at a satisfactory level
of 92% (Annexes 7 and 8).
NDFC's Performance Vis-a-Vis Credit Objective
30.     Overall, NDFC's operational and financial performance has been satis-
factory and IDA's institutional building objectives generally 1/ have been
met. NDFC has developed into a well managed and profitable development
finance institution, during a period in which other development banks in
Pakistan experienced a decline. However, the credit's other objectives
(para 8) were only met partially due to the changes in GOP's policy concern-
ing the public enterprises subsequent to the approval of the IDA credit and
the strategy adopted by NDFC management in coping with the rapidly changing
environment.  Since NDFC was established in 1973, the credit's objectives
(with the benefits of hindsight) were rather ambitious. Initially, NDFC's
ability to influence GOP policies was restricted by its size and lack of
recognition.  As these constraints were removed, subsequent GOP policy chan-
ges made it less essential for NDFC to be involved directly in the investment
planning stage of public sector investment.
1/ Organization and management, project appraisal and supervision, financial
planning, internal audit and other procedures.



-12-
31.     Since NDFC's foreign currency resources were initially limited to two
credits totalling US$60 million from IDA and ADB, NDFC mobilized domestic
resources by such means as deposits and debentures to expand its operations.
It also effectively utilized the suppliers credits from SBP to promote local
capital goods industries. In addition, NDFC successfully adopted its lending
strategy to respond to the new GOP policy of promoting private industries;
under a recent ADB loan of US$50 million, NDFC will lend half to private
industry. NDFC has also contributed to mobilizing resources for its clients
by way of consortium financing and syndications.
32.     At the time of appraisal, NDFC was expected to rely heavily on multi-
lateral institutions for resources and to concentrate its efforts on terms
lending operations. The mixed bank nature of NDFC was considered but the
subsequent drastic changes in the environment were not foreseen. Therefore,
IDA's projections of NDFC operations and the actual outcomes differed con-
siderably (Annex 9). NDFC was more successful in mobilizing domestic resour-
ces than envisaged by IDA and its pattern of lending evolved in a different
fashion. This difference was due also to the prevailing interest rate struc-
ture which created disincentives for financing term loans. 1/  Given its
financial objective and cost structure, NDFC had to minimize its local cur-
rency term loans to maintain its financial viability. The shortfall in
foreign currency lending was due to the fact that the capital requirements
of most large public sector projects were financed either by bilateral sour-
ces or through direct foreign borrowings.
33.     In terms of influencing GOP policy regarding public sector
enterprises. NDFC's role has increased as GOP now makes use of NDFC's
resources to carry out financial reviews of sector corporations. Its sector
work also has become more focused and operationally oriented although mnore
improvements are still necessary. The information depository function on
public enterprises has been taken over by the Experts Cell in the Ministry of
Production and there is no need for NDFC to duplicate this function.
VI. IDA'S ROLE
34.     IDA played an important role in assisting NDFC's management in build-
ing NDFC into a viable development finance institution capable of mobilizing
domestic resources and financing viable projects. IDA's involvement during
FY78/79 was useful in bringing about stability in NDFC's management at a time
of uncertain economic and political climate. IDA was also successful in
strengthening NDFC's appraisal, supervision and economic analysis procedures.
1/ Interest rate for long-term loan is presently 11% compared with the
marginal cost of funds for term deposit of about 14%. The rate for term
loan was reduced from 14% to 11% in 1978 by GOP.



-13-
IDA's performance in getting NDFC to increase long-term loans was not as
successful as expected, mainly due to the structural disincentive in term
lending. IDA attempted without success to convince GOP to make modifications
in its interest rate structure especially for term lending. This divergence
from the expected operational mix does not imply that NDFC has not played a
developmental role in Pakistan's public industrial sector. Over a time, NDFC
has built itself into a sound financial institution and now has a cadre of
staff which is respected for its financial and technical capability by the
public sector corporation, financial community and GOP. IDA's involvement
has definitely enhanced the role of NDFC, and both GOP and NDFC have indi-
cated a desire for the Bank Group's further involvement with NDFC.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
35.     Credit 546-PAK was granted to NDFC in 1975 for onlending to
industrial projects in the public sector and was the first Credit to a
publicly owned DFC in the South Asia Region. The project was completed after
a delay of 15 months due mainly to procurement problems of one large sub-
project. IDA's objective of assisting NDFC to develop into a sound financial
institution capable of mobilizing domestic resources has been met as NDFC has
emerged as a mixed bank, which is highly regarded by its clients, the finan-
cial community and GOP. IDA also expected NDFC to play a key developmental
role in carrying out studies, collecting data on public sector enterprises
and formulating policies affecting the public manufacturing sector for GOP.
However, NDFC was less successful in meeting these objectives due to resour-
ces constraints and the rapidly changing socio-political factors during the
implementation period. With the benefits of hindsight, these objectives were
relatively ambitious given the "infant" status of NDFC at the time of the
credit and unforeseen domestic changes in GOP policies.  NDFC's management
has responded well to the changes in environment and has built NDFC into a
viable financial institution.

should stand it in good stead to become a highly
useful organization. It augurs well under its
present Chairman.

treatment of various subjects and is very
satisfactory.
With regards,
Yours sincerely,
