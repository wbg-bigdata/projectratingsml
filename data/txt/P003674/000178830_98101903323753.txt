Fijian Spelling Systems:
Two spelling systems are used in Fiji, the "Fijian" system
and the "Phonetic" system.  The "Fijian" system, devised
by early missionaries and commonly used by the Fijian
people, represents the various sounds by single letters.
The "Phonetic" system is a more recent attempt to render
Fijian words in Ehglish spelling.
At the request of the Government of Fiji, the "Fijian"
system is employed for the place names in the Project
Loan Agreement. The "Phonetic" system is used in the
-Appraisal Report. For the sake of consistency, a glos-
sary of place names in both spelling systems follows:
"Fijian"'                   "Phonetic"

APPRAISAL OF A FIRST hIGHWAY PROJECT
Summary and ConclusioIIs
i.        This report appraises the bank's first project in its newest
member country, Fiji. The genesis of this project goes back to 1965 when
the Government of Fiji asked the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
tQ finance a comprehensive survey of its transport system. The survey was
completed in 1968 and, in the total investment package proposed, assigned
high priority to the improvement of the Suva-Nandi Road on thie principal
island of Viti Levu. In 1969, the Government retained the United Kingdom
consulting firm of Rendel, Palmer and Tritton to prepare a feasibility
study of this road and follow with detailed engineering. A Bank mission
appraised the project in August 1970; detailed engineering was completed
in December 1970.
ii.       Fiji's transport system has been greatly influenced by its to-
pography. Of the country's 300 islands, Viti Levu is the most important,
with 4,000 sq mi or 55% of the land area and 70% of the 527,000 popula-
tion. The highway network on this island consists of a periplheral road,
wLhich mainly follows the coast and links the two largest population cen-
ters, Suva, the capital and prinicipal seaport, and Nandi, a conmercial cen-
ter in the sugar-growing district where the irnternationLal airport is situ-
ated. Improvement of the Suva-Nandi Road is expected to stimulate the flow
of commerce on the main island, Viti Levu, and to give added impetus to the
development of tourismi on its southern ('Coral") coast.
iii.      The project inicludes: construction to two-lanie paved standards of
67 mi out of the present 130 mi gravel road between Suva and Nandi, and con-
sulting services for detailed engineering of the whole road and for con-
struction supervision of the 67 mi to be improved. The remaining road length
between Suva and Naridi requiring improvement could be considered for subse-
quent Bank financing.
iv.       The total project cost, includinig contingencies, is US$16.6 million.
This includes a foreign exchange component of US$11.8 million, which the Bank
is being asked to finanice.  The (Government's development budget will meet the
local costs. The two construction conitracts will be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding; construction supervision will be carried
out by con.sultants. The Minlstry of Comlnunications, Works, and Tourism
(MCWT) will be responsible for execution of the project.  The Governmenit has
asked the bank to nieet retroactively the foreign exchange cost of the de--
tailed engineering (US$000,00() out of US$750,00)0 total); tihis amount is
Lncluztied in the project.



- ii -
v.        The principal economic benefits from the project are savings in
vehicle operating costs on the roads to be constructed; the proposed con-
struction will yield a rate of return of 18% on the investment.
vi.       The project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$11.8
million equivalent. An appropriate term is 24-1/2 years, including a 4-1/2
year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF A FIRST HIGIWAY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Fiji, an island group in the South Pacific Oceani, was a British
Crown Colony until achieving independence on October 10, 1970. It now
holds Dominion status within the british Commonwealth and is the newest
Pacific island member of the United Nations, the International Monetary
Fund, and the Bank.
1.02      In 1965, the Government asked the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) to make a comprehensive survey of the tranisport sector
and suggest improvements which could be incorporated into Fiji's overall
economic development plan. The survey was conducted between July 1966
and 1968 by a transport team of the UNDP, with the United Nations acting
as Participating and Executing Agency. The team proposed an investment
program of F$38 million for the next 10 years and suggested investment
of two-thirds of the total in roads. Although the Bank had some reserva-
tions on the total investmenit package proposed, the study brought out
clearly the priority need of the Suva-Nandi Road project. A United King-
dom consulting firm, Rendel, Palmer and Tritton (RPT), made a feasibility
study of this road project in 1969, and confirmed both its importance and
its economic value. The same firm then undertook the detailed engineering,
which was completed in December 1970.
1.03      Income from tourism is becoming a major contributor to the econ-
omy since it has an annual growth rate of about 25%; appropriately, the
first Bank project in Fiji includes construction of a road which will
have considerable impact on this industry's further development in a key
area, thie southern "Coral" coast of the main island Viti Levu.
1.04      The project comprises reconstruction to two-lante paved standards
of 67 mi of the present 130 mi Suva-Nandi Road and consulting services for
detailed engineering and construction supervision of this road. The high-
way to be reconstructed replaces the narrow, winding gravel road linking
Suva,the capital and principal seaport, and Nandi, in the heart of the major
sugar producing area and the site of the international airport.
1.05      The total project cost is estimated at US$16.6 million.  The
(Government has requested a Bank loan of US$11.8 million so meet the project's
foreign exchange costs (70% of the total). The local costs of the project
will be provided from Fiji's developmsent budget.

1.06      This report was written by Messrs. R.J. Mulligan (Engineer) and
I. Ahlstrand and R. Rafloski (Economists), following project appraisal in
August 1970. Mrs. P. Valad edited the reporL.
II. BACKGROUND
A. Economic Setting
2.01      Fiji is a group of 300 islands with a land area of about 7,000
sq mi, and lies about 2,000 mi northeast of Australia in the South Paci-
fic Ocean (Map 1). About 100 of these islands are inhabited, with onlv
two of any economic significance: Viti Levu, about 4,000 sq mi in area
(the same size as Jamaica), and Vanua Levu, about 2,200 sq mi in area.
Of Fiji's total population of 527,000, which is increasing at 2.8% p.a.,
70% lives on Viti Levu and 20% on Vanua Levu.
2.02      Fiji's per capita Gross National Product (GNP) of US$410 is re-
flected in living standards higher than in most developing countries, and is
due primarily to ics efficient smallholder sugar industry. The GNP lias ex-
panded at 5% p.a. over the last five years, with the tourism industry showinig
the most dynamic growth. Sugar and copra account for 95% of Fiji's manufactur-
ing incustry. The main minerals exploited, on Viti Levu, are gold and
manganiese.
2.03      Economic development has been greatly restricted by Fiji's to-
pography. Coral reefs surrounding the islands have impeded coastal ship-
ping. Thickly wooded volcanic mountains covering the islands' interiors
have barred cross-country movements. The population, therefore, has settled
along the coastal lowlands of the two main islands. As a result of this
peripheral development, the agricultural and other potentials of the inte-
riors have not been fully exploited.
B. The Transport Sector
(a) General
2.04      Fiji's strategic location, in the direct trans-Pacific line of
communication between the Australian and North-American continents, makes
it a convenient intermediate stop for both shipping and air lines. The
main land transport modes are limited by the difficult terrain to peripheral
road and rail networks, but they adequately serve the transport needs of
goods and passengers.



-3-
(b) Highways
2.05       Fiji's highway network in 1970 was restricted to only four
islands: Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni, and Ovalau; it totaled about 1,650
mi, of which only 105 mi of main road and 18 mi of secondary road were paved.
About 1,050 mi of the network are on Viti Levu, with the principal element
being the peripheral main road that, for the most part, follows the coast
and includes the link from Suva to Nlandi.  The balance of the network is
mainly on Vanua Levu, where the roads radiate from Lambasa, the comnercial
center and port of the sugar industry, into the north, south, and interior.
The Taveuni road follows mainly the northern coast and terminates at its
port, while the Ovalau road follows the southern coast and penetrates the
interior, providing access to the airstrip. The highway systeni is die-
cusse(I further in Chapter III.
(c) Railways
2.06       The railway network consists of a 70-year-old narrow gauge line,
totaling about 400 mi, located generally on the western and southcentral
coasts of Viti Levu. It is owned by the South Pacific Sugar Nlills Company,
and is exclusively a freight transport facility serving nearly all cane-
growing areas. In 1969, it carried 70X of the 2.3 million ton sugar cane
production for an average haul of 20-25 mi; the remaining 30% was carried
by road. Railway service is efficient and the company has no intention
of adopting any other mode to carry cane; it is thus unlikely that any ad-
ditional cane traffic would be diverted to roads.
(d)  Shippin
2.07       Ships traveling between the Australian and North-American con-
tinents, as well as those plying among the islands, use Fiji's port fa-
cilities. There are two main ports and about 3U0 loading points in Fiji.
The two main ports, Suva and Lautoka on Viti Levu, handle traffic effi-
ciently. Over the last 10 years, goods handled in Fiji's ports have in-
creased 6% annually.  Suva is the largest port; it has deep-water berths
suitable for large passenger liners and offers bunkering and provisioning
facilities.  In 1969, it handled 274,000 tons of imports and 100,000 tons
of exports. Lautoka received 95,000 totis and shipped 249,000 tons in 1969,
including the bulk of Fiji's raw sugar exports.  The facilities at these
two ports are adequate for at least another five years, but expansion will
be needed sometime thereafter.  The loading points on the outlying islands
serve Fiji's inter-island shipping which, on an unscheduled basis, trans-
ports mainly cargo but also some passengers. Port charges were increased
recently to bring revenues into line with costs, including depreciation
of investments.
(e) Civil Aviation
2.08       Internationally, air transport is significant as the principal
means by which tourists enter and leave Fiji (about 82,000 people visited



4-
the country in 1968). Fiji is a convenient refueling stop for trans-Pacific
flights. Domestically, air transport provides passenger service between
islands, but it does not carry a significant amount of freight.
2.09      Fiji has one principal international airport and several smaller
airports. The mail international airport, Nandi, serves eight of the world's
major airlines; it is owned and operated by the South Pacific Air Transport
Council and administered by New Zealand. Operating costs are borne by
Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, with Fiji meeting a minor
portior. Improvemvints are being made to runways so that jumbo jets can be
served; completion is expected by the end of 1972 when Fiji will take over
administration of the airport.
2.10      The second largest airport is Nausori, which serves Suva.  From
Nausori, Fiji Airways provides a daily service between Suva and Nandi on
Viti Levu, and Savusavu and Lambasa oni Vanua Levu, and to neighboring Pac-
ific island groups. In 1969, Fiji Airways provided domestic (within the
Fiji islands) and regional (to other southern Pacific islands) flights
for 97,000 and 20,000 passengers, respectively. Fiji Airways is economi-
cally sound and is owned equally by the Governments of Fiji and Tonga, the
Western Pacific High Commission, Air New Zealand, BOAC, and Qantas.
C. Transport Planning and Coordination
2.11      The Ministry of Conmmunications, Works and Tourism (MCWT) is the
agency responsible for transport coordination and planning. The need for
coordination, in the traditional sense of ensuring that competition between
road-rail or other modes takes place along economic lines, is not a problem
in Fiji.  The need has been for adequate planniing to ensure that transport
sector projects are appropriate in size, timing, and location to the specifi .
goals determined by economic analyses and, in the case of feeder roads, that
they reflect the agricultural priorities for Fiji's development. A rigorous
analysis along these lines was not done in the past and, to remedy this
situation, the Governnment is arranging for the services of a transport econ-
omist to assist the MCI!T for two years.  Tihe Britishi Commonwealth Secretariat
has agreed to finance his services.
III.  ThE  IICGHWAY SECTOR
A. The Highway Network
3.01      As shown in Table 1, Fiji's public road system in 1970 comprised
701 mi of main roads (105 mi of which are paved), 286 mi of secondary roads
(18 mi of which are paved), and 670 mi of unpaved country, feeder, and
residential roads. Between 1965 and 1970, the total length of public roads
i.creased about 5% p.a. Most mileage increases represent upgrading of sub-
standard feeder roads and tracks, and not new road construction.



- 5 -
3.02      In addition to the above network, about 180 mi of unpaved roads
are maintained by the Forestry Department of the Ministry of Natural
Resources. These are not proclaimed public roads, and are primarily for
access to forestry areas and the extraction of timber.
3.03      Although the road networks on the two main islands connect the
populated areas, further improvements to the road pattern are needed.  Viti
Levu, for example, is presently served by a peripheral main road.  A few
gravel roads lead off this main route to serve important agricultural and
mining areas, but further feeder roads will be required to develop the re-
maining limited areas of agricultural potential. On Vanua Levu, the MCWT
is presently planning a 19 mi road section which will complete the link
between Lambasa, the commercial center of the sugar-growing area, and
Savusavu, the seaport (MIap 1).
B.  Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic
3.04      Between 1960 and 1969, Fiji's motor velhicle fleet grew at about
9% p.a. from about 6,600 to 14,500 velhicles, with passenger cars increasing
at 11% p.a. and botih trucks and buses increasing at 6% p.a. (Table 2).  The
proportion of trucks and buses in the fleet consequently decreased from 45%
to 31%. About half of the vehicles are registered in Suva and its suburbs
and about three-quarters of all vehicles will come within the influence area
of the project road. Between 1962 and 1969, fuel consumption increased at
an average annual rate of 4.5% for gasoline and 10% for diesel fuel (Table
3). These figures are not entirely reliable as an indicator of road traf-
fic growth because fuel is used in marine craft as well as in motor vehicles.
3.05      Trucks, buses, and taxis make up a large part of the road traffic.
The trucking industry consists of a large number of owner-driven vehicles.
Average utilization of trucks on the Suva-Nandi Road is low, at 50% to 55%
of hauling capacity, indicating that truckers have difficulty in obtaining
return loads. Competition is unrestricted and rates are therefore low. A
license is required only for commercial passenger transport. With the ex-
ception of thiree companies owning more thian 20 buses each, the bus industry
is comprise(c of a large number of small operators.  The number of taxis is
sufficient to meet demand, and growth of the fleet is controlled by closely
restricting the issue of operators' licenses. About half the taxi fleet
is owner-operated.
3.06      Until 1968 only a few manual traffic counts were undertaken in
Fiji, the results of which are considered unreliable.  The Public Works
Department has now established a special traffic section.  Its first task,
an origin and destination survey for tLl- Suva-Nandi Road, was carried out
between August and October 1968 in cooperation witlh the consulting firm
RPT before it niidertook the feasibiliLy study (para. 1.02). Traffic counts
are now being made on a regutlar and systematic basis. During loan negotiations,
the Covernment gave an assurance that thlese counts will continue and the re-
sults will be collated systematically.



-6-
3.07      Regulations governing maximum dimenisions and axle loading of
vehicles are adequate. Weighing stations exist at the docks at Suva and at
the sugar mills at Lautoka and Lambasa, but they are seldom used to enforce
axle load restrictions. A portable weighbridge is operated occasionally by
the police for spot checks oni vehicles. Vehicle overloading does not appear
to be serious at present, but during loan negotiations the Government gave
an assturance that dimenisions and axle loads of vehicles will not exceed thie
limits appropriate to Ihighway design standards.
C.  Hilhway Administration
3.08      The MCWT is responsible for all public works, posts and telecor.
munications, tourism, marine transport, and aviation (see Chart).  T'ese
functions are assigned to three Secretariats, with the Secretary for Works
being responsible for all public works including public roads. Road plan-
ning, design, materials testing, and general control of equipment and con-
struction operations are handled at headquarters through the Under Secretary
for Engineering, while road maintenance and construction are controlled by
three D)ivisional Engineers who report to the Deputy Secretary for Works.
Given the small size of the country and the correspondingly small volume of
public works, a separate roads department is hardly justified; the present
organization functions fairly efficiently arid no major reorganization is
considered necessary.
3.09      The headquarters and divisional offices are adequately staffed; new
recruits on contract are tending to replace older permanent staff who are
taking advantage of the opportunity for early retirement whi ch has beejl
offered them on Fiji's attaining independence.  There is sufficient conti-
nuity of staff to permit the department to function effectively.
D. Ilighway Maintenance
3.10      Maintenance of Fiji's higlhway network is the responsibility of the
MCWT's divisional organizations for public works, which do a very creditable
job considering the problems they face. These include a wide range of rain-
falls, scarcity of suitable gravels at many locations, and mountainous ter-
rain where difficult soils conditions are encountered. In addition, nearly
half the gravel-surfaced main roads of Viti Levu carry relatively hiigh traf-
fic volumes of about 200-300 vpd, and these traffic figures may be greatly
exceeded near the larger towns. The Government is preparing a program for
improving these sections in order of priority.
3.11      The central mechanical workshops located in Suva have full
maintenance and overhaul facilities for the MCWT fleet. Divisional work-
shops are adequately equipped and staffed for routine maintenance and
repair works.



- 7 -
3.12      The MCWT normally undertakes maintenance work using its depart-
mental forces with equipment-intensive methods. Some maintenance operations
are performed by contract, such as supply and haulage of some of the MANT's
gravel requirements, and supply of crushed stone for concrete and bituminous
surfacing works. The Government's policy is to foster local industries and
the future use of contractors for these and similar operations will probably
increase.
3.13      Annual expenditures on road maintenance between 1965 and 1969 are
shown in Table 4. These include costs of labor and materials and operating
costs for equipment (without depreciation), but exclude administration.
Although the rate/mi declined from F$930 (US$670/km) in 1965 to F$745
(US$535/km) in 1969, the latter figure still permitted adequate maintenance
to be performed. The downward trend lhas since been halted; the 1970 alloca-
tion was F$760/mi (US$545/km) and the MCWT has requested still higher
maintenance allocations under the Government's Development Plan VI (1971-75)
to keep pace with expected growth of the highway network and traffic.
3.14      Although at the time of project appraisal some basic information
on the road network appeared lacking, particularly in the areas of road
inventory, traffic counting and cost accounting of road maintenance operations,
the Government has reacted positively to the Bank's suggestions for :mnprovements
and has since made significant progress in carrying them out. A road in-
ventory is being compiled, the Ministry's recently formed traffic section is
carrying out a program of systematic traffic counting (para. 3.06) and investi-
gations are in hland to see how best the Ministry's progress reporting methods
may be adapted to provide the required cost data on road maintenance. Should
the need for assistance arise, the Government hias agreed to consult the Bank
on the nature of consulting services which the UNDP would be asked to
finance.
L.  Highway Engineering and CoIstruction
3.15      The Chief Road Engineer in the Public Works Department is respon-
sible for executing road projects, and his headquarters organization is suf-
ficiently staffed to undertake the normal workload of surveys and design.
The services of consultants are used for larger projects, such as the Suva-
Nandi Road construction. Hlighway design standards are satisfactory.
3.16      itighway construction is normally executed by the MCW1's ownl con-
struction teams.  A small domestic contracting, industry (about six contrac-
tors) is normally employed on municipal works. Each-i contractor has about
F$0.1 million invested in equipment, and, since their total annual capacity
for work is about F$0.5 million (US$0.6 million), it is unlikely that
any of them will bid for project contracts but could possibly serve as sub-
contractors .



F. highway Financing and Planning
(a) Financing
3.17      Table 4 sihows hlghway income and expen(liture from 1965-69.  Annual
income from taxes on the import of vehicles, fuel, lubricants, and tires
and tubes, and from vehicle license fees not onily covered annual maintenance
and administrative expenditures but also contributed substantially toward
new road investments. Additional funds needed to cover total road invest-
ments were obtained by grants from Colonial Development and Welfare Assist-
ance. During this five-year period, total annual road expenditures were
practically stationary in monetary terms, but in real terms they decreaF *
due to a price increase of about 10%.
3.18      As showr in Table 5, annual road investments proposed under Devel-
opment Plan VI covering the period 1971-75 show a sharp increase comparec
to the previous five years. This increase is due principally to the expccted
improvement of the Suva-Nandi Road; after its completion in 1976 or 1977,
total road expenditures are expected to decrease to nearer the current lexTe&.
As highway income is expected to slhow only a modest increase during Develop-
ment Plan VI, the Government plans to obtain the necessary additional in-
vestment funds from the Bank (about F$12 million) and from British developl-
ment loans (about F$0.5 million).
(b) Planning
3.19      Two major deficiencies existed in the planning of road projects
included in Development Plan V (1966-70). First, the economic priorities
of projects were not established, and second the completed costs of most
projects were more than double the estimates (F$7.2 million actual com-
pared with F$3.5 rmillion estimated) because of inadequate planning. The
first deficiency should be remedied by the services of the transportation
economist (para. 2.11). With the Suva-Nandi Road construction (engineered
by consultants) dominating Development Plan VI (1971-75), the MCWT will now
have the time to complete detailed engineering for those remaining projects
it intends to execute and will thus have a firmer basis for cost estimates;
this will remedy the second deficiency.
3.20      In addition to the provision for the Suva-Nandi Road, about
F$l million is included in Developmelnt Plan VI (1971-75) for new developnmeut
roads. These roads are planned through the Rural Development Campaign,
which gives villages the opportunity to help decide which roads are to be
constructed to meet their essential needs. These proposals are coordinated
into district development programs and are irmplemented after approval by the
Development Committee (a subcommittee of the Council of Ministers).



_ 9 _
3.21      A possibility for further Bank participation in Fiji's road devel-
opment could be the construction of the center section (43 mi) of the Suva-
Nandi Road, wlhich should follow some three to four years after commencement
of this project (paras. 4.03 and 5.03). By that time, the transportation
economist should have identified further roads for which feasibility studies
and, later, detailed engineering should be undertaken, and such studies
could also be considered in a future Bank project.
IV.  llll PROJECT
A. General
4.01      The proposed project consists of:
(a) construction to two-lane paved standards of 67 mi
of the present 130 mi gravel road between Suva and
Nandi; and
(b)  consulting services to:
(i) prepare detailed engineering for the entire Suva-
Nandi Road; and
(ii)  supervise construction of the 67 kii of the Suva-
Nandi Road to be improved.
B.  Suva-Nandi Road
4.02      The existing gravel road between Suva and Niandi follows a winding
alignment characterized, for much of its length, by poor visibility and
steep gradients. As a first step toward improving this key route, the
Government commissioned RPT, the consultant, to investigate the economic
and technrical implications of replacing it with a new two-lane, bitumen
surfaced road. RPT recommended a route wlhich shortens the distance be-
tweeni Suva and Nandi by about 20 mi and considerably improves the allgn-
menit in the hilly and mountaiinous terrain.  The consultant's proposals
and the design standards adopted (Table 6) are satisfactory.
4.03      The central 43 mi section of the road, however, has a low eco-
nomnic priority compared with the outer two-thirds and, for this reason,
its construction should be deferred some three to four years until traffic
hlas furthier increased. Accordingly, the Government has decided that this
portion should be omitted from the present project wlhich now comprises
the two enid sections described below.



- 10 -
4.04      The two end sections of the whole road appropriately constitute
two construction sections: (a) the 26 mi from Suva to Deumba; and (b) the
41 mi from Korotongo to Nandi (including the 1-1/2 mi Nandi bypass). The
existing road from the city limits, the terminal point of section (a), into
Suva can handle traffic from the project road until about 1980. A Govern-
ment-financed land use transportation study of the Suva urban region is now
being uindertaken by consultants (Freeman Fox & Partners of the United
Kingdomi). Their findings are expected in about two years, leaving enougl
time for building the additional facilities needed for adequate traffic
capacity and distribution. During loan negotiations, the Government gave
an assturance that it will take all reasoniable steps to distribute traffic
into Suva from the project road, and that It will consult witlh the hiank on
the nature of such distribution facilities and the timetable for tiheir c x-
ecution. At the Nandi end, RPT proposed a 1-1/2 mi bypass of the town, as
well as a connection at the town boundary to its main street. The combined
capacity of these facilities will be adequate for the forecast traffic from
the Suva-Nandi Road beyond 1990.
C. Detailed Engineering
4.05      RPT completed detailed engineering and tender documents in Decemn-
ber 1970. The Government has asked the Bank to meet retroactively the for-
eign exchange cost of the detailed engineerinig incurred since commencement
in November 1969. The total cost is US$750,000 and the foreign cost is
US$600,000; provision for the latter is made in the project.
D.   Cost Estimates and Foreign Exchange Component
4.06      The total project cost is US$16.6 million equivalent, including
contingency allowances and is suinniarized below:

4.07      RPT prepared the cost estimate for road construction on the basis
of completed detailed engineering. As there have been no contracts for sim-
ilar works in Fiji, RPT developed unit rates for the various quantities from
detailed breakdowns of labor, equipment, materials, and overheads. The firm
also supplied the actual cost of detailed engineering and estimated cost for
contract supervision. Contingency allowances for physical, price, and un-
certainty considerations are included. For physical quantities and for con-
sulting services they are 10%; for price escalation, 10% (representing the
average price increase estimated from preparation of estimates to completion
of construction). On the basis of available information, equal increases
are expected in local and foreign costs. A further 10% contingency allow-
ance is made because there is no history of major road construction contracts
in Fiji and contractors may expect and hedge against uncertain factors, such
as the application of import restrictions or taxes, and difficulties in re-
patriation of profits. If bid evaluations show that these problems have not
materialized, the 10% uncertainty contingency will be cancelled. During loan
negotiations, the cost estimates were confirmed with the Government.
4.08      With the exception of cement, all the principal materials used in
road construction, such as bitumen, reinforcing steel, explosives, fuels,
and lubricants, will be imported. Because there is no local contractor cap-
able of carrying out work of this magnitude, and there would be no incentive
for one to equip himself to do this large job since it is a one-time opera-
tion, the work most probably will be executed by a foreign contractor who



- 1 2 -
must import all his equipment. The foreign exchange component of construc-
tion costs are accordingly estimated at 70%. The foreign exchange costs for
consulting services are estimated at 80%.
E.   Project Financing and Execution
4.09      The proposed loan to the Government will finance the foreign ex-
change cost of the detailed engineering, construction, and construction sup-
ervision elements of the project. Local costs would be met by the Government
from funds earmarked in its development budget; no difficulties in providing,
these funds are foreseen.  The executing authority will be the MCWT, assistftd
by qualified consultants under ternis and conditions satisfactory to the lBank.
During loan negotiations, the Government gave an assurance that it will
promptly retain consultants for construction supervision.
4.10      The two construction contracts will be awarded on the basis of unit
prices after international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's
"Guidelines on Procurement". Contracts could be awarded about tihe end of
calendar 1971. Considering mobilization time, heavy rainfall, and difficult
soil conditions encountered on the eastern side of Viti Levu, a construction
period of 36 months is estimated for the 26 mi Suva-Deumba contract; the 41
mi Nandi-Korotongo contract, to be executed under somewhat better climatic
conditions and in more favorable terrain, can be completed in the same time.
On this basis, all construction should be completed about the end of 1974 ur
early 1975.  Land acquisition is proceeding ahead of schedule and is not ex-
pected to delay the project. During loan negotiations, the timing and pro-
cedures of project execution were confinred with the Government.
F.   Disbursements
4.11      Disbursemenits of the loan will be on the basis of 70% of the cost
of highway construction and the actual foreign exchange cost of consulting
services.  Any surplus funds remaining in the Loan Account on comlpletion ot
the project will be cancelled. A sclhedule of cuniulative quarterly loan dis-
bursements is shown in the Annex.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.   Background
5.01      The project road will greatly improve the main transport link in
Fiji between the capital, Suva, in southeastern Viti Levu and the densely
populated sugar areas around Nandi and Lautoka in the northwest. At the
same time, the project will accelerate the local development of tourism
and agriculture along the road. About 60% of the population of Fiji lives
in areas directly influenced by the project road and about 75% of the
vehicles are registered in those areas.



- 13 -
5.02      The Government's Development Plan VI (1971-75) for the transport
sector gives the highest priority to the project road. The technical assis-
tance included in the project will lay the groundwork for an adequate main-
tenance program and appropriate investment planning for transport.
5.03      RPT studied the economic priority of different sections of the
Suva-Nandi Road. Traffic on the two end sections is on the average about
65% higher than on the middle section, which mainly carries through traffic.
The middle section is in difficult terrain and construction costs would be
high; the first year benefit would be only about 7% and the average rate of
return would be 12%. Thus the Government has agreed that construction should
be deferred until it is economically justified.
B.   Project Area
5.04      The 26 mi section from Suva passes through high rainfall areas
where cattle are raised and timber is produced. This section ends at Deumba,
an area closest to Suva with high potential for tourism. Recently, an Aus-
tralian contractor started work at Deumba on a US$6.5 million contract for
resort infrastructure, aimed primarily at providing retirement homes for
people from overseas. In the first phase, sites and services will be pro-
vided for 1,300 homes.
5.05      The 41 mi section of the project road between Korotongo and Nandi
traverses a major sugar cane producing area. It will connect the Singatoka
Valley, which has good possibilities for increased vegetable production, with
Nandi and the northwest, and also will link the international airport at
Nandi and Natandola Harbor, which is only 30 mi away and is considered to have
the best potential for tourism development in Viti Levu (Map 2).
C.   Project Road
5.06      The average daily traffic in 1970 was 554 vehicles from Suva to
Deumba and 615 vehicles from Korotongo to Nandi; about 30% of traffic con-
sists of trucks and buses. Recent data indicate a traffic growth rate of
14%; this trend is expected to continue over the next few years because of
the dynamic growth of areas served by the project road and the impact of
tourism development (para. 5.04). However, with a larger velhicle fleet in
later years, it is assumed that the growth rate of traffic will decline.
The traffic growth rate on the project road for private cars is assumed at
10% p.a. from 1970 to 1985, declining gradually from 10% to 5% p.a. between
1985 and 1995. For trucks and buses, the growth rate is assumed at 4.5%
p.a. for the whole period. Traffic induced by the new road sections is es-
timated at about 20% of existing traffic for cars and 10% for trucks and
buses. The foregoing is shown in Table 8.
5.07      When the project road has been constructed, travel time for cars
between Suva and Nandi will decrease from about 4-1/2 hours for 130 mi to
3-1/4 lhours for 115 mi. The decreased travel time and transport costs will
result in diversion to the project road of the traffic between the Mba



- 14 -
area (on northern Viti Levu) and Suva, which now travels via Rakiraki (Map
2). This diverted traffic is expected to amount to about 3% of existing
traffic on the project roads. Part of the air traffic between Suva and Nandi
also is expected to be diverted to the road, but it is not possible to esti-
mate this diversion accurately.
D.  Benefits from the Project
5.08      The main quantifiable benefits resulting from construction of the
Suva-Nandi Road would be the savings in vehicle operating costs. Table 9
shows that the operating costs for cars would decrease by 22% (from 8.74 to
6.81/mi) and for trucks and buses by 30% (from 15.1 to 10.5U1mi).  Tourism
and agriculture would benefit indirectly from the project, but these bene-
fits have not been quantified. In 1968, about 82,000 tourists visited Fiji
and their number has increased at a rate of 25% p.a. for the last seven years;
this expansion is especially important in the Suva-Nandi Road area. The bot-
tleneck for expansion of tourism has been the limited supply of hotel facili-
ties. Investors have been reluctant to commit funds because of the poor road
connections; however, it is likely that construction of the project road would
foster the expansion of hotel facilities. Agriculture in the Singatoka Valley
also would benefit indirectly from the project.
5.09      Based on the estimated vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings (Table
9) and project traffic, the Suva-Deumba section of the project road will give
a rate of return of 17% over a 20-year period, with a first-year benefit of
9% in 1975 (the year of completion). The Korotongo-Nandi section of the proj--
ect road will give a rate of return of 19% and a first-year benefit of 11%.
rhe combiaed rate of return for the two sections will be 18%.  The sensitivity
of these results was tested on the basis of a combination of a plus or minus
15% change in construction costs; a 20% change in traffic growth rates, in-
cluding generated traffic; and a 10% change in VOC savings. This resulted in
a range of 13% to 23% as the minimum and maximum possible average returns for
the combined sections. Returns on the various combinations are given in Tablc
10. The project is, therefore, justified.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During loan negotiations, the Government gave assurances on a number
of points. The principal point is that the Government, in consultation with
the Bank, will take all reasonable steps to ensure that traffic from the
project road is adequately distributed Into Suva (para. 4.04).
6.02      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$11.8 million equivalent, with a term of 24-1/2 years, including a 4-1/2
year grace period.
