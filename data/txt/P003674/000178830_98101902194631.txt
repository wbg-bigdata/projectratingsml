INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
PROPOSING AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF THE LOAN TO FIJI
FOR THE FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT (771-FIJ JUNE 30, 1971)
I submit the following report and recommendation proposing an increase
in the Bank loan to Fiji for the First Highway Project from US $11.8
million to US $16 million to help finance cost overruns.    There would be
no change in the repayment period or in the interest rate of 7-1/4 percent
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.     A report entitled "The Economic Prospects of Fiji" (No EAP-18a,
dated October 6, 1970) was circulated to the Executive Directors on
November 3, 1970.   The next economic mission to Fiji is scheduled for
1973.   More recent information has been obtained from a 1972 IMF mission
report and through statistics sent by the Fiji Government.    Basic country
data are given in Annex II.
3.     Fiji became independent on October 10, 1970 after nearly 100 years
as a British colony and is now an independent member of the British
Commonwealth.   It is composed of a group of over 300 islands in the
South Pacific with a total land area of some 7,000 square miles.    It has
a population of slightly over 500,000 of which about 90 percent live on
the two main islands, Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.    The gradual transfer of
political power was accompanied by a program of local recruitment at all
levels of government which has helped to ensure competent leadership and
a well managed administrative system after independence.    In the first
post-independence election in April of this year, the Alliance Party, based
largely on the support of the Fijians (42 percent of the population) and
European and Chinese minorities (8 percent), retained political power.
Under the Constitution, the Indian community, which forms 50 percent of
the total population, is somewhat under-represented politically, although
Indians have considerable economic power especially in trade and commerce.
Serious racial tensions have been avoided.
4.     Fiji's economy is more complex than its small size might suggest.
In addition to coconut production, it has developed an efficient
smallholder sugar industry that was established with indentured labor in
the 19th century.   There is also a wide range of other crops, a number of
small industries, some mineral development and a developed services sector
within which tourism now has a leading role.    GDP grew at about 5 percent
annually in real terms during 1966-70 and 6 percent in 1971.    Per capita
GNP is about US $430 and growing at an average annual rate of about 2.5
percent.   Major factors in the steady economic growth have been the rapid
expansion of investment, the burgeoning tourist industry and up until 1970



2
the expansion of the sugar industry.    Sugar output fell by about 11 percent
in 1971 due mainly to bad weather.    Foreign exchange earnings from tourism
increased from US $8 million in 1965 to over US $39 million in 1971 or about
30 percent per year, making it the largest gross foreign exchange earner,
surpassing the sugar industryr whose earnings amounted to US $38.8 million
in 1971.
5.     The Government's fiscal performance is satisfactory.    Largely due
to increased collections of customs duties and income taxes, government
revenue rose from 19 percent to 23 percent of GDP during 1966-70.    Groos
investment has been increasing by about 12 percent a year and by 1970
represented over 30 percent of GDP.    Much of this investment is export
oriented since Fiji is highly dependent on foreign trade, exports an.d
imports representing about 46 percent and 50 percent of GNP, respectivuh,
With the expansion of investment and incomes, merchandise imports, ris.-.n-
at 9 percent  per year in the late 1960's, have grown faster. thhan export;.
which rose at 7 percent annually.    The growiing trade deficit has been
financed by increased tourism receipts, private capital inflows and somie
grant assistance from the U.K.    As a result, Fiji has been able to
maintain a strong foreign exchange position, witm reserves at the end of
1971 equal to about five mon.ths' imports.
6.     The widespread damage caused by the recent severe typhoon haJ
resulted in sorne disruption, and in tUhe short run it may slow the expansion
of the economy and cause somie temporary budgetary strains.   However, over
the long term, Fiji's growth prospects are basically sound.    The Government 's
strategy for economic development is outlined in the Development Plan
1971.-75. It calls for an average growth rate of 6.7 percent a year during
1971-75, with cGntinued steady expansion in agriculture and manufacturing
and further strong growth   r-n tourism.  The future of sugar is somewhat
uncertain due to the ending of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement in 1974 with
new arrangements to be negot.iated before then with the enlarged European
Econommic Community.  Aggregate investment is projected to grow at about
8 percent a year, but because of limited capacity, particularly in the
construction industry, the rate may prove to be somewhat less.     On this
more conservative ass-amption the deficit on the goods and non-factor services
account may amount to some US $56 million over the period 1973-77.     Taking
into account other projected. external obligations, such as debt service,
;Fiji' S gross ca-pital requirements would total some US $150 million during
this period.   Slightly over half of this would be met by private investments,
and tne remainiinLg US $70 mi'llion by external borrowing and grants.  Projected
disbursements from Bank loans would account for one-third of external
financing, and the rest woul d be met through assistance from the Asian
Development Banl; (ADB) and the U.K. and other bilateral lenders.
7.     Fiji's external debt is ve-ry small.   The ratio of debt service to
export earninas is expected to rise from 1 percent in 1970 to about 5 percent
in 1977.   Exports are unusually large in relation to GNP, and this ratio
means that by 1977 debt service will probably rise to about 10 percent of
domestic savings.    This burden should be quite manageable given Fiji's



3
relatively high per capita income, demonstrated capacity for economic
growth and strong reserve position.   Fiji therefore remains creditworthy
for borrowing on Bank terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
8.     After attaining independence in October 1970, Fiji became a member
of the Bank in May 1971.   On' September 29, 1972, Fiji became a member of
IDA and is considering whether to join IFC.    There have been two Bank loans
to Fiji amounting to US $14 million.   In addition to the First Highway
Project, for which an increase in the amount of the loan is proposed, a
loan for a Telecommunications Project was approved in June 1972 in the
amount of US $2.2 million.   The Bank is also executing agency for a UNDP-
financed tourism study which is expected to be completed by early 1973.
The study is expected to form the basis for Bank consideration of a tourism
project (probably related infrastructure) planned for FY 1974.
9.     The strategy of the Bank's lending program is to help bridge the
resource gap by financing the foreign exchange requirenments of a small
number of relatively large public infrastructure projects in the transport,
telecommunications, and tourism sectors.   This strategy has been chosen
because the steady growth of the Fijian economy in the late 1960's has
created a need for additional infrastructure and because the projects are
of sufficient size to justify Bank participation in their financing.
While adequate external assistance for other sectors is presently available
from alternative sources (such as ADB and bilateral aid), the Bank will
keep its lending program under review to determine where Bank assistance
can be most effective.   In any event this assistance will be relatively
modest in financial terms but should help to strengthen institutions in
a number of sectors.   A Bank economic mission scheduled to visit Fiji in
1973 will not only review the general economic developments but will also
consider questions relating to income distribution, employment and
agricultural policies and priorities.
PART III - THE PROJECT
10.     In June 1971, the Bank made a loan (771-FIJ) of US $11.8 million
to Fiji to meet the foreign costs of constructing two sections (67 miles)
of the 130-mile Suva-Nandi road.   Construction of the remaining section
was postponed, with financing contemplated under a possible second Bank
highway project.   The loan, which became effective on September 2h, 1971,
also provides finance for the detailed engineering of the whole road and
the supervision of construction.   A full description of the project and
its importance to Fiji's economy were given in the President's Report and
Recommendation for the First Highway Project (PA-967 dated June 14, 1971);
this material is reproduced in Annex III and an updated summary of the
loan and project is given in Annex IV.



14
11.     Bids for the two construction contracts were invit.ed from 29
prequalified contractors and were submitted by December 31, 1971.     Nine
contractors responded and the lowest evaluated bids were more than twice
the project cost estimates on which the loan was based.
12.     In an effort to determine the reasons fLor such high bid prices
and to identify the major risks against which the bicdders appeared to be
hedging, the Government, wi-th its consultants, had discussions with
several of the low bidders,    The principal cau-ses identified Weref7   i
the logistical difficulties anc uncertainties of working in a sm.all
isolated country which had no history of larpje scale road ccne1     e
and second, the need to amortise equipment over the tnree-yea;-r ont' co
period rather than its full life, because of th.he lack of oppo.tunity fo:,
further work in Fiji.    On the basis of these discu.ssions, th-           .
concluded that savings could be achieved if fresh bids were callen or
the basis of revised plans and tender documents.     Ir agreement witth e
Bank, amendments to some technical specifications were incorporated) t',Je
scope of one contract was reduced and the construction period of bo`1
contracts, if awarded to one contractor, was increased from three to
four and a half years.
13.     The nine original tenderers were invited to s        fbmit fresh bids
and five of themi responded.   T`he lowest evaluated bid was for both
contracts togetner and was Labout 20 percent below the lowest amount
previously tendered.    The Government had been consideri.ng building one
of the two sections by departmental forces.     However, after carefully
reviewing its o-%n costs ard overheads as well as the problems of
recruiting personnel and accIuirin: equipment   the Government decided in
favor of doing the worK by contract.    The award of both contracts has
been made to the lowest bidier, Di-linghaf/Willkins/Green, an Australian/
US contractor (60 percent), in joint venture wi.h two New Zealand
contractors (20 percent each).    The Bank has agreed to this choice.
The Government has an option to withdraw from one contract if it is not
able to secure financing for the inlcreased project cost.
Project Cost
14.     The revised total project cost is estimated at US $31.8 million,
compared with the original total cost estimated at US $16.6 million.

6
15.     At the time of project aTpraiLsali the foreign exchange comnonent
of construction costs was estimated at 70 percent.   However, the lw bidder
has requested 55 percent of his tender price to be paid in foreign exchange.
In addition to these direct foreign costs, a further 20 percent has been
allowed to cover indirect foreign costs which include such items as fuels,
lubricants and other materials and supplies which the contractor can
purchase with Fijian currency, but which would represent a drain on the
country's foreign exchange reserves.   Thus, the total foreign exchange
component of the revised constructioin costs is estimated at 65 percent.
16.     The provision rnade under "Cornsulting Services" for construction
supervision has been increased to take account of the longer consti-action
period.   The amount allocated for detailed engineering has already been
disbursed.
17.     Physical contingency allowances remain tne same.   in the revised
project, the "Uncertainty" contingency is eliminated since the contract has
already been awarded but a price contingency of 10 percent has been retained.
Finanicing
l8.     On the basis of the revised cost, Fiji would need US $21.2 million
in foreign exchange to carry :ut the project.   Of this US $16.0 million
would be met by the Bank loan.   Australia has announced that it is prepared
to provide a loan of US $2.7 million and New ZeaLand a loan of US $,1.8
million to finance the bulk of the remaining foreign exchange cost.   The
detailed terms and conditions of these two loans are being negotiated by
Fiji, which is responsible for securing all the financing not provided by
the Bank.   Assuming that final agreement is reached with Australia and
New Zealand the Fiji Government would provide the remaining US $0.7 million
of foreign exchange costs and US $10r6 million equivalent of local costs
Lrom its own resources.
Disbursements
19.     1n order to help Fiji over its budgetary problems in 1973 caused
by bot,h the increased cost of the project and the need to repair the damage
done by the recent hu-1rricane, Lhe Bank would disburse 100 percent of the
cm tractcrsl mobilization palDnTnlt-.  Tne size of this palment, which would
not exceed 20 percent o.fL construction cost, is bused on the value of
ccntrac-tors' euipnment delivered to the site.  The Bank would finance
4. percenit of subseouen-t payments for civil works in order that disbursements
S.hoold extend over Lhe executi.on period.  In addition, the Bank would
disVhurs,e the fu7' !J oreign exchange cost for supervisory consulting
Economic iiate of Return
20.    ''he original economic Justification of t:ne project was based on
sa-:rigs in vehicle operating costs.  Passengers time savings were not



7
included, nor was it assumed that the intervening Section II connecting
the two project sections I and III would be constructed within their
economic lifetime.   On the basis of the increase in project cost and
taking into consideration general price increases since appraisal of
this project in August 1970 economic rates of return were re-calculated
on the alternative assumptions: (a) that the composition of benefits would
remain as assumed in the Appraisal Report, or (b) that the benefits would
include further passenger time savings, including savings on the increased
traffic that would result from construction in 1981 of Section II.    The
results of this re-calculation are shown below together with the economic
returns originally estimated in the Appraisal Report:
Appraisal   Revised Based on Assumption
Section                 Report      -    a)          (b)
I.  Nandi-Korotongo               19 %            16 %       24 %
III.  Suva-Deumba                   17 %            13 %       20 %
Total                         18 %           14 %        22 %
Thus, even under the more conservative assumption, both project sections
would still yield satisfactory economic returns.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
21.     The draft Amending Loan Agreement between Fiji and the Bank and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed increase in the amount of
the loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
22.     I am satisfied that the increase in the amount of the loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART V - RECOMMENDATION
23.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
increase in the amount of the loan.

Part II on The Project of the President's Report for the First
Highway Project (P-967 dated June 14, 1971) is reproduced.below:
PART III - THE PROJECT
Sectoral Background
13.       Fiji's strategic location on the main sea and air routes which
link Australia and New Zealand with North America have ensured good external
communications. As Fiji is composed of a large number of islands, internal
communications are less satisfactory; many of the islands have rugged
mountainous terrain of volcanic origin and as a result land transport has
been limited mainly to coastal roads. Fijits highway network totals about
1,650 miles, of which only 105 miles of main road and 18 miles of secondary
road are paved. About 1,000 miles of this network are on the main island
of Viti Levu; the principal element is the main road around this island
which includes the link from Suva, the capital and main seaport, and Nadi,
the site of the international airport (see map). This link is currently
served by a narrow, winding gravel road of low standard.
14.       Between 1960 and 1969, Fiji's motor fleet grew at about 9 percent
per annum from about 6,600 to 14,500 vehicles. About half the vehicles are
registered in Suva and its suburbs and about three-quarters of all registered
vehicles are in the area of the road to be reconstructed under this project.
Despite the steady growth in traffic, total annual road expenditures have
remained practically stationary at a level of about US$3.5 million during the
last five years. Annual income from taxes on the import of vehicles and vehicle
supplies and from vehicle license fees not only covered annual maintenance and
administrative costs but also contributed substantially to financing new road
investments. Additional funds were obtained from the United Kingdom in
the form of Development and Welfare grants. The Plan provides for a sharp
increase in highway investment for the period 1971-75 averaging about US$4.6
million per annum, compared with annual investments of US$1.5 million during
the previous five-year period. This increase is due principally to the
expected improvement in the Suva-Nadi road and after its completion in 1976
or 1977 total road expenditures are expected to decline to nearer the current
level. As highway income is expected to increase only modestly during the
Plan period, the Government hopes to obtain additional financing from the
Bank and the United Kingdom.
Project Description
15.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a First Highway Project: Fiji"
(PTR-7i4 has been circulated separately. A Loan and Project Summary is
at Annex II. The genesis of the project goes back to 1965 when the Government



ANNEX III
Page 2 of b
of Fiji asked the United Nations Developrent Programme (UNDP) to finance a
comprehensive survey of its transportation system. The survey, which was
completed in 1968, recommended transportation investmeiits of US$43 million
over a 10-year period, two-thirds of' this amount to be allocated to the
construction of roads including the reconstruc-tion of the Suva-Nadi highway.
A British consulting firm, Rendel, Palmer and Tritton (RPT), prepared the
feasibility study for the road and completed the detailed engineering in
December 1970.  The Bank appraisal mission which visited Fiji in August 1970
recommended that the Bank help to finance the two end sections of the road,
the 4l-mile link between Korotogo and Nadi, including the 1½ mile Nadi bypass,
and the 26-mile lirn between Suva and Deuba, but that construction of the
63-mile central section be deferred until such time as traffic levels had
increased sufficiently to justify the inrestment.  A-t Suva, additional
facilities for traffic distribution between the pro-ect road and the city
will be required by 1980. A Government-financed land use transportation
study of the Suva region is being undertaken by consultants and the
Government has agreed to take steps in consultation with the Bank to
provide facilities for the distribution of traffic f'rom the project road
into Suva. The combined capacIty of these facilities will be adequate
for the forecast traffic until after 1990.
16.       The 26-mile Suva-Deuba section of the project road passes through
high rainfall areas where catt:Le are raised and timber is produced. There
is high potential for tourism development in Deuba, where an eqansion of
tourism facilities is already underway. The Ll-mile section of the project
road between Nadi and Korotogo, traverses a major sugar cane produci4ng area.
It will connect the Sigatoka Valley, which has good possibilities Lor
increased vegetable production, with Nadi and the northwest, and will also
link the international airport at Nadli with Natadola  Harbor which is only
30 miles away and is considered to have the greatest potential for tourism
development in Viti Levu.  The alignment of the two sections of the highway
has been designed to preserve as far as possible beach and scenic areas whfich
are particularly promising for future tourism development.
1,7'.     The total cost of the project incladirng consultarts services for design
and supervision is estimated to be U;S$16.6 million, including a foreign exchange
component of about US$11.8 mr;illion, which represents about 70 percent of the total
project cost and would be covered b y the proposed loan.  The Government would
provide the local currency cos-ts of the project f'rom funds earmarked for this
purpose in its development budget.   Tne cost estimates f'or road construction
we- e prepared by RFT on the basis of completed de'ailed engineering and include
suitable contingency allowances to cover variations in the physical quantities
of construction and price escalation.   A further 10 percent allowance has been
added in niew of the fact that there is no history of major road contracts
in Fiji on w'nich to base project cost estimates.  If the bid evaluations show
that this provision is unnecessary, the corresponding amount of the Bank loan
(UJSt800,000) would be cancelled.  The proposed loan would provide US$600,000
ior retroactive fiinancirg of the foreign exchange costs of detailed engineering
of the Suva-Nadi highway incurred between November 1969 and December 1970.



ANNEX III
Page 3 of 4
18.       The Ministry of Communications, Works and Tourism (MC.WT), the
Government department which would administer this project, is responsible
for all public works, post and telecommunicatior. tourism, marine transport-
ation and aviation in Fiji.  These functions are assigned to three Secretariats,
with the Secretary for Works being responsible for all public works including
public roads. Road planning, design, materials testing and general control
of equipment and construction operations are handled at the headquarters through
the Undersecretary for Engineering, while road maintenance is controLlad by
three District Engineers who report to the Deputy Secretary for Works. Given
the small size of the country and the correspondingly low volume of public
works there is no need for the creation of a separate public works department.
MCWT is a fairly efficient organization and, with the assistance of supervision
consultants provided for under the project, would be able to administer the
project effectively.  MCWT does require some assistance in transportation
planning and the techniques of project evaluation. At the request of the Govern-
ment, the Commonwealth Secretariat has agreed to provide grant assistance for
the services of a transportation economist who would advice MCWT on the methods
of determining the priority, size and timing of future investments in the
trqnsportation sector. The Government has undertaken to consult with the Bank
on the appointment to this position, which is expected to be made shortly.
19.       MCWTT's record of maintaining the highway network has been good;
excellent central workshops located in Suva have full maintenance and overhaul
facilities for the MCWT fleet and district and subdistrict workshops are
adequately equipped and staffed for routine maintenance and repair works. The
maintenance performance is particularly creditable, when the difficult
conditions in Fiji are taken into account. These include a wide range of
rainfall, patterns, scarcity of suitable gravels at marny locations, mountain-
ous terrain where difficult soil conditions are encountered and relatively
high traffic volumes operating over gravel surfaces. Per mile expenditure
on maintenance is therefore high: about F$930 (US$670/km) in 1965 and
F$745 (US$540/km) in 1969. While part of the recent decline in per mile
maintenance expenditure is due to a growing proportion of sealed roads in
the network, the Government has become concerned about the downward trend
and has included increased funds for this pu:pose in the 1971-75 Plan and
given assurances that it would provide sufficient funds to ensure adequate
maintenance of its highway network.    MCWT has recently initiated efforts to
improve planning of future maintenance activities. Particular attention is
being given to improving methods for determining actual costs of different
maintenance operations and preparing a road inventory to which such costs could
be linked. The Government has given assurances that it would continue efforts
to improve road maintenance planning and employ consultants for specialized
assistance after consultation with the Bank should this prove necessary.
20.       The Government has provided assurances that timely action would
be taken to acquire the land required for project construction. The
Constitution (Statutory Amendments) Order 1970 provided new procedures for
Government acquisition of land required for public purposes. The Government
initiated steps in January 1971 to acquire the land required for the project
and has made excellent progress during the last four months. As of May 1, 1971,
the Government had secured the signature of consent agreements providing
assured title to 88 percent of the required land on the Nadi-Kototogo section
and 77 percent on the Suva-Deuba section, with agreement in principle reached
for an additional 13 percent of the land required for this latter section.



ANNEX III
Page 4 of 4
While there remain one or two cases involving small amounts of land which may
have to be resolved in court, acquisition of the remaining land required for
the project is not expected to cause any delay in project construction.
21.       The two sections of' the project road lend themselves to separate
construction contracts, which would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding. It is expected that they would be won by foreign
contractors, since there are no local contractors capable of undertaking
work of this nature. Contracts for a 36-month period could be awarded during,
the f'ourth quarter of calendar 1971 and a further 12-month period should be
sufficient for final paymentsI to be made and claims resolved.
22.       The project has high priority and would provide considerable direct
and indirect benefits to the economy.   The main direct quantifiabl'e benefits
would result from vehicle operating cost savings and on this basis the ovor31l.
economic rate of return of the project is estimated to be about 18 percent     e
a 20-year period: 17 percent for the Suva-Deuba section and 19 percent f-m-  t.
Nadi-Korotogo section.   Sensitivity analyses indicate that the project remai;IS
economically justified over arny likely range of variations in construction
costs, traffic growth and vehicle operating costs.   The indirect benefits o"
the project to the tourism and agriculture sectors would also be conriderable,
though these have not been quantified.   The construction of the project road is
expected to encourage a substantial increase in hotel investment which has
in the past been constrained by the lack of good road connections. The
construction of the project road would also contribute to increased agricultutral
production by providing farmers, particularly in the Sigatoka Valley, with
improved access to major market areas.
