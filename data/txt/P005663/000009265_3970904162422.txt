I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     This report appraises a project designed to provide financial
sssistance to Tunisia's export industries and provide institutional support to
an Export-credit Insurance Company, an Export Promotion Fund, and three
development banks. It also aims at bringing about improvements in the
administrative procedures related to exports. This project was prepared by
Bank missions in 1983 and 1984 in response to the Government's desire to give
increased emphasis to exports of manufactured products.
1.02     The proposed Bank loan of $50.0 million would be made to the
Government of Tunisia which would pass on the proceeds to the three
development banks which would utilise the proceeds of the loan to finance
eligible export projects in the industrial sector. This amount would be
distributed over the three banks as follows:
- Banque de Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET); US$ 20.0
million;
-  Banque Tuniso-Koweitienne de Developpement (BTKD):  US$ 15.0 million;
-  Societe Tuniso-S&oudienne d'Investissement et de Dgveloppement
(STUSID): US$ 15.0 million.

II. THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
Structure and Performance
2.01     Manufacturing industry in Tunisia has been a relatively fast-growing
sector of the economy: in real terms the sector grew by 7.4 percent per annum
in the 1960's and by an average annual growth rate of 11.5 percent in the
1970's. Growth was adversely affected by the poor economic performance of
1982, reflecting the slowdown in the production of food processing industries,
due to weak agricultural output, technical delays in the operation of some
manufacturing units, notably chemicals and cement, and the general slowdown of
the world economy, particulary in Europe. Growth resumed, however, in 1983 to
an annual growth rate of 12% in real terms, bringing the average for 1980-1983
to 7.3%.
2.02     Growth of the manufacturing sector during the 1970's was one of the
main sources of growth of GDP which grew in real terms at an average rate of
7.5% per annum for the entire decade. GDP growth slowed down in the last
three years to an average of 4.3% but this compares favorably with the growth
rates experienced in the other Middle-East and North African countries which
averaged less than 2Z. Consequently, the share of the manufacturing sector in
GDP increased from an average of 7.5 percent in the 1960's to 10.0 percent in
the 1970's and to 14.2 percent in the 1980-1983 period, as can be seen in more
detail from the following table:

2.03     Tunisia's manufacturing sector is well diversified.  Until 1981 food
processing remained the most important sub-sector, contributing 25.5% to
manufacturing value-added. In 1982, the textile sector became the largest
sub-sector mainly because of climatic problems in agriculture. The fastest
growing sub-sectors in the period 1971-1981 have been construction materials
(18.9% average growth in real terms), miscellaneous industries (14.0%),
textiles (14%) and electro-mechanical industries (12.8Z). The table below
shows the changing structure of the manufacturing sector since 1971 as a
result of these developments;

2.04     In 1980-83, Tunisia has maintained a high investment level of over
30% of GDP. Investments in manufacturing industry, which constituted 11.7% of
total investments in 1971, increased constantly reaching 19.7% of total
investments in 1983, as can be seen below:

2.05     The public sector has traditionally been a dominant force in the
sector with an average of 55% of total investments and has concentrated its
investments in chemicals (fertilizers), construction materials (cement) and
agro-industries (sugar). Public sector investments are generally capital
intensive and have high incremental capital-output ratios. Whereas 45.3Z of
total investments in 1980-1983 were in construction materials and chemicals
(the two sub-sectors where the public sector dominates) their contribution to
manufacturing value-added was only 25.3%. In contrast, the two sub-sectors
dominated by the private sector (textiles and miscellaneous industries)
accounted for only 19.4% of total investments but contributed 36.8% to total
manufacturing value-added during this period. The table below shows
investments and value-added in manufacturing by the public and private sector

2.06     Employment creation has been one of the main objectives of industrial
policy.  Between 1975 and 1980 over 30% of total new employment (equivalent to
65,000 jobs) was created in manufacturing industries and the share of
employment in manufacturing industries in total employment increased from
17.2Z to 19.1Z. However the 5% annual increase in employment in manufacturing
industries remained well below the increase in capital stock in the sector
which averaged around 10% per annum during the period 1975-81. The average
investment per worker increased from about TD 4,300 in the mid-1970's to TD
6,000 at the end of the 1970's. This higher investment cost was to a large
extent due to the very large investments in the chemical and construction
industries.
Constraints in the Manufacturing Sector
2.07     A significant part of Tunisian industries have developed with import
restrictions, price controls, investment licensing and direct subsidies.
These measures, which were initially justified for infant industry reasons,
have, over time, developed into a system that does not encourage efficiency,
productivity and optimal use of installed capacity. This can be seen from the
results of the fir.t part of a Bank-financed study under the EMI Project (Loan
2113-TUN) on the protection system, related to the mechanical and electrical
industry, which shows that industries with the highest level of protection,
serving the domestic market, have the lowest economic and financial rates of
return. The same study shows that public enterprises have generally
benefitted from the highest levels of protection while showing the lowest
rates of return:

The Effective Protection Study is being carried out for several other sectors
(chemicals, textiles, footwear, construction materials), and further results
are expected to be available during the course of 1985. As is illustrated in
the above preliminary results, domestic-based industries are clearly
significantly less efficient than exporting ones. A rationalisation of the
protection system is thus likLely to be an important policy tool for further
encouraging the growth of exports. The whole issue of the protection system
is now under study and is expected to be addressed in 1985-1986 (para 2.09).
2.08     There are other reasons that account for the low productivity of
Tunisian industry. First, wage increases of 232 on average in 1982, and 162
in 1983, have been substantially higher than productivity increases. Together
with relatively high social security contributions by employers, the high
effective cost of labor is an obstacle to employment creation, particularly if
combined with relatively low interest rates. The increase in wages, and its
resulting effect on costs and the general price level, has led to restrictions
on imports and tightening of price controls in 1983. An Employment Study is
presently being carried out with a view to recomend appropriate income and
other employment oriented policies. Second, the limited domestic market has
meant that for many industries, economies of scale could not be fully
exploited. A re-orientation of some of these industries towards exports
should help overcome some of the above constraints.
Bank role in the Manufacturing Sector
2.09     The dialogue between Tunisia and the Bank on industrial development
has been a productive and multifaceted one. It has aimed at addressing the
major contraints noted above. Reference was made in para. 2.07 to a study
financed by the Bank to assess effective protection and its effect on
industrial efficiency. The results of this study will be used by the Bank in
its continuing dialogue with the Tunisian authorities to adopt policies more
conducive to improving industrial efficiency. In this connection, a high
level Bank mission is planned for early 1985 with a view to make
recommendations on improving pricing policies, reducing tariffs and



quantitative restrictions, and reorienting public enterprises towards higher
productivity and efficiency. The mission will also rely on the results of the
employment study as well as the recently completed review of the Financial
Sector which is scheduled for discussion with the Tunisian authorities in
early 1985 (see para 4.10).
2.10     Through its loans to industry, the Bank aimed at promoting industrial
decentralization, labor-intensive industries and financing high priority
industries (e.g. EMIs and SSIs) in support of the Government's priorities for
industrial development. Bank financing of manufacturing in Tunisia has mostly
tonsisted of loans prc ided through BDET which received eight Bank loans
totalling $129.2 million (net of cancellations), of which $14.48 million
remained undisbursed as of December 31, 1984. Most of these funds financed
manufacturing industries. In addition, Bank loans have helped meet BDET's
resource requirements while assisting it in strengthening its organization and
in improving its performance. Through its representative on BDET's Board, IFC
has offered a substantial contribution in this regard. The Project
Performance Audit Report of September 1981 on loans Nos. 648-TUN, 798-TUN and
881-TUN, covering the third (1969), fourth (1972) and fifth (1973) loans to
BDET, concluded that considerable progress had been made in terms of
institution building and management performance, and that these loans have
contributed to changing BDET's role from a supplier of equity funds for public
sector industries, to that of financier and advisor of private investors.
However, BDET's promotion and supervision capacity, and its evaluation of
physical and financial contingencies of projects needed strengthening. The
seventh loan to BDET (Loan 1504-TUN of 1978) addressed some of these issues,
and included a credit line for a pilot Small-Scale Industries (SSI) scheme
(Loan 1505-TUN of 1978) which prepared the ground for a $30 million loan to
SSI through commercial banks and BDET as intermediaries (Loan 1969-TUN of
1981). The last operation with BDET was Loan 2113-TUN in March 1982 for the
financing of Electro-Mechanical Industries. The present project will continue
to build upon the last three projects in addressing some of the shortcomings
noted in the Project Performance Audit Report.
2.11     The Bank loans have strengthened the leading role that BDET has
played, and should continue to play, in the development of medium and
small-scale manufacturing industries in Tunisia. The proposed project would
represent a continuation of Bank support for Tunisia's industrial
development. It would establish credit lines for supporting export generating
investments, assist in the establishment of an Export Promotion Fund and help
simplify the administrative procedures for exporting. The project would
provide further support to BDET and initiate Bank cooperation with two other
development banks the Banque Tuniso-Koweitienne de Developpement (BTKD), the
Societe Tunisienne SEoudienne d'Investissement et de Developpement (STUSID) as
well as with the newly established Export-Credit Insurance Company (COTUNACE).



III. THE EXPORT SECTOR
_ Structure and Performance
3.01     In the 1960's industrial development consisted mainly of developing
import substitution industries and the public sector was dominant. In the
early 1970's, partly in order to overcome the constraints imposed by the small
market of six million people, the Government shifted this policy at the same
time that the private sector was accorded a more important role. Thus, the
Government put greater emphasis on developing export-oriented industries which
was reflected in L2'# 72-38, enacted in 1972, which gave important tax, customs
and foreign exchange incentives to exports (para 3.10). As a result,
manufactured exports increased by an average rate of 14.4% in real terms from
1971 to 1981 (13.6% between 1976 and 1983), leading to a more than four-fold
increase in their real value between 1971 and 1983 (from TD 120.0 million to
TD 526.4 million). This was substantially faster than the increase in
manufacturing value added which increased by 11.5% in the period 1971-1981
(8.4% between 1976 and 1983). At the same time, exports of manufactured
products accounted for an increasing share of these products in total exports:
manufactured exports (excluding processed food) rose from 32% of non-petroleum
exports in 1971 to 79.3% in 1983, as can be seen from the table below:

world exports of these products (14.9%) in the period 1976-1981. Tunisia's
export performance also compared favorably with that of the mediterranean
region where exports grew by an average rate of 17.8% per year 1/.

3.02     During the 1970's the composition of Tunisia's expo.ts changed
substantially. In 1970, 95% of its exports consisted of processed and
unprocessed phosphates, foodstuffs and petroleum products. Ihis percentage
had fallen to 55% by 1983; and wherea3 52.9% of all manufactured exports
consisted of processed foods in 1971, this share fell to below 13.5Z in 1983.
On the other hand, textiles and leather increased their share from less than
6% in 1971 to almost 40% in 1981. Over the same period, chemicals almost
doubled its share in total manufactured exports to almost one-third of
manufactured exports by 1983. Exports of electro-mechanical industries also
grew substantially in the second half of the seventies and now represent 9.5%
of total exports. The table below shows the changes in the composition of
Tunisia's exports between 1971 and 1983:

3.03     Tunisia's exports are increasingly oriented to markets of
industrialized countries. Exports to the United States, negligible in 1970,
represented 21 percent of total exports in 1983. The relative importance of
Tunisia's two traditional partners, France and Italy, decreased slightly, from
45 percent in 1970 to 38 percent in 1983, but the overall importanCe of
exports sold to the EEC remained about the same, fluctuating between 55 and 60
percent. On the other hand, there was a striking decline in exports to
Tunisia's closes neighbours, Libya, Algeria and Morocco. These three
countries were absorbing between 10 and 14 percent of exports at the beginning
of the 70's but only 3% in 1983. Although exports to Arab countries of the
Middle East increased over the period, their importance remains very marginal
(1.2 percent in 1983).
Plan Objectives and Strategy
3.04     The Sixth Five-Year Plan's (1982-86) main objectives are to ease the
growing unemployment problem, to reduce inter-regional income disparities and
to maintain the country's long-term social stability and credit-worthiness at
a time of growing financial and balance of payments constraints caused by the
expected decline in petroleum exports. To achieve these objectives the Plan
foresees the need to slow down substantially the growth of private consumption
and reduce the high investment rate which was inceasingly financed by foreign
savings in the last few years.



- 9 -
3.05     Increased exports of manufactured products are, in the Plan scenario,
essential to achieve these objectives. The Plan projects exports to continue
to grow at an average rate of 15% per year in real terms. Export-led growth
would relieve the pressure on the balance of payments and foster higher growth
for the economy. Equally important, export industries are generally
relatively labor intensive. In the longer term, traditional exports, such as
phosphates-based chemicals and agricultural products, can offer only modest
growth prospects. The growth of non-traditional manufactured exports should
therefcre become one of the principal instruments for stimulating the growth
of the economy and alleviating the balance of payments constraint as well as
for creating employment.
3.06     In addition to the well established main export sectors such as
textiles and agriculture, which need to be further developed, electrical and
mechanical industries are planned to become an important source of new
exports. Tunisia has a well trained labor force, whose wages are still well
below European levels; it has liberal investment policies with regard to
foreign and private investments, is close to Europe and the Arab countries,
and has preferential access to the EEC market. This gives the country a
comparative advantage in the production of capital, intermediate and consumer
goods, in those sub-sectors using labor-intensive and simple or intermediate
technologies, where economies of scale are possible at low levels of
production.
Recent Developments
3.07     During the first two years of the Sixth Plan (1982-86) budgetary and
balavce of payments conditions deteriorated sharply, due mainly to a sharp
rise in wages, increases in subsidies and budgetary transfers, and increases
in the trade deficit. Even though the relative magnitude of the
deterioration, as mevsured in relation to GDP, is not as severe as at the
start of the last Plan (1977), there is cause for some concern since, contrary
to previous years, the contribution of the petroleum sector to the economy is
declining and future petroleum price movements are unlikely to restore the
favorable financial position which Tunisia enjoyed during the last decade.
3.08     In 1982-83 the drought-related decline in agricultural production as
well as the slowdown in external demand for exports and tourism induced the
sluggish growth of output. The real growth of output which stagnated in 1982,
showed a 4.5 percent growth in 1983. Demand continued to expand rather
strongly in 1982-83. Investment exceeded 30 percent of GDP compared to the
plan's average target figure of 27 percent. At the same time, the growth of
consumption, triggered mainly by the wage increases of the last two years,
surpassed the growth of GDP, thus reducing the domestic saving rate from
nearly 24 per cent of GDP in 1981 to 20 percent in 1983. The strong pressure
of demand translated itself into the unprecendently high inflation rate of
13.6 percent in 1982. Inflation decelerated to about 9 percent in 1983,
following the intensification of price controls.
3.09     The current account deficit of the balance of payments also
deteriorated in 1981-83. This was due mainly to the decline in net petroleum
earnings and an increase in imports. Thus, the current account deficit
increased from 7.6 percent of GDP in 1981 to 9.4 percent in 1982. Following



- 10 -
the tightening of import controls in 1983, the current account deficit
declined slightly to about 8.8 percent of GDP. These emerging external
constraints and Tunisia's inceasing debt burden show the importance of
fostering export growth, including, in particular, the growth of manufactured
exports.
Fiscal and Financial Incentives
3.10     In 1972, when the Government's policy changed from one of import
substitution to export promotion, a law (Law 72-38) was passed offering
attractive incentives to investors who wanted to take advantage of Tunisia's
skilled and relatively cheap labor force, its closeness to Western Europe and
the well developed industrial infrastructure aLready in place. The law
provided the opportunity to establish "off-shore" companies, anywhere in
Tunisia, which would not be subject to customs, foreign exchange and fiscal
regulations applicable to other companies. The law gives these companies a
ten-year corporate tax exemption and reduced rates thereafter, reimbursement
of taxes paid on locally procured goods and services, exoneration of all
import duties, exoneration of taxes on rented property and reduced rates of
registration taxes and on distributed profits. With regards to foreign
exchange regulations the law distinguishes "resident" and "non-resident"
companies. The latter companies (owned for more than 66% by non-residents)
are essentially exempt from all foreign exchange controls but have to execute
all their transactions in dinars bought with foreign exchange while resident
companies have to repatriate all their foreign exchange earnings. The
Investment Promotion Agency (API), created by the same law, advises the
Ministry of National Economy to issue the licence, qualifying a company as a
resident or non-resident company under the law. Since its passage in 1972,
more than 1,050 projects have been approved, including 99 projects in 1983 (58
resident and 41 non-resident). The Law has fostered employment (over 30,000
in 1981) and had a substantial impact on increased exports. However,
exporters failed to use more intensively local supplies and the effect has
been that there have been insufficient linkages between the export and
domestic sectors. It seems that low quality, high price and unreliability of
delivery dates are more important obstacles to closer integration of the two
sectors than the unwillingness on the part of exporters to use local supplies.
3.11     Aware of the problem of insufficient integration of the export and
domestic sectors, the Tunisian authorities passed a second law in 1981 (Law
81-56, as amended in 1983) which gives important advantages to domestic or
"non off-shore" companies that export only part of their production and are
certified by API. The main advantages for such exporters are the following:
(i) a reduced corporate tax of 20% on the part of the production which is
exported; (ii) exemption from sales taxes on goods and services bought on the
local market and used in the production of exports; and (iii) access to
simpler formalities for imports required in the production of exports. This
law is recent and it is premature to assess its effect in fostering exports
l/. Nevertheless, it is clear that adminstrative procedures related to

exporters also have access to credits at the rate of 6.5% per annum to
finance their operations .pre-financing) and accounts receivable.
Commercial banks providing these credits have access to a preferential
discount rate of 4.75% per annum without ceiling or prior approval of the
Central Bank.



- 11 -
exports remain complex and uncoordinated and therefore limit the effectiveness
of the incentives provided by the existing laws and regulations. The proposed
project addresses the issue of simplifying export procedures (paras 6.22-6.23).
3.12     Improvements in export finance were also introduced in the last three
years following a continuing Bank dialogue with the Government. As a result,
several constraints in the financing of exports were removed: (i) to avoid
the build-up of stocks of imported raw materials and intermediate inputs, a
limitation had been put on pre-financing these imports to 10% of the annual
import requirements. This was considered too restrictive and sometimes
impeded the uninterrupted production for exports. The Bank recommended that
pre-financing should be available for at least 20% of the annual import
allocation. This recommendation was subsequently implemented; (ii) Tunisian
exporters were limited in their possibility of offering attractive payment
terms on their exports, because banks could only discount claims on abroad of
a maturity of less than 90 days. This was considered too restrictive and the
duration for discounting claims was lengthened to 180 days, to be increased in
exceptional circumstances to 360 days; (iii) Tunisian exporters could only
keep 3% of their foreign exchange earnings in convertible dinars. This often
left exporters with insufficient funds for their marketing and promotion
efforts. Recently, the percentage was increased to 4% and exporters are
allowed an additional TD 6,000 per year for travel expenditures. This is a
step in the right direction but may nevertheless not provide sufficient
foreign exchange to allow exporters to explore new markets and, particularly,
market new products. Also, and more importantly, it does not cover new
exporters which need foreign exchange to market their products abroad. To
overcome this problem, the project provides for the setting up of an Export
Promotion Fund (paras 6.13-6.17).
Institutional Framework
3.13     The Center for the Promotion of Exports (CEPEX), a public
organization of industrial and commercial character under the aegis of the
Ministry of National Economy, was established by Law 73-20 of April 14, 1973
to contribute to the development of Tunisian exports and to assist exporters
by conducting market surveys, providing marketing advice, disseminating
commercial information, participating in trade fairs and helping the
Government with the formulation of trade policies. CEPEX received financial
assistance from the Bank through the Technical Assistance Loan (2197-TUN)
which includes a study which has as one of its main objectives to determine
how to strengthen the institutions responsible for export promotion and to
identify projects and sectors that have export potential. These projects may
be financed by the proposed project. The study is underway and is expected to
be completed in early 1985.
3.'4     Institutional improvements were also introduced by two new laws
passe' in 1984.  The most important of these was the approval by Parliament in
May 1984 of a law creating an Export-Credit Insurance Company (COTUNACE).  The
company was estatYlished in September 1984 (see paras 5.48 to 5.50 for further
details). The need to establish an export-credit insurance facility was
identified by the Tunisian Government and the Bank during missions in 1982 and
1983. The creation of such a facility would complement the favorable credit
conditions offered to exporters in the form of export credits at the rate of



- 12 -
6.5% p.a. The objective of export-credit insurance is to cover, through an
insurance policy, the majority of losses which an entrepreneur can incur on
its export operations because of non-payment by the foreign buyer for
commercial or political reasons. Such insurance should eucourage banks to
provide loans to exporters with limited collateral. Through the proposed
project, the Bank will be closely associated with COTUNACE with a view to
monitor its continued sound development. The second law provides for the
creation of Export Trading Companies which would benefit from substantial tax,
customs duty and foreign exchange facilities. These companies would
specialise in selling Tunisian products abroad, especially the products of
small- and mediumrsize industries that would otherwise find it difficult to
find markets abroad.  Licenses for establishing such companies will be issued
by the Ministry of National Economy on the recommendation of CEPEX.
Conclusion
3.15     The previous sections have outlined the important measures undertaken
by the Tunisian authorities in recent years to strengthen fiscal and financial
incentives to exporters, simplify administrative procedures and set up and
strengthen institutions to foster export growth. Several of these measures
were taken in the context of the continuing dialogue between the Bank and the
Government of Tunisia and the proposed project builds up on and continues to
support many of these initiatives. At the same time, it was pointed out in
Chapter II (para 2.07) that the protection framework encouraged inefficiencies
and production for the domestic market rather than for exports. The Tunisian
Government is aware of this situation and is in the process of undertaking an
in-depth study of the protection framework. The results of this work will be
reviewed with a Bank industrial sector mission during 1985 and this is
expected to initiate a dialogue with the Tunisian authorities on how best to
rationalise the protection system in the coming years focusing on pricing,
investment licensing and tariffs and quantitative restrictions. At the same
time, Tuniria's record of export growth in recent years, and the priority
accorded to exports in the current Five Year Plan, as well as the availability
of a substantial pipeline of viable export projects and the need to further
strengthen export institutions, argues in favor of a project that will support
the Government's efforts in this critical area at this time.

IV. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR
Overview
4.01     Tunisia's financial system consists of the monetary system, other
financial institutions and the stock and bond exchange. The monetary system
consists of the Central Bank, ten commercial banks and the postal check
system. The other financial institutions consist of eight operating
development banks, two savings organizations, eight portfolio management
companies, eight off-shore banks and five foreign bank representative
offices. For the size of the country (seven million inhabitants) and its
level of development this is a fairly large institutional framework. In
addition, Tunisia has a stock and bond exchange which is not highly developed
on which essentially ten-year bonds issued or guaranteed by the Government are
traded as well as shares of 44 companies of which nine are banks. The
Government is shareholder in 39 of the 44 companies and majority owner in 26
of them.
4.02     The commercial banks, which are essentially deposit-retail banks, are
small by international standards. Tie largest bank, Societe Tunisienne de
Banque with a share capital of TD 20 million (US $27.6 million) had total
assets of just over TD 1.0 billion (US tl.38 billion) at the end of 1982. At
that time the total assets of the ten commercial banks did not exceed TD 3.6
billion (US $5 billion). Besides short-term credits, commercial banks can
also provide medium-term loans up to a maximum of seven years within limits
set by the Central Bank. Loans over seven years can only be provided by
commercial banks from special resources (i.e. non-deposits) which have a
maturity of more than seven years. However, credits over seven years can be
authorised for public enterprises from regular commercial bank resources as
long as these credits do not exceed 3% of total deposits of the bank in
question.
4.03     The commercial banks are subject to the monetary policy of the
Central Bank, its credit controls and particularly the requirement that
commerciaL banks invest 43% of their deposits and savings accounts in
Government paper (20%), National Home Savings Company (CNEL) bonds (5%) and
medium-term loans to industry (18%). This requirement has made the commercial
banks important sources for industrial medium-term finance.
4.04     Up to 1980 there were only two development banks:  Banque de
D6veloppement Economique de Tunisie (BDET) and Banque Nationale de
Developpement Touristique (BNDT) which essentially were the only institutions
specialized in medium and long-term financing of industry and tourism.
Between 1981 and 1983, six new development banks were created. Four of the
newly-created development banks were joint-ventures between Tunisia and other
Arab countries: the Tuniso-Koweiti Development Bank (BTKD), the Tuniso-Saudi
Investment and Development Company (STUSID), the Tunisian and Emirates
Investment Bank (BTEI), and the Tuniso-Qatary Investment Bank (BTQI) 1/. In
1/ The other two were the Banque Nationale de Developpement Agricole which
finances only projects in the agricultural sector and Banque de
Cooperation du Maghreb Arabe which finances only Algerian-Tunisian
joint-ventures. Other banking joint ventures are being considered with
Libya, Senegal and Italy.



- 14 -
comparison with the commercial banks they have relatively large share capitals
(BTKD and STUSID: TD 100 million each; BTEI: TD 50 million; and BTQI: TD 70
million) which have been subscribed equally by Tunisia and the respective Arab
countries. A main reason for their creation was to attract capital resources
from abroad and to channel these resources into productive uses on the basis
of financial, economic and technical criteria generally used by development
banks.
The financing of exports
4.05     (a) Short-term credit.  The financing of export and import
transactions is strictly controlled by the Central Bank. Exporters are
required to repatriate the proceeds of their exports and are allowed a maximum
amount (4% of the proceeds) in convertible dinars to pay for incidental
expenditures related to their export business. On the basis of agreed import
allocations, which have been liberalised progressively, co;amercial banks
provide pre-financing credit for imported goods and services required by the
prospective exporter. These credits, as well as those to finance claims
originating from actual exports, are subject to favorable interest rates
(6.5%), unlimited rediscount facility (at 4.75%) and are not subject to prior
approval for rediscounting. In future COTUNACE will insure these credits:
this will be a significant improvement since credit was often limited by the
insufficient collateral of exporters.
4.06     (b) Medium- and long-term credit.  Medium-term export credit is
provided by the Central Bank through the commercial banks on a case-by-case
basis and is tailored to the particular needs of the very few manufacturers
who export capital equipment (transformers, railway wagons, metal structures
etc.). A medium-term export-credit scheme to finance exports of capital goods
is under study. Mediur-term credit (up to seven years) to exporters for
investment purposes is available from the commercial banks to a limited
extent. However, given their relatively small size and their limited project
appraisal capacity tailored principally to smaller projects, commercial banks
generally provide mediumrterm finance only in conjunction with long-term
credits from the development banks. Commercial banks can only provide
long-term credit from long-term resources specifically mobilised for that
purpose. Unless these resources have particularly attractive features, for
example risk sharing by the Government and provision of low cost resources
under the FOPRODI schemes 1/, commercial banks have little incentive to
provide long-term finance.  Thus commercial banks are principally providers of
short-term and medium-term credit which they finance from their short-term and
mediumrterm deposits. Long-term lending to industry is essentially provided
by the development banks which have been created for this purpose and which
have been equiped with organisations and staff to appraise, supervise and
promote industrial ventures in all industrial sub-sectors. In 1983-84
development banks financed roughly 60% of MLT credit with 40% coming from
commercial banks. In prior years, before the formatioa of the new development
banks, commercial banks provided significantly more MLT financing (about 70%
of the total in 1981-82).

Interest Rates
4.07     Tunisia has a very detailed structure of interest rates which is
regulated by the Central Bank. This structure determines all the discount
rates of the Central Bank for short and mediunrterm paper. There are
different discount rates according to the sector (industry, agriculture,
housing, tourism etc.) and purpose (construction, seasonal credit, loans for
medium and small-size industry, loans for under-developed regions of the
country, exports etc.). Interest rates or loans by commercial banks are also
fixed at levels that depend on whether they are discountable or not, the rate
of discount as well as the maturity of the loan, the sector and the purpose.
Thus for mediumr-term loans (maximum of seven years) to industry for investment
purposes, the interest rate is set at between 9.5% (minimum) and 9.75%
(maximum) for rediscountable loans and between 10.0% (minimum) and 10.25%
(maximum) for non-discountable loans. Development banks are free to determine
their own interest rates on long-term loans, which are presently at around
12%. However, for loans below TD 500,000, BDET charges 11.0% in order to
remain competitive with the terms on medium-term loans offered by commercial
banks. The other development banks do not generally make loans below TD
500,000. The rates of 11-12% on MLT credit compare with an inflation of 9X in
1983. The inflation rate is expected to be 9% through project implemen-
tation. Thus local rates are, and are expected to remain over the life of an
individual loan, positive in real terms.
4.08     Interest rates on deposits (both sight and term) and savings accounts
are also fixed by the Central Bank with rates changing according to maturity
(i.e. longer maturities having higher rates), the nature of the saver
(individual or corporation), the size of the deposit (small savers have
special rates) and purpose (e.g., savings for housing). Typically, term
deposits over two years pay 7.75% (after tax) and savings accounts of the same
maturity pay 8.75%.
4.09     Periodically the Central Bank revises the general level of the
interest rate structure; the last such adjustment took place in April 1981
when interest rates were increased by about 1.5%. This increase was in
response to the general rise in interest rates abroad and the experienced
inflation rate in the country. The development banks have no access to the
rediscount facility of the Central Bank. However, BDET has access to a
special facility of TD 8.6 million at 9% (the normal discount rate for
mediumrterm loans for industry by commercial banks is 71).
Review of The Financial Sector
4.10     A Financial Sector Study (FSS) is currently in progress.  It reviews
overall monetary and credit policies, the institutional framework and the
utilisation of monetary instruments, particularly interest rates, to achieve
better mobilisation and more efficient allocation of resources. The FSS
concluded that the Tunisian financial sector is basically efficient but can
benefit from some adjustments to improve the country's resource and
mobilisation efforts and the efficiency of the intermediation process. The
FSS proposes an overall upward adjustment in the structure of interest rates
together with a simplification and harmonisation of the overly complex
existing schedule. While on-lending rates have been positive in real terms,



- 16 -
deposits have been barely positive in recent years and well below
international levels. It also proposes the introduction of a more flexible
system to allow rates to be adjusted more frequently to changes in the
liquidity situation, the domestic inflation rate and interest rates abroad.
Finally, it proposes that subborrowers bear a share of the foreign-exchange
risk on foreign currency loans. Two aspects of the FSS's general
recommendations are of relevance to the proposed project and these are
discussed in more detail below. More generally, the recommendations of the
FSS are relevant to improving the efficiency of the intermediation process in
Tunisia and domestic resource mobilisation and allocation. The findings of
the financial sector report will be discussed with the Tunisian authorities
beginning during 1985 and this will provide the basis for continuing the
Bank-Tunisian dialogue on the reform of the financial sector.
4.11     Cost of funds of development and commercial banks. There is a large
discrepancy in the cost of funds and lending rates between the commercial
banks and the development banks, which is undesirable. The relatively low
interest rates on deposits at commercial banks has kept the average cost of
funds for these banks at about 6%, taking into account that sight deposits,
which constitute between 55% and 60% of banks' resources, are remunerated at
the rate of 1% for enterprises and 2% for individuals. Development banks on
the other hand are not allowed to accept deposits and are therefore
essentially dependent on the international market or lines of credits from
bilateral or multilateral agencies. In particular BDET, which raised $60
million in 1983 from the international market, has seen its average cost of
borrowing increase to about 8.5% in 1983, while the marginal cost of borrowing
increased to over 11%. This rate has since come down to about 10%.
Commercial banks make mediumr-term loans to industry at the rate of 9.5% - 10%,
which allows them a financial spread of 3.5% - 4%. The average rate on new
loan commitments by BDET is presently about 11.5%. The financial margin on
its portfolio, 1/ which had declined between 1979 and 1982 because of
increases in the cost of borrowing, increased to 2.3% in 1983.  This margin is
forecast to remain at 2% in the future (see para 6.12 and Annex 3, Table 6) in
part because of Government support, which will be phased out, however, at the
end of 1986, and in part because of increased interest rates on lending.
Nevertheless, BDET's relative position vis-a-vis commercial banks can be
strengthened further by upward adjustments in the structure of interest rates
(for both deposit and especially lending rates) as recommended in the FSS in
order to improve overall domestic resource mobilisation and allocation. This
general issue will be pursued in the context of the discussion of the FSS and
our general economic dialogue with the Government. While an upward adjustment
of interest rates will further strengthen the financial position of BDET which
is already and is expected to remain sound, this would only be expected to
have a significant effect on BDET's financial position in the medium term.

4.12     Foreign Exchange Risk.  The Government now carries the foreign
exchange risk on the foreign borrowings of BDET and BNDT. Up to 1981 this
practice resulted in profits for the Government because of the dinar
appreciated in relation to the basket of currencies. Since 1981 the situation
has changed, particularly vis-b-vis the dollar which has appreciated.
Nevertheless, over a period of ten years, the result has still been positive
for the Government. The question of the foreign exchange risk coverage is
becoming more important since the new development banks will need to borrow a
significant part of their resource requirements abroad. An appropriate
foreign exchange coverage scheme should therefore be designed. The FSS has
proposed a new basis for subborrowers to cover foreign exchange risks in
relation to the risk of devaluation of a particular currency. These
principles need to be translated into a detailed scheme. During negotiations
agreement was reached with the Government to undertake a study for instituting
a suitable foreign exchange scheme on the basis of the principles included in
the FSS. The study will be completed and discussed with the Bank by March 31,
1986. This agreement is reflected in the loan documents (Section 4.04 of the
Loan Agreement). The Government will continue to bear the foreign-exchange
risk under the proposed loan as under previous loans to BDET, until agreement
has been reached on an alternative coverage scheme as a result of the study.

V. THE INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
A. Financial Intermediaries
5.01     Three financial institutions, BDET, BTKD and STUSID, will be the
intermediaries for the proposed project. BDST is the country's leading
development bank and has received eight Bank loans since 1966. BTKD and
STUSID, two new development banks, were selected as intermediaries in response
to the Government's request that the Bank project relies on several channels
to support the financing of investments for exports. The inclusion of BTKD
and STUSID in the project will significantly add to the number of viable
export projects. They have given priority to export projects in the past and
the proposed Bank loan has already led them to identify additional viable
export projects. The two institutions are financially viable and well
managed: they have put in place competent organizations and staff to
identify, appraise and supervise projects financed by them. A relation with
the Bank is considered important by BTKD and STUSID because of the
institutional support the Bank can provide in terms of overall development
bank policies and practices and more specifically on appropriate project
appraisal/supervision standards. Financial support by the Bank to these
institutions is also expected to strengthen their ability to raise resources
from international sources. Detailed descriptions and analysis of their
operations, financial position, resource requirements and organizational
structures are provided in paras 5.23 - 5.34 (BTKD) and 5.35 - 5.47 (STUSID)
I.   Banque de Developpement Economigue de Tunisie (BDET)
5.02     BDET was created in 1959 and reorganised, with the assistance of the
Bank Group, in 1966. Since then the Bank has provided eight loans totalling
$134.5 million, representing between 33% and 40% of BDET's total resource
requirements. IFC is a shareholder in BDET since 1966 (see list of
Shareholders, Annex 3, table 1). The institution is well managed, has a
competent staff and has well established procedures for appraisal and
supervision. A number of developments have, however, put strains on its
operations, financial position, profitability, portfolio and staffing.
5.03     Operations.  BDET's approvals almost doubled between 1980 and 1982
(Annex 3, table 2). However in 1983 approvals fell by 35Z mainly for the
following reasons:  (i) investments in the electro-mechanical industries and
tourism sectors returned to more normal levels after the exceptionally high
approval levels of 1981 and 1982 reflecting, in particular, large investments
in the these two sectors; (ii) competition from the new development banks took
away business from BDET; and (iii) demand for financing by SSI 1/ projects
stagnated. Although SSI projects remain BDET's most important activity in
terms of number of projects, the amounts approved for such projects have
decreased in importance in 1982 and 1983. BDET expects approvals to increase
by about 10% in the next three years (see para 5.17). BDET's approvals in the
period 1980-1983 were mainly for new projects (73%) in the private sector
(88%). Its operations were well distributed over the several sectors and
regions of the country (Annex 3, table 3).
1/ Defined since 1980 as enterprises having total investment cost of less
than TD 500,000. The limit is presently under review and may be increased
to TD 750,000.



- 19 -
5.04     Financial Position.  BDET's audited balance sheets for the last five
years are attached in Annex 3, table 4. During the period 1980-1984 assets
increased by an average rate of 21.3Z per year reflecting the general growth
of industrial investments in Tunisia. BDET's share capital was increased from
TD 10 million to TD 20 million in 1982/83, partly by incorporating reserves.
BDET's debt-equity ratio (5:1) on December 31, 1983 remains well below the
maximum allowed under previous Loan Agreements (8:1).
5.05     TWo developments in recent years are worth noting:  First, the
increase in short-term liabilities mainly on account of short-term borrowing.
These short-term borrowings, were required to meet BDET's cash requirements
for loan disbursements at a time when it was difficult and expensive to raise
resources from the capital market.  In 1983, BDET borrowed US$60 million in
the form of Floating Rate Notes (FRN), which enabled it, among others, to
repay about US$ 13.8 million (TD 10 million) of short-term borrowings.
Although the terms of the FRN are attractive by international comparison (1/2X
above LIBOR, 7-years), the cost of the issue increased BDET's overall resource
cost. Borrowing of an additional $60 million on medium-term is planned for
early-1985, which should enable BDET to retire the remainder of its short-term
borrowings, which had increased again in 1984, and thus further improve its
current ratio.
5.06     The second noteworthy development concerns the increase in
receivables, which includes TD 10.5 million due by the Government on account
of foreign exchange losses incurred on borrowing abroad. These losses have
been accumulating since 1981 and concern losses on principal payments only
(Interest payments have been substantially paid by the Government-para 5.08).
During negotiations the Government committed itself to reimburse BDET before
the end of 1985 for outstanding losses on principal incurred up to the end of
1983. A commitment was also obtained from the Government to reimburse BDET
for losses resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 1984 before
the end of 1986. The Government will continue to cover BDET's foreign
exchange risk until such time as the foreign exchange coverage system may be
revised in the light of theresults of the study, referred to in para 4.12.
5.07     Profitabilit.  BDET's audited income statements for the period
1980-1982 (Annex 3, table 5) show almost constant net incomes before tax (of
about TD 1.55 million) despite an increase of over 50X in assets during this
period. The main reason for this development is that the average cost of
borrowings increased faster than interest rates on lending. As a result of
the dialogue provided for in Loan No. 2113-TUN (EMI project), BDET has
increased interest rates on its loans from 9.0% in 1981 to about 11.0% at
present for small and medium size industries, to 12.5Z for tourism projects
and to 132 for large projects. These increases in interest rates have led to
a substantial increase in interest income betweem 1983 and 1984. This was
however counterbalanced by the increased cost of borrowing which was largely
due to the depreciation of the dinar. Part of this increased cost was however
absorbed by the Government compensation for BDET's foreign exchange losses
(para. 5.08). Further interest rate increases by 0.5% per year may be
envisaged, inter alia in the light of the evolution of the financial sector.
The effect of these interest rate increases on income is, however, initially
slow since the proportion of higher interest rate new loans in the total
outstanding portfolio remains small.



- 20 -
5.08     The cost of borrowing has increased mainly because if the increased
debt service on foreign borrowing due to the depreciation of the dinar
particularly vis-h-vis the dollar. Foreign exchange losses on account of
interest payments on foreign borrowing amounted to TD 1.0 million in 1981, TD
1.6 million in 1982 and TD 2.2 million in 1983. The Government has reimbursed
BDET for these losses through its annual compensation payments amounting to TD
1.0 million in 1981, TD 0.5 million in 1982 and TD 2.9 million in 1983.
Including these compensation payments BDET's financial margin (difference
between the average rate of lending and average rate on borrowing) has been
1.27% in 1982, 2.38% in 1983 and 2.00 in 1984, which is substantially in
agreement with the understanding reached during the negotiations for Loan-2113
to assure BDET a margin of 2%. The average return on net worth over the last
six years has been 10.7%, permitting BDET to maintain 8% dividend payments.
BDET has reduced its administrative expenses in the last four years; in 1983
these expenses fell to below 1% of average assets which is one of the lowest
levels of develoment banks financed by the Bank. Reimbursement by the
Government of the foreign exchange losses together with che continued
increases in interest rates on lending will gradually improve BDET's
profitability and permit the phasing out of Government subsidies by 1986 as
agreed under the EMI-project (Loan 2113-TUN) (see para 5.18).
5.09     Portfolio.  As of December 31, 1983, BDET had a loan and equity
portfolio of TD 192.0 million distributed over 680 loans (TD 168.7 million)
and 190 equity participations (TD 23.3 million). Loans to industry
represented 68% of total loans, the remainder being invested in tourism (21%),
and other sectors (transport, services). Loans were well distributed over the
several sectors of industries with agro-industries, construction materials,
EM, textiles and chemicals being the most important (Annex 3, table 7). A
relatively larger part of BDET's equity portfolio is invested in tourism (34Z,
against 53% in industry) but, this is expected to decrease in future (para
5.20).
5.10     BDET's arrears amounted to TD 15.9 million on December 31, 1984 of
which TD 11.8 million was overdue for more than three months representing
about 6.1% of the outstanding loan portfolio. These arrears were for TD 7.4
million for overdue principal and for TD 4.4 million for unpaid interest and
affected TD 26.9 million in outstanding loans representing about 13.9% of the
outstanding loan portfolio. BDET arrears situation worsened in 1984 since
arrears at the end of 1983 amounted to only TD 9.5 million of which TD 7.1
million were for more than three months representing about 4.2% of the
oustanding loan portfolio. However, although a total of 132 companies were in
arrears for more than three months, 46.2t of these arrears (corresponding to
64.3X of the total principal affected by arrears) were concentrated in 22
companies which are receiving special supervision attention. BDET's arrears
position remains acceptable but will need to be monitored closely so that
arrears can be bought down to no more than the level prevailing in 1983 as
soon as practically possible.
5.11     BDET's outstanding loans are secured by adequate collaterals.  About
4% of BDET's loans are covered by Government guarantees. Most of these
guarantees are for small-scale industry projects (FOPRODI) and cover 50 to 75%
of interest and principal amounts. Provisions for risks, amounting to TD 5.7
million or 3.0% of total portfolio outstanding at December 31, 1983, are



- 21 -
adequate to cover losses on loans and equity participations. BDET does not
make provision for individual loans, but for the entire loan and equity
portfolio. Provisions are however discussed on a case-by-case basis with the
auditors but such review is made difficuLt by the high number of companies in
arrears for which satisfactory information on financial situation is
incomplete.
5.12     Staffin.  BDET's total and professional staff has increased little
in the last few years (Annex 3, table 8). Of the 73 professional staff, 27
are working in the Project Promotion and Project Appraisal Departments. A
relatively large number of staff is presently distributed over four
administrative departments (Personnel, Administration, Commitments and
Resources/Equity Participation). However, this number should be reduced when
a computerized administrative system is put in place; this is expected to be
done by the end of 1985. BDET has lost several experienced staff to the new
development banks and to industrial companies set up in the last three to four
years and is recruiting new profess_onal staff to replenish its ranks.
5.13     The Promotion Department promotes projects which it has identified
itself. The license to establish the project is in BDET's name and it is
responsible for formulating all aspects of the project (financial, technical,
economic) and identifying local promoters and foreign partners for them.
About twenty projects have been promoted in this way since 1978: they are
relatively large, mainly in the EfI sector and require generally foreign
partners.
5.14     Project supervision has traditionally been BDET's main weakness.  The
Bank and BDET have agreed on an extensive supervision program for 1984.
During the first five months about 50 supervision missions were conducted by
BDET and a program for another 50 has been agreed for the remainder of the
year. A better coordination between the Equity Participation and the Project
Appraisal Department has also been put in place so that all financial
documentation on companies in which BDET has an equity participation is
available in the Project Appraisal Department. Staff in the latter department
is being used for supervision of projects and the department has been enlarged
through the recruitment of three additional staff in 1984. Early results of
BDET's intensified supervision are already showing a better recovery rate of
payments in interest and principal in 1984 with the exception of the 22
companies referred to in paras. 5.10 and 5.12. A reporting system and a
program concerning BDET's supervision activities was agreed upon during
negotiations which will enable BDET's management and the Bank to monitor staff
use for supervision by BDET, the number and type of projects visited, the kind
of problems encountered by BDET financed projects and the actions taken by
BDET and the project sponsors to overcome them.
5.15     BDET Performance under Bank Projects.  The pilot line extended by the
Bank in conjunction with the seventh loan to BDET (1504-TUN) was designed to
foster the development of SSI's and encourage employment creation through
increased investments and more participation of commercial banks in
financing. Out of the $7 million earmarked for this purpose, $5 million have
been lent to the Government (Loan 1505-TUN) for onlending to new SSI projects,
through BDET and five commercial banks participating in the FOPRODI scheme;
and $2 million have been lent directly to BDET, as part of Loan 1504-TUN, to



- 22 -
finance the expansion of existing SSIs. The pilot line's target group were
projects below TD 275,000 of investment cost (including permanent working
capital) and with a cost per job limit of TD 6,300 in 1980 prices. BDET
submitted fourteen projects (out of a total of twenty six approved under Loan
1505-TUN) for $4.95 million, which had an average investment cost of TD
213,000 and created about 600 jobs at an average cost of TD 5,100 in 1980
prices. BDET committed forty seven projects under Loan 1504-TUN, out of which
eleven were SSI projects with an average investment cost of TD 160,000 in 1980
prices, for a total of t1.8 million. BDET is currently participating, with
seven commercial banks, in the SSI I project of $30 million (Loan 1969-TUN)
which became effective in July 1982 and is expected to be fully committed by
June 30, 1985. BDET's commitments under Loan 1969-TUN have recently increased
after a first year of slow commitments where other SSI earmarked resources
were available to BDET. As of August 30, 1984, BDET had committed $1.6
million under this loan, for eight projects with an average investment cost of
TD 284,000 and expected to create about 250 jobs.
5.16     The last loan to BDET (Loan 2113-TUN), approu;d in March 1982, is
intended to support the development of electro-mechanical industries. It
includes (i) a $28.0 million credit line to BDET for lending to EMI priority
subsectors ($14.0 million) and to other industrial projects ($14.0 million);
and (ii) a $2.0 million to the Government for technical assistance for an EMI
technical center (CETIME), a standardization/quality cg,ntrol institute
(INNORPI), and for an effective protection study. As cf August 30, 1984
commitments and disbursements for 17 projects reached $21.0 million and $11.2
million respectively, and were in line with appraisal estimates. CETIME and
INNORPI are operating satisfactorily with adequate staff and budget. Progress
under the effective protection study has been satisfactory but somewhat slower
than originally anticipated. The loan is expected to be fully committed
before the end of 1984 and disbursed before the closing date of December 31,
1987. Overall, the performance of BDET and other institutions involved in the
EMI project have been fully satisfactory and the Bank is considering
supporting t-'.e development of this priority sector through a second EMI
project.
5.17     Projected Operational a-.d Financial Situation.  BDET's forecasts
estimate its activities to resume a normal 10% growth rate of approvals in the
period 1984-1986 (Annex 3, table 9). Based on its pipeline of applications
already submitted and the rate of new applications (about TD 20 million per
quarter), BDET should be able to approve loans and equity participations
amounting to about TD 50 million per annum during 1985-1987. These
projections are conservative and reflect BDET's intention to scale down its
exposure in the tourism sector to 25%.
5.18     Interest income (Annex 3, table 10) is projected to increase by 11.0%
on average per year in the period 1984-1988 reflecting the growth of loan
portfolio (6.2% p.a.) and the increases in interest rates already effected or
envisaged to take effect within the next years. The average interest rate on
outstanding loan portfolio is projected to increase from 8.4% in 1981 and 8.9%
in 1983 to 10.3% in 1986. Borrowing costs are projected to increase less:
the average cost of new borrowing is projected at about 9.5% (taking into
account concessionary borrowings from bilateral sources which will offset to
some extent the high cost of borrowing in the international market) while the
cest of existing debt



- 23 -
will remain at about 8.3%. The reimbursement of foreign exchange losses
amounting to TD 10.5 million by the Government will improve further BDET's
financial position. These payments which have been included in the
projections will reduce BDET's borrowing needs, strengthen its equity and
generally improve its financial position. BDET's profitability will thus
remain satisfactory and will permit payment of reasonable dividends (8X),.and
the build-up of adequate reserves and provisions, while permitting the phasing
out of the Government subsidy by the end of 1986 (see also para 6.11-6.12).
5.19    BDET's Projected Balance Sheets and Cash-Flow Statements (Annex 3,
tables 11 and 12) show further increases in share capital from TD 20 million
in 1983 to TD 30 million by 1986. Long-term debt will increase by about TD 75
million but the debt-equity ratio will remain at the reasonable level of about
6:1. The debt service coverage ratio remains satisfactory at 1:1. However
part of the improvement stems from the fact that the $60 million FRN-loan is
reimbursable in one single payment in 1990. Interest coverage, which fell to
1.1 in 1983 because of expenses related to the FRN-loan, is projected to
improve to 1.2 in 1986, which is satisfactory.
5.20     Resource position and resource requirements.  BDET's resource
position, at September 30, 1984, summarized below, shows a resource gap of TD
38.95 million or 18.2% of total available resources:

Resource Gap (1985-1987)            34.05         (0.31)      33.74
The existing resource gap plus forecast resource requirements for the period
1985-1987 amounts to TD 182.05 million of which TD 113.15 million (US 136
million) in foreign exchange and TD 68.9 million ($83 million) in local
currency. The foreign exchange requirements are forecast to be covered for TD
79.1 million by identified sources, of which about TD 48.5 million is expected
to be raised in the international market and the remainder TD 30.6 million
from bilateral (French, Italian, German and Arab) and other international
sources (African Development Bank, European Investment Bank). The Bank also
envisages follow-up projects to its EMI and SSI operations in FY85-86. The
proposed loan of $20.0 million would cover about 50X of the remaining resource
gap in foreign currency ($41.00 equivalent) and about 10% of BDET's total
resource requirements for the period. BDET's local resource needs are
projected to be covered by a TD 10 million share capital increase, net loan
repayment and internally generated cash.
5.22     During negotiations, BDET's resource mobilization plans were reviewed
and understanding on a plan for the mobilization of resources in the local as
well as in the international market in 1985, particularly with a view to
decrease short-term borrowing, was reached with the Government and BDET.
Annually the Government, BDET and the Bank will review BDET's resource
mobilization needs (see Section 4.06 of the Loan Agreement).
II.  Banque Tuniso-Koweitienne de Developpement (BTKD)
5.23     BTKD was officially created on February 25, 1981, following an
1/ Including reimbursement by Government of TD 10.5 million foreign exchange
losses.



- 25 -
agreement between the Kuwaiti and Tunisian governments signed on October 29,
1980. It started operations in March 1981, and its main objectives are the
identification, promotion and financing of economically and financially viable
projects in all sectors of economic activity in Tunisia and to strengthen
economic and financial relations between Tunisia, Kuwait and other Arab and
African countries.
5.24     The company has a share capital of TD 100 million equally owned by
the two countries (see Annex 4, table I for list of shareholders). One
quarter of its capital was paid in at its creation; the remainder was to be
paid in over a period of five years. BTKD can take equity participations,
make loans, give guarantees and provide a number of banking services including
the acceptance of deposits from abroad. The Policy Statement states that BTKD
has also as one of its objectives the development of Tunisia as an
international financial center.
5.25     BTKD does not generally finance projects with an investment cost
below TD l million. The Policy Statement indicates a sectoral distribution
for its operations: 60X in industry, 20% in agriculture, 15% in tourism and
5X in other sectors. BTKD is particularly interested in technologically
advanced projects. Its equity participations are limited to 50% of BTKD's net
worth and it cannot normally take more than 15% of a firm's share capital
except for companies when BTKD is the promotor and lead financer, where its
participation could go as high as 30%. Its maximum exposure in a single
company is limited to 10% of its own net worth but in exceptional
circumstances can go up to 15% (see para 6.10).  The interest rates BTKD
charges are 12% per year for loans up to 11 years rising to 13% for a loan
with maximum duration of 15 years. These rates are revised from time to time.
5.26     The Policy Statement stipulates a debt equity ratio of 4:1 and that
BTKD should lend only at fixed rates from its own funds or from borrowed funds
at fixed rates; otherwise variable rates should be used. Also maturities of
its lending should approximately match the maturities of its borrowing.  In
general BTKD's financial and operational policies as contained in the Policy
Statement are satisfactory.
5.27     BTKD has a Board of Directors of ten members of which the President
is Kuwaity. BTKD's first General Manager, who is not a member of the Board of
Directors, has had about ten years of service with BDET and is known as an
experienced development banker. As of December 31, 1984, BTKD had a total
staff of 74 of which 30 were professional staff. BTKD is organized in five
departments: Promotion, Appraisal/Follow-up, Equity Participation/
Representation, Controllers/Treasury and Administration (see Organization
Chart Annex 4, table 2). The department directors are experienced and
qualified people; the directors of the two operational departments are both
engineers with considerable experience in industry, while the Administration
Department is managed by a former commercial banker. The two operational
departments have in total ten professional staff members, while three staff
members are in the Equity Participation Department. The Controllers and
Administration Departments are presently directed by one director, who is also
responsible for the legal services.
5.28     The financial, technical and market analysis of BTKD's reports is of



- 26 -
satisfactory quality. However, BTKD's appraisal reports sometimes lack
comprehensive economic analysis, which may partly be explained by the
considerable number of operations in the first two years of operation. In
most cases where such detailed appraisal is missing, BTKD relied on the work
done by other financial institutions (joint or parallel financing), by
Government agencies or by independent consultants. However, BTKD has the
staff and know-how to prepare appraisal reports according to the format
described in para's 6.07 - 6.09. On the basis of a sample of appraisal
reports, particularly those concerning export industries, BTKD's appraisal
standards and procedures are considered satisfactory.   BTKD has still to
organize its supervision activity for which plans and procedures are being
worked out. These plans have been completed satisfactorily and a program to
implement them as well as BTKD's reporting requirement, was agreed during
negotiations.
5.29     As of December 31, 1983, BTKD had approved 197 loan and equity
operations for 118 projects for a total amount of TD 193.2 million, of which
TD 158.4 million in loans and TD 34.8 million in equity participations.
Commitments amounted to TD 102.6 million, while disbursements up to December
31, 1983 totalled TD 51.3 million (Annex 4, table 3). BTKD finances mainly
projects with total investments of over TD 2 million; of the 118 projects
financed by BTKD, 28 companies had investments over TD 10 million and
operations of over TD 5 million accounted for almost 25% of the total amount
approved till December 31, 1983. The remaining 90 companies had an average
investment of about TD 3 million. In total, 60 projects received financial
assistance in the from of loans and equity participations of less than TD 1
million.
5.30     Three quarters of BTKD's approved financial assistance was for new
projects, while private sector projects accounted for 62.9% (Annex 4, table
4). Public sector projects included mainly four transport projects, four
energy projects, four projects in EMI and construction and two projects for
urban development and industrial estates. It is likely that BTKD's
involvement in public sector projects will diminish but it may play a role,
with the other development banks, in the privatization of public sector
projects. Of the 63 industrial projects financed by BTKD, 26 export part or
the totality of their production.  BTKD emphasizes projects which introduce
new or advanced technology into Tunisia and partly for this reason 15 projects
have been financed with foreign equity participation irnvolving TD 19.2 million.
5.31     BTKD's financial position is sound.  Of its TD 100 million share
capital, TD 75 million has been paid in as of December 31, 1984, the remainder
to be paid in over the next year. The company has no outstanding debt and
made a net profit of TD 4.1 million up to December 1982 and TD 4.3 million in
1983, equal to 8% return on average equity, which is considered satisfactory.
In 1984, BTKD's net profit amounted to TD 6.67 million (8.7% of average
equity). These net profits have been retained as reserves. Profit and Loss
Statements and Balance Sheets are attached in Annex 4, tables 5 and 6.



- 27 -
5.32     BTKD's loan approval level is expected to come down to TD 40 million
in 1984 and grow thereafter by about 10% per year, which is considered
reasonable (Annex 4, table 7). Equity investments will be one-fifth of total
approvals. CoDmitments for the period September 1984-1987 are projected at TD
203.3 million. BTKD's resource position and needs for
September 1984-1987 are as follows:
Resource position as of 9/30/84 (TD mln)

Resource Gap (1984-1987)                      113.7     110.4         3.3
The existing resource gap plus forecast resource requirements for the period
september 1984-1987 amounts to TD 242.3 of which TD 163.9 million (US$ 197
million) in foreign exchange and TD 78.4 million in local currency.
5.33     Local currency resource requiremeats are expected to be covered by
cash generation, loan collections and share capital increases. Foreign
currency requirements are expected to be covered by share capital increases
(foreign partners) and through an issue of $50 million in the international
market. The proposed loan of $15.0 million would be small in relation to the
remaining resource gap of TD 110.4 million but would mainly serve to help BTKD
in its resource raising efforts and to provide institutional support through
the normal supervision activity of the Bank. Understanding was reached with
the Government and BTKD during negotiations on a realistic plan for the
mobilization of resources by BTKD during 1985 and BTKD's resource mobilization
plans and needs will be reviewed annually with BTKD and the Government (Loan
Agreement section 4.06).



- 28 -
5.34     BTKD's projected Balance Sheets, Income Statements and Cash-Flows
(Annex 4, tables 8, 9 and 10) show satisfactory levels of profitability. No
payments of dividend are forecast as has been agreed by the shareholders. The
debt:equity ratio remains below 1:1 during the period and debt service ratios
remain accordingly very healthy (above 2).
III. Soci4tg Tuniso-Seoudienne d'Investissement
et de Developpement (STUSID)
5.35     STUSID was created by an agreement between the Saudi-Arabian Kingdom
and Tunisia on January 6, 1981. The company started operations on May 30,
1981 and has as its main objectives the promotion and financing of industrial,
tourism, agricultural and other econnmically and financially viable projects
in Tunisia and the mobilization of capital abroad for these projects.
5.36     The company has a share capital of TD 100 million equally owned by
the two countries (Annex 5, table 1, list of shareholders). One quarter of
its capital was paid in at its creation, the remainder to be paid in over a
period of five years. STUSID can take equity participations, make loans,
provide guarantees and give technical assistance. One of its objectives is
also to help in the development of the capital market and to participate in
import and export finance. With regards to the latter, the Policy Statement
mentions that this type of finance will await legislation and creation of an
export guarantee system.
5.37     STUSID focusses its attention on projects having a favorable impact
on the balance of payments and employment. It also orients its operations
towards larger projects with investments over TD 2 million for industrial
projects and over TD 3 million for other projects. Equity participation in
projects is considered important and in practice STUSID provides its financial
assistance in the form of equity and loan in the ratio 1:2. No particular
limit is stipulated on the equity investment in one single company but the
Policy Statement gives a margin of 15-30% of its capital. The agreement
creating STUSID limits the total amount of equity investments by STUSID to its
net worth.
5.38     The Policy Statement stipulates a debt-equity ratio of 4 to 1 and
that STUSID will not bear any exchange risks. In general STUSID's financial
and operational policies, as detailed in its Policy Statement, are
satisfactory.
5.39     STUSID has a Board of Directors of ten members of which the President
is Saudi-Arabian. STUSID's first Chief Executive Officer, who is member of
the Board of Directors, was a former Director General of the Plan, former
President of STEG (Societe Tunisienne d'Electricite et du Gaz), Directeur
General of CNEI (Centre Nationale d'Etudes Industrielles) and President of
SFAX-GAFSA (Phosphates Company). He is an experienced manager and competent
professional. STUSID has recruited 45 professional staff including eight
managers in the 2-1/2 years since it started operations. STUSID has seven
departments of which five are operational (industry, tourism,
agricultare/agro-industry, promotion and planning/follow-up).  The last
department coordinates the activities of the other four and, because it is
STUSID's policy to take an equity investment in the projects it finances, is
responsible for managing the equity portfolio and



- 29 -
the follow-up on the loans. The remaining two departments concern
administration and finance (Annex 5, table 2 Organization Chart).
5.40     The company has put in place sound appraisal procedures and methods
which emphasize financial, economic, and technical criteria. On the basis of
a selection of appraisal reports, it appears, however, that improvements can
still be made particularly with regards to the economic merits of projects.
STUSID has also established a detailed follow-up policy for projects it has
financed. The follow-up activity is important given STUSID's emphasis on
equity financing. Although this activity would, as conceived by STUSID,
require a substantial manpower input, its cost is expected to be largely
covered by representation allowances (directors' fees). During negotiations
reporting requirements were discussed and agreed including those pertaining to
the supervision of projects.
5.41     STUSID makes extensive use of computer facilities.  The system covers
three sub-systems:
- project appraisal, supervision and loan administration;
- accounts, budget and payroll; and
- management information system.
Every department has its terminal and STUSID has its own personnel to develop
and implement new computer usage. Thanks to these facilities STUSID has been
able to limit the recruitment of support staff.
5.42     Operations.  As of December 31, 1984, STUSID had approved 99 projects
for a total amount of TD 157.9 million of which TD 107.4 million in loans and
TD 50.5 million in equity participations. Commitments amounted to TD 92.2
million while disbursements were TD 61.5 million (Annex 5, table 3). STUSID
finances mainly large companies: 38% of the projects financed had investments
of over TD 10 million and operations of over TD 5 million accounted for 51.6%
of the total amount approved (Annex 5, table 4). Nevertheless, 37 projects
requiring less than TD 5 million in total investments, involving TD 18.9
million were approved indicating that a substantial number of smaller projects
benefitted from STUSID's assistance. Two of the larger projects financed by
STUSID (and BTKD) have received financial assistance from the Bank (SOGITEX
and SOFOMECA).  STUSID's involvement in tourism is so far limited to only two
large projects which are cofinanced with Saudi partners. Among the "other"
projects are included three financial institutions (BNDT, BNDA and a leasing
company jointly promoted with IFC) as well as a large urban renewal project
for the city of SFAX. Altogether 62.5% of STUSID's approvals have been for
industrial projects. The TD 157.9 million approved have financed projects
costing in total TD 1.051 million which shows that STUSID was often
co-financer in these projects.
5.43     Of the projects financed, six have majority government ownership
(three energy and three urban development projects). STUSID's participation
in some of the large industrial projects, has permitted the Government to
withdraw from those pro;ects. Sixteen of the 43 projects in industry and
agriculture export the totality or part of their production. STUSID's
management attaches great importance to projects able to export at least part
of their production. A considerable number of projects are joint-ventures



- 30 -
where STUSID has attracted capital from Arab and other sources and obtained
technical or marketing experience for the projects it has financed. In 1983
STUSID approved TD 16 million in equity participations for companies in which
foreign shareholders participated for TD 30 million.
5.44     Financial Position. STUSID's financial position is sound (Annex 5,
tables 6 and 7). Of its TD 100 million share capital, TD 70 million has been
paid in as of December 31, 1984, the remainder to be paid-in over the next two
years. The company made profits of TD 2.8 million in 1982, TD 3.0 million in
1983 and TD 4.6 million in 1984. Its liquid assets of about TD 20 million are
invested in the money market at an average rate of 10%.
5.45     STUSID's Projected Balance Sheets, Income Statements and Cash-Flows
(Annex 5, tables 6, 7 and 8) show lower levels of profitability than BTKD.
This development is mainly due to STUSID's rather important equity
participation portfolio on which returns are uncertain and generally low in
the early years. No dividend payments are forecast as agreed by STUSID's
shareholders. The debt: equity ratio remains below 1:1 till 1987 and debt
service ratios remain accordingly very healthy (1.8 in 1987).
5.46     Resource Position.  STUSID's loan approvals are projected to grow
from TD 21.3 million in 1984 to TD 38.0 million in 1988 (Annex 5, table 5).
Equity participations are forecast to remain at about one-third of total
approvals, averaging about: TD 15 million a year. Commitments for the period
9/30/84-12/31/87 are projacted at TD 132.1 million, about TD 70 million less
than BTKD and about TD 10 million less than BDET. STUSID's resource position
and needs for September 1984-1987 are forecast as follows;
Resource Position as of 9/30/83 (TD mln)
Capital, Reserves and Provisions               79.43

5.47     Local currency requirements are expected to be covered for 86Z by,
cash generation, loans collections and share capital increases.  Foreign
currency requirements are partly covered by share capital increases and
through an issue of TD 15 million in the international market, leaving a
foreign exchange gap of TD 40.7 million (US$ 50.0 million). The proposed Bank
loan of S15.0 million would cover 30% of this gap and would mainly serve to
help STUSID in its resource raising efforts and to provide institutional
support through the normal supervision activity of the Bank. Understandings
on a realistic plan for the mobilization of resources by STUSID during 1985
was reached with the Government and STUSID during negotiations. Each year,
the Government, STUSID and the Bank will review STUSID resource mobilization
plans and needs (Loan Agreement section 4.06).
B. Other Institutions
I.   Export-Credit Insurance Company (COTUNACE)
5.48     The objective of export-credit insurance is to cover, through an
insurance policy, the majority of losses which an entrepreneur can incur on
its export operations because of non-payment by the foreign buyer for
commercial or political reasons. Such insurance should encourage banks to
provide loans to exporters with limited collateral. A draft Law creating this
Facility was approved by Parliament in June 1984 (Annex 7), and the company
(Compagnie Tunisienne de l'Assurance du Commerce Ext6rieur: COTUNACE) was
created September 11, 1984. COTUNACE has a share capital of TD 1 million to
be increased to TD 2 million in 1985. The shareholders are the Central Bank,
the Government, commercial banks, development banks and insurance companies.
Obligations arising from insurance policies should be covered by premium
income (commercial risk) and payments by the Guarantee Fund (political risk)
(Annex 8 Article 12). It is expected that the company will be operational in
mid-1985. The law states that all exports loans, must be insured in order to
be eligible for rediscounting at the Central Bank. The facility would be
available to all resident companies. Non-resident companies (see para 3.10)
can, on a voluntary basis, insure themselves only for commercial risks. This
limitation is similar to those prevailing in other countries providing
export-credit insurance. The facility will cover the risks of default on the
part of the foreign buyer during all phases of the transaction (start-up,



- 32 -
production, storage, transportation and settlement). In principle the
facility can also insure medium- and long-term export credits. However, the
introduction of insurance policies for these credits will have to await the
setting up of special credit facilities for this type of transactions. These
are presently being studied.
5.49     The head of the COTUNACE is an experienced Central Banker who has
assembled a number of competent staff to help him in setting up the company.
His most immediate tasks are to draft the Statutes, the Insurance Policies and
their general conditions and undertake actuarial studies to determine the
financial needs of the company based on risk evaluation, establish premiums
and evaluate the re-insurance possibilities and costs. He will also have to
design the organisation chart, determine the most important posts to be filled
and recruit the required personnel.
5.50     Originally the Bank, which helped design and establish COTUNACE with
the assistance of an expert from COFACE, had identified a need for financial
assistance to finance experts to help it in its early phases of operations.
However, in the meantime, the Tunisian authorities have identified
concessionary sources which will provide the required funds to finance a
technical assistance program that is presently being prepared by the
International Trade Center of Geneva. The development of this program is
being co-ordinated with the Bank. During negotiations the Bank satisfied
itself that COTUNACE will employ suitable consultants to assit it in its
operations. It was also agreed that the Bank will be informed on the progress
of their work as well as on the general program of COTUNACE's activities.
II. The Center for the Promotion of Exports (CEPEX)
5.51     CEPEX established in April 1973 to promote exports (see para 3.13)
has four departments: Marketing Studies, Promotion, commercial Information
and Textile, the latter because of its prominent place in Tunisia's exports.
It has a staff of 37 of which 21 are professional staff. CEPEX is governed by
a Board of Directors, whose president is also president of BDET, and includes
representatives of the most important ministries (National Economy, Plan,
Finance), the Central Bank, as well as the Chamber of Commerce (UTICA). A new
managing director was appointed in early 1982. He has helped to make CEPEX
more dynamic by recruiting qualified personnel and establishing direct
contacts with exporting firms in order to help them in overcoming problems.
5.52     To further strengthen the institutional framework with regards to
exports, the project provides for the setting up of an Export Promotion Fund
(para's 6.13 to 6.17) in CEPEX which was created in December 1984 (1985 Loi de
Finances) and which provides for its funding through a small levy on certain
imports. The Export Promotion Fund would assist new exporters in the
marketing of their products abroad and help existing exporters to promote new
products and explore new non-traditional markets. The Fund would give CEPEX
an important additional instrument to compiement its existing activities.

VI. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives and Components
6.01     The main objectives of the proposed project are to;
(a)  promote the efficient development of export industries by financing,
through BDET, BTKD and STUSID, the establishment, expansion and
modernization of industrial enterprises engaged in exports;
(b)  improve the institutional environment for exporters in three
complementary ways:
(i) the provision of funds through the Export Promotion Fund in
CEPEX for assisting exporters with the promotion of exports to
develop new markets and promote the export of new products;
(ii) assist the Export-credit Insurance Company (COTUNACE) with the
proper formulation and execution of a technical assistance
program; and
(iii) help in improving administrative procedures related to exports
particularly in the fields of customs formalities, foreign
exchange controls and import regulations.
6.02     The project would consist of a loan of $50.0 to the Government which
would pass on the proceeds to BDET ($20.0 million), BTKD ($15.0 million) and
STUSID ($15.0 million) to cover part of their resource needs for the financing
of eligible export industries projects.
A. Investment Financing of Export Projects
6.03     Pipeline of Export Projects.  On the basis of recent experience and a
review of the pipelines of projects of BDET, BTKD and STUSID the proposed
amounts will be sufficient to meet only a small part of the financial
resources needed by the three development banks to finance export oriented
projects. BDET estimates to approve about TD 12.5 million per year for
projects exporting the total or part of their production. This estimate is
based on its past approvals of loans for Law 1972-38 export projects (1982:
TD 8 million), new projects in the pipeline exporting part of their
production, requiring an estimated TD 9 million in financing, and expansion of
projects which will export part of their production. The proposed loan of
$20.0 million would therefore cover about 40% of BDET's total projected
approvals ($46.9 million at current exchange rate) for such projects in the
period 1985-1987 (Annex 6, table 1).
6.04     BTKD financed in 1981-1983, 26 export projects, of which 14 will
export 100% of their production. The total financial assistance involved in
these projects amounted to TD 53.6 million ($73.4 million). BTKD's existing
pipeli.  of export projects requires about TD 10 million (Ml2.5 million at
current exchange rates) in financing. Based on this pipeline and its
intention to put a special emphasis on the promotion of export projects BTKD
expects to approve at least TD 10 million p.a. in the next three years (Annex
6, table 2). STUSID provided TD 15.1 million ($20.7 million) for 13 export



- 34 -
projects in the period 1981-1983. Its pipeline includes 14 projects for which
the expected finance is calculated at over TD 16.7 million ($20.9 million at
current exchange rates). On the basis of this pipeline and its experience,
STUSID estimates its approvals for export projects to amount to TD 8 million
p.a. (Ml0.0 million at current exchange rates) (Annex 6, table 3). The
proposed loan of $30 million for the two institutions would cover about 40X of
their estimated approvals for export projects.
6.05     Eligibility criteria for sub-projects.  The proposed loan wotAld
finance the foreign exchange cost of works, machinery and equipment for
eligible export oriented sub-projects. The definition of export oriented
sub-projects would include (i) new enterprises which would export at least 30%
of their production and (ii) balancing, modernization and/or expansion of
existing enterprises which would export at least 50% of their incremental
production. To ensure their overall positive contribution to the balance of
payments of the country and optimum use of domestic resources, including raw
materials, labor and technology, eligible sub-projects would have to recover
their foreign exchange cost through net foreign exchange earnings within a
five year period commencing six months after completion of the investments.
Besides these specific requirements, these projects would meet regular Bank
sub-project criteria of being technically sound, and financially and
economically viable, i.e. meeting the test of a minimum 12% FRR and a minimum
10 ERR.
6.06     To ensure that the proceeds of the proposed loan will be used for a
large number of projects, the maximum loan amount for an individual project to
be financed by BTKD and STUSID will not exceed $1.5 million. For BDET, a $2
million limit would apply. In case projects are jointly financed by two or
more institutions such projects can only benefit up to a maximum of $3 million
in finance from the proposed Bank loan. No free limit would be granted for
projects submitted by STUSID and BTKD to allow a maximum of Bank review of the
limited number of projects to be financed by them. For BDET-financed
projects, a free limit of $750,000 equivalent would apply. It is expected
that about 60% of the amount and 40% of the number of projects to be financed
by BDET from the proposed loan would be for projects above the free limit.
6.07     Appraisal Format.  Sub-Project reports would provide satisfactory
justification concerning the export potential and would include inter alia:
(i) detailed market analysis with statistics of demand, supply and
imports in target markets;
(ii) justification of price/quality competitivene-3 of products to be
manufactured by the enterprises; and
(iii) steps taken by sponsors to secure an export market;
(iv) marketing channels abroad and purchase orders received or contracts
made on long-term basis, if any;
(v) past export performance in case of balancing, modernization and/or
expansion sub-projects;



- 35 -
(vi) detailed calculations of net foreign exchange earnings annually for a
period of five years showing breakdown of income and cost in foreign
and local currencies;
(vii)  eligibility to the Government's export incentives and details thereof.
6.08     All new and expansion projects should pass an ERR test in which all
outputs and tradeable inputs including capital equipment are valued in border
prices while appropriate conversion factors are applied to non-traded inputs
such as buildings and labor. Detailed justification of the border prices used
should be provided in each case and the conversion factors used should be
shown. Balancing, modernization or restructuring projects should be similarly
justified. All three development banks have sufficient qualified staff to
make the necessary analysis to demonstrate the economic viability along the
lines described above.
6.09     In order to ensure that sub-projects do not depend for their
profitability on excessive protection on that part of their output sold in the
domestic market, sub-project reports should briefly describe the relevant
protection environment and the projected profitability of the project's
domestic sales by comparison with its export sales. The description of the
protection environment should include the import protection for the project's
outputs (quantitative import restrictions, foreign exchange licensing and
tariff levels) and the import protection for the principal inputs. Projects
in the EMI sector should conform, as regards protection in the domestic
market, to the principles agreed under the EMI loan.l/ The relation, if any,
between the project and export compensation agreements should also be
described.
6.10     Financial and other covenants.  All three banks will have their
annual accounts audited by auditors acceptable by the Bank. As agreed under
the previous Loan Agreement with BDET its debt: equity ratio will not exceed
8:1, while a maximum debt: equity ratio of 4:1 will apply to BTKD and STUSID.
On the basis of the projected financial statements of the two banks this ratio
will not be attained in the next five years. BDET's maximum exposure in a
single enterprise should remain at 25% of BDET's networth as agreed in the
past; this exposure limit should be fixed at 15% for BTKD and STUSID as is
presently stipulated in their respective Policy Statements 2/. Any amendments
in the Statutes, Policy Statement and Establishment conventions should not be
made without the Bank's approval. The reporting requirements usual in DFC
loans and applied to past BDET loans would be required. BDET, BTKD and STUSID
have provided detailed supervision plans for 1985 which were reviewed during
negotiations and considered satisfactory.
1/ essentially, non-consumer electrical and mechanical products should have a
tariff protection duty of 18% or less and in the case of steel structure
and platework a protection of 21% or less.
2/ During negotiations it was agreed that STUSID and BTKD v'u-ld inform the
Bank whenever their exposure in a single company would exceed 10%.



- 36 -
6.11     Loan terms.  Bank funds would be on-lent by the Government to the
development banks in local currency at an interest rate equal to the
prevailing Bank rate. The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.
The development banks would repay their respective loans to the Government
according to the composite amortization schedule of the sub-projects financed
by the subsidiary loans. Signature of subsidiary loan agreements, between the
Government and each of the three development banks satisfactory to the Bank,
would be a condition for effectiveness. The loan to the Government would be
repaid to the Bank according to a fixed amortization schedule of 17 years,
including 4 years of grace.
6.12     The development banks would charge a minimum effective interest rate
of 11% p.a. to the sub-projects financed from the proceeds of the loan. $he
banks' interest rates will be reviewed annually between the development banks
and the Bank (Section 4.10 of the Project Agreement), with the main objective
of assuring the development banks a reasonable financial margin 1/ on their
borrowed resources of at least 2%.  Thus, while the development banks would
bear the interest rate risk on the Bank loan, the annual review would assure
the development banks a reasonable spread on its total resources.  In line
with understandings already obtained under the first EHM project, the
Government will ensure that a minimum spread of 2% will be maintained for the
development banks (Section 4.03 of the Loan Agreement). Also in line with
this agreement, this spread could include a subsidy until 1986. Thereafter
the minimum spread would have to be based solely on the interest rate policy.
The maturity of the sub-loans to be made by the development banks from the
proceeds of the loan would not exceed 14 years. including a maximum grace
period of 3 years. The final date of submission of sub-projects would be June
30, 1988.
6.13     Procurement and Disbursements.  BDET's procurement and disbursement
procedures are satisfactory; appraisal reports usuallv describe in detail and
justify the equipment to be purchased, its technical characteristics, the
names of suppliers and prices quoted. Procurement will continue to be carried
out, as under previous loans, in accordance with BDET procedures which
require, in particular, borrowers to obtain at least three price quotations
from suppliers/manufacturers. Similar procurement and disbursements
procedures will apply to BTKD and STUSID and were agreed to during
negotiations.
6.14     The proposed loan would finance the foreign exchange cost of goods,
works and services for export projects submitted by the development banks for
financing under the loan. It is estimated, that about 60% of the investment
cost of projects would be in the form of goods and services supplied from
abroad. Disbursements would be made on the basis of standard documentation as
described in the Bank's disbursement procedures, except for expenditures below
$20,000 which would be made against statements of expenditures. The closing
date would be June 30, 1991.
B. Technical Assistance to the Export-Ciedit Insurance Company (COTUNACE)
6.15     A detailed description of the objectives for the creation of the
1/ Difference between the interest rate received on the average outstanding
portfolio and the interest paid on the average outstanding amount of
borrowing.



- 37 -
company, its establishment and the need for technical assistance to ensure its
proper functioning and development is given in paras 5.48 - 5.50. The
technical assistance program will be financed by non-Bank funds. However,
given the important role that rhe Bank has played in establishing the company
and the importance that the Bank &-taches to its sound development, the Bank
will maintain a continuing involvement with the progress of COTUNACE's
operations as noted in para 5.50. Also, if non-Bank funds would not be
available by December 31, 1985 to finance all or part of the program, the
Government agreed during negotiations to finance any shorfall, that could not
be met through other financial sources. This is be reflected in the Loan
Documents (Section 5.01 (g)).
C. Export Marketing and Promotion
6.16     The financing of export marketing activities is generally difficult
and in many developed and developing countries special organisations have been
set up to provide financial assistance to potential exporters. The problem is
exacerbated in Tunisia because of the prevailing foreign exchange constraints
and ensuing foreign exchange regulations. The Central Bank is in these
circumstances reluctant to increase the amounts in foreign exchange freely
available to potential exporters. The recently created Export Promotion Fund
would provide CEPEX with an additional export promotion tool. This new
activity will foster closer relations between CEPEX and potential exporters
and allow it to better adjust its programs (market studies, trade fair
activities, publications etc.) to the specific needs of these exporters.
6.17     The Export Promotion Fund would finance marketing and promotion
activities mainly of new exporters, and similar activities for new products or
new markets of existing exporters. It would provide funds to permit the
exporter to finance his marketing plans, for which the exporter would have to
provide the Fund with documentation justifying the actual expenditures
incurred.
6.18     The need to establish an Export Promotion Fund had been identified by
the Bank and the Tunisian authorities during appraisal of the project.
Although no Bank resources would be channeled through the fund its sound
development and operation is important in encouraging the growth of exports.
During negotiations agreement was therefore reached with the Government that
an Export Promotion Fund with procedures, organisational structure and
staffing satisfactory to the Bank would be set up by December 31, 1985 and
that it would be provided with adequate financial resources (Section 3.04 of
Loan Agreement).
D. Improvement in Procedures Related to Exports
6.19     Complex and often uncoordinated administrative procedures
particularly with regards to imported and locally procured inputs used by
exporters, foreign exchange controls, drawback and temporary admission, hinder
export activities. These procedures furthermore impede the integration of
domestic and export markets in the sense that firms basically producing for
the local market would not find adequate incentives to supply exporters. For
example, firms which supply export companies are not treated equally in terms
of drawback and temporary admission as offshore firms which only produce for



- 38 -
export markets. Whereas the procedures for the latter firms are simple, the
former firms are required to go through a series of import content checks and
a more cumbersome and lengthy procedure for drawback, temporary admission and
to obtain foreign exchange.
6.20     In view of the complexity of procedures which exporters face,
involving several ministries and departments (Ministry of National Economy,
Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, Customs) and considering that many
regulations are either unclear or unknown to exporters, a comprehensive
guidebook describing the procedures for exporters is being prepared by CEPEX.
These procedures would include the reimbursement of exporters or domestic
suppliers to exporters for taxes and duties paid on locally produced or
imported inputs incorporated in exports. The Government is also aware that
the procedures require simplification, harmonization and general improvement
in their application to ensure that they do not stand in the way of expanding
exports. Recommendations to improve the existing procedures were prepared by
CEPEX and were reviewed during negotiations. Understandings were reached on
the issuance of the guidebook before December 31, 1985. Simplified
procedures, specifically concerning simplified payment and documentation
procedures with regards to exports and with regards to temporary admission of
imports used in the manufacture of export products were adopted. Another
measure, the creation of an exporters service in the customs office, which
would assist exporters with the formalities related to the imports required
for their production and the exports of their final products, is being
implemented.
E. Project Benefits and Risks
6.21     Benefits.  The loan is expected to finance projects whose total cost
would be about t125 million equivalent over the next three years. Ihese
projects are expected in time to generate exports worth about $100 million
p.a.  On the basis of statistics provided by API (Agence de Promotion
Industriel), export projects have an average cost per job of about $12,500.
It is, therefore, expected that investments financed by the proposed loans
would create about 10,000 jobs.
6.22     Furthermore, Tunisia's exports in general will be assisted by the
creation of the Export Promotion Fund and the Export-Credit Insurance Company
(COTUNACE). This institutional strengthening should help address the major
constraints of future export growth: markets and finance. Together with an
improvement in administrative procedures, these measures have a potential
benefit in terms of increased export that far exceeds their costs. While it
is not possible to assess quantitatively the effect of these measures, even an
increase of 1% in the value of export growth would translate into about TD 50
million over a period of about 5 years --far in excess of any posssible cost
for the proposed measures.
6.23     Risks.  The major risk of the proposed project is that a shortfall
can occur in the expected increase in exports. Ihe past impressive growth of
Tunisian exports of industrial products, and the priority accorded by the
Government to this sector are reassuring in this respect; also the Bank will
need to devote sufficient resources in the supervision of this important
project to minimize the risk that the funds under this project are used
without a commensurate increase in exports. On balance the risks are
acceptable and well worth taking in relation to potential benefits.

VII. REC0MMENDATIONS
7.01     The proposed loan of $50 million equivalent to the Republic of
Tunisia, consists of three lines of credit to BDET ($20 million), BTKD ($15
million) and STUSID ($15 milion) to be used for the financing of viable
export-oriented projects. Besides providing financial assistance, the
proposed project aims at establishing and providing institutional support to
an Export Promotion Fund and an Export-credit Insurance Company. It is
suitable for Bank financing given the following agreements and understandings

December 31, starting in 1985, the rates and structure of their
interest rates (para 6.12);
(x) Export promotion fund to be provided with adequate financial
and human resources and satisfactory organisation structure and
procedures by December 31, 1985 (para 6.18).



- 40 -
(xi) the Government shall ensure that funds from bilateral or
multilateral sources are available by December 31, 1985, for
the financing of the COTUNACE technical assistance program or
shall make available funds from other sources (including, if
