3    LAWS, REGULATION S AN D RESETTLENIENT POLICIES
The People's Republic of China stipulates that any authoritv engaging in rescttleimcit activities
concerning individuals and enterpriscs must draw a  cncral plan. The provincial govcrnmncnt and
local govcrnment have the right to dra\w up some preferential policics hlich detail the national laws.
The law\s and regulations associatcd with thc Sichuani Urban Environmicntal Project. together with thc
principlcs behind them, are described in the following scctions:
3. I    Principles
Thc follow-ing principles arc outliied in the Operational Directive of the World Bank. 4.30
concerning Involuntarv Resettlement.
*   Inv\olun.tary rcscttlciiiemet should be avoided or minlimizcd w\herc fcasible
*   Displaced pcrsons should bc compensated for thcir losscs at fuill replacement cost prior to the
actual move.
*   Displaced persons shou1ld be assisted wvith the move and supported durine thc transition pcriod in
the rcscttlemicit sitc.
-   Displaced pcrsons shoLIld be prov-idcd with the mcans to improv-c their formcr living standards.
incomc carinl g capacity. and productioni IccIs or at lcast to restore thcimi. Cash compeinsation
alonc is normally inadcqulate to cisurc sustain1cd/inprovcd living standards.
e   Community paricipation in planning and impicilientinig resctlemcint should bc cncouragcd.
1 'refercncc should be (gicn to land-bascd resetticmcint strategies for pcople dislocated from
agricultural scttings.
I ln\ oluntary resctticrs should bc ablc to choosc from a number of acccptablc rescttlement
altcrniatie cs.
*  Conditionis and scrv ices in host Comml1llunlitiCs should improve. or at Icast not dcetcrioratc.
1Thc following principlcs are adhered to by the People's Republic of China in its formulation of
laws and regulations for land acquisition and resettlement:
*   Rcscttleient programnics must takc into consideration thc interests of the state, the collective and
thc individual.
*   Involuntary rcsettimcent of cultivated land should bc minimized or avoidcd.
*   Rcscttled pcople's new living standard must cqual or excccd their living standard before
displacenmcnt.
*  NcwN houses must bc built according to the original structure's size and standard.
*   Pcoplc losing land totally can change from agricultural to non-agricultural status.
*  the rcscttlimcnit subsidy can bc increased if the level calculatcd on thc basis of the rcgulation docs
not mcct necds.
>tac rcgulations are therefore in accord xith thc World Bank stipulations on compensation and
rcstoration of liviinn standards for displaccd persons.

4.2     Imnpact of Resettlemenit Plans
Gerncrallv. a resettleimcnt project only has social and economilc cffects on houseiholds. and no wide
ctffcts on thc societv and cconomv. As noted in the table abov c somile farmers to be rcserttcd see thc
compcilsationi and job opportullities offcrcd as a chance to imiproxvc their linig standards. In Luzhotu.
rescttlcrs from  thc Bcijiao site have uscd their sav ings to augmrent compcinsation reccived froml the
procct. anid have built new  hlOUsCs of considerably higher standard than their prcVious h1ome1Cs. New
Obs ha c pro\ idcd thcii with a sccurc inconic and social security benfcits.
Rescttlcrs in othcr areas. howcecr. are concerincd about thc lack of livclihood sCcurity to which
losimn  thcir land \ill lcad. Such families are used to subsisting from the land rather than paviig for all
tood consuLimption. Farmicrs may chose to accept a partial loss of land for all villagers rather than
requirilig any of the work unllt to rcsettlc. Compeinsationi moelyc should allow% the villagc to recover
lost inconic by investing in ncw eiltcrprisCs. Hoxwever. care wx\ill havc to takcn that thc moncy is wecll
invcsted so that the income of these farmers docs not fall below previous Iccvs. Village lcaders are
likclv to necd support in order to assess the opportunities available.

Sichuan Urban Environment Project        APR  0 9  i999
Resettlement Action Plan             SCANNED
Supplementary
1. Chengdu PMO & Zigong PMO have interviewed the farmers who will change
from agricultural residence to urban residence after the resettlement. According to
their will, they can get resettlement subsidy and find jobs by themselves.
2. For the farmners who want to change their idea to continue farming during the
implementation of the resettlement:
a) In the case of Chengdu, the famiers live in a concentrated area, so it is difficult
to allocate lands for them in the same place. They are encouraged to move to
nearby area to obtain new farmlands. The quantity and quality of the lands will
be at least as good as their original ones.
b) In the case of Zigong, the farmers live in a scattered area. The village committee
will allocate lands for them. The quantity and quality of the lands will be at least
as good as their original ones.
