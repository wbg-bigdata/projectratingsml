Urban Pollution Impact Assessment
Al Introduction
1.1   Objectives
An Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) must consider both detrimental effects of
schemes on the environment and benefits of the scheme for the environment. The aim of this
component of the project is to develop an objective method for comparing the relative
improvements in the chemical and biological quality of water in the major rivers in the studv
area in response to improvements in the pollution control infrastructire. This is to be done bv
operating computer models which mathematically represent the major factors affecting river
water quality and allow predictions to be made of the changes in water quality for a range of
planned wastewater treatment schemes. In order to compare one scheme with another a River
Pollution Index (RPI) has been devised which quantifies the degree to which the qualitv of
water throughout a river basin meets the objectives set for water quality for that basin. The
index is dimensionless and can be used to compare the benefits of schemes in different river
basins. In this report we have considered a total of 48 different schemes in 2 river basins. The
benefits mav be compared to the costs in order to develop a ranked list of possible schemes
showving which have the greatest benefits for the least cost. Such a ranked list will be a
planning aid for the prioritisation of schemes when used in conjunction with information
regarding other economic and social factors affecting the schemes.
1.1.1  Studv Area and Scope
This study is assessing the impact of wastewater and sewerage schemes proposed in 5 cities:
Chensdu: Leshan: Deyang; Neijiana and Zizong. which discharge to 2- rivers or tributaries of
the rivers Nlin and Tuo which are themselves major tributaries of the Yangtse River. Figure
I. I is a map showing the locations and sizes of the cities and rivers. The studv also brieflv
considers impacts from industries around the cities and the effect of varving base flows in the
rivers bv releasing clean water from headwater reservoirs during times of low flows. Separate
and independent models have been constructed for the Min river basin and the Tuo river
Basin.
1.2   Summary of procedure
To assess the impact of urban pollution prevention schemes there must be an understanding of
the hydrolouv and chemistrv of the rivers. A limited amount of data is available from the
Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) routine water quality monitoring program and from
the Water Resources Bureau hvdrometric monitoring program. This data on its own does not
provide sufficient basis upon which to judge the merits of environmental infrastructure
schemes. In order to make the most of the available data computerised mathematical models
have been emploved.  These mathematical models represent the river channels and
catchments. Bv inputting the rainfall on the catchments over time the model can, by the use
of equations describing the behaviour of water as it runs off the land and flows in a channel,
predict the flows at anv point in the river svstem. By estimating the loads of pollutants
running off the catchments and emanating from the cities, towns and industries then adding

these pollutants to the river flows and taking account of the chemical reactions which will
occur in the river, a prediction can be made of the river water quality at any point in the river.
The model can be calibrated until it accuratelv represents the monitored data for the same
time period during which the monitoring occurred. By varying the inputs for rainfall and
pollutant loadings the models can be used to make reasonable predictions of water qualitv
Linder future or hypothetical conditions. The fully dynamic modelling package MIKEI I
forms the basis for predictions of water quality made in this report.
MIKEI I is necessarilv a complex model and is time consuming to set-up and run for a large
number of scenarios. We have therefore employed a much simpler model - MortSim - vhich
can be calibrated to Ms1IKEi 1. We have also developed a database application - MIKEBase -
for processing the results of MIKE I I runs and entering them into MottSim. Figure 1.2 shows
the data flow of this process.

1.2.1   Use of Overall Oxygen Demand (OD) Parameter
In order for a river to support a healthy and diverse ecosvstem (which includes man) the water
in the river shiould be well oxygenated and free from toxic pollutants. This project is
considering impacts on Sichuan's rivers from discharges of municipal wastewater which is of
domestic and industrial origin.  The two most important parameters expressing the
detrimental impact of such discharges are the 1. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) which is
a measure how much oxygen will be consumed by the fluid over a period of 5 days as a result
of processes of degradation of organic matter and respiration by micro organisms and 2.
Ammonia as the ammonium ion (NH-) which, when dissociated to free un-ionised ammonia
41367EA.APPPENDIX A                     A 4                             DECEMBER 1998

(NH3) is highly toxic to fish, ammonia also exerts an oxygen demand as it is biochemicallv
degraded to nitrate (NO3') and water; this oxyven demand is not included in the oxvgen
demand expressed bv BOD. These two factors have been combined to create a parameter of
Oxygen Demand (OD). This parameter is calculated according to the formula:
OD = BOD + 4.3 * Ammonia
The multiple of 4.3 times ammonia has been selected because. though chemically ammonia
requires 4.57 units of oxygen to decay. the decav process is facilitated by the action of micro
oraanisms and some of the ammonia ends up being incorporated into the bacterial protoplasm
in an unoxidised state such that on average 4.3 units of oxvaen are used for each unit of
ammonia.
1.2.2   The calculation of a Pollution Index
The procedure for calculating a pollution index is to compare the OD. estimated at selected
points in the river. to the OD that the river water should show if it were in a state considered
as unpolluted. The unpolluted state is determined from the river water quality standards
assigned to each reach of the rivers bv the Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB). This
standard sets limits for a wide ranse of water qualitv parameters based on the assigning
classes to reaches of the rivers. The classes are based upon the planned use of the river taking
account of the realisticaliv achievable leveis of pollution control. Classes range from I for a
river in pristine condition to 5 for a grossiv polluted watercourse. For the design horizon of
this project (2010) it is reasonable to set the target river water qualitv as Class 3 for all the
rivers except those headwater sections which have been assigned Class I or 2. At present the
rivers running through the cities of Chengdu and Zigong have been assigned a standard of
Class 4 bv the citv EPBs because the long term objective of Class 3 is not presentiv
achievable. The class 3 standard for BOD is 4 mg/I and for Ammonia it is 0.02 ma/l of free
un-ionised ammonia.
From the river classifications the OD objective is calculated based upon the objective for
BOD and the derived objective for ammonia. The reach pollution index is calculated bv
selecting a representative point in the river reach. calculating the OD predicted by the
computer model (ODp) at this point and dividing the OD, bv the objective OD (ODo). If the
reach pollution index ODp I OD, is less than 1.0 then the reach mav be considered to meet its
objective. in sLIcI cases the index is normalised to 1.0. If the reach pollution index ODP / ODo
is greater than 1.0 then this is an indication of the degree of pollution.
It is desirable to combine the indices calculated for each reach of a river to create an overall
river pollution index. Because the river systems under consideration consist not oniv of the
main river channel but also of a number of important tributaries the river pollution index is
calculated for all these reaches and then called a river basin pollution index. The river basin
pollution index is derived by subtracting I from the reach pollution index to eliminate any
reaches that meet their objective. multiplving the reach pollution index bv the length of the
reach. then dividing the total of this for all reaches bv the total length of the river. This index
would be zero for an unpolluted river. Because the basin pollution index is normalised by
length it is reasonable to compare the index calculated for one river basin with that calculated
for another to give an overall indication of the degree of pollution.

Because the class standard concentration for ammonia is expressed as free unionised
ammonia it is necessary to translate this to a concentration of ionised ammonium. This can be
done using a standard relationship which is dependent on temperature and pH.  The
temperature is modelled in MIIKE I and a gtlobal pH of 7.9 has been selected following a
review of monitored pH values. For a uYiven concentration of ammonium the proportion
unionised will increase with both temperature and pH.

A2 Computer Modelling Methods
2.1  Introduction
The basis of all the vater qualitx' predictions in this project component is the computer model
MIKE I I developed and used by DHI to model the Min. Tuo and Yangtze River basins. This
is a filliv dynamic. I dimensional. hvdraulic and water quality model based upon data
describina the diffuse inputs from rural and urban river catchments and point source inputs
representing known domestic and industriai discharges. The input data have been prepared by
COWl to represent the catchments for a range of different vears - 1987, 1995, 2000. and
2010. The model was calibrated to 1986-7 data then verified against 1993-4 data. The
calibration and verification are effected by running I vear's rainfall data through the model
then comparing the predicted flows and water chemistrv to records of field measurements.
Changes are made to the coefficients in the model that describe the physical and chemical
processes in nature. and modelling assumptions and simplifications are reviewed until a good
match is made between simulated and measured river data.
2.2   Choice of Input Data for models
For the purposes of comparing wastewater improvement schemes it has been decided onlv to
considered the situations in which the detrimental impact of the schemes is greatest. This is
the situation of low river flows when there is the least available flow in the river to dilute and
disperse the pollutants. Low river flows occur in Sichuan during the drv season which lasts
from Januarv to eariv April.
To simplifv data handling the average of one month results have been used in the calculation
of all indices. It is considered that averaging over one month gives a period that is long
enough to smooth the data and ensure that it is consistent. but short enough to ensure that it is
representative of drv season conditions. To confirm the choice of the low flow month and see
how floxw variations affect the water qualit,v. the average BOD and ammonia was calculated
for each month from .MIKE1 I results for whole of 1987 then the maximum and minimum
months selected to respectiveil represent low and high flow situations.  This range of
pollutant zloncentrations under different flow conditions is shown in Figure B5. included in
Annex B. for the River Tuo. All of the major peak values occur in the month of March.
confirming that this is the logical choice for low flow representation.
-As well as selecting the lowest flow month of the vear. flows have been selected for a vear
representing particularlv low flows. Full river flow data are available oniv for 1986-7 and
1993-4. to put these 2 years in context a brief analysis of the average annual flow data from
the rivers since 1957 shows that. for the Min and the Tuo. 1987 is in the lower region of
averaue flows. While annual averase flows do not reliably reflect low flow situations this
data is all that has been made available to the project and it was not considered worthwhile to
pursue a more detailed analvsis of flow data since it wvould be unlikelv to significantly alter
anv of the relative rankings of the schemes. It has therefore been decided that flow data for
March 1987 will be used in all MIIKE II runs for this project component. The last 2 weeks of
Februarv were also run to provide a warm-up period for the model.

Volume i - Appendix A
The major scenarios considered are the impacts on water quality of the proposed wastewater
schemes in the cities of Chen-du and Leshan on the Min River and Deyang, Neijiang and
Zigong on the Tuo River. Estimates have been made of the likely reduction in discharges
loads that will be achieved bv each of these schemes and MIKE I I run to simulate the changes
in water quality that will be brouL1gt about by each of these schemes in isolation and by all
possible combinations of schemes. The runs have been made using 1987 and 2010 catchment
load data. All catchment loadin2s are derived from the Julv 1997 version of the spreadsheets
for urban. rural and industrial loadings prepared by COWI. Load reductions are derived from
the WWTW process desigzn specifications prepared in Julv 1997 bv Nlort MacDonald. Table
.1 summarises the definition of the MIKE I I runs.

2.3   Method of Data processing and information extraction
ivlKEI I produces results as tables of the daily average water qualitv for each calculation
node in the mnodel. Calculation nodes are spaced about 2 km apart. The results have been
extracted from 'vlIKEI I as the monthly average of everv daily averaae for a stretch of the
river considered to be representative of each river reach. Reaches have been defined bv
looking graphically at all the data for I month along the entire length of the river and defining
the points that represent changes in river characteristics. Figures A I-A3. in Annex A. show
the daily averaue values for BOD. Ammonia and Flow and illustrate the reach definitions for
the Min River Basin and Figures A4-A7 for the Tuo River Basin. A Visual basic application
- \llKEBase - w'as written for the purpose of rapidly extracting the required summary
information from this large volume of results data produced by MIKEI 1.   MIKEBase

automatin2 the logical process of data extraction, helps to reduce the possibilitv of accidentat
data processing errors.
2.4   Simplified MIodelling
Considerable time and resources are required to set-up and run scenarios on MIKEI H. In
order to consider a wide ranme of schemes it is desirable to have a quick and simple model
that can be calibrated to MIKE II and then used to look at a large number of scenarios. A
spreadsheet model - MlottSlMl - has been created for this pLurpose. It is a steadv state mass
balance model which takes account of the major chemical processes in the river. This model
works by considering each point for which MIKEI I results have been extracted as a node. It
is first calibrated to the baseline data. The data input to this simplified model are values of
averaee monthlv Flo,. Temperature. Dissolved Oxygen (DO). BOD  and Ammonia
concentrations for each node. The model predicts the likely decay and reaeration that will
occur as the water flows to the next node.  It then compares the expected flows and
concentrations with those uliven for the next node. Anv differences between MottSim and
MIKEI I are considered by MottSim to be as a result of inflows between the nodes and the
flow rate and concentrations of such inflows are calculated so that when mass balanced with
the flows from the upstream node thev result in an exact match to the data provided by
MIKEI 1. Thus the model automaticallv calibrates itself to the MIKE1 I data. Calculated
inflows are inspected and reviewved to assess whether they are realistic or whether some
variation should be made to the reaeration or decay coefficients. The calculated inflows
represent surface run-off. discharges and abstractions between nodes as well as sedimentation
and resuspension processes.
Once the IvlottSim model has been calibrated it may be used to make predictions bv replacingz
the formulae which calculate the compensation inflows with the fixed values that have been
calculated. The input data may then be varied to reflect a new scenario. such as reduced
discharge loadings as a result of the provision of sewagze treatment. The model wvill calculate
the impact of this scenario both locallv and in all downstream locations.

has been made to using MIKE I I data directlv. In Leshan MIKE I I has calculated a flow
balance at the confluence of the Min and the Dadu which involves the dilution of upstream
Min waters in the centre of Leshan with cleaner water from the Dadu. Because MottSim is
not suitable for directly simulating backwater effects a different method of calculating
concentrations of *vater in the Min at Leshan has been devised. It is assumed that there is
only a small increase in overall forward flows between the node just upstream of Leshan and
the confluence of the Min and the Dadu.  It is then assumed that the concentration of
pollutanits in this short reach can be estimated as the load from  upstream  plus the load
expected to be discharged by Leshan. This results in a higher estimation of concentrations
than that from MIKEI I and also a _treater sensitivity to predicted changes in water qualitv as
a result of changes in the loads discharged in Leshan city centre.

In order to verify MottSim's abilitv to make predictions of water quality under changing
loads, the inflows are fixed then the BOD and Anmmonia expected to be removed by the
proposed WWTW is subtracted from the loads in the rivers by appiving a percentage
reduction in the total loads of pollutants carried bv the river which is proportional to the total
load dischar-ed from the citV with treatment divided by the total load dischargied from the city
w% ithout treatment. Reductions are made in this way rather than bv directiv subtracting the
load removed by treatment from the load in the river because the load in the river at the node
or nodes representing a citv mav be less than the total load discharged by the city due to

the higher concentrations predicted in the Min just upstream of its confluence with the Fu are
because MIKEI I disperses flows upstream in order maintain the stability of the water qualitv
model. It is considered that the predictions are close enough to confirm that the MottSim
model is a valid tool for predictingz water qualitv changes due to changes in sewage
discharges.

Figure 2.6 shows the verification of MlottSim predictions of water quality followving proposed
Phase I sewage treatment in comparison with the same prediction by MIKE  11. Again there is
a very close agreement between the two models.
2.7  Some Simplifications and Assumptions of the Modelling Methods
In Chengdu. for Phase I WWTW  and sewerage schemes. it is assumed that the load
reductions will be split between the Fu and the Shahe but that there will be no reductions in
loads to the Nan. The split of load reductions has been worked out by considering the
planned schremes. the distributioni of populationi and the predicted loads in the rivers. It is
estimated that the interceptor sevsers will result in a 65%  reduction in BOD and 30%
reduction in ammonia discharzed to the Shahe. The rest of the anticipated reduction in load is
in the Fuhe downstream of its confluence with the Shahe.
For the assessment of greater levels of seweraae and treatment in Chengdu it is anticipated
that up to 0/ of the load in the Nanhe can be removed by sewerage and that reductions from
treatment will occur in the same location as for Phase 1.

In Devang it is estimated that the loads from the city are discharged into both the Mianyuan
and the Shitine rivers according to a 70:30 split. The MIKEI I runs were made assumine a
50:50 split and that any reductions due to treatment will follow  this split. therefore the
MottSim model has been calibrated with a 50:50 split . However. when making predictions
of improvements due to treatment, it has been assumed in MottSim that Phase I WWTW will
only improve the discharges to the Mianyuan. but that further expansion of treatment or
improvements in industrial discharges will improve both the rivers according to the 70:30
split.

It has been assumed that all minor industries are located in the area covered bv the model
node for a city. As far as possible major industrv load reductions have been applied to the
node nearest to them as identified using the information presently in the Arcview GIS svstem.
This is of particular relevance for the Mlin River where all the Top 10 major industries have
been identified as beii2 on the reaches of the upper Min. downstream  of Dujiangvang and
upstream of the confluence with the Fuhe. Figures Fl to F5. in Annex F. are Maps showina
the locations of manr of these industries.
When considerina different scenarios the models. both MottSim and IMIKE 1. assume that
the decav rates of BOD and Ammonia remain constant. This would not in fact be the case.
the rate of decav. of sedimentation and of interaction with sediments would all chan2e in
relation to concentration but such changes are not considered to be significant enough to be
worth trying to model in the scope of this project.
It is assumed that. following a reduction in loads. the rate of decay of the remaining BOD will
be the same as before the reduction. This is a simplification because raw domestic sewvage

contains organic matter that is readily degradable and large numbers of micro organisms
ideally suited to assisting this decav where as secondary sewage and some industrial sewage
mav be far less degradable and not contain the appropriate micro organisms.
When considerinig industrial treatment schemes it has been assumed that the entire load will
be prevented from reaching the river.
The hydraulic representations in MottSim  are verv simple. relying on thie sophisticated
analvsis carried out in MIKEI I to provide the tlow data. The velocities of flow and hence
times of travel in MottSim have been estimated from the known channel dimensions and the
quantity of flow. No relationships between the flow and the velocitv are established.
Therefore, when considering flow augmentation schemes. it has been assumed that flow
velocities remain constant.

M/lodels were run for March 1987 flowvs in all cases and for 1987 and '010 discharae loads.
These txmo vears were chosenl because 1987 is the year for which a complete data set exists for
the calibration of the model and 2010 is the design horizon for the project. Full results of this
analvsis are presented graphically in Figures Cl to C4. in Annex C. Table 3.2 below

From this it may be seen that the Chengdu wastewater scheme is likelv to provide the greatest
benefit for the rivers in comparison to anv other scheme. The Leshan wastewater scheme is
not expected to yield any significant improvements in the overall qualitv of the River Min as a
result of the verv larye dilutions provided by the inflow of the River Dadu in Leshan. Devang
wastewater scheme will improve the qualitv of the Mianvuan and Shiting rivers into which its
discharges flow but will not significantly improve the qualitv of water in the Tuo river.
Neijiang wastewater scheme will result in a marginal improvement in water quality in the
Tuo.
It is also clear that there is expected to be a verv considerable deterioration in the quality of
both rivers in the next decade or so and that the pliase I wvastewater schemes will alleviate
only a very small proportion of this deterioration. In Figures C2 and C4. in Annex C. the
water qualitv objectives are shown and it mav be seen that verv little of the rivers meet these
objectives.

uslnm the MIKE I I results. The MottSim models include Zigong. the river Fuxi and the reach
of river Tuo runniniz from the contluence with the Fuxi to the confluence with the Yansztze.
Also greater detail has been included in Leshan to illustrate localised changes in water qualitv
and in Chenydu to show how water qualitv will chanyse in the rivers upstream of the main
sewaue discharge point as a result of improved sewerage.
All MottSim Runs have been carried out for the 20 10 loads design horizon. The scenarios
that have been looked at are:-

4.     Treatment or prevention of discharges from all Minor Industrial polluters in each city
z.     Release of additional clean flows from headwaters of the rivers to dilute pollution

Table 3.3 summarises the loadings and assumptions made for the scenarios involving
wastewater treatment.  These factors have been run in different perrnutations both for
individual cities and for combinations of cities. The objectives of choosing scenarios to run
are to determine:
I.     which schemes have the greatest benefit;
2.     what Nvorks are required to achieve significant improvements in the qualitv of the
rivers and prevent further deterioration:
3.     which schemes have the best cost^benefit.
The results of this stage of the analvsis are approximate. given the many assumptions and
approximations made in the methodologies. but should indicate the most promising projects.
Tables 3.4 and 3.5 show the scenarios that have been run and the results predicted bv the
models.
Fewer scenarios were run on the River Min because:
I.    there are fewer cities to consider:
2.    indLustrial discharges in Leshan are collected bv an interceptor and dischargzed
downstream of the confluence with the Dadu were thev are massivelv diluted:
3.     the minor industrial discharges in Chengdu and Leshan are assumed to be collected
by new sewvers and transported to the treatment works where the load is added to that
from domestic sources.

A  summary of the modelline results for all the scenarios considered is presented in Table 3.4

Chengdu
For the analvsis of the Phase I schemes the findings from MottSim are. not surprisinilv, verv
similar to those from the MIKE I I only analysis. The greatest benefits from the proposed
Phase I sewveraee scheme will be noticeable in the Shahe as it runs through the city where
there could be as much as a 50% improvement in the reach index and in the Fuhe downstream
of the city whiere there wvill be around a 20% improvement. The Minjiang down as far as
Leshan will be improved as wvell. but only bv around 10%. However, for all reaches except
for the Shahe this still represents an overall deterioration since the 1987 condition. To
achieve a better river water qualitv than in 1987 the citv of Chengdu needs to treat more than
80% of the wastewater produced and even this will not ensure compliance with the Class 3
target during low flows. To achieve the water qualitv objective all vear it will be necessarv to
increase the base flow in the rivers at times of low rainfall by releasing clean stored water
from upstream or diverting from irrigation schemes.
Treating the top 10 major industries in Chengdu prefecture indicates that for Chengdu there
would be less benefit than treatment of municipal wastewater. This is largelv because the
industries being on the Min river (see Figure Fl. in Annex F.) do not contribute to the
pollution of the Fuhe svstem  which. because of verv higzh OD concentrations, makes a
proportionally higher contribution to the basin index. Because the flows in the section of the
Min downstream of Dujiangyans are so low during the drv season the discharges to it in this
area have a very detrimental effect. Thus there is a veryv  reat variation in the assimilative
capacirv of this river between the drv and the wet season.
Some of the industr t from Chen¢du discharoes to irrigated channels wvhich form tributaries of
the Tuo river. Principle amongst these is the Chuanhua Chemical Works which discharges
very large quantities of ammonia. This discharge contributes heavily to the pollution of the
upper reaches of the Tuojiang. Preventing this discharge would bring about an improvement
as great as treating the major Neijians industries.
Leshan
The %kastewvater treatment scheme proposed for Leshan involves collecting some of the
wastewater which is presentlv discharged to the Min as it flows through the city,. then
convevingo it to a new treatment works -which is located on the banks of the \lin downstream
of its confluenice wvith the Dadu river. here the sewage will receive secondary treatment prior
to discharge. The \xater quality modelling shows that this scheme will hlave onlv a verv
minimal benefit for the qualitv of the Min as a whole. The flows in the Dadu are so great
(>400m'./s at lowv tlows compared to about 75 m'/s in the Min) and unpolluted that there is a
very large capacity for assimilating w,vastewater. Even the entire discharge of wastewater from
Leshan w%-ill cause no siEnificant deterioration at this point. However there is a problem of the
untreated sewage that is presently discharged to the Min in the citv causing serious local
pollution of that river. Improvements in the water qualitv and aesthetics of the river in the
citv can be achieved by sewerage alone.
The water qualitv benefits of sewerage and treatment schemes are illustrated in Figures 3.2 to
3.4. Here the effect of different levels of sewerage provision are compared with the effect of

wastewater treatment. The effect of a WWTW on river water quality mav be seen at the node
on the Min downstream of the Dadu confluence as a verv slight fall in pollutant
concentrations in a part of the river which alreadv comfortablv meets its water qualitv
objective, The verv considerable benefits of Sewerage are also clearly illustrated. These
modelling results also indicate that there will be high concentrations of ammonia in the Min
as it flows to Leshan. Almost all this ammonia is from sources upstream. Even with full
sewerage and treatment in Leshan there will continue to be high levels of ammonia in the
Nuin. The greatest source of this ammonia is Chenadu and the effect of the provision of the
proposed sewage treatment in Chengdu is shown. Unlike BOD. discharges of ammonia affect
the water qualitv for a long distance downstream because it decavs much more slowly.
It is estimated that the initial proposal for Phase I sewerage and treatment will collect and
treat 30% of the Leshan wastewater. Much greater improvements in the qualitv of the local
environment could be brought about bv focusing on the collection of sewage and deferring the
provision of secondarv treatment. Much of the northern part of the city drains to the Zhugong
river which is a small river running through the middle of Leshan and flowing into the Mn.
This is presentlyv grosslv polluted with sewage and makes a verv unsightly mess where it
mixes with the Min. The construction of interceptors along this watercourse would result in a
very significant improvement in water qualitv and reduce the health risks resulting from of
people coming into contact with water containing high concentrations of fresh sewage.
The sewage from new interceptors should be collected together and pumped to a point well
downstream of the "Bis Buddha" tourist attraction which is an environmental protection zone.
Here the sewage can be screened and then discharged to the midstream of the river through an
outfall with diffusers. The industrial wastes are presently discharged from a single point
outfall directly in front of the Buddha and cause a verv visible and offensive plume. these
should be diverted into a new interceptor system.
Other major industries in Leshan prefecture discharge to the Min several kilometers
downstream of the Dadu. It is not considered that they are a significant source of oxvgen
demanding pollution.
Devang
Because Devang is at the top of the Tuo river svstem improvements in discharges in Devang
will have a significant effect for many miles downstream. The proposed WWTW will bring
about a significant improvement in water qualitv in the Mianvuan river and will slightlv
improve the quality of the upper Tuo. This scheme will not improve the Shiting river. either a
second treatment works or more interceptors and an extension to the Phase I works would be
required. Industrial discharges are not so significant in Devang. though the quality of the
upper parts of the Mianyuan could be improved by reducing BOD discharges from the paper
mills. the overall impact of these industries is not as great as some of the industries further
downstream.
The Mianvuan has a low flow during the drv season (< 4 m;/s) and therefore discharges of
pollutants from the city result in ecologically damaging and unhealthily high concentrations in
the river. As an alternative or in addition to reducing the discharges it is possible to improve
water qualitv bv increasing the base flow. A release of up to 5 m-'/s from the headwaters of

the Mianvuan in order to maintain a minimum flow in the river of about 10 m3/s will result in
a, simiiar improvement in drv season water qualitv as the provision of treatment of domestic
and industrial wastewater.
Neijiang
The river Tuo. which is verv heavily polluted d ownstream of Chengdu and the confluence of
Mivianvuan and Puyang. has. bv the time it reaches Neijiang. purified itself to a verv large
degree. Discharges from Neijiang once again cause the water to become seriouslv polluted.
In the area of Neijiang, domestic wastewater contributes a smaller proportion of the pollution
loads than from  industrv and from  the towns and agriculture in the surrounding area
(Domestic sources 25% of total). Thus the proposed wastewater works. which will treat about
half of this domestic load will not have a verv great impact on the overall quality of the river.
The greatest contribution to pollution is considered to be from the many minor industries in
the area.  These are difficult to treat because of their dispersed nature.  Treatment of
discharges from the top 10 major industries in Neijiana prefecture will yield 3 times the
benefit as the proposed first phase of domestic treatment.
Schemes involving the release of additional flows from the headwaters will bring little benefit
in the Neijiang area.
Zigong
Zi2ong is built beside the Fuxi river which has verv little baseflow. In the drv season the
upstream flows are typically less than I m'/s and may stop altogether. Thus downstream of
Zigong the bulk of the river's flow is raw sewage and industrial discharge and the
concentration of pollutants is very high indeed. Treatment of wastewater is verv important in
Zigong. Because the quality of the river water is so much worse than the target qualitv. the
river pollution index indicates the greatest benefits for the treatment of Zisong wastewater
despite this being the smallest proposed works.
According to the data available industrial discharges are a much smaller source of pollution in
Zigzong than domestic wastewater - 80% of pollution load is of domestic origin.. The major
polluting industries in Zigong region are chemical works and sugar refineries and are located
on the iower sections of the Fuxi or on the Tuo  where their impact is less. Water qualitv
improvements should therefore focus on the gradual expansion of municipal sewerage and
treatment
Just treating polluting discharges will not achieve the river water quality objective of class 3
at all times. There is insutfficient baseflow in the river to dilute even treated effluent to a great
enough degree. The oniv wvav to achieve an acceptable water qualitv in the Fuxi. with a citv
the size of Ziizonm located on it. is to construct storage upstream or divert flows from another
river and release this water during the dry season in order to maintain a minimum flow which
is sufficient to dilute the pollution.  It is recommended that the feasibilitv of increasing
baseflows and the merits of tertiarv treatment of wastewater be considered in the second
phase of SUEP.

Benefits for whole River Basins
The combinations of treatment strategies show that for the river Min it is possible to effect
considerable improvements in xvater quality and Qet quite close to meeting water qualitv
objectives in the fiture. Unfortunately in the Tuo catchment even combining all the treatment
schemes together will not prevent further deterioration of the river. However there will be
benefits for the localitv of the cities and there will be an increase in the lensth of river reaches
betwveen the cities which do meet their river water qualitv objectives. For example for the
'010 baseline situation oniv the 110 km reach of River Tuo upstream of Neijiang is expected
to meet its water quality objective. For the scenario covering complete treatment of all
discharges (T26) the length of compliant reaches increases to 195 km with a further 25 kin
extension upstream of Neijiang and an additional 60 km upstream of the confluence with the
Fuxi. The total length of river reaches modelled in the Tuo Basin is 672 km.
By contrast. for the Min river. although complete treatment of municipal and industrial
wastewater (M13) in 2010 results in a considerable improvement in the qualitv of the water
and a large reduction in the pollution index. the length of river that actually meets its river
water quality objective during the low flow situation does not increase from the baseline 405
km out of a total River basin lenath of 685 km. It is oniv for the most extreme combined
treatment and flow au2mentation scenario resulting in a basin index of 0.37 that there is a
increase to 449 km length of reaches meeting their objectives under the March 1987 low
flows hvdraulic situation.

A5 Benefit Cost Analysis
5.1  Introduction
The objective underlving all of this water quality modelling work is to identify. from a
selection of possible wastewater treatment and collection schemes. those bringing the greatest
benefit to the environment and to the people of Sichuan for the least expenditure of limited
funds. Normally in a benefit cost analvsis a monetarv value is calculated to quantifv the
benefits and this may be compared directlv with the construction and operating costs of the
project. For an environmental improvement project such as SUEP it is not practical or
realistic to attempt to calculate a monetarv value for the benefits which is why we have
devised an alternative. the River Basin Pollution Index (RBPI). which provides a sound.
objective and consistent quantitative measure of benefit. For this section of the report we
have calculated a benefit cost index as:
BaselineRBPI - SchemeRBPI * 10.000
PVcost
The schemes can then be ranked bv this index to clearlv identify those with the greatest
benefit to the qualirv of the river whole basin for the least cost.
5.1.1   Calculation of Costs
All costs have been calculated based on the costs of the Phase I sewerage and sewage
treatment schemes that have. at this stage (September 1997). been properiv costed. The cost
used is the Present Value (PV) of each scheme in millions of Yuan RMB. assuming a
discount rate of 10%. Costs for all the other schemes have been calcuiated in relation to these
costs. Costs for the complete treatment of the wastewater from each citv have been estimated
by adjusting Phase I cost estimates pro-rata to the treatment load. expressed in tud of oxvgen
demand. This will inevitably give oniv approximate estimates since the cost will not
accurately account for the seweraae component.  An advantage of allocating costs in
proportion to oxygen demand is that. because the OD is calculated vith a multiple of 4.3 on
the ammonia load. the higher costs of ammonia removal relative to BOD removal are taken
into account. Costs for complete treatment are inclusive of the cost of Phase I ty,pe treatment
not in addition to it.
For the calculation of the costs of the treatment of major industries all costs have been based
on the costs of treatment in the Zigong WWTW. The reason for choosing this is that the
Zionr sclheme invol\es relativeil little sewerage and is also quite a small works so is more
likely to be representative of the sort of works required at an industrial installation. It is
realised that there is great variation in the methods of treatine different industrial wastes some
of whiicih will be more expensive and some of which can be achieved by changes in the
factory processes and mav. in the long term. bring about an overall saving in costs. Thus less
confidence can be placed in the accuracy of the industrial costing.  The costs of treating
discharges from minor industries have been calculated in the same wav but it is considered
that, because of the dispersed nature of the smaller industries. it is more difficult and
expensive to organise treatment of these wastes. therefore a 50% increase has been applied to
the Zigong based cost. No clear line has been drawn between those minor industries that

discharge to sewers and those with separate discharges.  Therefore, to some extent, the
treatment of municipal sewage includes the treatment of a proportion of the load from smaller
industries. No costs have been calculated for flow augmentation schemes. therefore thev are
not included in this benefit cost analysis. It is possible however that such schemes would have
high benefit cost ratios.
5.2   Discussion of Results
Table 4.1 shows a list of all the schemes involving the treatment of wastewater discharges
which have been considered ranked with those wvith the highest benefit cost index at the top.
It may immediately be seen that the treatment of discharges in Ziaong receives a verv hi,h
prioritv. this is because the river Fuxi is so heavily polluted bv domestic wastewater from
Zigong and has so little baseflow in which to dilute these pollutants.

Deyang is also a citv wvhere investments in wastewater infrastructure will vield sisnificant
improvements in the environment. The treatment of domestic wastewater from Chengdu
yields very great benefits for the whole Min River but the costs are relatively high. Despite
causing pollution of the Tuo. treatment of wastewvater from Neijiang does not show very great
overall benefits for the Tuo basin. The flows from upstream of Neijiang are relatively clean
due to self-purification in the river. The baseflow in the river is lariger than at anv of the other
cities in the Tuo basin (> 40 m%'s) providing more dilution. but most significantly the low
- radient of the river in this area results in low flowv velocities downstream of Neijiang. thus
the pollutants have time to decay in a relativeil short distance.  Because the river basin
pollution index is based on the length of river polluted. the overall impact on the index is
small. Leshan is the citv in which money spent on wastewater treatment will yield the least
significant improvements in the overall qualitv of its river basin. However the provision of
sewerage in Leshan will have significant benefits for the local environment of the city. and it
is believed that these benefits justifv the pollution control works - particularly the sewerage.

To clarifv the relative benefits of municipal wastewater treatment schemes Table 4.2 shows
the benefits and costs of full municipal wastewater treatment - as represented bv 80% BOD
and ammonia removal - and the benefits and costs of the Phase I schemes. The order of the
schetnes remains the same showing that this first programme of wvorks is a step in the right
directioni. The total benefit cost has been calculated for all the cities and indicates that despite
hialher costs the overall benefit of providing a high level of treatment in the future is greater
thani only providing partial treatment. This is largelv due to the fact that the scenario of
removingQ 80% of BOD and ammonia removes a greater proportion of the ammonia than the
Phase I scenarios and. because of the greater OD per ton and lower decay rate of ammonia.
shows a ureater overall benefit.

In table 4.3 the benefits and costs of industrial wastewater treatment have been extracted.
illustrating that overall there is a less favourable return on investment for this type of
treatment compared with the treatment of domestic wastewater.  However it must be
remembered that the calculations of both benefits and costs for this type of scheme have been
carried out with far more assumptions and approximations than for the municipal wastewater
schemes and so less confidence can be placed in their rankings.

A6 Conclusions
1.     This study evaluates only the effects of BOD and Ammonia discharges on river water
qualitv. The first pre-requisite of anv water pollution control policy must be to
control the industrial discharge of toxic chemicals. This is best done and most
cheaply done by the separation of offending discharges within the factorv. All
conclusions below and all other priorities are secondarv to this requirement.
2.     The prediction of the water qualitv modelling work is that unless major steps are
taken to reduce and treat discharges the quality of the water in the rivers Min and Tuo
is going to seriously deteriorate from its presently bad condition.
3.     For the river Min the provision of full secondarv treatment of sewage from Chengdu
combined with the treatment or elimination of the major industrial discharges will
reverse this trend and mav even result in improvements in water quality. If additional
water can be released during the dry season from upstream sources then it will be
possible to get very close to meeting the water quality objectives for the river all year
round. Such consistent improvements could greatlv enhance the ecosystem of the
river and provide the people living along the river with a healthier environment.
4.     The modelling indicates that secondary treatment of sewage discharges from Leshan
would vield no significant benefit for the river Min. The greatest benefits in Leshan
will be effected by the provision of sewerage to transfer wastewater from the city
centre downstream  to where it will be diluted to an acceptable concentration.
Preiiminary treatment and a wvell designed outfall wvill be sufficient to ensure that this
locality does not suffer from serious localised pollution and will prevent the discharge
of gross and floating solids.
-   5.  The river Tuo is at present more seriouslv polluted than the Min and this problem
mav be expected to worsen in the future. Even the secondarv treatment of all
municipal sewage and the treatment of both major and minor industries will not be
sutfficient to raise the water quality to an acceptable standard throughout the basin at
all times of the year. This must be in part due to the expected increase in discharges
from the manv smaller towns in the catchment. but the main problem is the low flow
in the river during the dry season which is insufficient to adequately dilute even
secondary treated wastewater discharges.

6.     Unless wavs can be found to increase the drv season base flows there is little hope of
meeting river water quality objective for very much of the length of the rivers in the
Tuo Basin. The Scenarios involving the release of additional flows from head waters
show that this is a verv effective wav of improving water quality during the drv
season. If the construction of reservoirs is planned in the headwaters of these rivers
then the abilitv to maintain minimum tlows in the rivers could be a major benefit of
such projects. Alternativelv water could be diverted from irrigation schemes in order
to maintain minimum flows and the costs of this offset against the costs of providing
further wastewater treatment. The highest prioritv locations for such schemes would
be in the upper Mianvuan and upper Fuxi rivers. Hlowever such schemes will not
provide significant improvements during wetter seasons.

APPENDLX B.1
THE APPROACH TO WATER TREATMENT
Bl.1 Introduction
The followinz four water treatment works are included in the SUEP:
* Zigon-
*  Leshan
*  Luzhou Beijiao
*  Luzhou Daxikou
The Zigong works will draw raw water from the Min River whilst the source for Leshan is the Qingyi
River. a tributary of the Dadu. The source for both works in Luzhou is the Yangtze.
These rivers have a common characteristic in that they can carrv high suspended solids loads at times
of high flow in the rainv season. Loads can range up to 30 000 mg/I for short periods. The
performance of existing local works has been examined to see how they cope with these conditions.
The general practice is to use two-stage sedimentation to handle the high loads. Water Company staff
have indicated that the existing tube settlers emploved in the second stage can satisfactorily handle
these loads but it is agreed to be prudent to install two-stage clarifiers for such waters.
Analy,tical results show significant levels of phenols to be present in the raw waters of the area. The
intakes have been located to avoid such problems and therefore no specific arrangements for phenol
removal are included in the works designs. It is believed that both here and in other areas of China
the analytical methods used tend to give high results at the verv low concentrations of interest.
All of the raw waters are found to be verv low or free of toxic metals and therefore no special
treatment for such problems are included.
Traditional Rapid Gravitv Filters. emploving water onlv washing have been found to perform only
moderatelv with turbiditv levels in the treated water falling wvithin the Chinese standard but being well
below western target levels (typicaliv O.5FTU). The Chinese recognise this failing and are keen to
use modern filters.
The general approach to the design of the water treatment works components is presented below.
There are necessarily some departures from this approach in specific cases. The experience and views
of the water companies have been taken into account both in the preparation of the standard approach
and in the specific designs.
B1.2 Coagulation
Coagulation jar testing has been carried out by the consultants for each of the water sources to provide
additional confirmation as to the optimum coagulation conditions and the settlement rates appropriate
for the clarifiers.
41367.EA.APPENDIXBI                         Bl - I                              DECEMBER 1998



SICHUAN UIRB1AN -FNVIRON\[EN r PRO)ECT                                  ENVIRONMENTALA SSESSMENT
Voluime 3 - Appendix B I
It is found that PAC, which is widely used as a primarv coagulant is satisfactorv for use on all of the
waters. PAM produced locally is used as a coagulant aid. This chemical in most situations is only
required during periods when SS concentrations are high but jar tests have shown it to assist in
increasing floc settling rates at other times. Facilities are therefore included at all works for the
dosinz of PAM.
B1.3 Flocculation
Hydraulic. -up-and-over" baffled flocculators are used exclusively throughout the area. All designs
prepared incorporate such units since thev are mechanically simpler and therefore cheaper and more
reliable than the mechanical alternatives.
B1.4 Sedimentation
Four different types of clarifier have been considered for use:
*  Horizontal flow clarifiers
*  Tube-settler clarifiers
  Radial flow circular clarifiers
*  Up-flow floc blanket clarifiers
Horizontal flow clarifiers are ty,picallv five times lar2er than tube settler clarifiers and consequentlv
considerably more expensive. Thev are also more difficult to desludge. Upon these bases the use of
horizontal clarifiers has not been considered.
Radial flow clarifiers are tvpicaliv tvo to three times larger than tube-settlers and are mechanicallv
complex. The higsh costs and maintenance requirements have led to a preference for tube settler units.
The only serious competition lies between upflow floc blanket clarifiers and tube-settlers for the
secondarv clarification dutv. The UFBCs are tvpicallv twice the size of the tube-settlers but can be
constructed as simple rectangular tanks. Their main merit is that desludging is simple and reliable.
One problem experienced in the west with tube settlers is the poor distribution of water across the
tube bundles. This aspect has been studied by MM  specialists at the existing works. Distribution
across the bundles has been observed to be satisfactorv in all cases and it is believed that the better
Chinese experience is related to the use of '5 mm as opposed to 50 mm tubes. The greater headloss
with the smaller tubes will Lndoubtedlv improve distribution.
There is no experience in the operation of UFBCs in the area and for this reason all of the water
companies prefer to use the tube-settler units which thev know well. Since these are tvpicallv a little
cheaper the decision has been made to use such units throughout.
B1.5 Rapid Gravitv Filters
The Chinese have developed a wide range of filters with very inaenious features aimed at reducing
capital and operating costs. All of these filters are washed by water alone. This not only leads to the
41367.£A.APPENDIX11I                           Bl -2                                 DECEMBER 1998



SICHIIAN UrRBAN ENVIRONMv[ENT PRO.IECT                               ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
VolLileC 3- Appendix B I
use of excessive quantities of wash water but also is by no means as effective as air/water washing in
the cleaning of filters. The result of the poorer cleaning is that filter breakthrough, particularly at the
start of a filter run. is very common.
These limitations are now recognised throughout China and there is now a move to filters washed by
air and water. Except for the Luzhou Beijiao works air/water washed filters have been adopted as a
standard.
In the case of this Luzhou Works the SUEP project component involves the duplication of an existing
works. which employs the traditional filters. The components of the-existing works have already been
constructed with duplication using identical process components anticipated. This, together with an
extremely restricted and difficult site. has led to the decision to use the older tvpe of filters. The
Water Companv recognises the shortcomings of the design and intends to use modern filters for later
plants. Their experience of the existing works is satisfactory and they have no problem in meeting the
drinking water standards and therefore they are prepared to accept the slightly poorer performance
associated with the use of the older filter designs.
In all other works separate air water washing is planned since this is not only the most effective media
cleaning svstem but also the wash watet usage is low.
Where raw water is expensive. for example in Zigong, wash water recovery works are incorporated.
B1.6 Sludge Treatment and Disposal
In aeneral sedimentation sludges are to be discharged directlv back to the river. With the high flows
in the Yangtze and the Qingyi this will create no problems. In the case of Zigong the sludge is to be
discharged to the Xushui River and in the drv season the flows are known to be low. The variability
of the low flows is not well known however.
In these circumstances it is planned to construct the wvorks with sludge discharge to the Xushui with
the intention of monitoring the effects on the river during the first drv season. If these effects are
found to be unsatisfactory the Water Companv has agreed to construct a sludge thickener and lagoons
to allow the retention of sludge until the river flows are high and provide sufficient dilution to permit
discharge.

Operatingt records at the wvorks in general indicate that present disinfection practice is effective both in
maintaining a residual in water going to supply and in controlling coliforms and e-coli to meet the
standards. In some cases. such as Zigong, chloramination is used and in others chlorination is used.
These two approaches are not considered to be inconsistent. In Leshan the Qinzvi is relatively free of
upstream industrial pollution whilst in Zigong both the present sources and the Min are likely to
contain traces of THM precursors. Under these circumstances the choice of disinfection method is
logical.
In the design of the new works the experience in the cities has been taken into account and the
relevant disinfection svstem selected.

In the use of chlorine. standard 'good practice" has been followed in the storage and handling of the
dangerous chemicals:
*  Chlorine drums are transported bv monorail crane with drums stored on secure ground
level rackinz.
*  Chlorine drum stores are weli ventilated with mechanical ventilation.
*  Weighers are to be incorporated in the drum store.
*  Vacuum chlorinators are to be imported from reputable suppliers and are to be located
together with associated ejectors and controls in a separate bay equipped with gas leak
detectors and alarms.
*  Chlorinators are to be automaticallv controlled to deliver a manually set dose
independent of the flow through the works.
*  Chlorine residual monitors are to be used and. since these are not always reliable, thev
will be backed up with manual sampling and laboratorv testing on site.
*  The suppiy of normal safety clothing and equipment. including emergencv breathing
-ear, will be included within the contract.
B1.8 Chemical Handling and Dosing
Ground level storage tanks are incorporated for the receipt of PAC. which is delivered in liquid form.
From these tanks the chemical solution will be pumped to dav tanks and thence by metering pumps to
the dosing points.
It is planned to import metering pumps with automatic speed control to permit dosing proportional to
flow and with manual stroke setting for the control of the dose.
PAMvi will be delivered in powder form in sacks. The small use rate for this chemical allows manual
char2ini of bags to feed hoppers to be adopted. Purpose built soiution preparation units will be
installed to allow effective solution of this pooriv soluble material.
Again variable speed. variabie stroke metering pumps will be used with the speed automatically
controlled to be proportional to flow and the dose set by stroke adjustment.
Carrier water will be used to dilute the concentrated solution so as to ensure no serious breakdown of
the polymer during transfer to the dosing point.

APPENDLX B2
THE APPROACH TO WASTEWATER TREATMENT
B2.1   Introduction
Under the SUEP wastewater treatment for four of the cities has been considered. The capacities of the
works do not reflect the total flow of wastewater produced but rather what can be included as an
affordable package within this first stage of the SUEP.
The works considered include the following:
*      Chengdu WwTW                            300 000 m;/d   ADWF
*      Zigong WwTW                             120 000 m3/d   ADWF
*      Leshan WwTW                             100 000 m'/d   ADWF
*      Deyang WwTW                             120 000 m3/d   ADWF
In preparing process designs for these works an attempt has been made to standardise but also to
reflect the preferences of the individual cities. In the sections below the background to the process
selection is presented.
B2.2 Sewage Flows
The flows quoted above represent the nominal capacities of the works evaluated. In manv cases the
supporting sewerage will have a larger design capacity to accommodate future flows. Nominal flows
and spills are summarised beiow in Table B2.1

It can be seen that the flowvs for Chengdu. Deyang and Leshan are based upon the sewerage system
being completely separate. This is not quite the case for these cities: Chengdu is now completely
separate for the area to be served: Deyang and Leshan are not fuliv separated but good progress has
been made and it is judged to be more sensible to design for separated sewers.

In Zigong the unusually high peak flow to the treatment works reflects the cities recognition that
sewage may be weaker than expected. in which case the designed works will satisfactoriiv handle the
higher flows.

SICHUAN IRBA,-I ENVIRONMENT PROJECT                              ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Volume 3 - Appendix B2
A number of aspects require comment:
Ammonia              Ammonia is toxic to fish and creates an oxygen demand equal to 4.3 times
the ammonia nitrogen content. The plants are designed to achieve an effluent
quality of 10 mgJI ammonia for 90% of the time. The average effluent
concentration is expected to be about 3 mg/l.  In operating the plants
sufficient air must be supplied to the aeration tanks to maintain a DO of
2 mg/l otherwise oxidation of ammonia will not be achieved. With correct
operation the works as designed will meet ammonia standards and the
specified percentage removal rates.
Suspended Solids    The standard calls for a suspended solids level of 20 mg/l in the treated
effluent. Such a performance cannot be achieved by use of any secondary
treatment works since the carry-over of solids from the final tanks will
normally exceed this value.
In order to achieve such a performance it would be necessary to construct a
tertiarv treatment works to follow the secondarv works. For large schemes
such as Chenzdu, rapid gravitv filters would be used at a filtration rate of 8
in/h. The merits of installing such tertiary filters have been examined in
Section B2.4.1 below and thev have been found to have a low benefit/cost
ratio. The conclusion is that one would do better to spend monev on
sewerage and secondary treatment than on tertiarv treatment.
For this reason no tertiarv works are included in the project and a treated
effluent SS of 30 mg/I has been adopted for design purposes. This approach
is the same as that adopted for the existing works and the works under
construction at Sanwayao.
COD                  The COD determined from analvsis of the wastewater in the sewers to the
Chengdu works is very high. at 658 mg/I. All processes used for the
treatment of municipal wastewater rely upon the biological degradation of
organic matter.  The COD  associated with the biologically degradable
organic matter will be removed but the processes will not remove the COD
associated with biologically non-degradable organics. For example dying
wastes contain hiah levels of COD which is not biologically de-radable. If
the wastewater delivered to any of the works includes high concentrations of
such materials the removal rates and the COD concentrations in the treated
eftluent will not meet the standards quoted in Table B2.2 above.
When such conditions are experienced. it will be necessarv to identifv the
factories discharging wastewater with a hi-h COD/BOD ratio and require
that thev should treat their discharges to achieve the COD standards quoted
above. It is never economic to install expensive processes such as activated
carbon adsorption for the whole of the waste water in order to remove COD.
It is alwavs cheaper to handle COD problems within the factories.

SICHUAN URBAN ENVIRONNiENT PROJECT                               ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Vol ume 3 - Appendix B2
For this reason no attempt has been made to design the works to meet the
COD requirements shown in Table B2.2.
Nitrogen as a nutrient Ammonia. nitrite and nitrate provide a source of inorganic nitrogen in waters
and these chemicals serve as kev sources of nutrient for alzae growth. In the
study of the impact of polluting discharges upon the fisheries of Han2zhou
Bay it was identified that the toxic "Red Tides' observed in Han-zhou Bay
and the East China Sea were favoured in a particular range of silica/nitrogen
ratios. It was further found that problems could become severe if nitrogen
discharges increased by more than about 50%. The Yangtze River was found
to be by far the largest source of nitrogen discharged to the fishery areas. It is
sensible within this project to take into account the recommendation of the
Hanzzhou Bay Study that:
Nitrogen discharges to the Yangtze should be controlled so as not to
exceed year 2000 levels.
Most modern treatment works include facilities for oxidation of ammonia to
nitrate and in such works partial denitrification. is reliably and cheaply
achieved. It is proposed therefore to design works to meet a standard of
10 mIl ammonia N on all occasions. This means that for most of the time
the ammonia N concentration will be below 5 mg/l. With the ammonia N
and Total N contents of raw wastewater typically 25 and 40 mg/I it will be
possible for most of the time to reduce the total nitrogen content bv about
iO maj'l. While no special measures are to be incorporated for removal of
nitrogen. the processes selected are expected to achieve about 25% removal
of total nitrogen. This complies with recommendations of the Hangzhou Bay
Study aimed at protection of the marine environment.
Phosphorous as a nutrient
Phosphorus removal is only required if the receiving water is to enter a lake
where conditions favour the growth of aigae. In this case the oniv lake will
be that formed by the Three Gorges Project.  It is understood that the
retention time of water in the reservoir will be short and therefore the risk of
algae formation is low.
In Table B2.3 the sources of the nutrients. nitrogen and phosphorus. within
the Yanatze basin upstream of the reservoir is shown. These data are taken
from the COWI Working Paper No.3. April 1997. Added to the table are the
contributions from the SUEP Project cities.
It can be seen that these cities contribute only 10 % of the nitrogten generated
in the basin and 2 % of the phosphorus.
With a conventional secondary wastewater treatment works one expects to
remove about 30 % of the inoreanic nitrogen.
41367.EA.APPENDIXB2                        B2-4                               DECEMBER 1998



0ICHUAN URBAN ENVIRONMIENT PROJECT                               ENVIRONNIENTAL ASSESSMENT
Volumc 3 - Appendix B2
It is concluded therefore that there is no point in constructing works to
remove phosphorus and the normal removal of inorganic nitrogen will
eventuallv reduce the nitrogen load contributed by the cities from 10 % to-
about7%.
In Figure B2.1 estimates of the sources of pollution in the Yangtze. prepared
by MM for the Hangzhou Bay Studv and COWI. are presented. The MM
studv covered the entire Yangtze basin whilst that of COWI covered the
basin upstream of Chongqing. Whilst such evaluations cannot be precise the
two independent studies reach similar conclusions:
*  The main source of pollution by nutrients arises from rural activities -
particularly the use of fertilisers and the generation from livestock.
*  Both sets of data indicate that if there is a need to control nutrient
discharges then one must control the agricultural sources.
In the light of these findings. which corroborate the world Bank views as
expressed in Section 3, Annex 3 of the Aide-Memoire covering the Mission
visit on May 6 to 8. designs have been prepared without facilities for
phosphorus removal but oxidation of ammonia has been included.
The standard followed in preparing designs is that shown in Table B2.2 above.
B2.4  Treatment Process Selection
Whilst the Chinese standards imply that secondary biological treatment of wastewater should be used
there is. in principle. the alternative of using primary treatment alone or indeed secondary treatment
followed bv tertiary treatment. Clearly for a given sum of monev one could choose to treat a high
flow of wastewater by primarv treatment or a lower flow by secondary treatment and a lower flow
still if tertiary treatment is included. In Section B2.4. 1 below the economic merits of these alternative
degrees of treatment are examined.
B2.4.1 The Degree of Treatment
As seen above a plant capacitv of I 00 000 m'/d DWF is a sensible basis to use in the comparison of
alternatives.
Three process options have been considered as described below:
Secondarv Treatment An extended aeration process has been adopted. without use of primary
clarifiers or anaerobic sludge digestion but with a lona retention time in the
aeration tanks so that the sludge can be well stabilised prior to dewatering
and disposal to landfill.

Voltnic 3- Appendix B'
The raw sewage quality is taken as:    BOD = 00 mg/l;
Ammonia = 25 mg/l
The treated effluent qualitv is taken as; BOD  20 mg/I;
Ammonia = 5 mg/l
The "benefit" of the process can be measured in terms of the reduction in
"Oxvyen Demand" discharged where:
OD = BOD + 4.3*(NH4-N)
The reduction in OD can therefore be estimated as:
180 mgil + 4.3*20 me/l = 266 mg/l
When related to a works capacity of 100 000 m3/d the OD removed becomes
26.6 t/d.
In Table B2.4. the design parameters for the process are shown together with
the estimates of capital and operating costs. These are as follows:
Capital Costs        161.81 M-
Operating Costs      6.79 MY pa
Primarv Treatment  The primarv treatment works will have identical pre-treatment to that used
for secondarv treatment. including: coarse screening, inlet lift pumping. fine
screening and arit removal. Primarv clarification tanks are included with the
sludge removed. dewatered and discharged to landfill.
The raw sewage quality is again taken as:  BOD = 200 mg/l.
Ammonia = 25 mg/I.
The treated effluent qualitv will be:      BOD = 128 mg/l.
Ammonia = 25 mg/I.
In this case the removal of OD is 72 mg/l or 7.2 t/d.
In Table B2.5 the main process design parameters are shown together with
the estimates of capital and operating costs. These costs can be seen to be as

Tertiary Treatment  Tertiary treatment can be provided by rapid gravity filtration of secondary
effluent. The outline. design and costings have therefore been prepared upon
the basis of the marginal additional cost and benefit of using tertiary
treatment by rapid gravity filtration at 8 m/h.
The Secondarv Sewage Qualitv is taken as:   BOD = 20 mgIl.
Ammonia= 5 mg/l
SS = 30 mg/I
The treated effluent qualitv will be:       BOD = 10 mg/I,
Ammonia = 5 mg/I.
SS= 10mg/I.
The reduction in OD can therefore be estimated as:
(20 - IO) msz/1 = IO mg-/I
This is equivalent to a reduction in OD of 1.0 t/d.

It can be seen from the Benefit I Cost ratio presented in the table that secondarv treatment has a clear
economic benefit over the option of using primary treatment alone and also over the option of adding
a tertiary treatment stage, to follow secondarv treatment. This greater benefit has led to the selection
of secondarv treatment of wastewater for all cases in the SUEP with the exception of Leshan where
there are special reasons why the construction of full secondary treatment works has been delaved to
the second stage of the SUEP.
B2.4.2 The Secondarv treatment Processes
There are a number of treatment processes which can be used to achieve the treated effluent standards.
In preparing this "Approach to Treatment' the following are the main factors which have been
considered:
X  The experience and wishes of the user     -      USER
*  Efficiency in power consumption           -      POWER
*  Reliability and ease of maintenance       -      EASE
*  Sludge disposal aspects                   -       SLUDGE
*  The Environmental Impact of the works   -         EIA
*  The Costs of the works                    -       COST
Three basic processes have been adopted following full discussions betwreen the users. their
consultants and the DRA consultants:
* Conventional Activated Sludge: with Fine Bubble Diffused Aeration (FBDA), and
sludge digestion and dewatering prior to disposal for agricultural use and/or to landfill
with the recovery of power bv use of digester gas as a fuel in diesel engines.
* Extended Aeration: using FBDA. without primary settlement or anaerobic sludge
digestion but with sludge dewatering prior to disposal to landfill.
* Extended Aeration: using brush aerators in a "race-track' tank, without primarv
treatment or anaerobic sludge digestion but with sludge dewatering prior to disposal to
landfill.

Outline designs have been prepared for each of the three above processes at a capacity of
100 000 m;/d and a standard set of conditions. Designs have been prepared using the MM process
spreadsheet.  This will not give precisely the same design criteria as derived for "Preliminarv
Designs" since it provides basic minimum requirements for the works without employing throughout
sensible safety margins. The designs produced do how provide a good basis for comparison and cost
estimates.
The outline designs prepared have been used as the basis for estimating both capital and operating
costs. Cost estimates for the three options are presented in Tables B2.8 to B2.10. The results from
these tables are summarised below in Table B2. I 1.

It can be seen that the Extended Aeration activated sludge system  is slightly cheaper than the
conventional activated  sludge system  with  power recovery and considerably  cheaper than the
Oxidation ditch with brush aerators. However the project cost is not the only factor to be taken into
account in the selection.

The EAS with FBDA has the advantage that the more complex anaerobic sludge digestion facilities
are avoided but high power efficiency is maintained by using FBDA.

VolurMe 3 - Appendix B2
Deyang prefer to accept a less efficient aeration system in order to simplifyv operation and
maintenance. Discussions have been held between MM and one of the major western contractors
experienced in this process - Kruger (OTV). They have agreed that. in viewv of the industrial
wastewater content of the sewage, it would be prudent and satisfactorv to install an anoxic zone at the
inlet to the oxidation ditch as a means of reducing the potential for the production of bulking slud-e
In Chengdu there is experience of operatina anaerobic digesters. Problems have been experienced at
Sanwavao due to inadequate mixing. Chengdu wish to continue with anaerobic digestion and. with
the opportunitv to purchase well proven M & E equipment from the west (with strong performance
guarantees), thev are confidant that the benefits of the process will be realised. The key benefits of
the system are that power is generated from waste and the sludge will be suitable for use on
agricultural land.
The SUEP Phase I scheme does not include power generation. Following a period of operation of the
Phase I works, when the gas production rates are confirmed and the calorific value of the gas is
established. the Chengdu WW  Companv plan to install gas engines coupled to power generation
plant. This approach has been evaluated and presented in the Chengdu feasibility report. It is shown
that the power that can be generated will be about 2200 kW.
The decision to use conventional activated sludge secondarv treatment. sludge digestion and power
recoverv is supported bv four factors:
*  Chengdu will be able to safely emplov sludge for agricultural use.
- After a period of operation to establish the gas production rate that can be consistentlv
achieved. Chengdu plan to install CHP plant in order to further increase the energy
efficiencv of the works. A major poNver saving estimated to be 2200 kW will be
achieved.
-  Having achieved successful operation of the new works Chengdu will be in a position to
emplov the works as a training centre for anaerobic digestion so that others in the
Province and elsewhere in China will be able to realise the benefits of the process.
* This process is probablv the one with greatest environmental benefit: it will be reliable
and efficient as a means of effluent treatment: it will create negligible odour problems: it
will produce a sludge that is safe to use on agricultural land.
The reasons for the individual cities to prefer the different options are considered valid. After all if
there was a clear favourite the above range of processes would not have been used elsewhere.
Whilst treatment for some of the cities mav be delaved to Stage 2 of SUEP it is believed that the
above treatment selections are technicaliv satisfactorv and reflect the sensible views of the operators.

Volumc 3 - Appendix B2
B2.4.3 Process Flowsheets and Calculations
For each of the cities the SWMEDRIC have produced the designs for the WwTWs. These have been
checked by MM using their normal design spreadsheets. For each of the Appraisal reports a
simplified flowsheet has been produced and the MM spreadsheet has been included in Appendices. In
checking designs precise agreement is never achieved. but the main process design parameters have
been confirmed in all cases bv MM and these have then formed the basis of the detaiied designs.
B2.5   Operation During Power Failures
During power failures and without standby power generation facilities, the qualitv of wastewater
entering the rivers will deteriorate. In all cases the raw wastewater will not be able to enter the
treatment works since the inlet lift pump station will not be able to deliver flows to the works.
The provision of standbv power generating facilities has been considered but the high cost of large
generators has led to the decision to omit such facilities. An adverse environmental impact will be
experienced during power failures in that some flow of untreated wastewater will enter the river. At
times of drv weather flow. storage will exist in the sewage mains and this will serve to limit
discharges to the river. During wet weather conditions the sewage is weak and river flows are
normallv high. Both of these factors serve to reduce the impact of discharges during power failure.
It is not normal practice to install standbv power supply facilities for either sewage pump stations or
treatment works in the west. This practice has been followed on the SUEP project and it is recognised
that some deterioration in river water qualitv will occur during periods of power failure.
B2.6   Odour Control
Pooriv designed or poorly operated wastewater treatment works can create serious odours and if there
are people living nearby justifiable complaints arise.
Odours occur to a minor extent on all sewage works but serious odour problems normally arise for the
following reasons:
*  Where raw Xwastewater is exposed for extended periods and/or hot conditions.
*  Where primarv tanks are desludged too infrequently.
*  Where areation systems fail or where aeration tanks are supplied with too little air.
  Where raw sludge is left exposed to the atmosphere.
The works proposed have been designed so as to avoid serious odour problems if thev are operated
properlv. The following features have been incorporated to minimise odour problems:
*  Frequent automatic desludging of primarv tanks can be carried out at Chengdu. At other
cities primary treatment is omitted and raw sewage is delivered directlv to aerated tanks.
*  The holding of primary sludge has been kept to a minimum and the use of belt presses
allows prompt dewatering.

Volume 3 - Appendix B2
*  Sludge is digested at Chengdu and exposed to aerobic stabilisation at the other cities
prior to dewatering and stackinc for disposal. Cleariy it is important to remove sludge
from the works as quickly as possible and the appropriate transport is provided in the
project to allow this to be done.
*  Adequate aeration facilities are provided to ensure that aeration tanks are alwavs
adequately aerated.
*  Works have been sited. as far as possible, remote from population centres.
The practice where works have to be built close to population centres is to enclose and mechanically
ventilate areas where odours are most likely to arise. The ventilated gases are treated for odour
removal. There are a range of odour treatment methods which can be used. All are verv expensive
and conditions on the sites selected for the SUEPO works are such that the incorporation of these
methods has been judged to be unnecessary providing the works are operated correctly.
It would be sensible to plant greenerv around the sites and this is incorporated within the designs.
It is understood that problems have been experienced at Sanwavao WwTW at Chengdu. It is
suspected that difficulties experienced with digestor mixing and consequent operation of digesters at
low temperatures has led to the production of incompletelv digested sludge. The storage of such
sludge before disposal would be expected to create problems. It is important that such problems are
avoided on the new works.
B2.7  Septic Tank Sludges and Nightsoil
Traditionally in China. nightsoil has been kept separate from other household water-bome wastes
(grey water) and has been removed from the home bv bucket and applied to farming land. Grey water
hias been discharged through septic tanks to the nearest watercourse by open or closed channels.
As the present enormous cities have been developed this practice has become increasingly
unacceptable: it has become more and more difficult to transfer the nightsoil to the farms and there
has been an increasingz reluctance by farmers to emplov this form of fertiliser when chemical
fertilisers became available.
Since the present practice is not well understood five cities were asked to provide information on their
disposal practice. Three replies were received: from Leshan. Luzhou and Zigyong. The replies are
presented in Table B2.13.
The response from  Luzhou and Zigong are useful.  Despite a fairly wide coverage of sewer
connections a high percentage of the population are served by septic tanks. Septic tanks only appear
to be emptied every two to three vears or even less frequently. From the responses in Table B2.8 it
appears that most of the tanks at any one time are full and therefore much of the water-borne solids
already discharge to the sewers to which the tanks are connected. In Zigong it appears that septic tank
sludge largely goes to agricultural land whilst in Leshan it goes to landfill.

It appears that separate night soil disposal is still occurring to a significant degree with buckets
emptied in the public toilets. These public toilets are usually equipped with septic tanks and again
sludge is normally discharged to landfill or to agriculture.
When considering the future situation it is unlikely to be long before all of the population are using
flush toilets in wvhich case both "grev" and "black" waste will go to existing septic tanks and then to
the sewer.  It can be seen that already emptying of tanks is not effective and one must therefore
anticipate. and plan. for the discharge of the whole sewage to the sewer.

With the domestic water consumption rising gradually to 200 I/c/d and tvpical per capita production
rates for BOD, SS and ammonia 50. 60 and 8 =/c/d respectivelv the likelv future strength of domestic
sewaize will approximately be:

SUMMARY of SUEP SCHEMES
for
PRE -APPRAISAL
1.0 BACKGROUND
This report provides a summary of nine feasibilitv study reports, covering Phase I of the long term
Sichuan Urban Environmental Project, prepared by SUEPO for Pre-Appraisal by the World Bank.
The World Bank, at the request of the Sichuan Provincial Government, has agreed in principle to
provide a loan towards the Sichuan Urban Environment Project. The project will cover a range of
measures including engineering and institutional support works for water supply, water pollution
control and solid waste management for a number of cities in the Tuo and Min River Basins.
The State Planning Commission in December 1997 agreed the application of such a loan, with a limit
of 5150 million, to a number of works.
In 1997 a team of International Consultants. Mott MacDonald. supported by a grant from the UK
Government, came to Sichuan to assist the SUEP Project Office in the preparation of the project for
detailed evaluation by the World Bank Team.
Following an overall evaluation the following components. illustrated diagrammatically in the Annex,
have been identified by SUEPO for preparation by the above combined team:
Water Suppiv Schemes
* Leshan
* Luzhou Beijiao
* Luzhou Daxikou
. Zigong
Water Pollution Control Schemes
*  Chengdu
* Deyana
* Leshan
*  Zi2onu
Municipal Solid Waste Schemes
* Leshan
This report. prepared by the SUEP Project Office. summarises the feasibility studies of the nine
schemes proposed and has been prepared for Pre-Appraisal by the World Bank and is supported by a
number of docurments:

2.3 The Proposed Water Supply Works
Outline details of the main components of the schemes are shown in the following Table C.3. The
two schemes for Luzhou each have a capacitv of 50 000 m3/d. The capacitv of the Leshan scheme is
100 000 m7d. whilst that for Zigong is 200 000 m /d. The Luzhou Beijiao scheme involves the
supply of '5 000 m/d to Fuji, a countv town some 35 km  north of Luzhou.  The Zigong scheme
involves the suppiv of 210 000 m;/d of raw water but treatment works for onlv 120 000 m3/d with
so 000 m'/d of raw water to suppiv an existing treatment works.

2.5   Economic and Financial Analvses
The main economic and financial indicators for the schemes and the water utilities are summarised in
Table C.5.
The AICs for Zigong are unusually high because 40 % of raw water is fed to an existing WTW  and
therefore costs have been set against only 60%  of the flow. Whilst those for Luzhou - Beijiao are
high due to costs of the pipeline to Fuji.

All schemes have been found to be affordable when personal costs incurred. based upon the tariffs
generated bv utilitv level analvsis. are compared with the lower 10 percentile incomes. Willingness to
pav survevs indicate that a high percentage are prepared to pav for improved services and the tariffs
proposed appear to be acceptable.

5.0 THE SOCIAL ANALYSIS
The social impact of the project has been considered upon the basis of data collected from
willingness-to-pas survevs. resettlement action plans and information froni the citv.
In all of the cities it was found that people had a high degree of awareness of the importance of public
health issues and a good understanding of the links between environmental conditions and health. A
high proportion of those interviewed expressed a willingness to pa,y for services but quantitative
results. in the most part. were not obtained. Quantitative data on willingness to pav in Chengdu has
had to be used as a basis for assessments elsewhere.
Social behaviour. gender issues, household income patterns, health and needs for social awareness
have been covered for each of the five cities.

7.0 THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
The EA is in the course of preparation and is on schedule for submission to the World Bank one
month in advance of the Appraisal of the SUEP.
The project components are all identified as having overall beneficial impacts.
No overriding issues have been identified to date. Concerns have been raised on a number of issues
and have been addressed with modification of designs wvhere appropriate. Normal issues have been
raised relating to the civil construction with requirements presented to minimise the impacts of
construction traffic. noise and air-borne dust.
In the operation of works concerns have been expressed regarding noise and the performance of
works during power failures. The treatment and disposal of watenvorks sludae has been covered.
Mitigation measures to minimise adverse impacts have been identified and monitoring requirements
have been detailed to ensure the environmental aims are achieved.

8.0 INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS
Institutional anaivses have been conducted to establish the needs to be able to achieve sustainable
operation and management of the utilities to be responsible for the works to be funded under the
World Bank loan.
Proutress with the formation of the new utilities to cover wastewater works has been slow. Proposals
have been prepared bv the cities but considerably more preparation work is necessary with detailed
attention given to the structure, responsibilities. working methods, staffing, assets. financial
management and institutional strengthening needs.
We are confident that this work can be completed and be ready for Appraisal within three months. It
remains to prepare the legal documentation. required bv the World Bank, to cover the establishment
of the new companies.
Preliminarv assessments of institutional strengthening needs have been identified.
9.0 PROJECT COST SUMMARY
In Table C. 14 the capital costs for all engineering components and the Technical Assistance are
combined to give a total cost for the SUEP Phase I.
10.0 FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY
In Table C. 15 the bases for economic and tinancial analyses are summarised and the main indicators.
for the project components are summarised.
11.0 TECHNICAL ASSISTA±NCE
Details of the requirements for technical assistance have yet to be finalised.
12.0  OUTSTANDING MATTERS
The following major aspects require further attention before Appraisal: minor aspects are listed in
each feasibility study:
*  A number of engineerin2 survevs are vet to be completed. Following the receipt of
results the precise pipe routes and/or site locations should be established. Impacts upon
the designs. costs. resettlement requirements and the EA will be reviewed.
*  The new companies to handle wastewater must be formally created and all legal
documentation must be prepared. Further definition of the roles. responsibilities, assets.
liabilities and facilities for the new companies will be provided.

D.2 INTEGRATED WASTEWATER DISCHARGE STANDARD
Issued by the state Technique Supervision Bureau in 1996-10-04. Into force 1998-01-01
Preface
This standard is a revised edition of GB 8978-88. " 1ntearated Wastewater Discharge Standard". The major
revised scope is: proposed a vear-limit standard instead of the classification of existing enterprises and new
(or reconstructed or extended) enterprises. The year-limit standard indicates two period sections which
means the enterprises constructed before 1997-12-31 must follow the standard in first period section and the
enterprises constructed after 1998-01-01 must follow the standard in second period section.
For the application range of this standard. it has been defined that the integrated discharge standard can not
be implemented alternately with trade discharge standard, thus the wastewater from paper making industries,
shipping industries. sea petroleum development. textile and dyeing & finishing industries, meat processing
industries, synthetic ammonia industries. iron-steel industries, weapon industries, phosphorus fertilizer
industries. etc. must comply with corresponding trade discharge standard, and the wastewater from other
enterprises or institutions must compiv with this standard. Except the enterprises mentioned above, there
included 1 7 trade discharge standards that have been issued before.
Compared with original standard. the standard values of this standard in the first period section are same
with original values. In order to control the pollutants discharged from 17 trades whom wastewater discharge
standard have been revised in this standard. IO parameters have been added into this standard. At the second
period section, 40 parameters have been added and the highest allowable concentrations of COD. BOD, etc.
are stricter than original standards.
This standard will go into effect from the date of 1998-01-01 and the following standards will be replaced:
GB8978-88 lntezrated WasteNvater Discharge Standard
GBJ48-83 Hospital Wastewvater Discharge Standard
GB3545-83 Wastewater Discharge Standard for Beet Sugar Refinerv Industrv
GB3546-83 Wastewater Discharge Standard for Cane Sugar Refinery Industrv
GB3547-83 Industrial Pollutant Discharge Standard for Synthetic Fatty Acid Industrv
GB3548-83 Industrial Pollutant Discharge Standard for Svnthetic Detergent Industrv
GB3549-83 Wastewater Discharge Standard for Leather Making Industrv

Volume 3 - Appendix D
This standard is specially drawn up to implement the Chinese Environmental Protection Law, Chinese Water
Pollution Control Law and Chinese Sea Protection Law. control the water pollution. protect water quality in
rivers. lakes. streams, reservoirs and seas. ensure human health. maintain the ecosystem and promote the
development of state economv and urban construction.
1.     The main components and application range of the standard
1.1    Main components
The standard includes the highest allowable discharged concentrations of 69 parameters and the
highest allowable water discharge amount for some trades.
1.2    Application range
The application range of the standard is wastewater discharge management, EIA, design for
construction. supervision and monitoring.
According to the implementation principal of this integrated discharge standard of which the
integrated discharge standard can not be implemented alternatelv with trade discharge standard. the
wastewater from paper making industries. shipping industries. sea petroleum development. textile
and dyeing & finishing industries, meat processing industries, svnthetic ammonia industries. iron-
steel industries. weapon industries. phosphorus fertilizer industries. etc. must comply with
corresponding trade discharge standard. and the wastewater from other enterprises or institutions
must comply with this standard.
1.3    After this standard issued, the trades which have the new wastewater discharge standard must
comply with corresponding discharge standard and do not impiement this standard.
2.     Other standards quoted in this standard
Besides the standard parameter values used in this standard the following other standard are quoted
in this standard:
GB3097-82 Sea water qualitv
GB3838-88 Surface water quality
GB8703-88 Regulation of radiation protection
3.     Definitions
3.1    Wastewater: means the water dischareed from production processes and living activities.
3.2    Water discharee amount: means the amount of water discharged from production processes. which
do not cover coolina water. boiler water and outlet from hydropower stations.
3.3    All wastewater discharge institutions: means the institutions are covered in this standard.
3.4    Other wastewater discharge institutions: means the institutions excepted the trades listed in this
standard.?
4.     Technical scope
4.1    Classification
4.1.1   Wastewater discharged to class Ill surface water (GB3838-88) or to class 2 seawaters (GB3097)
must comply with the class I wastewater discharge criteria this standard

4.2. 1.2 Class 2 pollutants (table 2) means that wastewater quality should meet the standard parameter values
at the point of wastewvater outlet.
4.2.2  This standard stipulates the highest allowable concentrations for class I and class 2 pollutants and
highest water discharge amount for some trades according to the year-iimit standard:
4.2'.1 For constructions before 1997-12-3 1 the wastewater pollutants should meet the criteria in table 1.2.3.
4.2.2.2 For constructions after 1998-01-01 the pollutants should meet the criteria in table 1.4 and 5.
4.2.2.3 The date of construction is the date in the EIA report.
4.3    Other regulations
4.3.1  If two or more outlets occur to the same river station. then the discharge standard should follow
Appendix A to calcuLiate.
4.3.2  The highest allowable pollutants discharge load for the industry can be calculated according to
Appendix B.
4.3.3   The annual total amount of discharged pollutant can be calculated according to Appendix C.
4.3.4   Radioactive vastewater should follow both this standard and GB8703-88.
S.     Monitoring
5. I    Sampling station
Sampling stations should be located according to the regulations of class land 2 pollutants discharge
outlet described in 4.2.1 .1 and 4.2. 1.2. The wastewater outlet should be marked and water flow meters
should be equipped.

5.2    Sampling frequencv
Wastewater sampling frcquencv is determined according to industrial production period. If the
production period is in 8 hrs the sampling frequencv should be I time/ 2 hrs. and if the production period is
more than 8 hrs the sampiing frequency should be I .time / 4 hrs. For other kinds of wastewater. the sampling
frequency should be more than 2 times / 24 hrs. The highest allowable concentration should be calculated
according to dailv average concentration of pollutants.
5.3    Wastewater discharge value
The discharged volumes of wastewater are calculated according to the highest allowable water
discharge or lowest water recvcling rate usually in t / month.
5.4    Date statistics
The amount of (raw material and products) production should be statistic according to monthlv and
annual production reports.
5.5    Analytical methods
The analytical methods adopted in this standard are shown in table
6.     Supervision and enforcement of the standard
6.1    The standard is supervised and implemented bv the government above the countv level (including
county government).
6.2   If this standard can not improve local water qualitv when it is implemented. the provincial
{government can draw up local discharge standard which should be stricter than this standard in order to meet
surface water quality' standard, and should report to national government.

E 1.1 Positive Impacts (Local, Basin)
Fater Supply Quality and dAvailabilitv
Although Leshan is located at the junction of three major river svstems, the treated and
potable water supplv svstems are inadequate for current or projected needs of the City. The
per capita consumption is currently 148 l/dav (although the quantity available to consumers
may be much lower). and the urban service area is expanding.  The urban supply is
supplemented bv industries that also suppiv some domestic water. This project will supplv
criticaliv needed potable water which will allow the per capita availability to rise, the service
area to expand. and the exploitation of economic development opportunities.
Sanitation and Public Health
The supply of raw water from the Qingyi River will allow discontinuation of the use of the
Min River as a domestic water source. This eliminates a polluted source of water supply and
the attendant problems associated with treating this source water.  It will allow higher
baseflows to be maintained in the Min River through Leshan. and this will provide higher
flows for dilution of domestic and industrial discharges.
Economic Development
The supply of adequate municipal water is a minimum need for allowing the city to grow and
develop economically into the future.
E 1.2  Potential Short Term Construction Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 1.2.1 Impacts
Relocation and Compensation
The Leshan water project will require 94 mu of land. 4 mu for the intake and 90 mu for the
WTW. Onlv one household will require resettlement. No people will require new
emplovment. The RAP includes cost for the temporary and permanent land. temporarv and
permanent agricultural damage. and demolition cost. The compensation and resettlement plan
will be implemented by City municipal government.
Demolition/Spoils
There is minimum demolition required for this project component and the issue has been
covered in the RAP for the project. As the plant site has been levelled before the project
constructionl. no problems of arable land loss. vegetation damage and notable soil erosion.
While the construction of intake will cause some land loss and vegetation damage. For the
intake station construction. 4 mu (0.26 ha) of land (non-arable land) will be purchased. 25
clumps of bamboo. 180 mulberrv trees. and 212 fruit trees will be cut down.
The construction of the raw water transmission main will occupy 930 m2 (1.5 mu) of
fishpond. The temporal land disturbance for it will involve 3.13 ha (1 7 mu) of land. damage
52 clumps of bamboo. 31 fruit trees and 46 clumps of grape.

SICI IUAN UR1BAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT                        ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Volume i - Appendix E
The project sites will be located at the juncture of urban and rural areas. No rare or preserved
animal or plant species at national or provincial protection level will be affected. No old or
larze trees are in the areas affected by the project construction. The sites are far from the
nature preserves and scenic spots. Therefore no adverse impact on them is expected during
construction.
During the project construction. spoil or debris will be generated during three stages:
(1) During the plant construction, some 40 000 m3 of spoil will be generated in the
excavation of sedimentation tanks. clean water reservoir and other tanks.
(2) During the intake construction. some 10 000 m- of spoil will be generated in ground
levelling.
(3) During the transmission main construction, about 1 800 m' of spoil will be
generated in pipeline laying.
A total of more than 51 800 m3' of spoil will be generated in the construction of the project.
According to the urban plan of Leshan city, a low-lving land of 3 km2 at Baivangba in the
northern suburb of the central district will be filled and levelled to a thickness of 1.9 m,
requiring a total of 5.7 million m; of soil and rock. Spoil and construction wastes will be
transported to this site which is about 4 - 5 km awav from the project sites. SRIEP has
inspected the disposal site and found no special environmental problems or issues related to
this proposed site.
Noise and Dutst
Heavv load trucks for transporting pipes are mobile and intermittent sources emitting
significant noise during pipe laying, with noise levels in the range of 85-90 dB(A). The noise
impact shoLild not be significant since they will only operate in the daytime. thev are less
frequent than vehicle flows on existing roadwavs. and the sites are not near urban areas. The
pipeline will be excavated using manual labour so dust and noise will be minimised.
Limiting construction to the daytime hours will mitigate noise problems. The pipeline will be
excavated using manual labour in many cases so dust and noise will be minimised. During
the construction operation of construction equipment and the running of vehicles will
generate noise. The noise levels will depend on the tvpes and numbers of machines and
vehicles. Generallv their noise ievels range from 80 to 90 dB(A). The construction noise will
have adverse impact on people living near the construction site or along the highway. In
order to meet the requirements specified bv Boundarv Noise Limits for Construction Sites
(GBI 2523-90)- night-timne construction activities will be prohibited. with the use of trucks
and equipment prohibited bv 23:00 hr each dav (except for road crossings which mav be
allowed to milimise daytime construction impacts).
If it is necessary to utilise groundwater pumps. thev will be provided with appropriate noise
and vibration protection devices. This will be especialiv important for night-time dewatering.
Mitigation measures will be required as well as monitoring.

SICHUAN URBAN ENVIRONMENT l'ROJECT                         ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Volume 3 - Appendix E
Management practices are recommended to minimise erosion and runoff from storage piles
and for site clean up after construction is compieted.
The proposed water treatment works will be located in the development zone of the citv.
There are residential areas about 100 m south-west of the WTW site. A 10 m high hill lies
between the WTW site and the residences and this provides a good sound barrier.
Construction noise should not significantlv affect the residents.
A sanatorium is located south of the intake site. separated bv a wall. The sanatorium area has
a long rectangular shape. from north to south. The residential area of the sanatorium lies in
the middle and southern parts of the building. The sanatorium has a small self-operated water
treatment wDrks at the northern end of its site. more than 100 m from its residential area.
West of the intake is the Qingyi River. Besides the sanatorium. no other noise sensitive
points are within 100 m of the intake site. In addition the site lies in a low hillv area not
beneficial to the propagation of sound. Thus the construction of the intake should not cause
significant adverse impact on the acoustic environment.
Dust emitted from house dismantling and building construction of the plant will have adverse
impact on the environment. In addition. activities such as pipe laving, earthwork and filling
also generate flying dust and cause air pollution. However. the impact of flving dust will be
temporary. localised and limited to the construction period.
Transportation
There are minimal road crossings required and operational and scheduling plans have been
developed to minimise traffic impacts. Noise concerns normaliv would limit construction to
the davtime but road crossines will be allowed at night to minimise traffic disruption on this
major highway.
Safety Issues
The pipe trenches will be excavated by hand through existing sand and gzravel strata that will
require wide. battered, trenches to protect against trench collapse. Strict safety measures will
be recommended.
Putblic Flacilities
A few rock carvings were noted along the walking path section of the pipeline route.
however. they are reported to not have anv si2nificance. Although the construction of the
intake and WTW has no measurable impact on public facilities. the laying of transmission
pipeline will disrupt 144 m2 of asphalt highway. 108 mz of concrete roadway leading to the
treatment plant. 300 locations of river slope protection. and 4 telecommunication facilitv
locations. The relative compensation plan has been drawn up.
Doniestic Wa.qstewcater
During the construction phase. about 200 workers will be working in the construction sites.
Except for some technical workers, most of them will be local residents. they will have their
existing places to eat and sleep.  Therefore no new domestic wastewater discharge is
expected. Technical workers will probably stav at small inns in adjacent towns or townships,
so no new pollution sources will be created.

E 1.3.1 Impacts
Noise
Noise will mainlk c.ome from the pumps and air blowers during operation. Thus. large noise
sources are likelv to be in concentrated in the water intake pump house. the water treated
water pump house. wastewater discharge pump house. and backwashi water recycle tank.
The equipment noise levels are generally in the range of 80 - 90 dB(A). Since most of the
equipment is installed inside builidings that are usually partly sunk into the ground. the impact
of noise on the external environment is likelv to be reduced. Oniv a few noise levels at the
intake station boundary- are predicted to exceed the standard value. but. no sensitive receptors
are located near the station. Noise levels 20 m from the intake station boundary are predicted
to be much lower. so no noise nuisance is likelv to occur. Boundary noise levels around the
treatment plant are not predicted to exceed the standard values and. furthermore. noise may
also not be a serious concern since the site is located in an industrial area.
However. appropriate low-noise equipment and noise control measures. such as sound
insulation. will be specified where necessarv. in order to reduce the noise level at source
down to below 70 - 90 dB(A) at a specified distance. Class B of the Boundarv Noise
Standard  for Industrial enterprises. GB 12348-90  and  Class B  of the  Urban  Regional
Environmental Standard. GB3096-93 will be met (this specifies a limit of 60 dB(A) in the dav
and 50 dB(A) at night).

Odoutrs
The only potential odour concern would follow breakdowns in normal operations and
chlorine gas leaks. This issue is covered under section 5.3.5.
Slvcle Treatnient and Disposcal
Silt and other inorganic matters will be settled out through pre-sedimentation. sedimentation,
clarification. and filtration. resulting in sedimentation sludge. Generally water flushing is
used to wash the sludge awav for discharge to the nearby river. The main content of the
wastewater is silt and inorganic suspended matters and their contents vary with the turbidity
of raw water, which is higher during high, wet season. flows.
As the silt content of Qing,vi River averages about 0.3 ki/ms. the daily sludge content of
wastewater from the plant will be 33.5 t/d at design flows and average conditions. During
wet season. flushing frequency is much higher than that in dry season owing to the hiaher silt
load and increased sludge accumulation rates. During the peak of the wet season, the
maximum sludge content of the wastewater from the water treatment works reaches about
6000 m-'ld. It decreases with the reduction of raw water silt content during the other seasons.
For the proposed project, it is estimated that the wastewater flow is 750 m'/d and 100 m;/d for
normal and low ftlow seasons respectivelv. The average annual wastewater discharge is 2 300
m'/d.
This wastewater produced by the WTW will be discharged via a pipe to the Qingyi River
without any treatment. The sludge will not accumulate and obstruct the river owing to the
river's high flow rate. Even in the drv season. the flow rate is 78 m'/s.
According to the annual monitorinz data collected bv the Jiajiang Hydrological Station
upstream of the proposed intake. the average suspended load is 0.294 k_/ m'. By calculation
the sludge dischar_es in different water seasons (based on design tlows) are as follows:
Water season         Average       Low water    Normal water           High water
Sludge discharge. t/d  6.58        0.77          20.53                 54.25
Normal water treatment works operation usually involves the discharge of sludge-containing
wastewater during a defined time duration. The following calculation will reveal the impact
of slud-e-containing wastewater on the Qingyi River.
High water season:
Slud2e discharge rate 54.25 t/d:
average flow rate of Qingyi Rover 610 m;/s:
discharge duration: I hour a day.
The siit content of Qingyi River will increase by 0.024 kg/m-. following discharge of the
WTW wastewater to the river. giving a combined silt content of 0.799 kg/mi. which is lower
than the maximum silt content of the river. The WTW wastewater from the proposed plant is
not considered to have an adverse impact on the Qingyi during the high flow season.

VoIurn 3 - Appendix E
Low water flow season:
Sludge discharge rate 0.77 t/d:
average flow rate of Qingyi river 78 m3/s;
discharge duration: 3 hours/day.
Based on the calculation. the silt content of Qingvi River will increase by 0.001 kI;m',
following discharge of the wastewater to the river. giving a combined silt content of 0.016
kg/m'. which is a little higher than the current maximum silt content of the river. The sludge
from the proposed plant will have no adverse impact on the water bodv in low water flow
season.
O&M Problems
Operation and maintenance presents problems in many Chinese public facilities due to a
variety of budgetarv, training, and equipment problems. The Leshan Nr. 3 WTW has been
inspected bv the design and EA team and found to be in good working order. In addition. this
project will include a large technical assistance program  to improve the equipment and
training of the water companv. The design will be state-of-the-art and O&M should not be a
problem as the project is currentiv formulated. Detaiied monitoring is specified to verify
performance objectives.
Chlorination - Saferv
The chlorination room consists of liquid chlorine dosing. chlorine leakage detection and
treatment. and liquid chlorine storage. Three vacuum chlorinators (Q=10 kg/h), 2 duty and I
standbv. Chlorine gas goes through an automatic switch device and then into chlorinators.
The dosage is generally 2 mg/l. which is controlled by a complex ring controller. One
month's suppiv of chlorine is stored in drums at the works.
The chlorine leakage treatment facility is a safety installation that is used to control accidents
occurring in the chlorine dosina room. It includes chlorine leakage alarm system, ventilation
svstem and neutralization system. It can treat anv accident due to chlorine leakage in time so
as to protect workers on dutv and the adjacent environment t'rom chlorine poisoning.
In order to prevent the occurrence of chlorine leakage. some detailed suggestions are put
forward in the following categories (details in component appendix):
(1)     Transportation. storage and application of liquid chlorine drums
(2)     Emergency procedures for chlorine leakage
Dotu.estic  usterIl rwer
35 new staff will be emploved in the plant during operation - producing domestic wastewater.
The main pollutants in domestic wastewater are BOD5. TSS and ammonia. Domestic
wastewater generated from the plant will be discharged to a septic tank with biogas generator.
After commissioning of phase one of the project (in the vear 2000), 100 000 m'/d of treated
water will suppiv the urban area of Leshan. Consumption of this water will generate an
estimated 80 000 mr'/d of municipal wastewater which will be discharged to the sewer system.
Without a sewage treatment system operating. the dailv BOD5 and COD discharges will be

12.8 t/d and 24 t/d, respectively. Those pollutants will ultimately enter the Min and have a
significant adverse impact on the water environment.
At present in Leshan most of domestic wastewater has a simple treatment by septic tanks, and
industrial wastewater is treated bv treatment faciiities inside the factories. Another SUEP
Phase I component project will improve the sewerage systems in the urban area of Leshan and
remove the wastewater to a location downstream  of the cirv and the Great Buddha.  This
phased project will be designed to allowv coinstruction  of a complete WwTW   in the future
under a subsequent phase of the SUEP. Therefore. the city is making plans for handling the
additional sewage that wvill be generated as a result of this potable water supply project.

E 2    Zigong Min River Diversion and WTW
E 2.1 Positive Impacts (Local, Basin)
Waxter Supplv OQualitv and Availabilitv
Zigona is situated on the Fuxi River in the southern part of the Tuo River basin. some 200 km
south of Chengdu. The city has deveioped around the confluence of Xushui and Weivuan
rivers that converge to the north west of the town tb form the Fuxi River.
Zigongi suffers from a general lack of water resources. from both the Xushui River and
Changfu Reservoir. The per capita consumption is currently only 75 I/dav. The urban supply
is supplemented bv industries that also supplv some domestic water. This project will supply
criticaliv needed potable water that will allow the per capita availability to rise. the service
area to expand. and increase economic development opportunities for the residents.
Sanitation wii,d Public Health
The transfer of raw water from the Min River will allow use of the Xushui River as a
domestic water source to be discontinued. This eliminates a polluted source of water supply
and the attendant problems associated with treating this source water.  It also allows
additional baseflow water to remain in the Xushui and Fuxi Rivers through Zigong, which is
needed for the convevance and dilution of other domestic and industrial wastewaters.
Economic Development
The suppiv of adequate municipal water is a minimum requirement to enable the citv to grow
and develop economicallv in the future
E 2.2  Potential Short Term Construction Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 2.2.1 Impacts
Relucation cand Land Acquisition
The pipeline route bypasses several small communities so the land losses and impacts occur
in mostlv rural agricultural areas. There will be both temporarv and long-term losses of
agricultural productivitv that have been addressed in the RAP.
The construction of intake pumping station involves resettlement of 45 households or 180
people and relocation of 5 993 m  of houses. No resettlement is involved for the construction
of intermediate pumping station. The total compensation is 33.38 million vuan. Relocatees.
whose income sources wvill be affected bv the project. will be provided with jobs sutficient to
keep their previous living standard. Although relocated farmers will suffer some temporal
negative impacts. their living conditions will be improved both in terms of income and
housing quality after the project completion. In order to compensate the losses. including
income and crop yields. brought bv temporary land. disturbance. some of the farmers will be
offered jobs working on the project construction. eaming sufficient income to maintain their
previous living standard. After completion of the project. all the temporarv land occupation
will be immediately reinstated and returned back to agriculture use.

Volunil i - .Appcrdiix E
Land proposed for acquisition consists entirely of farmland, which contains no residential
areas, factories. special protection zones or areas of natural scenerv which should be
safeguarded. When the WTW is constructed. the place will be re-designated from agricultural
area to urban factory buildings. The land acquisition for the WTW is for the construction of
public facilities. As long as the state and local government regulations are complied with.
compensation for land paid and residents well resettled. the land resources can be adequatelv
developed and utilised.
Demolition/Spoils
During the project construction some spoil wvill be generated including soils and rocks
abandoned in the process of laying the transmission main. Calculated by 2.Sm in depth and 3
- 6 m in width. the total volume of earthwork for transmission main component is about 760
000 m'. The majoritv of the excavated material will be re-used as back-fill around the pipe
and trench. It is planned to transport excess soil and rock (with an estimated total volume of
104 000 m3) to farmners who are building houses and to nearbv road construction sites. The
project unit will subsidise the transportation cost. SRIEP has reviewed the local plans for
disposal and found theft to be satisfactorv. There appear to be a significant number of sites
along the 66 km pipeline route where excess spoil could be used for roadway and other
construction. As such. there will be no designated storage or disposal locations. SRIEP and
the city EPB will ensure that spoil is not dumped into watercourses or other environmentally
sensitive locations.
Noise and Dust
In an urban noise assessment. SRJEP identified the urban area of Zigong as the monitorinc
range. Based on the finctional division. 7 points were selected as ambient noise level
monitoring points. A number of points exceed the standard during davtime. night-time or
both.
During construction the main noise sources are transportation vehicles. lifts. diggers. mixers.
and so on. Heavv load trucks for transporting pipes are strong noise source during pipe
laving. Thev belono to mobile and intermittent sources with sound pressure level in the range
of 85-90 dB(A). The noise impact can not be significant owing to davtime operation, less
vehicle flow on existing roadwavs. and far away from urban area. If it is necessarv to utilise
groundwater pumps. they will be provided with appropriate noise and vibration protection
devices. This will be especiallv important for night-time dewatering. Mitigation measures
will be required as well as monitoring.
Other anticipated problems are temporarv noise and dust but the lack of sensitive receptors or
residential areas minimises these impacts. Tailpipe emissions from heavv duty, diesel trucks.
which are used to transport pipes. building materials and mechanic equipment. are major air
pollutant sources. Those trucks xvill increase the air pollutant emission along roadways. It is
estimated that air impact of exhausting gases is not significant because of less transportation
quantity and not too manv vehicles.
Dust will be emitted bv house dismantling and construction of the works. Activities such as
pipe laying. earthworks and filling also generate flving dust and cause air pollution. But the
impact of tlvinz dust is temporarv and localised.

Transportation
To minimise relocations and destruction of agricultural land, much of the pipeline will be
installed in or adjacent to the existing road between Nixi and Zigong. This roadwav is very
narrow and confined in many locations. It will be necessary to permanently widen the
roadwav and/or construct temporary roads to maintain traffic flow during the construction
period. Noise concerns normaliv would limit construction to the daytime but road crossings
will be allowed at night to minimise traffic disruption on this highwav.
Safey Issutes
The pipe trenches will be excavated by hand except in rock. When the stratum consists of
sand and gravel materials. they will require wide trenches in order to protect against trench
collapse. Strict safety measures will be recommended.
Public Facilities
There are minimum impacts to public facilities but there are a few minor impacts to public
resources. Although most of the transmission main goes along highways or roadways. the
construction will inevitably damage some scattered trees and other plants along its route and
decrease the vegetation coverage in places. According to survevs, no endangered or protected
animals are found in the project area.
Within the project area. including the WTW and the transmission main, there are no old.
large, rare or precious trees growing. Oniv one large fig tree, which belongs to a protective
tree categorv. stands bv the highway about 50 m away from the proposed intake. The
construction activitv will not affect the tree.
Spoil generated by excavation of the pipeline can affect the environment during rainfall due
to soil erosion and possible subsidence impacts. In order to avoid soil erosion some measures
should be taken. including suspending construction during raining days. building trenches and
protective bunds around big stockpiling sites of earth and rocks and back-filling immediately
after construction xvhere possible.
Excavation and back-filling wvill chanee the original properties of the topsoil on farmland. and
decrease the fertilitv of soil. Once the top soil is damaged. it can take a long time to recover.
During this recovery time crop girowth and yields will be affected.
Four river crossings are required along the 66 km pipeline route. They will involve the
construction of both pipe bridges and siphons and special care will be required to restore the
w%atercourses to the natural condition after construction is completed and not dump excess
spoil in the watercourses.
Domestic Wfustewu ter
In the construction phase. about 200 workers will be working in the construction sites.
Except for some technical workers. most of them will be local residents (including farmers)
and they will have their own places to eat and sleep. Technical workers will stav at small inns
in adjacent towns or townships. so no new pollution sources will be created. All wastewater
from anv proposed dormitory accommodation must be treated in a septic tank prior to
discharge as per local regulations.

E 2.3   Potential Operational Phase Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 2.3.1 Impacts
NVoise
During operation. noise will mainly come from pumps. air blowers, motors. etc., with sound
levels aeneraily rangina from  75 - 90 dB(A).  This may have an adverse impact on the
surrounding acoustic environment if no mitigation measures are taken. In order to mitigate
the impact of noise. low-noise equipment will be specified and some noise control measures.
such as silencers. sound insulation and vibration reduction. will be taken to decrease the
sound level down to 85 dB(A).
SRIEP monitored the backlground sound level at a point located on the eastern boundarv of
the proposed WTW  near the intake station for the Changtu Works.  The monitoring was
conducted day and ni_ht. and the results used as backgyround values of ambient noise. The
monitoring results are expressed bv equivalent continuous sound levels. in the daytime 49.2
dB(A). wvhile in the night. 42.5 dB(A).
Since the proposed Works site is located in the suburb of Zigon2. Class B of the national
standard. Urban  Regional Environmental Noise Standard, GB3096-93. is applied.  This
specifies a limit of 60 dB(A) in the day and 50 dB(A) at night. All the current monitoring
values are lower than the standard values. The measured background values are also lower
than the Class A limits of 55 dB(A) for day time and 45 dB(A) for night. by 5.8 dB(A) and
2.8 dB(A) respectively. So the site currentiv has a relatively good acoustic environment.
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                               E-15                                DECEMBER 1998

Structures. which are used to house the equipment, will have sound insulating measures
incorporated in their design and they are generallv located partiallv under ground (for
example. the clean water pumping house will be embedded 3.5m). However, these measures
can only reduce noise level to some extent. Therefore other noise control measures have been
adopted in the design of the plant lavout. According to the design. the air blower house and
backwash tower are located in the east side. 13m from the WTW boundarv. The clean water
pumping house is located in the northern side. 24m from the boundary. The distance between
the two houses is estimated at 70m.
The distances between the southern boundarv or western boundary and above-mentioned two
main noise sources are over 95m. the forecast shows no violation of standard will occur. As
the standard values both for the boundarv and the external environment are the same, the
noise levels in the externai environment are not predicted to exceed the standard by inference
after putting into operation.
The noise levels for pumps in the intake station or pumps in the intermediate pumping, station
are less than 85 dB(A) at source. Walls will be built around those stations, providing sound
insulation. In addition, the intake station is bv the riverside and the intermediate pumping
station is in a woodland between hills. and no farmer households and other acoustic sensitive
points are located nearby
Odoutrs
The onlv potential odour concerns relate to breakdowns in normal operations and chlorine gas
leaks.
Sludge treatment and disposal
Both the existing Changtu WTW and the new Yuan Ba Chang WTW will be designed to
dispose the WTW sludges arising from filter backwash waters directly to the adjacent surface
waters (Xushui River). This follows existing Chinese practice for all potable WTW in the
province. In most situations, these sludges are returned to the same surface water as the
source wvater and the discharges cause little problem. The high sludge loadings of the
discharges correspond to the raw water sediment loading and the discharges are usually not
noticeable. However. in Zigong the raw water is being conveyed from the Min River and
discharged to the much smaller Xushui River. with drv season flows as small as 0.5 m'is.
The Xushui River has a total length of 118 km. and has several functional divisions. The
proposed outfall of the WTW is located over 100 m downstream of the Chongtanvan
Reservoir. The river section has been designated as Class IIl under the surface water standard
(but this may be unrealistic given the low drv-season flows).
The WTW wastewater contains mainly sand. silt and other inorganic matters. Based on the
annial monitoring data. heavy metal contents are verv low, and none exceed 0.1 mg/I except
Fe.  In addition to some residues of flocculent and disinfection agent. no other toxic
substances enter the treatment process. There is no direct harm to aquatic organisms and onlv
minor impact on the water quality near the outfall.
The source and quantitv of sedimentation sludge was predicted bv SRIEP bv analysing vearly
sediment loads at Gaovang. The quantity and frequency of backwash water. and hence, the
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                      E-16                         DECEMBER 1998

quantity of wastewater containing sedimentation sludge. is directly related to the silt content
of the raw water. Based on the experience of similar WTW along the Min River. it is
estimated that the proposed WTW will generate 6 000 m;/d of sludge wastewater during the
flood season. containing up to 94.44 t/d of sludge.
The sludge wastewater quantitv will decrease during dry and normal flow seasons. The
yeariv average concentration of sludge is 15.74 kg/m;.
Sludge wastewater will be discharged for set periods each dav. the duration of discharge
depending on the content of sludge. The impacts of sedimentation sludge on the river water
are analysed below by calculation.
High water season:
Discharge rate 157.40 t/d.
Average river flow rate 160 m-/s,
Maximum sludge content 0.95 kg!i m3.
Based on discharge time of 3 hours per day.
During high water flow season. the maximum silt content of the river water .will increase to
1.04 k /rm3, which is the sum of the background value plus the sludge content (0.09 kgIm3) of
wastewater. This represents an increase of about 9% compared to background value. Thus
the river channel is not affected.
Normal water flow season:
Discharge rate 20.80 tld.
Average river flow rate 9.9 m;/s.
Maximum sludge content 0.35 kg/m3.
Based on discharge time of 3 hours a dav.
During normal water flow season. the maximum silt content of the river water will increase to
0.54 ka/m'. which is the sum of the background value plus the sludge content (0.54 kgrmn) of
wastewater. This represents an increase of about 5.6% compared to background value. Hence
it is considered that there is no adverse impact on the river.
Low water flow season:
Discharge rate 1.90 t/d.
Average river flow rate 0.50 mr/s.
Maximum sludge content 0.02 k!i m;.
Based on discharge time of 3 hours a dav.
Durinie low water flow season. the maximum silt content of the river water will increase to
0.37 kggm'. w-hich is the sum of the background value plus the sludge content (0.35 k/rm') of
wastewater. The maximum content is oniv a little higher than that of norrnal water flowv
season. Thus it is also considered that there will be no adverse impact on the river.
Monitoring of the sludge discharges to the Xushui will be proposed in the monitoring plan for
the project.  If the EPB monitoring finds problems with the Xushui caused by these
dischar-es. the Water Company will construct sludge thickeners and sludge storage lagoons

to enable storage of the sludge during low flow periods and discharging at rates which can be
assimilated bv the Xushui background flows.
O&M Problerns
Operation and maintenance presents problems in manv Chinese public facilities due to a
varietv of budgetary. training, and equipment problems. The existing Changtu WTW  in
Zigong has been inspected by the design and EA team and found to be in relatively good
working order. In addition. this project will include a large technical assistance program to
improve the equipment and training of the Water Companv. The design will be state-of-the-
art and O&M  should not be a problem as the project is currently formulated. Detailed
monitoring is specified to verify performance objectives.
Chlorination - Saferv
The chlorination room contains facilities for liquid chlorine dosing, chlorine leakage detection
and treatment, and liquid chlorine storage. Three vacuum chlorinators (Q=10 kglh), 2 duty
and I standbv.  Chlorine gas goes through an automatic switch device and then into
chlorinators. The dosage is generally controlled to 2 mg/l. The drums are use to store I
month's supply of chlorine.
A chlorine leakage treatment facility is a safety installation that is used to control accidents
which occur in the chlorine dosing room.  It includes chlorine leakage alarm  svstem.
ventilation system and neutralization svstem. It can treat anv accident due to chlorine leakage
in time so as to protect workers on dutv and the adjacent environment from  chlorine
poisoning.
In order to prevent the occurrence of chlorine leakage. some detailed suggestions are put
forvard in the following categories (details in component appendix):
( I j   Transportation. storage and application of liquid chlorine drums
(2- )   Emergencv procedures for chlorine leakage
Domestic Wastewater
Eight, ne-w staff will be employed in the WTW during operation. The main pollutants in
domestic wastewater are BOD5. TSS and ammonia. The proposed staff dormitorv for staff
'ill be built in the municipal planned residential area: therefore. most of sewage will go into
septic tanks and then flow to the municipal sewer svstem. Domestic wastewater or sewaze
gzenerated from the WTW site proper will be treated bv septic tank with biogas generator. and
discharged after complying with the relevant standard.
After the proposed project is put into operation. 120 000 m'ld of treated water will supplv the
urban area of Zigong to meet the requirements of domestic use and industrial production.
SRIEP estimates that this will produce 77 200 m '/d of wastewater, including 46 000 m7'ld of
domestic sewaee and 31 200 mi/d of industrial effluents.
Another Phase I SUEP component project will construct wastewater collection and treatment
systems for Ziaon- to somewhat mitigate this concem.  However, the citv needs the
additional potable water supply and it will be a long time before all of wastewater from the
urban area is collected and treated in WwTWs.

E 3.1 Positive Impacts (Local, Basin)
WVtier Supply Qulitv and Availabilitv
Luzhou is an integrated industrial city with power, chemical, machinery and foodstuffs as the
main industries. The Changjiang rivers, with the tributaries of Tuojiang, Cishuihe. Yongning
rivers flow through its administration area. Many enterprises in the citv have their own water
suppiv system. which comprise about 81% of the total water supplv consumption in the citv.
The northern area of the citv has recentlv received rail services and development and water
consumption are expanding greatly in the area. Water shortage problems had alreadv existed
for many vears in several areas including Xiaosi, Anning and Gaoba. The area has been
identified for rapid industrial and municipal development under current citv planning.
Although Luzhou is located at the junction of two major rivers and the Yangtze provides
enormous freshwater resources. the treated and potable water supply systems are inadequate
for current or projected needs of the Citv. The per capita consumption in the Beijiao service
area is currently estimated at 148 I/day (although the quantity available to consumers may be
much lower), and the urban service area is expanding. This project will supply critically
needed potable water which will allow the per capita availability to rise, the service area to
expand, and the exploitation of increaseing economic development opportunities.
Sanitation and Public Health
The expanded use of raw water from the Yangtze River will allow the discontinuation of use
of the polluted Tuo River as a domestic water source in Luzhou as well as unsatisfactory and
non-compliant WTWs in the small towns being served. This eliminates polluted sources of
water supply and the attendant problems associated with treating this source water. It also
allows additional baseflow water to remain in the Tuo Rivers through Luzhou. which is
needed for the conveyance and dilution of other domestic and industrial wastewaters.
Economic Development
The suppiv of adequate municipal water is a minimum requirement to enable the city (and
surrounding towns) to grow and develop economically into the future. This facility will
service both a large development zone in the city as well as fast growina towns to the north.
E 3.2 Potential Short Term Construction Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 3.2.1 Impacts
Relocaition and Land.4cquisition
30 mu of land will be acquired and 10 farmer households (39 persons) w%ill be relocated by the
Beijiao WTW Phase 2 works. The project involves Shichangswan and Yivuan Cooperatives in
Yixin Village of Yutang Town. 30 persons in Shitangwan Cooperative will transfer their
status from  agriculture to non-agriculture.  According to the Regulation for the Land
vlanazement of Sichuan Province. Document LSFDF NO.30 (1989) and Notice on New
Compensation Standard for Land Acquisition in Document LSFD NO.64 (1989), in terms of
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                     E-21                        DECEMBER 1998

Volume 3 - Appcndix C
the arable land, the compensation to be paid will be 6 times the basic compensation. In term
of other land compensation, the compensation will be 3 times the basic compensation.
For crops and land attachments, the compensation is based on Document LSFF No.30 (1989)
and LSFD No.64 (1989) with a price inflation factor applied. For relocation compensation. 2
or 3 times the yield per mu three years aco is adopted. During the land acquisition for this
scheme. 200m of telecommunication cable will be relocated with compensation of 0.15
million yuan based on the Document LSFD No.64 (1989) and consultation with the post and
telecommunication department. It is estimated that the total compensation pavable under the
scheme is 2.23 million yuan, which includes resettlement expense of 0.43 million vuan.
Demolition/Spoils
During the project construction some spoil will be generated including soils and rocks
abandoned in the process of laying the transmission main. The majoritv of the excavated
material will be re-used as back-fill around the pipe and trench.
It is initiallv calculated that for the 35 km of transmission pipe from the Beijiao WTW to Fuji
Town. the total volume of earthwork will be 13 500 m3'. For the 3.6 km of transmission pipe
from the Beijiao WTP to the Nan Gao Development Zone. the total volume of earthwork will
be 1810 m3.
In 1996. the People's Government of Sichuan Province decided to turn Fuji Town into the
countv town of Luxian Countv. With the expansion of Fuji Town and the development of
Nan Gao Development Zone. spoil from the scheme can be transported to these locations for
use in earth works and road construction. Through proper management the impact of spoil
disposal can be eliminated. SRIEP has reviewed the local plans for spoil disposal on this
project and found them to be environmentaliv acceptable. Excess spoils will essentially be
used in roadway or other construction or disposed of to adjacent farmland subject to
a2reements sianed with local farmers.
Voise anrd Dust
Heavy load trucks for transporting pipes are mobile and intermittent sources emitting
significant noise during pipe laying, with noise levels in the range of 85-90 dB(A). The noise
impact should not be significant since thev will oniv operate in the daytime. they are less
frequent than vehicle flows on existing roadwavs. and the sites are not near urban areas. The
pipeline will be excavated using manual labour so dust and noise will be minimised.
Limitinu- construction to the davtime hours will mitigate noise problems. The pipeline will be
excavated USil1g maniual labour in manv cases so dust and noise will be minimised. During
the construction operation of construction equipment and the running of vehicles will
generate noise. The noise levels will depend on the types and numbers of machines and
vehicles. Generally their noise levels range from 80 to 90 dB(A). The construction noise will
have adverse impact on people living near the construction site or alongi the highway. In
order to meet the requirements specified bv Boundary Noise Limits for Construction Sites
(G312523-90). night-time construction activities will be prohibited. with the use of trucks
and equipment prohibited bv 23:00 hr each dav (except for road crossings which may be
allowed to minimise daytime construction impacts).
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                     E-22                          DECEMBER 1998

Volumnc 3 - Appendix E
If it is necessary to utilise groundwater pumps, they will be provided with appropriate noise
and vibration protection devices. This will be especiallv important for night-time dewatering.
Mitigation measures will be required as well as monitoring.
Management practices are recommended to minimise erosion and runoff from storage piies
and tor site clean up after construction is completed.
Dust emitted from house dismantling and building construction of the plant will have adverse
impact on the environment. In addition. activities such as pipe laying. earthwork and filling
also generate flving dust and cause air pollution. However. the impact of flying dust will be
temporarv. localised and limited to the construction period.
Beijiao WTP. distribution well. per-sedimentation tank, flocculation-sedimentation tank.
valveless filter. clean water reservoir. clean water pump house. wastewater recycling tank.
chemical and chlorine dosing room. administration building, part of dormitorv have been built
in Phase I project. In Phase 2 project, a new set of flocculation tank, pre-sedimentation tank.
sedimentation tank. valveless filter. a 2 000m- of dormitory, a workshop and a garage. etc.
will be built. Since Phase 2 involves less construction work, the project will have less impact
on the air and acoustic environment.
Transportation
To minimise disruption of agricultural land, much of the pipeline will be installed in or
adjacent to the existing road between Beijiao and Fuji. It will be necessary to permanently
widen the roadway and/or construct temporarv roads to maintain traffic flow during the
construction period. Noise concerns normally would limit construction to the daytime but
road crossings will be allowed at night to minimise traffic disruption on this highway.
Safe/v Issuzes
The pipe trenches will be excavated bv hand. except in rock. when stratum consist of sand
and gravel materials they will require wideibattered trenches in order to protect against trench
coliapse. Strict safety measures will be recommended.
Pzublic Facilities
There are minimum impacts to public facilities but there are a few minor impacts to public
resources. Although most part of the transmission main goes alona highwavs or roadways. the
construction will inevitabiv damage some scattered trees and other vegetation along its route.
Accordinu to surveys. no endangered or protected animals are found in the project area.
Spoil generated bv excavation of the pipeline can affect the environment durinm rainfall due
to soil erosion and possible subsidence impacts. In order to avoid soil erosion some measures
should be takeni. including suspending construction during raining davs. building trenches and
protective bunds around big stockpiling sites of earth and rocks and back-fillina immediatelv
after construction where possible.
Excavation and back-filling will change the original properties of the topsoil on farmiand. and
decrease the fertilitv of soil. Once the top soil is damaged, it can take a long time to recover.
During this recoverv time crop growth and yields will be affected.

Domestic WVastewvater
The impact on surface waters associated with the project is mainiv from domestic wastewater.
oenerated by workers or staff on the construction sites, and construction wastewater, from
equipment  washing,  concrete  curing. and  leakage  testing.   The  quantitv  of domestic
wvastewater is related to the numbers of construction staff, which depends on the degree of
mechanisation and construction programme. The main pollutants in domestic wastewater are
BOD5. TSS and ammonia. As most of the construction workers are local residents. the
additional water impact is minor.

E 3.3   Potential Operational Phase Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 3-3.1 Impacts
Noise
Durine operation. noise will mainly come from pumps. air blowers, motors. etc.. their sound
levels g,eneraIlv  range from  75  -  90  dB(A). It could  impact the sounding  acoustic
environment if no mitigation measure is taken. In order to mitigate the impact of noise on
surrounding area. low-noise equipment will be selected  in design. some noise controi
measures. such as deafening. sound insulation and vibration reduction. will be taken to
decrease the sound level to 85 dB(A).
For the Beijiao WTW. phase 2. noise levels at the WTW boundarv can meet the Class C limit
of GB 12348-90. Boundarv Noise Standard for Industrial Enterprises. except at the southern
boundarv where the noise level will be a little higher than the standard value. Noise levels
about lOm as av fromfn the WTW  boundarv of the WTW  are 12.9 - 44dB(A). There are no
sensitive receptors around the WTW. Almost no noise impact occurs 20 meters awav from
the boundarv and the external noise outside of the boundary is considered to basically meet
the Class C of GB3096-93. Urban Regional Environmental Standard.
.4quatzic Fish and Vegetation
The existing intake pump station will also be used for Beijiao WTW. phase 2. The intake
inlet is deep under the water surface and no aquatic plants are growing around the pump
station. The raw water abstraction will have no impact on the surrounding aquatic plants.
Since the intake inlet is deep under the water surface, around the inlet light is poor and there
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                            E-25                              DECENIBER 1998

are few algae. Raw water abstraction will have no obvious impact on species diversitv and
mass of algae.
The Yangtze River Basin is a major production area for freshwater fish in China. Every year
the quantity of fish caught in the river accounts for two thirds of the catch for the wvhole
COunty. Chinese sturgeon are river-sea migratoryv fish. Another protected species in the
Yangtze is the giant salamander. However. here are no existing sturgeon or giant salamander
habitats in the Yangtze at Luzhou. In view of the available high flows this project will have
no impact on the fisheries of the Yangtze.
Sludcige treatment aind disposal
In the WTW. silt and other inorganic matters will be settled out through pre-sedimentation.
sedimentation. clarification. and filtration. resulting sedimentation sludge. The main content
of the wastewater is silt and inorganic suspended matters. and the concentrations varv with
the turbiditv of raw water which is higher during the high flow during the wet season. Both
Beijiao and Daxikou WTWs draw water from the Yangtze River. The combined dailv water
capacitv for the twvo WTWs is 100 000 m3ld. The annual average silt content is 0.71 kg/m3.
the annual sludge content of wastewater from the WTW will be 26 000t.
Silt and sand are the main content of the sludge generated from treatment process in the
WTW. According to investigations. most WTWs in China flush sedimentation sludges back
into the rivers from which the raw water was abstracted. This project will do the same.
Sludge will drain directlv via a channel to a discharge point on the Yangtze 120 m
downstream of the intake.
Since the Yangtze has a high flow rate. it can reach 2 050 m3/s even in the low water season.
sludge generated from  the project will not cause anv obstruction of the river course.
However. localised TSS concentration may be increased. Based on the calculation, the silt
content of the Yangtze River will increase bv onlv 0.0009 kg/m  after the sludge-containing
wastewater is discharged to the river. Adding its background value. the accumulated silt
content will be 0.0721 kg/m'. being lower than the maximum silt content of the river in low
water season. It is concluded that the discharge of WTW  sludge to the Yanytze will cause
negligible water quality impacts to the river.
O&M Problems
Operation and maintenance presents problems in manv Chinese public facilities due to a
varietv of budgetarv. training. and equipment problems. The existing Beijiao WTW in
LuzIIou has been inspected by the desisn and EA team and found to be in relativelv !zood
workimg order. This is v erified by the wvater quality records of the treated x%ater.
In addition. this project will include a large technical assistance program to improve the
equipment and training of the Water Companv. O&M should not be a problem as the project
is currently formulated. Detailed monitoring is specified to verify performance objectives.

month's supply of chlorine.
A chlorine leakage treatment facility is a safety installation that is used to control accidents
whiich occur in the chlorine dosing room.  It includes chlorine leakaue alarm  svstem.
ventilation svstem and neutralization svstem. It can treat anv accident due to chlorine leakage
in time so as to protect workers on dutv and the adjacent environment from chlorine
poisoning.
In order to prevent the occurrence of chlorine leakage, some detailed suggestions are put
forward in the following categories (details in component appendix):
(1)     Transportation, storage and application of liquid chlorine drums
(2)     Emergency procedures for chlorine leakage
Domestic Wastewvater
Eighty three new staff will be employed in the Beijiao and Daxikou WTW when thev are put
into operation. If the wastewater discharge per person is 0.2 m3/d. this will result in 16.6 m7'd
of on-site domestic wastewater. The main pollutants in domestic wastewater are TSS. BOD5
and ammonia. Domestic wastewater generated from the WTWs will be treated by septic tanks
with biogas generators, such that the discharges comply with the relevant standard.
The design capacity of phase I of the Beijiao WTW is 50 000 m;. But the practical capacity
is only 40 000 m;/d. The proposed project will increase capacity by an additional 60 000
m'/d.
Fuji Town has an existing small WTW with a capacitv of 10 000 m3/d using raw water from
the Laixi River. This river originates in Gaoping Township of Dazu Countv. flows into
Luxian Countv through Rongxian Town and finally flows into the Tuo River at Hushi Town.
The average flow of the river is 47.43 m3/s. Fuji also discharges wastewater to the Laixi
River. After the completion of this project. Fuji Town will take raw water from the Yangtze
River. The wastewater discharge to the Laixi River will increase by '2 000 m3/d based on the
30 000 m' supplied to Fuji Town. If no sewage treatment system is provided. the current
daily 4.4 t/d of BOD and 6.6 t,d of COD will increase. assuming a wastewater loading of
BOD of 200 me/l and COD of 300 mg/l in the sewage.
Concentrations of BOD and COD in Laixi River alreadv exceed the standards. mainlv
because domestic wastewater from Fuji Town is discharged without treatment. The pollutant
dischargyes from the project will oniv make a small contribution to the deterioration of water
qualitv in the Laixi River. However. to further reduce pollutant concentrations in the river in
order to complv with the Class III of the Environmental Qualitv Standard for Surface Water
(GB3838-88). the local govemment should encourage septic tank usage to treat domestic
sewagze in the towns. In addition. industries should set up wastewater treatment facilities to
complv with discharge standards. Luzhou CC has inspected the sewerage and drainage
svstems in the town and verified that they are adequate to convev the additional wastewater to
the surface streams and not cause localised health problems.

The Nan Gao Development Zone belongs to the Central District of Luzhou City and only 3
km  away from  the citv centre. The proposed project will supply 30 000 m3 of drinking water
to the zone per dav. thus the wastewater discharge quantity of Luzhou Citv will increase.
Thie estimated 24 000 m3/d of wastewater discharoed will increase the current pollutant load
from around 4.8 t/d of BOD and 7.2 t/d of COD. Since the Yangtze has a large water flow
and high dilution abilitv, the increased wastewater will have a si2nificant water quality
impact. As noted previously, the collection and treatment of wastewater in Luzhou did not
receive a high  funding  prioritv for Phase I of the SUEP  due to the minimal water qualitv
improvement that such a scheme would foster.  It will be important for all Sichuan cities to
build wastewater collection and treatment schemes in the future as funding allows.

Volume 3- Appendix E
E 4    Luzhou Daxikou WTW
E 4.1 Positive Impacts (Local, Basin)
WVater Supplv Quaulitv und A vailabilitv
Luzhou is an integrated industrial city with power. chemical. machinerv and foodstuffs as the
main industries. The Changjianc rivers. with the tributaries of Tuojiang, Cishuille. Yongning
rivers flow through its administration area. Many enterprises in the city have their own water
supplv systems. which cater for about 81% of the total water suppiv in the cit,v.
Although Luzhou is located at the junction of several major rivers and the Yangtze provides
enormous freshwater resources, the treated and potable water suppiv svstems are inadequate
for current or projected needs of the Citv. The per capita consumption in the Daxikou service
area is currently estimated at I00 l/dav (although the quantity available to consumers from the
water company is much lower), and the urban service area is expanding. This project will
suppiv criticaliv needed potable water which will allow the per capita availability to rise, the
service area to expand, and the exploitation of economic development opportunities.
Sanitation and Putblic Health
The expanded use of raw water from the Yangtze will allow use of the Guanshan WTW,
which currently violates national standards for potable water qualitv, to be discontinued. This
facilitv is inadequate in both quantitv and qualitv of water produced for this area, especiallv in
view of the proposed urban expansion.
Economic Development
The supply of adequate municipal water is a minimum requirement to enable the city to grow
and develop economicallv in the future.
E 4.2  Potential Short Term Construction Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 4.2.1 Impacts
Relocation and Lcand Acquisition
Phase I project of the proposed Daxikou WTW is located in Baiti Village in Naxi District. 41
mu of land will be required. I I households with 43 people will eb relocated and 29 persons
will be provided with jobs and their status transferred from agriculture to non-agriculture.
Accordingy to the relevant regulations. the compensation pavable for land acquisition is 2.8
million vuan. resettlement expense is 1.3 million yuan. giving a total of 4.1 million vuan.
Expenises for land acquisition and compensation are included in the project cost estimate.
Deliolitionl/Spoils
During the project construction some spoil will be generated including soils and rocks
abandoned in the process of lavins the transmission main. The majority of the excavated
material will be re-used as back-fill around the pipe and trench.
For the 2 km of the transmission pipe from the Daxikou WTW to the regulation tank at
Guanshan WTW. the total volume of earthworks is I 57 1m;3.
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                     E-3O                          DECEMBER 1998



SCICIUAN URBAN ENVIRONNIENT PROJECT                       ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Voiume 3 - Appendix E
Pipeline construction will be divided into several sections and constructed simultaneously.
Spoil generated by the excavation should be stockpiled within, the i to 10 m wide wvorking
area alone the trench. It is estimated that the total surplus spoil volume due to construction of
Beijiao and Daxikou WTWs is 16 800 mi.
From the construction of Daxikou WTW, it is estimated that the total spoil volume from the
construction of sedimentation tanks and clear water reservoirs is about 25 000 m;. It is
proposed to dispose of this spoil to developments in Fuji Town and the Nan Gao
Development Zone along with spoil from the Beijiao WTW scheme.
SRIEP has reviewed the local plans for spoil disposal on this project and found them to be
environmentally acceptable. Excess spoils will essentially be used in roadway or other
construction or disposed of to adjacent farmland subject to agreements signed with local
farmers.
ANoise and Dzust
Heavv load trucks for transporting pipes are mobile and intermittent sources emitting
significant noise during pipe laying, with noise levels in the range of 85-90 dB(A). The noise
impact should not be significant since thev will only operate in the daytime. they are less
frequent than vehicle flows on existing roadwavs. and the sites are not near urban areas. The
pipeline will be excavated using manual labour so dust and noise will be minimised.
Limitine construction to the daytime hours will mitigate noise problems. The pipeline will be
excavated usine manual labour in many cases so dust and noise will be minimised. During
the construction operation of construction equipment and the running of vehicles will
generate noise. The noise levels will depend on the types and numbers of machines and
vehicles. Generally their noise levels range from 80 to 90 dB(A). The construction noise will
have adverse impact on people livins near the construction site or along the highway. In
order to meet the requirements specified by Boundary Noise Limits for Construction Sites
(GB12523-90), night-time construction activities will be prohibited, with the use of trucks
and equipment prohibited bv 23:00 hr each dav (except for road crossings which may be
allowed to minimise daytime construction impacts).
If it is necessarv to utilise groundwater pumps. they will be provided with appropriate noise
and vibration protection devices. This will be especially important for night-time dewatering.
Miitigation measures will be required as well as monitoring.
Manae ement practices are recommended to minimise erosion and runoff from storage piles
and For site clean up after construction is completed.
Dust emitted from hLouse dismantling and building construction of the plant will have adverse
impact on the environment. In addition. activities such as pipe laving, earthwork and filling
also generate tlying dust and cause air pollution. However. the impact of flying dust will be
temporary. localised and limited to the construction period.
Transportmtion
To minimise relocations and destruction of agricultural land. much of the pipeline will be
installed in or adjacent to the existing road between the intake and Daxikou WTW and from
41367.EA.APPENI)IXE                    E-31                          DECEMBER 1998

Volume 3 - Appendix E
the WTW  to Naxi/Anfu.  It will be necessary to widen the roadway and/or construct
temporary roads to maintain traffic flow during the construction period. Noise concerns
normally would limit construction to the daytime but road crossings will be allowed at night
to minimise traffic disruption on this highway.
Safety Issues
The pipe trenches will be excavated by hand, except in rock, when stratum consist of sand
and gravel materials thev will require wide/battered trenches in order to protect against trench
collapse. Strict safety measures will be recommended.
Ptublic Facilities
There are minimum impacts to public facilities but there are a few minor impacts to public
resources. Although most part of the transmission main goes along highways or roadways. the
construction will inevitably damage some scattered trees and other vegetation along its route.
According to survevs, no endangered or protected animals are found in the project area.
Spoil generated bv excavation of the pipeline can affect the environment during rainfall due
to soil erosion and possible subsidence impacts. In order to avoid soil erosion some measures
should be taken. including suspending construction during raining days. building trenches and
protective bunds around big stockpiling sites of earth and rocks and back-filling immediatelv
after construction where possible.
Excavation and back-filling will change the original properties of the topsoil on farmland. and
decrease the fertilitv of soil. Once the top soil is damaged. it can take a long time to recover.
Durin2 this recoverv time crop growth and yields will be affected.
The treated water transmission main will be laid along the Longna Highwav. which is
currentlv under construction and no relocation is involved.
Dotmestic Wastewvater
The impact on surface waters associated with the project is mainlv from domestic wastewater.
generated by workers or staff on the construction sites. and construction wastewater, from
equipment washing. concrete curing, and leakage testing.  The quantitv of domestic
wastewater is related to the numbers of construction staff. which depends on the degree of
mechanisation and construction programme. The main pollutants in domestic wastewater are
BOD5. TSS and ammonia. As most of the construction workers are local residents. the
additional water impact is minor.

E 4.3 Potential Operational Phase Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 4.3.1 Impacts
Noise
During operation, noise will mainiy come from pumps, air blowers. motors. etc.. with sound
levels generallv ranging from  75   90 dB(A). This could have an impact the sounding
acoustic environment if no mitigation measures are taken. In order to mitigate the impact of
noise on surrounding area. low-noise equipment will be specified and some noise control
measures., sound insulation and vibration reduction, will decrease the sound pressure level to
85 dB(A).
Noise levels at the Daxikou WTW boundarv will meet the required standard and be lower
than the background value (54.8 dB(A)) except at the northern boundary where noise
emissions will a little higher than the night time standard. Noise levels at lOm awav from the
boundarv of Daxikou WTW will be a little higher than the standard value but there are no
sensitive receptors around the station. There will be almost no noise impact at 20 meters
awa,v from the boundarv. The noise emissions levels outside of the boundaryv basicaliv meet
Class C limits in GB3096-93. Urban Regional Environmental Standard. Daxikou WTW is
surrounded mainiv bv farmland with no housing, therefore the noise produced by the WTW
wvill not have negative impact on the external environment.
.4quatic Fish and Vegetation
The intake pump station of the proposed Daxikou WTW will be located 475m downstream of
the Yangtze Bridge No.' and near the existing highwavs. The main current of the river is
close to the bank with a water depth of about 10 meters. the minimum water depth in low
xwater season >8 m. and no aquatic plants are located there. Therefore. ravw w%ater abstraction
'ill have no impact on the surrounding aquatic plants. Since the intake inlet is deep under the
water surface. around the inlet light is poor and there are few algae. Rawv Nvater abstraction
will have no obvious impacts on species diversitv and biomass of the algae.
The Yangtze River Basin is a major production area for freshwater fish in China. Everv vear
the quantitv of fish caught in the river accounts for two thirds of the catch for the whole
countv. Chinese sturgeon are river-sea migratory fish. Another protected species in the
Yangtze is the giant salamander. However. here are no existing sturgeon or giant salamander
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                         E-34                            DECEMBER 1998

Volume S - Appendix E
habitats in the Yangtze at Luzhou. In view of the available high flows this project will have
no impact on the fisheries of the Yangtze.
Sludige treatment and disposal
In the WTW. silt and other inorganic matters will be settled out through pre-sedimentation.
sedimentation, clarification. and filtration. resulting sedimentation sludge. The main content
of the wastewater is silt and inorganic suspended matters. and the concentrations vary with
the turbidity of raw water which is higher during the high flow during the wet season. Both
Beijiao and Daxikou WTWs draw water from the Yangtze River. The combined daily water
capacitv for the two WTWs is 100 000 m3/d. The annual average silt content is 0.71 kg/m
the annual sludge content of wvastewater from the WTW will be 26 000t.
Silt and sand are the main content of the sludge generated from treatment process in the
WTW. According to investigations. most WTWs in China flush sedimentation sludges back
into the rivers from which the raw water was abstracted. This project will do the same.
Sludge will be discharged directlv to the Yangtze downstream of the WTW and intake.
Since the Yangtze has a high flow rate. it can reach 2 050 m3/s even in the low water season.
sludge generated from the project will not cause any obstruction of the river course.
However, localised TSS concentration may be increased. Based on the calculation. the silt
content of the Yangtze River will increase by only 0.0009 kg/rM3 after the sludge-containing
wastewvater is discharged to the river. Adding its background value, the accumulated silt
content will be 0.0721 kginr. being lower than the maximum silt content of the river in low
water season. It is concluded that the discharge of WTW sludge to the Yangtze will cause
negligibie water quality impacts to the river.
O&M Problems
Operation and maintenance presents problems in many Chinese public facilities due to a
varietv of budgetary, training, and equipment problems. The existing Beijiao WTW  in
Luzhou has been inspected bv the design and EA team and found to be in relatively good
working order. This is verified by the water quality records of the treated water.
In addition. this project will include a large technical assistance program to improve the
equipment and training of the Water Companv. O&M should not be a problem as the project
is currently formulated. Detailed monitoring is specified to verify performance objectives.
Chlorinaution - Sufety
The chlorination room consists of liquid chlorine dosing. chlorine leakage detection and
treatment. and liquid chlorine storage. Three vacuum chlorinators (Q=10 k&h). 2 duty and I
standbv. Chlorine gas goes through an automatic switch device and then into chlorinators.
The dosage is 2 mg/L generaliv. which is controlled bv complex ring controller. The storage
by drums can supply chlorine for one month.
Chlorine leakage treatment facilitv is a safety installation that is used to control accidents
occur in the chlorine dosing room. It includes chlorine leakage alarm system. ventilation
svstem and neutralization system. It can treat any accident due to chlorine leakage in time so
as to protect workers on duty and the adjacent environment from chlorine poisoning. Among
the subsvstems. chlorine dosing subsystem is easily out of the control. In particular, the

SICIIUAN UR13AN ENVIRONMIENT PROJECT                       ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
Volumt 3, - Appendix E
E: 5   Chengdu Nr 2 WwTW
E 5.1 Positive Impacts (Local, Basin)
Water Oualitv Improvements
The collection and treatment of 300 000 m-'ld of domestic and industrial wastewater wvithin
Chengdu w'ill have major water quality improvement benefits to the Shahe and Fuhe rivers
within Chengdu and smaller benefits for the downstream Min River. The proposed project
will be a siginificant step towards the recovery of these surface waters but will not be
sufficient to enable them meet the targeted Class 3 surface water standards without other
major interventions. The current polluted conditions result from a combination of factors
including rural loads (natural and agricultural sources). urban loads (domestic, industrial and
non-point sources) and insufficient base flows at certain times of the year.
The urban pollution impacts assessment assessed the potential water quality impacts of
proposed SUEP projects through the use of a water quality index. The greatest benefit from
the proposed Chengdu No. 2 scheme will be along the Sha He through the city of Chengdu
where there could be as much as a 50% improvement in the water quality reach index. In the
Fu He downstream of the citv of Chengdu. there would be a 20% improvement in the reach
index. According to the modelling results. the Min would also be improved by about 10% as
far downstream as Leshan.
The first phase SUEP projects, including the Chengdu Nr 2 WwTW. are designed to start the
process of surface water improvement (as well as the adjacent aroundwater system). Future
phases of the SUEP will address control of the other rural and urban pollution sources. as well
as potential river-flow and stream channel enhancements.
Sanitation and Public Health
One of the most tangible and direct benefits of this wastewater collection and treatment
scheme will be the removal of raw domestic and industrial overflows to the local drainage and
surface water svstems in the citv (except for emergency bypass conditions). The pollutants in
municipal wastewater are suspended and dissolved solids consisting of inorganic and organic
matter, nutrienits. oil and grease. toxic substances. and pathogenic micro-organisms. Urban
stormwater can contain the same pollutants. occasionallv in surprisingly high concentrations.
Human wastes that are not properly treated and are disposed of at the point of origin or
collected and carried awvav (nightsoil), pose risks of parasitic infections (through direct
contact with faecal material) and hepatitis and various gastrointestinal diseases including
cholera and typhoid (through contamination of water supplies and food).
When wastewater is collected but not treated properly before disposal or reuse. the same
public health hazards exist at the point of discharge. For the receivina waters, additional
harmful effects will occur such as: habitats for aquatic life are impaired bv accumulated
solids: oxy Len is depleted by decomposition of organic material: and aquatic organisms may
be further harmed bv toxic substances. which mav spread to higher organisms through
bioaccumulation.

41367.EA.APPENDIXE                      E-38                           DECEMvBER 1998



SICI JIAN URLIAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT                       ENVIR0oNMEII:NTAL ASSESSMENT
Volumnc 3 - Appendix E
Water is used intensively in the Sichuan Province and the discharge of wastewater in one
location quicklv becomes the raw water suppiv source for a downstream irrigation. domestic
or industrial user. The improvement of the quality of this suppiv will have obvious positive
effects on the productivity of agricultural land and reduction of treatment svstem costs for
domestic and industrial users. These benefits accrue to entities that are not directlv paying for
the improvements. emphasising the need for a comprehensive SUEP viewpoint relative to
costs and benefits of improvement schemes.
.4esthetics and Wfaciter Amenity
The surface waters in Chengdu form a major backdrop and focus in the citv and the
improvement of water quality and sanitarv conditions along these drainage wavs will greatly
improve the city aesthetics. Urban renewal efforts are already underway in the city to replace
dilapidated buildines with river side parks and water amenities. In Mav 1998. dragon boat
races were held on the renewed Nan River for the first time in 37 vears. Watervavs
historically form focal points for economic and tourist activities and the citv should reap these
benefits with the implementation of this scheme.
Power Produiction Potential
There is a potential to install gas engines and produce electricitv from gyas produced by the
anaerobic di2estion facilities. The proper operation of the digestion facilities will have to be
confirmed before this potential can be realised. However, the environmental benefits of a
water pollution control facility will be enhanced if it also produces energy.
E 5.2  Potential Short Term Construction Impacts, Mitigation and iMonitoring
E 5.2.1 Impacts
Relocation and Compensation
The compensation for the opened highway. road and farmland will be in accordance with the
Reguliation for the Land Management of Sichuan  Province and MWeasures fbr the
Comnpensation of the Land Acquisition for Public Facilities Construction and the Relocattion
of the Resicdents of Chengdzu. Resettlement and compensation costs are estimated at 13 1
million Yuan and include 478 mu of land and the resettlement of 340 households (see RAP
for fiurther details).
Demolition
There is minimum demolition required for this project component and the issue has been
covered in the RAP for the project.
.Voise an7d DustI
The interceptor sewer wvill be excavated using manual labour so dust and noise will be
minimised. If it is necessarv to utilise groundwater pumps. thev will be provided with
appropriate noise and vibration protection devices. This will be especially important for
night-time dewatering.  The existing agricultural area should not be a problem  for
construction of the WN TW. There were no sensitive areas noted and it was recommended to
prohibit the use of trucks and heavy equipment at least b,v 23:00 hr.

Volume r - Appendix E
Management practices are recommended to minimise erosion and runoff from storage piles
and for site clean up after construction is completed.
Transportation
There are minimal road crossings required and operational and scheduling plans have been
developed  to minimise traffic  impacts.  There  is a railway  crossing  which  will require
tunnelling as per standard practice for such crossings. so there will be no disruption.
Safriv Issues
The pipe trenches will be excavated bv hand up to iO m  deep in sand and gravel strata. Steel
trench suipports xvill be used in order to protect against trench collapse. Strict safety measures
will be recommended.
Ptublic Facilities
There are no identified major impacts to public facilities. The stream crossings can easilv be
accomplished with minimal impact or flow disruption. The railway will be tunnelled so there
will be no impacts. The crossing of Cheng Ren road should be accomplished at night. if
possible. to minimise traffic disruption.

Volumc 3 - Appendix E
E 5.3 Potential Operational Phase Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 5-3.1 Impacts
Sew aege Overflows (collection, pump stations. plant.)
Raw sewage will be allowed to bypass the WwTW  during electrical outages or plant
operational problems. The WwvTW wet well at the inlet to the plant will provide only a short-
term  buffer for such situations and raw  sewage will be soon bvpassed under these
circumstances. However. it is not considered cost-effective to provide either larger storage
for these situations or alternative power supplies. Raw sewage currentlv discharges to surface
waters untreated. It is noted that the Fu River will not meet the recommended Class III for
surface water standards whether the treatment plant operates or not. As such, the large cost to
mitigate this situation is not deemed appropriate during Phase I of SUEP.
Inidustrial WYaste Upsets
There is a large industrial contribution to the Chengdu Nr 2 WwTW (over 50%) and there is
an unknown level of pre-treatment in this area. There is a possibilitv of industrial waste
upsets to the plant but rigorous influent monitoring will be specified as well as operational
plans to mitigate such problems. The limited sampling conducted by the SRIEP indicates that
industrial upsets will not be a problem.
ioise
The acoustic environment in the plant site is relatively good as it is set in farmland and no
industrv is located nearbv.  For monitoring background sound levels. four points were
selected bv SRIEP at residential sites south. north. west and east of the WTW respectivelv.
The measured background values of the proposed site are 10 - I I dB(A) and 3 - 10 dB(A)
lower than the specified limits for Class A. which are 55dB(A) in the daytime and 45 dB(A)
at night-time respectivelv (Urban Regional Environmental Noise Standard. GB3096-93). The
existing situation of background noise in the plant site is relafively good. Class A of
GB3096-93 is suitable mainly for residential quarters and cultural and educational areas. It is
also suitable for residential areas in the countrvside.
There are three proposed retLrn-sludge pump houses at about 170 m away from one to
another. Since most of the facilities of the proposed plant are similar to those of Sanwavao.
SRIEP used the Sanwvavao sound level for the return-sludge pump houses. i.e. 78 dB(A). The
combined sound level from 3 return-sludge pump houses is predicted to be 85.8 dB(A) bv
calculation. Attenuation of sound is affected bv a number of factors. such as buildings.
vegtetation cover. meteorological conditions. and so on. Because the engineering siructures of
the plant are low in height and spaced out from each other and the investigation range is long,
a semi-free attenuation model of noise source was used to estimate the sound level.
The shortest distance from one of the return-sludge pump houses to the plant boundarv is 80
m (to the southern boundary). In order to guarantee the degree of confidence in the noise
level forecasted. SRIEP assumed a combined source was located there. The sound level at the
southern boundarv is 47.8dB(A). Based on the ambient background noise monitoring results.
the maximum value 45dB(A) is selected as the background value of noise. The sound level at
the northern boundarv is 49.6dB(A) bv calculation. As class B of GB12348-90 is used to
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                      E-42                           DECEM1BER 1998



SIC-IUAN URBAN ENVIRONMENT IROJECT                         ENVIRONNIENTAL ASSESSNIENT
Volume 3 - Appendix F
evaluate the noise level at the northern boundary, 6OdB(A) for daytime and 5OdB(A) for
night-time. the proposed project can meet the standard.
After the completion of the project, Class B of GB3096-93 will be used for the outer area of
the plant. that is 6OdB(A) for daytime and 5OdB(A) for night-time. The same standards are
used for the area at the boundarv and outside of the boundary. Therefore noise in the outer
area of the plant will also meet the standard. The project will not affect the external
environment in term of noise disturbance. However, the project includes normal noise control
measures such as noise barrier rooms, and the provision of a greenbelt area surrounding the
facility.
Odours
Offensive odours generated in the operational phase of the plant emit in the form of plane
source. According to the data acquired from an investigation of the Sanwavao WwTW
(considered a worst-case scenario due to the varietv of operational problems evident at this
WwTW), SRIEP modelled potential odours at the proposed WwTW.
Since offensive odours are emitted from ground sources. an inversion layer close to the
ground can affect diffusion in the air. According to the statistical data available. inversion
layers close to the ground occur all the year round. Their frequency of occurrence is 5% in
the morning, or 22% in the evening. The annual mean thickness is 278.1 m at 7:00 am. or
153.5 m at 7:00 pm, so it is thicker in the morning than in the evening.
Under worst case scenarios using data from the problematic Sanwavao WwTW, the following
predicted odours were obtained:
(I)    Concentrations of ammonia. trimethylamine and hydrogen sulphide are lower
than their standard values at the plant boundarv, only the concentrations of
methvl mercaptan and methyl sulphide exceed the standard values at 300
meters and 300 meters away from the plant boundarv, respectively.
(2)    Concentrations of offensive chemicals decrease quickly as the distance
increases. especially within 300 meters from their sources.
Much of the concern over the potential for local odour problems is based on investigations of
the Sanwayao WwTW. This facility has historicaliv had problems operating the sludge
dizestion facilities and this mav cause a large source of the odour problems there. In addition.
this facilitv bvpasses significant raw untreated sewage everv dav that is also a source of
odours.  Finaliv. the operation and maintenance of the facilitv has had problems and
periodically. insufficient aeration seems to occur. All of these problems would indicate that
the problems should not be as severe at the Chengdu Nr 2 WwTW. The site is in an
a_ricultural area and the use of a ureenbelt and tree plantings should also mitigate anv
potential problems to a significant degree.
Effluent wvater qualitv impact
Treated effluent will constitute a pollution source and impact on the Fu locally and for several
km  downstream.  This condition is also aggravated bv the fact that raw and treated
wastewater from Sanwavao also enters this reach of the Fu river. The treated effluent from
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                      E-43                           DECEMBER 1998



SICHIUAN URBAN ENVIRONNIENT I'ROJECT                      ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESsMENrr
Volulic S - Appcndix E
Chengdu Nr 2 WwTW will cause an impact but overall the river condition will improve due
to overall organic loading reduction.
Sludge treatment and disposal
Sludge at the Chengdu Nr 2 WwTW will be anaerobicallv digested and dewatered. As
mentioned. all digested and dewatered sludge will be hauled to the existing Chengdu landfill
for final disposal. The use of this sludge for agricultural fertiliser has not been approved bv
the Provincial EPB. The onliv operational concerns over the sludge management svstem is
that sludge storage facilities should be covered (main concern is the wet season rains) and a
truck depot should be constructed for loading sludge for transport to the landfill. At design
conditions. the Chengdu Nr 2 WwTW is predicted to produce 230 t/day of sludge. requiring
39 truck loads per day hauling to the Chengdu landfill. The landfill is 35 km from the city
hauling will be a significant impact.
SRIEP have evaluated the proposed sludge hauling route. It includes Cheng Ren Road. the
Second Ring Road to Qu Luo Dai Countv in Chengdu Nr 2 Yi. No particular problems were
noted with this hauling plan. At the landfill, a special discharge point will be built to allow
for sanitarv dumping of the sludge to the landfill. SRIEP also notes that the landfill is
equipped with a leachate treatment station. in case the sludge dumping increases leachate
production. This sludge production amounts to about 10% of the current MSW loading to the
landfill and will not affect the short-term life of the landfill. Plans for further expansion of
this landfill are alreadv underway.
Anaerobic sludge digestion facilities will be constructed at the Chengdu Nr 2 WwTW.
Problems have been experienced at Sanwavao WwTW sludge digestion facilities due to
inadequate mixing. Chengdu wish to continue with anaerobic digestion and, with the
opportunity to purchase well proven equipment from the western counties. they are confident
that the benefits of the process will be realised.
Following a period of operation. when the gas production rates are confirmed and the calorific
vaiue of the gas is established. the Chengdu WW Co. may plan to install gas en-Ines coupled
to power generation plant. This approach has been evaluated and presented in the Chengdu
feasibilitv report. It is shown that the power that can be generated will be about 2 200 kw.
This would be an additional positive benefit to the WwTW if realised.
O&M Problems
Sanwavao W% TW problems indicate that O&M could be a problem. The design of the
Chend.du Nr 2 WwTW has mitigated the design features but mitigationi monitoring 'will need
to insure that the . astewater company does not trv to cut back on poxver consumption for
aeration. sludge digestion. etc.
Orgamnic Loadkig andStandards
The first concern related to the potential for the WwTW influent concentrations of organic
pollutants to either be much greater than or much less than the desigyn parameters for the
WwTW. This concern is coupled with the concern over the fact that the Sanwavao WwTW
does not meet national discharge standards. either for concentration or the percent removal of
organic pollutants. The influent domestic sewage at the Sanwavao WwTW is still combined
with stormwater that causes lower concentrations of organic pollutants. The widespread use

of septic tanks upstream of sewers also contributes to these low loadings. The design values
used for Chenedu Nr 2 appear reasonable when compared to the limited sewer sampling
results, takin_ into account that the sewers have been separated. and septic tanks will
eventually be eliminated.
The concern over the potential for organic loading to be too high relative to design standards
is coupled with the second concern over the lack of COD  design standards and the fact that
the Sanwayao WwTW does not meet the discharge standards for COD. The Chengdu Nr 2
WwTW is a secondarv biological wastewater treatment works that can easilv handle normal
loadings of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater that has been adequately pre-treated at
the industries. Organic loadings that are higher than the design standards, including high
COD loads. are indicative of problems with pre-treatment of industrial wastewater in the
sewerage catchment. The reported COD loadings in the Chengdu Nr 2 WwTW sewerage
catchment mav indicate such problems. If such a problem occurs. the solution is for the EPB
and the Wastewvater Company to apply and enforce adequate industrial pre-treatment
standards, not to apply unreaiistic design standards on the Chengdu Nr ' WwTW.
The third potential concern related to the ability of the WwTW to adequateiy remove
ammonia. and meet the discharge standards. The WwTW  has been designed and sized for
full ammonia removai. If the facility is operated as proposed. including maintaining adequate
dissolved oxvgen in the aeration basin. full ammonia removal should be achieved. The
effluent ammonia concentrations should easily meet relevant discharge standards.

E 6    Leshan Wastewater Collection and Preliminary Treatment Svstem
E 6.1 Positive Impacts (Local, Basin)
Wcter Qualitv Improvements
The serious water quality problems experienced in the reaches of the Min River through
Leshan have been outlined. The seriousness of this problem is highliQhted bv the decision of
Leshan to abandon extraction of raw water from the Min except for emergencies. Although
the Min water quality improves dramatically downstream of Leshan due to inflow from the
Dadu, the reaches within the city remain highly polluted in the dry-season. The Chengdu
WwTW. proposed in SUEP Phase I will only improve the water quality within Leshan to a
minimal degree.
The proposed wastewater collection and preliminary treatment project for Leshan will have
the capacity to remove over 250 000 m3/d of raw sewage which would otherwise be
discharged to surface waters within Leshan. either directly to the Min or indirectly through
the Zhugong Xi stream. Hence. localised water quality within the Zhugong Xi and the Min
will improve dramaticaliv through implementation of the project. There is insufficient water
quality monitoring data in these reaches to provide quantitative estimates of the degree of
water qualitv improvement that can be expected but the results should be significant.
Sanitation and Public Health
One of the most tangible and direct benefits of this wastewater collection and treatment
scheme will be the removal of the continuous raw domestic and industrial overflows to the
local drainage and surface water systems in the citv (except for emergency bvpass
conditions). The pollutants in municipal wastewater are suspended and dissolved solids
consisting of inorganic and organic matter, nutrients, oil and grease. toxic substances. and
pathogenic micro-organisms. Urban stormwater can contain the same pollutants. occasionallv
in surprisingiv high concentrations. Human wastes that are not properly treated and are
disposed of at the point of origin or are collected and carried away pose risks of parasitic
infections (through direct contact with faecal material) and hepatitis and various
gastrointestinal diseases including cholera and tvphoid (through contamination of water
supplies and food).
When wastewater is collected but not treated properlv before disposal or reuse, the same
public health hazards exist at the point of discharge. For the receiving waters. additional
harmful effects wvill occur such as: habitats for aquatic life are impaired bv accumulated
solids: oxygen is depleted bv decomposition of organic material: and aquatic organisms mav
be further harmed by toxic substances. which may spread to higher organisms through
bioaccumulation.
Dowi'nstream P'Viter Use
Water is used intensivelv in the Sichuan Province and the discharge of wastewater in one
location quickly becomes the raw water supply source for a downstream irrigation. domestic
or industrial user. The improvement of the qualitv of this supply will have obvious positive
effects on the productivity of agricultural land and reduction of treatment system costs for
domestic and industrial users. These benefits accrue to entities that are not directlv paying for

the improvements. emphasising the need for a comprehensive SUEP viewpoint relative to
costs and benefits of improvement schemes.
Although this project onlv provides preliminary treatment. it forms the basis for long-term
wastewater treatment facilities for Leshan. The proposed Zigong Water Supplv Project will
have its new intake structure located downstream of Leshan on the Min. There are also manv
other domestic water intakes located along this reach of the Min.
Aesthetics and Water Amenitv
The surface waters in Leshan form  a major backdrop and focus in the city and the
improvement of water quality and sanitary conditions along these rivers will greatly improve
the city aesthetics.  Urban renewal efforts are already underway in the city to replace
dilapidated buildings with river-side parks and water amenities.
Tourism is a major industry in Leshan and economic development plans include a significant
increase in tourism into the future. The waterwavs in Leshan have historically formed focal
points for economic and tourist activities and the citv should reap these benefits with the
implementation of this scheme.
E 6.2 Potential Short Term Construction Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 6.2.1 Impacts
Relocation and Compensation
The Leshan wastewater project will require 16 mu of,land for the pumping stations. There
will be 53 households with 160 people requiring resettlement. The people are existing urban
dwellers and will not require new emplovment. The RAP includes cost for the temporarv and
permanent land. temporarv and permanent agricultural damage, and demolition cost. Total
RAP costs are approximately 7.7 million Yuan. The RAP will be implemented by the City
municipal government.
DemolitionISpoils
There is minimum demolition required for this project component and the issue has been
covered in the RAP for the project. No obvious impact will arise since no farmland. green
belt. public facilities or residential houses in the project site. The waste soil of 19 00om'.
resulted from the construction. will be used for back fill or disposed of after completion in an
approved location.
Voise acnd Du.st
Other impacts wvill be caused by the construction such as noise. dust and partial soil erosion.
The noise. intensity in the range of 80-95dB(A), comes from the operation of excavators. pile
hammers, mixers. various vehicles and other engineering machines. In the central urban area
of the citv. the construction is to be undertaken on both sides of the Zhugon= Xi River. along
the No. 12 Road on the west side of the Min River and the Binjiang Road on the north side of
the Dadu River.
According to the Report on the Environmental Qualitv of Leshan. in most of the area along
both sides of the Zhugong Xi River. the current noise is in the range of 55-65dB(A). In areas
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                     E-50                          DECEMBER 1998



SICICUAN URBAN ENVIRON,IMENT PROJECT                        ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSNENT
Volui3ii 3 - Appundi.x E
along the No. 12 Binjiang Road, the noise mainly comes from traffic with intensity ranging
from 65-7OdB(A) except for that of 70-75dB(A) in the area between Zhanggongqiao to the
Min Bridge. The additional noise will be a problem to the governmental organisations,
various enterprises and residents situated along the construction site, and it will be even worse
during night-time.
Limiting construction to the daytime hours wvill mitigate noise problems. The pipeline will be
excavated using manual labour in many cases so dust and noise will be minimised. During
the construction operation of construction equipment and the running of vehicles will
generate noise. The noise levels will depend on the types and numbers of machines and
vehicles. Generally their noise levels range from 80 to 90 dB(A). The construction noise will
have adverse impact on people living near the construction site or along the highway. In
order to meet the requirements specified by Boundary Noise Limits for Construction Sites
(GB12523-90), night-time construction activities will be prohibited, with the use of trucks
and equipment prohibited by 23:00 hr each day (except for road crossings which may be
allowed to minimise daytime construction impacts).
If it is necessary to utilise groundwater pumps, they will be provided with appropriate noise
and vibration protection devices. This will be especially important for night-time dewatering.
Mitigation measures will be required as well as monitoring.
Management practices are recommended to minimise erosion and runoff from storage piles
and for site clean up after construction is completed.
Transportation
There are minimal road crossings required and operational and scheduling plans have been
developed to minimise traffic impacts. In the downtown area. the recommendation is to
construct road crossings at night to minimise traffic problems. However. the previously
mentioned noise problems may cause concerns with night construction.
Safety Issues
The pipe trenches will be excavated by hand in sand and gravel strata. Wide battered trenches
or steel trench supports will be used in order to protect against trench collapse. Strict safety
measures will be recommended.
Putblic Facilities
Access to the major urban corridor and public buildings will be temporarilv disrupted bv this
constrmction. In addition. there will be major construction impacts along the waterways and
parks and boat docks in the centre of the citv. It will be important to minimise these impacts

E 6.3 Potential Operational Phase Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 6.3.1 Impacts
Sewlaige (herflows (collection, pump stationsi
Raw  sewage will be allowed to bypass the pumping stations during electrical outages or plant
operational problems. The pumping station wet wells will provide only a short-term buffer
for such situations and raw sewa-e will be soon bvpassed under these circumstances.
However, it is not considered cost-effective to provide either larger storage for these
situations or alternative power supplies. Raw sewage currently discharges to surface waters
untreated. As such, the large cost to mitigate this situation is not deemed appropriate during
Phase I of SUEP.
Inuzstrial Wyaste &fpsets
There is an industrial contribution to the Leshan wastewater facilities and there is an unknown
level of pre-treatment in this area. However, the major industries in the urban area have their
wastewater collected by an industrial interceptor that discharges at the Min and Dadu
confluence. There is a possibilitv of industrial waste problems for the sewer svstems and
pump stations but the limited sampling conducted by the SRIEP indicates that the risk of this
is small.
Noise
Monitoring of the acoustic environment in the area was conducted by SRIEP. The monitoring
was conducted in accordance with methods detailed in the Urban Regional Noises Methods
(GB/T14623-93). Monitoring was conducted at the future WwTW site and the major pump
station site (Nr 3 PS). The Class B limits of the Urban Regional Noise Standards (GB3069-
93) were adopted and the standards are as follows:
Day time:            Laeq   60dB
N ight time:         LAcq   5OdB
The monitored values showed that the acoustic environment in the future WwTW site and the
pumping stations was quite good and is able to meet the requirements of Class B of the Urban
Regional Noises Standards(GB3096-93). Mitigation measures will be included in the pump
stations to prevent noise pollution in the vicinitv. Pump station Nr 3 will be especially
important because of its location in the urban tourist area and the Grand Buddha protection
zone.
Odouirs
There is a possibility of slight odours being produced at the three pump stations but it should
not be severe under normal operations. The pump station design will include modern
ventilation svstems to dissipate any localised odours.  In the large Nr 3 pump station
downtown. it will be important to direct the ventilated air toward the Dadu river and away
from the adjacent park and public walkways.

Effluent water quality impact
Currently. about 76 000 m; domestic sewage is discharged per dav in the urban area of
Leshan. and 87% of it is disposed into the Leshan section of the Min River directly or
indirectly without any treatment. The water quality in the Leshan section of the Min River is
affected bv the municipal domestic sewage. and the concentration of the main pollutants is
obviouslv higher after passing through the urban area than upstream. The number of coliform
bacillus exceeds the standard by three times and the index of CODMfl and NH3-H are at the
critical level of exceeding the standard.
The construction of the interceptor sewer system is proposed to be completed in 2010 with an
intercepting capacityv '54 000 m3, accounting for 70% of the total discharge. This will reduce
the pollutant load bv more than 60% in the Leshan section of the Min River. which will
improve the water qualitv of this section and in the vicinity of the Grand Buddha.
As mentioned. the wastewater facilities proposed for Leshan under phase I of SUEP consist
oniy of preliminarv treatment. As such. the overall pollutant loading to the downstream Mmin
River is not measurably reduced. Of greater impact will be the removal of the wastewater
from the urban centre. Raw sewage bypasses caused by power or mechanical failure will
cause a localised impacts in the urban centre but these should be infrequent and the risk can
be minimised by proper maintenance.
Screenings treatment and disposal
The Leshan wastewater facilities includes three pump stations. Pump stations I and 2 contain
coarse screening only with a 500 mm mesh screen for pump protection. Screenings will be
collected. dewatered and hauled to the landfill. Liquids from dewatering will be returned to
the pump station.
Pump station Nr 3 is located in the downtown area at the junction of the Min and Dadu rivers
and it will convey all the wvastewater flow across the Dadu to the temporarv outfall location.
A WwTW will be constructed south of this outfall location in a future phase of the SUEP.
The Nr. 3 pump station will have both coarse screening at 500 mm and fine screening to 5
mm. as well as some provision for grit removal. There will be a significant production of
screenings and grit in this location. The original citv proposal was to remove this material via
a river barge for disposal elsewhere. However. there no suitable disposal site was identified
for this material. Hence. the design is being modified to include some screenings dewatering.
storage and transport of compacted screenings and grit to the improved sanitary landfill for
disposal. All three pump stations will require hauling of material to the landfill. but the Nr 3
pump station will produce significantly more material.
It will be important to prevent disease vectors. insects and odour problems in the storage area
since this is a verv visible site in the tourist area. Manv boats leave this area for tours of the
river near the Grand Buddha. SRIEP also indicate that this area is located in the protection
zone for the Grand Buddha. which will also require extra care.  The control of these
screenings will be an operational problem and the mitigation plan will call for inspections and
monitoring of these procedures.

SICIIUAN URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT. ENVIRONMENTAl. ASSI'SSMENT

O&M Problems
The risk during operation of the wastewater facilities refers to sewage discharges to rivers at
the pump stations in the urban area rather than being transferred downstream of the city and
the Grand Buddha. In order to avoid this situation happening, the following measures are
recommended:
Various items of equipment at the pump stations must be good qualitv with
proper and reasonable control and test apparatus and effectivelv monitored.
A secure power suppiv is a prerequisite for ensuring proper operation. so a
secondary, back-up power supply source should be considered so that power
failure can be avoided.
Organic Loading and Standards
This concern related to the potential for the wastewater, facilities influent concentrations of
organic pollutants to be either much greater than or much less than the design parameters. As
mentioned previousiv, the lack of significant industrial loading to the sewers and pump
stations due to the existence of the industrial interceptor greatly reduces this risk. In addition.
the SRIEP monitoring of existing sewers in Leshan does not provide evidence of potential
problems. Since the WwTW construction is being delaved to a future phase of SUEP. the
concerm for this project is mainiv the safetv of the sewerage collection and pumping system.
as wvell as for workers maintaining the svstem.

E 7.1 Positive Impacts (Local, Basin)
W'Vater Qualitv Improvements
The urban area of the Mianvuan River conveys an annual average flow of 45 m'/s but this can
drop to effectively zero flow during the dry season. As such. the dry-season base flow of the
MianVuan will consist mainiv of the wastewater effluent from the proposed treatment works.
The collection and treatment of 100 000 m5'/d of domestic and industrial wastewater within
Deyang will have major water quality improvement benefits for the Mianyuan river within
Devang and significant but smaller benefits to the downstream Tuo River. The proposed
project will be a significant step towards the recoverv of these surface waters but will not be
sufficient to enable them meet the targeted Class 3 surface water standards without other
major interventions. The current polluted conditions result from a combination of factors
including rural loads (natural and agricultural sources). urban loads (domestic. industrial and
non-point sources) and insufficient base flows at certain times of the vear. In addition, no
improvement of the water quality of the Shiting River will be achieved in the urban area
because the citv sewerage plan will not divert direct wastewater discharges to the WwTW
until later Phases of the SUEP.
The urban pollution impacts assessment assessed the potential water quality impacts of
proposed SUEP projects through the use of a water quality index. The proposed WwTW will
brine about a significant improvement in water qualitv in the Mianyuan river and will sli2htlv
improve the quality of the upper Tuo. The qualitv of the upper parts of the Mianyuan could
also be improved bv reducing BOD discharges from the paper mills.
The first phase SUEP projects. including the Deyang WwTW, are designed to start the
process of surface water improvement (as well as the adjacent groundwater system). Future
phases of the SUEP will address control of the other rural and urban pollution sources. as well
as potential river-flow (flow augmentation) and stream channel enhancements.
Sanitation and Public Health
Manv stagnant water ponds have been formed along the Mianyuan. The urban wastewater
flowing into the river and the pollution of the surface water, especially the worsening of the
water qualitv in the ponded areas. aggravate the pollution of the water environment. After the
WwvTW removes the raw wastewater from the river. it is estimated that the condition of many
ponds in the river-bed will aradually improve. The outvard appearance of the water will
greatly improve.
One of the most tangible and direct benefits of this wastewater collection and treatment
scheme will be the removal of the raw domestic and industrial overflows to the local drainage
and surface water systems in the city (except for emergency bypass conditions).  The
pollutants in municipal wastewater are suspended and dissolved solids consisting of inorganic
and organic matter. nutrients. oil and grease. toxic substances. and pathogenic micro-
organisms. Urban stormwater can contain the same pollutants, occasionally in surprisinglv
hiyh concentrations. Human wastes that are not properiv treated and are disposed of at the
point of origin or collected and carried away (night soil), pose risks of parasitic infections

(through direct contact with faecal material), hepatitis and various gastrointestinal diseases
including cholera and typhoid (through contamination of water supplies and food).
When wastewater is collected but not treated properly before disposal or reuse, the same
public health hazards exist at the point of discharge. For the receiving waters. additional
harmful effects will occur such as: habitats for aquatic life are impaired bv accumulated
solids: oxygven is depleted bv decomposition of organic material: and aquatic organisms mav
be further harmed bv toxic substances. which mav spread to higher organisms through
bioaccumulation.
Dowvnstreanm WVater Use
The main surface water source in Deyang is the Mianvuan River, which has an average
annual catchment run-off of 466 million n'n. Since much of the water is removed upstream by
the Gongnong Canal to irrigate farmland, the flow rate in the cit,Y section in drv season is very
low and is sometimes zero. The water is so severely polluted that it cannot be used as a water
source for the citv, which results in the use of groundwater. Downstream of Devang,
Lianshan Township uses the Mianyuan river for a potable water supply, indicating the
seriousness of this water quality problem, as do other domestic users further downstream in
the Tuo basin.
Water is used intensivelv in thie Sichuan Province and the discharge of wastewater in one
location quickli becomes the raw water supply source for a downstream irrigation. domestic
or industrial user. Downstream cities that utilise the Mianvuan River will benefit bv having a
higher quality raw water for treatment. The improvement in the quality of this suppiv will
have obvious positive effects on the productivitv of acricultural land and the reduction of
treatment system costs for domestic and industrial users. These benefits accrue to entities that
are not directly paving for the improvements, emphasising the need for a comprehensive
SUEP viewpoint regarding the costs and benefits of improvement schemes.
.4esthetics and WVater A menirv
The surface waters in Deyane form  a major backdrop and focus in the citv and the
improvement of water quality and sanitarv conditions along these rivers will greatly improve
the cirv aesthetics.  Urban renewal efforts are already underway in the citv to replace
dilapidated buildingos wvith river-side parks and water amenities. Waterways historically form
focal points for economic and tourist activities and the city should reap these benefits with the
implementation of this scheme.

Relocutiot? Calict Cotmpensaiion
The Devang WwTW project will require 159 mu of land. Twenty four households with 108
people require resettlement.  For the pipeline. temporary land acquisition of 22 mu is
required. The RAP includes cost for the temporary and permanent land. temporary and
permanent agricultural damage. and demolition cost. The total RAP cost is 20.8 million
Yuan. The RAP will be implemented by the City municipal government (see RAP for further
details).

Demolition/Spoils
There is minimum demolition required for this project component and the issue has been
covered in the RAP for the project. Surplus spoil arising from interceptor construction will be
used to construct the proposed I km long flood wall, adjacent to the WwTW. or for raising
the WwTW site to provide flood protection.
Noise and Dust
Heavy load trucks for transporting pipes are mobile and intermittent sources emitting
significant noise during pipe laving. with noise levels in the range of 85-90 dB(A). The noise
impact should not be significant since they will only operate in the daytime. they are less
frequent than vehicle flows on existing roadways. and the sites are not near urban areas. The
pipeline will be excavated using manual labour so dust and noise will be minimised.
Limiting construction to the davtime hours will mitigate noise problems. The pipeline will be
excavated using manual labour in many cases so dust and noise will be minimised. During
the construction operation of construction equipment and the running of vehicles will
generate noise. The noise levels will depend on the types and numbers of machines and
vehicles. Generallv their noise levels range from 80 to 90 dB(A). The construction noise will
have adverse impact on people living near the construction site or along the highway. In
order to meet the requirements specified by Boundary Noise Limits for Construction Sites
(GB12523-90), night-time construction activities will be prohibited. with the use of trucks
and equipment prohibited bv 23:00 hr each day (except for road crossings which may be
allowed to minimise daytime construction impacts).
If it is necessarv to utilise groundwater pumps. they will be provided with appropriate noise
and vibration protection devices. This will be especially important for night-time dewatering.
Mitigation measures will be required as well as monitoring.
Management practices are recommended to minimise erosion and runoff from storage piles
and for site clean up after construction is completed.
Dust emitted from house dismantling and building construction of the plant will have adverse
impact on the environment. In addition. activities such as pipe laying. earthwork and filling
also generate tlying dust and cause air pollution. However. the impact of tlying dust will be
temporary. localised and limited to the construction period.
Tiransportu tion
There are minimal road crossingis required and operational and scheduling plans have been
developed to minimise traffic impacts.
Saetev Issues
The pipe trenches will be excavated by hand. except in rock. when stratum consist of sand
and gravel materials they will require wide/battered trenches in order to protect against trench
collapse. Strict safetv measures will be recommended.
Public Facilities
The proposed project neariv has minimal impact on public facilities. houses and traffic.

Wastewater quantities rising from construction activities will be small and mainly domestic

E 7.3   Potential Operational Phase Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 7.3.1 Impacts
Sewage Overflows (collection, punmp stations. plant)
Raw sewaye will be allowed to bypass the WwTW during electrical outages or plant
operational problems. The WwTW wet well at the inlet to the plant will provide onlv a short-
term buffer for such situations and raw sewvage will be soon bypassed under these
circumstances. However. it is not considered cost-effective to provide either larger storage
for these situations or aiternative power supplies. Raw sewage currently discharges to surface
waters untreated. As sLIch. the large cost to mitigate this situation is not deemed appropriate
during Phase I of SUEP.
Industrial/ Wxtte L)psets
There is a lar-e industrial contribution to the Devang WwTW  (over 50%) and the level of
pre-treatment is unknown. There is a possibilitv of industrial waste upsets to the plant but
rigorous influent monitoring will be specified as well as operational plans to mitigate such
problems. The limited sampling conducted bv the SRIEP indicates that industrial upsets
should not be a problem.

Vofunm: 3- Appcndix E
Voise
Tanjiayoufang (Tanjia oil mill) is located in the south-east corner of Bajiaojing Township,
about I km away from the town centre. To the east of the mill is the Mianvuan River, and to
its west agricultural land. It has a workshop of Chanecheng Steel Factory to its north and an
alluvial mining mill to its south. It is open countrv with few farmhouses around. Except for
the noise from the production of the steel plant and the alluvial mining mill. there are few
other noise sources in the vicinitv. Ten acoustic monitoring points were selected by the
SRIEP to measure current noise levels in the proposed WwTW area. mostlv at the proposed
plant boundarv. The sound level at each monitoring point meet the requirement of the
standard limit for dav time while six of the points exceed the standard for night time. The 6
deficient points are situated near the alluvial mining mill: the high sound level is the result
of sieving and loading of gravel. It is reported that the mill is onlv a temporarv facilitv.
If there were no noise from the alluvial mining mill, the acoustic quality in the area could
reach the Class B standard specified in GB3096. Judging from the overall environment of the
location. the sound level should not have been verv high. Monitorin_ points 5# and 6# are
typical, where the sound level in davtime is 47.8 dB(A), and in night time lower than
46 dB(A).
The noise from the proposed WwTW comes mainly from the sewage-lifting pump, sludge-
lifting pump, and dewatering machine. Though most of these are installed underground. a
certain amount of the noise could spread to the outer environment because the noise proof
equipment can not totally diminish the noise. Among the noise sources, the sludge pump
house and sludge dewatering machine produce the highest noise. According to the site plan,
the sludae pump house and the sludge dewatering house are situated in the south-west end of
the site and there is a distance of 50 meters between the two noise sources. The dewatering
house is 15 meters away from the west boundarv of the plant.
The estimated future noise level values were predicted by a comparison with the measured
results of the outdoor sound level in the I' phase (100 000 m'/d) of Sanwavao WwTW in
Chengdu. When the five pumps are simultaneouslv working. the sound level at the nearest
west boundary of the plant is predicted to be 52 dB(A) and 49 dB(A) in davtime and night
time respectively. Accordina to the standard specified in the Noise Standard for Plant Area of
Industrial Enterprises. GB 12348-90. Class B (the value is equivalent to GB3096-93. Class B).
the sound level within the plant boundary can be controlled to the standard.
The noise at a point 120 meters from the piant boundarv is comparable with the existing
background noise at this point. 49.6 dB(A) and 48.5 dB(A) respectivel,v. which is up to the
standard specified in the Urban Regional Environmenital Noise Standard. GB3096-93.
Class B.
The oxidation ditch will not utilise blowers so it should cause the least amount of potential
noise  problems of the WwTWs constructed in the SUEP. If necessar,v. noise can be
controlled by the selection of imported low-noise equipment. construction of noise barrier
rooms. and providing greenbelts and trees to help absorb and diffuse the noise.

Odours
Oxidation ditches are adopted for the treatment of sewage in the proposed project, the treating
ability being 100 000 m;ld. In principle the technology has a lower risk of producing
offensive odours than conventional activated sludge plants.
Sanwavao WwTW was used bv SRIEP for modelling predicted odour problems. It is
considered a worst-case scenario because of the operational problems at Sanwayao coupled
with the large raw sewage bvpass occurring at the WwTW. With this predictive worst-case
modelling, a comparison was made between the estimated values and the standard values
specified in GB 14554-93 11.
According to preliminary estimates, the odorous chemicals from the project such as methyl
mercaptan can spread from the discharge source up to 500 meters from the works. With the
distance in the plant area deducted. the offensive odours affect an area up to about 250 meters
outside the plant area. As NE wind is dominant locally, the direction affected is the south-
west of the plant. Therefore, when determining the location for the project. residential
development on land up to 200 - 250 meters from the WwTW boundary should not be
permitted in order to reduce potential odour impacts on residents. The Changcheng Steel
Factory to the north end of the location and a couple of farmhouses to the south-west are
about 500 - 600 meters away and should avoid significant odour impact.
As there are many potential odour sources, odour could affect quite a large area. The location
of the outfall and the use of open tanks allows offensive odours to permeate the open air. The
following mitigation measures will be taken during the construction of the proposed project
and after commissioning:
Landscaping of the WwTW site and its boundary
Greenerv should take up 30% of the total area of the project. Emphasis should be put
on pollution resistance and air-purification when considering the plants tvpes. Flowers
and fruit trees should be planted in the plant are to make it more like a garden.
Personal Labour Hvyiene Protection
Irritants and bacteria carried with offensive odours access the human bodv through
contact or respiratorv system and can cause infection. Hence. it is important that staff
are given adequate training in hyvgiene practice and the correct operation of the works.
Pest-prevention
WwTWs are favourable places for the breeding of flies and mosquitoes. especiallv in
summer and autumn. Investigation of existing WwTWs and neighbouring farmers.
indicates that they believe that flies and mosquitoes tend to increase when the works
are commissioned. As flies and mosquitoes are carriers of various diseases. attention
should be paid to pest-prevention in the environment provided that the normal function
of the WwTW is not affected.
To summarise. the potential for local odour problems was a concern. particularly in view of
the existing odour problems at the Sanwayao WwTW in Chengdu. Problems at this facility
which mav be causing the odour problem include inefficient operation the sludge digestion
facilities. bvpasses of significant quantities of raw  untreated sewage every day. and

insufficient aeration due to poor operation and maintenance. Most of these problems are not
applicable to Deyang WwTW or should not be so severe. The site is in an agricultural area
and the use of recommended measures. such as a greenbelt and tree plantings. should also
mitigate any potential problems to a significant degree.
Effluent *vater qualirv inmpact
After the project is put into operation. the overall water quality of Mianyuan River will
improve due to the reduced pollutant load received by the river. However, the effluent from
the proposed plant will pollute a short section of Mianyuan River. In normal operation. the
WwTW has a capacity to treat 100 000 m'/d. According to the data provided by the design
unit. when the designed target for the reduction of the pollutants is attained, the control
indexes of BOD5, SS, NH3-N for the effluent will comply with the respective discharge
standard.
The calculation was based on the flow rate of Mianvuan River. The lowest flow rates occur
at Bajiao in the drv season. Flow rates (30 days average values) of 5.21m3s (P = 50%) and
3.69m;/s (P = 90%) were chosen for the analysis. The annual average flow rate of 15.36m3/s
was include in the forecast.
If the final discharge from the project meets the normal standard, the necessary river length
for an even mixture of pollutants and surface water in dry season (flow 5 - 6m'/s) is about
5 km. When the river flow rate is 3 .69m3/s (P = 90%), the concentration of BOD5 in the river
section does not meet the requirements for Class III water quality specified in GB3838-88.
However, the CODCr concentration meets the standard. When the surface water flow rate
equals the annual average flow rate (I 5.36m3/s), the densitv of both BOD, and CODcr in the
discharge from the project meets the standard for Class III surface wvater.
When the flow rate of the Mianvuan River more than 3.69m3/s. the water qualitv following
discharce of WwTW effluent from the project attains the standard for Class III after about 5
000m. After about 10 km. the densitv of most of the organic pollutants returns to the water
qualitv level upstream. The influence of the effluent discharge fades awayv radually in
downstream. In drv season. the water qualitv of the Mianvuan at Lianshan can meet the
standard for Class III specified in GB3838-88. The river water at Lianshan can be used of
with nlo threat from pollution.
If the treatment should fail. resulting in the sewage being discharged without being treated.
there will be surface water pollution for about 15-20 km downstream of the outfall river
section owing to the heavv load of water pollutants in the collected sewage. The degree of
the pollution and the length of the section are related to the surface water flow rate. Bv
calcLilation. a flow rate of about 35 m''s would be necessary to provide sufficient dilution for
the COD,r to reach the standard of 15 m/il. Similariv, a flow rate of more than 60 m'/s would
be necessarv for the dilution of the BOD; to reach the standard of 4 mg/l. Hence. abnormal
discharges from the project will have a severe impact on the utilisation of water at Lianshan
Township. However. such discharges should occur infrequentlv and it should be noted that
all wastewater is already currentiv discharged without treatment in the city.

Volumni 3 - Appendix E
Sludge treatment and disposal
Based on the density of SS and such metals as COD,,, BOD5 in the sewage, about 77 t/d of
siudge will be produced if the sewage treatment capacitv is 100 000 m3/d. This will contain
certain amounts of plant nutrient (such as N. P, and K) and could thus be used as fertiliser.
However. the sludge also contains some heavy metals from the sewage which could be
hanrnfil to crops and human health. In addition. the sludge will not be fully digested for
bacterial protection.
According to the currenit water qualitv monitoring- of the discharge water in the urban area.
the sewage contains Class I pollutants such as Hg. Cd. Pb. As. Cr(6. Compared with China
standards for metal content in agricuiltural farm sludge and based on limited sewer sampling,
the content of all the metal elements in the proposed WwTW sludge from the proposed
project could potentiallv meet the standard except that of Cd.
Sludge at the Devang WwTW  will be partially aerobically digested (extended aeration
facilitv) and dewatered. As mentioned previousiv. all digested and dewatered sludge will be
hauled to the existing Deyang landfill for final disposal.  The use of this sludge for
agricultural fertiliser has not been approved by the Provincial EPB.
The onlv operational concerns over the sludge management system is that sludge storage
facilities should be covered (main concern is the wet season rains) and a truck depot should
be constructed for loading sludge for transport to the landfill. At design conditions. the
Devang WwTW is predicted to produce 77 t/day of sludge, requiring 16 truck loads per da,y
hauling to the Devang landfill.
The landfill is 15 km away along Class I and Class 2 roads for 80% and 20% of the wav
respectively. SRIEP has reviewed the proposed hauling route and found there to be no
environmental problems associated with this proposal. Suitable provisions have been made
for dumping this sludge in the landfill. The sludge quantitv is estimated to be about 30% of
the MSW load from the citv that is landfilled (an equal amount is composted) under design
conditions and is not thought to have a large impact on landfill capacitv.
O&M Problems
There is a risk that during the operation of the WwTW. sewage flowing into the plant could
be discharged directil to the Mianvuan River due to power failure or mechanical problems in
the WwTW. The sewage average flow rate into the plant is 1.15 7 m's at design rates. To
avoid such adverse \vater quality impacts (described in detail above) occurring. the following
measures should be taken:
Various items of equipment used in the sewage treatment process. especialiv aeration
devices. must be maintained in good order with effective control. test and monitoring
apparatus.
Secure power supplies are a prerequisite for ensuring continuous sewage treatment
operation. hence duplicate power supplies are recommended so that power failure can
be avoided.

Volulne 3 - Appendix E
The water quality of influent to the sewage water treatment plant (ie. the concentration of
water pollutants) must be relativelv stable and the industrial wastewater sources must be
required to meet the relative pre-treatment discharge standard.  If industrial sewage is
discharged without adequate pre-treatment (especially strong wastewaters), the WwTW will
not meet the designed performance and expected standards.
The effectiveness of the sewage treatment will depend on the professional ability and sense of
responsibilitv of the staff or workers. On-the-job training and professional education for the
staff or workers is especially important.
The Sanwayao WwTW problems indicate that O&M could be a problem. The design of the
Devang WwTW has mitigated the design features but mitigation monitoring will need to
insure that the wastewater companv does not try to cut back on power consumption with
aeration. sludge digestion. etc.
Organic Loading and Standards
The first concern related to the potential for the WwTW influent concentrations of organic
pollutants to either be much greater than or much less than the design parameters for the
WwTW.
The influent domestic sewage at the Devang WwTW is still combined with stormwater that
causes lower concentrations of organic pollutants. The widespread use of septic tanks
upstream of sewers also contributes to these low loadings. The design values used for
Devang WwTW appear reasonable when compared to the limited sewer sampling results,
taking into account that the sewers have been separated. and septic tanks will eventually be
eliminated.
The concern over the potential for organic loading to be too high relative to design standards
is coupled with the second concern over the lack of COD design standards. The Deyang
WwTW  is a secondarv biological wastewater treatment works that can easilv handle normal
loadings of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater that has been adequately pre-treated at
the industries. Organic loadings that are higher than the design standards. including hi2h
COD loads. are indicative of problems with pre-treatment of industrial wastewater in the
sewerage catchment. The reported COD loadings in the Deyang WwTW sewerage catchment
mav indicate such problems. If such a problem occurs. the solution is for the EPB and the
Wastewater Company to applv and enforce adequate industrial pre-treatment standards. not to
apply unrealistic design standards on the Deyang WwTW.
The third potential concern related to the abilitv of the WwTW  to adequatelv remove
ammonia. and meet the discharge standards. The WwvTW has been designed and sized for
full ammonia removal. If the facility is operated as proposed. includina maintaining adequate
dissolved oxvuen in the aeration basin. full ammonia removal should be achieved. The
effluent ammonia concentrations should easily meet relevant discharge standards.

E 8    Zigong WwTW
E 8.1 Positive Impacts (Local, Basin)
Water QOualitv Inproverments
The collection and treatment of 120 000 mI'/d of domestic and industrial wastewater within
Zigong will have obvious water qualitv improvement benefits to the Fuxi River within Zigong
and the downstream Tuo River. The proposed project will be a significant step towards the
recoverv of these surface waters but will not be sufficient to enable them meet the targeted
Class 3 surface water standards without other major interventions. It is noted that this Fuxi
segment is currently classed for Class 4. but the overall provincial goal is to achieve Class 3
below all SUEP cities. The current polluted conditions result from a combination of factors
including rural loads (natural and agricultural sources), urban loads (domestic. industrial and
non-point sources) and insufficient base flows at certain times of the year.
The urban pollution impacts assessment assessed the potential water qualitv impacts of
proposed SUEP projects through the use of a water quality index. Zigong is built beside the
Fuxi River that has verv little baseflow. In the dry season the upstream flows are tvpically
less than I m'/s and sometimes fall to zero. Downstream of Zigong, the bulk of the river's
flow is raw sewage and industrial discharge and the concentration of pollutants is very high.
Because the quality of the river water is so much worse than the target qualitv, the river
pollution index indicates the Zigong WwTW will provide the greatest benefits of all proposed
wastewater treatment facilities. This confirmed its number one ranking in the earlier SUEP
scoring.
According to the data available industrial discharges are a much smaller source of pollution in
Zieong than domestic wastewater - 80% of pollution load is of domestic origin. The major
polluting industries in Zigong region are chemical works and sugar refineries and are located
on the lower sections of the Fuxi or on the Tuo where their impact is less. There is
insufficient baseflow in the river to dilute even treated effluent to an adequate degree. The
oniv way to achieve an acceptable water qualitv in the Fuxi is to construct storage upstreamT
or divert flows from another river and release this water during the drv season in order to
maintain a minimum dilution flow.
The first phase SUEP projects. including the Zigong WwTW. are designed to start the process
of surface water improvement (as well as the adjacent groundwater system). Future phases of
the SUEP will address control of the other rural and urban pollution sources as well as
potential river-flow (flow augmentation) and stream channel enhancements.
Stalnitation? andl Pub/ic Health
One of the most tangible and direct benefits of this wastewater collection and treatment
scheme will be the removal of the raw domestic and industrial overflows to the local drainage
and surface water svstems in the citv (except for emergencv bvpass conditions).  The
pollutants in municipal wastewater are suspended and dissolved solids consisting of inorganic
and organic matter. nutrients. oil and grease. toxic substances, and pathogenic micro-
organisms. Urban stormwater can contain the same pollutants, occasionally in surprisinglv
high concentrations. Human wastes that are not properly treated and are disposed of at the
point of origin or collected and carried awav (nightsoil), pose risks of parasitic infections

(through direct contact with fecal material), hepatitis and various gastrointestinal diseases
including cholera and ty-phoid (through contamination of water supplies and food).
When wastewater is collected but not treated properiy before disposal or reuse, the same
public health hazards exist at the point of discharge. For the receivine waters. additional
harnful effects will occur such as: habitats for aquatic life are impaired bv accumulated
soiids: oxygen is depleted by decomposition of organic material: and aquatic organisms mav
be further harrned by toxic substances, which may spread to higher organisms through
bioaccumulation.
Dowvnstream Water Use
Water is used intensivelv in the Sichuan Province and the discharge of wastewater in one
location quickly becomes the raw water supply source for a downstream irrigation, domestic
or industrial user. The improvement in the quality of this supplv will have obvious positive
effects on the productivitv of agricultural land and the reduction of treatment svstem costs for
domestic and industrial users. These benefits accrue to entities that are not directlv payin, for
the improvements, emphasising the need for a comprehensive SUEP viewpoint regarding the
costs and benefits of improvement schemes.
Aesthetics and Water Amenitv
The surface waters in Zicrong form a major backdrop and focus in the citv and the
improvement of water quality and sanitary conditions along these rivers will greatly improve
the city aesthetics.  Urban renewal efforts are alreadv underway in the citv to replace
dilapidated buildings with river-side parks and water amenities. Waterwavs historically form
focal points for economic and tourist activities and the citv should reap these benefits with the
implementation of this scheme.
E 8.2 Potential Short Term Construction Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 8.2.1 Impacts
Relocation and Compensation
The proposed WwTW and pumping stations will occupy 224 inu of land. most of which is
farmiand. The resettlement involves relocation of 33 farming households. containing 130
people. They will lose their livelihood due to land acquisition. so new employment will be
found. Land acquisition and resettlement will be carried out in accordance with the relevant
laws and regulations. The total RAP cost will be 10 million Yuan.
Demolition/Spoils
The project does not require a significant amount of demolition and the issue has been
covered in the RAP. There are no significant spoil issues with this project component. The
proposed sewer svstem has been located along the Fuxi river and thus. disruption. demolition
and relocation are minimised.

Volume;  - Appcndix E
Voise and Dust
The pipeline will be excavated using manual labour so dust and noise will be minimised. The
WwTW is located in an agricultural area, away from more crowded urban areas. Excavation
will produce dust that will have some localised impacts on the air environment. Noise
generated bv construction machinerv and transportation vehicles will have impacts on the
acoustic environment during the project construction. The estimated noise level is about'85
dB(A) although if percussion type piling is used this will result in greater noise. Since the
construction period lasts a iong time. noise and dust mitigation measures should be
implemented.
Noise generated by the construction of the interceptor will have some impact on the acoustic
environment in the urban area. The area where the WwTW and pumping station are situated
is in a low density population area and so noise will not have a major impact. If it is
necessary to use groundwater/dewatering pumps, they will be provided with appropriate noise
and vibration protection devices. This will be especially important for night-time dewatering.
Transportation
There are only a few road crossings required and operational and scheduling plans have been
developed to minimise traffic impacts. As mentioned, most of the construction will be along
the Fuxi river and this will not affect transportation except during the delivery of materials
and equipment.
Safety Issues
Any pipe trenches will be excavated bv hand. The ground conditions comprise sand and
gravel and trenches with battered sides will be used to protect against trench collapse. Strict
safetv measures will be implemented.
Public Facilities
10 km of pipelines will be constructed in the project. which consist of 7 km of interceptor and
3 km of pipelines across the river. The interceptor will be laid along the river and materials
will be stockpiled centrally off-site. so reducing land occupation at the site. The pipeline river
crossing and treatment works will be located in non-urban areas with relatively few impacts
on public facilities. houses and traffic.
Wastewater quantities rising from construction activities will be small and mainly domestic
sewaze produced bv wvorkers and equipment washing water (containina SS. CODc,, BOD5.
NH--N and petroleum derivatives. etc). Silt traps and septic tank should be built in the

E 8.3 Potential Operational Phase Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 8.3.1 Impacts
Sewage Overflows (collection, punmp stations, plant)
Raw sewaize will be allowed to bypass the WwTW during electrical outages or plant
operational problems. The WwTW wet well at the inlet to the plant will provide only a short-
term buffer for such situations and raw sewage will be soon bypassed under these
circumstances. However. it is not considered cost-etfective to provide either larger storage
for these situations or alternative power supplies. Raw sewage currentiv discharges to surface
waters untreated. As such. the large cost to mitigate this situation is not deemed appropriate
during Phase I of SUEP. It should be noted that the Fuxi River receiving waters will not meet
the recommended Class 3 surface water standards whether the treatment plant operates or not.
As such. the large cost to mitigate this situation is not deemed appropriate to the Phase I of
the SUEP.
Incustrial Waste Lipsets
There is a large industrial contribution to the Zigong WwTW (over 50%) and there is an
unknown level of pre-treatment in this area. There is a possibility of industrial waste upsets
to the plant but rigorous influent monitoring will be specified as well as operational plans to
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                                E-77                                  DECEvIBER 1998



SICHLUA-N URI3AN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT                      ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENIT
Volume i - Appenidix E
mitigate such problems. The limited sampling conducted by the SRIEP indicated that
industrial wastes could cause problems in Zigong. Zigong has prepared and is implementing
an industrial wastewater control action plan for the citv, with special emphasis on the acid
wastes found in the SRIEP sampling. The industrial source has signed a contract to remove
this waste from the facility rather than discharging to the sewer. This will have to be verified
in the mitigation monitoring during and following construction.
Noise
For an assessment of ambient noise levels, SRIEP identified a monitoring range in the urban
area of Zigong. Seven points were selected as ambient level monitoring points. Sound levels
at points 3. 6 and 7 exceed the standard during davtime and night time. The sound level of
point 5 exceeds the standard in the night time, whilst the sound level at the others points do
not exceed the standards.
During operation. air blowers for the aeration tank. sewage pumps and return sludge pumps
are the major potential noise sources with a sound level of 70-8OdB(A). Measurements
conducted in the Sanwavao Wastewater Treatment Works show that the operation of the plant
could have an impact the acoustic environment outside the plant boundarv. There is also an
issue of pump station noise in the sewerage collection svstem.
The WwTW site is relatively good because it is set in farmland. For monitoring of
background sound levels. one point was selected in the plant proper. The values specified for
the Class A of national standard. Urban Regional Environmental Noise Standard. GB3096-93
were used in the project area. ie. 55 dB(A) in the davtime and 45 dB(A) in the night-time.
The background values of the proposed plant site are 13.1 dB(A) and 4.2 dB(A) lower than
those of the standard in the davtime and night time respectively.  Hence. the existing
background noise situation in the plant site is relativelyv ood.
From the lavout plan of the treatment plant that there are two return-sludge pump houses.
each pump house has two sets of return-sludge pumps. one dutv and one standbv. SRIEP
considered that the pumps houses at the proposed WwTW are similar to Sanwavao WwTW
and hence the sound level out of the return-sludee pump houses at Sanwavao was used in the
analvsis. ie. 73 dB(A). Bv calculation the combined sound level from ' return-sludge pump
houses is 76dB(A). The plant has an air blower house which has 5 high speed centrifugal air
blowers. 4 dutv and I standbv. The sound level was predicted from that of the air blower
house of Sanwavao W%%TW. ie. 68dB(A).
The distance from the return-sludge pump houses to the eastern plant boundarv is 2 I m. at this
point the sound level is 50 dB(A): the air blower house is 62m away from the point. the sound
level is 32dB(A). Le = 4.1 dB(A) in the davtime and Leq 40.8 dB(A) in the niaht time were
selected as the background values. The forecast sound level at the eastern boundary is 5I
dB(A) in the davtime and 50.5 dB(A) at night.
In accordance with Class B of the Boundarv Noise Standard for Industrial Enterprises.
GB12348-90. the standard is 6OdB(A) for daytime and 5OdB(A) for night time. Hence. the
sound level at the boundarv in the davtime meet the standard. but does not exceed the
standard at night. Since the area of the eastern boundarv is verv small and there are no
residents nearby, noise will not have an impact. The forecast sound level at the northern
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                     E-78                         DECEMlvIBER 1998



SICtIiUAN URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT                      ENVIRONNIENTAL ASSESSNMENT
Volumc 3 - Appendix E
boundary is 44 dB(A) and the sound level at the western boundarv is 43 dB(A), both within
the standard.
Zhangjiatuo Pump Station is located in the urban area of Zigong City, the background sound
level is 75 dB(A) in the daytime and 53.3 dB(A) at night. The station is equipped with 4
sewage pumps, 3 duty and I standbv. Since the pump station lies in the areas beside the main
traffic lanes. Class IV of national standard, Urban Regional Environmental Noise Standard,
GB3096-93 is applicable, i.e. 70 dB(A) in the daytime and 55 dB(A) at night. The
background sound level of the pump station is 5 dB(A) higher than that of the standard in the
daytime and 1.8 dB(A) lower than that of the standard at night.
The sound level in the daytime within 3m of the Zhangjiatuo Pump Station is predicted to
exceed the standard. and the sound level at night within 16m around the station will exceed
the standard. The area which is affected by the noise is small. No additional mitigation has
been proposed by SRIEP but the sound levels should be monitored to determine if actual
sound levels meet predictions and whether additional soundproofing is required.
The environmental condition of Daijiaba Pump Station is similar to that of the plant site, so
the background sound level of the plant site is adopted. The pump station is equipped with 4
sewage pumps. 3 duty and I standby. The Class A of Urban Regional Environmental Noise
Standard should be achieved. ie. 55 dB(A) in the davtime and 45 dB(A) at night. The
backlground sound level of the pump station is 13.1dB(A) lower than that of the standard in
the daytime and 4.2dB(A) lower than that of the standard at night. The existing situation of
the background noise at the pump station is relatively nood.
The sound level in the davtime within 7m of the Daijiaba Pump Station exceeds the standard,
as does the sound level at niaht within 5Om of the station. Since the surrounding area is
farmiand which is far away from the farmers' homes. the effect is minimal. No additional
mitigation has been proposed by SRIEP but the sound levels should be monitored to
determine if actual sound levels meet predictions and whether additional soundproofing is
required.
Odozirs
A worst-case odour investigation and modeling exercise was carried out by the SRIEP. based
in large part on measured problems at the Sanwayao WwTW in Chengdu. This facilitv has a
varietv of operational problems that will not occur at the proposed WwTW in Zigong given
proper operation. As such. it is considered a worst-case scenario of potential odour problems.
The proposed Zigong WwTW is located in a mainly farming area. Some of the farmers living
less than 200 meters awav from the boundarv of the WwTW  plant will perceive offensive
odours from the plant. SRIEP proposes that residences within 200m of the WwTW are
relocated and also the WwTW is landscaped to mitigate potential odour.
The Sanwavao WwTW has historically had operating problems which have led to odour
problems including operation of sludge digestion facilities. large sewage bvpasses of raw
untreated sewage every dav and insufficient aeration. These problems are either not present
or should not be as severe at the Zigong WwTW. The site is in an agricultural area and the
use of a greenbelt and tree plantings should also mitigate anv potential problems to a
sianificant degree.

Effluent water quality impact
The proposed project has a design treatment capacity of 80 000 m3/d, and 80 000 m3/d of
treated effluent will be discharged to the Fuxi River every day at design flows. Based on data
available concerninig existing WwTW or those being designed in China. organic matter in the
effluent from those plants should mostly meet the requirement specified bv the discharge
standard. However, the river section immediately downstream of the discharges will still be
polluted to some extent. As a whole, the project -will significantly improve the water quality
of the Fuxi River. and thus improve the qualitv of the physical environment of the citv.
According to the forecasted results, in normal condition, treated sewage can meet the
discharge standard for concentration of CODNt,I in the 20 km of river section downstream.
However. BOD  and non-ionic ammonia concentration exceed the standard.   The
concentration of BOD in the I to 20 km of river section downstream exceeds the background
value by 7%. the concentration of non-ionic ammonia downstream of the outlet is lower than
the background value.
Following any bypass of the works the concentrations of BOD, COD and non-ionic ammonia
all exceed the standard within the 20 km of river section downstream of the outfall.
Generally, the treated sewage only has a small impact on the water quality of the Fuxi River
downstream of the outlet.
In the low water season. the low flows and inflatable flow control dams make the Fuxi River
operate as a reservoir, so SRIEP used a "narrow lake mobile model" in forecasting pollutant
impacts. The forecasted values are the same as the background values, which indicates that
the discharge only has little impact on the water quality of the river section downstream.
According to the above analysis, in norrnal condition. the treated sewage can meet the
discharge standard. which will not cause obvious impact on the water quality of river section
downstream of the outlet.
Sludge treatment and disposal
Sludge at the Zigong WwTW will be partially aerobically digested and dewatered. As
mentioned. all dewatered sludge will be hauled to the existing Zigong landfill for final
disposal. The use of this sludge for agricultural fertiliser has not been approved bv the
Provincial EPB. The only operational concems over the sludge management system is that
sludge storage facilities should be covered (main concern is the wet season rains) and a truck
depot should be constructed for loading sludge for transport to the landfill.
At desiazn conditions. the Zigong WwTW is predicted to produce 92 tidav of sludge. requiring
18 truck loads per day (using it trucks) hauling to the existing Zigong landfill. The landfill is
20 km from the city which requires significant hauling. SRIEP have evaluated the proposed
sludge hauling route which uses the highway adjacent to the WwTW. No particular problems
were noted with this hauling plan. At the landfill. a discharge station will be built to allow for
sanitarv dumping of the sludge to the landfill. This sludge production amounts to about 30%
of the current MSW loading to the landfill and will not affect the short-term life of the
landfill. Plans for expansion to Phase 2 of this landfill are already underway.

VoLume 3 - Appendix E
O&MProblems
Sanwavao WwTW problems indicate that O&M could be a problem. The design of the
Zigong WwTW has tried to mitigate these problems but monitoring will be need to insure that
the wastewater company does not tr,y to cut back on power consumption with aeration, sludge
processing. etc. Sewer svstem monitoring will also be required to ensure that industrial
wastewater does not damage pumping equipment or the WwTW.
Organzic Loading and Standards
The first concern related to the potential for the WwTW influent concentrations of organic
pollutants to either be much greater than or much less than the design parameters for the
WwTW. This concern is coupled with the concern over the fact that the Sanwayao WwvTW
does not meet national discharge standards, either for concentration or the percent removal of
organic pollutants. The influent domestic sewage at the Sanwayao WwTW is still combined
with stormwater that causes the low concentrations of organic pollutants. The widespread use
of septic tanks upstream of sewers also contributes to these low loadings. The design values
used for Zigong appear reasonable when compared to the limited sewer sampling results.
taking into account that the sewers have been separated, and septic tanks will eventuallv be
eliminated.
The concern over the potential for organic loading to be too high relative to design standards
is coupled with the second concern over the lack of COD design standards and the fact that
the Sanwavao WwTW does not meet the discharge standards for COD. The Zigong WwTW
is a secondarv, biological wastewater treatment works that can easily handle normal loadings
of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater that has been adequately pre-treated at the
industries. Organic loadings that are higher than the design standards. including high COD
loads. are indicative of problems with pre-treatment of industrial wastewater in the sewerage
network. If such a problem occurs, the solution is for the EPB and the Wastewater Company
to applv and enforce adequate industrial pre-treatment standards. not to apply unrealistic
design standards on the Zigon2 WwTW.
The third potential concern related to the abilitv of the WwTW  to adequatelv remove
ammonia. and meet the discharge standards. The WwTW has been designed and sized for
full ammonia removal. If the facilitv is operated as proposed, including maintaining adequate
dissolved oxvgen in the aeration basin. full ammonia removal should be achieved. The
effluent ammonia concentrations should easilv meet relevant discharge standards.

Volume S - Appendix E
E 9    Lesban Municipal Solid Waste Project
E 9.1 Positive Impacts (Local, Basin)
Solid Waste Collection and Treatment
The current MSW collection rate was estimated by the City of Leshan to be 41%. This
project will greatly assist the citv's efforts to 'increase this rate to nearer 80% by the vear
2000. The collection systems will be more mechanised, allowin,g more efficient collection
with less human contact with the solid wastes.
The current MSW disposal systems are wholly inadequate since the existing landfill operates
more or less as a waste dumping ground rather than as a sanitary landfill. The closed
incinerator has also been an environmental problem in the past. Implementation of this
project as outlined. will improve the adequate disposal of MSW in the city.
This project will supply criticallv needed MSW collection and disposal systems which will
allow the collection and removal rates to rise. the service area to expand, and the further
exploitation of economic development opportunities.
Sanitation and Public Health
The lack of adequate MSW collection svstems can contribute to a wide varietv of potential
public health concerns and the promotion of disease, vectors. and rodents. These potential
problems also occur when MSW collection involves a high degree of human contact. The
proposed SUEP project will alleviate these concerns and also provide a more attractive city
appearance.
Leshan is located at the junction of three major river systems and solid waste that is not
collected and disposed of properly will likelv end up in the surface waters. The rivers in this
area are currentlv highly degraded bv floating materials. This impact should be improved bv
this project.
Economic Developmenit
The supplv of adequate MSW collection and disposal svstems is a minimum need for
allowing the city to grow and develop economicaliv into the future. In addition. tourism is a
major existing and proposed economic activity in Leshan and the maintenance of a clean citv
will foster its image as a tourist destination.
.4esthetic and Enmjoyent
The surface waters in Leshan form  a major backdrop and focus in the city and the
improvement of water qualitv and sanitarv conditions along these drainage ways will greatly
improve the citv aesthetics. Urban renewal efforts are already underwav in the citv to replace
dilapidated buildings with river-side parks and water amenities. Improved trash collection
and reduced river-side dumping will enhance these efforts.
Tourism is a major industrv in Leshan and economic development plans include a significant
increase in tourism into the future. The waterways in Leshan have historically formed focal
points for economic and tourist activities and the citv should reap these benefits with the
implementation of this scheme.

Volume 3 - Appendix E
E 9.2 Potential Short Term Construction Impacts, Mitigation and Monitoring
E 9.2.1 Impacts
Relocation and Compensation
The landfill will require 284 mu. a significant land acquisition which will be carried out in
phases as the landfill expands. The RAP addresses land acquisition, the decreased output of
agriculture and forest products. and the relocation and re-emplovment of 37 households. The
proposed site currently comprises 72mu of cultivated land and 172mu of mountain forest.
The total land area to be occupied by the proposed landfill 284mu of which 40mu has already
been occupied by the existing waste dump. Of the remaining 244 mu, the first phase of this
project will occupy 60mu. The second phase will occupy 157mu. 27 mu will be used for
other uses such as administration and leachate treatment.
The total cost of the RAP is estimated as 25.87 million Yuan (see the RAP for a detailed
breakdown of the costs).
Demolition/Site Clearance
The existing MSW incinerator should be demolished as part of this project to prevent it being
used again for burning MSW. It constitutes a major potential air pollution source and should
be eliminated. Clearance of 172 mu of forest in several stages during the construction of the
landfill could have some influence on the ecological environment of this area. The wood is
classified as secondarv forest without any rare or protected plants; major tree species are
pine, cypress. Ligustrun. palm, orange tree and bamboo etc.
The animals in the area include Woodland frog, Swamp frog. Black-spot frog, Sparrow.
Black-eyebrow snake. Crow, Grass thrush. Black-tail snake. etc. No rare or protected animal
or fish spawning ponds are found in the area. Following forest clearance and disruption of
natural drainage patterns there will be short term potential for increased storm water runoff
and soil erosion. This will occur until the construction of the landfill drainaee svstems in the
area. Interim drainage and erosion prevention measures will be implemented during this time.
With completion of the project. landscaping of the completed landfill will control water and
soil erosion.
.Voise and Dust
There could be temporarv noise impacts from construction equipment and transport. The
noise levels could potentially be high but there are few residents in the area and no sensitive
receptors were identified. The site mainlv comprises fields and woodland and the dam will be
constructed in a valley. Hence. construction noise will be muffled by the hills.
It is recommended that operations are halted at night to mitigate any temporarv noise
problem. The predicted noise intensity is about 80-85dB(A). The noise source is mobile and
intermittent.
Transportation
Since the major construction associated with this project involves enlargement and
improvements to the existing landfill site and this site does not affect Leshan's urban
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                     E-87                          DECEMBER 1998

transportation network, this project will not have any significant additional impacts on
transportation in the area.
Safety Issues
The only serious construction related issue relative to safety will be the careful management
of leachate and  gas produced  from   the existing  landfill while the enlarged  and  improved
landfill operation is put into place. Special care will need to be made to ensure the safety of
construction workers and nearby farmers.
Public Facilities
Leshan Citv is an historic citv with manv cultural relics. No cultural relics or public facilities
lie within the landfill site area and hence, they should not be affected by the project

Inadeqc,ate Collection and Transfer Systems
The MSW  landfill improvements have been coupled with improved collection and transfer
systems in an attempt to improve overall MSW systems in Leshan. As such, the potential
problem of inadequate systems to collect and transfer solid waste to the landfill should be
minimised. However. there is a small possibility that the city's plans for collection and
transfer systems are not adequate to meet the changing needs of the urban area. The landfill
option is able to cope w ith variations in the quantities of MSW  delivered.
Industriul W`aste - Potenmial for Toxic/Ha:ardous Contamination
There are regulations against the dumping of industrial toxic and hazardous wastes in the
municipal landfill.  However. the level of enforcement of this regulation is unknown.  In
addition. the disposal of hazardous materials from household use will also be increasing with
increasing affluence.  It will be important to trv and keep such wastes out of the improved
landfill so that the site does not require future clean-up as a hazardous waste site.

SICIIUAN LURBAN ENVIRONMEN T PROJECT                       ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSNIENT
Volume i - Appcndix E
No ise
In the urban area, the noise sources will be the collection trucks, transfer stations, and street
sweeping equipment. The vehicular use of trucks and cleaning equipment will have to be
handled by management practices (such as hours of operation and equipment maintenance).
SRIEP has reviewed the transfer station site and found it to be suitable relative to noise and
other issues.
In the landfill, the main sources of the noise are the working bulldozer. roller, pump and other
transport vehicles .The intensitv of noise is 80-90 dB(A), It has some influence on the
acoustic environment around the site. Imported compaction equipment is specified and this
equipment should be less noisy. During the landfilling operations. activities should be timed
to reduce the influence of the noise on the surroundings.
On the basis of the project analvsis, the landfill sound levels are all < 90dB. hence they can
reach the Factorv Boundarv Noise Standard for Enterprises. Class B of GB12348-90, ie it is
less than 60dB dav and less than 5OdB night at a distance of 100m. From the distribution of
the sound source, it can meet environmental requirement.
Air Pollzttion and Odours
During the operation period (especially in summer), each landfill unit or area will generate
some offensive odour before cover material is added. The intensity of those pollutants will be
up to Class C. and the concentration of source intensity will be 2 mg/mi, including H2S at
0.06 m2/m3 and mercaptan at 0.04 mgmr'.
The local environmental conditions were assessed according to "Pollution Control Standard
for Domestic Solid Waste Landfill (GB16889-1997)".  On the basis of the proposed
operation. after clay sealing the bottom and covering the refuse, the offensive odour will be
minimised. Each landfill cell is covered with soil. so the extent of refuse exposed to the
open-air at any one time is small. The landfill will thus meet the standard, based on the
identified site boundarv. However, in the summer season. there are both higher temperatures
and bacterial grovwth. In order to protect the employees' health, disinfection and sterilising
work will be carried out.
Leachate Disposcal and Mixing
After the landfill site goes into operation. it is predicted to produce 100 t/day of leachate on
average during the wet season. The concentration of BOD and COD in the leachate is 1 000
to 3 000ma/l and 2 000 to 7 000mg/I. respectively. It could effect the water quality of the
Dashi River and the Min River. Recirculation of the leachate back to the operating MSW
disposai cells can minimize the overall quantity of leachate and hence the quantity requiring
treatment. A collecting ditch in the site will direct the leachate into a balancing tank where it
will be pumped back to the working cell. Such methods are used widely in developed
countries but experience in China is limited.
According to the theoretical calculation made by the design consultants. using meteorological
data of rainfall and evaporation in Leshan. the treated quantitv of the leachate can be reduced
by 60-70% after the recirculation. The pollution concentration of the leachate will be reduced
by 40-50% according to the experience of the operation in foreign countries. Recirculation
can reduce the scale and capital investment required for the leachate treatment station.

SICHUAN URBAN ENVIRONMIENT PROJECT                         ENVIRONNIENTAL ASSESSNIENT
Volumc 3 - Appendix E
A treatment station for the refuse leachate will be built in the sanitary landfill site in Leshan.
The designed scale is 100 m3/d. The performance specification for the leachate treatment
plant has been based on meeting the requirements of the new standard for landfill wastewater
discharges, GB 16899-1997 for flows of up to 100 m3/dav. which requires reducing:
COD   from   5000 mg/I    to        300 mg/I
BOD5  from    1500 mg/I    to       150 mg/I
NH-   from   300 mgi/       to      25 mg/l
The leachate treatment plant will consist of anaerobic and flocculation processes with an
oxidation pond. Space for a disinfection facility using UV or chlorine has been allowed in
order to control bacteria levels if this is required at a later date. Similar designs are working
in Hangzhou and Guangzhou. Recent operating data provided on a landfill in Shao Xing in
Ze Jiang Province indicates a similar leachate treatment plant has been successfully meeting
discharge standards since 1993.
The leachate discharged into the Dashi River flows into the Min River after 5.5 km. The
Dashi River is mainly a flood-relief channel. The SRIEP forecasted the impact of discharged
leachate on the Dashi River and the Min River. The Dashi River has minimal flows in the dry
season and from observation, appears to be very polluted.
The norrnal flow in the Dashi River is, I to 2 m3/s. the average flow in the dry season is 0.5
m;/s. So, dilution mixing model was adopted for forecast. The conditions for two scenarios
were considered: (a) The treatment station operates normally, the leachate discharge can meet
the discharge standard after being treated: (b) The treatment station breaks down. the leachate
is discharged directly without any treatment.
In view of the above-mentioned conditions. the standard discharge of the leachate after
treatment will neither adversely impact on the Dashi River. which meet Class Ill of the
Standard before joining into the Min. nor the Min River. If the treatment station breaks down
and the leachate discharges directly to the river without any treatment, CODM. and BOD5 in
the Dashi River will exceed the requirement specified by Class lIt of the water body standard.
GB3838-88. Although data was not supplied. it is highly likely that the Dashi River already
exceeds Class III standards. The forecast produced by two-dimensional model shows water
in the Min River will still meet the Class III of the standard when it receives the water from
the Dashi River. However. there will be localised impacts on the farmers and other users of
the water downstream of the landfill.
The engineering geological survey report of Leshan Refuse Sanitary Landfill Site shows that
there are no harmful geological features in the landfill site region including landslide. slide
and mud-rock tlowv etc. The natural slope is stable in the region: the leakage in the land layer
of the site region is caused by heavy and medium weathering of rock layers. crevices and poor
drainage. so water in the site is hard to leach from the sides. Leachate will be drained beneath
the dam bottom of the refuse site along the ditches (check).
The bottom of the refuse site will be clay and any crevices and large cracks that occur will be
sealed with cement grout. While digging the dam basemrent to the designed depth, cement

grout will be used to seal the rock foundation, thus reducing the leakage rate, at the dam
bottom and prevent leaking of leachate. In view of the above, the leachate of Leshan Refuse
Sanitary Landfill Site is not predicted to have an impact on the water qualitv of groundwater
if the measures above are carried out under strict site management.
Gas Production
There will be 44 collecting gas wells in the landfill area according to the design. A gas
collection station (LxBxH=30mx10mx7.2m) contains a control room, distribution room.
room for gas treatment and some space for utilising the gas in future. The condensation
drainer removes the saturated vapour in the gas. The collected gas is burned in from a flare
stack. The flare stack is placed on an concrete foundation in the south-west corner of the gas
treatment station. The flare stack (Type C8, N= 15kw) is imported and has a burning capacity
of 600 m3/h. The decomposition rate of organic matter in the site depends on the factors of
refuse/solid waste composition and water content etc. and the latter can be controlled.
The speed rate of biogas production by organic waste decomposition is difficult to predict and
control. However, the total amount of the gas production, can be controlled by adjusting the
water content and particulate size of the solid waste in the site. The total amount of the gas
production will reach its peak within two years. Then it will reduce gradualiv according to
the predicted data for gas production in Leshan Refuse Sanitary Landfill Site supplied by the
design engineers. Gas recovery and reuse is not initially contemplated because of the lack of
large industrial enterprises in the area.
Sludge/Screenings Loading and Problems
The landfill reportedlv receives septic tank sludge currently. although this is apparently used
mostly for agricultural fertiliser in a similar fashion as night soil. In addition, the landfill will
be receiving a rather large quantity of wastewater screenings from the three pumping and
screening stations that will be built for wastewater treatment under a separate SUEP project.
The final design of the landfill should provide a convenient method of dumping both sludges
and screenings so that the normal operations and compaction are not affected.  Both
substances should be mixed with dry MSW and spread rather than put into separate ponded
areas that would be subject to overflow and would make compaction difficult.
O&f Problemns cand Ecpense
During the period of landfilling, refuse will produce a great amount of biogas. According to
the refuse treated volume in 2005. the volume of biogas production will be about 2.413 x 10
ma/a and in 2010. it will be 3.242 x 10 m'/a. The composition of biogas is mainly methane
and carbon dioxide. Thev can cause fire and explosion without proper handling. The landfill
design addresses such concerns but proper operation and maintenance will be essential.
The supervision and management of landfill sites is very important. Mismanagement mav
cause the following problems:
Urban refuse cannot be collected and transported to landfiil sites in a timely and
complete way. so landfill sites cannot function normallv.
The spillage and leakage of the refuse along the roads will have a bad influence on
the urban landscape and sanitarv environment.
41367.EA.APPENDIXE                     E-92                          DECEMBER 1998

Volumne I- Appendix E
The mismanagement will result in the increase of flies and mosquitoes in summer and
the spreading of diseases.
The mismanagement of leachate will pollute surface water and groundwater.
Inadequate covering with clav, can cause foul smells to spread and the refuse to mix
with the surface or groundwater.
Whether the landfill site runs normallv depends on the supervision and management to a great
degree. ensuring that operational procedures are strictly adhered to. A strict operating system
must be laid down in the construction design. Every workman must work according to the
stipulated rules to guarantee the effectiveness of the landfill Site. The domestic refuse in
Leshan is usually held in dustbins and tanks, then transported to the transfer station of refuse.
The management of the refuse tanks and dustbins should be improved. The following must
be done:
Dump refuse at specific times and locations.
Prevent scavengers spilling refuse in dustbins and tanks on the street resulting in
contamination of the urban environment.
Disinfect dustbins and tanks at regular intervals to prevent the spreading of diseases.
Guarantee that all of the refuse in dustbins. tanks and transfer stations can be
transported to the landfill site. Don't leave any future trouble behind in the city.
Vectors and Disease
Procedures specified for managing the landfill should minimise the breeding habitat for flies.
mosquitoes and rats. This will hopefullv protect the health of the people in the area
