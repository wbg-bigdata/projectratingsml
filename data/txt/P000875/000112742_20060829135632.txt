FIRST AND SECOND STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT CREDITS
(CREDITS 1777, A-025, A-025-1-GH and 2005, 2005-1, 2005-2-GH)
PREFACE
This is a Program Performance Audit Report (PPAR) on the First and
Second Structural Adjustment Credits in support of Ghana's structural
adjustment program, which reflects the shift in emphasis after 1985 of the
Economic Recovery Program started in 1983.      The first of these credits --
SAC I, Credit 1777-GH, African Facility A025 -- was approved in April 1987,
became effective at the end of May 1987, and was closed in June 1990.         A
supplementary credit from the African Facility A025-1-GH was approved in
October 1987, became effective a month later, and was closed in June 1990. The
second credit -- SAC II, Credit 2005-GH -- was approved in April 1989, became
effective in June 1989, and was closed in March 1991. SAC II Supplement (IDA
Reflows) Credits 2005-1-GH and 2005-2-GH were approved in October 1989 and
November 1990 respectively, and were closed in March 1991.      Cofinancing of
US$60.1 million was linked to SAC I, and US$153.9 million to SAC II.
The PPAR consists of the Program Performance Audit (PPA) prepared by
the Operations Evaluation Department (OED) and the Program Completion Report
(PCR) prepared by the Africa Region (Parts I and III) and the Borrower
(Part II). The PPA is based on the attached PCR, the President's Reports, the
credit documents, on a study of Bank files, and on discussions with Bank staff.
An OED mission visited Ghana in October/November 1991, and discussed the
effectiveness of the Bank's assistance with the Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning, the Bank of Ghana, the Cocoa Board, the State Enterprise
Commission and other relevant ministries and agencies. The mission also met
with representatives of the private sector.        Their kind cooperation and
valuable assistance in the preparation of this report is gratefully acknowl-
edged.
The PCR provides a good account and assessment of the program
experience.  The PPA elaborates on the strengths and weaknesses of the Bank's
performance and on the lessons to be learned.
The draft PPAR was sent to the Government of Ghana and cofinancing
agencies for comments.    The comments received from the co-financiers (KfW,
OECF, Sweden, and the EEC) are reproduced as Attachments to the report; no
comments were received from the Government.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     Throughout the 1970s Ghana's economy was dominated by public sector
production and commercial activities, and was badly managed. Support for the
pervasive, inefficient public sector led to large budget deficits, which in
turn fueled high inflation.   The fixed nominal exchange rate became grossly
overvalued, shifting relative incentives away from exports and leading to
deterioration of export performance and in the capacity to import. Declining
exports, imports and economic activity eroded the tax base and forced severe
cutbacks in Government social services, maintenance, and capital investment;
thereby undermining the once well developed social and economic infrastructure,
and further reducing productive capacity. Meanwhile, the policy environment
was distorted by the tendency of successive governments to 'respond to the
foreign exchange crises by increasingly restrictive import regimes, rationing
and price controls.   The lack of economic opportunities and declining real
wages led to an exodus of skilled Ghanaians and to the flight of capital. In
the early 1980's the grave economic situation was exacerbated by prolonged
drought, deterioration in the terms of trade, and the forced repatriation of
over a million Ghanaians from Nigeria.
1.02     In 1983, the Government of Ghana launched its Economic Recovery
Program (ERP) to stabilize the economy, restore creditworthiness, rehabilitate
the export sectors, and reverse the downward trend in GDP.         Substantial
progress was made in stabilizing the economy by 1985, specifically in reducing
inflation and the deficit in the overall balance of payments. In light of the
progress on stabilization issues during the first phase of the ERP, the
Government concluded that it was time to emphasize the restoration of growth,
for which further reform of the exchange rate regime, higher cocoa producer
prices, and greater efficiency in the public sector were necessary.
1.03     The ERP shifted toward a Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) which
included a macroeconomic stabilization component essentially continuing the
demand management begun in 1983 and a growth component containing measures to
expand exports and to improve mobilization of and efficiency in resource use.
Given the dominance of the public sector in resource use, the program called
for the reform of taxation to reduce distortions associated with the protec-
tionist policies of the past, reforms to improve public sector management --
better planning, budgeting and monitoring of expenditures, and more efficient
use of manpower -- not only in its central administrative apparatus but in the
large state-owned enterprise sector devoted to commercial and productive
functions.
1.04     The SAP attracted IMF support resulting in purchases of over US$600
million during 1987-90. Bank support was provided in the form of about US$250
million in structural adjustment credits plus over US$150 million in sector
adjustment credits and another US$77 in project/technical assistance credits.



There was substantial bilateral support, including US$215 million of co-
financing for the Bank's structural adjustment credits.
II. OBJECTIVES OF BANK SUPPORT
2.01     World Bank program support for Ghana's ERP took the form of two
Reconstruction Imports Credits, an Export Rehabilitation Credit and associated
Technical Assistance Project.     The shift toward structural adjustment was
supported by an Industrial Sector Adjustment Credit, two Structural Adjustment
Credits, a Financial Sector Adjustment Credit, and a       Program to Promote
Private Investment and Sustained Development.       Bank project lending for
Structural Adjustment Institutional Support, Public Enterprise Technical
Assistance, Cocoa Rehabilitation, and Economic Management Support also was
designed to assist the SAP.    While this is an evaluation of the Structural
Adjustment Credits I & II, there was considerable overlapping of objectives
with other operations in support of the SAP, and frequently the measures
directed at any objective were not unique to any one operation. This in turn
makes it difficult to ascribe specific impact to any subset of operations
within the group supporting the SAP.
2.02     In 1985, following consultations with the IMF and the Bank, the
Government decided to reorient the ERP to :
*   establish an incentive framework that stimulates growth, encourages
savings and investment, and strengthens the balance of payments; and
*   improve resource use, particularly in the public sector, and direct
resources to key areas of adjustment, while ensuring fiscal and
monetary stability.
2.03     The objective of SAC I was to support the following aspects of the
reoriented ERP, which was thence also referred to as the SAP:
a) trade liberalization, specifically:
* the merging of the two-tiered market for foreign exchange by using
the auction determined rate for all officially funded transactions,
thereby ending the exchange rate tax on cocoa and the subsidy of
oil imports;
* the removal of quantitative restrictions on imports, and related
tax and tariff reforms;
b) an incentive framework that stimulates growth through:
* cocoa sector policies leading to the receipt by growers of a larger
share of the f.o.b. price to be financed mainly by cost-cutting
improvements in the efficiency of the Cocoa Marketing Board.



-3-
c)  improved resource use in the public sector, through:
* changes in public expenditure and tax policy;
* state-owned enterprise reform;
* better public sector management.
2.04     SAC II (approved in FY89) supported a program with essentially the
same objectives, except that there was greater emphasis on tax reform and on
the promotion of private sector development than there was under SAC I.
2.05     One other objective of Bank support was to facilitate and coordinate
support by other donors, by sponsoring meetings of the Consultative Group for
Ghana.
III. IMPLEMENTATION AND IMPACT
ForeiRn Exchange and Trade Liberalization
The Exchange Regime
3.01     Before September 1983 the foreign exchange regime pegged the exchange
value of the Cedi to the US dollar at Cedi 2.75 = US$1.00. During the next
three years a series of discrete devaluations brought the exchange rate to
approximately Cedi 90 = US$1.00. In September of 1986 a dual exchange rate
system was set up, in which there was a fixed rate for cocoa exports and for
imports of petroleum products and essential drugs and an auction rate
determined by competitive bidding among holders of eligible import licenses.
Importers of consumer goods were not allowed to bid in the auction but had to
acquire foreign exchange in a parallel market where there was a premium of over
80% compared with the auction rate.
3.02     Under the structural adjustment program access to the auction has been
widened by the inclusion of additional categories of consumer goods and service
payments and the exchange market has been unified. First, the fixed rate for
cocoa,  petroleum,  etc., was abolished in February      1987 after which all
transactions through the banking system were settled at the rate determined in
the weekly auction. In 1988, the Government, on its own initiative, further
widened the exchange market by permitting the setting up of foreign exchange
bureaus, thereby redefining the legal system in such a way as to encourage the
absorption of the parallel market into the formal one.       Subsequently, the
spread between the bureau rate and the auction rate converged almost to the
point of disappearance. In April 1990, the retail auction was replaced by a
wholesale auction in which banks and licensed bureaus meeting the eligibility
criteria could participate. These dealers freely determine their bids at the
auction and sell to their customers and to other dealers at mutually agreed
rates.   In addition, in order to promote the development of an interbank
market, dealers are authorized to trade among themselves. The Bank of Ghana
may participate as a buyer or seller in this market.
3.03     Under the unified exchange market the exchange rate of the cedi is
determined freely in this two level market.     The retail market rate is the



effective rate except for customs valuation and official purposes for which the
auction rate is used. The official exchange rate between the cedi and the US
dollar has gone from 89.2 in 1986 to 326.3 in 1990 and to 358.8 during the
first half of 1991. The real effective exchange rate of the cedi depreciated
by 36% between August 1986 and December 1990. For all practical purposes the
cedi is now convertible.
3.04     The changes in the exchange rate and regime have:
*  improved economic incentives,    especially the profitability of
investment in the export sector and contributed significantly to
the 8% rate of growth in exports of goods and non-factor services
during 1986-1990;
* permitted increased access to imported inputs and in turn helped
to rehabilitate the productive base;
* facilitated fiscal adjustment by maintaining the buoyancy of
revenues from taxes on international transactions;
*  aided trade liberalization;
*  depoliticized the exchange rate by eliminating government dominance
of the exchange market and making the rate in the public mind a
price like any other price; and
*  stimulated  flows of remittances from abroad     through official
channels.
Trade Liberalization
3.05     Until October 1986 imports were controlled within the framework of an
annual import program and licensing system dictated by foreign exchange
budgeting and exchange control considerations. There were two types of import
licenses -- specific and special.    Recipients of the former were allowed to
import goods not on a negative list (which included consumer goods) and to buy
the requisite foreign exchange from the banking system, while recipients of the
latter were allowed to import but could not receive foreign exchange from the
official system.   In general, exporters were allowed to retain only 20% of
foreign exchange earnings, the remainder had to be surrendered for cedis at the
exchange rate in the auction.  Exceptions were mainly gold exporters which had
larger retention rights and cocoa with lower retention rights.
3.06     Under the structural adjustment program supported by SACs I & II
consumer imports were gradually made eligible for financing throuph the foreign
exchange auction, and became 100% eligible by February 1988.-       The import
license requirement for access to the auction was phased out, and the system
finally abolished in January 1989. Meanwhile, during 1987-89 steps were taken
to liberalize current payments for invisibles, and by the end of 1989 only a

-5-
few minor restrictions remained. Parallel with the liberalization of trade,
fiscal reforms were introduced to reduce the distortions in trade taxation and
protection.   For instance, the customs duty on consumption goods other than
luxuries was reduced from 30% to 25%; the 10% tax on imports under the "special
imports" license was abolished; and sales and excise schedules were merged and
simplified by setting a common rate of 20% for most commodities. The foreign
exchange retention by exporters was raised from 20% to 35%.
3.07     Some aspects of trade liberalization were simultaneously pursued under
the sector adjustment program supported by the Industrial Sector Adjustment
Credit. These included (a) simplification of export documentation by abolishing
the permit to export; (b) redesign of the duty drawback scheme to remove the
tax element from exporter's cost; (c) study of pre- and post-shipment export
credit; and (d) reorganizing and strengthening of the Export Promotion
Council.
3.08     Liberalization of exchange and trade was accompanied by the gradual
removal of price controls. The Prices and Incomes Board now only gets involved
in determining the price of wheat from the single importer to millers to
prevent the former from taking advantage of monopoly power.     The Board also
monitors the cost components of cement in view of the lack of competition in
the cement market.     While the Board continues to monitor price trends,
generally price controls are no longer enforced.
Price Incentives
3.09     Action to improve price incentives to provide more remunerative prices
for exports focussed on cocoa. The nominal price received by cocoa growers was
increased from 56,600 cedi per ton in 1985/86 to 224,400 cedi in 1990/91. The
share of the f.o.b. price at the official exchange rate increased from 24% to
47% during the same period. Nevertheless, with the steep rise in the Consumer
Price Index from 4,245 (1977=100) to 17,933 and the fall in international cocoa
price from US$2,434 per ton in 1986 to US$1,270 in 1990, the real price to
cocoa producers (cedis/ton in 1977 prices) increased from Cedi(1977) 1,333 in
1985/86 to Cedi(1977) 1786 in 1987/88 but fell back to Cedi(1977) 1,251 in
1990/91. Clearly, the fall in real producer price would have been more severe
but for the increase in the share of export proceeds paid to the grower.    The
export of beans increased from 171,747 tons in 1985 to 260,001 tons in 1990.
3.10     It had been hoped that the larger share to the producers would have
been financed through the reduction      in Cocobod operating costs    from an
estimated 22% of the f.o.b. export price in 1987/88 to about 15% in 1988/89,
which would not have involved the sacrifice of the share going to the
Government.   Indeed, significant effort has been directed at improving the
efficiency of the Cocobod. The work force has been reduced from 79,000 in 1984
to 46,000 in 1991, and effectively to 43,000 due to vacancies; input subsidies
valued at about 9,000 cedi per ton of cocoa produced have been eliminated;
corporate planning has been introduced; and there has been some rationalization
of functions, especially in haulage of cocoa through increased reliance on the
railway and on the private sector.
3.11     However, in spite of these cost reduction efforts, Cocobod costs in
1990 have been estimated at 28% of the f.o.b. value of exports. This reflects



the impact of the dramatic fall in price on the international market and the
fact that costs are determined independently of the price. In the absence of
the dramatic decline in price the cost ratio would have been nearer the target.
However, some aspects of program performance militated against achievement of
the 15% target. The divestiture of plantations has been slower than expected
-- only 7 of the 52 targeted for divestiture were sold by 1990; and there has
been no significant progress in restructuring the cocoa processing company.
Similarly, the pace of retrenchment of the labor force has been slowed, as the
financial burden of the severance payments is particularly onerous given the
depressed state of international cocoa prices.
The Stimulation of Private Investment
3.12     Of the three sets of actions to stimulate private investment --
rehabilitation of infrastructure, improvement in the attractiveness of the
policy environment, and setting up joint ventures of selected state-owned
enterprises -- substantial progress was made in the case of the first two. The
outstanding example of infrastructure rehabilitation was the improvement of the
port at Takoradi.
3.13     Efforts to improve the policy environment included:
* the updating of the Investment Code in 1990 to include benefits to
existing enterprises;
*  the setting up in July 1990 of export financing facilities for non-
traditional commodities;
* the lowering of the rate of the Corporate Tax applicable to
agriculture, manufacturing, real estate, construction and services
to 35% in the 1991 Budget after having been lowered in the previous
budget from 55% to 50%, except for construction which had been
already at 50% and was lowered to 45%;
* the reduction in the rate of import duty on semi-processed
intermediate goods to 10% from 15% in 1991;
* the raising in 1991 of corporate tax rebates on exports from a
range  of 30-40%   to 60-75%   for agriculture   depending  on the
proportion exported, and for manufacturing from 25% to 30%.
3.14     These efforts were only some of the many through which the Government
of Ghana sought to address the constraints on investment residing in the
uncertainty about the economy, and in concerns about taxation, the restrictive
and cumbersome regulatory framework, and access to credit and financing. The
concern over access to credit and financing was addressed through a financial
sector adj'ustment program (see below). In 1991, when it became clear that the
weak link in the adjustment program was the inadequate response of private
domestic investment, emphasis shifted to the re-examination of the legal,
regulatory, and consultative framework in order to make it consistent with
economic liberalization and the creation of a dynamic private sector.      This
reorientation is supported by an IDA credit for SDR 84.6 million (US$120
million equivalent) which was approved by the Board in April 1991.



-7-
3.1-5    Running counter to the positive measures that were taken is the
perception in part of the business community that there has been a continuation
of some anti-private sector biases in some parts of the Government, reflected
in vigorous pursuit of businessmen for alleged economic crimes, overzealous tax
enforcement, and occasional direct intervention in private operations. These
biases were also reflected in slow processing of applications for registration
of new businesses, and the failure on the part of civil servants to show
willingness to clarify for new entrepreneurs the legal and administrative
requirements for doing business in Ghana. The predominance of officials in the
arrangements for government/private sector consultations, and the slowness in
setting up the consultative apparatus were also mentioned as negative factors
in the new economic environment.
Domestic Resource Mobilization
3.16     Saving and investment goals were pursued through policies to increase
domestic resource mobilization. These policies were to a) restore confidence
in the financial system, and b) increase public sector resource mobilization.
Accordingly, the Government of Ghana implemented during 1989-1990 a program,
supported by an IDA Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (FINSAC), to improve the
regulatory framework and provide better supervision of banks; to restructure
financially distressed banks; and to improve mobilization of savings and the
allocation of credit. In August 1989 the Banking Law was amended by the PNDC
to set capital adequacy and reserve requirements, stipulate loan limits and
formalize reporting requirements. In February 1990 the Non-Performing Ass-ets
Recovery Trust was set up to receive the non-performing assets of banks in
exchange for special GOG bonds. Simultaneously, bank supervision capability
of the Bank of Ghana was strengthened. Subsequently, a Stock Exchange and a
Credit Clearing House were established. Although the evaluation of the FINSAC
is outside the scope of this inquiry, it is fitting to point out that in
response to these policies banks have begun to implement restructuring plans,
have reduced operating cost and have improved their efficiency.
3.17     In order to improve the Central Government's contribution to domestic
resource mobilization, the Government has made a fundamental change in its tax
policy and has reduced the deficit in the recurrent budget.    There has been a
definite movement away from taxes on production toward taxes on consumption,
hence reducing the taxation of savings.       Sales taxes have doubled their
contribution to revenue since 1986. At the same time there has been an attempt
to widen the revenue base while trying to reduce the importance of taxes on
cocoa exports. Taxation of petroleum has gained in importance, its contribu-
tion rising from under 5% of revenue and grants in 1987 to nearly 22% estimated
in the 1991 budget. In order to improve the efficiency of tax administration
and reduce the costs of collection the National Revenue Secretariat has been
strengthened and re-integrated into the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning.   The overall effect of these changes has been that revenue has
averaged 12% of GDP during the 1987-90 period compared with 8% during the
preceding four year period. At the same time the deficit in the current budget
has been eliminated, with the result that the Government has been able to avoid
borrowing(net) from the private sector and has been repaying its debt to the
monetary system.

been achieved, except for the maximum lending rate in 1989, mainly because of
the resurgence of high inflation and the slow take-off of the demand for credit
and financing by private investors.
ManaRement of Public Sector Resources
3.19     The structural adjustment program focussed on three areas: a) public
expenditure management, b) civil service reform, and c) state-owned enter-
prises. The two areas of expenditure management targeted for attention were
the Public Investment Program and the Annual Expenditure Budget.
Public Expenditure Management
3.20     The GOG has made significant progress in developing its capacity to
prepare a detailed Public Investment Program(PIP) and in substantially
integrating the current year's program with the annual budget. There is a 15%
internal rate of return threshold for inclusion of any project, and an i.r.r.
calculation is required for all projects costing over US$5 million. For social
sector projects there may be no i.r.r. but projects must be cost effective.
The composition of the PIP is determined in accordance with guidelines set out
under the ERP, which require that more than 50Z be allocated to infrastructure.
Typically, the allocation has been 62% infrastructure, 22% productive sectors,
and the remainder to the social sectors.
3.21     The original objective was to automate the putting together of the
budget by 1989. A small Budget Task Force was set up, trained, and provided
with computers and technical assistance to do the initial study. Today there
is a core group of 16 trained officers plus support staff, all dedicated to
budget preparation. Compared with the situation four years ago when the budget
statement was not available until five months into the budget year and details
some months later, the basic budget statement covering recurrent and capital,
and including subvented organizations is now ready in January -- the first
month of the financial year. Printed, detailed versions are generally ready
by April, although by March most ministries have received advance copies. The
process now fully conforms with the guidelines on personnel emoluments, the
wage bill falling from 5.1% of GDP in 1986 to 4.3% in 1990, and its share of
total expenditure falling from 27% to 24%.
Civil Service Reform
3.22     Civil service reform involved the retrenchment of surplus staff, the
recruitment of needed high level skills, and pay reform. Compared with a target
of 15,000 per year to be released from the civil and the education services
over a three year period 1987-90, actual retrenchment was just over 12,000 per
vear over a four year period, and the program has been extended through 1992.
The net reduction in the service was somewhat smaller because inadequately
controlled recruitment initially eroded some of the gains from retrenchment.
Still, there has been a cumulative net employment reduction of 3% annually.
The achievements of the skills mobilization scheme were modest and mixed. The
scheme provided for the recruitment of local consultants, long term recruitment
of Ghanaians from the private sector, inducement of Ghanaians abroad to return,
and the payment of special duty allowances to serving Ghanaians to do special



-9-
tasks. Attraction of Ghanaians from overseas was particularly unsuccessful
since some mechanisms were not used for fear of provoking resentment within the
service.   The GOG has decided to explore the alternative of a fast track
development program for promising young officers. Pay reform objectives have
been partially achieved -- real pay has increased by 8.7% between 1986 and
1990, and the pay scale has been decompressed so that the ratio of highest to
lowest pay scales has gone from 5.4 to 1 in 1988 to 9.5 to 1 in 1990.!i
State-Owned Enterprise Reform
3.23     The main objectives of the state-owned enterprises reform were to
reduce the size of the sector through divestiture and to improve the efficiency
of priority enterprises remaining in the public sector through restructuring,
performance monitoring and evaluation (PME).     As of January 1991, 15 small
enterprises with a total value of 2 billion cedis had been sold to the private
sector, and 23 had been liquidated.    Seventeen SOEs were identified as core
enterprises to remain in the public sector and to be included under the PME
system. While in 1988 fifteen (15) of the core enterprises had a net loss
before tax of Cedi 417 million, they realized a net profit of Cedi 19 million
in 1989 and Cedi 26.9 million in 1990.     Under the PME system the SOEs are
required to provide quarterly and annual performance reports to the State
Enterprises Commission but most have been unable to meet this requirement in
a timely manner due to weak internal management information systems, especially
up-to-date audited accounts.
3.24      As of the end of 1990 there were 97 SOEs in the SEC data base, not
including the core group to remain in the public sector, employing a total of
92,350. Of these SOEs, 60 were profitable and generated profits of the order
of Cedi 15 billion in 1989, while 33 loss makers recorded a total operating
loss of Cedi 12.5 billion. It has been estimated that the 114 SOEs in the SEC
data base represents about one-half of the total number of SOEs and about two-
thirds of employment in the SOE sector. When account is taken of the size of
the SOE sector, it becomes apparent that the pace of divestiture has been slow.
The GOG continues to face a financial burden reflected in a net current flow
of subsidies and subventions of the order of Cedi 2 billion per year to the
SOEs and in loan guarantees amounting to about Cedi 25 billion.
External Support
3.25     External assistance officially committed to Ghana by bilateral and
multilateral sources (not including the IMF) rose from US$437 million in 1986
to US$749 million in 1987 and was nearly US$850 million during the next two
years. Net disbursement were US$372 million in 1986, remained at that level
in 1987, but increased strongly in the next two years to reach US$553 million
in 1989. The average official commitments during 1987-89 amounted to US$815
million compared with US$418 million during 1984-86. The corresponding figures
for bilateral sources only were US$411 million and US$146 million. While not
all of the increase in bilateral assistance was support for the SAP a

substantial portion was; the cofinancing for the SAC credits mentioned above
is indicative. 3/
3.26     The above review of some of the main structural adjustment actions and
achievements indicate the broad range and depth of changes in policy and
administration attempted by the GOG under the SAP. In the following section
an attempt will be made to gauge, albeit roughly, the impact of this effort and
of the associated stabilization program on the economy.
IV. RECENT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
4.01     GDP grew at an average rate of slightly more than 5% per annum -- the
SAC target -- during 1986-89, and at 3.3% in 1990 due mainly to drought. With
population growing at 2.6%, growth in real GDP per capita was positive
throughout the period.     Underlying this growth in GDP was a significant
resurgence in cocoa production of 26.7% between 1986 and 1990 notwithstanding
the decline in the    export price of cocoa.   Mining grew at 10% per year in
response to renewed investments in gold; manufacturing continued to recover
although the impetus was provided by fuller capacity utilization and this was
being exhausted; utilities grew at about 10% and so did the private part of the
services sector.   Agriculture (not including cocoa) was the weak performer
among sectors, with average GDP growth of just over 1% per annum during
1986-90.
4.02     Investment improved during 1986-90, with the Investment/GDP ratio
rising from 9.7% to 16%. While this means that the revised target of 16% set
under SAC II has been achieved, the growth of investment is still short of that
necessary to meet long term GDP growth aspirations.       Although the private
sector's contribution to the recovery of investment was significant, having
increased from 2.1% of GDP to over 8% according to preliminary estimates, this
was concentrated in mining and real estate and hence not indicative of a broad-
based resurgence consistent with the intended shift from a public sector
dominated to a private sector led economy. This has been recognized by the GOG
and, with IDA support, a program to address the specific requirements for a
more vigorous private response was put in place in 1991.
4.03     National savings increased during 1986-90 from 5.1% to 8.2% of GDP,
reflecting the sharp rise in private saving from 3.4% of GDP in 1986 to 6.5%
in 1990. Given that per capita income was increasing at about 2%, the implied
marginal savings rate of over 30% is remarkable. This growth fell just short
of the revised target set for SAC II and substantially short of the more
optimistic target of over 14% set under SAC I.           Clearly,  even if the
significant capital inflows from overseas required to sustain the level of
investment consistent with growth targets do in fact materialize, a substan-
tially greater fraction of incremental per capita income will have to be saved
in future. This would seem to require that the rate of inflation fall and that
interest rates become positive.
3/ OECD:   "Geographical Distribution of Financial Flows to Developing
Countries", Paris, 1991.



4.04     While CDP per capita rose at approximately 2% per year over the
program period, private consumption per capita rose more slowly due to the
increase in the rate of saving. This explains the public perception in Ghana
that the adjustment program has brought less prosperity than the 5% per annum
GDP growth rate would imply.
4.05     Exports of goods and non-factor services grew at an average rate of
over 8% annually during 1986-90, but the expected current account surplus of
US$110 million per year was not realized due to deterioration in the terms of
trade, and especially the steep fall in the international price of cocoa.4
These facts notwithstanding, Ghana was able to increase its gross international
reserves from US$149 million at the end of 1986 to US$269 million at the end
of 1990 and to reduce almost to the point of elimination the arrears on current
payments. Repatriation of Ghanaian savings from overseas, estimated at over
US$200 million annually over the last two years, contributed significantly to
the recent improvement in the capital account.
4.06     As of the end of 1990 inflation had not been brought under control,
the GDP deflator increasing at 34% in that year, approximately the average
annual rate of increase over the previous four years. The Consumer Price Index
showed that up to 1989 inflation had been abating, albeit slowly, but that
there was a resurgence in 1990. This resurgence has been attributed to higher
food prices due to poor crops resulting from drought and to a steep rise in the
prices of petroleum products due to a sharp increase in world crude oil prices
as well as heavier excise taxes on the main petroleum products. There was a
significant reduction in inflation during 1991 partly in response to monetary
policy aimed at reducing the excess liquidity that in 1990 had validated cost-
push pressures.
Overview
4.07     Aside from the performance indicators mentioned above, there are
others indicative of the success of stabilization efforts. The fiscal balance
improved, the broad fiscal deficit"' having been reduced from 3.3% of GDP in
1986 to 2.4% in 1990.  External debt service6/ as a percent of export of goods
and services was reduced from 47.8 in 1986 to 37.9 in 1990.        The rate of
increase in the supply of broad money fell from 53.7% in 1986 to 18.0% in 1990.
Meanwhile, the overvaluation of the exchange rate was corrected, the spread
between the parallel market and the official rate fell from 87% in 1986 to 3%
at mid 1991, and, for all practical purposes the cedi became a convertible
currency.
4/ Cocoa prices realized for Ghanaian exports fell by 46% between 1986
and 1990.

- 12 -
4.08     The question arises as to what extent the economic response noted
above was a byproduct of the substantial assistance received by Ghana after
1986.1' It is difficult to separate the effect of aid on growth from that of
policy changes.    However,  it can be noted that a comparative study of
adjustment programs in seven African countries,-' showed that the aid per
capita disbursed in 1987 to Ghana was slightly lower than the average for
Guinea, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi and Togo, and substantially lower than for
Senegal, but that most of these countries did not match Ghana's growth
performance.   Thus it would seem that while aid flows most likely assisted,
this factor alone would not explain the growth rates achieved by Ghana.
4.09     While it can be stated with confidence that the performance of the
economy outlined above broadly reflects the impact of the economic recovery
program, it is less clear how much is attributable to the effects of the
structural adjustment emphasis after 1985.      The likely existence of lags
between implementation of policy change and the appearance of the effects on
economic performance indicators suggests that the drawing of detailed
conclusions regarding the effects of particular parts of the Ghanaian economic
program should be approached with caution.
V. EVALUATION
5.01     The structural adjustment effort in Ghana has been successful in that
the Government of Ghana has implemented a wide range of measures promptly and
wholeheartedly, thereby achieving a substantial reorientation of the policy
environment in a direction favoring greater efficiency in the use of resources
within the public sector and an enhanced role for the private sector in the
economy. The macroeconomic indicators suggest that the economy continues its
recovery from the negative growth, high inflation, and foreign exchange crisis
of the early 1980s. However, the adjustment is an on-going process and further
measures are being introduced. So far, the private sector investment response
has been slower than anticipated, and is now the subject of special attention.
5.02     The review of SACs I & II can serve to identify the strengths and
weaknesses of the structural adjustment process and the Bank/IDA's role in it.
The review is approached first from the point of view of program/project cycle
issues. This is followed by a review of a sample of components to see what
factors may have resulted in the differences in performance.
Program/Project Cycle Issues
Design
5.03     Several aspects of the design of SACs I & II stand out as having been
important in determining the generally positive outcome.

Saharan Africa" dated October 15, 1990.

* The structural adjustment program (SAP) and the supporting SAC I
was timed to continue the natural progression of response to an
economic crisis from the provision of emergency imports, rehabili-
tation of the export sectors and the requisite infrastructure, and
the stimulation of recovery in the productive sectors to a
comprehensive    overhaul of the policy     framework to serve a
reoriented economic strategy. This timing took advantage of the
possibility for policy dialogue in a context of mutual confidence
built up during the post 1983 crisis, and of the recognition by GOG
that more profound changes in the policy environment were needed
to continue the recovery.
* There were extensive consultations:
a) within the Bank -- between Country Operations and Projects,
Technical Divisions;
b) Bank/Fund -- several meetings to discuss coor-
dination of    support for Ghana's ERP, and a
common PFP;
c) Bank/GOG -- brainstorming sessions in July/August 1986
served to identify the major adjustment issues     and    to
agree approaches to them;
d) GOG/Private Sector -- brainstorming sessions also included
the private sector, trade unions, and the press;
e) Bank/Donors -- meetings between the Resident Mission and
donors to discuss SAP details, and the inclusion of staff of
one donor in the appraisal mission.
* The SACs were an integral part of a lending program unified by the
objective of supporting Ghana's ERP.    ISAC, SAIS, FINSAC, EMS,91
although addressing particular aspects of adjustment, shared the
common objective of adjusting the policy environment and institu-
tions in the same direction as the SACs.      This situation lent
itself to the use of mutually reinforcing cross-conditionality
which would have increased Bank leverage had this been necessary.
* SAC I called for a wide variety of policy measures and institu-
tional changes to be accomplished within an optimistic time frame,
especially given the capacity constraints imposed by the scarcity
of skilled and experienced officials in the public service, and by
the available information base. SAC II was designed around more
modest targets.

* Considerable economic and sector work and project financed studies
were undertaken jointly with the GOG during 1985 and 1986. This
work included comprehensive reviews of public expenditures, and of
the agricultural and industrial sectors. Attempts to study cocoa
marketing and state-owned enterprises were not fruitful.      Many
components of the structural adjustment program were designed on
the basis of this recent economic and sector work.        This was
especially true of the tax reform component which benefitted from
a Trade Taxation and Tariff Review (1986), a Study of the Sales Tax
Credit System, a Study of the Taxation of Investment, and a Study
of Income Taxation (1989).
5.04     The approach to the design of the SACs fostered an unambiguous sense
of ownership of the program by the Government of Ghana and a high level of
commitment to its implementation. The existence of recent studies were helpful
in providing convincing evidence of the need for action and of the potential
efficacy of certain measures. In some cases where such preparatory work had
not been done, the Bank failed to convince the GOG of the merit of particular
courses of action, eg. in cocoa marketing reform and reform of state-owned
enterprises. The result was that the GOG was not fully committed initially to
these components. In any event, the absence of adequate information meant that
even if there had been total commitment, some necessary decisions could not
have been taken.
5.05     At the same time some aspects which negatively affected performance
of the SAP point to some areas of weakness in the approach to design of the
package. Primary focus necessarily had to be on the measures to be implemented
in order to change outcomes by changing procedures and/or institutions. But
this focus should not preclude attention to side effects, for these can impede
the success of the program. Some categories of side effects were not given
adequate attention in the design of the structural adjustment process:
a) financial -- specifically the cost of severance benefits associated
with the massive retrenchment in the SOEs. This is said to have
slowed retrenchment in the Cocobod and the divestiture of SOEs.
This was partly addressed under SAL II by allowing retrenchment
costs in'SOEs to be covered by grants from the budget of GOG, but
it is not clear that firm targets were set and the fiscal implica-
tions fully analyzed. Lack of up-to-date financial information on
most SOEs was also a factor in the absence of clear estimates of
retrenchment costs;
b) institutional -- little thought was given to revising the roles of
institutions made obsolete by the liberalization of the regulatory
framework.   In the absence of ready programs defining their new
roles, institutions such as the Ministry of Trade and the Prices
and Incomes Commission tend to search for new functions to justify
their staffing and indeed their survival.    This could result in
overlapping with other parts of Government and to continued
inefficiency of public sector resource use;
c) unemployment/underemployment -- the commitment of the political
directorate in charge of the economy to a process of structural



- 15 -
adjustment will depend on the extent to which the program is
sensitive to and addresses an existing or potential unemploy-
ment/underemployment problem. It seems to have been assumed that
the expansion of the economy would occur promptly and new jobs
would be created, and/or the unemployed would be absorbed in the
informal sector.   In the case of Ghana, which had just absorbed
about a million returnees from Nigeria, these assumptions should
have been carefully examined. Several reports suggest that the GOG
perceived the existence of and was concerned about an unemploy-
ment/underemployment problem especially among youth in urban
areas.- 10
d) temporary adjustment problems -- trade liberalization, the
centerpiece of Ghana's SAP, to push industries to become more
competitive internationally and to develop export potential,
involved the reduction of effective protection by the removal of
non-tariff barriers and the reduction of tariffs. Some productive
activities cannot survive in the atmosphere of international
competition, but others can if given time and assistance to adjust.
Attempts to address the interim adjustment problems of the latter
reflected in phased reduction of protection and the provision of
special financing and technical assistance facilities are sometimes
used in SAL operations, but were not initially considered in the
Ghana case. Advance planning for the interim problems can help to
reduce the burden of adjustment by minimizing the loss of salvage-
able activities. This is particularly important where productive
activity is dominated by the SOE sector and the financial burden
of adjustment will be concentrated in the government budget.
Appraisal
5.06     The appraisal of SAL I did not follow the usual pattern in which
discussions and agreements are reached at the technical level and then
presented to the political directorate for their approval.       This approach
frequently puts the Ministry of Finance in the position of having to convince
the rest of the government of the merit of a package it had negotiated. The
Ghanaian leadership reversed this process by introducing at the beginning of
the appraisal a week-long brainstorming process involving members of the PNDC,
ministers and senior civil servants, trade unions including the civil service
employees   association,  employers   associations,   representatives   of  the
t See Report entitled - "Enhancing the Human Impact of the Adjustment
Program" - prepared by the Government of Ghana for the Sixth Meeting
of the Consultative Group for Ghana, Paris, May 14-15, 1991.

committees for the defense of the revolution, and bank staff.     This session
succeeding in developing a broad consensus on the main elements of the reform
program. Once consensus was reached at this level, the outstanding technical
issues were resolved in a retreat attended by a sub-group of the cabinet,
senior officials and technocrats, and officials of the Bank, Fund and one
donor.
5.07     This sequencing of events in the appraisal process did not find favor
among some officials, including some in the Ministry of Finance who felt the
ministry was losing control of subjects traditionally under its control. Some
officials elsewhere in the public sector were of the view that the political
directorate was being led to agree on technical issues before of-
ficials/technocrats had had an opportunity to study the issues and provide
their advice. Where studies which had been acceptable to the officials formed
the basis for Bank recommendations, the sequencing was not problematic. But
where there was not an accepted diagnosis and analysis of options based on
adequate information, Bank proposals were regarded as deriving from Bank dogma
rather than from technical expertise.    Some issues which were agreed at the
political level, e.g. the recruitment of Ghanaians from overseas on special
terms, understandably provoked dissatisfaction among civil servants with
adverse effect on implementation results.
5.08     The appraisal of SAC II did not follow in the manner outlined above
for SAC I. Instead, the Ministry of Finance & Planning was left to play the
lead role. Since the commitment of the political directorate to structural
adjustment had already been demonstrated, and given that no change in policy
direction was involved, the issues to be resolved were essentially second order
technical details. However, some Bank staff are of the view that there may
have been less attention to consensus building under SAC II and that little
would have been lost and probably something would have been gained by
explaining further the Governments intentions.
5.09     The experience suggests that the momentum of implementation can
benefit from a consensus at political level at the outset. While this cannot
ensure success if there is disagreement at the technical level, it can ensure
that at least there are no obstacles to the adjustments requiring mainly
decision at political level.
Implementation
5.10     The arrangements for implementation of SAC I involved the setting up
of a Structural Adjustment Program Secretariat (SAPSEC) reporting to the
Chairman of PNDC Secretaries who is equivalent to the Prime Minister. About
ten special units and task forces were set up to implement various aspects.
SAPSEC had the responsibility for coordinating the work of and providing
logistical support to these units and task forces,       and for seeing that
appropriate documentation was prepared and submitted to the PNDC for necessary
decisions to be taken in keeping with the adjustment timetable.           These
arrangements were consistent with the priority of structural adjustment and the
GOG's commitment to it, and with the need to alter the day to day administra-
tion to serve the new priority. They permitted constant monitoring of actions
to satisfy conditionalities and facilitated the preparation of the necessary
information base for decision-making by the PNDC.



- 17 -
5.11     Under SAC II the SAPSEC functions were transferred to the MFEP, which
then became the focus for coordination of the SAP. This seems to have been a
necessary first step in the transition from dramatic change in the policy
directions and environment toward the absorption of the change in the regular
administration of government.   While on cursory glance it may seem that the
pace of adjustment has been slower under the new arrangements, this may in fact
reflect the passing to a more difficult phase involving fewer changes in rules
but more institutional developments including the selection and training of
personnel in new and more sophisticated skills.
5.12     The arrangements for SAC I were short-term responses to Ghana's weak
institutional capacity, which permitted the SAP to get underway and achieve
significant success but at the expense of the regular work of public adminis-
tration. Many Bank staff concede that SAC I very probably over-burdened the
limited implementation capacity of the Ghanaian public sector, with the result
that some aspects did not go well.   Now that the program is well underway the
GOG is moving away from the special units/task forces concept partly because
the emergency approaches disrupted regular procedures and created uncertainty
among regular civil servants regarding their roles and functions, partly
because of the discontent associated with the system of special allowances that
were paid to participants in these units, and partly because when these units
come to an end institutional memory is lost. In retrospect it seems that from
a sustainability point of view it might have been better to have used existing
institutions, appropriately strengthened, to carry out adjustment policies
falling within their area of responsibility than to have set up temporary
alternative structures. While the initial pace of adjustment would have been
slower, the loss of momentum at a later stage associated with the assimilation
of special units into the regular structure might have been avoided.
Supervision
5.13     Ghanaian officials speak highly of the usefulness of Bank supervision
in facilitating the work on the PIP, Tax Reform, Budget Reform and Public
Expenditure Reviews. Special reference has been made to the flexibility of the
Bank in responding to emerging and unforseen problems and to the willingness
to help in devising innovative solutions.     This detailed follow-up is also
apparent from the trail of reports and background documents related to SAP
implementation. However, this work, which appears to be of consistently high
quality, was not without a price as the staff time devoted to SACs I & II
exceeded the norms for adjustment lending in the Africa Region.

5.14        Judging from the results achieved as well from the volume and
quality of the work, the extra time devoted to the program seems to have been
money well spent. The norms may seem justifiable given the constraints on the
Bank's budget, but greater attention may need to be paid in SAL project
completion reports and audits to the issue of whether adequacy of investment
of staff time in supervision and to a lesser extent in preparation has been a
factor in performance. It may well be that successful adjustment operations
are more expensive in terms of staff time than has been assumed.
Specific Components
5.15        The PCR specifically addresses the question of why some components
of the program were more successful than others.       It identifies the main
factors responsible to be a) degree of commitment by the GOG to particular
component, b) the capabilities of the implementing agencies, and c) parallel
credits under which structural adjustment of some sectors was sought. While
agreeing that these were important factors, this evaluation would suggest that
a more detailed look at some components supports the view that inadequate
preparatory work explains in part the failure of the Bank to convince the GOG
of the appropriateness of some prescriptions, which resulted in the lower level
of commitment to some components of the program. It also explains why even
though the GOG agreed to the inclusion of these components, progress was
thwarted by the inadequacy of information for decision-making.
SOE Reform
5.16        Bank experience in the reform of SOE sectors was limited.      This
lack of experience should have been compensated for by a careful study of the
sector to develop a suitable information base for analysis of the options and
the likely effects of various types of intervention.      The Bank pushed for
divestiture of enterprises, but in the absence of up-to-date information on the
assets and liabilities, it was impossible to interest potential buyers and to
enter into serious negotiations. There was little understanding of the role
of sector ministries under whose control many enterprises fall, and hence there
was no strategy for dealing with the natural response of those who felt that
their power and influence was being threatened. The institutional arrangements
for divestiture received little thought, with the result that this was
initially assigned to the very agency whose reason for being was the monitoring
of the SOE sector. Given that the ultimate concern was the efficiency of the
sector, more thought should have been given to the possibility that many
factories  could not be privatized and should be closed.         All of these
considerations make it easy to understand that the speed with which the Bank
hoped that the privatization objective would have been achieved was not
realistic, and why there was failure to convince the client that the Bank
really knew how best to pursue the efficiency of the sector.
5.17        Ghana has achieved reasonable progress      by focussing   less on
privatization and by pursuing a wider set of options. It has sought to improve
efficiency of those enterprises that will remain in the public sector; and has
identified some to be closed, some to be sold, and some to be held as joint
ventures with the private sector. The necessary financial information about
the enterprises is being developed.      Divestiture has been assigned to a
Divestiture Implementation Committee, which is being provided a staff with the



- 19 -
necessary skills to prepare a prospectus and to negotiate with potential
buyers. Recent successes have come about partly in response to the improved
policy environment and political atmosphere, which can be seen as increasingly
favorable to private entrepreneurs.    It is doubtful that divestiture can be
successful before this stage is reached.
5.18        The emphasis on divestiture, while appropriate at the time of SAC
II when the emerging strategy was beginning to give higher priority to the
private sector, was premature under SAC I. The reform of the policy environ-
ment to favor private activity had not yet started, and the financial sector
adjustments still lay in the future. Bank work on SOEs was inadequate to win
respect for Bank expertise and to foster a sense of commitment by the GOG to
make changes in this area.    Bank insistence on divestiture was seen by some
Ghanaian officials as motivated by dogmatic rather than pragmatic consider-
ations. Some Bank staff concede that the timing and timetable were unrealis-
tic, and that improvements in the private sector policy environment including
financial sector reform should have been well underway before divestiture.
5.19        SOE reform was re-visited under SAC II.       Although the general
objectives identified in the President's Report were said to have remained
unchanged (ostensibly from SAC I) there was a shift in emphasis from dives-
titure toward the broader aims preferred by the GOG. This had the effect of
defining a role for the SEC which did not require its eventual dissolution.
It is also evident that the Bank had been learning from experience and had
become sensitive to the need to address such issues as the financing of
retrenchment costs.   Targets for divestiture of enterprises were adjusted to
be more realistic, and greater attention paid to the institutional requirements
for managing the reform process.
Cocoa
5.20        The price incentives to cocoa growers have been increased and cocoa
growers have increased plantings and improved their fields with the result that
output and exports have recovered strongly, and there have been some reforms
tending to lower Cocobod costs. Yet, the achievements of this component did
not live up to expectations within the Bank and possibly in Ghana.          The
producer price has not reached the target share of 55% of the export price; and
"Resources used to increase the producer price during 1989-91 have, for the
most part, been at the expense of Government revenue, instead of from cost
savings, the opposite of the trend in 1984-88".)1' While this has been partly
the result of the substantial decline in international cocoa price, and some
reforms are being pursued under the Cocoa Rehabilitation Project (Cr. 1854) of
FY-91, these do not fully explain performance of this component under the SACs.
5.21        At the time SAC I was being designed the Bank did not know enough
about the complexities of cocoa marketing to enable it to recommend a strategy
for reform in this area. Under the Export Rehabilitation Technical Assistance
Project approved by IDA in December 1983, high marketing costs and institu-
tional weaknesses of the Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board (GCMB) were included among
I'  Africa Region: Ghana - Progress on Adjustment; Report No. 9475-GH,
April 16, 1991: page (iii), para. 8.



- 20 -
the factors responsible for the decline in cocoa exports.     The reduction of
GCMB operating costs was said to require divestment of inefficient plantations,
divestment of cocoa processing factories, reduction in over-staffing, greater
reliance on private haulage services, and the introduction of corporate
planning and a management information system. Many of these requirements were
to have been studied; and a study of alternative systems of marketing was to
have been completed by June 1985.      Studies led to the divestiture of the
majority of plantations and to a joint venture ownership of the insecticide
plant. The GCMB rejected the recommendations of the study of cocoa processing
factories and of the study on corporate planning; and, although there was a
seminar on the subject, the marketing study was never done. The Board staff
felt that the study was unlikely to be useful since there were not many
alternative marketing cases to be studied, and the Ghana case was one of the
most sophisticated as a result of long experience.
5.22        At the design stage of SAC I the Bank and the Cocobod did not agree
on cocoa marketing and there were no study results around which discussions
could revolve. There was disagreement over producer prices; the Cocobod did
not agree that the producer price target should be a ratio of the f.o.b. export
price and thought more account should be taken of marketing costs. The fact
that agreement was reached at a higher level on adjustments in the cocoa sector
before these differences at the technical level were resolved did not auger
well for the implementation phase.       Failure of the Bank to foresee the
magnitude of the financial costs of retrenchment and to address the gaps which
would be created by reducing the extension service functions of the Cocobod
provided additional points of friction which slowed implementation.
5.23        In this situation, once the Bank had reached agreement in principle
at higher levels of Government, the technical content of the adjustment package
should have been the subject of greater follow-up with the Cocobod than
apparently took place. The issue of Cocobod reform was not considered in the
President's Report proposing SAC II in February 1989, which seems to indicate
that by then it had been decided in the Bank to approach this matter in an
operation specific to cocoa rather than as part of a multi-component structural
adjustment package.   However, the Cocoa Rehabilitation Project supported by
Cr.-1854 and approved in FY-88, which should have complemented cocoa price
policies by promoting improvements in areas such as domestic marketing, was
slow to start. At December 31, 1990 the total credit remained undisbursed.
Tax Policy and Administration
5.24        The experience with this component stands in contrast with that
with cocoa and SOE reforms. There is general agreement that objectives were
met and that the component was very successful. Ghanaian performance on the
tax side always exceeded that required by conditionality, both as regards
collection and policy changes.    Among the many factors which seem to have
contributed to this outcome, the following are important:
a)    commitment by the GOG was exceptionally high.        The component
addressed a felt need about which it was not necessary to convince
the political directorate or officials;



- 21 -
b)    studies provided the basis for a high level of agreement at the
technical level between GOG and the Bank/Fund on almost every
aspect of the reform, and especially the timing of the work on
various types of taxation;
c)    dynamic   leadership  of  the  National  Revenue  Secretariat   was
reflected in a highly motivated and enthusiastic staff;
d)    the Ghanaian tax system was basically good even before the SAP but
suffered from shortage of personnel and inadequate documentation.
Thus the institutional problems were limited and amenable to fairly
rapid solution. At the same time the level of expertise of staff
was high, and this facilitated the dialogue with Bank staff;
e)    the Bank/Fund expertise in tax matters and relevance of their
experience was readily accepted by the NRS;
f)    in the course of supervision Bank staff provided significant hands-
on assistance timed to support the regular work of NRS; and
g)    the MFEP, being ultimately in charge of taxation, maintained a high
level of interest in the implementation of agreed changes; the NRS
was reintegrated with the MFEP.
The Effect of Adjustment on the Poor and Other Vulnerable Groups
5.25        The discussion of the effects of adjustment on the poor must start
by identifying the poor.    The Ghana Living Standards Survey referred to the
poorest 30% of households as "poor" and the poorest 10% as "extreme poor",
based on income per capita per year. Location and occupation of the "poor" and
"extreme poor" are important determinants of the impact of adjustment policies
on them. The survey found that just under two-thirds of the "poor" and the
"extreme poor" are rural, the remainder being urban and semi-urban.       Four-
fifths of the "poor" are farmers; while slightly more of the "extreme poor" are
farmers. An important difference between these two groups is that while over
a quarter of the "poor" are cocoa farmers, a much smaller proportion of the
"lextreme poor" are cocoa farmers. Although the "poor" are overwhelmingly self-
employed, over 8% are employed by the public sector. This discussion of the
effects of adjustment on the poor will focus on the "poor" lowest 30% of
households.   Where the differential impact on the "extreme poor" may be
important these are specifically mentioned.
5.26        Clearly, the impact on the poor deriving from the program and the
economic circumstances during the period of the SACs would have depended on
their location and on their occupation. In the absence of hard data one can
only theorize as to who were more vulnerable to particular factors, and because
of differences in direction of effects, weight in expenditure patterns, and
timing of some effects one can only make tentative judgements about the impact
on the group as a whole.
5.27        It seems likely that some of the urban poor were vulnerable to loss
of employment in the public sector, to increases in food prices resulting from
the increase in fertilizer prices associated with the removal of the subsidy,



- 22 -
to the increase in transportation cost due to petroleum price increases, and
to the increase in the cost of other non-food items associated with the
devaluation of the cedi. Survey data indicate that the poor account for 13%
of the expenditures on public transportation and 25% of spending on other fuels
(such as kerosene).121    At the same time,    they stood to benefit from a
resurgence in economic activity in the urban economy particularly in the
industrial and service sectors.
5.28        The rural poor were probably less vulnerable to the loss of public
sector employment than their urban counterparts. Some would have benefitted
from the increase in producer prices of cocoa, the extreme poor to a lesser
extent. As farmers, the increase in the cost of fertilizer input probably did
not affect the poor significantly since very probably they were not intensive
fertilizer users, and as food producers benefitted from higher prices. It is
very likely that they were adversely affected by the rise in non-food prices
associated with the devaluation of the cedi, though to a lesser extent than
their urban counterparts. Both urban and rural poor stood to benefit from the
improvements and change in targeting of health and education services, the
extent of benefit depending on the relative distribution of the services.
5.29        Because of the delay in the occurrence of offsetting benefits, the
urban poor were probably made worse off initially.        The rural poor were
probably better off initially to the extent that they were cocoa farmers. The
rural extreme poor being less integrated in the money economy, producing most
of their own food, and spending less on non-food items, were probably not
affected significantly in either direction. With the improved performance of
the economy and the abatement of inflation both urban and rural poor were most
likely made better off than before adjustment.
5.30        The Government, with support from the Bank, attempted to improve
the lot of the lower income groups by improving the delivery of social
services. Starting in 1983, it made a conscious effort to increase spending
for education, health and social services, with the result that the budget
share of these items increased gradually form 29.1% of total expenditures in
1983 to 41.7% in 1989, in spite of serious fiscal constraints.     At the same
time there was a shift within social services toward those programs most likely
to benefit the lower income groups, primary education and primary health care.
For example the share of primary education in the education budget increased
from 40% to 43% between 1987 and 1990.
5.31        The adjustment program had a more direct adverse effect on the
public sector employees who were dismissed as part of the retrenchment of about
50,000 civil and education service workers, 33,000 employees of the Cocobod,
and an unknown number made redundant by adjustment in the SOE sector. These
were not the hard core poor, but were for the most part lower level employees
with limited formal education or professional skills. The adverse impact of
job loss was mitigated to some extent by the fact that they were paid
separation allowances increasing with length of service to well over a year's
pay.   To further mitigate the burden of separation the GOG established a
12/ Africa Region: Ghana - ProRress on Adjustment; Report no. 9475-GH,
April 16, 1991.



- 23 -
"special efficiency budget" in 1987 to finance the costs of retraining, and
project loans were made available to assist the restoration of income sources
for redundant employees. Several thousand persons were provided training, and
many were provided seeds and other agricultural inputs to assist their
resettlement in the rural areas.
5.32        Consideration was given by the Bank to the inclusion of a component
in SAC I to address the adverse impact of the adjustment program on vulnerable
groups, but the idea was abandoned when the GOG began preparation of a more
elaborate program with similar objectives. The program, entitled "Programme
of Actions to Mitigate the Social Costs of Adjustment (PANSCAD)", was prepared
by the GOG in 1987 with assistance from a secretariat funded by the Bank. It
included 23 projects grouped into five categories -- employment generation,
community initiative projects, help to the redeployed, basic needs for
vulnerable groups, and education.    The Bank helped to organize a meeting of
donors in 1988, and US$85.0 million was pledged. IDA provided US$10 million
for the Priority Works Project (IDA Credit No. 1874-GH) as its contribution to
PAMSCAD.
5.33        In retrospect, PAMSCAD had a number of design weaknesses that have
resulted in slow implementation and limited effectiveness.      The GOG, in a
report presented to the May 1991 Consultative Group Meeting, outlined some of
these -- (i) PAMSCAD contains too many projects relative to donors' and the
GOG's capacity to implement; (ii) the program did not target the poorest
groups; (iii) there were too many donors for some projects; and (iv) the long
term elements of PAMSCAD should have been implemented as part of the GOG's
regular public investment program. Others have commented that complex multi-
sectoral and multi-donor programs of this type are inherently difficult to
administer.   Also, the GOG missed the opportunity to engage NGO's in the
community-based operations, where local level support of this kind can be very
effective. Nevertheless, PAMSCAD represents a serious attempt to provide help
to vulnerable groups, and was successful in securing substantial additional
donor support that might not otherwise have been forthcoming.
5.34        In summary, the impact of the adjustment program on the poorest
group appears to have been only moderately negative in the early stages and
positive over the longer term as the economy grew and real incomes increased,
and Government improved social services and targeted health and education more
toward the poor. Although with mixed results, PAMSCAD has served to mitigate
the negative impact of adjustment on vulnerable groups, even if these have not
been the poorest segment of the population.
Overall Evaluation
5.35        This quick overview of the program cycle and of a sample of
components including the very successful and the less than successful provides
the basis for some generalizations regarding the determinants of success of the
structural adjustment program in Ghana. The key seems to have been the degree
of commitment of the political directorate to macroeconomic policy adjustment
designed within the context of a close relationship between the GOG and the
Bank and Fund that had been nurtured during the first three years of Ghana's
ERP in the context of an increasingly close dialogue accompanied by substantial



- 24 -
financial support.   Thus where adjustment depended on political decisions,
these were taken promptly and adjustment proceeded rapidly.
5.36        The major successes were the correction of the overvaluation of the
exchange rate, the liberalization of trade, tax reform, the reduction of the
public sector deficit, and the improvement in producer price of cocoa and the
associated positive supply response. In all these areas studies, analyses and
data provided a basis for discussion and agreement as to the content and timing
of adjustment   measures.    Adjustment  involving  changes  in institutions,
improvement in skills and staffing, and the streamlining of procedures
invariably required greater attention to detail, and the success of components
involving such adjustment was very sensitive to the adequacy of the information
base and the degree of consultation at the technical level. Where this basis
did not exist, the degree of commitment at the political level was likely to
be less and the problems in implementation likely to be more if there had been
little prior consultation at that level.
5.37        The view of this evaluation is that the slower than expected
private sector response and the resurgence of inflationary pressures do not
constitute important failures of the structural adjustment program.        From
cursory observation it can be seen that most of the measures providing
incentives to the private sector were taken in 1989 and 1990, and that, even
if there were no further obstacles to investment, not enough time has elapsed
to allow the effects to be realized. Inflationary pressures were brought under
control in 1991. This said, it is useful, nevertheless, to see what lessons
may be learned from experience in these areas.
5.38        There is little experience in the Bank or in governments or in
universities and no widely agreed theoretical apparatus for guiding the
transformation of a public sector dominant and controlled economy into a market
oriented private enterprise driven one. The Bank's approach in support of such
transformation so far has been ad hoc rather than on the basis of a grand
design. While this seems to have been the manner in which Bank guidance of,
and support for, Ghanaian structural adjustment evolved, it is worthwhile
trying to understand why Ghana's private investment response has been slower
than expected, in order to see what lessons may be gained for other adjustment
programs.
5.39        From interviews with persons in the private sector it was clear
that the factors influencing investment response fell into three basic
categories -- those influencing willingness to invest, those determining
availability of resources, and the clarity of the legal and administrative
framework for private business.     The willingness to invest was adversely
affected by uncertainty regarding the permanence and the comprehensiveness of
changes in the policy environment and regarding "official" attitudes toward
private profit and the acquisition of wealth. It was also adversely affected
by uncertainty about the economy, which showed in a preference for trading
rather than for longer term investment       in productive   capacity.   These
preferences were reinforced by practices of the financial sector and by the
limitations in the range of financial institutions and services. Investment
response was also impeded by the uncertainty among entrepreneurs and officials
regarding legal requirements and administrative procedures for starting and
registering new enterprises.



- 25 -
5.40        Investment response is seen to depend on the simultaneous presence
of components to address all three categories of influences.      A sequential
approach to them is likely to lead to a delayed investment response. This view
is consistent with that expressed by some Bank staff that, given hindsight,
greater priority should have been given to financial sector adjustment. It is
also consistent with the view of some private sector spokesmen that removal of
procedural obstacles to investment and the clarification of the legal framework
should have been given higher priority, as even today this aspect is frus-
trating their efforts. At the same time, perfect foresight is impossible, and
one cannot hope to consider every factor at the design stage. The alternative
is to establish early in the design stage meaningful government/private sector
consultations in order to encourage in the private sector a feeling of
ownership of the program affecting them.
5.41        This relates to the actual private sector and the entrepreneurs in
it.   However, it should be observed that in Ghana the pool of potential
entrepreneurs has been limited by the fact that during over thirty years of
public sector dominance many would-be businessmen either joined the public
service or migrated. The full effect of the new framework will be spread over
many years as young people leaving schools and universities make their career
choices in an economic context that is no longer dominated by the public
sector.
5.42        The difficulty of bringing inflation under control indicates a need
to address specific supply-side influences rather than rely solely on demand
management in tackling the problem. In the Ghanaian case it seems that food
prices, by dint of the weight of food in the index, was a major factor in the
resurgence of inflationary pressures. Since there is reason to believe that
the impact of adjustment on the poor depends in large measure on what happens
to food prices, one is led to question the timing and to some extent the merit
of removal of fertilizer subsidies, a measure which seems to have been
justified by the simultaneous increase in cocoa producer prices but not
necessarily by price movements of domestic food crops. Between 1985 and 1990
the price of fertilizer increased tenfold, as the subsidy fell from about 63%
of the price to zero. The quantity of maize to purchase a kilo of fertilizer
increased from 360 to 900 grams between 1985 to 1988."'    The removal of the
subsidies would seem to have helped to push up prices of food and to reduce
producers margins.   Thus the poor among maize consumers and the poor among
maize producers bore part of the burden of subsidy removal.
5.43        Ghanaians applaud the high quality of Bank staff deployed to work
on the SACs. However, rapid turnover of Bank staff working on the structural
adjustment program has been mentioned as a factor which eroded the benefits of
continuity and experience to the adjustment process. By contrast the Ghanaian
team has remained essentially unchanged and has accumulated considerable
experience.   Over the five year period during which three SACs have been
introduced there have been three different country economic teams, with
continuity provided only by the fact that one senior economist and the resident
t Based on Ministry of Agriculture data.   The data also show that in
1984 the year of Ghana's famine 610 grams of maize were required
to buy 1 Kg. of fertilizer compared to 40 grams in 1983.



- 26 -
representative stayed in the division through most of this period. Clearly,
when the Bank embarks on a cycle of structural adjustment operations it should
plan to keep the same team in place for the duration of the cycle, if at all
possible.   The perception in the client country is that Bank staff use the
structural adjustment operation as a stepping stone to promotions, and move on
as soon as the credit is signed and implementation starts; leaving successors
who have to learn the country from scratch.     Yet, given that the Ghanaians
spoke highly of the quality of Bank staff deployed to work on the SACs, the
Bank must have made three successful transfers of responsibility which probably
helped to maintain the energy and momentum of the program.
5.44        These observations must not be interpreted as suggesting that with
more preparatory studies and consultation and without changes in staff a
perfect adjustment process could have been devised.     The issues were novel,
complex and overlapping; and there was pressure for action.L41 Thus the SAP
turned out to be a learning process for the international institutions as well
as for the GOG. It is also evident from this experience that the orientation
of the structural adjustment process changed over time from that of solving a
problem of debt/creditworthiness, foreign exchange shortage, and economic
instability to that of transforming the economy in order to achieve sustained
growth with equity.
VI. SUSTAINABILITY
6.01        The benefits from Ghana's structural adjustment program are likely
to be sustained. Widespread support for the reforms was one result of the open
consultative process by which the program was designed, and this support has
increased as a result of the resurgence of economic growth associated with the
program. The reforms have been so comprehensive and the Government commitment
so obviously beyond question that a reversal of policy directions is unthink-
able as long as this administration remains in control. Indeed, it is unlikely
that a new government could easily restore the regulatory and control
mechanisms that have been removed.
6.02        The level of quick disbursing aid for the SAP has been higher than
may be sustainable over the longer term. If the inflow of foreign financing
falls off before Ghana's export earnings increase sufficiently, there could be
a slowdown in GDP growth and pressure on the exchange rate generating cost of
living effects which may undermine the acceptability and popularity of the
program.   Should this coincide with the impending shift toward democracy,
41 Memo dated Sept.9, 1987 -Chief, AF4CO to Director, AF4 - Ghana -
First Impressions - BTO report. "Indeed I believe there is a danger
that we and they may be trying to do too much too fast, not because
the political fabric cannot stand it but because of administrative
capacity. If we and they spread ourselves too thinly over too many
initiatives, less may be accomplished than if we focussed more
narrowly.  We may, therefore, need to be more selective....On the
other hand, Ghana's leadership is impatient for results and there
is a counter danger... of losing momentum."



- 27 -
future governments may be more sensitive to program acceptability consider-
ations, and while they may not reverse the policy changes that have been made
they may be less willing to continue the economic liberalization process, such
as further privatization, and improvements in the investment climate.
6.03        Donors can do much to ensure the sustainability of the benefits by
not reducing quick disbursing aid too quickly, by careful planning of the shift
from program to project aid, and by taking into account the growth and
viability of Ghanaian export earnings in making their decisions.        To some
extent this will depend on the international prices for cocoa and gold, Ghana's
two most important exports. During this structural adjustment period the terms
of trade have turned against Ghana, mainly as a result of depressed interna-
tional prices for cocoa. Should this situation persist, future economic growth
can only be assured if alternative exports are developed and the dependence on
cocoa reduced, and this will take time. In the interim foreign capital inflows
either in the form of donor support or private foreign investment will be
essential to continue the momentum of the economy, which is necessary to
preserve the acceptability of the present strategy.
6.04        Sustainability of the efficiency gains and improvements in economic
management within the public sector will depend on how effectively Ghana makes
the transition from the use of special units and task forces to implement new
procedures to the use of permanent units that will regularly apply the
procedures. This transition requires the reorganization and strengthening of
the units that would ordinarily be responsible.    The need for this has been
recognized by the GOG, and supported by the Bank under its Economic Management
Support Project (Cr. No. 2224) which provided US$15.0 million in FY-91.
Effectiveness of this and future Bank support in this area will depend on the
recognition that the traditional approach of providing technical assistance in
the form of foreign "experts" has not been successful, has been over-utilized,
and is increasingly likely to be resisted.     More innovative approaches will
need to be devised; and this will need to be done within the context of close
and frank consultations between the GOG and the donor community including the
Bank.
VII. LESSONS
7.01        There are some important lessons to be learned from review of these
operations. Among these mention should be made of the following:
a.    One positive lesson for the Bank concerns the benefit of brain-
storming sessions before designing adjustment programs. Not only
is the ownership of the program unambiguously transferred to the
client government, but it assists the government in involving
various interest groups and economic decision-makers without whose
understanding of and cooperation with the program success cannot
be assured.
b.    There is an important lesson regarding how quickly it can be
expected that there will be a resurgence of private entrepreneur-
ship and investment in response to changes in the policy environ-



- 28 -
ment.   In a situation such as the Ghanaian, where a strategy of
public sector dominance has continued for thirty years, the culture
or tradition of private entrepreneurship has been essentially lost.
This reflects itself in an unwillingness to undertake equity
investment in ventures which promise a return only over the longer
term. It will take some time before the preference for trading
activities, in which borrowed funds can be turned over quickly,
will disappear. The few entrepreneurs will need to be repeatedly
assured that state controls and economic activity are unlikely to
be reasserted in the near future. Frequent and carefully struc-
tured consultations between the private sector and the government
can be the vehicle for providing this assurance and for giving the
private sector an opportunity to have an input in determining the
content of policies affecting it. Paradoxically, the promiised move
toward democratic government is new source of uncertainty for the
entrepreneur.
c.    The structural adjustment process in an economy such as Ghana's
requires that in addition to providing incentives to stimulate
private investment, the institutional arrangements for assisting
the private investor in mobilizing resources need to be put in
place, and the legal basis and administrative procedures need to
be clarified for potential investors as well as for bureaucrats.
All three requirements have to be addressed early in the adjustment
process. Some officials, representatives of the private sector,
and Bank staff have suggested that the investment response may have
been stronger had the financial sector adjustment and the legal
framework and administrative procedures affecting investors
received attention earlier in the sequence of actions.
d.    In an economy in which the public sector is dominant, the financial
implications of widespread retrenchment have to be given careful
consideration. It should not be assumed that the budget can take
on the burden of massive severance benefits without a disruptive
effect on other expenditure objectives.
e.    The SACs involved the setting up of a plethora of special units in
the government to coordinate and implement structural adjustment
measures. Now that significant effort has to be devoted to
integrating these special units into the regular fabric of
administration, it is not clear that the alternative approach of
strengthening existing, rather than creating substitute, units
would not have been the more effective approach over the longer
term. In future operations of this kind these alternatives should
be carefully weighed at the outset.
f.    The future role of institutions which are to lose their control
functions should be given more thought at the design stage of
structural adjustment programs.
g.    Mindful of the need to balance the interests of the client and of
staff,   at the beginning of a cycle of structural adjustment



- 29 -
lending the Bank should plan the deployment of staff with a view
to minimizing turnover during the cycle.
i.    A problem inherent in the structural adjustment strategy resides
in the immediate adverse impact on employment, the lag in the
creation of new jobs in expanding productive sectors, and in the
absence of an adequate safety net to ease the social problems
resulting from the loss of income of people especially in urban
areas.   The Bank's approach to poverty, correctly focussing on
longer term improvements in education and health services, does not
target the short term hardships associated with job loss under a
structural adjustment program.    Labor intensive projects, timed
appropriately can provide some relief, while making structural
adjustment more politically palatable.
j.    Ghanaian officials concur in the view that the success of the
adjustment program in many areas owes much to "hands on" super-
vision by Bank staff.    This allowed Bank expertise to buttress
Ghanaian efforts in critical areas, and permitted flexibility in
resolving unforseen and unforeseeable problems in implementation.
The norms of staff time provided for supervision of structural
adjustment operations should be reviewed in light of this experi-
ence.
k.    Last, but by no means least, is the importance of a high level of
commitment by the political leadership to structural adjustment
both in setting the overall tone for the implementation of the
process and for setting a singular priority for the top decision-
making body without which the crucial change in policies may not
be made promptly.

Background to the Bank's Involvement in Program Lending in Ghana
1.    Ghana achieved independence in 1957 with a buoyant economy based on immense
natural resources, a large pool of educated labor, and a well-developed infrastrcture. An
economic strategy of state-led and controlled industrialization led to excessive growth in the
public sector, inflation and serious price distortions. This strategy, coupled with the
atmosphere of political instability due to frequent coups, discouraged investment and
depressed output. Infrastructure and industrial plant deteriorated as operations and
maintenance expenditures were neglected. Educational standards and enrollment levels
declined and a substantial brain drain took place.
2.    In the latter half of the 1970s, real per capita income declined by almost 4 percent per
annum and inflation averaged almost 70 percent. Since the nominal exchange rate was not
devalued to compensate for inflation, exports of goods and services declined by 36 percent in
real terms over the same period. As external payments arrears accumulated, creditworthiness
declined and real imports fell in consequence by 14 percent over the same period. As a result
much of industry, agriculture and the transport fleet lay idle, starved of imported inputs and
spare parts.
3.     Faced with this disastrous situation, the Provisional National Defence Council
(PNDC), which came to power by military coup on December 31, 1981, developed an
Economic Recovery Program. The program, announced in April 1983, combined two main
elements: (i) a stabilization package designed to reduce inflation and achieve external
equilibrium; and (ii) a program to promote economic growth and export recovery, through a
realignment of incentives towards productive activities and through the rehabilitation of
infrastructure. These objectives were pursued through substantial devaluation of the cedi,
monetary and fiscal austerity, measures to increase the private sector's sbare of bank credit,
extensive price reform and a structured increase in the availability of foreign exchange to the
private sector for the rehabilitation of capital and the purchase of inputs.
The First Phase of Program Lending: Supporting Economic Recovery
4.     Between 1983 and 1986, the Economic Recovery Program was supported by three
IMF Stand-by facilities and two Compensating Financing Facilities (CFF) focussing on
measures to achieve stabilization (see Table 1). The objectives of output and export recovery
were supported by a series of program loans from the Bank: two Reconstruction Import
Credits (RICs I and II), an Export Rehabilitation Credit (ERP) and an Industrial Sector



- 34 -
Adjustment Credit (ISAC) which financed crucial imports of goods and technical assistance in
support of priority reforms in internal and external trade policy, the public enterprise sector,
and industrial policy (see Table 2). All of these credits financed imports targeted to facilitate
the rehabilitation and recovery of key sectors. .1/ The ERP was complemented by a Export
Rehabilitation Technical Assistance Credit (ERPTA)(see Table 2). These credits formed part
of a larger program of enhanced external assistance to Ghana - total assistance from Ghana's
Consultative Group (including IDA) averaged US$ 420 million per annum between 1984 and
1986.

5.      The iiiitial response of the economy to the policy reforms was heavily dampened by
the severe drought in 1983, infrastructure bottlenecks, lags in aid flows, and the burden of
absorbing about one million returnees from Nigeria in the early 1980s. Nevertheless the
Government persisted with its program of reforms, which paid rich dividends in terms of
increased output, improved fiscal performance, a deceleration of inflation, and enhanced aid
commitments in support of the program. GDP growth in the 1984-1986 period averaged
more than 6 percent, led by the strong recovery in agriculture. Manufacturing industry
responded strongly to the increased availability of imported materials and spares, with growth
averaging 14 percent per annum. Minerals production recovered sharply from the low levels
of 1983 following the restoration of rail-to-port services, while the services sector grew at 6
percent per annum. There was a healthy recovery in both savings and investment levels and,
for the first time in a decade, Ghana enjoyed three successive years of strong per capita
income growth.

The Second Phase of Program Lending: Supporting Structural Adjustment
(a) The First Structural Adjustment Credit
(i)   Preparation of the Credit
6.    The considerable progress achieved in stabilization, rehabilitation and restructuring
under the Economic Recovery Program, allowed the extension of Government's economic
strategy to address fundamental structural constraints. Following an extensive policy dialogue
in the context of the 1985 Country Economic Memorandum 2/, a government task force
prepared for submission to the November 1985 Consultative Group an outline of its policy
framework covering the 1986-1988 period. I/ This policy framework represented an
emerging consensus between the Government and IDA on a medium-term structural
adjustment program. The considerable economic and sector work and project-financed studies
undertaken jointly with Government during FY85 and FY86 informed this dialogue and
helped convert the policy framework into a detailed action program. This analytical work
included agricultural and industrial sector reviews, a Public Expenditure Review covering
eight sectors in April/May 1985, a major consultancy study on state enterprises, joint Bank-
Fund missions on resource mobilization and exchange and trade policy, and a number of
studies financed under the ERPTA credit, in particular on the cocoa sector. In addition, close
coordination with the analytical work carried out by the IMF was ensured by the holding of a
joint seminar on Ghanaian adjustment policy issues in January 1986, efforts to coordinate the
technical assistance offered by the two institutions, and by numerous other contacts.
7.    IDA missions in November 1985 and February/March 1986 assisted the Ghanaian
authorities in the integration of this preparatory work into a Structural Adjustment Program.
An appraisal mission for a first Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC I) visited Ghana in July
1986. This mission participated in a series of policy seminars organized by the Structural
Adjustment Program Team (see para. 27) and attended by members of the PNDC, PNDC
Secretaries including the Chairman of the Committee of Secretaries, key civil servants,
representatives of trade unions, employers and the Committees for the Defense of the
Revolution, and members of the press. 4/ As a result of these seminars, the issues in each
area were widely debated and a consensus emerged on the appropriate policy framework.
Further technical discussions were held with Government in December 1986, negotiations for
SAC I were conducted in the last week of February 1987, and the resulting program was

subsequently endorsed by the PNDC. The Credit was approved by the Bank's Board on April
14, 1987 and was declared effective on May 29 of the same year. 5/
(ii)  Design of SAC I
8.    The declared purpose of SAC I was to 'support the Government's structural
adjustment program which aims (i) to establish an incentives framework that stimulates
growth, encourages savings and investment, and strengthens the balance of payments; and (ii)
to improve resource use, particularly in the public sector, and direct resources to key areas of
adjustment, while ensuring fiscal and monetary stability...The policy framework will focus on
trade liberalization, cocoa sector policies, public expenditure policy, state-owned enterprise
reform, and public sector management." -/ The Credit was to provide support for
implementation of this framework during 1987 and 1988. Parallel financing was to be
provided by Canada, Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (see
Table 3); IDA approved adjustment credits in the education and financial sectors in December
1986 and May 1988 respectively; the IMF approved a three-year Extended Financing Facility
(EFF) and a three-year Structural Adjustment Facility (SAF) in November 1987, both of
which were replaced a year later by a three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF) (see Table 1). Complementary external resources were raised at the Consultative
Group meeting in May 1987. 7/
9.    The benefits projected for this strategy were "[improvement of] the Ghanaian
economy's growth prospects through a strong stimulus to exports and efficient import
substitution, improved incentives to private and public savings, the planned expansion in
public investment, and increased efficiency in the use of resources." It was further argued
that "the resultant recovery in exports and private sector remittances will improve the long-
run viability of the balance of payments. The exchange and trade reforms will shift incentives
further from trading and rent-seeking activities to production, and encourage manufacturers to
shift emphasis towards exports. The reduced role of the state in the productive sectors, the
planned rehabilitation of infrastructure, and the overall improvement in incentives, is intended
to improve the environment for the private sector. The public sector will be slimmer and
more efficient in the use of resources. State-owned enterprises, in particular, will be more
subject to market forces. Public investment is to be stepped up and prioritized to rehabilitate
essential economic and social infrastructure and support the recovery of the private sector.
5/    Finalization of SAC I was delayed by fiscal difficulties in 1986, the effects of a
substantial wage adjustment having been miscalculated. This also caused
delays in the conclusion of the SAF and EFF with the Fund.

The increased resource flows to health and education, and the restructuring of these
expenditures to emphasize primary education and primary health care, will reverse the
downward slide of these important sectors. Programs to monitor and minimize the social
costs of adjustment are under preparation." I/
10.   In quantitative terms, it was projected that economic growth would be sustained at
about 5 percent per annum over the 1987-1989 period. Investment was predicted to increase
from about 10 percent of GDP in 1986 to 23 percent in 1989, whilst national savings would
rise from 7 percent of GDP to 15 percent over the same period.
11.   It was explicitly recognized that this ambitious strategy was not without considerable
risks. Chief among these were:
(a)  that Government's weak implementation capacity would remain a key bottleneck,
particularly as the adjustment program would impose a considerable additional
burden on policy formulation and decision-making capabilities. To minimize this
risk three parallel technical assistance operations were launched to (a) strengthen
economic and financial management, particularly through extensive training
(Structural Adjustment Institutional Support Project, SAIS); (b) assist cocoa
sector reforms (Cocoa Rehabilitation Project); and (c) assist restructuring of the
public enterprise sector (Public Enterprise Technical Assistance Project, PETA)
(see Table 2). Furthermore, all Bank investment credits focussing on
rehabilitation also addressed implementation capacity issues. In addition, the
analytical work programs of both the Fund and the Bank were designed to
complement the Government's own policy analysis.
(b) that the supply response to the restructured incentives framework would be
delayed. The two factors seen as most likely to be significant obstacles to
increased output were continuing liquidity constraints and infrastructure
bottlenecks. The liquidity problem, which was already preoccupying policy
makers, resulted primarily from commercial banks with fragile balance sheets
being unwilling to lend to often inefficient firms squeezed by rising input prices
and the effects of tight demand management. A Financial Sector Adjustment
Credit was proposed to support a program of financial sector restructuring
intended to alleviate this constraint. The infrastructure problem was being
addressed under a number of projects, some of which were IDA-assisted, but it
was recognized that "projects were small in relation to needs and their
implementation is subject to a number of constraints". 9/
(c)  that those bearing the costs of adjustment would exert Dolitical pressure on the
Government to reverse its policies or to seriously undermine themi by granting
large wage increases unrelated to productivity gains. It was recognized that, at
least at the outset of the program, there could be groups such as the urban poor
who may be net losers from the adjustment process as both urban unemployment

and some key prices rise. However, it was argued that as resources shifted in
response to changed incentives and inflation was brought under control these
groups would become net gainers. Meanwhile, the costs of frictional
unemployment would be mitigated by a range of measures including financial
compcnsation for retrenched employees, public works programs, and credit
schemes for the self-employed. It was emphasized that "the success of the
reforms to date is partly due to the Government's careful efforts to explain the
rationale of the program to the general public. Continued effectiveness in
communications will be critical to the success of the program". 10/
(d) that adverse exogenous shocks from climatic or commodity price behavior,
particularly for cocoa, would have a serious impact on growth and could only be
financed at the cost of very high levels of debt service. However, it was argued
that "with the increasing strength of the economy, exogenous shocks may be
better absorbed". 11/
(iii)  Implementation of SAC I
12.   Policies on External Trade and Payments. Liberalization of the external trade and
payments system was the centerpiece of the structural adjustment program, building on
important measures taken during the economic recovery phase. In February 1987, the official
and auction rates of exchange were unified. 12/ Over the 1987-1988 period access to the
auction was progressively widened, particularly as regards the import of consumer goods, and
the exchange rate gradually depreciated. By February 1988, there were effectively no
foreign exchange restrictions on the import of goods 13/, except for five items on a
"negative list" and certain goods prohibited for social reasons. To promote the development
of a competitive foreign exchange market, the Government approved the creation of foreign
exchange bureaus that were free to set their own buying and selling rates for foreign
currency. 14/ However, a substantial differential persisted between the auction and bureau
rates since the auction did not yet cover all current transactions and the bureaus were few in
number.

contrary to the proposal of the IMF to establish an interbank market in foreign
exchange in preference to the bureaus.

13.   By 1987, Ghana's import tariff levels were already moderate by developing country
standards, with most tariffs in the 20 to 25 percent range. However, differences in sales tax
rates on imports and on domestic sales accentuated variations in effective protection.
Consequently, the Government revised the sales tax structure in the 1988 budget, unifying
sales tax on domestic and imported goods, applying the sales tax on imports to the duty-
inclusive value, and simplifying the rate structure to four rates. 15/ Import tariffs were
reduced by a uniform 5 percentage points for most goods bearing duty rates higher than
15 percent, thereby further compressing the rate structure. In addition, the special tax
on imports of excisable products was henceforth levied on an ad valorem basis rather
than as a specific tax. 16/
14.   Cocoa Sector Policies. The main policy objective for the cocoa sector was to increase
production though improved incentives; in particular, this was to be achieved without undue
pressure on fiscal revenues by means of trimming the operational expenses of the Ghana
Cocoa Board (COCOBOD). In agreement with IDA, the Government raised the cocoa
producer price to 33 percent of the export price for the 1987/88 crop year (from 23
percent the previous year), and to 42 percent of the export price for 1988/89. 17/
Agricultural surveys carried out in 1988 showed strong evidence that cocoa farmers were
beginning to respond to these improved incentives. To restructure its operations in order to
cut its operating costs, COCOBOD laid off 12,000 of its staff, reduced its transport costs,
ceased production on 52 of its 92 plantations, and sold off majority ownership of its
insecticide plant. In addition, a corporate plan involving further restructuring through
1990 was agreed between COCOBOD and IDA, and a performance agreement between
Government and COCOBOD was signed.
15.   Public Resource Management. During 1987-88, the Government had two major
priorities for public expenditure management. First, the allocation of operations and
maintenance expenditures, particularly in agriculture, health and education, was to be
improved. In this regard, a Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP) task force
completed a study on recurrent expenditure norms in late 1987, the results of which were
used in preparation of the 1989 budget. Secondly, planning of public expenditures,
particularly those for investment, was to be made more efficient: April 1987 saw the
introduction of the first three-year rolling public expenditure program, of which the public
investment program (PIP) was a key element. This became an annual exercise and the 1988-
90 public expenditure program was agreed with IDA following missions in November
1987, and January and February 1988 to prepare the public expenditure review.
16.   In order to improve domestic resource mobilization, the Government introduced
several tax reform measures in the 1987 and 1988 budgets aimed at realigning taxes,
expanding taxation of consumption, and strengthening tax administration. 1988 tax revenues

were 36 percent higher than those in 1987, which were in turn 53 percent higher than in
1986.
17.   Reform of State-owned Fnterprises. Reforms in the state-owned enterprise sector were
intended to encourage efficiency through an appropriate policy framework, initiate divestiture
of state-owned ente.rprises (SOEs) that could be better operated by the private sector, initiate
liquidation of non-viable SOEs, and strengthen the management of enterprises remaining in
the public sector.
18.   During 1987-88, a policy statement on SOEs and guidelines for SOE access to
budgetary funds were finalized, and a study of cross-debts amongst SOEs and Government
was completed. However, the SOE divestiture program started slowly, due in part to
difficulties in updating accounts, valuing assets and meeting the net financial liabilities of
those SOEs to be divested. By mid-1988, the divestiture of 5 SOEs and the liquidation of
5 others had been initiated; by the end of the year, 10 SOEs had reached the final stage of
liquidation and Government's shares in six joint ventures had been offered to their foreign
partners. However, the extent of divestiture and liquidation remained modest in relation to
the size of the state-owned enterprise sector.
19.   Corporate plans and performance agreements were one means by which the
performance of SOEs remaining in the public sector was to be monitored and improved. Of
14 priority SOEs, 10 had prepared corporate plans by the end of 1987 and four of these
were translated into draft performance agreements. Of these the agreement between
COCOBOD and the Government was signed in early 1988. By the end of 1988, the
Government had finalized the corporate plans and performance agreements of all 14 priority
SOEs.
20.   Civil Service Reform. Improving the efficiency of the civil service was a central
objective of the adjustment program. The reforms aimed at reducing staffing levels, raising
remuneration, and increasing salary differentials. The redeployment program experienced
considerable start-up problems. Although there was widespread recognition that the lower
ranks were overstaffed, identification of those to be redeployed was difficult in the absence of
adequate information. In addition, it took some time to sort out the amount and arrangements
for termination payments. Nevertheless by the end of 1987, some 11,300 civil servants had
been retrenched compared to the target of 15,000. A further 12,000 were removed from
the payroll in 1988, based on the interim findings of a stafring and functional review.
However, some poorly controlled recruitment did take place (equivalent to about 25 percent
of the number redeployed) although some of those recruited were people with scarce skills.
No progress was achieved in 1987 with the objective of increasing salary differentials in order
to attract better qualified staff to senior positions. In 1988 this even received a slight setback
in that an across-the-board salary increase resulted in a small compression of the salary
structure.
21.   Macroeconomic Performance. Although it is not to be expected that a structural
adjustment program would have very significant macroeconomic impact in the short term,
macroeconomic performance was broadly favorable in 1987 and 1988. Despite the adverse
effect of erratic rainfall on agricultural production in 1987, the economy grew at almost 5
percent rising to 6 percent in 1988 (see Table 4). Agriculture rebounded in 1988 as a result
of better weather and the use of improved technological packages in certain areas. Export



- 43 -
volumes of timber and gold rose substantially in response to the rehabilitation of infrastructure
and the continued depreciation of the cedi. The introduction and subsequent broadening of
the foreign exchange auction increased the availability of materials and spare parts for the
manufacturing sector, which was consequently able to plan production for the first time in
many years.
22.   However, the sustainabilty of these high growth rates was put in doubt by
disappointing performance on investment and savings. By 1988 gross investment was still
only about 11 percent of GDP compared to the initial target for 1989 of 23 percent (indeed,
by 1989 it reached only 14 percent). Similarly, the national savings share of GDP had
attained only 6 percent in 1988, far short of the 15 percent target for 1989 (indeed, in 1989 it
turned out to be only 8 percent). 18/
23.   Total tax revenues grew strongly over the period despite a slippage in 1988 primarily
due to reduced cocoa export taxes. Recurrent expenditures declined steadily as a share of
GDP, although at some cost to desirable operations and maintenance expenditures. The
consequent increase in public savings, supplemented by a rapid rise in foreign financing (on
mostly concessional terms), allowed the Government to both increase capital expenditures and
reduce its indebtedness to the domestic banking system.
24.   Inflation remained high in 1987 at 40 percent (compared to 24 percent in 1986), but
declined to 31 percent in 1988. This decline represented the effects of tighter monetary and
fiscal control, as well as the working through of inflationary shocks from the rapid
depreciation of the cedi in late 1986, food production shortfalls in 1987 and sharp petroleum
price increases in the same year.
25.   The overall balance of payments improved sharply allowing a substantial accumulation
of reserves and a reduction in external arrears. This resulted from higher inflows of
development assistance, lower scheduled amortization of public debt and increased net private
transfers. The latter probably reflected the more appropriate exchange rate, the emergence of
new investment opportunities and renewed confidence in the stability of the economy.
However, the current account deficit worsened under pressure from falling cocoa export
receipts (as a result of adverse climatic and price developments) underscoring the need to
promote non-traditional exports.
26.   Second Tranche Release. The second tranche review concluded that the specific
release conditions had been substantially met and that general progress on implementation of
the structural adjustment program had been satisfactory. Consequently, the tranche was
released on May 10, 1988, only three months after the initial target date.
1g/   However, it should be noted that the statistical series have been revised
downwards since the initial targets were set, such that the 1986 starting point
for investment should have been 9 percent instead of 10 percent, and that for
savings 5 percent instead of 7 percent.

27.   Cred, Monitoring and Administration. To prepare and monitor the structural
adjustment program, the Government created a Structural Adjustment Program Team (SAPT)
headed by the Chairman of the Committee of PNDC Secretaries, with the PNDC Secretary of
MFEP as Vice Chairman, and the latter's Deputy as Secretary. SAPT was responsible for (i)
monitoring and evaluating the progress of ongoing reforms as well as their impact on the
economy; (ii) initiating preparatory steps for further adjustment measures; and (iii) liaison
with the World Bank for periodic reviews of the program. The SAPT was supported by a
secretariat (SAPSEC) of technical officials headed by a PNDC Secretary, to which was linked
the Project Management Unit of SAIS. Until early 1989, SAPSEC was headed by the PNDC
Secretary for Fuel and Power (who was also responsible for the National Revenue Service),
which created some coordination difficulties with MFEP.
28.   From the Bank side, monitoring of the program was carried out through numerous
missions specifically to review progress under SAC I, and the related SAIS, PETA, and
Cocoa Rehabilitation projects. In addition, public expenditure review missions and
supervision missions for various sector adjustment and investment credits contributed to
monitoring of the program, as did the continual involvement of Resident Mission staff.
29.   The proceeds of the Credit were used exclusively for the financing of foreign exchange
costs of eligible imports through the foreign exchange auction of the Bank of Ghana.
Procurement procedures were designed to permit rapid use of funds while ensuring efficiency
and economy. Except for a few exclusions such as luxury and defense items and foodgrains,
any imports were eligible for financing, although petroleum imports were subject to a ceiling. 19/
There were some start-up disbursement difficulties, due mainly to slow transmission of the
necessary documentation for replenishment of the special account in the Bank of Ghana. In
late 1987 therefore, special accounts were created in certain commercial banks, which
effectively accelerated this process. Some procedural difficulties remained but these were
largely cleared up during 1987-88, aided by a study on the utilization of concessional
assistance financed by a IDA Special Project Financing Facility.
(b) The Second Structural Adjustment Credit
(i)   Preparation of the Credit
30.   Preparation of SAC II was considerably less intensive than for SAC I since the policy
framework it was supporting developed out of experience under the first phase of structural
adjustment. Indeed, as SAC I was monitored, preparation of SAC II increasingly became an
integral part of that process - particularly after the successful second tranche review of SAC I
in February 1988. In addition, the process of preparation was assisted by the tripartite
formulation of the first Policy Framework Paper (PFP), and by Bank analytical work,
including particularly the 1989 Country Economic Memorandum and the annual public
19/   The supplemental credit (A025-1-GH) signed on October 30, 1987 included
foodgrains as eligible imports after a foodgrain production shortfall in Ghana
during 1987.

expenditure reviews. 20/ 21/ Appraisal was carried out in June 1988, in more
conventional style than for SAC I (see para. 7), and negotiations were held in November of
that year. The Credit was approved by the Bank's Board on April 18, 1989 and was declared
effective on June 6 of the same year.
(ii)  Design of SAC II
31.   The stated purpos of the program supported by SAC II was to "further improve the
incentive structure to stimulate growth, encourage savings and investment, and strengthen the
balance of payments... [and to support] increased efficiency in the use of resources by the
public sector, while ensuring a stable fiscal and monetary stance.. .The program of actions
designed to achieve these aims...focus on trade and exchange rate policy, tax policies and
administration, specific private sector development initiatives, public expenditure
management, state-owned enterprise reforms, and civil service reforms". 22/ The program
of actions under SAC II placed more emphasis on tax reform and specific measures to
promote private sector development than did SAC I; broad-based cocoa sector reform formed
part of the preparation phase of SAC II, but the institutional and marketing components were
eventually subsumed under the Cocoa Rehabilitation Credit. SAC II was to provide support
for implementation of the policy framework during 1989 and 1990. Parallel financing was to
be provided by Canada, the EEC, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden,
and the UK (see Table 3); the IMF continued to provide resources under its three-year ESAF
approved in November 1988; IDA approved a second adjustment credit in the education
sector in May 1990. Complementary external resources for Ghana were raised at the
Consultative Group meeting of February/March 1989. 23/
32.   In qualitative terms, the expected benefits from pursuit of this strategy were similar to
those projected for the first phase (see para. 9). It was predicted that "the rise in the share of
investment in GDP will lay the foundation of future growth, and the.. .growth in national
savings will lower Ghana's dependence on foreign savings in the future. The continued
reforms in exchange and trade policies will serve to promote non-traditional exports and
stimulate new import substitution activities in the private sector. Reforms in the structure and
administration of taxes will strengthen public finances while improving incentives to work,
save and invest. Better public expenditure management will concentrate public resources on
high priority areas.. .Special attention will be given to.. .alleviating poverty.. .State-owned
enterprise reforms are expected to lead to a slimmer and more efficient public sector.

Changes in the size and management of the civil service will increase [its) effectiveness".
2AW
33.   The ajantitative targets for the second phase of structural adjustment were, however,
less ambitious than for the first phase (see para. 10). Although growth was still projected to
average 5 percent per annum, investment was projected to rise to only 16 percent of GDP by
1990 and national savings to only 8.5 percent by the same year. These projections reflected
the tempering of the optimism of SAC I by the experience of actual implementation of the
adjustment process in Ghana.
34.   Three principal risks were identified as potentially threatening achievement of the
program's objectives and were similar to those identified for SAC I 2.1:
(a) the Government's implementation capacity was cited as still being weak,
particularly as "measures to attract trained Ghanaians back into public service
have so far met with only limited success, and the motivation of the civil service
continues to be low". 26/ Measures to reduce this risk focussed on training
programs and continued technical assistance under the SAIS, Cocoa
Rehabilitation and PETA projects.
(b) the discussion of the weak supply response focussed more on the role of
investment than under SAC I, since opportunities for utilizing spare capacity and
the relatively inexpensive rehabilitation of existing capacity were being
progressively exhausted. Liquidity constraints and infrastructure bottlenecks
were again cited as contributing to the problem, and financial sector adjustment,
public investment and the liberalized foreign exchange regime were proffered as
solutions. However, it was also noted that "remaining policy impediments may
contribute to the reluctance of entrepreneurs to advance beyond the project
identification stage" and that "despite [the Government's] efforts, renewed private
investment will need to involve a shift in perceptions and confidence in the
durability of the policies shaping Ghana's economic future, and it is difficult to
judge when patient commitment by the Government to appropriate policies will
begin to bring results". 27/
(c)  the risk of opposition to some aspects of the structural adjustment process was
again cited. Perceived inequities in the distribution of adjustment costs between
24/   op.cit., P(i).
25I   However, the risk of adverse exogenous shocks was not raised, even though
neither the weather nor commodity price behavior had become significantly
more predictable. Moreover, both these risks had proved to be justified in the
SAC I period.

different groups were now added to the SAC I explanation of costs preceding
benefits for some groups. However, it was argued that "Government should be
able to forestall such socio-political risks by balancing and timing higher service
costs with improved service provision, mitigating transitional unemployment
through achieving overall economic growth, providing generous compensation
benefits to redeployees, and implementing retraining and job creation projects
under the Program to Mitigate the Social Costs of Adjustment (PAMSCAD)." It
was again noted that 'the success of the reforms to date is partly due to the
Government's careful efforts to explain the rationale of the program to the
general public and continued effectiveness in communications will be critical to
the success of the program" 28/

foreign exchange markets continued in 1989 and 1990. In January 1989, the auction was
expanded to include all bonafide requests for the transfer of profits and dividends. In
December of the same year, it delegated to authorized dealer banks and eligible foreign
exchange bureaus the responsibility of determining the eligibility of individual bids for foreign
exchange. In April 1990, the auction was transformed from a retail to a wholesale market
and interbank foreign exchange transactions were authorized. At the same time the auction
was extended to include service payments for approved private external borrowing.
36.   The foreign exchange market adjusted smoothly to these structural reforms. Improved
functioning of the auction, expansion in the number of market participants, and an increase in
foreign exchange channeled through the bureaus encouraged a gradual convergence of the
auction and bureau exchange rates; by August 1990 the spread between the two markets had
declined to about 1 percent from 40-50 percent in early 1989.
37.   On trade liberalization, the objectives were to continue to rationalize the structure of
import duties and trade taxes, and to reduce special taxes on certain imports. The process of
unifying sales and excise tax rates across comparable imported and domestically produced
goods was completed, along with elimination of inconsistencies in the determination of the tax
base. However, in the area of tariff reduction progress was mixed. The import duty rate on
semi-processed intermediate goods was reduced from 15 to 10 percent, and the special tax on
textile imports was lowered from 40 to 10 percent, but 1990 saw the introduction of a super
sales tax on luxuries (with rates ranging from 75 to 500 percent). Since in practice this
applied only to imports, effective protection was raised to quite high rates for some goods.
29/
38.   Cocoa Sector Policies. Pursuit of the closely related objectives of improving cocoa
farmer incentives and reducing COCOBOD costs continued in the SAC II period. The impact

- 49 -
of the sharp fall in Ghanaian cocoa prices on farmers was cushioned to some extent by an
increase in output and a rise in their share of total revenues, producer prices for 1989/90
and 1990/91 having been agreed with IDA (representing 42 percent and 47 percent of the
export price respectively). However, this increase in the farmers' share could only be
moderate since it came more at the expense of tax revenue than of COCOBOD expenditures
as progress on COCOBOD operational reform slowed, thus the long-run target of 55 percent
for producer share failed to be reached. COCOBOD employment levels remained high,
plantation divestiture was minimal, and the privatization of transport and input supply was not
completed.
39.   Public Expenditure Management. On recurrent expenditures, the key issue continued
to be the size of the wage bill and the decompression of the civil service wage structure. The
Govermnent achieved a decompression ratio of 7.7:1 in 1989 (in line with agreements
reached between the Government and IDA) and 9.5:1 in 1990, and did so within the resource
envelope agreed with the Fund. 30/ Agreement was also reached between the
Government and the Bank on the 1990-92 PIP, which continued to concentrate on physical
infrastructure (58 percent), followed by productive sectors (21 percent) and social sectors (19
percent). Encouraging progress was made on implementing planned investment expenditures.
40.   Tax Policy and Administration. In the period of adjustment supported by SAC II, tax
reform took a higher profile than had previously been the case, building on the notable
improvements in tax administration which had taken place earlier. 31/ The main
objectives of the reforms were (i) to increase revenues while reducing reliance on cocoa; and
(ii) to enhance the contribution of the tax system to growth by reducing tax rates and
broadening the tax base. Although tax revenues did not increase in relation to GDP between
1988 and 1990, the share of cocoa revenue dropped sharply from 17 percent to 12 percent
over the period. There was also significant movement away from narrow-based production
taxes to broader-based consumption taxes.In particular, the company income tax rate and
some import duties were reduced, and vehicles and petrol were subject to higher
taxation. The level of personal income tax relief was raised and brackets were expanded
significantly; some loopholes on non-taxable allowances were closed. In addition, the rate
structure of capital gains taxation was modified and its administration rationalized. During
1990, the Government, with the assistance of the Bank and the Fund, evaluated the impact of
the tax system on the incentives for domestic savings and investment; key proposals from
these studies were incorporated into a program of measures to be implemented in 1991 and
1992. 32/

Investment and Sustained Development.



- 50 -
41.   Improvements continued to be made in the administration of taxes. The ASYCUDA
computer system was installed at various ports of entry to cover the calculation of import
duties and sales taxes. Progress was made in the introduction of a unique taxpayer
identification number, and a pilot test of the feasibility of replacing the current ring system of
sales tax with a credit system was introduced in one subsector in 1990.
42.   Reform of SOEs. The slow overall progress on divestment continued into the SAC II
period, although Govermnent divested or liquidated the number of enterprises to which it
had been committed in its 1989 program. However, in late 1989, certain institutional
reforms were made with a view to accelerating the process. The Divestiture Implementation
Committee (DIC) was separated from the State Enterprises Commission, new members and a
secretariat to the DIC were appointed, and a generally higher political profile was given to its
activities. In consequence, by mid-1990 implementation of the program agreed with IDA
for 1990 was more assertive than had previously been the case. Moreover, compared to the
1988-90 program, the companies on the 1991-92 divestiture list approved by DIC in late 1990
were in general larger, covered a wider range of activities, and could be privatized rather than
liquidated.
43.   In order to assist in the effort to increase the efficiency of those enterprises remaining
in the public sector, corporate plans continued to be formulated and performance agreements
concluded, including updating 13 such agreements for priority SOEs in 1990. 33/
However, monitoring of actual performance was weakened by institutional deficiencies and
the non-completion of enterprise accounts. In addition, performance was sometimes
undermined by Government delaying decisions on tariff increases, and failing to pay bills and
provide financial transfers promptly.
44.   Civil Service Reform. In the adjustment period supported by SAC II, progress on
civil service reform was both faster and deeper than had previously been the case. The
retrenchment program was implemented smoothly with almost 14,000 staff being laid off in
1989 and slightly over 12,000 in 1990. During 1990, the recently-improved information
system on staffing levels showed that controls over new recruitment needed to be tightened,
and a number of actions were taken to this effect. In order to sustain and extend these
informational improvements, a program to integrate the payroll and personnel
management systems commenced in 1989, although this was later than originally envisaged
and underwent further delays in 1990.
45.   As noted above (see para. 39), substantial progress was made in decompressing the
salary structure of the civil service. 34/ After taking into account changes in the structure
of personal income taxes, real salary gains were made at all but the lowest grades. However,
33/   In fact, the tranche release condition specified 14 SOEs, but active discussion
on divestment of one of these (State Gold Mining Corporation) was taking
place, and conclusion of a performance agreement was therefore considered
unnecessary.
34/   However, it should be noted that this decompression was significantly more
substantial for the relatively few civil servants at the very top of the salary
structure than for those just below.



- 51 -
although these real wage increases succeeded in attracting relatively highly-qualified recruits,
little was left over to improve real remuneration for those already in the civil service.
46.   Analysis carried out as part of the program indicated that the grading and occupational
structure suffered from several weaknesses. Salary increases for promotion were often small
and inconsistent; in the absence of job evaluation, pay scales were not based on proper
assessments of job weight or content; the system was complex and difficult to administer. In
order to revise the structure, with a view to supporting career development and attracting
more skilled personnel, the groundwork for a comprehensive regrading exercise was laid
during 1990. 351 In the area of civil service management, the Management Services
Division (MSD) of the Office of the Head of the Civil Service continued to assist agencies to
bring about efficiency improvements through job inspections. The MSD also began to
undertake management reviews with a view to rationalizing organizational structures and
reducing duplication.
47.   Private Sector Development. Many elements of the program were aimed at making
the economic environment more attractive for private investment, such as external trade and
payments policy reform, financial sector restructuring, divestiture of SOEs, and improved
public investment planning. More specifically, the Government implemented a program to
release private blocked capital and dividends and held meetings with private sector
representatives to discuss economic policy issues. MIGA helped organize a conference to
promote direct foreign investment in Ghana in 1990, which met with some success. Also
during the SAC II period, the Ghana Investment Centre streamlined its procedures for
registering enterprises with foreign participation.
48.   Poverty Alleviation. Over the program period access of the poor to basic social
services to combat illiteracy, lack of skills, ill health and malnutrition has improved; social
indicators show increased primary school enrollments, improved nutrition and more extensive
immunization. In addition to these improvements in the human capital aspects of poverty,
favorable movements in the rural terms of trade and increased agricultural productivity appear
to have brought about an increase in incomes amongst the self-employed in agriculture - the
main area of concentration of poverty in Ghana.
49.   As to more targeted poverty alleviation measures, progress under PAMSCAD
remained behind schedule, but implementation accelerated during the period. Expenditures
focussed on assisting retrenched public sector employees, labor-intensive priority works, food
distribution, and community initiative projects.
50.   Macroeconomic Performance. The strong growth performance of previous years
continued in 1989, with GDP growing by 5.1 percent (see Table 4). In 1990 growth slowed
to 3 percent largely as a result of drought, agricultural growth dropping from 4 percent in
1989 to minus 2.4 percent in 1990. Industrial growth moderated to about 4 percent in both
years (from about 7 percent in 1988), but this was largely due to the buoyancy of the mining
sector; in manufacturing, value added rose by only about 3 percent a year. However, a
variety of data sources suggest that the structure of manufacturing was in the process of
transformation: certain industries were in decline as the effective protection afforded by the
35/   The new grading structure is due to be ready for full implementation in 1992.



- 52 -
trade and payments regime had been reduced with liberalization, whilst others were
benefitting from the new framework of incentives. Significantly, the strong growth in non-
traditional exports of previous years was sustained in 1990 (although there was some slippage
in 1989).
51.   In contrast with the SAC I period, investment and savings levels under SAC II were
close to target at 15.8 percent and 8.2 percent of GDP respectively (against targets of 16
percent and 8.5 percent). This reflected both stronger performance and greater realism in
setting targets. However, investment was still barely above the levels necessary just to
replace depreciated capital. Moreover, by 1990 private investment still accounted for only
half of total investment, and much of this was concentrated in only one sector, mining, which
has relatively few linkages to the rest of the economy.
52.   Fiscal performance in 1989 was on target with a budget deficit of 3.1 percent of GDP,
but this slipped slightly to 4.4 percent in 1990, largely because of shortfalls in tax receipts.
These shortfalls resulted from the economic slowdown, lower tax rates on income, and falling
cocoa tax revenue. However, the availability of foreign financing allowed Government to both
increase development expenditures and retire debt to the banking system. In addition,
external arrears were fully repaid during the course of 1990.
53.   Inflation fell to 25 percent in 1989 (from 31 percent in 1988) but rose again to 37
percent in 1990, despite a sharp deceleration in monetary expansion. These continued high
levels of inflation were due primarily to the lagged effects of monetary expansion, poor
harvests of food crops, and increases in petroleum product prices. The slow adaptation of
inflationary expectations may also have played a role. Whatever the precise combination of
causal factors of inflation in Ghana, the failure to reduce it to more acceptable levels indicated
the continued existence of serious supply rigidities.
54.   Export earnings declined in 1989, but recovered in 1990 to their 1988 level. This
trend largely reflected the sharp falls in the prices of cocoa and gold. Indeed, the terms of
trade deteriorated by 26 percent over the period, and the current account deficit widened in
consequence (from 4.9 percent of GDP in 1987-88 to 5.8 percent in 1989 and 7.6 percent in
1990). Nevertheless, because net aid disbursements rose and non-concessional debt
amortization declined, a sizable overall balance of payments surplus was maintained. In
addition, the ratio of debt service to exports continued to fall.
55.   Overall, macroeconomic performance in 1989 and 1990 indicates that economic
reforms have helped the Ghanaian economy become more resilient in the face of external
shocks, such as poor weather and deteriorating terms of trade. At the same time, underlying
economic trends show that policy reform in some areas needs to be strengthened to lay a
firmer base for sustainable growth, particularly through increased private investment.
56.   Second and Third Tranche Release. The initial program of actions proved slightly
optimistic in its estimate of the time required to satisfy the specific conditions for release of
the second and third tranches 36/; these were programmed for 1990 in January and March
respectively. In the event, all the conditions were judged to have been met and overall
36/   Third tranche conditionality concerned the divestiture program.



- 53 -
implementation progress to have been satisfactory by July 17, 1990 on which date both
tranches were released.
57.   Credit Monitoring and Administration. The institutional arrangements for the
Government's monitoring of the structural adjustment program under SAC II, were similar to
those under SAC I (see para. 27). However, at the end of 1989, responsibility for SAPSEC
became fully that of MFEP. In addition, later that year the Economic Liaison Unit was
created and biannual high-level policy review meetings were instituted, with a view to
increased consensus building around the initiatives to be taken under the program, and
ensuring coordination between the PNDC and the SAP Team. The Bank's monitoring of the
program was carried out in essentially the same fashion as under SAC I (see para. 28).
58.   As under SAC I, the proceeds of the Credit were used exclusively for the financing of
foreign exchange costs of eligible imports through the foreign exchange auction of the Bank
of Ghana. Procurement procedures were designed to permit rapid use of funds while ensuring
efficiency and economy. Except for a few exclusions such as luxury and defense items, any
imports were eligible for financing, although petroleum imports were subject to a ceiling.
No significant problems were experienced on disbursements, since the system improvements
made under SAC I were maintained (see para. 29).
Why Were Some Components of the Program More Successful than Others?
59.   It is clear that the structural adjustment program in Ghana has met with considerable
success; much progress has been made in implementing structural reform and the
macroeconomic data show major improvement. However, much remains to be done, and
certain important lessons can be learned for the design and implementation of follow-on
credits.
60.   Overall commitment by the Government of Ghana to pursuit of the objectives of its
structural adjustment program has been exceptionally great. However, the degree of
commitment appears to have varied from one component of the program to another, and for
given components over time. Although difficult to measure, the degree of commitment has
played an important role in determining the success of certain components. For example, the
slow progress on divestiture, at least until 1990, contrasts with the pace of civil service
reform, even though both were politically very difficult areas. It seems that the Government
was simply more persuaded of the wisdom of civil service reform than of divestiture. In this
regard, the Bank has some role to play in consensus building - for example, the sense that
commitment was greater under SAC I may be related to the participatory approach to
appraisal instigated by the Government (see para. 7). The Bank also has a role to play in
avoiding unrealistic expectations of progress in areas where consensus is still being built; in
this regard, flexibility was shown at early stages of the divestiture program.
61.   Combined with the effect of the degree of commitment is the relative capabilities of
the implementing agencies concerned. Comparatively strong institutions involved in tax,
public expenditure and civil service reform help explain relative success in those areas;
similarly the restructuring of responsibilities for divestiture (see para. 42) assisted the
acceleration of progress in that component of the program. In this regard, the effective use of
parallel technical assistance operations played a role in providing necessary reinforcement;
SAIS provided training, and assisted in the design and implementation of reforms of tax,



- 54 -
public expenditure and civil service policies very effectively 37/, whilst PETA's
contribution appears to have been more modest in the area of public enterprise reform. 38/
62.   Parallel credits also had a potentially important role to play in sustaining and
deepening dialogue between the Government and the Bank on specific issues. For example,
the emphasis on the cocoa sector was much less in SAC II than in SAC I because the
institutional and marketing reform elements were subsumed under the Cocoa Rehabilitation
Project. In the event, the planned study on the reform of cocoa marketing was not carried out
and a key opportunity for further dialogue on reducing COCOBOD operational costs was
thereby missed. In the face of fiscal pressure, this effectively prevented full achievement of
the SAC II objective of improving cocoa producer incentives. In contrast, SAIS reviews
proved an effective medium for dialogue on public expenditure management and civil service
reform.
63.   As experience with structural adjustment developed in Ghana, it became increasingly
apparent that the response of private investment to the changed incentive framework was
considerably less than had been expected. In consequence, increasing emphasis was placed on
identifying specific measures to promote private investment rather than assuming that
macroeconomic stability, improved infrastructure and the "right prices" would be sufficient.
SAC II had a greater focus on these issues than did SAC I, yet private investment levels
remained below the levels necessary for sustainable growth. In 1990, the Government and
IDA conducted a study on constraints to private investment 39/, which contributed to the
design of the third phase of structural adjustment in Ghana, supported by a credit to Promote
Private Investment and Sustainable Growth (PPPISD - see Table 2). The program to promote
private investment will focus on (i) further tax reform to improve incentives to save and
invest; (ii) taking steps to make the regulatory framework more consistent with the liberalized
economy; (iii) maintaining the momentum of reforms designed to increase the efficiency with
which public resources are used; and (iv) making further progress on SOE reforms.
II. PROGRAM REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Economic Performance under the Structural Adjustment Program
64.   Over the period 1989-1990, the national income increased by an average annual rate of
4.1 percent. This compares with the average annual growth of 5.5 percent over 1987-1988.
The weakening in the pace of output growth was particularly evident in 1990, with real GDP
37/   In the case of civil service reform, parallel technical assistance from the UK
Overseas Development Administration played a critical role.
38/   Also worthy of note in this regard are the various studies financed by IDA
Special Project Preparation Facilities, in particular those on sales tax collection,
budgetary reform, taxation of investment, and the Ghana Statistical Service.

Department, October 1990.

growing at about 3 percent. This deterioration in growth performance was due in large
measure to delayed and inadequate rainfall which adversely affected non-cocoa agricultural
output. Thus, in contrast to the strong growth in agricultural output of 4.2 percent in 1989,
the agricultural sector recorded a negative growth of 2.4 percent in 1990. The developments
in 1990 underline the fragility of the Ghanaian economy, dependent as it predominantly is on
rain-fed agriculture. Growth in the manufacturing sector has also slowed down considerably
in recent years, recording a growth rate of 3 percent in 1989 and an even slower 2.6 percent
in 1990, as compared with an average annual growth rate of 7.5 percent in 1987-1988. The
mining subsector (gold in particular), however, recorded much stronger growth.
65.   Inflation as measured by changes in the consumer price index fell from an annual
average of 31.5 percent in 1988 to 25.2 percent in 1989, but increased to 37.2 percent in
1990. The acceleration of inflation in 1990 was due principally to food price increase brought
about by poor harvests and the increases in prices of petroleum products.
66.   The balance of payments position in 1989 and 1990 was adversely affected by the
weakening in the world prices for cocoa. The price per metric ton averaged US$1,372 in
1989-1990, as compared with US$2,190 in 1987-88. The value of merchandise exports for
1990 is provisionally put at US$826 million, representing a nominal increase of 2.3 percent
over 1989. This slight improvement in earnings was due mainly to an increase in gold
earnings, but also to increased earnings from manganese, residual oil, and diamonds. The
current account deficit (including official transfers) widened from US$83 million in 1989 to
US$259 million in 1990, but a positive net capital account position produced an overall
surplus of US$85 million in 1990. Although this was lower than in 1989, it allowed the
retirement of external payments arrears, such that by the end of June 1990, Ghana had no
official arrears. Total external indebtedness increased from US$2.9 billion at the end of
1989, to US$3.1 billion at the end of 1990. The 1990 figure is equivalent to about 53 percent
of GDP. The debt service ratio (including repayments to the Fund) declined from 58 percent
in 1989 to 40 percent in 1990; if payments to the Fund are excluded, the ratio drops from 33
percent in 1989 to 23 percent in 1990.
67.   Although there has been significant progress in savings and investment performance in
Ghana since 1983, this still lags behind the average for Sub-Saharan Africa. The share of
investment and gross domestic savings in GDP in 1990 were 16 percent and 11.5 percent
respectively. A number of measures have been taken, and more are planned, to tap more
effectively than hitherto the resources of the private sector in this regard.
Economic Reforms under the Structural Adjustment Program
68.   One of the most significant stages in liberalizing the Ghanaian economy has been the
dramatic improvement in access to realistically-priced foreign exchange. This has had
beneficial knock-on effects in many key areas, but especially in adjusting the terms of trade
internally, and providing undistorted profit signals, which discloses Ghana's real comparative
advantage as a producer. Today the foreign exchange auction and bureau markets have
effectively converged.
69.   After foreign exchange, the second most important price given to the Ghanaian
economy is the price of cocoa. Under the Structural Adjustment Program, declining export
prices for cocoa have not been fully transmitted to the farmer. Instead, each year the



- 56 -
producer price has been set so as to increase the historically low farmer's share of cocoa
revenues; correspondingly, the operating costs of COCOBOD have been reduced and, in more
recent years, fax revenues from cocoa have declined. These improved incentives have led to
increased cocoa production and farmer incomes.
70.   Reform of state-owned enterprises has been an important part of the Structural
Adjustment Program, and has two components. First, certain measures have been taken to
improve the efficiency, accountability, and profitability of the small group of enterprises that
are expected to remain in the public sector. With regard to most enterprises in this group
accounts are being brought up to date and audited, corporate plans have been drawn up and
performance agreements have been signed. Secondly, the process of privatizing or liquidating
the bulk of SOEs has recently accelerated following the separation of the DIC from the SEC.
71.   There are four parts to the civil service reform program. First, the pay and grading
systems are being reformed. Secondly, the personnel management and payroll systems are
being integrated. Third, staffing is being reduced, and finally staff training and development
is to become more systematic. In all these areas significant progress has made but much
remains to be done.
72.   So far, improvements in public expenditure management have focussed particularly on
estimation and planning of recurrent and capital expenditures. This will continue, with steady
progress likely in the timeliness and realism of annual budget preparations, and the
maintenance of the rolling three-year public investment program. Increased emphasis will be
placed on incorporating sector strategies into the budget process, which will allow, inter alia,
a more explicit poverty focus to be given to public expenditure programming. This will
complement the poverty alleviation measures taken under PAMSCAD and other programs,
particularly in the health, agriculture and education sectors.
73.   To facilitate private sector development, several major tax reform initiatives have been
taken in recent years; taxes on profits, personal income, capital gains and sales have all been
reduced and several double taxation agreements have been concluded. At the same time,
foreign investment approval procedures have been streamlined and certain aspects of the
regulatory framework have been revised to be more in keeping with a market-oriented
economy.

-Comments Received from KfW on the Draft PPAR
Re: Ghana, First and Second Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs)
Draft Program Performance Audit Report (.your letter of 03-05-4992)
Dear Mr. Baird,
following are our comments on your draft report concerning the two SAPs.
We appreciate your effort to neutrally evaluate the elaboration and
implementation of the SAPs. We fully concur with many of your statements,
e.g. those on the close relation with other Worldbank programs and
credits, the slow response of the private sector, on the difficulties
concerning the state-owned enterprises (page 33 ff) or the reform of the
cocoa sector (page 35 ff). On the other hand, we would like to mention
some other aspects of your draft report on Ghana or on Worldbank's SAP
activities in general which could still be improved.
1. We are not sure whether the objectives of the SAPs mentioned by you
(pages XI and 4), e.g. the strengthening of savings, investments, and the
balance of payments, or trade liberalization, are really the objectives -
or not the technical measures of the SAPs. Economic terms are not
objectives themselves, but have to benefit the population and to be
formulated in relation to it.
2. Eventually internal economic policy factors have been overestimated
and external factors underestimated in your report. This refers not only
to the world market prices of cocoa (which, indeed, are mentioned several
times), but also to the world oil prices, the terms of trade, the very
high debt service of Ghana (40 to 60 percent of export earnings!), the
slow structural adjustment in these and other aspects by the world
economy, the weather conditions etc. These factors, deficits in these
areas and their impact on the economic development of Ghana should be
dealt with in the same detail as has been done for domestic economic
policy deficits. E.g. what could be done to avoid the impact of a 30
percent drop of governments revenues caused by the fall of cocoa export
prices?
3. Taking ag-iculture, not only exports (cocoa) are important, but also
imports and their influence on domestic food production, which normally
is more closely related to the welfare of the population than are
exports. What about the influence of cereal and meat imports (which are
heavily subsidized by the industrialized countries) on the Ghanaian
efforts tc raise food production and self-sufficiency? What is the
optimal extent of import liberalization or of effective protection? An
import duty of 25 (10) percent (page 8, 11), is it really sufficient if
prices of major imports are effected by dumping?

4.  Privatization is a major feature of the two.SAPs. While this is
justified, we think, similar importance should be given to the
establishment of-a governmental competition policy in all Its different
aspects, in order to avoid monopolies, oligopolies, cartels etc. This
aspect is mentioned only once in your report (page 9). What are the
effects on the population if a public monopoly is just substituted by a
private one?
5. We have some doubts whether the result of the SAPs can really be
measured in macroeconomic aggregates (pages XVII and 21 ff), especially
becasue of the importance of the external factors mentlioned. You, too,
express the possibility of the improvement of these aggregates being the
result of the substantial foreign exchange assistance associated with the
SAPs (page 21). Also the steep developments of export prices or of the
terms of trade in a given year may be more important than domestic policy
changes.
6. We think it is not sufficient that there are extensive consultations
between your bank and the government in elaborating and implementing the
SAPs (pages XIX, 24). In the interest of the Ghanaian people it would be
better to include also the private sector and other representatives of
the population (e.g. local NGOs) in all major discussions (especially if
there have not been elections since years) (vide also your
recommendations, pages XXI and 12).
7. We are not so sure that the staff input in your supervision missions
should still be increased (pages XXII     54), given the facts that the
input in this case has already been 36 and 100 percent, respectively,
higher than in other cases (page 32) and that the ownership of the
programs was clearly with the government of Ghana.
We trust that you will understand the sense of our points (in spite of
their brief formulation) and take them into account in your final report.
Yours faithfully

!  Cbmmnts on the Project Criupletion Report           Page 2 of 4
of the Structural AdjuLstrnt Programme in Ghana m
When evaluating effects of structural adjustment programnes, it is always
important snd valuable to clarifv the existing constraints which hindered the
smooth impl emcntatioon of the prograuites as well as the component of the programme
itself; i.e. whether it has brought about favourable impacts as expected. Ghana's
case, however, is said to be one of few sueeessful cases of structural adjustment
programmes in Sub-Saharan Africa. where, im most areas. the economies are
seriousiv recessed. The main reason of their success is being attributed to the
strong commitment by the Ghanaian government to the implementation of thc
adjustment progranmes. Consequently, it seems clear that clarifying the reason
ard analysing the factors which have led to the success in Ghana would be useful.
providing meaningful implication to the future prospects of the programmes in
other Sub-saharan African countries.
Subsequently, we would like to learn from this PPAR
(1)learning lessons from the experience in Ghana for further improvement.
(2)analysing and generalising, as much as possible, the factors which led to the
remarkable economic performance in Ghana, in order to apply their valuable
experience to other developing countries.
Of these purposes, we would like to emphasise the latter, therefore, we recognise
that it shall be very useful if you could elaborate slightly more on the following
issues concerning the successful implementation of the structural adjustment
progyrfves in Ghana.
1. Ghane's strong coamitment to SAP.  Political Governance and Tmplementation.
As stated above, the strong commitment was observed bv the government when
implcmepting the SAP in Gbana. Indeed, it was one of the most important clmoents
which allowed the substantial aid inflow to Ghana and also the remarkable ceonomic
performance.
In this sense, strong government seems to be a key when SAPs are in progress.
However, at the same time, SAP is a programme which aims to achieve a
reorientation of the political envirornment directing a free. or market-friendlv
economy, favouring greater efficiency In the use of resources within the public
sector and enhanced role for the private sector. Therefore, the programme include
measures which reduces the degree of goverrnment intervention. On the other hand,
smcoth and satisfactory implewetatton of SAP requires a strong government simply



- 89 -                          Attachment 2
Page 3 of 4
because SA.P measuros quiite often force both public and private sectors bear "'hard
life". Possible resistance from these sectors needs to be controlled by tho
government. preferably before it comes out to the surface, for the successful
achievement of conditionality which finally allows consessional money from donors.
Appearently. this contradictorv problem, i.e., reduction of intervention and
taking stronger initiative by the government, is now being well controlled in
Ghana, where, too, demeoratisation is taking place. Is there no opposition seen
in Ghana against the SAP? If yes. how are they suppressed? Analysing how the
Ghanaian government have managed these matters since the introduction of the SAP
as well as the democratisation movement. would greatly contribute to the smootier
Implementation of the programmes in other countries.
2. Coordination of interest groups during the SAP.
Generally, structural adjustment programmes depoliticize the economic system:
foreign exchange system by introducing an auction system: trade system by
abolishing the licencing system. During this process, conflicts among different
interest groups can easily be expected to arise. However, from the PPAR, it
appears that Ghana has hardly observed such disputes so far. Was there any
particular consideration existed for the acquired rights? Has not any rent-
seeking activity taken place in Ghana?
It would be very useful if the way how the Ghanaian government has controlled
these possible conflicts among different interests can be elaborated in the PPAR.
3. Pace of the SAP - Gradualism -
The appropriate pace of the SAP has always been the main issues in its
implementation. In Ghana. the measures have been implemented gradually rather
than quickly; it has been about a decade since the ERP in 1983, now. Is there anv
correlation between the pace of implementation and the effects/impacts of the
SAP? To which extent does the price of implementation infltw"ne the results of the
SAP? Clearly, the "gradualism' worked in Ghana, but why? Can it be applied in
which country and cannot be in which country? Or, is it universal?
The research focussing on the pace of the implementation would also have a deep
implication to the political aspects of the SAP mentioned above.



Attachment 2
Page 4 of 4
The macroeconomic performance! achieved in Ghana since 1983 has been
impressive.  boreover. Ghana has expressed their willirngess to mitigate various
social costs of adjustment, hence became one of the first countries who
introduncd the special programe for this purpose - PA%SCAD. After all these
improvancnts, we quite agree that nnw Ghana has reached the stage at which private
sector activities should he encouraged while efficiency of the public seetor
should be promoted. In order to have a further economic development in Ghana,
there are, of course, a nmuber of lessons to be learned and wetters to be improved
(e.g. adequate institution building). However, taking into account of the
significant economic performance made in this recent decade, there are also many
to be applied from the experience In Ghana, to other developing countries in a
process of structural adjustment, which can he diseussed in the PPAR.

Comments Received from Sweden on the Draft PPAR
Mr. Mark Baird
Division Chief
The World Bank
Dear Mr. Baird, -
Re: Ghana - First and.Second Structural Adjustment
CreAits. Draft PrograTn PerfLormance Audit R
In referance to your letter of 5 March 1992 where
you request comments on the draft Program
Performance Audit Report (PPAR) on the First and
Second Structural Adjustment Credit for Ghana I
hereby forward the Swedish considerations on the
report, compiled by the Swedish Embassy in Lagos.
The Economic Recovery Program (ERP) and the
structural adjustment program of Ghana have served
as models in regard to the economic development
they have resulted in. It has hereby been showed
that strictly implemented reform programmes can
give positive effects in form of continuous
economic growth. The draft Programme Performance
Audit Report confirms this, but some additional
conments will here be presented.
It is obvious that the economic growth in Ghana to
a large extent is due to the massive international
development assistance given. It would be
interesting to see, both in the adjustment program



Attachment 3
Pago 2 of 2
and in the PPAR, an intensified discussion on
possible strategies for Ghana to in the long term
perspective move away from this aid-dependence.
Regarding export, the adjustment program is
focusing on cacao'. VeLy little is said about
possible incentives to promote alternative
export-products.
Could the primary product cacao bee refined
locally ?
In the Program Completion Report, p. 9, the COCOBOD
is briefly menti6nad. What role should the board
play in a market oriented economy ?
Reforminq the banking and financial sector is
Important. Has any strategy been elaborated i.a.
"prudential guidelines" for the banks on how to
avoid lending to non-productive activities ?
An important component in the adjustment program is
the Management of Public Sector Resourses including
the Civil Service Reform. The low level of civil
servants salaries causes a   brain drain". The
reforms that were undertaken in the 80's failed to
increase the salary differentials. What could have
and can be done in order to adjust the public
sector salaries ?
We look forward to receiving the final version of
this very interesting and useful report.

Dear Mr. Sairc',
Draft Prograitme Performance Audit Reports on Structural Adjustment
Credlts for Gfiana
Thank you vers much for having transmitted to me your evaluation report
on the World Bank's structural adjustment loans to Ghana, and for
sharlng wlth us your assessment of these loans. The report makes
extremely Int!?resting reaching and comes at a time where It seems very
Important to think about the future pollcy strategy In Ghana.
In what folijws, I will first make some general remarks on the
adjustment process In Ghana and then comment on some more specific
issues. Unfo,-tunately, for reasons of staff changes, the Dlrectorate's
General Struc;tural Adjustment Unit was not able to put forward detailed
technical corn nents. The remarks which follow may therefore appear
somewhat genc!ral. Unfortunately, they also come a bit late. I
nevertheless hope that you will find them of some use.
Let me first of all reconfirm the Commission's baslc agreement with the
need for a thi:rough adjustment policy In Ghana. Given the situatlon of
the country at the beginning of the 1980's there was Indeed no
aiternative t,: such   a strategy Including as Its major elements the
adoption and nalntenance of a reallstic exchange rate, monetary and
fiscal dlsclp,'lne, trade llberalIsat/on and the ratlonalIsatlon of the
tariff and taJi system (Including any kind of export taxatlon), as well
as a reform of the public sector and the management of public
resources.
This programm! has undoubtedly been highly successful . A number of
measures have 3een thoroughly Implemented, and In particular the reform
of the forelgr exchange market (which was the main precondltlon for the
subsequent gro:wth in exports), Ilberallsatlon and ratlonallsatlon of
the trading svitem, and the adoption of monetary and fiscal discipline
(these elementv overlap of course wlth-the first stabilisatlon phase).

programme, le. the extraordinary commitment of the Government of Ghana
to It. To some extent, this certainly was the result of the very
careful preps,ation of SAC I on your past, which gave all the partles
concerned the, opportunity to express their polnts of view, and which
gave you the opportunity, In the design of the programme, to take Into
account the svecial circumstances of the Individual case.
At the same time, a -stylized' sequence of the events which have taken
place In Ghana until now could be descrlbed as consisting of the
three phases stabillsatlon, rehabilltation and "real' structural
change, wheri: the latter would Include, Inter alla, productivity
increases In agricultural smalIholder production, establIshment of
competitive smtall and medium scale Industrles, the development of non-
traditional ecports etc.    It would then seem that most of what has
happened in Glhana until now fell under the first two headings bullding
on existing p,oduction capacity. Glven that this capacity now seems to
be largely vxhausted - or Is no longer competitive under new
circumstances - growth In the future will to a much larger extent have
to rely on st:'uctural change than It did In the past.
It Is in thi! context that the relatively low leve/ of savings and
Investment, e,od In particular the low level of private savings and
Investment (o0,tside the mining sector) Is all the more worrying. This
fact Is of coijrse discussed In detall In your evaluation report, and Is
also mentionedl In the Programme Completlon Report. The lag In the
response of te private sector Is certalnly the most disturbing factor
in Ghana's economic development.
It may be duwt to a lack of confidence on the part of the private
Investors, because of uncertainty about the Governments attitude to
private econonic activity.    It may also be due to the absence of a
traditlon of a market economy In Ghana (not only for the last thirty
years). However, It should a-lso be taken Into accoun't that for a
country like Ghana wlth a very low per capita Income and an economy
which Is only partlY monetarily Integrated, the terms market economy,
private sector, and also structural adjustment mean something totally
dlfferent than for a country wlth a per capita Income     of 4ay 2000 US
S. Applying `he same reform package for different types of countries
could then eaeoly be perceived as "dogmatic".
It is therefo,'e my view that the general weakness and fragillty of a
.modern' prlveAe sector, a sector which In fact In a dountry like Ghana
cannot be take, as given, but Is just In the process of being created,
as   well   as  the   general  deficiencies    In  basic   economic   and
-institutional 'nfrastructure, must have consequences for the design of
an adjustment ::trategy.
This concerns in particular
-  a realistl: time-frame for the adjustment process      Including the
provision ci external financing . While It might be polntless to

give bala,,ce of payments support to a country which continue to
build up 1Oreign exchange-,reserves, one should at the same time not
allow the growth process to slow down because of lack of external
financing luring a phase where reform measures are supposed to show
lasting reaults;
-  a graduall:,t Instead of a shock approach to reform measures;
16           -  the need for 'positive' measures which go beyond financial reform
and moblli,atlon of resources to support the process of resource-
switching which apparently does not happen automatically;
- a very car9ful consideratlon of the social costs of adjustment, In
particular as regards the Impact on employment, as the private
sector ag,arently creates much less new employment than was
expected.
At the same time, one should resist the temptation to create an
"artificial' boom durlng a phase where the basic structures for
sustalnable growth still have to be laid.
It Is agains' this background that I would agree with some of the
quallfication! you make In your evaluat/on report. This Includes your
comments with regard to the divestiture exercise, where difficulties
seem to have .aeen underestimated concerning the constraints of private
Investment an,' the avallabillty of private finance.
It also Incliudes your remarks as regards the financlal and soclal
consequences )f retrenchment programmes (the necessity of which can
however not b- questloned) and of restructurlng In general. Glven the
lower than ex,)ected creatlon of new employment by private Investment,
the 'traditiotial rural economy' had to absorb part of the unemployed.
As wlth the o, going commerciallsatIon of the rural economy this will be
less and les; possible In the future, the soclal consequence of
restructuring measures will have to be thought of very carefully, and
will In the future have to be accompanled by the creation of some kind
of 'socIal In'rastructure.
It would alsc seem to be Important to be very careful wlth regard to
the effects o;' ilberallsation on the domestic Industrlal sector, and In
particular sxaul   and medlum-sized enterprises.    This Is one of the
sectors  whern -Lt Is Important to support adjustment by, "positive"
measures, whl:'h should however not take the form of direct financlal
support.-but -should rather Include technical assistance In..management
training, marr.eting, technological Information and similar measures.
This Is of c,:urse an Issue which Is belng adressed In projects and
programmes whi'^h the World Bank and other donors are about to prepare.
It Is therefc-e my vlew that while a lot has been achleved at the
-macroeconomic level, even more remalns to be done at the sectoral
level, In orde:r to further deepen the adjustment process. However, 'it
would also be an error not to be aware of the Instabilltles.of the
economy which still exist at the macroeconomic level. The.country's
balance of payi,ents positlon still very much depends on the prices of a
few export (trd Import) commodities. While Inflation seems to have
been brought itnder control for the time belng, this might easily be
reversed   due   In  particutar   to   Internal  supply   rigidities   In



Attachment 4
-96 -                                Page 4 of 5
agriculture, wyhich still very much depends on climatic conditlons, and
which until 70W has barely been touched by adjustment (except for
cocoa). At Cie same time, if-would seem to be extremely Important to
keep inflatt:'n under control, so that nominal and real rates of
interest can be further lowered, which seems to be another vital factor
for domestic nvestment incentIves.
As regards tre sectoral level, one of the problems which worries us
most Is the questlon of pub/ic finance, and in particular public
expenditure i,anagement.   In your  report,  this area might not have
received the itttention It deserves. It Is our Impression, from what we
learned during' our participation in the last Public Expenditure Revlew,
that the whole process of budgetary planning, Implementation, and
control,   is   still   very   weak   and   characterized   by   enormous
admlnlstrativ! and organisatlonal difficultles. This includes, among
others, the glow of Information between the ministry of finance, the
llne ministrivs, and the regional and local administratlon, durlng all
phases of the budget process.
Therefore, In order to make the budget an effectIve Instrument of
polIcy Impledientatlon, In particular on the sectoral level, much
remalns to be done to improve the budget process, and pollcy reform in
this area Is tar from belng successfully Implemented.
Given the Imp.rtance of this area for the implementatlon of programmes
and projects In general, the Commission Is very Interested In
continulng Itu; Participation in the PER exercise and also to make a
more Intenslvi. and technical contribution to It.
Flnally, I shu1uld like to make two remarks as regards the question of
Implementation and methodology of evaluation.
Firstly I share your vlews about the problems of project - or programme
- specific Invtitutional Infrastructure. Agaln and agaln It has become
clear from ou, own evaluations that while such Infrastructure makes It
easler to start a project, later on It may create major problems as
regards the cnvnershIp and the sustainabillty of the project.      It Is
therefore our view that one should Insist, from the very beginning,
that proJects and programmes are Implemented by existing Institutlons,
and that these! institutions should be strengthened, Instead of creating
new and project-specif ic Institutions.
Finally, a word about the methodology of determining the Impact of an
adjustment prcgramme.
An evaluation report which Is primarily meant to serve operational
purposes Is ce.rtainly not the place to discuss evaluation methodology.
However, In tile present case the questlon of methodology Is closely
ltnked to the 7uestion of how to Isolate the effects of policy changes
_on growth ano other varlables.     While this may be a very difficult
exercise, It would nevertheless have been Interesting to rtave some vlew
on it.   It Is true that the level of aid per capita for Ghana Is
comparable to some other SSA countries which did not do as well as
Ghana (an arg,,ment also made In last year's 'Progress on Adjustment'
Report). The mportant question however Is what would have happened In
Ghana, without the huge aid Inflows of the past, and what will happen



Attachment 4
97 -                              Page 5 of 5
In the future when these Inflows are longer available at the same level
and quality.   In fact,   given the macroeconomic    Instabillties still
remaining anc' the need for further deepening the adjustment process on
the sectoral level, one should be very flexible in considering further
needs for bal.2nce of payments support.
In concludinc, I Should like to thank you again for having transmitted
the evaluaticn report to us.     I am all the more sorry that for the
reasons  I me'rtioned above we were unable to produce more detalled
t        comments, anui could only touch some baslc aspects of the adjustment
process In Gt,na, as we see It.
/ hope that although my remarks come rather late, they will still be of
some interest to you.
Yours sincere'y,
