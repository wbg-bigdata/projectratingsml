0.1. Introduction

The project evaluated in this Implementation Completion and Results report (ICR) is one of
twenty-nine projects funded by the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF), which are all part of a much
larger programmatic approach to support Nile cooperation. Because of the complementary and
strategic nature of the projects, it would be incomplete to either evaluate the individual projects
in isolation of the overall programmatic framework or fail to look at the role each NBTF project
played in building Nile cooperation. This preface provides an overview of the coordinated
partner support to the Nile countries through and in coordination with the NBTF, to provide
background and context for the individual project ICR that follows.
The NBTF was created to support a trend of increasing cooperation in the Nile region. In 1995,
the Nile governments established the Nile Council of Ministers of Water Resources (Nile-COM)
and designed the Nile River Basin Action Plan, identifying 22 technical assistance projects
which aimed to address economic development and equitable use of the Nile waters. In 1999,
the Nile-COM adopted a long-term Shared Vision: to achieve sustainable socio-economic
development through equitable utilization of and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water
resources. More specifically, Nile Ministers adopted policy guidelines, “to develop the water
resources of the Nile Basin in a sustainable and equitable way to ensure prosperity, security and
peace for all its people; to ensure efficient water management and the optimal use of the
resources; to ensure cooperation and joint action between the Nile Basin countries; to target
poverty eradication and promote economic integration; and to ensure that the program results in
a move from planning to action.?
                                    In order to advance these policy guidelines, the Nile-COM
       Shared Vision                endorsed cooperation built around a Strategic Action Program
                                    with two complementary concepts: the need to enable a
         Shared
                                    common basis to achieve the Shared Vision for the Nile Basin
         Vision
                                    and the need to advance projects that benefited “the people and
       Program
                                    particularly the poor and disadvantaged in the Nile Basin.? As
                    Subsidiary      a result, Nile-COM endorsed two programs: the Shared Vision
                      Action        Program (SVP) and the Subsidiary Action Program (see Figure
                     Program        1). First, the Shared Vision Program was designed to build
    Action on the Ground            trust, confidence, and an enabling environment for the
                                    sustainable and equitable use of the Nile resources among
Figure 1: Complementary Design of   water professionals and the public. Second, as articulated by
Early Nile Programs                 Nile-COM, “a shared vision can only be legitimized by action
                                    on the ground,? the Subsidiary Action Program (SAP), one for
the Eastern Nile and one for the Equatorial Lakes, which focused on investment projects that
addressed agricultural needs, environmental risks, energy, and river management. To implement
these programs, the following year the Nile-COM ministers agreed to establish the Nile Basin
Initiative (NBI) as a transitional institutional arrangement. At establishment, NBI’s member
states were Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda,
Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda with Eritrea holding observer status. Membership is now ten
countries with South Sudan joining in July 2012.
                                                 1
In 2001, the Nile Basin governments and international development partners convened for the
International Consortium for Cooperation on the Nile (ICCON) in Geneva to discuss the Nile
Shared Vision and the proposed programs, pledging US$140 million for their implementation.
Based on the interest expressed by the Nile-COM and partners at ICCON, a multi-donor funding
mechanism, the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF), was established at the World Bank in 2003 with
a consortium of ten international donors1 to support the countries in their pursuit of the Shared
Vision. Several donors also supported the NBI directly in coordination with the NBTF. With
this considerable partnership, overall financial support to NBI has far exceeded the ICCON
pledges.

Over the ten years, the NBTF supported twenty-
eight completed NBI projects as part of the
Shared Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs,
and an Institutional Strengthening Project. The
last set of projects closed at the end of 2012
(Table 1). To enable full disbursement of NBTF
funds in support of NBI, partners to the NBTF
agreed a two year extension of the fund until
June 2015. An additional project, the Nile                                                                  Eastern Nile

The NBTF supported the Nile countries to
establish the NBI as a transitional institutional mechanism. The NBI is the only regional
water organization for all Nile Basin countries, aiming to operate as a catalyst for integrated
growth, investment and risk management to achieve the Shared Vision. To carry out the Shared
Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs, the three NBI Centers were formed; the NBI Secretariat
in Entebbe, Uganda and two Subsidiary Action Program offices, the Eastern Nile Technical
Regional Office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action
Program – Coordination Unit in Kigali, Rwanda (Figure 2).

The governance structure is aligned with the basin-wide/sub-basin structure of the Nile Basin
Initiative, (Figure 3). A Nile Council of Ministers and a Technical Advisory Committee (Nile-
TAC) guides the basin-wide work of the NBI Secretariat (Nile-SEC). At the level of the Eastern
Nile sub-basin, an Eastern Nile Council of Ministers (EN-COM) and an Eastern Nile Strategic

the development partnership and support efforts to increase Nile cooperation outside but in coordination with the
NBTF partnership.

Equatorial Lakes sub-basin, the Nile Equatorial Lakes Council of Ministers (NEL-COM) and the
Nile Equatorial Lakes Technical Advisory Committee (NEL-TAC) provide governance services.

Through the ten projects under the Shared Vision Program (SVP), the NBI has improved
collaboration within the Basin. The US$87 million Shared Vision Program was designed to
build trust, strengthen capacity, and advance the enabling environment for investment in the Nile
Basin. The program created networks and partnerships that brought people together across the
Basin countries in various water-related sectors. According to a 2008 opinion poll, 2the program
created measurably greater levels of trust among such stakeholder categories as lawyers, media
professionals and women leaders. Through work on joint projects on a range of critical issues,
the SVP advanced a shared understanding of the need for regional engagement between the
countries, including in water resource management, environment, wetlands, and regional power
trade. The projects yielded a more organized knowledge base, a Decision Support System (DSS)
and other tools to better understand, model and analyze the basin, an inventory of wetlands, plans
for watershed management and regional power generation and transmission, studies of
agricultural productivity and opportunities for water savings, and trained over 2,000
professionals.

The Shared Vision Program provided platforms to bring country officials together at the policy
and the technical level. Based on these platforms, technical cooperation was strengthened
thereby helping basin-wide processes and practices to be shared and consolidated. By
establishing and managing a shared institution, and by collaborating on development projects
and risk-management strategies, the Nile Basin countries established common principles, without
which long-term cooperation would be difficult. Various project teams are in continuing contact
across countries, through other NBI projects, or other initiatives. The NBI is also establishing an
integrated policy environment, including a suite of policies called the Nile Basin Sustainability
Framework.

The NBI centers have improved the collation, analysis, and access to information relating to the
Nile basin, including a procedures and norms for date and information sharing and exchange.
The NBI has helped foster greater exchange not only on the river itself but on energy, agriculture
and trade opportunities. NBI is a platform that can be used as a mechanism to notify each other
of certain planned development projects using Nile waters.
Given its programmatic nature, the Shared Vision Program was reviewed by the World Bank in a
Programmatic Implementation Completion and Results Report in June 20103. The report
reviewed the achievements of the seven thematic projects as well as the umbrella coordination
project (Table 1). The Programmatic ICR found that the Outcomes, Bank performance and
Grantee Performance were all moderately satisfactory, with the risk to development outcomes
being rated as substantial.

While the outputs of many of the SVP projects were mainstreamed into other on-going initiatives,
two SVP projects implemented second phases; the Regional Power Trade Project which
produced a Comprehensive Basin-wide Study of Power Development Options and Trade
Opportunities: Proposed Development Options, Strategies and Investment Arrangements; and
the Water Resources Planning and Management Project extended the closing date until
December 31, 2012 to complete the Nile Basin Decision Support System - this second phase of
support has been reviewed in a new ICR.4
The Subsidiary Action Program helped identify and prepare investments of transboundary
significance to improve the livelihoods of the basin’s neediest populations and promote
sustainable growth through improved watershed management, flood preparedness, agricultural
improvement, power generation, and transmission. It also helped facilitate agreement among
countries to move some investments forward – such as the regional Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric
Project that is expected to make a significant contribution to access to power in Burundi, Rwanda,
and Tanzania. The NBI facilitated US$919 million of investment projects currently under
implementation, with a further US$1.584 billion under preparation (Table 2).

In addition, Subsidiary Action Program has helped the countries to consolidate their knowledge
of the sub-basins and develop new tools and applications to help better identify and plan
investments of regional significance. ENTRO and NELSAP-CU have provided studies and
analysis to their member governments to improve planning and implementation of regional
sustainable development projects. The NBI issues regional flood bulletins with hydrological
forecasts for the Eastern Nile to assist national, regional and community authorities in predicting
floods. University networks, especially in the Eastern Nile, have been strengthened through
collaborative studies, internship programs, and workshops.

started in 2008 and closed in December 2012. Through ISP, the NBI clarified its core functions
developed a five year Strategic Plan and a Financing Strategy to advance its sustainability. As a
result of this work, the Nile governments committed to incrementally increase their direct
financial contributions to the NBI to cover the core costs of the institution by 2017 (FY2018).

The NBI has also developed a suite of Strategic Plans for each Center and a consolidated concept
note of projects for 2013 – 2017 which was presented to development partners in November
2011. The overarching Strategic Plan, (Figure 4) shows how the NBI’s current work expands its
original programmatic structure including the Shared Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs.
As part of implementing the new Strategic Plan and building on other projects, the NBI prepared
the Nile Cooperation for Results (NCORE) Project. This project is supporting NBI activities in
its three core functions of facilitating cooperation, water resource management, and water
resource development.
The support provided through the ISP enabled results to be achieved across the NBI, including
the twenty-one other SVP and SAP projects that were undertaken by the NBI during ISP
implementation, as well as the subsequent work that was enabled by the ISP project. While a
stand-alone ICR for the ISP project has been produced7, the breadth of the ISP results can only
truly be assessed when looking at the successes and lessons of the other NBI efforts as well.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Regional and sectoral context
The Nile River is a major regional resource and global asset. It is the world’s longest river,
traveling more than 6,700 kilometers from its farthest source at the headwaters of the Kagera
Basin in Rwanda and Burundi to its delta in Egypt on the Mediterranean Sea. The river is shared
by eleven countries8: Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya,
Rwanda, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. The basin covers 3 million square
kilometers – one tenth of Africa’s land mass. For millennia the Nile River has played a central
role in human settlement and in the development of a rich diversity of cultures and livelihoods.
The basin includes world class environmental assets, notably Lake Victoria, the second largest
freshwater body in the world, and the vast wetlands of the Sudd, roughly the size of Belgium.
Today, the basin is home to an estimated 238 million people, and more than 400 million people
live in the eleven countries that share and depend on Nile waters. This population is expected to
increase to 648 million by 2030. All of these people rely, to a greater or lesser extent, on the
waters of the Nile for their basic needs and economic growth.

Development challenges are considerable with the countries of the Nile basin characterized by
extreme poverty. The low GDP per capita in eight of the basin’s countries9 rank them among the
poorest countries in the world. Food insecurity plagues the region, due in part to high rates of
inter- and intra-annual rainfall variability and inadequate infrastructure to store water and regulate
stream flows for productive uses. Water-related shocks (e.g., droughts, floods) have had
considerable impact on lives and economies in the region, and climate change is likely to
exacerbate these negative impacts. Unsustainable environmental conditions, evidenced for
example by high rates of soil erosion, characterize much of the human settlement of the region.
Only a small percentage of the population has access to basic water and sanitation services and
electric power – and even this power is unreliable. There is a history of tensions and instability in
the region, both between states and internal to states. Increasing population and consequent
pressure on resources are expected to worsen this situation.

The Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) was established by nine Nile riparian states10 in 1999 as a
regional partnership to develop the river in a cooperative manner, share socio-economic benefits,
and promote regional peace and security. Its mission statement is “to achieve sustainable socio-
economic development through equitable utilization of, and benefit from, the common Nile basin
water resources.?11 The NBI is led by the Nile Council of Ministers of Water (NileCOM)
comprising the ministers of water affairs from each member state. They are advised by the Nile
Technical Advisory Committee (NileTAC) comprising two technical representatives from each
member states. The NBI includes the Nile Basin Secretariat (NileSEC) in Uganda, the Eastern
Nile Technical Regional Office (ENTRO) in Ethiopia, the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary
Action Program Coordination Unit (NELSAP-CU) in Rwanda, and national NBI offices in each

  At the start of the project, there were ten riparians. In July 2011, the Republic of South Sudan was
established as an independent state from the Sudan, forming the eleventh riparian.

   At establishment there were nine NBI member states: Burundi, DR Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya,
Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. Now there are ten members, with South Sudan joining in July 2012.

‘Centers’.

To transform the NBI vision into action, the NBI developed two complementary sets of
programs: the Shared Vision Program (SVP) and the Subsidiary Action Programs (SAPs). The
SVP, a US$100 million grant-funded program launched in 2003 and completed in 2012, was a
multi-country, multi-sectoral program of collaborative action, exchange of experience, and trust
and capacity building designed to build a strong foundation for regional cooperation. The SVP
included seven thematic projects focusing on water resources, environment, power trade,
agriculture, applied training, communications and stakeholder involvement. An eighth project
provided for coordination of the SVP. In parallel, to yield tangible benefits, two SAPs were set
up – one in the Eastern Nile (the Eastern Nile Subsidiary Action Program, ENSAP), and the other
in the Nile Equatorial Lakes (the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action Program, NELSAP).
The SAPs had an initial set of agreed investment projects within the NBI framework (estimated
US$700 million). Under the SAPs, institutional strengthening and capacity building was also
provided to the two implementing institutions. In the Eastern Nile region, projects have focused
on power trade, watershed management, irrigation and drainage, and flood preparedness. In the
Equatorial Lakes region projects have focused on natural resource management and hydropower
development.

In mid-2005, NileCOM recognized the need to strengthen the NBI and to plan for a future
permanent institution. This started a participatory process led by NBI with the member countries
to design an institutional strengthening project to be funded by the Nile Basin Trust Fund. The
project design was finally approved by NileCOM in July 2008 and the project commenced in
October 2008.

Rationale for Bank’s assistance
Initiated by a request from the NileCOM in 1997, the riparian countries sought Bank involvement
in the Nile Basin. As a result, the Bank has been NBI’s leading partner, administering the Nile
Basin Trust Fund (NBTF) on behalf of development partners, promoting investment projects and
supporting the Nile Basin institutions through supervision and technical assistance. This long
involvement and the Bank’s broad experience constituted compelling reasons for continued Bank
involvement in the Institutional Strengthening Project, enabling the gains from NBTF project
support over the previous years to be further sustained.

The Bank also had unique capacity to support the complex political, institutional and economic
processes involved in working towards a strengthened management framework for the basin. The
Bank also had a successful record of managing donor partnerships including multi-donor trust
funds and, therefore, had the capacity to mobilize donor support required to facilitate regional
projects. More than seventeen partners support the NBI through technical and financial support,
largely through the NBTF. These development partners have consistently welcomed Bank
leadership and convene bi-annually for NBTF committee meetings.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The Project Development Objective of the Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP) was ‘the Nile
Basin Initiative has strengthened foundation for institutional sustainability, enhanced capacity,
and harmonized corporate management to more effectively deliver programs and projects ’.

The key indicators were:
   1. Strategy for institutional and financial sustainability presented to the Nile Council of
       Ministries (NileCOM)
   2. Strategy developed to mainstream critical Shared Vision Program (SVP) outputs and
       functions into NBI operations and implementation started
   3. Harmonized corporate management systems in place, including financial management,
       procurement and human resources.
   4. Investment projects with trans-boundary relevance are able to attract international
       financing.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
There were no revisions to the PDO during project implementation; however, the key indicators
were revised as part of the Mid-Term Review (MTR) exercise from December 2010 to April
2011 to make them more specific and include measureable annual targets. These revisions were
formalized when the project was restructured in March 2012.

The revised key indicators were:
   1. Core functions endorsed by governors
   2. Strategy for institutional and financial sustainability ready for presentation to governance
   3. Water Resources Management and Planning function operational
   4. Trans-boundary investment projects attract financing
   5. % of core staff costs covered by non-ISP sources

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) does not explicitly specify the main beneficiaries. The
project was focused on the NBI itself which directly benefited from institutional strengthening.
By association, other beneficiaries were the governing bodies of the NBI (NileCOM and
NileTAC) as representatives of the NBI’s riparian countries who gained a stronger regional
institution.

The indirect and ultimate beneficiaries of the project are the basin populations who are gaining
from strengthened cooperative water resources management and development promoted through
a strengthened NBI. Results already include improved watershed management for communities
living in degraded areas of the basin, flood preparedness and early warning through regional
forecasting rainfall and prediction of potential areas of inundation which are communicated to
national agencies and on to communities, and in the future will include increased food security
through expanded irrigation and greater regional trade, increased access to a reliable electricity
supply, and broadly increased inward investment to the region to support poverty reduction and
economic growth.

1.5 Original Components
The ISP comprised of five components implemented across the NBI, based on a common context,
simple principles of institutional effectiveness, and widely-acknowledged attributes of good
integrated river basin management.


                                                                                                11
The five components were:
    1.   Strengthening and harmonizing NBI corporate management and governance (US$8.57m)
    2.   Enhancing the foundation for knowledge-based water resource management (US$2.37m)
    3.   Enhancing the foundation for water resource development (US$3.37m)
    4.   Strengthening stakeholder participation and communication (US$3.77m)
    5.   Management of Shared Vision Program projects (US$2.90m)
         Unallocated funding (US$3.03m)
         Total US$24.02m

1.6 Revised Components
As a result of the Mid-Term Review and subsequently formalized by project restructuring, the
components were amended to directly align with the three core functions of NBI and a fourth
function covering corporate issues. Accordingly the activities and their respective budgets were
reorganized to fit within the relevant components. The revised five components then directly
related to the five revised results framework outcomes.

The revised five components were:
       1. NBI has improved capacity to facilitate cooperation (US$10.60m)
       2. NBI knowledge-based water resource management function strengthened (US$2.02m)
       3. NBI water resource development function strengthened (US$3.01m)
       4. NBI has the corporate capacity to deliver its core functions (US$5.38m)
       5. Management of Shared Vision Program projects (US$3.01m)
          Total US$24.02m

The primary changes were within components 1 and 4. Component 1 originally covered
governance and capacity building, including corporate services. It was considered to contain too
many elements,and was revised to focus on cooperation and included strengthening the secretariat
function to TAC & COM, NBIs institutional arrangements, and external relations. Component 2
remained water resource management with some changes to outputs and indicators to better
reflect the key areas of focus of ISP; policy & strategy formulation, knowledge management, and
basin monitoring. Component 3 remained water resource development and had strengthened
outputs and indicators which enabled the SAPs to better demonstrate the contribution of ISP to
their work. Component 4 originally covered stakeholder engagement. It was agreed this should
be integrated throughout the components, reflecting its cross cutting nature. Component 4 was
therefore revised to focus on corporate capacity, including corporate services, resource
mobilization, results based management, and Information Communication Technology.
Component 5 remained the same, managing the remaining two SVP projects – the Water
Resources Planning and Management (WRPMP) and Regional Power Trade (RPT) projects.

1.7 Other significant changes
There were no significant changes in design, scope, scale, or implementation arrangements during
the project. A minor change to the project’s scope was made during the Mid-Term Review,
deleting a small sub-component which was to facilitate signature and ratification of the CFA
which was no longer appropriate.

The unallocated project funds of US$3m were allocated to each Centre in June 2010. Subsequent
adjustments to allocations per Centre aimed to maximize the effective use of resources and to
ensure full utilization of project funds.



                                                                                               12
The Mid-Term Review took place as a participatory process approach from December 2010 to
April 2011. It reviewed progress, clarified core functions, revised the results framework and
components. The project was restructured in March 2012 on the basis of the MTR findings. This
included revision of the components, and a time extension of 9 months to 31 December 2012 (as
the maximum allowable prior to closure of the NBTF12).

The co-financier for component 2, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and
Development (BMZ) extended their support with an additional budget of Euro 1.3m (bringing
their total contribution to Euro 5.8m, US$7.6m equivalent) and with a 12 month time extension to
30 June 2013. This additional contribution continued to be implemented through the Deutsche
Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ, formerly GTZ), coordinated as an integral
part of the ISP with the World Bank.

South Sudan joined NBI as a formal member in July 2012. To support their integration, ISP
supported NBI senior management to travel Juba to discuss the NBI Shared Vision, Strategic Plan,
program framework, current projects, and member state obligations (such as financial
contributions), and to assess their priorities and requirements to benefit from NBI. South Sudan
will become the Chair of the NileCOM and NileTAC from July 2013 so this early introduction
was considered essential to assist them to fully take on their responsibilities on behalf of the other
nine member states.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project preparation was extensive and thorough. It was initiated at the request of the Nile Council
of Ministers in 2005. The NBI hired an international expert in transboundary basin management
and development to provide strategic guidance and through a consultative process with the
member countries, reviewed the needs and designed an appropriate project. Reflecting the
evolving nature of Nile cooperation, the project design was flexible, anticipating the transition to
a permanent basin institution, yet also leaving room for a slower transition.

Lessons of earlier operations were taken into account. Lessons from earlier engagement with the
NBI and experience from other international river basins were thoroughly taken into account.
Firstly, project design focused on developing a more robust institution with effective strategic
planning capacity, a corresponding strategic approach to river basin management, and
strengthening the ability to deliver results on the ground. Secondly, ISP was an integrated project,
aiming to consolidate and strengthen NBI as an institution, bringing the three Centers together
under the common goals. Thirdly, the design was based on a number of principles for the
institution including clarity of purpose, subsidiarity and local ownership. Finally, there was
significant attention to participation of all the NBI member states through the NileTAC. This
reflected the core nature of the ISP in addressing institutional strengthening issues. To ensure
appropriate guidance for the project within the overall NBI institutional structure, the NileTAC
was designated as the Project Steering Committee.

Risks were well identified with appropriate mitigation measures. The PAD identified six risks
and their mitigation measures, with an overall risk rating of Modest. The risks were:
    a) lengthy delays in agreement and ratification of the CFA


12
     The NBTF was subsequently extended by 2 years with all activities required to close by December 2014.

                                                                                                       13
     b) lack of agreement or ambiguity on the mandate, financing, shape and size of the future
        river basin organization
     c) that the ‘one basin, one NBI’ philosophy could not be translated into action
     d) ongoing operations could not be effectively integrated into the ISP
     e) that shifting from ‘project mode’ to ‘institution mode’ could be difficult
     f) that weak financial management and procurement capacity could impede implementation.

With hindsight these risks were all appropriate as were the majority of the proposed mitigation
measures. All the risks were realized at some stage during implementation and the various
measures were put into practice to successfully mitigate and manage them, resulting in successful
achievement of the project objective.

The first risk (rated substantial) regarding CFA delays was beyond the influence of the project.
As proposed in the PAD, even if delays persisted, the ISP could still fulfill important objectives,
consolidating gains and improving NBI’s effectiveness in performing existing functions and its
preparedness for future core functions. This was achieved with NBI strengthened as a transitional
institution. Progress with CFA ratification is ongoing and decisions on cooperation are still
evolving.

Participatory processes were extensive. Due to the fundamental nature of the ISPs’ engagement
with the NBI, the design of the ISP involved extensive consultation with the NBI member
countries through the NileTAC. NBI developed a number of background documents including a
paper on institutional directions and needs assessments of the 3 Centers in February 2007, as well
as a consultation document with TAC in March 2007. These documents along with TACs
responses formed the basis for the project design. According to the NBI Executive Director at the
time, there was much discussion over certain aspects of the project and sufficient time was taken
to ensure that there was full agreement of its scope. The project was approved by the NileCOM
in July 2008 and became effective in October 2008.

Quality at entry could have been improved. The project was complex and ambitious, particularly
given the capacity of the lead Center, the NileSEC, at the time of effectiveness and the relatively
short implementation timeframe with no time allotted for start-up. The NileSEC had to recruit
key staff which inevitably resulted in delays in getting initial activities underway in particular the
Institutional Design Study which was expected to inform the needs for strengthening of the
current institution as well as options for a future institution. It was noted in the Independent
Evaluation13 carried out at the mid-term in late 2010 that these delays should have been foreseen
and better mitigated based on the experience of starting up the Shared Vision Program. A more
detailed Project Implementation Plan would have helped to better guide the initial activities,
providing a clearer methodology than described in the more high level Project Appraisal
Document.

2.2 Implementation
Implementation at the start suffered from delays which had a knock-on effect. Delays were partly
as a consequence of misunderstanding of the nature of ISP as an NBI-wide program, of
insufficient capacity at the lead Centre and the ability to attract staff, and also of insufficient
leadership and management with the results framework considered as an administrative

requirement rather than as a management tool6. As a result, project ratings for performance and
pace were unsatisfactory or moderately unsatisfactory for over 18 months.

The Mid-Term Review (MTR) in late 2010 provided a turning point, coupled with stronger
leadership and management at the NileSEC. A participatory process was developed to ensure
greater ownership, with each Centre evaluating its progress and developing an action plan. The
implementation of the MTR actions enabled the NBI to improve performance and pace. This was
reflected in the successive upgrading of the Banks rating from moderately unsatisfactory to
moderately satisfactory and to satisfactory by the end of the project.

The MTR recommended an extension of the project timeframe and additional financing. This
was thoroughly considered by the Bank, approving the time extension but declining the additional
financing due to the long term under performance of the project (despite its turn-around after the
MTR). Restructuring was formally approved in March 2012.

Factors that contributed to success
There are a number of factors that contributed to the success of the project, enabling achievement
of the PDO of strengthening the foundation for institutional sustainability. These contribute to
lesson learning from the project.

The need for institutional strengthening was a clear demand from the NBI. The request from
NileCOM and the anticipated transition of NBI provided a clear demand for institutional
strengthening. The two SAPs were already well established and had some existing institutional
support, whereas the NileSEC had very limited functions and capacity14. ISP provided
comprehensive support, targeting institutional and organizational development and/or
strengthening of functions, capacity, policies, coordination, communications, systems and
procedures. With hindsight, whilst some stakeholders considered that the ISP should have started
earlier in NBI’s evolution, all were extremely positive that ISP was a necessary project at an
appropriate time.

An integrated project across the three Centers. ISP was designed explicitly to support better
integration of the three Centers under the ‘one NBI’ institutional framework. This aimed to avoid
fragmentation which was a stated risk considered during design. Despite the initial challenges
with NileSEC as the lead Centre but with the least capacity, and the resulting frustration this
caused within the more capable SAPs, integration developed according to needs and was
strengthened over the project duration. The change in collaboration and cooperation is
considered by staff to be appreciable with cross sharing and learning through thematic groups,
working groups for particular issues, and joint visits. The extent of harmonization is appropriate,
respecting each Center’s different requirements and the autonomy of operations within the NBI
framework.

Clarification of core functions and related responsibilities of SEC and SAPs. With the approval
of NileCOM, the ISP introduced new functions to NBI as part of planning for the transition to a
permanent river basin organization, in particular for the NileSEC with the establishment of a
water resource management function. Whilst the project design was clear on the objective and
required activities, these needed clarification and clearer delineation of roles and responsibilities


14
  In 2008, the NileSEC’s function was secretariat to the NileCOM and TAC and coordination of the
Shared Vision Program projects.


                                                                                                    15
between the Centers. This was achieved as part of the MTR and enabled a better understanding
of the objective and expected outcomes of the ISP as well as focusing all activities on achieving
these outcomes. NBI subsequently used the core functions as a basis for its program framework
and for all activities. The clarification of core functions is credited as a significant success of ISP,
helping NBI to strengthen understanding of its identity both internally and externally. The first
ever NBI annual report in 2010/11focused on explaining the core functions with examples of
achievements to date.

Clarity of strategic direction, with a plan and program framework for alignment of development
partner support. Linked to greater clarity of core functions, NBI developed a strategic plan for
2012-2016 outlining the priorities for NBI as an institution, and also developed related Centre
specific plans. These informed the plans for the program, with a consolidated concept note of
project proposals presented to partners in November 2011 at the annual Strategic Dialogue. This
demonstrated the growing maturity and capacity of NBI and was welcomed by partners15.

Definition of minimum functionality and agreement by Member States to meet cost to underpin
financial sustainability. Developing the approach and agreeing the basis for financial
sustainability was a fundamental aspect of institutional strengthening achieved by ISP. As a
process approach led by the SEC and based on the core functions, each Centre defined its
‘minimum functionality’ as the basic level of staff, operations, and activities required to sustain
its functions. This was costed and options for increasing member state financing to cover these
costs developed and discussed with NileTAC in 2011, with subsequent endorsement by the
NileCOM in July 2012. Member state contributions to NBI are expected to increase from
US$690,000 (18% of minimum functionality) in 2012 to US$4.44m in 2017 (117% of minimum
functionality). This was a substantial achievement and once fully implemented, NBI will no
longer be reliant on donors for core financing. NBI will join the few basin organizations in
Africa to have achieved this. This commitment underpins the institutional strength of NBI.

Broad based and flexible support to meet needs and a sound partnership between co-financiers.
ISP was a comprehensive project and as a result enabled flexibility to meet the needs of the
evolving institution. Work plans and budgets were developed on an annual basis for agreement
by the NileTAC and by the World Bank and GIZ as implementing partners. As required, these
were reviewed and revised during the year. This flexibility required constructive and regular
support from the Bank and GIZ teams. The ISP partnership of co-financiers for component 2
required close working and was considered broadly successful. The different approaches to
financial reporting of the grant caused some concerns, with the Bank disbursing 100% of project
funds directly to the NBI, and GIZ disbursing about a third of funds to NBI. To mitigate this,
GIZ reported on expenditures for main budget items to NBI.

Agreement of a time extension. The time extension enabled NBI to capitalize on the clarity and
learning of the MTR and to implement the agreed actions. This resulted in progressive
improvement of the projects’ rating and achievement of the projects’ objective that would not
have been possible without the extension. In addition, if ISP had ended as originally scheduled
on 31 March 2012, the eleven other NBTF funded projects would have been affected, since ISP
provided a substantial proportion of core operating costs to NBI (approximately 75%).

     Summary of Discussions, 6th Strategic Dialogue, NBI, November 2011

Factors that caused implementation problems
There were also a number of factors that caused constraints to the implementation of the project
and which also contribute to lesson learning.

Implications of the political process to develop a Nile Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement
(CFA). Due to differences of opinion on a key article in the CFA and a break of consensus, two
NBI member states froze participation in NBI activities in 2010. The impact was severest in the
Eastern Nile where ENTRO governance was no longer meeting, taking no decisions on strategic
issues, and did not agree replacement of the three rotating posts16. In addition, the two countries
stopped paying their annual contributions to NBI which reduced the contribution to ISP, requiring
some adjustment of budgets17. The implications for ISP overall were manageable since the
prospect of a delayed CFA had been anticipated, however it unsurprisingly resulted in greater
reticence by the NileTAC to make major structural changes. This included consideration of the
hierarchy of the TACs and the related formal linkages between the three Centers18. However
despite these issues, all the strengthening activities remained valid for the ongoing transitional
institution. A primary impact on ISP activities was on the consultation processes for the
Institutional Design Study (IDS) which no longer involved all member countries. This reduced its
validity as an agreed strategic document to inform the future (since the future was now under
debate) but it was continued to completion with the addition of consideration of the requirements
if not all members joined on commencement of the commission. The study was debated
extensively with a preferred option defined, and is expected to inform the future institutional
design at an appropriate time.

Stability of appointment of the Centre heads and the professional team. Of the three Centers, only
NELSAP-CU has benefited from a largely stable professional team and the same head (the
Regional Coordinator) during ISPs duration. This undoubtedly has assisted their effective
performance and team working. Both NileSEC and ENTRO have unfortunately had several
major staff changes, including the Centre heads. A structural institutional issue raised by the IDS
was the rotation of the Executive Director (ED) of the NBI Secretariat, a political appointment by
the member countries in alphabetical order, on a two year term. This was considered undesirable
for the NBI as it inevitably resulted in a certain amount of change in direction and lost
momentum with each new ED, despite a period of handover. During the design and
implementation of ISP there were four EDs. To help mitigate this, a deputy ED post was
proposed to ensure greater continuity, similar to the situation in government ministries with the
minister and a permanent secretary. This issue was reviewed by the NileTAC but prior to
transition with the ratification of the CFA, it was considered inappropriate to implement.



16
   ENTRO has three senior posts which rotate between the three member countries. The posts are the
Executive Director, the Head of Finance, and the Regional Project Coordinator. Once the term of the posts
expired, no replacements were agreed. This is still the case with an Officer in Charge instead of a
substantive Executive Director. The Head of Finance was agreed to remain in post considering the
fiduciary responsibilities of ENTROs grant agreements.
17
  For example, ISP paid the full costs of the ENTRO Head of Finance rather than half from member state
contributions.
18
  The PAD (p78) shows a hierarchical structure of NileTAC with subsidiary ENSAPT and NELTAC
focusing on the business of the SAPs. However, even at design stage, there were concerns that in practice
the structure was less clear, with the hierarchy not well defined and limited horizontal linkages – both
which would be required to achieve unity of purpose and action across the Nile Basin.

                                                                                                       17
ENTRO also has a rotation of its ED as well as two further senior staff posts but with competitive
recruitment and on a three year term. With the freeze in participation by two member countries,
the rotation of posts due in early 2012 did not take place. Following the departure of the ED in
May 2012, there remains no decision on a replacement and ENTRO continues to remain without
an ED and a senior regional program coordinator. Despite many requests by ENTRO to NileTAC
to encourage the Eastern Nile countries to resolve the issues and enable ENTRO to operate
effectively, no action has to date been achieved.

Effectiveness of the Project Steering Committee as NileTAC. The ISP designated one member per
country from the NileTAC as the Project Steering Committee (PSC) to provide strategic guidance.
Briefings were regularly provided as part of usual TAC business, since ISP effectively was
engaged with all the operations of the NBI. Whilst the TAC guidance was paramount for a
project of this nature, some concerns were raised that it was not strategic enough and frequently
delved into operational matters. This was partially mitigated by greater focus by the NileSEC on
agenda setting with specific requests for guidance. With an increased focus on reporting results
at the program rather than a project level, the NBI expects to better support the NileTAC in its
strategic role. As is the case currently, when review of specific issues in more depth is required,
NileTAC sub-committees will be constituted.

Insufficient effectiveness of the National NBI Offices. For a basin organization to be effective, it
requires supportive operations at a national level. ISP provided some limited support at a national
level to enable increased visibility, better integration of regional and national policies and plans,
and coordination between sectors. This support was insufficient to have a substantial impact on
performance. Development Partners are noted to have frequently stated that the responsibility for
the national office is with the country, led by the TAC member, including financial support as a
sign of commitment and ownership of NBI. However the balance struck between technical and
financial support, and the proactive management of the TAC, will need to be revisited to ensure
this aspect is more effective in future.

Lack of an agreed NBI salary and benefits structure. One of the key studies under ISP was the
Human Resources Study which included development of an NBI salary and benefits structure.
Despite proactive management of the consultants, and regular discussion with the related TAC
Sub-Committee, this was not completed prior to the end of ISP. NBI remains on an interim
salary scale developed at the start of ISP with subsequent annual adjustments. Finalization of the
salary scale is an agreed priority for NBI to ensure equity between different posts and between
different Centers.

Capacity of the lead Centre at the start of the project. As noted earlier, start-up of the project
was delayed due to the need to hire key staff at the NileSEC. This impacted on the initiation of
the Institutional Design Study which aimed to identify measures to enhance the effectiveness of
the institution as well as reviewing future options. This caused frustration with the more capable
SAPs and required adjustment to the project at the MTR to ensure clear roles and responsibilities,
and appropriate levels of harmonization according to need. As the capacity of the SEC increased,
performance and pace improved.

Delayed agreement of the water resources management (WRM) function at NileSEC. A clear
objective of ISP was to establish a WRM function at NileSEC in preparation for its anticipated
transition to a river basin commission. With the support of the SVP Water Resources Planning &
Management project (WRPMP, P116318), NileTAC finally approved the function, department
structure and staffing in July 2011. This was in time to plan for and ensure the effective
transition of WRPMP projects’ primary output the Nile Basin Decision Support System (DSS)

                                                                                                  18
from the Project Management Unit in Addis Ababa to the long term home, the NileSEC, as the
expert center for basin wide knowledge and analysis.

Mainstreaming of the Shared Vision Program outcomes and outputs. Part of the rationale for ISP
was to ensure the gains from the Shared Vision Program projects were not lost. The appropriate
outcomes and outputs which would be key to NBI’s core functions would be incorporated into
ISP, notably those related to water resource management and planning, transboundary
environmental strategies, and stakeholder participation and communications strategies and
capabilities. This was defined in the SVP Strategy for Mainstreaming. Whilst generally
successful in terms of mainstreaming the relevant outputs, maintaining the networks of
professionals was less successfully continued19. In addition, countries felt the closure of an SVP
project at the national level had reduced NBIs visibility – and combined with the insufficient
effectiveness of the national office, this is considered to have overall lost NBI some momentum.
These issues are appreciated by NBI and measures to re-connect priority networks are now
proposed. The exceptions to this are the WRPM project with the primary output the Nile Basin
DSS successfully mainstreamed across NBI and the member countries20.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design. The M&E system for the ISP was based on the results framework in the PAD. It
was largely appropriate with indicators, baselines and annual targets at objective, outcome and
output levels. With the revision of the results framework at the MTR in early 2011, the M&E
system was also revised. A comprehensive Performance Management Framework was developed
including the baselines, end of project targets, and interim six monthly targets. This gained better
understanding of the results framework and its targets by all staff and as a consequence improved
monitoring and follow-up.

M&E implementation. The NileSEC was responsible for and managed the overall M&E system
for the project, with ENTRO and NELSAP-CU retaining their own specific but related
monitoring systems. This enabled effective aggregation of results by the NileSEC for overall
monitoring and reporting of project progress, including review of implementation progress and
budget expenditure. Whilst the timely flow of information between Centers was initially a
challenge, this was resolved with clearer and joint planning of M&E and reporting requirements
in advance. Staff were designated as M&E officers in each Centre and received training. M&E
was rated as moderately satisfactory largely throughout the project, with a focus on higher level
reporting encouraged. It is also considered that more could have been done to gain feedback
from key stakeholders on a regular basis to inform and better target communication activities and
products.

M&E Utilization. The M&E system was utilized by the senior management of the NBI, the
various NBI task teams and the Bank team to track project implementation and results. While
quarterly reports were disseminated for NBI internally, six monthly reports and annual reports

  Additionally, during the implementation of ISP, the regional power networks were continued under the
Regional Power Trade II (P116745) – they have since been passed on to the Eastern Africa Power Pool.
Also the agricultural networks formed under Efficient Water Use project (P075947) which were maintained
under the Regional Agricultural Trade Project (P115414).

                                                                                                    19
were disseminated to the NileTAC for the purpose of information, accountability and learning.
These reports formed the basis for the Banks Implementation Support Missions.

NileSEC also introduced a portfolio monitoring tool for all NBI projects. On a quarterly basis, all
Centers reviewed progress across the portfolio, assessing the %achieved in relation to %time
and %spent, and with a corresponding ‘traffic light’ rating system. This provided a quick and
easy overview for senior management to identify problems and agree mitigation measures with
the corresponding teams. This initiative was credited by NELSAP-CU as helping them to deliver
effectively on their NBTF portfolio of eight projects of value US$37 million.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguard compliance. As noted in the PAD, the project was classified as a Category B project
because one component was to strengthen the NBI’s water resources development ability to
identify, prepare, and raise financing for investment projects which might entail safeguard policy
risks. The project did not include or directly finance any activity that had safeguard impacts. In
fact, a major goal of this project was to ensure and enhance human resource capacity for
addressing safeguards within the NBI institutions.

One of the key outcomes of the project was a comprehensive Environment and Social Policy that
reflects international safeguards standards. This drew on national assessments conducted in every
NBI member country and sub-regional validation workshops to discuss the findings. In addition,
guidelines for project preparation were prepared and were in use by the SAPs. Throughout the
project, input was received from the Banks environment and social specialists to guide and
review the draft documents. NBI’s social and environmental staff received training such as in
social analysis and resettlement.

NELSAP-CU reported the preparation of the policy and guidelines was a learning exercise for
them which they immediately put into practice on the NBTF funded Rusumo Falls hydro-electric
scheme project to support the three countries to develop the Resettlement Action Plan and
Environment & Social Impact Assessment. Overall both ENTRO and NELSAP-CU reflected on
ISPs support to mainstream social and environmental understanding and requirements throughout
NBI’s water resources planning and development functions. This was noted to have changed the
attitude and sensitized the engineers who now took the issues seriously and ensured the required
integration into the project preparation process.

Financial management. Financial management for the project was satisfactory and the financial
management risk was moderate. The basis for this assessment is as follows:
    The NBI maintained adequate staffing arrangements in each Centre and has computerized
       accounting systems for all accounting operations.
    The NBI developed a financial management manual approved by the Bank as well as an
       internal audit strategy and manual.
    The NBI submitted timely and acceptable quality Interim Financial Reports on a
       quarterly basis within the stipulated deadline of 45 days after the end of the quarter
       through the E-Signature and E-Disbursements processes with the Bank’s client
       connection system.
    The accounting for projects funds was satisfactory with no ineligible expenditure being
       reported.
    The project consistently submitted audited financial statements and the associated
       management letter within the stipulated deadline. The past audit reports for FY09-12
       were unqualified.

                                                                                                20
       Budgeting and budget management in coordination with the technical teams’ work
        planning improved substantially during the projects implementation.
       The project disbursed 100% of the grant amount of US$ 24.02 million, utilizing all the
        funds within the project period.

As a result of sound financial management, the Bank recommended to transition from statement
of expenditure disbursement to report based disbursement. This was deferred as less than one
year was remaining on the project’s duration but is now implemented by the successor project.

Procurement. Procurement compliance has generally been rated as moderately satisfactory.
NBI’s three Centers have maintained appropriate capacity, systems and procedures throughout
the duration of the project, with strengthening as required. Procurement staff were familiar with
Bank procedures and received training. NBI developed a procurement manual which was
approved by the Bank, and has been updated in line with Bank amendments. Procurement plans
have been in place for each Centre related to the work plans and were regularly updated and
reviewed as required. Procurement, financial and technical teams worked closely together to
ensure coherence and timely progress. Post procurement reviews were undertaken periodically
and an action plan maintained to ensure areas of weakness were resolved such as record keeping.
Whilst the ISP contained no major procurement activities, with the exception of two consultancy
contracts for the IDS and HR study, the procurement capacity strengthened by ISP was of benefit
across the NBI portfolio of projects. This assisted timely implementation.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
The achievements of ISP will be sustained as part of the ongoing operations of the NBI. With the
closure of ISP, NBI had developed into a stronger and more mature institution, with demonstrated
capability to attract financial support from a range of bilateral and multi-lateral sources.
Increased diversification of funding was recognized by NBI to be desirable, reducing the
dependency on the NBTF and hence reducing the risk inherent with a dedicated funding source.
A key part of reducing dependency achieved under ISP was the commitment to increase member
state contributions, starting in July 2013. In addition, ISP strengthened strategic planning
capacity, resource mobilization capacity, the focus on a programmatic approach and results, and
corporate communications – all enabling NBI to have increasingly greater visibility with member
countries and donors.

Continued support from the NBTF was proposed and planned well in advance with an outline
concept presented to the NBI and donors at the annual meeting in October 2011. This reflected
the ongoing demand and needs of the NBI as well as its important role and achievements, and the
continuing desire by the NBTF donors for strong support to the Nile Basin. The new project
consolidated some of the primary outcomes from the twelve NBTF projects which closed in
December 2012 into one project - the NBTF/CIWA Nile Cooperation for Results project
(NCORE, P130694) which started on 1 January 2013.

NCORE builds directly on the institutional foundation strengthened by the ISP utilizing the
capacity, policies, systems, and procedures to enable a greater focus on delivering results. The
transition from ISP to NCORE was successfully completed with the Bank Task team Leaders for
ISP and NCORE working closely together to ensure an appropriate and forward looking
transition. Unlike ISP, NCORE does not fund NBI governance meetings with the full cost of
these now met from the increasing member state contributions. NCORE will continue to
strengthen water resources management and development across NBI, as well as continuing to
support targeted communications and stakeholder engagement.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The project’s objective was highly relevant for the riparian countries. The institutional
strengthening of the NBI aimed to underpin its foundations in order to support the member
countries to achieve sustainable socio-economic development through the equitable utilization of
the shared water resources. The focus areas of strengthening (facilitating cooperation, water
resources management, water resources development and corporate management) directly relate
to NBI’s functions in line with the mandate given by the member countries.

The project’s objective was also relevant for global priorities. The stability and development of
the Nile region is of global significance. Eight of the eleven basin countries rank amongst the
lowest globally for GDP per capita with significant challenges of food security, energy security,
and management of water relates shocks such as droughts and floods. The Nile basin population
of 238 million people accounts for a quarter of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa (or half if
the total country population is considered), with an estimated 72% living in the rural areas. With
the high dependency on subsistence rain-fed agriculture for basic livelihoods and employment,
and the uncertainty of future climate variability, tackling the sustainable development of the
region through an institutionalized approach to cooperative management and development of the
shared water resources is paramount. In addition, the Nile Basin holds environmental assets of
global significance including the Sudd swamps and Lake Victoria. These need to be protected
from the growing demands of water use and appropriately managed within a basin wide
framework such as provided by the NBI.

The project’s objective was relevant for the Banks regional assistance strategy. This recognizes
the need for regional cooperation to achieve poverty reduction and economic growth especially
for land locked countries. ISP strengthened NBI’s capacity to facilitate cooperative water
resources development, identifying and preparing investment projects of regional significance.
Examples are the three country Rusumo Falls hydro-electric scheme, the five country network of
power transmission lines, as well as investments in watershed management and storage for
irrigation.

The project objective remained highly relevant in terms of current World Bank country21 and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals, contributing directly to the following:
     The Nile engagement program, that supports cooperative initiatives that advance
         responsible and sustainable development and management of shared Nile waters;
     Regional Integration Assistance Strategy (RIAS) and the Africa Region strategy that
         recognize regional approaches as a means for increasing opportunities and for realizing
         economies of scale; and
     Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) goals of many of the Nile Basin countries that
         include the promotion of economic growth, improved food security, and regional
         integration.

The project’s design and implementation were also relevant, despite the ambitious
implementation timeframe. The design was technically sound and the components appropriately
related and were consistent with the objective. As noted earlier in section 2.1, design reflected
the experience of other international river basins. Project preparation was carried out in close
consultation with the riparian countries which continued throughout implementation.

 3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The ISP, by and large, was able to achieve its development objective; the NBI has strengthened
foundation for institutional sustainability, enhanced capacity, and harmonized corporate
management to more effectively deliver programs and projects. It should be noted that the project
objective related to NBI’s strengthened foundation and that ongoing strengthening is expected to
be required in the coming years as Nile cooperation continues to evolve and have implications for
the institution.

Breaking down the project objective:

        NBI has a sound foundation for institutional sustainability. The ISP supported NBI to
         clarify its core functions and to develop a clear strategic direction for the next five years -
         both endorsed by the Nile Council of Ministers (Boxes 1 and 2) - which, unlike in the past
         since neither of these existed, provides NBI with a clear basis for its medium term
         operations. It must be noted that whilst Nile cooperation continues to evolve, the
         institutional arrangements will also evolve as required by the Member States including as
         required the transition to a permanent river basin commission on ratification of the
         Comprehensive Framework Agreement. The ISP provided guidance for the future
         through the Institutional Design Study which thoroughly reviewed options and
         requirements. This study was widely consultative with the NileTAC who have
         undertaken to implement the recommendations as and when appropriate. Institutional
         sustainability is underpinned by financial sustainability and an important contribution of
         ISP was to support NBI to gain Member State commitment to fully finance the costs of
         NBI’s minimum functionality, amounting to US$3.5 million a year by 2017. This
         provides NBI’s with assurance of continuity of its basic operations without reliance on
         donor support. The NBI must, however, ensure that this commitment is translated into
         action, starting in July 2013 with the first increased payment. All indications to date are
         that the Member States will implement this commitment.

        Box 1: NBI Core Functions

        Facilitating Cooperation: To facilitate, support and nurture cooperation amongst the Nile
        Basin countries so as to promote timely and efficient joint actions required for securing
        benefit from the common Nile Basin water resources.
        Water Resource Management: To assess, manage and safeguard the water resource base
        that supports the peoples of the Nile Basin through applying the principles of knowledge-
        based IWRM to water development planning and assessment.
        Water Resource Development: To identify, prepare and facilitate investment in trans-
        boundary water development projects and programs whilst avoiding negative impacts on the
        health of the Nile Basin’s resources through applying the principles of IWRM.




                                                                                                     23
    NBI has enhanced capacity to carry out its functions. The ISP supported NBI to
     strengthen management and expert sectoral technical skills including strategic planning,
     programmatic focus, portfolio management, and multi-sectoral water resources planning,
     management, and development. An aspect of this included integration of the Nile Basin
     Decision Support System across all three Centers which for example, informed the Multi-
     Sector Investment Opportunities Analysis for the Nile Equatorial Lakes region. The ISP
     also supported NBI to improve environmental and social safeguards with the development
     of a basin wide policy and sub basin guidelines based on comprehensive national
     assessments. These including impact assessments and resettlement action planning and
     will assist NBI to ensure adherence to international standards for project identification
     and preparation. The skills developed under ISP were immediately put to use to support
     the preparation of a three country US$400 million project, the Rusumo Falls hydroelectric
     scheme which subsequently gained investment financing from IDA and AfDB
     demonstrating NBI’s sound project preparation.

Box 2: NBI Overarching Specific Objectives – 2012-2016
(Source: NBI Strategic Plan 2012-2016)

    1. The level and degree of cooperation between the member countries raised. This is to be
       pursued through a more proactive NBI Secretariat; through promoting wider use of the unique
       platform for inter-country dialogue provided by NBI; through actively encouraging the current
       sub-Basin cooperative discourse and actions to extend across whole-of-Basin matters; through
       establishing judicious links with appropriate regional institutions; and through strategic
       engagement of relevant parts of civil society.
    2. The impact, reputation and effectiveness of the Subsidiary Action Programs intensified.
       This is to be pursued through continuing to build solid technical capabilities; through a focus on
       efficiency and cost-effectiveness; through more proactive promotion of development and
       resource mobilization; through reinforcing well-chosen avenues of communication and
       engagement; and through applying the principles of concentration of force by strategic targeting
       of interventions and projects with most potential for meeting NBI Objectives.
    3. National Focal Points reinforced and effective. This is to be achieved through promoting and
       making known their importance to NBI communications and operations; through training and
       strengthening aimed at leveling NFP capacities across the Basin; through establishing a twice-
       yearly NFP Forum; and through formulating and applying guidelines for efficient conduct of
       NBI business by constructive engagement and use of the NFPs.
    4. The architecture of a single NBI integrated knowledge management system established
       and operational. This will have intelligent access portals and interactive capabilities which
       meets the needs of NBI Centers, member countries, decision-makers, and the Basin community.
    5. Member country commitment up scaled. This is to be pursued through demonstrating the
       tangible benefits accruing across the Nile Basin countries, and through communicating the
       added value of joint projects together with the mutual benefits flowing from cooperative actions
       in water resource management.
    6. Nile-SEC is streamlined into a professional, and highly focused secretariat (by end 2012,
       within ISP). The Secretariat can then swiftly concentrate its efforts on actively raising the
       level, intensity and effectiveness of Nile Basin cooperation and inter-country dialogue, and on
       providing and applying knowledge-based integrated water resources management to underpin
       this dialogue and to enable and encourage water planning that achieves optimal use and win-win
       gains.
    7. Financial sustainability ensured through formulation and implementation of financial
       sustainability plan. This will cover both income generation for NBI core functions and
       resource mobilization for investments facilitated through the Subsidiary Action Program.
       Independent of the plan, an immediate start is required on recovery of indirect costs.

                                                                                                       24
        NBI has strengthened and harmonized corporate management. The ISP supported NBI to
         strengthen its work planning & budgeting processes, to improve staff performance
         management with the implementation of a new HR Manual, to develop NBI specific
         finance and procurement manuals with training on their use, and to strengthen external
         and internal communications. Overall demonstration of this enhanced capacity was the
         100% expenditure of the ISP and the successful management and timely closure of the
         other nine NBTF funded projects.

        Resulting from the aggregation of these factors, NBI has demonstrated its ability to
         effectively manage its programs and projects with a portfolio of over US$100m in 2012,
         and by its ability to attract investment financing to date with secured financing
         commitments of US$1.3 billion from a variety of sources including IDA and AfDB.
         Whilst in most cases NBI’s engagement is completed after preparation and mobilization
         of financing with the countries assuming responsibility for implementation, to date in one
         case NBI has been requested to support implementation including establishing a Special
         Purpose Vehicle for the Rusumo Falls hydroelectric scheme. The leverage of pre-
         investment to investment financing is about a 1:10 ratio (Box 3).

Box 3: Investment financing leverage (Source: NBI Strategic Plan 2012-2016)




Assessment of achievement was based on the results framework indicators at objective and
outcome levels and their targets for the end of the project, presentations by each of Centers on
results achieved related to the results framework, and by review of their Institutional Health
Check22 completed as part of the implementation support mission in July 2012.


22
  The Institutional Health Check was a facilitated team exercise carried out by each Centre of the NBI to
objectively review and assess the status of a range of issues within four categories related to institutional
strength; the institutional basis, financial basis, technical capacity and operational capacity.




                                                                                                                25
The achievement in relation to the objective level indicator targets is provided in table 1. Overall,
NBI has successfully achieved the end of project targets. This is a significant achievement for a
complex, regional institutional strengthening project within a relatively short timeframe.

In addition to the objective indicators, the NBI presented its achievements in relation to
strengthening the institution itself, strengthening delivery of its programs and projects, and
supporting the future of the institution. These are noted below, each with the primary outcomes
and examples of related outputs.

ISP’s strengthening of NBI as an institution
NBI has clarified its strategic direction
    NBI five year Strategic Plan developed and approved by NileCOM in July 2012, with
        more detailed Centre specific strategic plans also developed and approved
    Core functions of facilitating cooperation, water resources management & development
        plus corporate services clarified and approved by NileCOM in July 2012
    Program framework based on core functions developed with a suite of project proposals
        developed for presentation to donors in November 2011 and subsequently updated to
        continue promoting project opportunities
    Effective donor partnerships strengthened and focused on results (eg. annual NBI
        Strategic Dialogue) with support aligned to strategic direction
    Institutional identify strengthened both internally and externally, including with the
        publication of the NBI annual report

NBI has strengthened its financial sustainability
    Minimum functionality definition & cost developed
    Commitment to increase member state contributions to fully fund the costs of minimum
       functionality of US$3.8 million a year approved by NileCOM in July 2012
    Financing strategy approved by NileCOM in July 2012 with subsequent establishment of
       NBI Trust Fund and reserve fund
    Marketing capacity developed with appropriate professional materials (eg. annual report,
       country benefit profiles, project profiles)
    Reducing dependency on donors for core costs and diversification of funding sources
       from the NBTF

NBI has strengthened technical capacity, policies, procedures and systems to effectively deliver
its core functions
      Sound capability for water resources management & planning, utilizing tools, data and
         information including the expert Nile Basin Decision System
      Strengthened knowledge base and basin monitoring (eg. State of the Basin report, Basin
         monitoring strategy, Nile-Information System)
      Appropriate policies, strategies and procedures (e.g. the Nile Basin Sustainability
         Framework with Environmental & Social Policy and Guidelines, wetlands & climate
         change policies) and support to countries to strengthen transboundary considerations in
         national policies
      Effective program & project management, monitoring & reporting strengthened
      Appropriate organizational structure, networking, and partnerships clarified
      Strong financial management, procurement and support systems, demonstrated by
         unqualified annual audits and full expenditure of project budgets

ISP’s contribution to NBI’s programs & projects
ISP provided core support across the NBI, enabling the implementation of all projects including
the other ten NBTF funded projects and projects funded by other donors – of combined (grant)
value over US$100 million. Of the other ten NBTF projects at the closing missions, eight were


                                                                                               27
rated as satisfactory, one moderately satisfactory and one moderately unsatisfactory, the latter
largely due to operational constraints within the Eastern Nile political context. This overall
demonstrates NBI’s capacity for implementation of a wide range of projects across the basin.

Under ISP, ENTRO & NELSAP-CU strengthened their catalytic and enabling role to support
member states for the identification, preparation and implementation facilitation of programs and
projects with transboundary implications:
     Strengthened foundation for development of multi-sectoral investment programs
        (mainstreamed environment, social, investment mobilization, & climate change issues
        into the project preparation cycle)
     Strengthened national capacity for project identification, preparation and implementation
        and provided support for policy development
     Supported US$93 million project identification & preparation (eg. watershed delineation,
        flood monitoring, flood management, fisheries, river basin management)
     Supported US$1.3 billion of projects under implementation with secured financing (eg.
        power interconnections and generation, watershed management)
     Impressive value for money ratios: US$4m of member states contribution has enabled
        US$93 million of preparation which has enabled in excess of US$1.3 billion of
        investment financing

ISP’s contribution to NBI’s future
NBI provides a sound platform for ongoing dialogue and cooperation through the Nile Council of
Ministers and the Nile Technical Advisory Committee
    Established institutional credibility, maturity, strength and resilience
    Proven facilitation of information sharing on planned measures (prior notification)
        despite this not being obligatory within the current transitional NBI status
    Expert analytical capacity and knowledge of water management and development issues
        in the basin to inform decision making

NBI is well placed for transition into a permanent institution as the situation in the basin
continues to evolve through broader political negotiations
     Explored institutional options to provide possible future institutional direction, design
        and linkages
     Reviewed legal and institutional requirements for transition from NBI to a permanent
        institution

NBI is becoming the ‘go-to’ technical institution for the Nile Basin for Member States and with
plans to increase public access to knowledge across the basin
     Modeling and decision support systems for water resource management and planning (eg.
         identification of priority basin wide issues for analysis to inform knowledge and planning,
         sub-basin analysis of development opportunities and trade-offs)
     Leadership in regional power sector planning (eg. identification and preparation of power
         interconnections between five countries in the NEL region, with demonstrated quality of
         preparation as investment financing is secured)
     Leadership in identification & preparation of water resources development opportunities
         (eg. Eastern Nile watershed management project identification, NEL project preparation
         in the three sub-basins; Mara, Sio-Malaba-Malakisi, Kagera with financing secured)
     Facilitation of investment mobilization and as requested, implementation (eg.
         establishment of a Special Purpose Vehicle for the three country Rusumo Falls
         hydroelectric scheme)

                                                                                                   28
NBI is a robust partner for Member States to explore cooperative transboundary water resources
management and development
    Recognition of added value by majority of Member States including stated commitment
        to NBI and agreed schedule for increasing financial contributions starting in July 2013
    Donor and investor confidence with assurance of funding for 2013 and beyond (eg.
        projects agreed with NBTF/CIWA , AfDB, BMZ/GIZ, & Sida and interest from other
        donors including AFD, SDC, & Norad)


Progress towards achievement of outcomes and intermediate indicators
The ISP fully achieved its five project outcomes as measured by the intermediate indicators.
Annex 2 table 1 provides an assessment of achievement of each outcome related to the indicators’
end of project target.

The causal linkages between outputs and outcomes was very clear with an appropriate logical
flow. For example to improve capacity to facilitate cooperation (outcome 1), NBI outputs
included strengthening the secretariat function for TAC and COM, strengthening the institutional
arrangements with strategic plans and the Institutional Design Study, and strengthening external
relations to increase visibility about Nile cooperation. Similarly to improve water resources
management (outcome 2), NBI developed policies and strategies, established a knowledge base
with analytical tools and capacity, and strengthened monitoring of the basin including publishing
the first ever comprehensive report on the state of the basin. The logical flow from output to
outcomes reflected the sound design of the project.

3.3 Efficiency
As an institutional strengthening project, ISP does not lend itself to standard efficiency
evaluations (net present value, economic rate of return, cost-benefit analysis, or measuring actual
costs against a benchmark). The economic justification of the project lies in its facilitating role in
the generation of economic benefits throughout the basin through sustainable management and
cooperative development. The project initiated NBI’s knowledge-based integrated water resource
management function, and so will facilitate sustainable water planning built around basin-wide
benefit sharing strategies. It is expected that in the longer term NBI will be able to develop a full
basin sustainability function, delivering real environmental benefits and creating the framework
for optimal basin-wide planning and the development of water resources. The project has also
strengthened NBI’s capability to deliver development projects, resulting in direct economic
benefits to the riparians through investment financing. Overall the project was implemented
within its budget and successfully achieved its outcomes and outputs.

The nature and extent of the longer term benefits to be drawn from basin-wide cooperation are
hard to quantify, but they include direct economic benefits, environmental benefits, and political
benefits. Direct economic benefits result from more efficient use of water, and hence greater
outputs in sectors such as irrigation and hydropower. Direct economic benefits will also accrue
from progressive regional integration, which will result in increased productivity and increased
transboundary trade. Environmental benefits will stem from greater conservation, and more
sustainable use of environmental systems. The improved management of environmental goods
resulting from cooperative Nile water management and development will certainly provide
economic benefits, such as reduced erosion and siltation. Finally, political benefits include
increased stability and diminished tensions, and the consequent peaceful environment within
which economies are more likely to thrive.

                                                                                                   29
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Combining relevance, achievement of the objective and efficiency the ISP is considered to be
satisfactory. The project was relevant to regional and global priorities, and to the Bank regional
and national assistance strategies. It achieved its objective of strengthening the foundation for
institutional sustainability, and it was broadly considered to be efficient.

The restructuring of the project included amendments of PDO indicators, two outcomes and the
outcome indicators to make them more specific and measurable. According to ICR Guidelines23,
this requires a ‘split’ evaluation with the project outcomes weighted according to the amount of
funds disbursed pre and post the restructuring. The changes to the PDO indicators are noted in
section 1.2 and changes to the outcomes are noted in table 2 and in detail in annex 2, table 2.
None of the changes were substantial in content or extent but they enabled greater clarity for
project implementation as they aligned directly with the newly agreed NBI core functions. The
changes to the components and to the outcomes were implemented directly following the MTR in
May 2011 in order to support the project to move from ‘problem’ status with its moderately
unsatisfactory performance. This was successful with the better clarity enabling NBI to achieve
better performance and pace. However due to lengthy discussions about the NBI’s request for
additional financing, the MTR changes were not formally introduced until much later in March
2012. The expenditure status at MTR was US$16.0m (66%) and at restructuring was US$18.8m
(78%).

Overall the split evaluation makes no difference to the overall project rating since the changes
made did not affect targets or extent of achievement and both were rated as moderately
satisfactory. The indicators and end of project targets were if anything more difficult to achieve
since they were less subjective and more quantifiable.

A review of the project’s counterfactual (based on the absence of consolidated efforts by the
Member States and Development Partners through a unified funding mechanism to strengthen
institutional capacity) indicates that support to NBI may have been less effective due to number


23
     ICR Guidelines, August 2006, updated October 2011.


                                                                                                         30
of factors. These include the lack of an overarching framework for identifying and targeting
support and hence the likelihood of more fragmented support with an increased burden for
management on a weak institution, possibly more risk adversity within a challenging political
context which may have reduced the available financial support, and perhaps more of a focus on
water resources management from bilateral donors. All of these individually or combined would
have had an impact on the effectiveness of support to NBI. In particular if support had less focus
on water resources development, this arguably would have resulted in less cooperation since the
Member States are adamant that they wish to have ‘action on the ground’ as a result of
cooperation, and this in turn supports their engagement at a regional level.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
By strengthening the NBI, the project indirectly contributed to poverty reduction through the
sustainable socio-economic development of the shared water resources of the riparian countries.
As noted earlier, the 232 million people living in the basin rely substantially (directly and
indirectly) on the shared water resources for their livelihoods. The ISP contributed to the overall
progression of the NBI towards achieving its Shared Vision with the ultimate beneficiaries the
people of the basin. The project itself, because of its focus on building capacity and technical
tools, had limited opportunities for employment, income generation and poverty reduction.
However a key aspect of the project was integration of social development issues into project
preparation and implementation including social impact analysis, stakeholder consultation,
gender considerations, and resettlement action planning.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
The entire project was focused on institutional strengthening so this aspect is covered throughout
the report.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
The ISP, due to its provision of core financial support to NBI to fund the majority of management,
technical and administrative staff, enabled the implementation of the entire NBTF portfolio of ten
projects in addition to ISP with a combined value of US$90m as well as projects funded by other
donors. In recognition of this, ISP’s implementation support missions by the Bank reviewed
overall portfolio performance as part of assessing NBI’s strengthened performance. NBI
developed a simple high level management tool for quarterly portfolio monitoring which
identified progress with each project, issues arising, and actions required. This was effective in
raising issues for management attention and hence ensuring timely and appropriate
implementation.

The success by NELSAP-CU in the identification and preparation of investment projects of
regional significance generated more demand for action on the ground. In general, since the start
of NBI, expectations for investments were unrealistic in terms of the scale and time required.
Whilst the success supported NELSAP-CU to gain credibility and attract further resources, it also
required proactive management of expectations.




                                                                                                 31
4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating:24 Substantial
For NBI overall, there were some institutional risks which impacted on implementation of ISP
and will continue to affect the future of the institution. Some risks such as the evolving nature of
Nile Basin cooperation are beyond the influence of the institution. However this did not prevent
the ISP from achieving its objective of strengthening the institutional foundations. Although the
final nature of the permanent institution is not known, at the end of the ISP the NBI and its three
Centers were broadly considered to be ‘fit for purpose’ within the given mandates and have
gained much maturity within the ISP’s implementation timeframe.

External risks
 Fragmentation of Nile basin cooperation. The future political context for Nile cooperation
    remains uncertain following the break of consensus and partial signing of the Cooperative
    Framework Agreement (CFA). To date, six countries have signed the CFA and one has
    ratified. The establishment of NBI by all riparians was a historic achievement, and 13 years
    later, NBI continues to serve all its members. In particular NBI provides support through
    facilitating cooperation at a basin wide level, providing expert knowledge and services to
    countries for water resource management, providing project identification and preparation
    services to countries for water resource development – overall ensuring value added to
    countries, demonstrating the benefits of cooperation as well as the benefits of joint
    management of risks such as climate variability and change.

      Payment of member state contributions. Arrears have been substantial and whilst now
       reducing, this has implications for NBIs operations. The full and timely payment of
       contributions is paramount if NBI is to continue and grow as a sustainable institution.
       Donors consider these payments to be an indication of ownership and support, and after many
       years of financing of core costs, donors are expecting the riparians to now increase their
       financial commitment. Whilst currently each member state pays the same amount to NBI
       (depending only on its membership of the SAPs) and an overall plan to cover the costs of
       minimum functionality has been agreed by member states, discussions within the NileTAC
       have raised the possibility of differentiated contributions. This is not a new idea for the Nile
       Basin, with a cost sharing formula having first been proposed and agreed under TECONILE
       in 1992. However further discussion will be required, hopefully without disrupting the
       agreed trajectory to US$3.8m by 2017.

      Fragmentation of development partner support. The Nile Basin Trust Fund has provided an
       important mechanism for coordinated donor support to the NBI over the last ten years. This
       helpfully reduced the demand on NBI from multiple donors, multiple requirements, and
       potentially poor donor alignment at a crucial time in NBIs evolution. Whilst diversity of
       financing is a strength (and NBI especially the SAPs is increasingly achieving this), with the
       end of the NBTF there is a risk that donor support will become uncoordinated and fragmented.
       It will be important for NBI to encourage donors to align behind the Strategic Plan and
       Program Framework and to continue the effective coordination achieved to date through the
       annual Strategic Dialogue.




24
     Risk rating levels: High, Substantial, Modest, Low

                                                                                                    32
Internal risks
 Financial vulnerability. Until the NBI gains the increase in funding from member states and
    broadens the financial base, it is financially vulnerable. The new NBTF/CIWA project
    NCORE will support the first two years of transition from the majority of costs of minimum
    functionality covered by donor funded projects to greater member state funding. Mitigation
    is demonstration of results and the added value of NBI to member countries, as well as
    monitoring and reporting payments regularly to NileTAC.

   Maintaining momentum. All three Centers are operating with substantially less funding in
    2013 compared with previous years. This risks losing momentum with fewer activities in
    terms of scope and scale, and hence risks losing key expert staff. Senior NBI management
    with the support from TAC will need to be more proactive in marketing professional and
    appropriate project proposals to donors. The NBI’s annual Strategic Dialogue offers a forum
    for such engagement.

   Maintaining relevance. NBI is becoming a recognized center for knowledge about the Nile
    Basin but as yet this capability is yet to be maximized and exploited. It will be important for
    Member States to encourage and utilize this capacity as well as for NBI to broaden its
    outreach with greater access to information by the public. This would help NBI to strengthen
    its relevance and visibility across the basin, as well as bringing recognition of its growing
    capacity as a center of excellence.

   Managing countries expectations in fulfillment of program ambition. All member states are
    impatient for greater action on the ground to meet economic development and poverty
    reduction needs. Expectations in terms of available financing and timescale have been rather
    unrealistic since the start of NBI which unfortunately creates unfair dissatisfaction with NBIs
    performance. Mitigation, in form of clarifying the pace of development of substantial
    infrastructure investments as well as fund raising with development partners and investors to
    support implementation of the growing program is required.

   Staff retention. Unless NBI is a competitive employer in the region, experienced and well
    qualified staff may leave for better opportunities. This risks the capacity that has been
    achieved to date. Appropriate salaries and benefits, and equity between similar posts in the
    three Centers, is essential. Whilst ISP supported the development of a new NBI wide HR
    policy with a new salary and benefits scale, it has not been finalized. This needs urgent action
    with support from the TAC to ensure the result is appropriate and affordable for NBI in the
    long term.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory
The Bank performance during design and preparation of the project is rated as moderately
unsatisfactory, primarily because of the delays experienced during the first year of
implementation. The Bank team did have expertise and experience in preparing the project and
had very good relations with the NBI with enabled a good assessment of the needs and scope of
the project. The Banks knowledge of major international basins and previous operations in the
Nile Basin were used well to shape the design with a logical flow of outputs to outcome to
objective and appropriate components. However, a fundamental design flaw was the lack of

                                                                                                 33
capacity at the three Centers at effectiveness and the ambitious three year timescale and the lack
of time start-up to enable the lead organization, the NileSEC, to recruit the staff required for
implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank performance during supervision is rated as Satisfactory. The Bank team was supportive
and encouraging, as well as flexible to meet NBI’s requests. Examples include the Mid-Term
Review which was approached as a partnership between the Bank and NBI, supporting ENTRO
to cope with the loss of member state contributions from two of the three countries by approving
continued payment of salaries of the country funded posts and additional consultant support, and
responsiveness to amending approved annual work plans and budgets. At NBIs request, mission
teams were kept small to avoid over-powering the NBI with multiple and parallel meetings.
Fiduciary responsibilities were effectively carried out, with constructive support from the three
Bank country offices for financial management and procurement as well as the Bank colleagues
in TACT. Support for safeguards compliance was appropriate through engagement with NBI to
develop the environment and social policy and guidelines. With the NileTAC as the PSC,
briefings were provided by the TTL during the regular TAC meetings.

The independent evaluation in 2010 noted a perception of micro-management by the Bank and
delays in no objections although this was noted often to relate to quality issues and was resolved.
Other problems included a late decision on restructuring which resulted in considerable
uncertainty for NBI. This was regrettable, partially due to misunderstandings within the Bank
team on requirements for additional financing for a project with previously poor ratings.

Donor partners regularly joined Bank implementation support missions. CIDA was extremely
committed and proactive in supporting ISP throughout and particularly during the appraisal
mission and the MTR, supporting its preparation, facilitation, and largely contributing to ISPs
turning point.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The overall rating for Bank performance is assessed to be moderately satisfactory. The limitation
observed in the quality at entry was resolved at the MTR with a time extension and as a result did
not hinder the full achievement of the project. Supervision was generally considered appropriate
and supportive. As a supporting justification, when asked what factors contributed to ISPs
success, the NBI Executive Director was categorical in his recognition and appreciation of the
Banks support throughout ISP design and implementation, explaining that the Bank had a
thorough understanding of the NBI, its needs, strengths and weaknesses, and the actors, and
consequently was able to offer substantial support.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
For the purposes of the ICR, since ISP was a project for the Nile Basin Initiative - a partnership
by the governments of ten countries - the ‘government’ is taken to mean the NBI member
countries as represented by the Nile Technical Advisory Committee (NileTAC).

NileTAC was designated the ISP Project Steering Committee to provide strategic guidance during
ISP implementation. This reflected the core and broad nature of the ISP with its involvement in


                                                                                                  34
(and funding of) the majority of NBI’s core operations. Overall the PSC fulfilled its function,
providing adequate strategic guidance in the course of regular NBI business. This included
reviewing all key outputs such as the Core Functions, Strategic Plan, Financing Strategy, program
framework, policies, procedures and manuals as well as approving annual work plans and budgets.
Whilst the TAC guidance was paramount for a project of this nature, some concerns were raised
that it was not strategic enough and frequently delved into operational matters. This was only
partially mitigated by greater focus by the NileSEC on agenda setting with specific requests for
guidance.

The decision of TAC as PSC also reflected the desire to strengthen the ‘one basin, one NBI’
philosophy and mitigate the risk of fragmentation - with these issues raised during ISPs design
and noted in the PAD risk table. Mitigation was relatively successful, although recent debate
amongst TAC and staff did not agreed the hierarchy with NileTAC in relation to the SAP TACs.
This lack of agreed clarity of hierarchy and linkages between TACs has implications on the
clarity of linkages between Centers. For example, as noted by the IDS, the Executive Director of
ENTRO effectively reports as a courtesy to the Executive Director of NileSEC. In practice,
despite the lack of clear formal linkages, the Centers largely coordinate and cooperate effectively.
Some staff have noted occasions of differing guidance between TACs, but largely the SAP TACs
focus on the specifics of the SAP programs whilst NileTAC maintains an overview of NBI with
all the three Centers.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The implementing agency is the NBI and more specifically the three NBI Centers, noting that the
NileSEC was the overall designated lead for ISP. Performance is rated as satisfactory. Despite
the slow start up (which was partially a problem of design), the NBI successfully improved
performance and pace, implementing all the activities as planned and successfully achieving the
project outcomes and outputs (see Annex 2). In addition, the Centers effectively managed the
budget achieving 100% expenditure.

The NBI Task Team Leaders in each Centre worked well together coordinating ISP activities and
taking responsibility for agreed actions. Proactive support and guidance was also provided by the
three Centre Heads which substantially assisted the project to achieve its objective. In particular
the Centre Heads managed and mitigated risks and engaged the NileTAC to resolve any
outstanding issues.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall rating of the NBIs performance is satisfactory. This reflects the achievement of the
projects objective and its full expenditure despite the various challenges during implementation.
It also reflects the fact that despite initial capacity issues, the three Centers delivered a project that
is unlike anything ever attempted before by the NBI. The NBI staff were very appreciative of
ISPs support and what it had enabled them to achieve.

6. Lessons Learned
A number of lessons have been learned from the ISP, both project specific and of wide general
application for other basin organizations. Some of these lessons have already been taken into
account in the design of the Cooperation in International Waters in Africa (CIWA) trust fund for
example a long term commitment based on strategic objectives. Lessons have also been
discussed and taken up in other basins, such as by the Interim Secretariat of the Zambezi Basin
Commission through the planned support from CIWA.

Overarching lessons for basin engagement

1. Institutional strengthening is part of a continuum and requires a long term commitment.
   Bringing all countries together in a basin is a major institutional success which requires a
   long term commitment to support and sustain. The NBI was formed in 1999, and 13 years
   later whilst it is a much stronger institution, it still needs support if it is to sustain the gains
   achieved to date and continue to further strengthen cooperative water resources management
   and development. By the nature of regional cooperation, the last 13 years have not been
   without challenges, even more so in the last three years and particularly for ENTRO. Despite
   this, country commitment to cooperation has remained strong - as has donor commitment.
   The NBI is still relatively young when compared with other significant international basin
   organizations, and continued commitment is essential if the substantial and expected gains are
   to be realized. Building on the foundation achieved by ISP, the focus for NBI is now on
   consolidation and delivering results. This is articulated in the NBI Strategic Plan (figure 1)
   and formed the basic principle for the new NBTF/CIWA project NCORE.

2. It is essential to maintain a platform for basin-wide dialogue and to continue activities at a
   technical level in an uncertain political context for cooperation. The ISP provided core
   support to the NBI during a critical period – at the start in 2008 with the expectation of
   agreement of a new political framework for cooperation, mid-way through with uncertainty
   surrounding the political negotiations which resulted in a break of consensus in 2010, and
   then to completion in 2012 with NBI remaining as a transitional institution. This maintained
   a platform for member states to continue to meet and discuss NBI business including strategic
   direction, financial sustainability, policy developments and project progress. During most
   governance meetings all member countries were present and whilst some members opposed
   continued business discussions, the interaction was maintained. ISP also enabled technical
   activities across the NBI’s substantial portfolio to continue and delivery of NBI’s core
   functions to be strengthened. This continuity provided by the ISP maintained stability,
   enabled cooperation to continue, and mitigated some of the impact on the institution from the



                                                                                                    36
     challenging political context25. The success (partially attributed to ISP) is evidenced by the
     continued operations of ENTRO and the resumption of participation in regional NBI
     activities by one of the two countries. Overall now that NBI has a achieved a sound
     foundation and in particular has established the WRM Department with the world class Nile
     Basin DSS at the NileSEC, the focus is on strengthening the platform as a basis for dialogue
     on the key water management issues facing the basin.

3. River basin organizations need to ensure their relevance to member countries. This is a key
   principle for any regional institution owned by its member states. The role and added value
   should be explicit, with the regional institution only undertaking activities which cannot be
   undertaken by the individual countries. Overall whilst NBI was established by agreement of
   all member states, there is concern that this is faltering and potentially fragmenting as a result
   of losing relevance for some countries. NBI is one institution with three Centers, each
   forming an important part of the whole, with strength together, and respect for subsidiarity.
   The NileSEC has growing value as the center for basin-wide knowledge, NELSAP-CU has
   gained much appreciation from member states for its niche role in identification and
   preparation of investment projects of regional significance, and ENTRO has gained much
   value and appreciation for generating and sharing knowledge of the Eastern Nile basin
   particularly with academia. NBIs future should aim to ensure that the countries value NBI as
   a platform where they can be informed and freely debate issues of relevance for cooperative
   basin management and development.

4. The principles of and the approach to financial sustainability should be defined and agreed
   at the start. ISP introduced the concept of ‘minimum functionality’ defined as the minimum
   level of staff, operations and activities required to maintain the basic functioning of the
   institution. This was costed, with overall NBI requiring US$3.8million a year. In comparison
   member state contributions26 were expected to be US$690,000 a year (18%) with the shortfall
   funded by donors. A briefing paper was developed and presented to the NileTAC explaining
   the financial vulnerability of the NBI with a request to increase member state contributions to
   cover the minimum functionality. This was subsequently endorsed by NileCOM in July 2012,
   with the first step increase scheduled for July 2013 and attaining 100% in five years, Figure 2.
   This approach was fundamental in changing the basis for NBI’s financial sustainability.
   Until member countries fully implement the agreed plan, NBI remains vulnerable and reliant
   on donor support. A linked lesson is the need for continuity of donor support to enable the
   transition to financial sustainability. The ISP successor project NCORE provides this for the
   first two years, but thereafter the NBI currently has a substantial financing gap.




25
  For example at ENTRO, since two of the three member states were not paying country contributions,
some staff were fully transferred to ISPs budget so that activities across the program could continue.

26
 This is the expected contribution. At the time, actual contributions were lower since two countries were
not paying contributions due to a freeze in NBI activities, and some countries were in arrears with
payments.

                                                                                                         37

5. Strengthening a regional institution is not a straight forward linear process. It requires
   flexibility to maximize the value of support to meet needs of the institution, particularly when
   the institution operates within a complex political context. ISP provided substantial support
   across the whole of NBI, from funding the governance meetings and technical staff, to
   developing policies and programs, to harmonizing financial systems. Whilst this extent of
   support was challenging and risky for NBI (since ISP encompassed virtually everything and
   everyone), it also provided flexibility. At the start of ISP, the flexibility was overwhelming
   and progress was slow partly due to a lack of clarity about what ISP was aiming to achieve.
   The turning point was NBI’s self-evaluation and clarification of the core functions with a
   division of responsibilities between the SEC and SAPs facilitated during the Mid-Term
   Review in early 2011. This also took stock of the risks and made appropriate adjustments, in
   particular focusing on strengthening NBI as a transitional institution although discussions on
   the shape of the potential future institution continued. A key aspect of institutional
   strengthening success was supporting the NBI to learn and grow from the inside.

6. Mutual dependency and limitations of institutional strengthening and organizational
   strengthening27. The ISP provided both institutional strengthening for the NBI as a whole
   and organizational strengthening for each of the three Centers, figure 3. Institutional
   strengthening included the support to NBI to clarify its core functions, to build financial
   sustainability, to improve integration between the three Centers, to develop basin-wide
   policies, to review the possible future institutional options, to move from a project to a
   program approach, and to bring greater knowledge to the member countries. Organizational


27
  A working definition of institutional strengthening is the reinforcement of a network of organizations to
effectively generate, allocate and use human, material and financial resources to attain specific objectives
on a sustainable basis. A pre-requisite for institutional strengthening is that the organization is capable of
executing the required activities. Organizational strengthening concentrates on improving this
organizational capacity. It can be defined as the measures to improve the performance of an organization
to execute selected activities.


                                                                                                             38
      strengthening included the support to each Centre to improve its performance and capacity
      including its organizational structure and its planning, management and monitoring systems,
      guidelines and procedures. Overall whilst both were successful, there were limitations to
      what could be achieved particularly for institutional strengthening. As a project within the
      overall NBI institution, albeit a substantial and fundamental one, ISP did not manage to
      improve the effectiveness of the overall NBI structure in particular the linkages between the
      governing bodies28 (the TACs) and formalizing the related linkages between the Centers29.
      This was partly due to the political context where decisions on structure were considered
      inappropriate prior to the transition to a permanent institution.

7. Overall approach of the NBTF support to NBI. Since the start of the NBTF funding to the
   NBI in 2003, a total of twenty eight projects (with twenty eight grant agreements) have been
   implemented with one ongoing, of total value US$183 million. This has required substantial
   management by NBI and also by the Bank Nile team. Whilst this approach can be considered
   as fragmented, it was appropriate to the initial context of engaging countries across the basin
   and flexible within the evolving context. In future, now that NBI has gained capacity and
   maturity, a larger comprehensive project may be more suitable providing greater
   predictability of financing. This is the plan under the Nile Basin Climate Resilient Growth
   Program – with a phase 1 project currently under implementation (NCORE $15m over 2
   years) and a larger longer duration phase 2 under discussion.



28
  The need for clarification of linkages was noted in the original ISP design documents from 2007 and was
highlighted by the Institutional Design Study (IDS). Whilst there was much discussion by the TAC about
the IDS recommendations, as well as follow on workshops to further explore the issues, decisions were
deferred to a later date.
29
  ENTRO has a loose formal connection with the Nile Secretariat despite both being an integral part of
NBI. In practice, ENTRO and NileSEC coordinate and communicate as required, but this has often caused
some tensions due to differing expectations.

                                                                                                      39
8. Importance of continuity of support by Development Partners. The long term engagement by
   Development Partners through the NBTF and the broader partnership has been important to
   support the NBI through its inception and strengthening, despite the broader challenges of
   Nile cooperation. Partners appreciated the need for long term engagement in the basin and
   for predictability to enable continuity of the institution and its human resources. With a short
   term focus, the risks may have been too high and the many achievements would have been
   jeopardized – including the achievement of the long term Shared Vision of the basin. Whilst
   there is still a long way to go, Member States and Partners continue to be committed to
   achieving this vision.

Project specific lessons

9. The project duration for institutional strengthening should have been longer. ISP was
   designed with a three year duration. With the slow start up (due to capacity deficits at the lead
   Centre which should have been foreseen), two key studies were delayed which had knock-on
   efforts throughout the project implementation. The MTR recommended a time extension that
   enabled the NBI to satisfactory complete the project. In general, institutional strengthening
   operations should be of sufficient duration to allow for reflection and self-learning as part of
   strengthening.

10. Retention of core staff on short term contracts. All staff supported by the ISP were employed
    as World Bank consultants on contracts with a duration of one year and renewal based on
    satisfactory performance. The short term duration was a concern for staff with seemingly
    little assurance of employment continuity. It was also a management burden for NBI and the
    Bank team, requiring no objections for over 50 contracts every year. Particularly with an
    institutional strengthening project, every effort should be made to integrate the project into
    the long term operations of the institution, including for staff.

11. Bank support to regional projects with multiple locations could be streamlined to improve
    efficiency. The ISP with its operations in three countries required support from three World
    Bank country offices particularly for financial management and procurement. Whilst some
    of the challenges were overcome through good coordination, having a different specialist for
    each Centre often provided different advice and did not enable effective comparison between
    Centers or learning across them. One financial management and one procurement specialist
    for the project overall would have improved the consistency and hence effectiveness of Bank
    support to the NBI.

12. Adequacy of World Bank supervision capacity and resources. The ISP was not a regular
    Bank project in a single country location. ISP implementation support required visits to all
    three Centers to individually assess progress and review issues, followed by a joint meeting
    of the three Centers together to review findings overall and to agree actions. In addition, to
    brief the PSC, attendance was required at the NileTAC meetings. This was time and resource
    intensive. The ISP as well as other projects funded from the NBTF benefited from the
    flexibility of supervision costs which enabled adequate supervision budgets.

Notes
1
  Actual figures are higher than estimated for member state contributions due to the extension of the project
by 8 months. Overall contributions during ISP were less than expected due to the non-payment of
contributions by two member countries during their freeze in participation in NBI activities and the arrears
accumulated by others. As of May 2013, arrears amount to US$848,000. The countries in arrears are
Burundi, DRC, Egypt and Sudan.
2
    The BMZ contribution is made in Euro so these figures are equivalents.

 The SVP Confidence Building and Stakeholder Involvement Project continued in parallel with ISP for
several months until its closure in 2009. It was nominally considered as part of ISP as its activities were
mainstreamed.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
Economic analysis
As an institutional strengthening project, ISP does not lend itself to standard efficiency evaluations (net
present value, economic rate of return, cost-benefit analysis, or measuring actual costs against a
benchmark). The economic justification of the project lies in its facilitating role in the generation of
economic benefits throughout the basin through sustainable management and cooperative development.
The project initiated NBI’s knowledge-based integrated water resource management function, and so will
facilitate sustainable water planning built around basin-wide benefit sharing strategies. It is expected that
in the longer term NBI will be able to develop a full basin sustainability function, delivering real
environmental benefits and creating the framework for optimal basin-wide planning and the development
of water resources. The project has also strengthened NBI’s capability to deliver development projects,
resulting in direct economic benefits to the riparians through investment financing. Overall the project
was implemented within its budget and successfully achieved its outcomes and outputs.

The nature and extent of the longer term benefits to be drawn from basin-wide cooperation are hard to
quantify, but they include direct economic benefits, environmental benefits, and political benefits. Direct
economic benefits result from more efficient use of water, and hence greater outputs in sectors such as
irrigation and hydropower. Direct economic benefits will also accrue from progressive regional
integration, which will result in increased productivity and increased transboundary trade. Environmental
benefits will stem from greater conservation, and more sustainable use of environmental systems. The
improved management of environmental goods resulting from cooperative Nile water management and
development will certainly provide economic benefits, such as reduced erosion and siltation. Finally,
political benefits include increased stability and diminished tensions, and the consequent peaceful
environment within which economies are more likely to thrive.

Financial analysis
The project was fully financed through a combination of grants (multi-donor NBTF and parallel bilateral
support by BMZ/GIZ) and member state contributions. The Bank’s administration of ISP funds through
the NBTF ensured a unified and coherent approach to fund management and efficient disbursement
mechanisms. NBI had considerable experience of these mechanisms and generally of Bank procedures
from previous projects. The disbursement of member state contributions was generally efficient, although
there was some slow payments and build-up of arrears. There was a well-established disbursement
mechanism between the NBI and GIZ although with GIZ directly managing approximately 2/3rds of the
funds.
The budget and expenditure status of ISP was reviewed, table 1. Of the NBTF ISP grant of US$24.02m,
expenditure to 31 December 2012 is US$24.02m (100%) which has now been fully accounted. This is a
significant achievement.

ENTRO had a slight underspend due to funds retained in case a further meeting of ENSAPT or ENCOM
is scheduled before the end of the year. Other related budget items such as for the recruitment of the three
senior staff were re-allocated to maximize use of funds.

NELSAP-CU had an extremely tight budget for the last year with expenditure on activities decreasing due
to lack of budgetary resources, not due to need or ability to implement or spend. NELSAP-CU’s budget
management was considered exemplary over the last 18 months, particularly considering the challenges
of the ISPs tight budget and the workload demands of the seven other NBTF projects as well as other
donor projects.

 Financial year expenditure over the duration of ISP is shown, table 2. Average annual expenditure for
 ISP at each Centre was Nile-SEC US$2.8m, ENTRO US$1.3m, and NELSAP-CU US$1.5 m. For the
 SAPs, this was slightly more than the cost of minimum functionality indicating how ISP has funded the
 core costs of the organization including key technical posts, with the project related financing on top.
 This is the model for Member State contributions to cover the minimum functionality and Development
 Partners to fund projects. The Nile-SEC’s average annual expenditure was US$1m over their cost of
 minimum functionality, partially resulting from the additional work undertaken for NBI as a whole, such
 as the IDS study, HR study, hosting the Strategic Dialogue & NBTF Committee meetings, corporate
 communications as well as overall ISP management.

  The FY10 budget for Nile-SEC is substantially higher than other years due to a US$1.8 million payment to
 UNOPS for the SVP Management Services Agency contract. Of the 9 SVP projects, 7 closed in December 2009.

Annex 7. Summary of Grantee's ICR
Extract from NBI Project Completion Report for ISP

The Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP) was designed to strengthen the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI)
so that it would be well placed to ensure proper adaptation to the changing regional environment. With
the anticipated scaling up of Subsidiary Action Programs’ (SAP) activities, a more robust NBI was
needed to face the larger and more sophisticated challenges and to support international good practice in
project preparation and implementation. Yet NBI still lacked the institutional depth to perform this
important function: core staffing was thin, especially at the Nile-SEC, relative to the size of the NBI’s
work program and insufficient to respond to the increasing and emerging demands placed on the
institution. The three NBI Centers still needed institutional support to advance their mandates effectively.
In addition, the development of regional databases and capacity to analyze water resource information
were still in their infancy; and stakeholder engagement and communication functions also required further
strengthening.

 In addition, ISP provided an opportunity for NBI to consolidate and sustain the gains that had been made
under the Shared Vision Program (SVP). ISP provided the much needed program continuity after the SVP
came to an end; the SVP outputs were well mainstreamed into the Nile Basin Initiative. Without ISP,
there was a clear risk that these could have been lost. ISP was designed in a period of optimism that the
Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) would be signed in its life time; hence the need for NBI to
prepare for a future permanent institution with or without the CFA. Although there were delays in signing
the CFA, which led to uncertainty; this did not have a significant impact on effective achievement of the
ISP development objective.

The project development objective was “The NBI has strengthened foundation for institutional
sustainability, enhanced capacity, and harmonized corporate management to more effectively deliver
programs and projects.?

Assessment of overall ISP performance
Overall, ISP fully achieved its development objective; a strengthened institutional foundation for NBI to
deliver its core functions, underpinned by member state commitment to finance minimum functionality.
This is a significant achievement for a complex, regional, three Centre institutional strengthening project
within a relatively short timeframe of 4 years. There were challenges, it was not perfect but NBI did what
was possible given the uncertainties at the time. Overall expenditure of the NBTF grant was US$ 24.014
out of fund allocation of USD 24.02 million 99.9%,
The project is rated satisfactory for achievement of the Project Development Objective and
Implementation Progress. This demonstrates the substantial progress achieved and retained since Mid
Term Review (MTR) with the ratings upgraded successively from Moderately Unsatisfactory to
Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory at the July 2012 and final closing reviews.
At Centre level, overall achievements are:
       Nile Secretariat was strengthened to be a viable basin wide institution, serving as a platform for
        dialogue for Nile Basin countries and building knowledge for cooperative water resources
        management of the shared resources
       NELSAP-CU was strengthened to be a viable regional institution for catalyzing and enabling
        water resources management and development investments, reinforcing country commitment to
        regional cooperation
       ENTRO was strengthened to be a viable regional office for cooperative water resources
        management and development and to serve as a platform for consultation and consensus building
        for Eastern Nile countries

                                                                                                         59
Finances and procurement
Of the total NBTF funds allocation of USD 24.02, a total of USD 24.014 was spent representing 99.9%.
About 80% of government of Germany funding contribution to this project was directly disbursed
through GIZ. Cash contributions from member states to this project increased from 1.9 to USD 2.6 on
account of the project extension period to 4 years.

Finance systems across NBI were upgraded, an NBI wide finance manual was revised, approved and is
operational. All procurements were executed in accordance with the World Bank Procurement Guidelines
and NBI’s Procurement and Disposal Manual. The Procurement staff in the NBI centres underwent on job
training at different times to improve their capabilities in administering contracts. In addition, the NBI
procurement manual was revised and updated in line with the latest World Bank procurement guidelines.
All procurements were guided by the procurement plans which were updated on quarterly basis. Post
Procurement Reviews conducted by World Bank noted a general improvement in the procurement
processes at Nile SEC, and all activities that required special procurement were completed.

Sustainability
The ISP strengthened the foundations for institutional sustainability. Whilst still dependent on donor
funding for the majority of core function costs over the last ten years, this is now set to change over the
next five years. Member states have committed to funding minimum functionality and this underpins
sustainability, as well as signaling ownership and recognition of NBI’s value. This decision by NileCOM,
once implemented will reduce dependence on donors. In addition, clarity of functions, better technical
capacity, improved policies procedures and systems and better communications enables effective
marketing and facilitates fund raising. For 2013 and beyond, NBI has attracted funding from trust funds,
bilateral donors and multi-lateral banks, including NBTF/CIWA, BMZ, SIDA, AfDB, EIB, and
Netherlands.

The achievements of ISP will be immediately taken forward by the new NBTF/CIWA Nile Cooperation
for Results (NCORE) project, ensuring continuity and enabling NBI to further build on its institutional
foundations to deliver its core functions.

Challenges in the project design
    There was lack of clarity on respective roles and responsibilities of the 3 NBI Centers
    There was insufficient start-up lead time to get SEC staffed to start delivery of project, with too
       short a timeframe for an ambitious project.
    Complexity and ambiguity of certain outputs; ISP had no PIP to guide implementation, process
       rather than a project was not clearly understood.
    The Nile Technical Advisory Committee (Nile TAC), the governing body, was also the Project
       Steering Committee. It was then difficult to determine where the respective mandates started and
       stopped.
Implementation Challenges
    The hydro political situation in the Basin remained unresolved; this constituted the major external
      challenge.
    Non-payment and or delayed payments of country contributions posed a challenge during the
      project period; and as such NBI could not achieve one of its impact indicators to cover 50% costs
      of its core staff.

Lessons learnt in project design and implementation

Project design
    It is important to separate of roles of the project steering Committees from those of Governance
    Integrate lead time for project startup activities in project planning and design

Project implementation
    There is need for financial sustainability and having minimum functionality defined early on in
        the life of an institution.
    Need for resilience and adaptability in face of changing political circumstances.
    Managing the technical mandate in a highly political environment, aware that the technical
        mandate of NBI, and the economic context is undertaken within a political environment – hence
        need for flexibility, continuous management oversight, having creativity within a “firewall?
        between the two. This enables recognizing the likely political difficulties even before they occur.
    Need for continuous and close management oversight of project implementation to ensure that
        corrective measures are taken in good time.
    Managing expectations within the riparian countries to avoid frustration and potential loss of
        interest when timescales for delivery are longer.
Assessment of NBI performance
    The project is rated satisfactory for achievement of the Project Development Objective and
        Implementation Progress. This demonstrates the substantial progress achieved and retained since
        Mid Term Review (MTR) with the ratings upgraded successively from Moderately
        Unsatisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory to Satisfactory at the July 2012 and final closing
        reviews.

Assessment of Development Partner performance
    Overall Satisfactory because appropriate technical guidance to implement a complex project was
       provided, there was responsiveness and flexibility to support implementation, there was effective
       liaison between NBI and NBTF partners (through the annual Strategic Dialogue), and general
       smooth funds flow. However some delays in decisions making by the World Bank such as
       approval of ISP time extension were experienced.


NBI Comments on the ICR report
Overall it is a good report, well written, captures the key issues and reflects our discussions, views and
issues.

Annex 8. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)
A project progress review of GIZ support to NBI was conducted between March and May 2013, which
highlighted:
     the overall positive impact of the ISP on NBI’s institutional strength, including member countries’
        commitment to increase self-financing
     the political risks to NBI and Nile cooperation, and the need to further build trust and confidence
        among the riparian countries
     the need to better link the regional NBI processes with national level planning and decision
        making, to increase NBI’s visibility and demonstrate concrete benefits of cooperation to member
        states
     an overall positive assessment of the GIZ-NBI project’s results and implementation, with most
        outcomes achieved
     the good working relation with the World Bank team and close coordination of GIZ support with
        the NBTF funded components of the ISP
     the appreciation by NBI and World Bank of the flexibility that GIZ support provided to meet
        demands that were arising during project implementation
     the need for continued coordination of development partners’ support to NBI under the NBI
        programmatic framework 2013-2017.

GIZ is currently preparing a new phase of support to NBI on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for
Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).

Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)
The report is very informative and provides very accurate narrative and unbiased assessment of the
Institutional Strengthening Project (ISP) from inception to end. While the tone of the report is very
positive and optimistic about the impact of the project in the future of the NBI it does, in a very nice way,
reflects on the challenges faced by the project at the World Bank level and the NBI itself. It is also noted
that the report incorporated comments and concerns address by CIDA during implementation review
missions.

Throughout the document it is clear the impact that changes proposed at the mid-term review had in the
improvement of project performance; which is in fact modestly stated. One critical success factor that
was also key in the advancement of the project from the start of the mid-term review to project end was
the World Bank Task Team Leader’s knowledge and experience on the subject, the partners (both
Development Partners, NBI and World Bank) and the region; and recommend that this is acknowledged
in the report considering the importance of a project manager competencies in the success of any project.

Lastly the quality of the information and the report itself is very good leaving very little room to
recommend any substantial changes to the document.

In general, CIDA should be pleased with the report and the accomplishment of the ISP; although there are
still concerns about the sustainability of the organization, the geopolitics of the region and the fulfillment
of the member countries’ commitments, both financially and continued cooperation in the sustainable
management and development of the basin.
