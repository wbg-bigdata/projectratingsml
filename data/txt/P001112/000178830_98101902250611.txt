REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE BANQUE IVOIRIENNE DE DEVELOPPEMENT INDUSTRIEL
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF
THE REPUBLIC OF THE IVORY COAST
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Banque Ivoirienne de Developpement Industriel (BIDI) with the
guarantee of the Republic of the Ivory Coast for the equivalent of US$8
million. The loan would bear interest at 8.5 percent per annum. BIDI would
relend the proceeds of the loan to Ivorian enterprises for up to 15 years
with an interest rate of not less than 11 percent per annum. Amortization
of the loan would substantially conform to the aggregate of the amortization
schedules applicable to the investment projects financed out of the proceeds
of the loan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report on the Ivory Coast, Report No. 296 -
IVC "Current Economic Situation and Prospects of the Ivory Coast", April 11,
1974 which is based on the findings of an economic mission in April of 1973,
confirmed the country's favorable growth prospects and its creditworthiness.
It concluded also that the Government's development efforts required and
deserved continued external support. While recent developments in export
and import prices have led to substantial quantitative changes in the balance
of payments estimates from those made in the report, our revised calculations
still support these conclusions. Annex I contains basic country data.
3.        Throughout the 1960's the Ivory Coast's economic growth was rapid.
GDP grew at an annual rate of 7.5 percent in real terms and in 1972 per
capita income reached US$340. Although this growth rate could not be fully
sustained in the early 1970's because of deteriorating terms of trade and
adverse weather conditions, growth in 1971-74 still averaged 6 percent a
year, in real terms. Factors contributing to rapid growth were the Govern-
ment's liberal and pragmatic economic policies which have made the country
attractive to foreign investors, the availability of ample land and timber
resources, the existence of a large pool of labor including immigrants from
sahelian countries and, during the late sixties, rising commodity export
prices. Recognizing the country's vulnerability in its dependence on three
export commodities (cocoa, coffee and wood constitute about 75 percent of
total exports while exports are some 32 percent of GDP), the Government began
after 1965 to diversify agriculture by introducing or expanding oil palm,
coconut, pineapple, rice, rubber, cotton and sugar cultivation and by
placing more emphasis on other economic sectors such as industry, mining
and tourism. Although the full benefits of these diversification efforts
are still some years off, the prospects are that the Ivory Coast will grad-
ually become less dependent on its traditional exports.



4.        The Government's clevelopment objectives include, in addition to
broadening the production base, the extension of economic infrastructure in
such fields as transport and power, the improvement of urban facilities,
regional diversification, the developmient of seconcary industrial centers,
the development of education and the Ivorianization of the economy. These
objectives correspond well to the needs and the possibilities of the country.
Past and ongoing development has laid a solid foundation for further growth.
5.        The Government's awareness of social problems is reflected in the
current (1971-1975) Plan's emphasis on the income effects of development,
regional balance and education. Thus, to reduce inequalities, recent salary
raises have been graded down from 26 percent for the lowest to 5 percent for
the higher paid workers.   A number of projects, for instance, cocoa, rice,
oil palm, rubber, sugar and cotton are designed to narrow the gap between
urban and rural incomes and to reduce regional income disparities.    In the
same vein, over the past five years, the Government has increased producer
prices for cocoa by 120 percent, for coffee by 60 percent and for cotton by
35 percent.
6.        However, the next Plan (1976-80) will need to focus more sharply
still on problems of urbanization, prospects for emnloyment in both rural
and urban areas and income distribution. To assist the Government in these
directions a special Bank employment mission, which included ILO staff,
visited the Ivory Coast. The mission's report "Ivory Coast: Special
Report on Employment" (Report No. 279 IVC) was issued in July 1974, after
detailed discussions with the Government.   The mission identified the em-
ployment problem as one of growing imbalances: while projected demand
for labor appears to be matched by manpower supply (including immigration)
shortages in rural areas and a surplus in urban labor marlets will develop
in the absence of corrective action. The mission also singled out a number
of issues for further study, including the costs and benefits of creating
a better economic and social infrastructure in secondary centers combined
with a certain degree of industrialization and suggested chanaes in educa-
tional and training systems.
7.        To assist the Government in the orientation of its industrial
policy, a Bank: mission, including a UNIDO staff member, prepared the report,
"Current Stattus and Prospects of the Industrial Sector in the Ivory Coast"
(Report No. 553-IVC), which was issued in February 1975 after detailed dis-
cussions with the Government. The mission calculated that local raw material
processing and import substitution industries contributed equally to the im-
pressive sectoral growth in real terms of 15 percent per year during the
1960-1973 period. As pursuing import substitution m.uch further may be costly
to the economy, the mission supported the recent change in Government policy
encouraging industrial exports and recommended modification of the Investment
Code accorclingly. The mission agreed with the Government that Ivorianization
in terms of capital and labor of the, at present, largely foreign-owned manu-
facturing sector shouldl have high priority. Future growth prospects were
evaluated favorably by the mission, but with a lasting worldwide   economic
slowdown  a downward adjustment is probably required here.



-3-
8.        Our forecasts show that after the recent changes in the commodity
price structure successful implementation of the Government's development
program will more than in the past depend on the availability of foreign
funds. Until recently, most Ivorian export products have been in strong
demand. Therefore, in 1974, higher export earnings more than compensated for
higher import outlays, resulting in a US$88 million balance of payments sur-
plus after three consecutive years of deficit. However, current Bank commodity
price forecasts point to a deterioration of the Ivory Coast's terms of trade.
In 1974, already, timber exports have dropped markedly as a direct consequence
of a slump in the European construction industry. Yet, the import bill will
continue to rise rapidly because of high inflation rates in supplier countries,
especially for investment goods, fertilizers and oil. The net oil import bill
went up from US$15 million in 1972 to US$90 million in 1974 and is expected
to be of the same magnitude in 1975, an increase from 3 percent of 1972 com-
modity imports to 7.5 percent in 1975. The Government has taken vigorous
action to limit the impact of higher imports on the country's balance of pay-
ments. For instance retail prices of petroleum products, electricity, rice,
sugar and other consumer products have been increased sharply, while the pro-
ducer price for rice has been doubled to encourage local production. The
country's first sugar mill started operating in April 1975. Its production
will replace 50,000 tons of sugar imports and roughly meet current domestic
demand. These and similar efforts in other lines of production will permit
a reduction in the share of food imports from its 1973 level of about 20
percent of total commodity imports.
9.        Despite all this, the trade surplus is expected to dwindle and it
will no longer compensate for the deficit in non-factor services, as it did
in the past. Consequently, and in contrast to the 1965-1970 period when the
Ivory Coast enjoyed a resource surplus of US$35 million per year on average,
a resource gap of US$80-100 million per year in the second half of the 197Q's
appears inevitable. This is equivalent to about 2.5 percent of projected GDP
or about 5.5 percent of projected exports and non-factor services in 1975.
As in the past, with interest payments, transfers of profits and workers'
remittances abroad, the factor services account will continue to be in def-
icit as well. Therefore, to maintain balance of payments equilibrium there
will have to be a substantial compensatory inflow of capital from abroad.
The Government may have to draw on the Oil Facility again as it did in 1974
for an amount of US$13.3 million. Indications of a possible discovery of
offshore oil are interesting in this respect, but too premature to be taken
into account at this stage. Central Bank reserves at the end of 1974 stood
at about US$65 million, which is equivalent to 3.5 weeks of 1974 commodity
imports.
10.       Based on past experience and assuming an adequate inflow of
capital, Ivory Coast's economy may be expected to adjust to changing world
economic conditions. Early in 1974, the Government established a task force
to advise on short term adjustments; the need for structural changes is being
given particular attention in the preparation of the new Five-Year Plan.
Good growth prospects in several sectors should facilitate the adoption of



- 4 -
corrective measures. For example, Ivory Coast has substantial potential to
increase electricity generation from hydro-sources.    According to the Govern-
ment's program, an estimated 85 percent of Ivorian (lemand for electricity
would be met from hydro-electric plants by the early eighties against 40
percent at present.
11.       Structural changes will take time and imply the continuation of a
sizeable investment effort. In recent years gross investment averaged about
21 percent of GDP, and the proportion of the public sector in total invest-
ments increased from an average of 50 percent in 1965-70 to 60 percent in
1970-73.  Public investments for 1975 are estimated at about US$500 million.
This amount would have to double in current prices between 1975 and 1980,
in order to maintain the investment rate necessary to achieve a growth of
GDP by 6 percent per year in real terms.
12.       Domestic public savings in the future are likely to cover a smaller
part of capital outlays than they did in the past, even assuming continued
good fiscal performance.   With budget revenues alreadv exceeding 20 percent
of GDP, future Government resources cannot reasonably be expected to increase
much faster than the economy as a whole. The Government has been quite suc-
cessful in generating budgetary savings but with rapidly increasing social
expenditures, for instance for housing and education, these savings will be
under heavy pressure.   To some extent savings from public enterprises will
provide some relief to the budgetary constraint. Revenues of the Stabiliza-
tion Fund for agricultural products fluctuate with world market prices and
as it is the Government's policy to pass more of commodity export earnings to
farmers, this source of public savings is unlikely to expand. Therefore, it
will require considerable effort from the Government to continue to finance
out of local public savings after debt service--which in the past financed
40 to 50 percent of public investments--not less than 25 to 30 percent of
public investments in the next five years. Thus at least 70 percent of
public investments will have to be financed from other sources.
13.       The chances that additional domestic private funds could be raised
to finance public investments remain low for two main reasons.     First, tradi-
tionally part of the profits made by foreign investors has been transferred
abroad and this will continue in the future. Second, non-Ivorian labor--it
is estimated that between 25 and 30 percent of the Ivory Coast population
is non-Ivorian--transferrecl about US$100 million to their home countries as
workers' remittances in 1974. Direct controls to limit private transfers are
not permitted within the Franc zone of which the Ivory Coast is the most im-
portant member in Africa; such controls would probahlv be counter-productive
as they would deter the iniflow of foreign private capital, and they would
represent a serious blow to the Ivory C-'ast's much- poorer neighbors, especially
Upper Volta, which receives about 40 percent of immigrant workers' remittances.
But these transfers, of course, mean a substantial drain on domestic savings
for the Ivory Coast.    Steps by the Government to raise interest rates, establish
a local stock market and p:Lace more emphasis on Ivorianization of the economy



- 5 -
are not likely to alter these flows sulstantially in thXe medium term.    Govern-
ment bonds issued with a tax free return of 7 to 10 percent have had only
moderate success so far.
14.       Absorptive capacity in terms of projects to be financed in the
public sector is substantial. The inflow of foreign loan capital into the
public sector in 1974 was about US$215 million: in 1975 it may need to be as
high as US$325 million. Assuming that 40 to 50 percent of future foreign
capital requirements will continue to be provided by international organiza-
tions and foreign governments and the rest by more expensive sources like
suppliers credit and private banks, the debt service ratio would rise from
its rather low level of 6.6 percent in 1973 to around 15 percent in the
early 1980's. W4e consider this level to be manageable. If the capital
required cannot be obtained on appropriate terms, the investment program
would have to be cut back and overall growth would drop below 6 percent.
The projected average contribution of net public savings to the financing
of public investments (paragraph 12), will in many cases be less than the
local cost component of projects. Therefore foreign donors should be will-
ing to finance not only the foreign cost component of projects but also some
local costs in those projects where the foreign exchange component is low.
15.       A basic economic mission, which visited the country in June/July
1975, has evaluated the country's long-term prospects in the context of the
draft 1976 to 1980 Development Plan, and is undertaking a thorough reexamina-
tion of the Bank's projections, the underlying assumptions and especially the
consequences for Ivory Coast's external borrowing and debt service. However,
there is little reason to believe that there will be much, if any, reduction
in the higher level of capital requirements now foreseen. The terms of
borrowing therefore become a more important consideration. If, for instance,
all supplementary needs for future capital were to be met on terms offered in
the Eurodollar market--to which the Ivory Coast has access--the debt service
ratio could substantially exceed the level of 15 percent projected for the
1980's. To keep debt service within manageable limits and to enable the
Government to implement its development policy, it is desirable that foreign
capital be made available on as concessionary terms as possible, including
long repayment and grace periods. In view of the still low debt service
ratio, the good future growth potential of the economy and the expected
increase in export earnings, the Ivory Coast remains creditworthy for substan-
tial additional borrowing from the Bank.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THE IVORY COAST
16.       Since 1968 the Bank's lending to the Ivory Coast has expanded rapidly
and now includes twenty-one loans totalling US$245.7 million and an IDA credit
of US$7.5 million. Eleven of these twenty-two operations have been for agricul-
ture: for the development of cotton, cocoa, rubber, oil palm and coconut



- 6 -
production and the construction of two oil mills: there were five road pro-
jects; the remaining six loans were for education, telecommunications, the
Abidjan sewerage and drainage system, tourism development and small scale
enterprises. IFC's small participation in the Banque Ivoirienne de Developpe-
ment Industriel (US$204,000) was increased in 1974 by a 50 percent stock
dividend. Annex II contains a summary statement of Banlk Group operations
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects, with particular reference to
those which are encountering problems in execution and giving rise to delays
in disbursements.
17.       The agricultural sector, including forestry, remains the principal
foreign exchange earner and domestic employer. It continues to provide close
to 90 percent of exports, to employ a majoritv of the population, to help
stabilize an increasingly mobile population, and to bring development to
remote areas of the country. Our principal efforts are, therefore, in this
sector. lWe have appraised early this year, with the Caisse Centrale de
Cooperation Economique (CCCE), a rice project in the forest zone of the Ivory
Coast.  Discussion of certain fiscal and marketing issues with the Government
held up processing of this project; a small mission is presently in the field
to supplement the findings of the appraisal mission. To assist the Govern-
ment's policy towards balanced regional growth and income distribution, we
are considering further oil palm, coconut and rulbber projects in the Southwest
of the Ivory Coast and a livestock development project and a followup project
to the Cotton Areas Rural Development Project in the North.
18.       In order to strengthen the country's major transport axes and link
the agricultural areas to the nation's urban centers and ports, we have placed
considerable emphasis on transport and have become the principal lender for
road construction and maintenance. We have thus far financed five road
projects totalling US$94.3 million. The first project was completed in
December 1974 with final costs within appraised estimates. After an initial'
delay caused by alignment modification and subsequent poor work organization,
the second project is expected to be completed later this year. The third
and fourth highway projects incurred substantial cost overruns which the
Government is expected to cover, otherwise execution is proceeding satisfac-
torily. The Bank was also closely associated, as executing agency, with the
1969 UNDP Transport Survey of the Ivory Coast; we will again act as executing
agency for updating of this survey which will serve as a basis for determining
future priority among transport investments. The fifth highway project, which
was signed on September 5, will substantially complete the primary road net-
work of the country; this will allow a shift in emphasis in the future to
secondary and feeder roads. A feeder road project is under preparation.
While the Bank is expected to continue to play a major role in the transport
sector, we hope that in the future its financing will increasingly be shared
with other sources of funds.   The Government has requested our assistance in
financing the improvement of a section of the Abidian-Ouagadougou rail line;
other sections of the rail line are being financed by FED and EIB.
19.       The education system of the Ivory Coast has not been adequate to
support its rapid economic development and the shortage of skilled manpower



-7-
has required employment of high-cost foreign technical and managerial personnel.
The Bank is closely associated with the Government's efforts to modernize its
education system, principally at the secondary and vocational levels. The
Bank's Second Education Project, which was signed in June 1975, is basically
an interim operation, aimed at complementing the First Education Project and
preparing a third one.
20.       The Bank is cooperating with the Government to cope with rapid
urbanization in the Ivory Coast. A study of housing and urban transport
needs in Abidjan is being financed with Bank funds; an urban development
project based thereon will be appraised in November/December. In January
1975, the Bank extended a loan for sewerage and drainage development xwhich
will cover the first phase of a ten-year Government program to improve
sanitation in Abidjan. The Bank also plans to appraise later this year a
water supply project for secondary centers.
21.       In view of the predominance of foreign ownership and management
in the private sector of the Ivorian economy, the Government is placing high
priority on strengthening local entrepreneurship. In support of this policy
we appraised last fall two projects, which carry forward the special effort
inaugurated in Western Africa through a 1971 Bank Studv of African private
enterprise. A loan for the promotion of small scale enterprises was approved
in August. The project is designed to support medium scale industrial develop-
ment. In line with the Government's regional development policies substantial
investments are foreseen in later years for industry and power in the south-
western region, and the Government is likely to request the Bank Group's
assistance for these.
22.       Of the total external public debt outstanding at the end of 1974,
25 percent was provided by governments, 20 percent by international organi-
zations (of which 50 percent by the Bank Group), and 30 percent by private
banks and bond issues, while 25 percent came in the form of suppliers' credits.
The capital not supplied by international organizations came mainly from four
countries, France (32 percent), USA (25 percent), Italy (10 percent), and
Germany (7 percent). France and the European Communities remain the principal.
source of development assistance in grant form, accounting for about 8 percent
of the flow of foreign assistance to the public sector.
23.       Bank Group lending to the Ivory Coast, which has averaged about
US$30 million per year in the past eight years, is expected to increase sub-
stantially over the next several years. The Bank Group's share of the Ivory
Coast's external debt which, at the end of 1974, stood at approximately 10
percent (including undisbursed), is likely to increase in the next five-year
period to about 20 percent. The Bank Group's share of total debt service is
at present 2.7 percent and is expected to go up to about 7 percent by 1980.



-8-
PART III - INDUSTRi' A!'TD BANKING IN THE IVORY COAST
Industry
24.       An analysis of industry in the Ivorian economy is provided in the
report "Current Status and Plrospects of the Industrial Sector in the Ivory
Coast" (Report No. 553-IVC) of February 4, 1975. It indicates that manufac-
turing in the Ivory Coast grew by about 15 percent per annum during 1960-73.
As a result, the share of manufacturing in GDP rose from 4 percent in 1960 to
13 percent in 1972. Gross investments in the industrial sector totalled
US$329 million at the end of 1972, compared to US$178 million in 1968; new
investments in 1971 and 1972 amounted to US$83 million (projected total for
1971-1975 Plan period - US$209 million). Manufacturing employed about 38,000
persons or only about 1.5 percent of the total labor force in 1972. However,
employment in the manufacturing sector represents 13 percent of all salaried
employment in the modern sector of the economy. The growth rate in industrial
employment was 10.6 percent per year during the period 1966-72.
25.       Growth in the industrial sector is largely due to the substantial
growth of the domestic market. Income generated by a diversified agricultural
sector has supported a rapid growth of traditional industries (food products,
beverages, tobacco, textiles, and footwear). In the modern manufacturing
sector, growth has been largely determined by import substitution industries.
The stable political climate, active policies of industrial promotion, an
Investment Code affording various incentives, the convertibility of the CFA
franc, and the existence of a relatively well-developed infrastructure have
contributed, together with an ample supply of foreign capital and management
attracted by these conditions, to the rapid growth of the industrial sector.
26.       The industrial sector is, for the most part, in the hands of
foreigners. At the end of 1971, it was estimated that 90 percent
of assets in the modern manufacturing sector belonged to non-Ivorians and
only 15 percent of the managerial and professional technical staff were
Ivorians. Ivorianization of capital and management has become a major con-
cern in recent years, and the Government has taken various steps in that
direction, including the creation, in 1963, of the Office pour la Promotion
de l'Entreprise Ivoirienne (OPEI), of a Guarantee Fund and of a Participation
Fund, participation in banks and commercial enterprises by the Societe
Nationale de Financement (SOVAFI), prescription of Ivorianization schedules
for enterprises granted investment incentives, and reservation of certain
sectors (e.g. bakeries) for Ivorians. Further steps are needed to bring into
being a'skilled Ivorian labor force at all levels and to foster the emergence
of Ivorian entrepreneurs.
27.       Generally the industrial policy of the Ivory Coast can be judged as
comprehensive, providing incentives to industrial development on sound princi-
ples. However, public policy towards investment allocation in industry has
not always been clear, and the criteria for public capital participations



have to be more carefully evaluated. The Government is presently reviewing
the incentive system, taking into account the basic suggestions made by the
Bank's economic mission. A reform is envisaged making the granting of in-
vestment incentives more discretionary and responsive to each individual
case, including provision for the gradual reduction over time of
privileges granted as investment incentives. The Government is also con-
sidering abolishing its policy of exemptions or reductions of import duties
for capital equipment and intermediate materials and introducing export in-
centives for all industrial exports.
28.       The 1976-1980 Development Plan projects a growth rate for value-added
in industry of nearly 13 percent per year. Industry's share in GDP is pro-
jected to increase from 13 percent in 1972 to 15 percent in 1975 and to about
19 percent in 1980. Processing of agricultural and forestry raw materials for
export is expected to make a larger contribution to industrial growth than
before. As a result, it is projected that by 1980 the share of industrial
exports in total exports (24 percent in 1972) will increase substantially.
Banking
29.       Besides the Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO),
financial institutions in the Ivory Coast include four commercial banks, three
development banks, and two leasing institutions. In addition, the Caisse
Autonome d'Amortissement (CAA) manages public debt, holds public deposits and
mobilizes local savings through tax-free bonds. Another public institution,
SONAFI, participates in projects of national interest.   Finally, the Govern-
ment-established Guarantee Fund provides guarantees for credits to small
Ivorian enterprises.
30.       The commercial banks provide short- and medium-term financing to
all sectors of the economy. The development banks lend at short-, medium-
and long-term: The Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Agricole (BNDA)
specializes in agricultural lending, whereas the Credit de la Cote d'Ivoire
(CCI) has mainly financed housing, vehicles and consumer goods. The Banque
Ivoirienne pour le Developpement Industriel (BIDI) has mostly focussed on
lending to medium- and large-scale enterprises, including some long-term
loans to the tourism sector.
31.       Interest rates and credit distribution are controlled by BCEAO through
the discount system. BCEAO is currently implementing a fundamental reform
aiming at: (a) raising interest rates in order to mobilize local savings
and to reduce inexpensive local borrowing by foreign investors, (b) linking
credit'allocation to sectoral needs, and (c) encouraging access to credit by
national enterprises. Interest rates charged by banks are determined by
adding to the discount rates spreads which vary according to the nature and
term of the credit extended. Until last June, BCEAO had a single discount
rate, which had been raised from 3.5 percent to 5.5 percent in early 1973.
As of July 1, two discount rates exist. The priority discount rate of 5.5
percent applies to agricultural short-term financing, loans to Ivorian small
scale enterprises, and loans to individuals for housing; the "normal" discount



- 10
rate of 8 percent applies to all other loans. Taking into account this new
structure, it is estimated that interest rates will vary between 6.5 percent
and 13 percent.  A 19.05 percent Taxe de Prestation     de Services (TPS) is
charged on interest. Banks collect this tax for the Government. CCI and
BNDA loans are exempted from that tax; BIDI's loans were exempted until
February 1975. BIDI's lending rate on most of its long-term loans is now
11 percent per annum; adding the 19.05 percent TPS on the interest results
in an effective cost of tlhese loans of more than 13 percent. CCI's rates,
by comparison, range from 6.75 to 12 percent.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
32.       The Banque Ivoirienne de Developpement Industriel (BIDI) was estab-
lished in 1965 under the joint sponsorship of the Ivorian Government, Chase
Manhattan Bank and Lazard Brothers, with the objective of encouraging the
development of private industrial enterprises in the Ivory Coast, of promoting
the participation of foreign and domestic capital in the industrial develop-
ment of the country, and of developing a capital market. IFC subscribed 7.1
percent of the share capital. BIDI's volume and importance expanded rapidly.
This expansion, coupled with increasing difficulty in raising long-term re-
sources, motivated BIDI to request Bank financing. Therefore, a Bank mission
visited the Ivory Coast at the end of 1974 to appraise the proposed project.
Negotiations were held in Washington from August 28 to September 2, 1975.
The Ivorian delegation was led by Mr. L. Naka, Director General of the Caisse
Autonome d'Amortissement and included Mr. A. Diby, Managing Director of BIDI.
A loan and project summary is included in Annex III. Appraisal Report
No. 669a-IVC of October 21, 1975 is being distributed separately.
Capital Structure and Resources
33.       There has been no change in BIDI's initial ownership.    Its share
capital of CFAF 1,050 million (US$5.25 million) is equally divided between
public and private shareholders. The Ivorian Government holds 21.1 percent,
BCEAO 5.7 percent, IFC 7.1 percent, and French public institutions hold 16.1
percent. Of the foreign private investors Chase Manhattan Bank holds 8.9
percent,Lazard Brothers 12 percent,and other financial institutions 16.6 per-
cent of the share capital. Ivorian commercial banks (5.4 percent) and other Ivo-
rian shareholders (7.1 percent) account for the rest. A Government loan of
CFAF 1.25 billion is subordinated to BIDI's share capital; it carries no
interest and will mature between 1980 and 1995.
34.       BIDI has been successful in attracting external resources at con-
cessionary terms, in addition to its local resources from BCEAO and CAA.
Foreign resources have cone from the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW)
(four loans totalling DM 30 million), USAID (two loans totalling US$7.5 million),
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) (Canadian $6 million),



- 11 -
the Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) (FF 1.2 million), and
recently the Deutsche Entwicklungsgesellschaft (DEG) (two loans totalling DM
10 million). Many of these loans have restrictions on their use; in parti-
cular, the loans from CIDA and USAID are tied to Canadian and U.S. procure-
ment. BIDI also borrowed CFAF 1.25 billion from the Chase Manhattan Bank;
the interest rate on this loan is 1.5 percent above Paris InterBank Rate, and
averaged 14 percent per annum in 1974.
Objectives and Role
35.       The overall objective of BIDI is to encourage the development of
private industrial enterprises and to promote the participation of foreign
and domestic capital in the industrial development of the Ivory Coast. To
this end, BIDI, which has been nearly the only domestic source of long-term
financing for industry in the Ivory Coast, has progressively expanded its
operations through the granting of long-term loans, investment in equity, and
association with commercial banks through extending medium-term rediscountable
loans. Its disbursements now represent about 10 percent of industrial invest-
ment in the Ivory Coast. Most of BIDI's financing has gone to medium sized
enterprises. Given CCI's recognized role as lender to small scale enterprise,
BIDI will continue to deal primarily with medium-scale and large-scale indus-
trial enterprises, although its influence on large-scale projects is relatively
limited since its normal maximum commitment to any single enterprise is about
CFAF 400 million (US$2.0 million).
36.       More than half of BIDI's operations have been related to the creation
of new enterprises. The share of its operations directed to majority
Ivorian-owned enterprises has steadily risen in recent years and now repre-
sents 36 percent of the total, compared with only about 10 percent at the
end of BIDI's FY70, which demonstrates BIDI's role in assisting Ivorian
enterprises, since it is estimated that more than 70 percent of industrial
firms are in foreign hands. BIDI's strategy for the future is to assume a
more developmental role: (a) It will emphasize its promotional efforts to
stimulate new projects, as demonstrated by the creation in 1972 of Societe
d'Etudes de Developpement Industriel (SEDI), and the recent establishment of
a Department of Research and Studies. (b) It will further increase its share
of operations directed towards Ivorian enterprises, which is projected to grow
by 20 percent annually, compared with BIDI's estimated overall growth of 10
percent.
Management and Organization
37.       BIDI's Board of Directors normally meets only twice a year to dis-
cuss the annual report, financial statements and proposals for distribution
of profit and to convene the Annual General Meeting. It has delegated all
other powers to BIDI's Executive Committee, which meets regularly and decides
on lending and investment proposals on the basis of sound financial principles.
38.       With the help of foreign partners, BIDI has become a strong insti-
tution. BIDI's appraisal work has progressively improved, but needs further
upgrading in particular in respect of economic analysis of projects. BIDI's



- 12 -
management recognizes this need for improvement, and it agreed to strengthen
the economic capabilities of its staff (Section 3.07 of the Loan Agreement).
A Bank sponsored seminar on project evaluation is scheduled to be held in
Abidjan in 1976 for this purpose. Internal procedures regarding accounting,
disbursement, and follow-up are satisfactory, but financial planning is still
weak and needs much improvement. BIDI undertook to implement appropriate
measures to strengthen its financial planning (Section 3.07 of the Loan
Agreement).
Operating Policies
39.       BIDI's operations are directed by its Statement of Objectives and
Management Policy which conforms in most respects to the policies adopted by
other development finance companies. It prescribes as the principal function
of BIDI the assistance to private industrial enterprises in the Ivory Coast
through loans and equity investments for productive purposes; special atten-
tion is to be paid to projects proposed by Ivorian promoters. The Statement
includes rules that BIDI's maximum single commitment is normally limited
to 15 percent of its equity and the Government subordinated loan; that BIDI's
equity participation shall normally not exceed 30 percent of the share capital
of the enterprise in which it invests; and that the total equity portfolio is
limited to BIDI's equity.
Operations and Financial Results
40.       Since its creation in 1965, BIDI has made loans totalling CFAF 20.1
billion (US$100.5 million) and equity participations totalling CFAF 0.8 billion
(US$4 million).  During these 11 years, BIDI has assisted 224 enterprises.
Its total portfolio at the end of   FY74 ws Cs A   9 billion (US$45 million), of
which CFAF 6.6 billion (US$33 million) was in long-term loans. Arrears are
only about 2.2 percent of the loan portfolio, and are mostly covered by
Government guarantees. The geographical and sector distribution of BIDI
operations reflects the predominance of Abidjan in the Ivorian economy;
however, since the Government is putting emphasis on development in several
regional growth centers other than the capital, it can be expected that the
proportion of BIDI's operations outside the Abidjan area will increase in the
coming years.
41.        BIDI's net profits increased from CFAF 134 million (US$0.67 million)
in FY71 to CFAF 258 million (US$1.29 million) in FY73, i.e. a return of about
22 percent on average equity. Profits in FY74 decreased to CFAF 164 million
(US$0:82 million) as a result of slower disbursements, increased cost of re-
sources, and a decrease in dividends received. Most of the net profits have
been allocated to a tax-free general provision for risks, and as a result,
taxation averaged 10 percent of net profiL lj in the recent years.  The distri-
butable profit has been calculated so as to yield dividends of 5 percent in
FY69, which increased to 7 percent in FY73. Despite the decrease in profits
in FY74, the 7 percent dividend could be maintained on a share capital increased
in 1974 by 50 percent following distribution of a stock dividend. Administrative
expenses have averaged 1.8 percent of total assets in the past three years.



- 13 -
42.       BIDI's situation at the end of FY74 was sound with equity totalling
about CFAF 1.4 billion (US$7 million), a Government subordinated loan of
CFAF 1.25 billion (US$6.25 million), and borrowings amounting to CFAF 7 bil-
lion (US$35 million). The ratio of BIDI's medium and long-term debt to equity
plus the Government loan amounted to 3.2:1 at the end of FY74. Considering
repayments on the Government loan before 1993 (expected last maturity of the
proposed Bank loan) as debt, and payments after 1993 as assimilated to equity,
the ratio was 4.4:1; BIDI agreed not to incur any debt which would result in
a ratio, calculated on this basis, of more than 6:1 (Section 4.06 of the Loan
Agreement).
Projected Operations and Resources required
43.         BIDI's operations have been projected to increase-by about 10 per-
cent annually from its FY75 on. New commitments through the end of 1977, are
projected to amount to about CFAF 13.1 billion (US$65.5 million). Since
CFAF 2.6 billion (US$13 million) thereof is expected to be for medium-term
loans to be discounted with BCEAO, commitments for non-discountable operations
are projected to amount to CFAF 10.5 billion (US$52.2 million) over this
period. These will be partly financed by BIDI's internally generated funds
and its use of revolving funds amounting to CFAF 4.8 billion (US$24 million)
including CFAF 2 billion of its own resources. With respect to the CFAF 5.7
billion (US$28.5 million) of new resources needed, the CCCE has indicated its
willingness to provide about CFAF 0.7 billion per annum (i.e., about CFAF 1.7
billion or US$8.5 million over the said period). The DEG has already made two
loans of DM 5 million (US$2 million) each to BIDI and has also expressed its
willingness to continue lending to this institution. The African Development
Bank is presently considering a loan of about 2 million units of account (about
US$2.4 million).   The proposed Bank loan of US$8 million equivalent would help
to close the remaining resource-gap. Additional bilateral financing is expected
from German, Canadian and other sources.
Terms
44.       The proposed Bank loan would be made directly to BIDI on terms
similar to those for other development finance companies. BIDI would relend
the proceeds of the loan for terms up to 15 years to its sub-borrowers. Prior
Bank approval would be necessary for each sub-project estimated to cost more
than US$200,000, and the aggregate free limit would be US$2.0 million (Sec-
tion 2.02(b) of the Loan Agreement). The terminal date for submission of
sub-projects to the Bank under the proposed loan would be December 31, 1977.
Amortization of the proposed Bank loan would conform substantially to the
aggregate of the amortization schedules applicable to the specific investment
projects expected to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan.
45.         BIDI's lending rate on most of its long-term loans is now 11 percent
per annum (see para. 31). BIDI has agreed to raise its lending-rate for all
long-term loans to this level after the date of the agreement.(Section 3.03(c)
and 4.08 of the Loan Agreement). In addition, BIDI collects from its borrowers
for the Government the TPS of 19.05 percent on the interest; this results in
an effective cost of its long-term funds of more than 13 percent per annum.



- 14 -
46.       In the past the Government hias assumed the exchange risk on all of
BIDI's foreign currency borrowings.   Similarlv, thc Government accepted the
exchange risk on Bank funds under the Tourism Develnp7ent Loan, which was
channelled through CCI, against a fee of 1 percent. In the meantime, the
Government has adopted the general policv that the ultimat.e beneficiaries of
externally borrowed funds shoul]c normally carrv the exchange risk.  This
policy was already applied to the Bank's Small-Scale Enterprises Project.
In accordance with this policy, the sub-borrowers would bear the exchange
risk for the proposed loan (Section 3.03(b) of tihe Loan A,reement).
Disbursement and Procurement
47.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbujrsed against the
c.i.f. cost of imported goods, the foreign cost of services, and 35 percent
of cost of civil works (representing their estimated foreign component) of
sub-projects supported by BIDI.   Sub-borrowers would procure goods and ser-
vices through normal commercial channels.
Benefits
48.       Since its inception in 1965, BIDI has played an important role in
the sponsorship of local enterprises serving, principally, an import-sub-
stitution function.  BIDI has been able to attract foreign private capital
in its own right. Consistent with the changing thrust of industrial policy
in the Ivory Coast, BIDI's future operations will take more account of the
need to consolidate past success by emphasizing the increasing importance of
Ivorian ownership and management of enterprises. BIDI will also increase its
efforts to sponsor export-oriented development. In these aims Bank partici-
pation would play an important part, in addition to helping to fill the gap
in BIDI's financing requirements. The Bank's involvement would strengthen
BIDI's operational effectiveness in the areas of financial planning and
control and in the evaluation of projects. In short the Bank would be assist-
ing a sound and established financial intermediary, handling 10 percent of
industrial investment in the Ivory Coast, to adapt to the changing environment.
49.       In more quantitative terms, the proposed loan would enable BIDI
to participate in investments totalling CFAF 15 billion (US$75.0 million)
through 1977, creating over 5,000 new jobs. It is expected that BIDI will
earn an average return on its equity of 20 percent from FY77.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMETITS AD AMJTHORITIES
50.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank- and BTDT, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of the Ivorv Coast and the Bank,
the report to the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Execujtive Directors separately.



- 15 -
51.       The draft Agreements conform generally to the normal pattern for
loans to development finance companies. Features of the Loan Agreements of
special interest are referred to in paragraphs 38, 42 and 46 and 47 of this
report.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. Projects in Execution -
Ln. No. 611, 612,    First Oil Palm and Coconut ProiecLs; Three loans for a
613, 759 and 760     total of US$17.1 million of June 13, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1975.   Second Oil Palm and Coconut Projects:
Two loans for a total of US$7.0 million of June 22, 1971;
Closing Dates: June 30, 1975 and November 30, 1977.
These projects are being implemented satisfactorily, and disburse-
ment is proceeding normally. The oil mills financed in these projects pro-
cessed about 220,000 tons of fruits in 1974. The planting programs are
proceeding well.
Ln. No. 667          First Education Project:   US$11.0 million Loan of April 27,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1977.
Implementation of this project was slow, especially in the initial
years. This resulted from (i) delays in the decision making process, espe-
cially for the selection and appointment of consulting architects. (ii) the
complexity of consultations between international and bilateral donors on the
specifications of the Instructional Television Production Center; and (iii)
uncertainties about the project description which culminated in its renego-
tiation and amendment in 1971. The amendment consisted of (a) the reduction
from 11 to 10 of the number of educational institutions to be constructed
under the project; (b) the deletion of Bank financing of capitalized interest
except for the amount already disbursed; and (c) reallocation of the proceeds
of the loan to take account of modified architectural standards. Since then,
the project implementation has substantially improved, construction work for.
all project schools has been completed and the schools will be in operation
by October 1975, except the technology institute at Abidjan and the ITV com-
plex at Bouake, which will be completed respectively in January and June 1976.
The Closing Date has been extended to June 30, 1977.
Ln. No. 667-2        Supplementary Financing for the First Education Project:
US$2.2 million Loan of January 17, 1975; Closing Date:
June 30, 1977.
At appraisal of the First Education Project, the US dollar wqas worth
247 CFA francs. When the project cost wqas recalculated in October 1971,
the exchange rate was US$1 = CFAF 277.    Since then the dollar dropped sub-

the progress of the projects in exscition and, in particular, to report
any problems which are being encou-, -red and the action being taken to
remedy them.   They should be read     t,is sense and with the under-

stantially to about 225 CFA francs in January 1975. In the fall of 1974 the
Government requested supplementary financing to offset the increase in the
project's dollar cost due to currency realignments.
Ln. No. 686          Cocoa Project:  US$7.5 million Loan of June 5, 1970;
Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
The Cocoa Loan has been amended to reduce the number of hectares to
be rehabilitated. Difficulties arose in supervising large numbers of farmers
who used project inputs to treat non-project cocoa. The Government agreed to
substantially reduce the size of the rehabilitation program. (See Memorandum
to the Executive Directors R73-74 of April 13, 1973). The project is proceed-
ing satisfactorily except for administrative problems which have delayed the
submission of requests for reimbursement. However, administration of this
and the second project (Ln. 1069-IVC) have been combined and an estimated
3,200 ha of cocoa plantings will be transferred from the first to the second
project. Savings of US$2.2 million resulting from the amendment (R73-74) and
the merging of the two projects were cancelled at the date of signature of
the second project. The first project is therefore considered to be completed.
Ln. No. 761          Second Highway Project:  US$20.5 million Loan of June 22,
1971; Closing Date: November 30, 1975.
A section of the Yabayo-Man Road will be rerouted due to present
uncertainties concerning the construction of a dam in the area of the road.
(See Memorandum to the Executive Directors R73-170 of July 6, 1973). Con-
struction of the Man-Duekoue and Bouake-Katiola Roads is making good progress.
At the Government's request, Bank financing of the detailed engineering of
the Katiola-Ferkessedougou Road was abandoned: the road will be constructed
under Government financing. The Government has requested to use the funds.
thus released to finance a second phase of an urban study in Abidjan.
Ln. No. 837          Third Highway Project:  US$17.5 million Loan of June 23,
1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
The road maintenance and betterment program has started. A second
call for bids for the reinforcement works had to be made, however, due to
inadequate submissions. The project incurred substantial cost overruns due to
currency realignments and abnormal price escalation. The Bank is presently
discussing with the Government the need to reduce the percentage of the Bank's
financing of this project and to correspondingly increase the Government's
financial contribution.
Cr. No. 406         Fourth Highway Project:   US$7.5 million Credit of June 28,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Construction of the N'zi bridge has started. Bids on the Yabayo-
Gagnoa Road have been received and contracts awarded. This project is experi-
encing cost overruns similar to those of the third project. These are also
under discussion with the Government.

Ln. No. 938         Rubber. Plantation Loan:  US$8.4 million Loan of October
23, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Land clearing and planting are proceeding close to appraisal
schedule with about 2,300 ha expected to be planted by the end of 1975.
PJantation standards are good and construction of roads and houses proceeds
satisfactorily. After replacement of several key officers of the management
company, projects management has improved and administrative and financial
matters appear to be under control. Unexpected price increases have caused
substantial cost overruns. By the end of 1975, the co-lenders (Caisse
Centrale de Cooperation Economique and European Development Fund) will review
with the Bank, as provided by the loan agreement, the economic justification
of the second phase of the project, to decide if and how the second phase
should be completed.
Ln. No. 981         Telecommunications Project:   US$25.0 million Loan of May 3,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Consultants have been selected and bidding documents are being
prepared.
Ln. No. 1036         Third Oil Palm Project:  US$2.6 million Loan of July 31,
1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
At the end of July, this Loan became effective. The planting pro-
gram is underway. It is estimated that 1,200 ha of palm oil estate will be
established; the outgrowers program is progressing well.
Ln. No. 1069         Second Cocoa Project:  US$20.0 million Loan of January
10. 1975; Closing Date:   June 30, 1980.
This Loan is not yet effective. 1/
Ln. No. 1076        Abidjan Sewerage and Drainage Project:   US$9.0 million
Loan of January 17, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
This Loan is not yet effective.
Ln. No. 1077        Cotton Areas Rural Development Project:   US$31.0 million
Loan of January 17, 1975; Closing Date: March 31, 1982.
Implementation of the project has begun satisfactorily.   Land clear-
ing has begun and it is expected that 4000 ha will be cleared before the end
of the year.  The Blacksmith Training Program has started and CIDT, the pro-
ject executing agency is preparing loan Vequests to BNDA to finance black-
smith's kits. Bids for the construction of staff housing are being prepared.
I/   This Loan became effective on September 30, 1975.
