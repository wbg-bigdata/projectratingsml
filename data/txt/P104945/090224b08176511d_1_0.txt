                         date on June 12, 2009 only one bidder submitted bids for all cities. The procurement process of the Lease Contracts was declared unsuccessful on August 8, 2009. It should be
                         noted that the procurement process coincided with the peak of the global financial crisis and the difficulties experimented by the PPP arrangements in Tanzania. Most potential
                         bidders seemingly were not willing to take any risk in participating in new ventures in Mozambique. On February 12, 2012, the Grant Agreement No. TF091213 was restructured,
                         modifying the development objectives, revising the components, reallocating the Grant proceeds between components, canceling US$1.0 million, and extending the closing date of

                         Maputo (AdM), was only signed on July 20, 2009. During the first round of the procurement process for the selection of the IMVA, only two firms submitted expressions of interest by

                         proposals were received. The second selection process for the IMVA was successful and in November 2009, AdM began implementing the connections. By March 2012, the total
                         number of connections approved by the IMVA was 8,726. However, AdM has demonstrated capacity to achieve the agreed targets of 28,950 by the end of the project, in June 2014.
