                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Grant Agreement was signed with FIPAG in April, 2008 with the objective to increase piped –water access to the poor in the recipients cities by providing out-put based
                         payments to private operators. The original project design included installations in (a) Maputo (servicing 143,000 people) and (b) Beira, Pemba, Quelimane and Nampula (expanding
                         access to approximately 325,000 people in these Northern cities). However, due to the cancelation of the lease contract bidding process for private operators in the Northern cities,
                         FIPAG presented their proposal to reallocate the GPOBA funds for the northern cities to focus all activities on Maputo. This reallocation, project extension, revision to the
                         components and modification to the Project Development Objective was approved through a restructuring of the Grant Agreement, February, 12, 2012.
