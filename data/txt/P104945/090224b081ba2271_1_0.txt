                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Grant Agreement was signed with FIPAG in April, 2008 with the objective to increase piped-water access to the poor in the recipients cities by providing out-put based payments
                         to private operators. The original project design included installations in (a) Maputo (servicing 143,000 people) and (b) Beira, Pemba, Quelimane and Nampula (expanding access to
                         approximately 325,000 people in these Northern cities). However, due to the cancelation of the lease contract bidding process for private operators in the Northern cities, FIPAG
                         presented their proposal to reallocate the GPOBA funds for the northern cities to focus all activities on Maputo. This reallocation, project extension, revision to the components and
                         modification to the Project Development Objective was approved through a restructuring of the Grant Agreement, February, 12, 2012.

                         Now, after 37 months of operation (Nov 2009 to Dec 2012), AdeM has connected 15,527 new eligible customers in greater Maputo under the project and some US$2,020,035 in
                         subsidies have been approved under the Grant as per the verified results and recommendations of the Independent Monitoring and Verification Agent. Due to a strong performance
                         over the last quarter of 2012, the total number of connections completed up to end of December is now generally in line with the project plan and progress targets. Moreover, the

                         service provision after 3 months from being connected indicate that AdeM is in compliance with agreed service standards.
