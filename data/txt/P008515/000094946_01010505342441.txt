Introduction
After independence in 1991, the Kyrgyz Republic faced enormous challenges in the economic
sphere, and its system of social protection and social services was inadequate to an emerging
market economy. There was a lack of distinction between social insurance and social assistance,
and wide eligibility for social assistance benefits which were allocated with no targeting of



assistance to vulnerable groups. Many benefits were excessively generous, causing an
unsustainable burden on the state budget.
Other aspects of the social safety net were also insufficient. The data and analytical
capabilities to monitor poverty and unemployment were inadequate. And the employment service
did not actually focus its efforts on identifying job opportunities for unemployed workers. Finally,
the vocational training system, although extensive, was inadequate for the requirements of the
transition the Kyrgyz Republic was going through.
The Social Safety Net Project was IDA's first investment operation in the Kyrgyz
Republic. It was a capacity-building operation intended to improve mechanisms to identify the
poor and make social programs more effective and efficient in targeting and delivering social
assistance.
3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective:
Statement of Objectives
The project was a capacity building operation to improve mechanisms to identify the poor and
make social programs more effective and efficient in targeting and delivering social assistance,
especially to the most vulnerable groups. The project was also intended to make employment
services and training more efficient and effective in assisting the unemployed, particularly through
an improved capability to deliver unemployment benefits, and by promoting the redeployment of
labor.
Evaluation of Objectives
The objectives were clear, consistent with the Bank's goals as stated in the CAS, and important
for the development of the country. Project design was consistent with best practice at the time of
project inception. While the social assistance and poverty monitoring objectives were realistic, the
assumptions underlying the employment service and training components--while they appeared
reasonable given the Bank's knowledge at the time and consistent with the consensus view among
donors of Kyrgyz growth prospects--turned out to be unrealistic in hindsight. This was because
the Kyrgyz Republic (1) did not actually experience mass layoffs as had been believed, and (2) the
country experienced a severe recession during the period of the SSNP, so fewer new jobs were
available. Real GDP fell around 45% from 1991-95, and had only partially recovered by 1999 (see
Figure 2).
3.2 Revised Objective:
N/A
3.3 Original Components:
The Project involved four components. The Social Assistance Component provided equipment,
technical assistance and training intended to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Labor and
Social Protection (MLSP) to provide targeted social assistance, including cash and in-kind
benefits, and mobilize community organizations to enhance such assistance. (Among the
-2 -



component's key indicators were: the establishment of a means testing benefit system (MTBS);
establishment of a Special Grant Unit; and reorganization of the MLSP).
The Poverty Monitoring Component provided equipment, technical assistance and training aimed
at strengthening the capacity of the National Committee for Statistics (Natstatkom) to carry out
representative surveys, especially for poverty and unemployment, in order to provide enhanced
information and guidance to social agencies for improving the targeting and delivery of support
services. (Included among this component's key indicators: carrying out 4 household surveys;
analysis of data and formation of a users' committee; training of personnel in field work, sampling
and analysis).
The Employment Services Component provided equipment, technical assistance and training
intended to strengthen the capacity of the Employment Service under the MLSP. (Included
among this component's key indicators: strengthening ES delivery system including the
establishment of model offices; strengthening systems for delivery in rural areas; strengthening the
Deparment of Employment and management systems including policy analysis, program planning
and financial management).
The Training Component provided technical assistance, training equipment and materials to
ensure a minimum capacity to respond to market demand for training in skills required for a
market economy. Specifically, the component activities were designed to (a) develop and
implement a demand driven training system; (b) develop and implement a comprehensive strategy
for adult training and retraining; (c) strengthen the Department of Training of Workers and
Entrepreneurs (DTWE); (d) establish a modem training capacity in the Information Center and 9
retraining centers. (Included among this component's key indicators are: strengthening the DTWE
central functions; systemic curriculum development for 9 model retraining centers and equipping
and expanding the centers; establishing and equipping an information center; and supporting
demand driven training in centers)

3.4 Revised Components:
N/A
3.5 Qualitv at Enti:
Quality at entry was satisfactory. The project was consistent with the CAS and with government
priorities at the time. While the design of the poverty monitoring and social assistance
components was sound, as noted earlier the employment services and training components were
based on the assumptions (1) that mass layoffs would occur, and (2) that the Kyrgyz economy
would produce enough new jobs to justify bolstering training and employment services. These
-3-



assumptions were considered reasonable at the time--and were the consensus view of providers of
foreign assistance--but turned out to be overly optimistic regarding growth and overly pessimistic
on layoffs. Finally, the training component did not take adequate account of the deteriorated
physical condition of most of the schools, and the required rationalization of facilities and staff.
In general, the project design paid insufficient attention to sustainability, i.e., how the Kyrgyz
Republic would be able to sustain, using its own budgetary resources, the systems and changes
implemented under the SSNP. The availability of budgetary funds was extremely limited during
the SSNP. (See Figure 1).
The Bank made extensive efforts to involve and inform the government during project
identification and appraisal. While key Kyrgyz counterparts at middle levels of Government were
heavily involved in the project and knowledgeable about its goals, turnover in government, as well
as the lack of Kyrgyz experience or project ownership by senior officials negated this to an extent.
Consequently, as the project proceeded, Kyrgyz knowledge and ownership of the project
fluctuated -- the view was expressed by one counterpart that the Kyrgyz "saw the project as
something that was happening to them, rather than something they were themselves undertaking
(with foreign assistance)."
Assessment of Design
The project design was complex, with four components involving different disciplines and
expertise, but with 3 of the 4 components related to one agency (Ministry of Labor and Social
Protection). The project had been streamlined from an initially larger design, and in hindsight
colexity is not seen as a factor that hindered project progress (though technical inputs during
supervision proved inadequate to handle the complexity). The components were clearly related to
achieving the project objectives, and there was substantial technical assistance and contractor
support for each component, which was appropriate.
Because the SSNP involved several governmental agencies, the PCU was designed as a strong,
independent implementing agency reporting through a Project Policy Council to a First Vice
Prime Minister (in practice, the Council very seldom met after the first two years). Each
component had a coordinator who was an employee of the participating agency. The independent
PCU was, on balance, an effective mechanism for project implementation. Its independent status
insulated it to a substantial degree from Ministerial pressures regarding, e.g., procurement.
There had been one prior operation, a Rehabilitation Credit which became effective in July 1993,
in the Kyrgyz Republic prior to the initiation of the SSNP. And there had also been limited Bank
experience in targeted social assistance programs in transition economies. Consequently, in
designing the project, most of the experience drawn upon was necessarily from non-FSU
countries facing different development challenges and at a higher income level than the Kyrgyz
Republic.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcomelachievementof objective:
On balance, outcome overall was marginally satisfactory, with positive accomplishments
- 4 -



modestly outweighing shortcomings. The SSNP achieved most of its relevant objectives,
implemented important reforms, and laid a foundation for future progress in the social sector. The
Kyrgyz Republic is now collecting reliable data on living standards which it can use to monitor
trends in living standards and household behavior, and to formulate policy. However, the project
had significant deficiencies, especially in the employment services and training components. In
these two areas, the extent to which expected development benefits were achieved was diminished
by the severe lack of available jobs, lack of Kyrgyz budgetary resources, and ineffective
implementation and supervision of some important aspects of the project.
4.2 Outputs by components:
Poverty Monitoring
Achievement was highly satisfactory. The capacity of the National Committee for Statistics
(Natstatkom) to undertake household surveys and analyze data was greatly strengthened,
especially efforts focused on poverty and unemployment. This was done by means of technical
assistance in sampling, survey design, and data analysis. Natstatkom carried out a number of
household surveys to provide better information to social agencies which contributed greatly to
improvement of the targeting and effectiveness of assistance.
Social Assistance
Achievement was marginally satisfactory. A means-tested benefit system was introduced and
implemented on a national level-with general support by the borrower-a substantial
improvement over the earlier system. The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection was
reorganized, and the benefits administration system was modernized and automated on a
nation-wide basis, with the SSNP providing 500 computers. (However, unreliable electric power,
viruses, turnover in key staff, and a lack of funds for maintenance and repair has reduced the
extent to which automation has contributed to agency capacity.) There was a decline in the
number of individuals receiving social assistance, and a modest increase in the monthly benefit.
The Kyrgyz Republic also passed a new law on social benefits, effective in January, 1998, which
codified the reforms noted above. As a result of the SSNP, it is clear that the country has had
substantial experience in improved ways to identify and support the poor during the transition
process.
However, an assessment of the implementation of the social assistance reforms, completed in
early 2000, found significant errors of exclusion and inclusion (and significant reliance on in-kind
benefits) that are now being discussed under the framework of the Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper dialogue.
Employment Services
Achievement was unsatisfactory. A computer-based system was installed that allowed profiles of
job-seekers to be matched against vacancies reported by employers--an improvement over the
earlier arrangement. The information system could also calculate unemployment benefits. The
ES also implemented a regional planning and performance review system that improved
management and accountability of local units. And important reforms were implemented
regarding eligibility for benefits.
-5 -



However, while agency capacity was modestly enhanced, much of it is dependent on an aging
computer system. As with the other components, funding for repair, maintenance, and
replacement is inadequate. Taking into account the substantial turnover of skilled personnel
(especially those with information technology skills), lack of adequate agency computer training,
and shortfalls in agency budgets, it is questionable whether the computer system installed is
well-suited to agency circumstances or sustainable. The system is becoming outdated, is afflicted
with viruses, and is not fully-functional.
Additionally, the lack of funds: prevents the ES from encouraging self-employment and retraining,
and-due to the low benefit level-provides little incentive for the unemployment benefit to be
used as insurance against unemployment or as an incentive for people to be active in the labor
market. Finally, given the very limited number of new employment opportunities, it seems likely
that the effort to enhance ES capacity was of limited relevance, and that this component
consequently made little contribution to Kyrgyz economic development. As a March 1998
Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) mid-term evaluation of the component stated, "The ES is
dependent on improvements in the economy that will increase demand for trained workers. It can
contribute to economic regeneration by its work in increasing the skills of the workforce. If these
measures cannot be achieved, the project will merely have made an ineffective system more
efficient." (emphasis added). This last point also applies to unemployment benefits; while the
system itself may have been made somewhat more efficient, in the project's latter stages roughly
three quarters of employment benefits were paid in-kind (i.e., flour and sugar).
Training
Achievement was highly unsatisfactory. On the positive side, the Department of Training of
Workers and Entrepreneurs (DTWE) was somewhat strengthened by development of a
comprehensive strategy for adult training and retraining, systematic curriculum development for 9
model training centers, establishment of an Information Center, and an effort to make training
centers more demand-driven. Nine centers were physically renovated, and the SSNP also
provided a large amount of equipment for vocational training.
However, many critical reforms urged by the SSNP-including consolidation of the network of
1 15 vocational training schools-were not implemented. As noted earlier, most training facilities
were decrepit, a factor that was not adequately taken into account in the project design. (No
funds for civil works for schools were initially included in the Credit.) The Bank should have
taken into account that many facilities had leaky roofs, inadequate security, no heating, etc.,
before proceeding with other aspects of this component including the ordering of equipment for
vocational training. Only after equipment had started to arrive was a decision made to re-program
some project funds to renovate 9 vocational training facilities. A February, 1999, final evaluation
of the performance of the training component by IPS found achievement of nearly all of the
component's objectives as "below standard" or "poor." Only a handful were "standard" and none
higher.
While much of the SSNP procurement went smoothly, there were severe problems in the
procurement of equipment for vocational schools:
- 6 -



Some equipment was ordered from Europe that is generally not found in the Kyrgyz
Republic
Some items ordered arrived as much as 2 years late or not at all, and thus training could
not be coordinated with the equipment involved
* One occupation received 50% of the equipment budget for the entire training component.
However, some key occupations for Kyrgyz economic development-food processing,
tourism, and hotel-were addressed inadequately.
* Some materials supplied were obsolete or of substandard quality
* Many items were substantially over-priced or "gold-plated." For example the project
purchased printer cables for US$4,900 that were available locally for US$30, and also bought
a used automobile engine for US$20,000 that was available locally for US$100.
In addition, there was a lack of spare parts and consumables, slow and incomplete translation of
equipment instruction manuals, and a lack of set-up and training by equipment suppliers. These
deficiencies substantially diminished component achievement.
The reasons for the procurement shortfalls included:
The lack of sufficient attention to procurement in the project design, including a detailed
procurement plan
Procurement was performed by agency staff without prior experience in international
tenders, and with little or no input from end-users; consequently, procurement specifications
were poorly-developed
There was little or no guidance on scheduling or sequencing of procurement, resulting in
major delays and discontinuities in training; some equipment items continued to arrive in 1998
ICB procurement efforts produced only limited response, necessitating LIB re-bids, and in
some cases, direct contracting to procure the thousands of items required for the nine schools.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of retutrn:
It was not possible to compute an ERR, and a measure of cost-effectiveness was not practical.
4.4 Financial rate of r eturn:
N/A
4.5 Institutional development impact:
Institutional Development Impact (ID) is defined as the extent to which the project resulted
in an improvement in the country's ability to effectively use its human, organizational, and
financial resources. For the SSNP as a whole, institutional development impact was assessed as
modest, with progress in the individual components summarized in the table below and described
in the sections that follow.

For the Poverty Monitoring Component, while ID progress at first was slow-in part due to
less than expected knowledge transfer by the consultant-by project close it is judged that there
had been a substantial increase in Natstatkom capabilities: household surveys were being
undertaken by Natstatkom, sampling and data analysis capacity had been substantially
strengthened, and policy-makers acknowledged the value of the living standards data.
In the Social Assistance and Employment Services areas, capabilities were improved as
noted earlier. A means-tested benefit system was introduced, the MLSP was reorganized, and IT
systems were established. However, judged overall, the extent of the increase in these areas was
modest. Factors that acted to diminish ID included:
Considerable tumover among staff and policy-level officials (thus losing institutional
memory)
Lack of funds to sustain computer systems
Less success than envisioned on the part of the Technical Assistance contractors in
transferring knowledge; some of the models and concepts utilized were unsuitable for the
Kyrgyz environment
In the initial phases of the project, less success than foreseen in Kyrgyz absorption of new
concepts and knowledge (this was mainly because the country had only recently emerged from
a centrally planned economic system, and at first had difficulty absorbing concepts and
systems more suitable for a market system. However, absorption capacity improved
substantially as the project progressed)
In the Vocational Training area, ID was modest. While nine training centers were
physically rehabilitated, and new equipment was acquired, the reluctance of the GOK to
implement policy reforms presented a significant obstacle to effective ID.

* Failure of Mercury Bank-Mercury Bank, in which the Special Account for the Poverty
Monitoring Component was held, was closed in 1999, and the US$470,000 in the account
was frozen. This caused a temporary shortage of project funding which led to component
delays.
* Termination of the Contract for the Poverty Monitoring Component-The GOK believed
that the contractor on this component was not complying with all aspects of the contract.
Because the differences could not be reconciled, after a long dispute the government
terminated the contract in March, 1998. Unspent funds were reallocated to support
completion of the remaining tasks, but these circumstances required substantial effort in
supervision: caused considerable delays in this component: and required extension of the
project closing date.
Severe Recession-During most of the period of the SSNP, the Kyrgyz Republic endured
a severe recession. Figure 1 illustrates the severity of the fall in income; with 1991 set at 100,
real GDP reached a low of 55.0 in 1995, and had only recovered to 68.3 by 1999. This had
the effect, noted earlier in the text, of decreasing the number of jobs available, increasing the
demand for unemployment benefits, and decreasing government revenues.
The Borrower Contribution, appended to this report, acknowledges the assistance of the Bank in resolving this issue, as well
as the Mercury Bank issue.
5.2 Factors generally subject to governnment control:
Substantial Turnover in Government Ministers-Ministers supervising participating
agencies changed frequently. For example, from 1994-98, the leadership of the MLSP
changed 5 times (one individual served twice). New Ministers often changed many agency
managers and staff, causing significant delay and turbulence for the SSNP. As noted earlier,
this reduced effective Kyrgyz ownership of the project.
Substantial Tumover of Civil Servants-There was considerable turnover of agency staff
at all levels, especially those with computer and information technology skills. This was in
large part caused by low government salaries compared with the private sector, and also
caused significant delay and disruption.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
None
5.4 Costs and financing:
While total project financing comprised US$ 20.8 million, US$ 2 million of savings were
cancelled during the mid-term review.
Except for the poverty monitoring component, the original five-year project was largely
completed in accordance with the original schedule, on December 31, 1998. The poverty
-9-



monitoring component was delayed due to a contract dispute resulting in the Government's 1998
cancellation of the foreign firm's contract, causing the closing date to be extended until December
31, 1999 to allow for completion of this component. Subsequently, it was decided to conduct an
assessment of the effectiveness of the SSN-supported social assistance program at reaching the
poor -- this study was made a condition of the Social Sector Adjustment Credit (SOSAC)
program, and the SSNP was used to finance the related technical assistance. This activity led to a
further extension of the project closing to April 30, 2000. During this period, although it had not
been previously planned, SSNP provided six updated servers, software, and $120,000 to retrofit
MLSP personal computers originally procured in 1995 under SSNP, to meet Y2K requirements.
These activities were financed from savings in procurement of goods and services, and while not
initially envisioned, were highly supportive of project objectives. Supervision activities for the last
two years were focused on monitoring the status of the completed major TA contracts and goods
financed under the Credit, and assisting in the completion of these new activities.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
For the overall SSNP, sustainability is unlikely. For the Poverty Monitoring component,
sustainability is likely. For this component, agency capacity has been enhanced substantially,
many policy-makers and other users value the data and analytic outputs, and funding problems
were not noted. However, capacity created in Natstatkom is narrowly-focused, and the agency is
likely to require additional assistance to sustain the household surveys.
For the Social Assistance component, sustainability is unlikely. While the new law is in place, and
changes in agency policies and procedures have been made, the durability of the reforms is
uncertain, and a recent assessment of beneficiaries has found many classification errors.
For the Employment Service component, sustainability is highly unlikely. While agency capacity
has been enhanced, much of it is dependent on an outdated computer system. Budgetary funding
for computer repair, maintenance, and replacement is inadequate. Inadequate funding also
diminishes agency internal training and use of active measures to stimulate employment. Salary
levels are low, staffing levels are down, and turnover is high.
For the training component, while some benefits will endure, overall sustainability is judged as
highly unlikely. SSNP recommendations to consolidate the number of vocational schools were
not imnplemented, so budgetary resources continued to be stretched by the existing system. Many
physical facilities-including those renovated as well as remaining centers-are decaying, and
funding to repair, maintain, and replace equipment provided by the SSNP is not likely to be
adequate.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regullar operations:
Continued progress in the areas covered by the SSNP was facilitated by implementation of the
Social Sector Adjustment Credit (SOSAC), approved in December, 1998, and completed in April,
2000.
- 10-



The main thrust of SOSAC was to help the Government establish a fiscally sustainable pension
scheme. However, concerning the poverty monitoring component, SOSAC provided support to
Natstatkom to assure that the current sample size was maintained and provided technical advice
on data management and analysis. The SOSAC also supported an assessment of the effectiveness
of the targeting mechanism under the Unified Monthly Benefit (UMB) that had been developed
under the SSNP program (noted above). In the area of active labor market measures, SOSAC
supported an assessment of the effectiveness of active labor market programs, closed those
programs that were deemed least effective, and also assisted the Government to formulate an
action plan to improve program implementation and monitoring. Technical assistance supported
by the Government of Switzerland was made available to the MLSP and Social Fund to pursue
studies on related social sector topics (i.e., disability certification procedures and Social Fund
accounting).
The above-mentioned SOSAC targeting study and active labor market study will be critical inputs
into IDA's dialogue with the government on the forthcoming Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP), as well as the CDF. Since 1998, IDA has also been supporting an annual Poverty
Update that assesses household income, consumption and behavior drawing on the
SSNP-supported household surveys, and this ESW has also been a critical input into the IDA
dialogue with the country.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.] Lending:
Bank performance in lending was satisfactory. On the positive side, Bank coordination
with other financiers was excellent. Meetings in Europe, Washington, and in Bishkek with the
Fund, EU/TACIS, GTZ, and other financiers were very effective in coordinating assistance. The
one exception to this was the position taken by TACIS early in the project disagreeing with the
Bank on the need to raise the pension age. And the independent PCU was, on balance, an
effective mechanism for project implementation. Its independent status insulated it to a
substantial degree from Ministerial pressures regarding, e.g., procurement. No problems were
identified on the financial audits, however, the last one is as yet incomplete.
However, as noted earlier, the project design was complex, with four components involving
different disciplines and expertise. In retrospect, supervision resources were inadequate, especially
considering the additional supervision burden caused by the failure of the bank holding the project
funds and the Government's termination of the contract supporting the poverty monitoring
component.
Also, as noted earlier, insufficient attention was paid during project identification and appraisal to
the decrepit condition of most of the vocational schools.
7.2 Supervision:
Supervision was unsatisfactory. Supervision of the project according to the original design was
adequate, but supervision was not flexible and proactive in adapting to changing country
circumstances, expanding Bank knowledge of this transition economy, and feedback from project
- 11 -



implementation experience:
SSNP supervision resources were not effectively allocated. As noted earlier, project
design was complex, with four components involving different disciplines and expertise.
Resources were stretched thin, especially toward the end of the project (even as the team dealt
with the failure of Mercury Bank and termination of the consultant contract in the Poverty
Monitoring component). However, supervision resources were overly-concentrated in project
management and operational specialists, with insufficient resources for specialist supervision
of the four components. As the project progressed, the Bank teams noted increasing difficulty
in mobilizing technical resources to support the four components. Bank management did not
effectively address these issues.
* Bank supervision did not adequately address the need flexibly to redirect the project in
accordance with the assessment of the effectiveness of project components. In particular, a
1996 supervision mission rated the project as unsatisfactory, and detailed significant problems,
but there was little in the way of follow-through. While numerous missions--most notably the
October, 1996, mid-term review--identified sustainability as "the major issue," progress was
not made in this area, and at project close overall sustainability is rated as unlikely.
The employment service component was based on the assumption that the Kyrgyz
economy would produce enough new jobs to justify bolstering training and job counseling
services. This turned out to be unrealistic, severely limiting the extent to which an enhanced
ES capacity could contribute to Kyrgyz economic development. However, Bank supervision
was not flexible and pro-active in seeking to restructure the project in accordance with these
realities.
Supervision of the training component was weak. Missions repeatedly made
recommendations regarding system consolidation and streamlining and the implications for
sustainability, but little or no progress was made. The December, 1998, IPS evaluation noted
numerous recommendations from earlier IPS evaluations that had not been implemented.
* As noted earlier, there were major deficiencies in procurement concerning the training
component. Although most project procurement was conducted satisfactorily, these
deficiencies constitute a significant project shortcoming.
There was inadequate attention to maintaining a policy dialogue with the government,
which could have enhanced the achievement of development benefits.
It should be noted that the Borrower contribution asserts that the Bank showed adequate flexibility duning implementation.
This ICR concurs that there was reasonable operational flexibility (e.g., project extensions, administrative matters) but notes
that there was insufficient substantive flexibility with respect to implementing project strategies and achieving development
objectives.
7.3 Overall Bankpeiformance:
Overall Bank performance is judged to be unsatisfactory. Although many dedicated staff worked
diligently and with determination on the SSNP, the project implementation nevertheless had many
- 12 -



deficiencies.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Borrower performance in project preparation was marginally satisfactory. Kyrgyz agencies
worked diligently with Bank staff and the TA teams working on the project. Preparation was
better in the Poverty Monitoring and Social Assistance components than in the Training and
Employment Service. Fluctuating Borrower ownership of the project can be attributed to the fact
that this was a new post-Soviet country, with counterparts that were learning policy-making skills
for the first time. Project preparation workshops were well-attended, but participation was
passive--officials were grappling with new concepts such as "technical assistance" and "project
monitoring," some of which had no meaningful translation into the Russian or Kyrgyz languages.
It is useful to note that Kyrgyz attitudes and knowledge have changed substantially, and capacity
has grown significantly, over the period of the SSNP.
7.5 Govern,nent implementation peiforniance:
Implementation performance was marginally satisfactory. The main deficiency was the turbulence
in personnel at all levels-a factor that hindered performance throughout the project. New
ministers and component coordinators had to learn and relearn the SSNP.
However, the government did pass necessary legislation, including a new law on social
benefits, effective in January, 1998, as well as implementing regulations. New regulations
establishing benefit levels for social assistance, and new eligibility criteria for unemployment
compensation, were promulgated as agreed. Cooperation in the poverty monitoring component
was excellent. Agreed-upon counterpart funds were provided, albeit with a delay. However, most
agreed-upon reforms in the training component were never implemented, hindering progress in
this area.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Performance of the implementing agency was highly satisfactory. Financial management, staffing,
and overall project management were managed in a highly professional and effective manner.
Procurement (other than the training component) was handled in an effective manner, especially
considering the Borrower's lack of experience and geographic isolation. (A great deal of
equipment was ordered from foreign suppliers) All reporting, financial audits, and other
requirements were handled efficiently, and with no hints of the influence of corruption.
Implementation was achieved on a timely basis, with the exception of the poverty
monitoring component, whose performance was delayed by the collapse of Mercury Bank and the
termination of the contract with the consultant.
7.7 Overall Borrower peilborrance:
Borrower performance overall was marginally satisfactory. While as noted earlier there
were clearly shortfalls in performance, on balance--and considering the Kyrgyz level of capacity
during the period of the SSNP--it is judged that performance was marginally satisfactory, with
positive accomplishments modestly outweighing shortcomings.

8. Lessons Learned
Supervision Should have been More Flexible and Proactive--Several years into the
project, it had become evident that some components were not performing as envisioned. Bank
management should have taken a more proactive approach, and restructured the project to fit the
emerging realities.
Greater Attention Should have been Paid to Sustainability-As shown in Figure 1,
Kyrgyz budgetary resources were extremely limited, and this raises substantial doubts concerning
the sustaimability of all four SSNP components. Both in design and execution, the project should
have placed greater emphasis on how the benefits could be sustained in the uncertain
macroeconomic climate.
Greater Attention Should have been paid to Policy and Structural Reform--The
SSNP was not linked to any adjustnent operations and had no mechanisms for conditionality. In
hindsight, it would have been more effective to analyze more fully and address existing policy and
structural weaknesses, linking the approach taken in each component to ongoing improvements in
the policy framework.
An Independent PCU was Sensible-On balance, the decision to locate the PCU
outside of any individual Ministry was wise, and probably avoided undue influence on, e.g.,
procurement.
Better Procurement Planning was Needed-In some instances, procurement actions
were taken without a firn understanding of conditions on the ground. The project should have
developed and then rigorously implemented systematic, detailed, and carefully-phased
procurement plans for each component (including substantial input from end-users), based on an
objective understanding of the realities in that area.

include development of feasibility studies to create non-governmental pension fimds, and
in this respect amount was increased again for USD 59,000.00 in the second addition to
the contract. Because of reduction of the technical assistance on the Training Component,
addition was included into the contract and its amount was decreased within the limits of
U-JSD 100,000.00. Also because of decreasing training abroad for the local specialists,
contract amount on Evaluation Component was reduced within the limits of USD
50,000.00. During four years four additions to the contract on project monitoring were
issued because of some reasons. They were connected with increasing of volume of work
with foreign consultant, than his work continuing to provide initial assistance on "Social
Safety Net Project", and continuing further procurements at the expense of saved funds.
In connection with these additions, total contract amount was increased for USD
235,000.00. All mentioned changes and additions were in correspondence with World

World Bank satisfied this requirement, and PCU continued purchases on the
above-mentioned measures, basing on applications of managers of Components. Further
purchases were mainly conducted through International Shopping procedure (IS) and
bidding amounts varied from USD 10,000.00 to USD 100,000.00. Cumulated table on all
procurements attached
In connection with the fact, that because of different reasons, contract with RTI
institute (USA) was canceled. And this institute assisted Natstatcom in project
implementation, it was agreed with World Bank to continue work independently and use
USD 665,632.00, taken from unused amount of USD 861,109.73 on the contract with
RTI, for separate contract with Natstatcom till the end of 1999.
Thus, Social Safety Net Project was finished on December 31, 1998 on three
Components: Employment Service, Social Protection and Training; and total saved funds
made up USD 1,558,278.82 as of April 1, 1999, this amount includes saved funds on all

connected with the last procurement of equipment on Y2000 problem, and also for audit
for 1998 and 1999, considering the contract of Natstatcom, USD 794,919.27 will stay
unused as minimum. It shows that from the total amount of USD 17,000,000.00 on credit



agreement between Govermnent of the Kyrgyz Republic and Intemational Development
Association, there were factually spent USD 16,205,000.00. It will be possible to clarify
more detailed amount only after finishing Poverty Monitoring Component
implementation and the last payment for audit, which will be conducted in the end of
1999. Complete table on financial situation as of April 1, 1999 attached
GENERAL CONCLUSIONS
Reports, composed by beneficiaries, about finishing of three Components of
Social Safety Net Project enclosed to this explanatory note. As it was mentioned above,
results on achievement of tasks and objectives were fully depended on managers of the
Components and their staff, involved into project implementation. PCU would like to
mention that high staff turnover and change of managers of the Components
influenced negatively to the project implementation. For example, manager of the major
Social Protection Component was replaced five times. Minister Shustikov started project
design development in cooperation with specialists attracted by World Bank. Minister
Khakimov managed during project implementation. Than there were three more
replacements during two years: Ms. Abdurekhmenova, Mr. Rysaliev; final report was
composed by the last Minister, Ms. Dzhangaracheva. Considering the fact, that each new
Minister attracted new specialists, no specialists, who started project implementation, left.
Component coordinator was replaced four times, and it is key position in
achievement of objectives, working in cooperation with foreign consultants.
Analogous situation was on all components. Manager of Employment Service
Conmponent was replaces three times, and it was one year Component, i.e. Mr.
Runiyantsev and Ms. Sayakbayeva do not work for a long time, and new manager of
department, Ms. Ryskulova, who works during the last six months, does not know
everything. Coordinator of the Component also was changed four times, and coordinator
did not compose final report, specialist, who was not involved into the project earlier,
composed it, what makes doubtful complete evaluation of positive results received.
Manager of Training Component also was replaced three times (Mr. Kasendeev, Mr.
Toktogulov, Mr. Askarov), and there were two coordinators. Chairman of the
Supervisory Board was replace four times, during project implementation First Vice-
Prime Ministers were A.M. Matubraimov, A.T. Tagaev, K.K. Nanaev, B.I. Silaev.
That is why staff turnover and permanent replacement of managers influences
success receiving during project implementation, i.e. initial directions of the end
objectives were lost, and sometimes each new manager of Component had no full
understanding of implementation of measures included according to project design.
Also it should be mentioned, that there were some replacements in World Bank. Project
managers were Mr. B. Dalborg and Ms. C. Hoppy, and several consultants of the project
were replaced. But in spite of replacements in World Bank, there was continuity of
project management and implementation of objectives, what can not be said about our
replacements. The other problem was the lack of exact mutual understanding on
planned measures, defined by project design and receiving results. After one and a
half year during project implementation, some high authorities both in Government and
President Administration wondered. why some measures (procurements) should be done,
4



-and demanded to pay pensions and benefits from  the credit funds. These
misunderstandings show that inexperienced or accidental people participate in World
Bank project design from our side, or there is absolutely no mechanism of project
objectives' definition between institutions involved into the process of receiving of
credit lines. May be governors of the Republic also do not know about the final
project design and measures within the project, including the package of planned
procurements. Further, when new specialists come at all levels, situation is aggravated
and the same misunderstandings appear. Of course, there were objective reasons, political
and economical situation changes and requires to correct both real life of the country in
general and some projects in particular, but these changes should be valid and correspond
final objectives, and should not brake concluded agreements. Moreover, it should not be
forgotten that World Bank is bureaucratized enough, and it is practically impossible to
change strategic objectives and particularly the major objective. Nevertheless, it is
possible to include some tactical changes on some measures, because World Bank is able
to be "flexible" in some degree. The only required thing was to explain suggestion
precisely. But some our managers of the components wanted to buy anything, no matter
what for their Ministry, what caused slowing of project implementation in general,
because offers did not satisfied project managers of World Bank.
All this means that it can be equally concluded that:
A. There was no need in Social Safety Net Project, because these objectives can not be
achieved in present situation, or project tasks were defined wrong;
B. Social Safety Net Project proved fully to be essential and required results were
achieved;
C. Social Safety Net Project was useful for the Republic very much and certain base
was created to continue work in this sector.
I suppose, that general objectives are achieved, and if there were no above
mentioned problems, project success would be felt more. Specialists gained experience
on mechanism of population social address development, and material base (office and
training) equipment was procured, what is most important, because work in this direction
can be continued with this base.
The most important thing now is to save all procured equipment, and it is required
that financing will be planned for maintenance, purchasing of consumables and
equipment safety at places, because a lot of equipment was procured, installed and
spread in the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic. The other negative moments are that
there is turnover of specialists, trained with this equipment, especially in
countryside, and it is impossible to use the full power of the equipment (computers,
copy machines) and provide its safety because of different reasons - lack, increasing
or decreasing of electric energy, insufficient quality of the new specialists,
insufficient control of MLSP officers for the right usage of equipment on the places.
Any way new experience gained during project implementation in the social
sphere and with World Bank credit funds gave positive knowledge for all sides
participated in its implementation and especially to the local specialists. Considering
made mistakes, and accept some recommendations of received project evaluation, it will
be possible to fulfill tasks underdone by this project and prepare better for
implementation of such projects in future. It should be added, that experience received



during project implementation, allows PCU to continue successful work without
assistance of the foreign consultants on the other project - Health Sector Reform Project
form the credit finds of World Bank.

FINAL REPORT
THE "POVERTY MONITORING" COMPONENT
INITIAL SUM: 2.436.626,00 USD
SECOND SUM
(After the Contract termination with the RTI Consultative firm): 665.632,00 USD
THE PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The collection of the accurate information is an important tool in monitoring the
processes of economy reform, in particular at determination of their influence on the
poverty and unemployment, as well as in social programme development directed at
the efficient social protection of the population.
The Project priority task was to introduce changes to the system of the household
budget survey and undertake its reforming. The necessity in significant changes for
the present household budgets survey system caused by the change in the data
collection methodology change and. study of transition from the command economy
to the market oriented one. New social indicators, such as health, education, as well
as income, employment, consumption, nutrition and others were to establish for the
new survey system a possibility to meet requirements in the information of all the
ministries and agencies interfacing with the social sector. In this way it would be
possible to avoid unnecessary duplication of the same data collection by the other
establishments, that is available at the National Statistical Committee. It was
intended to undertake the population living standards information collection among
the same households that were involved at the income and expenditure surveys for
the analysis of the social indicators changes, taking place at the economic reforms
period.
The main components of the Living Standards Measurement Program were:
1. Versatile survey of the household, covering the structure of the economy and
family members responsibilities, housing conditions, education level of family
members, health status, employment, unofficial occupation in the agriculture and
other branches of the economy, migration, expenses and other sources of
income, nutrition and anthropometric features;
2. Application of the questionnaires with the step and probe questions and
questions mainly coded beforehand. As a rule, questions related to the
respondents' habitation place, a questionnaire date etc were not coded;
3. Application of the direct questions across all the Questionnaire data to the
respondents above 14 years living at the family;
4. The high control level, attitude of controllers to the respondents;
5. Simultaneous data entry;
6. Additional data on social services, infrastructure, economic possibilities;
7. The price data, determination of the regional prices variation.



THE "POVERTY MONITORING" PROJECT TASKS AND WAYS OF THEIR
IMPLEMENTATION
The Project was to assist the National Statistical Committee (NSC) to establish
conditions needed for the new system of the household's survey. The new system for
the household survey was to be based on the former NSC experience as well as on
the World Bank accumulated experience in the monitoring development and the
basic survey review, undertaken at the Kyrgyz Republic in 1993.
The Project task is of important meaning for the National Statistics development, the
Republican population living standards measurement during the planned economy
transition period towards the market oriented one.
To achieve the main Component tasks in accordance with the Credit Agreement for
the "Social Safety Net" Project signed in 1995 the Project Co-ordination Unit on
behalf of the KR Government concluded a contract for a Technical Assistance with
the "RTI" Firm (USA) to the amount of 2.436.626,00 USD. To assist works on the
"Poverty Monitoring" Component the Project Co-ordination Unit (PCU) concluded two
additional separate contracts. The first contract was for purchase of 64 computers,
that to be installed at the NSC and at the Oblast and Raion Statistical Committees for
entry and analysis of the survey data, and the office equipment to the amount of
248.728,00 USD. The second contract was for purchase of 12 "Jeep" automobiles to
the amount of 324,995,0 USRS for the Oblast Statistic Committees to undelake
surveys. These Contracts were of significant importance for the successful works of
the "Poverty Monitoring" Component.
THE "POVERTY MONITORING" COMPONENT ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTATION
BY THE KR NSC AND THE CONSULTATIVE FIRM FROM THE NORTH
CAROLINE STATE (RTI)
In July 1995 the appointed Project Director and the representative from the North
Caroline Research Institute (RTI) Contract Department arrived to Kyrgyzstan to
undertake negotiations with the "Social Safety Net" Project Co-ordination Unit (PCU),
to conclude the four year technical assistance provision contract for the "Poverty
Monitoring" Component works. This Component aimed at undertaking of Kyrgyzstan
population annual surveys during 4 years, from 1996 to 1999. The implementation of
the Contract was intended in cope with the KR National Statistical Committee. After
successful negotiations and approvement of the Conditions by the World Bank, the
official date for the Contract in force was set up for the July 24, 1995. The
management of the Scientific Institute from the North Caroline State (RTI)
immediately started planning works on the Contract and preparation of the Project
Director's arrival to Bishkek.
It was necessary to provide the Government with the information base on the
Republican population living level status, because the main goal of the "Social Safety
Net" Project was the improvement of the most vulnerable layers of population
determination mechanism and improvement of the social programs efficiency. That is
why at once after the Project works started, the management of the NSC,
responsible for the "Poverty Monitoring" Component works co-ordination, due to the
acute necessity in the poverty data, expressed an intention to move the survey start
to the winter period of 1995-1996, instead of the planned terms in spring/summer
1996. Considering time limitations for the preparation and the survey itself, RTI and
NSC were to use practically same method in the sample construction and same
questionnaire program that were used at the basic survey in 1993 conducted with the



help of Moscow specialists. This plan was most appropriate to receive the survey
data as earlier as possible.
The representative of the RTI, being a Project Director, on arrival to Bishkek at the
beginning of the September 1995, started preparations at once for the first survey.
At the initial stage of the Project there was intended to include to the modification of
the survey the review and establishment of the sample plan, representing the total
population of the Republic.
The NSC used sample methods developed in 50-ies for the survey of the
household budget until 1997. Such sample in the history of the soviet statistics of
the population budget surveys is called the territorial-branchial sample.
Evaluating results of the selected survey of households at the transition period
towards the marked oriented economy, it is worth to note, that in the past under the
conditions of state regulating the population income, the even distribution of many
material goods in the society, the survey on the basis of the territorial-branchial
sample was mainly satisfying state organs and economic institutions needs with the
according information.
The sharp changes in distribution of goods are noted at present transition period
.codditions. The new social groups of population with the different income sources a,e
appearing; their consumption level differs strongly. Under present situation the
methods of organising the selected surveys of households require serious
improvement by applying more perfect sampling methods, that would provide
representative data on the living standard in total across the Republic and its regions.
In the many countries of the world there accumulated a rich experience in the social
information collection, related to all the population by applying the territorial samples
of households. Studying this experience, the NSC in co-operation with the
consultants-economists from the Institute of North Caroline state (USA), have come
to the conclusion that the representative data could be received by applying the
method of the territorial sampling of the survey items - households, from their sample
frame build by the random sampling.
The data of the household survey, based on the random systematic sample
method enabled to present the information for the different issues:
* The Republic poverty and unemployment characteristics;
* The sources and importance of the poor layers of population
income at different regions, type of property owned by poor;
* The consumption character and type among low income
population across different urban and rural regions;
* Social service and infrastructure access for poor, etc.
The data received is effectively utilised in the process of the state regulating the life
of society, and in assessment of managerial decisions' impact.
The important component of the 4-year contract between RTI and NSC was the work
with Users Group, who acted as an Observation Council at the survey results
utilisation issues.
9



The Users' Group consisted of representatives from the KR President's
Administration, KR Government Administration, KR Ministry of Finances, Ministry of
Labour and Social Protection, Healthcare Ministry, Education Ministry, Ministry for
Agriculture and Water Economy. The primary task of this Group is an assistance at
development of questionnaires for the annual surveys and familiarisation with the
every survey data, as well as presentation of data to the according ministries. This
Group was to present requests for the needed tables and assist in their development,
aiming to avail latter to the ministries and the Government.
There were concluded agreements with the mentioned ministries on co-operation
and appointment of ministries' representatives to the Users' Group. The Users were
given an information about what analytical tables and materials would be needed for
the ministries on the survey end and the times of their publishing.
However, there should be noted that often replacement of the ministries and
agencies heads brought a negative influence on the successful co-operation within
the Users' Group. The Users' Group initial staff has been always changing, and the
National Statistics Committee had to constantly undertake an additional work on
familiarisation of the Group representatives with their role in the Group activity.
The meetings with the Users' Group were held mainly after receiving the first results
of a survey. At those meetings there were considered and discussed in details the
iasults of the household survey data analysis. The Users' Group representatives
were to carefully study and utilise the survey data during an agency's activity. The
National Statistical Committee sent the Final Reports with the survey analysis results
to the entire Republican Ministries and agencies.
The most important goal of the TA Contract was an education and involvement of
the NSC employees in the development and undertaking of such national
investigations in future. The priority in this case is the change of existing in the NSC
survey system, as well as the data collection and analysis of changes methodology,
taking place at the transition period from the planned system towards the marked
relations in developing the economy of the state.
The training of the NSC specialists was also a main task. These specialists would be
responsible for such survey components as: sampling, questionnaire development,
preparation of surveys, co-ordination of surveys, data entry, data processing, data
analysis and development of reports. These specialists were greatly involved in the
survey work and have been continually trained during the Contract period. Besides
that, they took part at the special training programmes, developed by the World Bank
and RTI specialists and consultants. The training took place as well as in Kyrgyzstan
and in USA, and availed the NSC to dispose with the educated specialists able to
undertake the all aspect surveys.
In the relation to the Kyrgyz Government's request to reduce the foreign Technical
Assistance, the "Poverty Monitoring" Component Co-ordinators applied all the
possible efforts to maximally involve local specialists in the annual surveys. But it
was necessary to involve foreign consultants in the component work to train the NSC
specialists the survey organisation and undertaking methods. Probably the
participation of the foreign consultants would be to the lesser extent, then it was
described in the Contract Conditions.
The accumulated experience will help the NSC to continue surveys on the living
standards of population at the Republic using the international experience.

THE POPULATION LIVING STANDARDS SURVEY CONTINUATION
WITH THE RETENTION OF ACHIEVED RESULTS ON THE COMPONENT AND
PROVISION OF ITS STABILITY
Aimed at the improvement of organisation on the scientific basis the statistics of the
Republican population welfare study, provision of "Poverty Monitoring" Project stable
continuation, and considering all the positive and negative moments at the local and
international practice, the National Statistical Committee developed a plan to merge
two surveys (the survey for the "Poverty Monitoring" Project and systematic survey of
the household budgets, being undertaken by the NSC since 1952) and approved by
the Decision at its February 1998Collegium. The execution of all the planned
activities in accordance with the Two Surveys Merge Plan enabled to receive a new
quality survey that would include all the best methodology. Using this Plan as
Guidance, the NSC specialists have undertaken the preparatory work, consisted of
the following stages:
*  Review of the Questionnaires, used earlier;
*  Forming of the new network of the selective aggregation of households,
because starting with 1997 the Government allocated funds for the
extension of the surveyed households net up to 2030, to enable the
sample size to be same with the "Poverty Monitoring" Project;
*  Development of the set of tasks for the primary information entry;
*  Development by the programmists of the software for the data entry at
oblasts;
*  DataBase Processing and preparation of analytical materials on the
request of users will be undertaken using the "SPSS" program.
The first results of the survey with consideration of changes in questionnaires and
methods of sampling are already received on the totals of 1998. The received
DataBase was transferred to the SPSS program formats and sent in February 2000
to the World Bank for consideration.
It is worth to note here, that the sample size of 2000 households, determined at the
initial action stage of the "Poverty Monitoring" Project, proved to be insufficient, i.e.
some indicators, received during the survey, could not be constantly reliable and
reflect changes, taking place in the economy of the Republic. That is why, at the
1997 survey there was decided to increase the sample size from 2000 to 3000
households. The results of the entire republican population living standards
investigations, received during study of 3000 households at 1997-1998 proved to be
more representative.
The NSC made Presentations of these data for the Users' Group on the survey
results. The Republican Government, understanding the role of constant surveys of
changes at the living standards of population and social protection of the most
vulnerable layers of population, issued for the NSC funds to undertake a survey of
3000 households in the year 2000.
THE MAIN FACTORS INFLUENCED THE PROJECT REALISATION
In April 1998 after the long correspondence the co-operation under the Contract
between the National Statistical Committee and the Consultative Firm of the state
North Caroline (RTI) was terminated.
'if



At the moment of Contract termination with the RTI firm there were about 877.594,00
USD left as not allocated yet.
The NSC in May 1998 turned to the World Bank with the request to consider the
possibility of access to the left sum and assist in introduction of changes in the
Budget lines, stipulated by the Contract earlier the proposal on the new Budqet was
to te su  of 665i632,00 
The World Bank satisfied the request of the NSC regarding the independent
continuation of the Project realisation. Achieving an access to the left means enabled
to continue the Actions Plan on the successful completion of the "Poverty Monitoring"
Project.
Within the new budget under the permission of the World Bank the Government
Commission on the Co-ordination of Projects purchased new techniques and office
furniture to the amount of 63.500 USD (ihe necessity in commissioning the more
powerful technology raised with utilisation of the new software).
After the Contract termination with the RTI Firm the Kyrgyz Republic National
Statistical Committee developed the Action Plan for the successful continuation of
the Project. According this Plan the NSC was to use practically the same method of
the sample construction and the same Questionnaire program, that were used at
autumn 1996 and 1997 household surveys. This Plan was composed under time
limits that did not avail to introduce any changes, aimed also at the earliest survey
data. In the accordance with this plan there were undertaken following activities:
*  Continuation of the NSC specialists training the practical skills for the data
processing and the survey results analysis;
*  Acquisition of computers;
*  Preparation and undertaking the fourth survey;
*  Training specialists on the household sampling methods.
Training the NSC specialists abroad
,.2



The NSC personnel were not trained the practical skills for the data processing,
composition of the complicated variables for analysis and etc because the results of
the first two surveys were processed by the specialists of the Research Institute of
the North Caroline State in USA. That is why within the TA it was required to
undertake a practical training for NSC specialists on the methods of living standards
of population data analysis, this was organised through training the NSC specialists
on the basis of the present experience of foreign countries:
* On the sample construction;
* On development of the survey results with skills on composition of
complicated variables;
* On the data analysis and their review.
Such training established conditions for the successful continuity of the foreign
countries' experience and its utilisation in Kyrgyzstan. This experience enabled to
continue planned activities for the third survey and prepare and undertake the fourth
survey on the "Poverty Monitoring" Component.
The acquisition of new hardware.
Because the software used since 1995 in the NSC system become morally outdated
(WINDOWS 3.11) there raised a necessity to utilise new improved software products
(WINDOWS-95, SPSS 8.0 and others). But the capacity of the earlier commissioned
computing techniTires was insufficient for the new software utilisation during the
development of survey results. It is worth to note that at the same time the Kyrgys
Government requires the poverty information presentation not only nationally but
across regions as well. Relating to this, the sample size was extended from the 2000
households to the 3000 to ensure the representativeness. As a result the amount of
the database grew, and this required a change of the available techniques to the
more powerful computers.
PROBLEMS INFLUENCED ON THE PROJECT REALISATION AND LEARNED
LESSONS
As mentioned above, the Contract on the co-operation between NSC and
Consultative Firm RTI was terminated before the end of the Project itself. The reason
for this was refusal of the Firm representatives to train and transfer their working
experience to the NSC staff. The requirements of the NSC were grounded, because
the Project goal was in establishment of the new survey system for the living
standards measurement, where the international experience would be applied.
The co-operation problems between the NSC and Consultative Firm directly
influenced the timely completion of the Component in the terms set up by the "Social
Safety Net' Project (the end of 1998). As a result of this the NSC had to turn to the
Kyrgyz Government with the request to prolong the Project terms.
The second problem, that caused additional prolongation of the Project terms, was
the "Mercury" Bank bankruptcy, where the accounts of the "Social Safety Nef' Project
were allocated. Because of the Bank bankruptcy many of activities, planned for the
1999, were fallen through.



Training of the Users' Group
The information on the population living standards survey, especially new poverty
terms, are of significant importance for our Republic. That is why it is necessary to
train specialists of Kyrgyzstan (Users' Group), using the experience of the Western
Countries and Europe on the poverty problems investigation (survey), utilisation of
the received information to undertake monitoring of different economic reform
processes at development of effective decisions on the social protection of the
population. It was intended to undertake a week training for the Users' Group (10-12
people) based on the foreign colleagues' experience. But because of problems
caused by the "Mercury" Bank bankruptcy, where the finances of the Project were
installed, the training failed.
ACHIEVED RESULTS
The main goal of the Project on utilisation of the international experience was
achieved. At present time there are experienced specialists at the National Statistical
Committee, they can organise and undertake any selective surveys using received
experience.
The World Bank experts played an important role in achievement of these goals. The
NSC received good consultations regarding the "SPSS" program utilisation for the
data an4sl.s. The NSC-specialists had three weeks training for the data analysia at
thie World Bank in Washington. The gained working skills enabled the NSC
specialists develop a final report on the "Poverty Monitoring" survey results for 1997,
and publish them, also to continue analysis of the households survey results,
undertaken by the NSC in autumn 1998 independently from international experts
participation.
Besides that, the NSC put a lot of efforts to provide stabilisation of the population
living standards survey. This resulted in the above-mentioned merge of two surveys.
LEARNED LESSONS
During the "Poverty Monitoring" Component realisation the NSC staff gained good
skills on organisation and undertaking of surveys, forming a sample, development of
questionnaires, data analysis and so on. The most important skill for the NSC is a
development of Projects, Terms of References for the entire Project and consultants,
and ability to estimate correctly cost of certain activities implementation. All the
problems met during the "Poverty Monitoring" Component realisation served as good
possibility to assess positive and negative moments of the Project Conditions. The
gained experience will help the NSC in future to make up more literal Contracts with
consideration of the according financing size and efficient involvement of
international and local experts.
THE WORLD BANK EXECUTION OF THE PROJECT CONDITIONS
The realisation of the "Poverty Monitoring" Component was the most complicated
issue compared to the other components of the "Social Safety Net" Project. The NSC
successfully solved met problems thanks to the good understanding of the World
Bank management and its employees. The National Statistical Committee always
received good support from the World Bank management in solution of issues related
to the successful continuation of the "Poverty Monitoring" Component realisation. The
/e'



consideration of all the requests from the Kyrgyz Government side and taking
decisions on introduction of changes into the Contract Conditions once again prove
existing flexibility in the World Bank work.
The National Statistical Committee avails itself a possibility to express a special
gratitude to the World Bank staff, who provided every possible support at solving
problems with the Consultative Firm from the North Caroline State (RTI) and the
bankruptcy of the "Mercury" Bank. This support enabled to continue successfully the
Project realisation. The National Statistical Committee expresses its gratefulness for
the close co-operation and provided support to Mr. Mr. Kieshi Kodera, Mohinder
Muddahhar, Mrs. Carol Hoppy,
Mr. Anthony Lim, Mrs. Kinnon Scott, Mr. Salman Zaidi and Mrs. Dinara Djoldosheva.
The "Poverty Monitoring" Component Co-ordinator quarterly presented reports on the
"Project Realisation Process" during all the period of the Project activity.

MINISTRY OF LABOR AND SOCIAL PROTECTION
OF THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC
HEAD ADMINISTRATION
ON PROFESSIONAL TECffNICAL EDUCATION
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic together with the World Bank developed the
Social Safety Net Project. The main objective of this project was to increase
effectiveness of the social assistance, provided to the population by the government.
One of the major aspects of the social assistance is the professional training of
population. System of professional training, using the mechanism of the self-
employment of population, can decrease substantially the tense in the labor market.
With the current economical situation it would be impossible to expect solution of all
problems put to the Training Component of WB Project in the sphere of professional
training. But having developed the WB Credit, republican system of professional
training, received impulse for the further development basing on the clear
understanding of its strategic objectives and tactical aims.
The main objectives of the component were:
I. Development and implementation of adults' professional training and retraining
strategy, based on the real requirements. of the labor market of the Republic;
2. Reinforcement of the Head Administration on Professional Technical Education
(HAPTE);
3. Informational Center establishment;
4. Implementation of the module system of training;
5. Nine module centers establislhment.
In order to achieve the objectives, it was planned to renew material resources and
computerize all professional training system branches, used in the project and
provision of technical consultations on the whole range of problems put.
Procurement of equipment was made by PCU, technical consultations were made by
the Swiss Company AMU Gruppen together with the University of Ohio State, USA.
During implementation of Training Component, the following results were achieved:
* Strategy of policy in the sphere of professional training, including both initial
professional training of youth and training of adults, was developed;
* Cooperation of HAPTE and Employment Department was achiieved (90% of
unemployed adults are trained on the basis of vocational schools);
*  System of marketing research and job placement monitoring of vocational sclhools
graduates was developed;
* HAPTE and module centers personnel was trained in the sphere of marketing,
management and economy;
*  Vocational schools were given independence in placing incomes from provision
of paid services and product sales;
* Informational Center, attaclhed to HAPTE, was establislied;



*  Nine Module Centers were established on the following specialties: agriculture,
printing, constructioni, tourism, tracks repairing, cats repairing, restauralit and
hotel business, computer technologies, electrical engineering;
* Republican Scientific-Methodological Center tagether witlh pedagogical personnel
of the module centers developed and impternented the system of module training,
allowing to spread it further arnong vocationial schools;
Problems and difficulties appeared during project implementation:
*  Unjustified staff reduction and low level of salaries, causing its fluctuation;
*  Four Ministries of Labor and Social Protection and three 14APTE directors were
changed during project implementation, what influenced the effectiveness of
project implementation;
*  Long deiay in supply of equipmnent (till 18 monthls on some kinds of equipment)
caused frustration of terms in some project objectives;
i  Major part of equipment mnanuals were translated poorly or tlere were no
translations at all;
*  Suppliers of equipment did not provide its certification in the State Standard of the
Kyrgyz Republic, what caused large expenses for certification of equipment at the
expense of module centers;
*  Many foreign consultants had no experience in CIS countries;
a Total time reduction for technical consultations.
Despite separate troubles, project was implemented successfully enough, especially
considering that negative experience has rational elements, which will be taken into
account in the course of the other project implemetitatioi.
HAPTE of MLSP of the Kyrgyz Republic expresses gratitude for WB for the
performed credit, which development widened possibilities of professional training
system in the Republic and was a powerful stimulus for the further reforming of the
whole system for the welfare of Kyrgyz economy development.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SOCIAL"ASSISTANCE COMPONENT
SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROJECT
The main objective of the Component was social safety net reform by
implementation of the poverty detecting mechanism, providing address social
assistance to the poor fanmilies and persons.
The following objectives were achieved within the frames of the Project:
* The new model of address social safety system of the poor sirata of the
population was implemented;
*  Pernanently actitng experimental centers were establislied in thie social
service, providing  approbation, evaluation  of live  activity  and
mnanagement, structure of any innovations in the sphere of the social
protection;
*  Departmnental structure of incompetent payments detectiont and struggle
with machinationis in the sphere of the social protection was developed;
* New model of the address social protection was computerized;
*  Training departmental structure was implemented.
The main component objective was achieved: personal model of the
govemnmental social protection functions, combining status of the republican economy
and the real evaluation of poverty, promoting the increase of citizens' and faamilies'
responsibility for their financial condition. Expenses for social paymentts were
reduced for 30%, number of receivers - for 50% (in comparison witll 1995).
Componetnt proved itself fully and required objectives were achieved.
Major factors influenced lthe project implementation and its result:
I. Untimely and incomplete financing of all kinds of social paynients. All
preconditions made by this project to improve management of the social

MINISTRY OF LABOR AND SOCIAL PROTECTION
STATE EMPLOYMENT DEPARTMENT
During evaluation of the Implementation Completion Report oii Social Safety Net
Project in the middle of the March of the current year, meeting of Ms. Ryskulova,
Head of State Employment Department, held with the representative of the World
Bank, Mr. E. Hurwitz. There was agreed to provide Ms. Joldosheva information about
this meeting.
Ms. Ryskulova mentioned that she did not work during this project implementation
and is unable to give evaluation unbiased enough, as it would be if she worked
directly during above-mentioned period. But she said that project activity results are
effective enough. She emphasized that thanks to the project, state employment service
was the first who was provided with the office equipment, measures on computer
system  Trud implementation were made, directed for labor automation of
employment service specialists of all levels. System implementation allowed having
computer registration of unemployed citizens. It was further planned to combine
MLSP computer system and implement it into the state computer network of the
Republic. But in connection with the unstable work of phone lines and the lack of
funds for payment of communication service, the final objective was not achieved
now. But existing database gives the opportunity to exchange computer information
with such organizations as Social Fund and Compulsory Medical Insurance Fund,
react operatively for all changes on the regional labor markets. Besides, it reduces
time of unemployed servicing.
Ms. Ryskulova informed Mr. Hurwitz that one of Credit circumstances was to
increase staff of State Employment Department (former Head Administration of
Employment) up to 61 persons, and she supposed that it was a mistake and there was
no need in this. For example: now the staff of department makes up 38 persons, and
the level of work staid the same and even higher.
According to Ms. Ryskylova, the project -objective was put incorrect initially. She
thinks, that it was a mistake to implement the Australian system of employment
service in our Republic, having the present social-economical situationi formed in our
Republic during last years, because it achieved no results for unemployed to look for
work by visiting employers with declarations about benefits receiving and work
searching.
Ms. Ryskulova also mentioned that the idea of model centers establishment in all
regions of the republic, planned in the project, was not implemented mainly because
of the lack of professional skills of employment service specialists and their aversion
of new working standards (together with system computerizing, all data are manually
processed).
It was mentioned as positive that 14 offices weTe repaired at the expense of project
funds practically in all regions of the Republic in the amount of 914 tllousand Kyrgyz
soms.



It is also positive, thiat WB recommended the toughening of terms of unemployment
benefits payment in 1996, and experts recommended that onily unemployed, whio
made contributions into the fund (Employment Assistance Fund), slhould receive
unemployment benefits.
In the process of Project implementation, system of uiemployinmet benefits payment
was reviewed for unemiiployed, who live far and in high mountainous regions of thie
Republic. The new inechanism, envisaging altemative ways of benefits payment was
impletnented. Positions of agents servicing unemployed people living far and in high
mountainous regions were established. During the period from 1993 to 1996, 123
agents worked in the system of employment service, more than 70 tlhousands of
unemployed used their service;
At the end Ms. Ryskulova mentioned that project implementation allowed developing
and strengthening of systems, providing services lo unemployed, of Governmental
Employment Department, analysis and development of employment politics, audit
and financial management made by the Employment Assistance Fund, etc.

Dear Mr. Kodera
RK: Implementation Completion Report
(IDA-26430; COFN-03330; TF-26206)
Social Safety N,et Project
We have carefuJly revised the lmnplementation Completion Report on the above Project, and
would like to note the importance of the conclusions and recommendations made in the
Report as weIl as information on the project's implementation and outcome evaluation.
In addition to the comments and remarks that were sent earlier in our Contribution we would
like to draw your attention to the following.
The Social Safety Net Project was the first investment project that has been carried out by
the IDA in the Kyrgyz Republic. There had been only very limited experience in such
targeted social assistance programs. Considering the nature and the complex design of the
Project we would like to note that the Bank showed sufficient adequate flexibility during
implementation and the Project achieved its main objectives due to the cooperative efforts
and mutual understanding of the Bank's management team and the Kyrgyz authorities to
solve the emerging problems.
Despite lack of experience with such operation in the Kyrgyz Republic the Bank performed
satisfactorily and the Bank's staff provided every possible support at solving problems.
Accordingly we would like to confirm our comments sent earlier once again.
Sincerely yours,
Sabyrbek Moldolculov
