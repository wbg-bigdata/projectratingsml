MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KYRGYZ REPUBLIC FOR A SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROJECT
1.    I submit for youI approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the Kyrgyz Republic for SDR12.0 million, the equivalent of US$17.0 million, on standard IDA
temis with a maturity of 35 years, to help finance a Social Safety Net Project. The Project would be
cofinanced through a grant from the Government of Switzerland in the amount of Swiss Francs 4.0
million, the equivalent of about US$ 2.7 million, to be administered by the Association.
2.    Background. The Kyrgyz Government's reform program requires price liberal'zation, privatization
and restructuring of public enterprises. As in other FSU Republics, the social effects of trade dislocation
and reform are severe, with high inflation, collapsing living standards, reduced health care provision, and
growing unemployment. To address these problems, the Govermment, with policy advice from the
Association, has adopted a strategy for social protection which stresses improved zargeting of those in
need and improved delivery of social services within the limits set by fiscal constraints. Specifically, the
Association's policy and strategy recommendations for the social sectors include the separation of social
assistance from social insurance and the strengthening of a recently created Social (insurance) Fund,
adoption of a new, consolidated family benefit, a new system for targeting social assistance, and
simplifications in the pension system. The implementation of these recommendations would be ersured
through (a) conditionality under the proposed project to the extent necessary to ensure efficient project
implementation and full development impact and (b) strengthening, under the proposed project, of
institutional capacities to plan and deliver social safety net and related services in support of-reform.
3.    Proiect Objectives. This would be a capacity building operation aimed at improving mechanisms
to identify the poor and make social programs more effective and efficient in targeting and delivering
social assistance, especially to the most vulnerable groups. The project would also make employment
services and training more efficient and effective in assisting the unemployed, particularly through an
improved capability to deliver unemployment benefits, and in promoting thie redeployment of labor.
4.    Project Description. The proposed project would have a duration of four years and would
comprise four main components as follows:
(a)   the social assistance reform component (base cost $6.7 million) would provide equipment,
technical assistance and training to strengthen the capacity of the Department of Social Protection of the
Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (.iLSP) to provide targeted social assistance, including cash and
in-kind benefits, and mobilize NGOs and community organizations to enhance such assistance. It would
include support for policy formulation and the development of a new social assistance delivery system,
the simplification of pension calculation and delivery, the retraining of staff, and the reequipping of
offices;
(b)   the poverty and unemplovment monitoring component ($3.4 million) would provide equipment,
technical assistance and training to strengthen the capacity of the State Committee for Statistics to carry
out representative surveys, especially of poverty and unemployment, in order to provide enhanced
information and guidance to social agencies in improving the targeting and delivery of support services;
(c)   the employment set ,ices component ($2.7 million) would provide equipment, technical assistance
and training to strengthen the capacity of the Emnployment Service (ES) under the MLSP to (i) process
and pay unemployment benefits to laid-cff workers; (ii) create a capacity to accelerate the redeployment
of unemployed workers to productive activity through counseling, placement, and referral to retraining;



-2-
and (iii) develop a program to handle mass lay-offs. It would also include (iv) provision for a pilot
program to facilitate the transfer of social assets of restructured enterprises to local authorities; and
(d)   the training component ($5.2 million) would provide technical assistance, training, equipment and
materials to ensure the availability of a minimum capacity to respond to market demand for tiaining in
key skill areas needed in a market economy through short, flexible training programs for persons wishing
to upgrade their skills or change careers, including unemployed workers and persons ir risk of being laid
off by restructuring enterprises. Training programs and materials developed under the project would be
made available to all interested training users and providers to encourage the development of a
competitive market for training. To keep costs low, publicly provided training programs would use
existing facilities of the State Committee for Training under cost recovery arrangements. The quality and
demand-driven character of training would be further assured through institutionalized, close cooperation
with public and private enterprises and the employment services in the determination of training
specializations, and other policy actions described in an agreed policy statement.
5.    Project Implementation.  While discrete project components would be implemented by the
respective implementing agency or department, overall coordination and common implementation
functions (project accounting, procurement, and disbursement) would be entrusted to a Project
Coordination Unit (PCU). The PCU would report to the First Deputy Prime Minister (who is responsible
for social policy at the highest policy level of the Government) and would be staffed with a Director, an
accountant, a secretary, a technical assistance administrator, and procurement and disbursement
specialists. The PCU would be assisted by an expatriate procurement adviser during the first two years
of implementation. A "Component Coordinator" (CC) for _-ach component has been selected from
existing staff in each participating agency. The CCs would function as the focal points for all activities
related to the project for their respective components, and would report directly to the Minister or Head
of each agency. Selective strengthening and reorganization of implementing agencies would be included
in project conditionality. A strong project monitoring and evaluation program is being developed with
the help of ongoing preparation technical assistance. In fulfillment of the conditions of negotiations, the
PCU has been established and its Director appointed by Government Decree. Detailed TORs for the
PCU and its staff have been agreed. Candidates for the other PCU positions are being identified.
6.    Project Sustainability. The project aims to reform the existing wasteful and inefficient system
of social protection into one which is sustainable over the longer term. Recurrent administrative cost
implications of project activities are very limited and pose no major threat to financial sustainability. The
establishment of a PCU with coordinating and specialist functions would support and strengthen the line
implementing agencies of the Government.
7.    Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The project would be aimed at building
Government capacity to help alleviate the social costs of adjustment. OED analyses of past World Bank-
supported institutional strengthening operations have revealed mixed results and have emphasized the
importance of the following factors: (i) Government commitment to the project; (ii) clarity of objectives
and procedures; (iii) careful design of staff training programs; and (iv) close supervision by the World
Bank. The Government's commitment to the project's objectives is strong, and a clear understanding of
objectives and Association procedures as well as local "ownership" of the proposed actions have been
developed through grant-financed technical assistance and information seminars during project
preparation. Systematic staff training is included in all project components and has already started in
implementing agencies. Priority will be given to providing sufficient resources for project supervision
which will need to be intensive, particularly during the first year of implementation.
8.    Rationale for Association Involvement.  The project is fully consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy which was presented to the Board in the context of the Rehabilitation Credit in May
1993, and which has among its key objectives to improve the effectiveness cf the social safety net. The

privatization, including the proposed Privatization and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Credit (PESAC) to
be submitted to the Board on June 30, 1994. The Kyrgyz Republic is at the forefront of FSU Republics
in terms of its program for transition to a market economy, but lacks the institutional capacity to carry
out necessary reforms in the social sectors on its own at the pace necessary to support the transition. The
Association is the lead donor agency in the social sectors.
9.    Agreed Actions. During negotiations, agreement was reached that the Government will take
action to strengthen the staffing of implementing agencies and reorganize them as tentatively agreed
during appraisal, including the strengthening of the Department of Employment to 61 positions by
October 31, 1994 and the preparation of a redeployment plan to strengthen social assistance staffing in
MLSP by December 31, 1994. It was also agreed that the redeployment plan, a new consolicated social
assistance benefit, and a new system for targeting will be implemented by June 30, 1995. A policy
statement on training, including provisions to ensure that training is demand-driven and efficient, has been
agreed. The appointment of the agreed staff complement of the PCU is a condition of effectiveness, and
a cross-effectiveness condition has been agreed for the Swiss cofinancing grant.
10.   Environmental Aspects. This is a Category C project.
11.   Program Objective Categories. The proposed project specifically aims to help the poorest end
most vulnerable in the period of transition.  It would also benefit women in particu'ar, sit
disproportionate percentage of the poor and unemployed are women. By facilitating the rem.:.
barriers to labor mobility and reorienting human capital development towards sectors    . prospec.. l e
growth, it would also help remove constraints to private sector development. The project would improve
economic management in the social sectors. It has no identifiable environmental effects (para. 10).
12.   Project Benefits. The main benefits are described in the preceding paragraph 11. These benefits
would be achieved in ways consistent with fiscal realities, and would help maintain popular support for
reform.
13.   Risks. There are two main risks. The first concerns the Govermnent's ability, if a shortfall
occurs in budgetary allocations for social security expenditures, to maintain strict targeting of such
expenditures, including an adequate balance between allocations for social assistance and eventual
supplementary funding of social insurance benefits. This risk will be addressed through annual
consultations over budgetary allocations and through a mid-term review. The second major risk concerns
weak implementation capacity and possible inadequate coordination between implementing agencies and
departments. The project's technical assistance inputs and the reporting relationships and responsibilities
of the Project Coordination Unit have been designed so as to minimize this risk, which would also be
given particular attention by future Association missions.
14.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that Executive Directors approve it.
