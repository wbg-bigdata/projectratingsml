Program Development      The proposed First Programmatic Development Policy Loan (DPL 1) i s the
Objective(s) and         first in a series o f two programmatic Development Policy Loans designed to be
Contribution to CAS      disbursed during fiscal years 20 10 and 20 11.
                         The three main Program Development Objectives are: (i)to manage the
                         impact o f the global crisis by maintaining a sound macroeconomic and fiscal
                         framework; (ii) cushion the impact on the poor and vulnerable by enhancing
                                         to
                         social protection systems; and (iii) strengthen the resilience of the financial
                                                             to
                         sector by addressing potential vulnerabilities. The ultimate objective i s to
                         support the Government to emerge from the crisis on a stronger footing and to
                         resume sustained high growth and convergence in living standards with the
                         rest of Europe.
                         These DPOs will contribute to the following CPS outcomes: (i)     labor market:
                         increasing flexibility of labor market outcomes and decreasing the tax wedge;
                         (ii)health: improve the efficiency and transparency of Health Insurance Fund
                         operations; and (iii) social protection: improve administration and targeting of
                         :ash benefits and strengthen the pension system.


                                                 V
                            The envisaged reform program would also be consistent with the
                            Government's aspiration for eventual membership of the European Union
                            (EU). The proposed operation should have a positive impact on the
                            functioning of the labor market and public administration, which have been
                            identified as critical benchmarks to begin membership negotiations.

Risks and Risk Mitigation   The proposed DPL series has moderate risks. The country went into the
                            financial crisis with a sound fiscal position. Following a fiscal stimulus in late
                            2008 and early 2009, two budget revisions and tightening of monetary policy
                            have been critical in keeping macroeconomic balances at sustainable levels.
                            Specific risks include:
                                0   Uncertainty of global economic outlook. Shocks relating to the
                                    external environment could continue to affect the economy negatively,
                                    e.g. slower than expected recovery in the EU will suppress demand for
                                    exports and capital inflows. The main macroeconomic risk i s that the
                                    balance of payment shortfalls will put renewed pressure on reserves.
                                    The capacity of some public sector institutions to design and
                                    implement ambitious reforms, while much improved over the past few
                                    years, remains relatively weak.
                                    Political risks appear moderate. The government has a stable majority
                                    in all levels of Government and the next elections are a few years
                                    away. However, a dispute over the name of the country could
                                    potentially trigger some political instability. Last year's veto over
                                    NATO membership does not appear to have undermined commitment
                                    to reforms. However, one more veto (this time on the start of
                                    negotiations for EU membership) could trigger a reform fatigue and
                                    remove a big reform anchor.
                            In terms of risk mitigation, economic risks are somewhat mitigated by recent
                            signs o f stabilization. Moreover, the authorities have indicated that they may
                            approach the N F in 2010 should the economy deteriorate. The N F currently
                            broadly endorses the country's fiscal stance which should ease the process of
                            reaching an agreement in case the authorities request it. Going forward,
                            progress towards EU accession should also support capital inflows, and thus
                            the current account; while setbacks to EU membership are a downside risk.

        PROPOSED FIRST PROGRAMMATIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
             TO FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

                                       I.       INTRODUCTION

1.      The ongoing international economic crisis has brought to a halt the acceleration of
economic activity of the last few years in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR
Macedonia). Following growth rates of close to 6 percent in 2007 and the first three quarters of 2008,
economic activity has slowed down considerably since. Industrial production has been declining,
business confidence has reached low levels, financing conditions have become tighter and labor market
performance has deteriorated. Exports have dropped sharply. Negative effects have also spilled over into
the fiscal accounts, and tax revenues in particular have disappointed relative to expectations - although
two budget revisions in May and October 2009 have introduced sharp expenditure cuts, and hence the
fiscal deficit i s still forecast to be a manageable 2.8 percent of GDP.

2.      The authorities have proactively managed the crisis to create grounds for a sustainable and
robust recovery. Anti-crisis measures were announced in late 2008 and early 2009 (see Section 111).
Following an initial fiscal stimulus, the two supplementary budgets adopted in 2009 have not only helped
to contain public spending but also to improve its allocation. Non-priority expenditures were eliminated
while funds for the social safety nets were protected. In addition, comprehensive payroll reform has been
introduced to boost competitiveness o f the economy. Significant improvements to the business
environment were undertaken and measures to strengthen the resilience o f the financial sector are
underway.

3.      Building on this, the proposed First Programmatic Development Policy Loan (DPL1)
supports a program o f government reforms in fiscal management, social protection and the
financial sector. Given the fixed exchange rate regime, fiscal policy has been the main tool for
mitigating the consequences o f the global economic crisis and preserving macroeconomic stability. In
this context, the 2010 budget, which was approved by Government in November 2009, provides further
assurances that fiscal policy will stay supportive of macroeconomic stability. The DPL also supports an
on-going reform program in social protection, to cushion the impact of the crisis on the poor and
vulnerable. Finally, it proposes to support continued financial sector stability, including by strengthening
contingency planning.

4.      The three main Program Development Objectives are:
            a.   to manage the impact o f the global crisis by maintaining a sound macroeconomic and
                 fiscal framework;
            b. to cushion the impact o f the crisis on the poor and vulnerable by enhancing social
               protection systems; and
            c.   to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector by addressing potential vulnerabilities.
5.      The proposed US$30 million First Programmatic Development Policy Loan @PL1) to FYR
Macedonia i s the first in a planned series of two operations. This operation and the follow-on DPL 2
operation are designed to be disbursed during calendar years 2009 and 20 10.
6.       The March 2009 Country Partnership Strategy Progress Report (CPSPR) maintains
flexibility to respond promptly and adequately to the evolving economic situation and includes the
possibility for a DPL to support an endorsable policy response to the global economic crisis.'


                                  11.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

POLITICAL CONTEXT

7.      The political scene has stabilized, although some challenges remain. The early parliamentary
elections in 2008 and the regular 2009 local and presidential elections further concentrated power in the
hands of VMRO-DPMNE and the party (and the new coalition partner DUI, the biggest ethnic Albanian
party) now commands an absolute majority in the Parliament, holds the Presidency of the country and
controls the majority of local governments. The European Commission (EC) recently recommended to its
member states the introduction of a visa-free travel regime for FYR Macedonia and proposed to start
negotiations on full European Union (EU) membership. While progress has been made in meeting the
benchmarks set by the EC as conditions for starting negotiations, Greece may decide to block the start of
negotiations due to a dispute over the name of the country. Pressures to reach a compromise on the name
issue have intensified recently and i t s resolution will open the way for immediate NATO membership
(vetoed by Greece in 2008) as well as potentially faster EU integration.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Pre-crisis

8.      The performance o f the economy improved considerably over the last few years. A laggard
in the region in terms of GDP growth rate until recently, output expanded more vigorously during 2007
and the first three quarters of 2008 bringing the country's growth rate closer to regional averages. Real
GDP growth averaged 6 percent until the final quarter o f 2008, up from around 4 percent in 2003-2006.
Growth benefited from strong external demand and prices for the country's exports, and later on from
strong domestic demand. Investment increased from 20.8 percent of GDP in 2005 to 27.7 percent in
2008, in parallel with improvements in the investment climate. Fees and charges of various agencies
were reduced, procedures eliminated, labor relations overhauled, and reforms in the judiciary and cadastre
strengthened property and creditor rights. At the same time, stronger competition in the banking sector
increased the availability of credit and reduced the cost of finance. Modest employment and real wage
growth as well as better access to credit fueled private consumption.

9.       Fiscal policies were largely supportive of macroeconomic stability and accelerated economic
activity. At around 35 percent of GDP, the size of the budget i s relatively small by regional standards.
Furthermore, tax policy reforms (introduction of a flat tax) further reduced the fiscal burden on economic
activity. Historically, the budget has been largely balanced which contributed to keeping aggregate
demand at manageable levels and avoided crowding out of financing for the private sector. As a result of
the low deficits in recent years, the public debt level i s moderate, amounting to 21.3 percent of GDP in
end-2008. Price stability was largely maintained with inflation picking up somewhat in late 2007 and
early 2008 as a result of the surge in world prices of food and energy.

10.     Relatively slow credit expansion and limited cross-border borrowing further mitigated
economic risks. The role of credit expansion in fueling growth was less pronounced than in other
countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Credit growth intensified much later in FYR Macedonia (around


 (Document No. R2009-0054; IFC/R2009-0050).


                                                      2
2006) and i t s peak (at 44 percent y-0-y in April 2008) was lower than in other countries. In nominal
terms, credit expansion financed by domestic banks was roughly equally distributed between household
and enterprises. More than half o f all loans at the end of 2008 were either extended in foreign currency or
indexed to a foreign currency. Private sector external indebtedness i s also modest, although it almost
doubled in nominal USD terms between 2006 and 2008 reaching around 36 percent of GDP (25 percent if
trade credits are excluded). Most of the increase i s due to long-term loans and mother-daughter firm
transactions related to foreign direct investments (FDI), while exposure to the commercial banking sector
i s limited. According to Bank of International Settlements (BIS) data, foreign banks claims on the FYR
Macedonian non-bank private sector were 4.1 percent o f GDP, one of the lowest in the region.

11.     The current account deficit increased from 1.8 percent in 2005 to 12.5 percent in 2008. This
deterioration reflects the pick-up in import-intensive investments, a terms o f trade shock (oil price
increase) as well as reduced net private transfers (including unrecorded exports of goods and services).
Stronger FDI inflows as well as a draw down in commercial banks' deposits abroad largely financed the
current account deficit. FDI averaged around 6 percent of GDP over 2006-2008, a considerable increase
from the average of 3.7 percent o f GDP in the decade before.

12.    M o r e rapid growth did not improve living conditions for the poor in spite of improvements
in labor market outcomes. Unemployment (measured by the Labor Force Survey) f e l l to 32.0 percent




                                                       3
by the second quarter of 20092. Employment increased faster, but was also accompanied by an increase
in labor force participation which dampened the fall in the unemployment rate. The country's poverty
rates have (so far) not been responsive to the improved performance of the economy; regional experience
suggests that poverty does respond to growth but only with a lag. Poverty rates may also have been
stagnant because jobs were generated in low-paid sectors or for unpaid family work while wage growth
occurred for households already above the poverty line. During 2007-2008, when employment growth
was higher, poverty was also impacted by the surge in world energy and food prices. Characteristics of
the poor include low educational attainment, household size, ethnicity, number o f children,
unemployment (though there are growing numbers of employed poor).

Impact o the crisis
        f

13.     Economic activity has slowed considerably since the final quarter of 2008, though there are
early signs o f stabilization. GDP growth in the last quarter of 2008 declined to 2.0 percent (y-0-y) as
compared to an average growth rate of 6 percent in the previous three quarters. This was followed by a
contraction of 1.2 percent in the first half of 2009; this i s one of the smaller contractions registered in the
region, and i s mostly attributable to a s t i l l relatively healthy financial sector and expansionary fiscal
policy in late 2008 and early 2009. Signs that the crisis i s moderating appeared in the third quarter of the
year, as shown by data on industrial production, electricity consumption, and tax revenues. Output i s
forecast to decline by 1.3 percent in 2009, one of the milder contractions in the region reflecting also the
broadly appropriate economic fundamentals at the onset of the crisis.

14.      The crisis resulted in a collapse in export demand for FYR Macedonian products and
reduced private capital flows. The country's exports are concentrated in a few low value added sectors
(mining, metals and garments) and these saw the demand for and prices of their products plummet.
Furthermore, excessive reliance on net private transfers and more recently FDI to finance domestic
demand has made the country vulnerable to sudden stops in these flows. In the first half of 2009, FDI
levels fell by 60 percent compared to levels during the same period in 2008.

 15.     As in other countries in the region, budget revenues suffered significantly from the
international economic crisis and two supplementary budgets were approved in 2009. Budget
revenues in the first nine months of 2009 were 6.9 percent lower than in the same period the previous
year. Budget expenditures, on the other hand increased' by 11.0 percent, which contributed to the
relatively slow adjustment in domestic demand and a relatively milder GDP contraction. In spring the
first Supplementary Budget was adopted which provided a fiscal adjustment of around 2.5 percent of
GDP, reflecting lower import-intensive capital expenditures and lower goods and services spending and a
freeze on public sector wages and employment. As it became clear that further adjustments were needed,
a second Supplementary Budget was prepared, which was approved by Parliament in October 2009. The
second Supplementary Budget maintains the deficit target of 2.8 percent of GDP, and reduces
expenditures to match the lowered projection for revenues by 3.2 percent (see Box 1). The authorities are
committed to the deficit target and will further adjust expenditures if required. Most of the 2009 deficit i s
being financed by the proceeds of a Euro 175 million Eurobond (see Box 2).

16.      The current account deficit i s projected to fall from 12.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to about
9.4 percent in 2009, due largely to a smaller trade deficit and a recent rebound in private transfers.
Private transfers, the main source of financing the deficit, improved since the second quarter of the year


* It i s widely acknowledged that the reported unemployment rate i s probably overestimated. Alternative measures o f
the unemployment rate (either through using stricter filters in the LFS or using the HBS) suggest that the
unemployment rate i s most likely lower, but still high, at around 25 percent.



                                                            4
as speculations about potential devaluation which triggered conversion from Denar into forex assets
subsided. The current account deficit i s expected to be close to balance in the third quarter o f 2009.

  Box 1: The October Supplementary Budget for 2009

  The second Supplement Budget for 2009 was enacted in October. The Supplementary Budget maintains the
  deficit target of 2.8 percent o f GDP, and reduces expenditures by around 3.2 percent compared to the May
  Budget revision (9.2 percent compared to the original 2009 Budget) to match the lowered projection for
  revenues. Financing for the 2009 deficit was secured as the authorities plan to finance this by running down
  deposits (replenished in July 2009 as a result o f the Eurobond issuance) and domestic debt issuance.

  The revenue assumptions in the Supplementary Budget are ambitious. Still, the risk o f breaching the deficit
  target i s low. Namely, considerable part o f the over-estimation on the revenues side i s on Special Revenue
  Accounts (SRAs) and grants which are largely non-deficit creating items (Le. revenues must be realized in
  order to undertake expenditures). Also, the traditional inability to execute expenditures further mitigates some
  of the risks from the ambitious revenue projections. This i s especially the case for capital expenditures.
  Finally, the commitment of the authorities to the deficit target i s strong; they already cut expenditures twice
  and have announced further cuts if needed to meet the target. The deficit for the first three quarters o f 2009
  was around 1.7 percent o f (annual) GDP and there are no indications that the deficit target for the year will be
  breached.

 17.     The Central Bank has responded to the crisis and a loss of foreign currency reserves in late
2008 and early 2009 by raising interest rates and tightening liquidity and reserve requirements. In
this regard, FYR Macedonia stands out compared to other countries in the region. The country's response
likely reflects factors including the currency peg, low (and until recently declining) reserves, and a
relatively robust banking sector. Official reserves, after reaching a low o f euro 1.2 billion in May 2009
have risen to above euro 1.5 billion as o f late October 2009.

18.       The banking system has weathered the external shocks so far. The quality o f banking
supervision and regulation, as well prudent macroeconomic policies contributed to the stability o f the
banking sector. Nevertheless, at 60 percent o f all loans, the large share o f foreign exchange (FX) or FX-
indexed loans in the portfolios o f banks i s a cause o f concern, and NPLs are increasing. However, the
risks have been tempered somewhat by the banking system's relatively sound liquidity, low external roll-
over needs (claims o f non-resident were only 10.5 percent o f total liabilities excluding capital in June
2009, and mostly long-term) and capital buffers (Capital Adequacy Ratio o f 16 percent in June 2009).
Still, tightening monetary policy and competing demand from the public sector, has resulted in lower
amounts and more expensive credit being available to the private sector. Annual growth o f credit to
private sector fell to 6 percent in September 2009, a considerable slowdown from the 34 percent
registered at end-2008. The Denar lending rate increased to 10.3 percent in September 2009, up from 9.6
percent at the end o f the third quarter o f 20093.

19.      The growth slowdown i s expected to worsen living conditions. The performance o f the labor
market improved over the last few years. Even with output contracting recently, unemployment
(measured by the LFS) fell to 32.0 percent by the second quarter o f 2009. However, most o f the jobs
created were low paid jobs and did not contribute to poverty reduction (see para. 12). With economic
growth projected to contract by 2 percent in 2009 from a 5 percent growth rate in 2008, poverty depth, as
well as the number o f poor i s expected to increase. Slower improvement in labor markets w i l l result in


 The actual increase i s probably higher than what i s suggested by the weighted interest rates reflecting the "flight to
quality" by banks. As they reduce overall credit exposure, banks first cut their lending to more risky clients with
higher interest rates thus having an effect o f lowering the weighted interest rate in the economy.



                                                              5
reduced employment and earnings in a country which already has a lot o f working poor. So far, the
impact appears to be relatively minor but could intensify as employment i s typically a lagging indicator
(administrative and LFS data do not point to a deterioration in labor market performance, while national
accounts data suggest a relative modest contraction in private consumption). Reduced access to credit
because of the global credit crunch i s further impacting consumption. The slow recovery in EU-countries
may also reduce remittances although private transfers appear to have performedwell so far.

20.      FYR Macedonia's most recent IMF supported program expired in August 2008. The
country remains on the regular Article N consultation process with the IMF. The last Article N
consultation took place in October 2009. According to the Letter of Assessment from this round o f
Article IV Consultation accompanying this PD (Annex 3), the economic and financial conditions have
improved in recent months and the risks o f instability have decreased. The country has thus far weathered
the global crisis better than most o f the countries in the region with macroeconomic policies helping to
achieve this outcome. At the same time, risks remain, stemming in particular from the still large current
account deficit and from remaining uncertainties about the health and prospects o f the global economy
and world financial markets. Against this background, policies should remain geared towards reducing
risks: the proposed reduction in the fiscal deficit to 2.5 percent o f GDP for 2010 i s appropriate, monetary
policy should remain cautious while structural reforms need to continue. While the authorities have not
requested an arrangement with the IMF, they have indicated that they keep this option open should the
financial situation deteriorate.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

21.     Under the baseline scenario, growth i s expected to turn positive in 2010, and to gradually
accelerate over the medium-term. In line with the latest IMF projections, the authorities are projecting
a GDP growth o f 2 percent in 2010, accelerating to about 4.5 percent over the medium-term, driven by
both capital accumulation (higher investments) as well as total factor productivity gains due to the
ongoing reforms (including on payroll reform, see section below). This will be accompanied by a gradual
narrowing of the fiscal and external balances. There are early indications that some foreign investments -
delayed as a result of the crisis - will be resumed while the improvements in the business environment,
including lower labor costs, and an eventual start of negotiations with the EU should bolster investor
confidence. Inflation will remain stable and low, anchored by the strong commitment of the authorities to

22.      The general government budget deficit i s expected to decline gradually over the medium-
term to around 1.5-2.0 percent of GDP which should support macroeconomic stability but will still
continue to provide stimulus to the economy. Despite a reduction in direct taxes (payroll reform and
generous corporate income taxation exemptions), total revenues are projected to rebound slightly in 20 10
due to recovering domestic demand. Pressures over revenues as a result of reforms to lower the tax
burden are expected to be off-set over the medium-term, including by larger inflows o f EU pre-accession
funding. Expenditure adjustments are expected on the wage and salaries component as policies to control
employment and wages are extended. The authorities are committed to identify additional savings in non-
priority expenditures, while trying to protect spending on productive expenditures. The fiscal deficit i s
expected to recede to around 2.5 percent o f GDP in 2010 and further down to 2 percent over the medium-
term. Around one quarter of the deficit i s from foreign financed projects, and financing for the remaining
 1.5-1.8 percent will need to be identified. Given the relatively shallow domestic capital market, financing
from this source will be limited over the medium term, and a considerable part of the financing will need
to be secured externally.

23.      The pegged exchange rate regime puts an even greater emphasis on the need for prudent
policies and sustained reforms. While the fixed exchange rate peg i s critical to macroeconomic
stability, i t also constraints government policies and can undermine competitiveness relative to other
countries in the region which have allowed their currencies to depreciate. The authorities are responding
to this by reducing social insurance contributions and taking steps to improve the business environment in
order to reduce costs for businesses. Standard measures do not show significant exchange rate
misalignment, while the reductions in the labor tax wedge and improvements in property rights and in the
overall business climate should enhance competitiveness.

24.     The external balance i s also projected to adjust. Stronger nominal GDP growth combined
with a recovery in exports and private transfers as well a gradual fiscal adjustment i s expected to lower

the current account deficit to around 6 percent o f GDP by 2012. Export growth (nominal) i s projected at
5.6 percent in 2010 accelerating to 9.3 percent by 2012 as exports return to their pre-crisis levels over the
medium term. The projections for the growth rate of exports o f goods and services reflect assumptions of
a gradual recovery in foreign markets (growth in advanced economy o f 0.3 percent in 2010 accelerating
to 1.7 percent by 2012 as projected in latest World Economic Outlook), some improvement in prices as
well as higher exports resulting from the recent FDI inflows. Private transfers are expected to rebound
somewhat in 2010 reflecting largely a low base effect from early 2009. The pick-up in growth in
developed countries in 2010 i s expected to increase private transfers by around 5 percent in 201 1, in line
with forecasts for the region in the latest Migration and Development Brie+. Afterwards, the growth rate
of private transfers i s expected to moderate to around 2-3 percent annually over the medium term.

25.      Gradual improvement is expected on the financing side as well, with foreign direct and
portfolio investments gradually returning to the pre-crisis levels by 2012. The recovery o f FDI in
2010 and 201 1 should be substantial based on a global recovery' of private capital flows and the
resumption o f a number o f delayed investments (including the concession o f the airports, investments in
the free trade zone and some real estate investments). Loosening financial market conditions should also
allow for cheaper and easier access to international capital markets. Credit default spreads have already
declined from the highs registered earlier this year6 and with the recent stabilization and upgrade in the
outlook o f the credit rating (S&P recently reinstated the "stable" outlook for the BB+ credit rating o f the
country, after downgrading it to "negative" earlier this year), the spreads should decline further. The
baseline scenario assumes that the authorities will secure financing by issuing Eurobonds, however, the
authorities have also indicated that they could enter into an arrangement with the IMF. Reserves are
largely expected to remain stable over the medium-term in terms of coverage of imports, while increasing
in absolute amounts. In the outer years, privatization could further bolster reserves and reduce state
involvement in the economy.

26.    Still, considerable risks remain and the authorities need to remain committed to prudent
macroeconomic policies. Slower recovery o f exports (sluggish growth in main trading partners andor
low metal prices) and capital flows (FDI and portfolio investments) could renew pressures on the pegged
exchange rate. At the same time, affordable external financing may not be available. Under such a
scenario, macroeconomic policies will have to be adjusted with a greater focus given on stabilization
rather than countercyclical policies. Monetary policy will need to remain tight and the authorities are
committed to larger fiscal consolidation (most likely further expenditure restructuring) if needed in order
to reduce aggregate demand. Under this scenario, the external adjustment will be faster, though at a
higher cost to growth. An IMF-arrangementwill be one o f the few alternatives to avoid an unnecessarily


  According to the Institute for International Finance, net Direct Investments in Europe in 2010 are expected to
increase by 48 percent compared to 2009.
  As o f early-November 2009, the credit default spread o f the 2005 Eurobond issue over a corresponding Bundes
Bond was 520 bps (compared to 1,152 bps in December 2008); the spread for the 2009 Eurobond issue was 529 bps
(compared to 749 bps in July 2009).

sharp economic adjustment and as outlined in the IMF's Letter o f Assessment, the authorities have
signaled that they are prepared to request IMF support if needed in the future.

27.     Under the baseline scenario of gradual recovery, public and external debt remain
sustainable. Despite some narrowing o f the current account deficit in 2009, external debt i s projected to
increase to around 55 percent of GDP as non-debt creating flows remain suppressed (FDI and portfolio
investments). External debt i s envisaged to increase further to 56 percent of GDP in 2010 before
resuming a declining path. At the same time, fiscal deficits over the medium-term will increase general
government debt to slightly below 27 percent o f GDP by 2012, a relatively moderate (to low) level
compared internationally. Though solvency indicators on public and external debt do not point to
significant risk o f unsustainable debt under the base case scenario, liquidity indicators give reason for
policymakers to be cautious.

28.     However, debt sustainability can potentially be tested if some of the assumptions of the base
case scenario do not materialize. Public debt remains sustainable under the standard alternative
scenarios imposed in sustainability analysis (key variables at historic levels and no policy change
scenario), and it appears resilient to the shocks imposed. Public debt becomes unsustainable if growth
remains sluggish or if there i s a larger fiscal expansion over the medium term. Additional budget
financing and further adjustment measures would be needed under this scenario. Similar conclusions
apply to external debt sustainability. Moreover, swings in unexplained private transfers or volatility in
non-debt creating inflows may impact the sustainability of external balances.

29.      Despite the considerable uncertainty, the macroeconomic environment i s considered
adequate for the purposes of the proposed Development Policy Loan. The set o f macroeconomic
policies implemented prior to the global crisis and during the last year has helped limit the GDP decline in
2009. Going forward, the announced policies appear to be supportive o f gradual recovery o f economic
activity and narrowing of the external and fiscal imbalances. Still, policy-makers need to remain vigilant
and adequate measures need to be undertaken in case o f a slower than expected recovery.



       111.   THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

30.      The overarching goal of the country i s EU integration, improved economic performance
and reduction o f unemployment and poverty. While FYR Macedonia does not have a single national
development strategy statement, key documents include the Stabilization and Association Agreement with
the EU and Accession Partnership with the EU, as well as the closely-linked National Plan on Adoption
o f the Acquis and the Pre-accession Economic Program (serving a macro-fiscal strategic document) and
other sector strategies. The Ohrid Framework Agreement, which concluded the six months o f hostilities
in 2001, regulates the relationship with minority communities in the country.

3 1.    The current Government was elected on the basis o f an ambitious economic reform agenda
in July 2006. The government i s led by VMRO-DPMNE (Democratic Party for Macedonian National
Unity). After the early Parliamentary elections in 2008, which saw further strengthening o f the positions
of VMRO-DPMNE, the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), the largest party o f ethnic-Albanians
replaced the smaller Democratic Party o f Albanians (DPA) as a coalition partner in the Government. The
new Government has absolute as well as the so-called "Badinter" majority (some regulations require that
majority o f representatives of ethnic communities support it in addition to the regular majority). At the
local and presidential elections held in 2009, VMRO-DPMNE also won most o f the mayoral positions at
the local level, while their candidate was elected into the presidential position. The Government's
program i s based on an election manifesto entitled "Rebirth in 100 Steps".

 Box 2: Government Measures to Mitigate the Impact of the Crisis

 First set of measures (late 2008):
  1. Moratorium on liabilities towards the HIF and their elimination after 4 years in case firms regularly service
 current liabilities;
 2. Cancelation of penalty interest on late liabilities based on non-payment o f personal income tax, corporate
 income tax, VAT, property tax and pension contribution if firms pay the original outstanding amount;
 3. Re-programming o f tax liabilities;
 4. Continuationo f the suspension o f the provisions of the Law on Payments which would have closed all firms
 with blocked accounts;
 5. Conversion of Government claims on 4 large loss-makers into equity;
 6. Amendments to the Corporate Income Tax allowing profit tax exemption for all profits not allocated to
 dividends;
 7. Reduction in customs duties;
 8. Continuation of the non-taxationo f interest income on time deposits;
 9. Lowering the tax burden for farmers;
  10. Reduction of "representation expenses" of budget users.

 Second set o f measures (early 2009):
 Prior to elections, the government announced a massive multi-year infrastructure program estimated to be
 worth around EUR 8 billion, or 120 percent of GDP to be implemented over a 7 year period. The program
 includes major rehabilitation of the road and energy infrastructure in the country and i s expected to mitigate
 the consequences o f the crisis as well as improve the overall competitiveness o f the economy. The program
 has been described as over-ambitious, and implementationwill be at best delayed.

 Third set of measures (May 2009):
 1. I n May, 2009, the government adopted a first Supplementary Budget keeping the 2.8 percent of GDP deficit
 but based on a revised macroeconomic framework.
 2. EUR 100 million loan from the EIB to support access to finance for SMEs.
 3. Set of 50 measures for trade facilitation.

 Fourth set o f measures (October 2009):
 1. Adoption of a second Supplementary Budget (see Box 1)


32.      Given the weakening external environment, anti-crisis plans were announced in late 2008
and early 2009 and two supplementary budgets were adopted in 2009. The anti-crisis plans (see Box
2 ) largely benefited firms facing liquidity problems due to liabilities towards the public sector, but also
included some trade facilitation measures and additional tax exemptions. The first Supplementary Budget
included employment freezes (with the exception o f employment on the grounds o f the Ohrid Framework
Agreement), postponement o f wage increases as well as cuts in current and capital spending, totaling
around 2.5 percent o f GDP. The second revision to the 2009 Budget projects a 2.8 percent o f GDP deficit
based on more realistic projections for economic developments and if carefully managed should be
consistent with medium-term sustainability o f fiscal accounts.

33.      The authorities also remain committed to reforms that create grounds for a sustainable and
robust recovery including through a strong focus on improving the investment climate. A better
business environment w i l l reduce costs and improve competitiveness o f businesses. Also, the global
crisis represents an opportunity to attract investors as investors may be in search o f lower cost
opportunities once the recovery materializes. At the same time, the authorities appear committed to
investments to improve the stock o f human and physical capital.

34.      The improvements in the business environment over the last few years have improved the
country's ranking on the Ease of Doing Business Indicator from 92 in 2006 to 32 in 2009. FYR
Macedonia now ranks among the top ten countries on the Starting a Business indicator. Over the last few
years, the authorities embarked upon a comprehensive reform o f tax policy and administration.
According to the BEEPS 2008, labor i s a considerably smaller obstacle to doing business compared to
2005 - linked to the 2005 Labor Law and i t s 2008 amendments. Efforts were also undertaken to promote
competition in a number o f sectors (banking, telecommunications etc.) and to strengthen property,
creditor and contract rights (reforms in the judiciary, cadastre etc.). However, further efforts are needed,
including to ensure the implementation o f recently adopted legislation. Continuing the reform o f social
security contributions i s also particularly important in helping to maintain wage competitiveness,
especially given FYR Macedonia's fixed exchange rate.

35.      As discussed in further detail below, the government's reform program focuses on three areas:

             a. to manage the impact of the global crisis by maintaining a sound macroeconomic and
                fiscal framework;
             b. to cushion the impact on the poor and vulnerable by enhancing social protection systems;
                and
             c. to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector by addressing potential vulnerabilities.

PUBLIC SECTOR EXPENDITURE REFORMS

36.     The government sector in FYR Macedonia i s not excessively large. Central Government
revenues averaged around 34 percent o f GDP over the 2006-2008 period, placing FYR Macedonia among
the ECA countries with moderate government size. Fiscal revenues had been on a declining trend up to
2006, when a comprehensive tax policy and administration reform was launched resulting in considerable
improvement in tax collection and an increase in government revenues as a percent o f GDP. The overall
tax burden i s similar to Romania and Slovakia, with only Albania having considerably lower government
revenues a a percent of GDP. Compared internationally, government expenditures are s t i l l slightly
          s
below the median for central and east European countries.

37.     The planning and budgeting process has been strengthened in recent years with revisions to
the Budget Law in 2005,2007 and 2008. Key features o f the budget management framework in FYR
Macedonia are summarized in Box 3. While the legislation adopted i s generally in line with good
international practice, implementation could be improved further.

38.      However, the structure o f spending i s unfavorable with wages and other current spending
dominating. Although the fiscal accounts suggest declining wages and salaries as a percent o f GDP
during the last few years, this excludes a considerable part o f the government wage bill'. A broader (and
more realistic) definition of the wage bill would probably reach about 10 percent o f GDP, which i s large
(although not as large as in some other countries in the region). Pensions are the second largest spending
category accounting for around 8-9 percent of GDP, while at around 2 percent o f GDP the remaining
social transfers are not excessive. Government capital expenditures averaged around 4 percent of GDP
over 2006-2008, slightly higher compared to the earlier period but still below pre-crisis levels in most
countries in the region.

'The second phase o f decentralization transferred responsibility for payment o f wages in some sectors (primary and
secondary education, culture, social protection etc.) to the municipal level and these are now captured under
transfers in the Central Government accounts. The health sector wage bill i s also classified under transfers. Finally,
government agencies widely use consultancy contracts (captured under goods and services) to avoid relatively rigid
conditions for new employment.

39.      The 2008 Public Expenditure Review noted the scope to improve the efficiency of public
spending in a number of sectors. While there has been progress in tackling inefficiencies in some
sectors, considerable inefficiencies remain and some new measures introduce further limitations to policy
effectiveness. The two 10 percent across-the-board increases in public sector wages in late 2007 and late
2008; the more generous indexation o f pensions; the Personal Computer for every student program; and
the additional support to former employees o f "bankrupt" companies are examples of policies which are
likely to have fiscal implications and restrict flexibility o f government expenditures over the medium and
long-term.

Overall fiscal framework and the composition of spending

40.     The onset of the global crisis necessitated a shift in spending patterns in FYR Macedonia. I t
required an adjustment to the fiscal framework to preserve fiscal and external sustainability. In terms o f
composition, the adjustment needed to be directed towards eliminating non-priority spending while
protecting expenditures that help mitigate the impact of the crisis on the most vulnerable groups, as well
as expenditures that provide most stimulus to the economy.

4 1.    The two Supplementary Budgets adopted in 2009 proposed a number of improvements in
public spending. In spring the first Supplementary Budget was adopted which provided a fiscal
adjustment of around 2.5 percent o f GDP, reflecting lower import-intensive capital expenditures and
lower goods and service spending, and a freeze on public sector wages and employment. The second
Supplementary Budget further reduces non-priority and high-import content expenditures, while at the
same time maintaining the allocation for the well performing social transfers. Wage and salaries and
goods and services were cut to a level that should still ensure normal functioning o f the public
administration and non-accumulation of arrears. There were further expenditure cuts on capital
expenditures, reflecting the elimination o f a number o f less productive capital investments.

 Box 3: Key Features of Public Financial Management Practices in FYR Macedonia

 1.     The fiscal framework i s defined as part o f a medium-term macroeconomic and public debt framework;
 2.     Strategic priorities are included in the medium term budget plans required for budget users;
 3.     An explicit annual budget calendar with key dates i s specified in the Budget Law;
 4.     The Budget Circular sets three year budget ceilings for each budget user;
 5.     The multi-year development projects planning process i s incorporated into the budget process and
        harmonized with strategic plans and general budget preparation requirements;
 6.     Budget plans are specified in terms o f programs and sub-programs for each budget user and performance
        indicators are required for each ministry's programs;
 7.     Explicit limits are in place on in-year virement within appropriations, including maximum adjustments
        for salaries, rents and allowances, and there i s Parliamentary control over virement between budget users;
 8.     A Centralized Treasury Single Account and centralized payment control i s in place;
 9.     Mandatory quarterly financial plans are prepared by budget users on the utilization o f appropriated
        budgets and they are submitted to the treasury. Budget users also submit monthly financial plans, by
        budget classification, to the Treasury for approval before the beginning o f each quarter;
  10.   Financial commitments are registered in advance o f payment through a central commitments ledger;
  11.   Monthly financial reports on budget execution are published on the Ministry o f Finance website and
        Semi-annual reports on budget execution are also published;
  12.   Final accounts are submitted to the Assembly within six months o f the end o f the financial year and
        independently audited by the State Audit Office.
 Despite this relatively elaborate framework for PFM, there are still some weaknesses in the budget process.
 Some o f the features outlined above are still evolving. Namely, while expenditure controls are rather sound,
 budget preparation could further improve and monitoring and evaluation also need to be strengthened.
 Furthermore, PFM capacity and practices also vary considerably among various parts o f the Government.
 Strengthened governance and transparency has been a major source o f improved PFM practices in the HIF.
 Similar reforms, focusing on improved governance and disclosure arrangements were introduced in other key
 agencies (Customs, PRO, Cadastre) resulting in improved performance. There are early signs that the reforms
 in the judiciary (promoting greater accountability and transparency) are also beginning to show results.
 However, a number o f public sector agencies still remain unreformed and accountability mechanisms need to
 be strengthened. Recent reforms in this area include the introduction o f the "silence i s consent" principle in
 the public administration; the implementation o f the Law on free access to information as well as the broader
 regulatory reform.
 Reform efforts in Public Financial Management have strong ownership by the Government and have been
 actively supported by the Donor community. The Budget reform process was initially supported by the World
 Bank, through the PSMAC and PSMAL, and later on by USAID. The Bank also took the lead on reforms in
 the health sector, internal and external audit, leveraging assistance from the Dutch Government. The IMF has
 taken the lead on reforms in the Public Revenue Office. With the EU policies on procurement being relatively
 extensive, the initial World Bank lead on public procurement issues has been recently taken over by the EU.
 UNDP and USAID have provided support for improved PFM arrangements at the local level.


42.     The 2010 Budget entails a further change in the structure of expenditures. The 2010 Budget
was adopted by Government on November 5, 2009 and envisages a fiscal deficit o f 2.5 percent o f GDP.
Wage spending i s expected to decline a a result o f the government intention to freeze (net) wages and
                                        s
employment in the public sector. Spending on goods and services i s also going to be controlled by further
reducing non-priority spending. Social spending i s expected to increase slightly to reflect indexation o f
pensions, higher transition costs o f the pension system and increased spending for the vulnerable.
Subsidies and transfers are expected to increase mostly due to higher subsidies in the agriculture sector
and greater support to businesses. Capital expenditures are projected to increase significantly, to an
ambitious 5.4 percent o f GDP in 2010. Financing o f the 2010 Budget i s largely planned to come from
foreign sources.




                                                              14
Public Wage Bill

43.      Control over the wage bill has reemerged as a priority of the government. The Government
adjourned the planned 10 percent increase in public sector salaries for 2009 (the third and last increase in
a 3-year plan to increase wages by 10 percent annually). Moreover, all new employment has been frozen
with the exception of new employments on the grounds o f the Ohrid Framework Agreement. In 20 10, the
authorities plan to use the planned reduction in social contribution rates due to the payroll reform (see
discussion below) to reduce outlays on wages and salaries by reducing the gross wage in the public sector
(rather than allowing for net wage increases). These measures, while expedient in the light of the fiscal
crisis, are not sustainable in the medium-term. A long term freeze on salaries will make it difficult to
attract and retain competent staff. Hiring freezes, by the same token, run the risk o f generating skill gaps,
as key staff retire and are not replaced.

44.     Renewed efforts in public administration reform would be supported by the proposed
DPL2. The Central Government maintains relatively strict controls over employment by requiring MOF
approval o f all new employments. Financial controls exercised by Central level institutions also appear
effective in containing employment at other levels of government. The implementation of the Civil
Servants Law, including the decompression efforts, represents further progress. However, more remains
to be done, including extending the system to the rest of the public administration. The authorities
recently established an Inter-ministerial Committee on Public Administration reforms chaired by the
Prime Minister which should lead the efforts in this area. Some o f the priorities of this body will include
regulating the status o f employees across the entire public administration as well as their remuneration.
This would help to ensure that the system o f pay i s transparent and promotes accountability, and that
salary levels are comparable to and competitive with those in the wider labor market. In addition to
modernizing pay policy and preparing a new Public Sector Wages Law, further efforts are also needed to
improve the quality o f data about pay and jobs for public administration employees outside the central
government.

Reforming payroll taxes in a fiscally sustainable manner

Reducing social contributions

45.      Crisis management in FYR Macedonia has taken place against the background o f an
ambitious payroll reform, which was started in 2009. Like in other parts of former Yugoslavia, overall
labor taxation remains high because o f the social contributions, which until recently were as high as 32.5
percent of gross wages for the average wage earner. The labor tax wedge i s especially high for low-wage
labor, largely because o f the minimum social contribution and therefore has important distributional
impacts, in addition to offering a disincentive for formal employment (especially of low-wage labor).

46.      A major pillar o f the reforms i s the gradual reduction o f Social Insurance Contributions
rates (SICs) until 2011. As of January, 2009, the total SICs were reduced from 32.5 percent of the gross
salary to 28.4 percent. Going ahead, in 2010, the SIC will be further reduced to 27 percent of the gross
salary. At the end of the reform, the SICs will be 22.5 percent in 201 1, however, the exact schedule of
reduction may be adjusted to reflect the expectations for the fiscal outcomes in 2010 and 201 1,
Additional elements of the reforms included reducing the tax wedge for lower-wage workers, broadening
the tax base by including fringe benefits, harmonizing income bases for social security, and moving from
a net wage to a gross wage basis for calculating contributions. These reforms should have positive effects
on the labor market in general, and for unskilled and young workers, in particular. However, the across-
the-board cut in social contributions by 10 percentage points over the next three years raises the issue of
the fiscal costs of these measures.

47.     The payroll reform will be critical in laying the conditions for a more sustainable recovery
in FYR Macedonia over the medium term, but it also raises particular challenges to the
sustainability of the pensions and health systems. The on-going cuts in social contribution rates are
reducing the labor tax wedge and streamlining wage contracting and payment, and are thus an important
instrument for improving wage competitiveness, especially given FYR Macedonia's fixed exchange rate
regime. At the same time, the reform will put pressure on revenues over the medium term, increasingthe
urgency of further measures to improve the efficiency of spending. This i s particularly the case for the
health and pensions sectors, which are affected mostly directly by the reductions in contributions, and are
thus the focus of attention in the dialogue.

48.     I n the context of the payroll reform, a number of further measures to strengthen the fiscal
position are being introduced. For instance, as part of the payroll reforms, the definition of wage was
expanded to include some important fringe benefits paid to employees (i.e. the food and transport
allowances). With pensions partially indexed to wages, amendments to the Pension and Disability
Insurance Law have been adopted earlier in 2009 to temporarily reduce the indexation coefficients in
order to limit the fiscal impact of the recently introduced expansion of the wage definition'. As a result,
pension expenditures will increase by less than 5 percent in 2009, compared to an increase of around 12.5
percent had the amendments not been adopted.

49.      Efforts to increase the contribution base can help to offset the negative fiscal impact of the
payroll reforms. One important distortion has been caused by the provision of free health insurance by
the Employment Agency to those registering as unemployed (with relatively limited checks on the
accuracy of the information provided). As a result, people working informally or being inactive
registered as unemployed, thus inflating the number of unemployed. According to the Employment
Agency, around 68,000 of the 34 1,000 registered unemployed in July 2009 were registering only for the
purpose of receiving free health insurance. The recently adopted amendments to the Health Insurance
Law moved the responsibility for the provision of free health insurance from the Employment Agency to
the Health Insurance Fund. While there i s no requirement to be registered as unemployed any more,
anyone who applies for free health insurance but i s not registered as unemployed needs to submit a

  Net reported wages increased by around 20 percent on in the first half o f 2009 compared to the second half o f
2008, most o f which (around 70 percent) due to the inclusion o f transport and meal allowances as wages. The
"corrected" wage increase over this period was probably around 3 percent. Using the officially reported wage
statistics in the indexation formula would have meant a significant additional increase in pensions. Namely, pension
indexation in Macedonia takes place twice a year and takes into account wages and inflation with equal weights
50:50 (this decision was introduced in 2008 replacing the 80:20 CPI: wages indexation). The 50 percent weight
                                                                                                 n
given to wages would have resulted in a pension increase o f around 10 percent, compared to a increase o f around
 1.5 percent in case the "genuine" wage increase was used.

link the provision of free health insurance from the employment status and to introduce a means threshold
above which individuals will be required to pay contributions for health insurance.

                                f
Reaffirming the sustainability o the pension system

50.     Pensions provide subsistence to a large part o f the population and are an important buffer
against poverty. Around 273,000 persons receive pensions from the Pension and Disability Insurance
Fund at a total cost o f around 8 percent o f GDP in 2008. After increasing fast in the 1990's (due to low
retirement age and early retirement schemes), this number has stabilized over the last decade. The
average pension in 2008 was 9,541 MKD, translating into a replacement rate o f around 55 percent. The
replacement rate had been on a declining trend until 2007, however, a change in the indexation and an
additional ad-hoc increase in pensions resulted in some reversal in 2008, setting a replacement rate to the
level above the one the system can afford.

5 1.     The country has come a long way in reforming its pension system. A number o f parametric
reforms to the PAYGO system, a defined benefit system typical for most economies in ECA, were
introduced over the last 15 years to restore its sustainability endangered by the deteriorating performance
o f the economy and labor markets and the generous entitlements provided under the previous system.
These measures included the increase in the retirement age and contribution rates as well as reduction of
the replacement rate. Further, a mandatory defined contribution component was added to the system with
the introduction of the second pension pillar (private) on January 1, 2006, and the voluntary defined
contribution component in 2009.

52.    The sustainability o f the pensions system needs to be reconfirmed in light of the on-going
payroll reform'. The 2008 PER extensively analyzed the long-term sustainability of the pension system
and concluded that the system i s largely sustainable even under relatively conservative assumptions about
GDP and employment growth. However, some measures undertaken recently could potentially test the
affordability o f the system. These measures include more generous indexation of pensions (replaced the
80:20 Consumer Price Index (CP1)-wages indexation with 50:50); ad-hoc increases o f pensions (in


  I n addition, a considerable part o f the population i s excluded from the system. The high unemployment rate and the
large informal sector have resulted in relatively low coverage o f the pension system. As a result, over the medium-
to long run, a growing number of citizens will not meet the minimum requirements for receiving a pension. The
authorities still have to define a long-term strategy to deal with these issues.



                                                             17
addition to the increase mandated by the indexation formula) as well as gradual reduction in pension
contribution rates without a corresponding reduction in the replacement rate.

53.      The authorities are devising a long-term strategy to ensure sustainability of the system.
Depending on the outcome of the update of the actuarial analysis and the analysis of the impact of the
planned reduction of contribution rates (to be supported by DPLl), the authorities will introduce
additional measures to safeguard the system. These measures could involve a retirement age increase,
further changes in indexation o f pension benefits, changes in the PAYG pension formula and adjustments
o f the mandatory pension system contribution rates. The Bank will support these measures within the
framework of the DPL 2.

Improving the sustainability o the health sector
                             f

54.      A strong reform effort over the last few years focusing on the performance o f the Health
Insurance Fund has considerably improved the sustainability o f the sector. The Health Insurance
Law was amended to streamline the operations, decision-making and transparency o f the Board of
Directors of the HIF. The competitive procurement of pharmaceuticals (an important achievement of a
previous DPL series) resulted in considerable savings. Most recently, the HIF board has decided to
institute reference pricing" and stronger controls over spending were institutionalized.

55.         The financial results of the public health sector have improved. The financial obligations of
the HIF towards suppliers were cleared by 2007, while the obligations of the entire public health sector
f e l l from 1.7 percent of GDP (4.7 percent of government revenues) in 2004 to 0.4 percent of GDP (1.0
percent of government revenues) in 2008. The preparation for launching bundled pricing for acute
inpatient services based on Diagnostic Related Groups (or DRGs) i s well advanced and will hrther
rationalize capacity in the hospital sector. However, in order for hospitals to be prepared to function
under output-based financing, financial management and service delivery arrangements (level of
autonomy over budget, hiring and firing), and capacity must be enhanced. For example, currently, the
majority of HCIs have very high fixed costs (over 80 percent for salaries) which leave little for
purchasing other inputs for service delivery. More balanced budget allocations will require capacity
rationalization, especially on human resources and use of more contracted staff.

56.     Still, the long-term sustainability o f the system needs to be further strengthened, as the
labor market impact o f the crisis and the announced contribution reforms reduce available health
sector financing, with a potentially significant impact on the poor. Combined public and private
health spending in FYR Macedonia in 2008 i s around 6.5 percent of GDP, down from close to 9 percent
in 2004. Access and quality of services are an issue. Public opinion polls consistently rate health services
as "poor or very poor" while household budget surveys show that out-of-pocket payments for health care
are significant and pose financial access barriers for poor households.

57.     I n the short term, a well functioning treasury function within the Health Insurance Fund
(IF) significantly enhance financial management and control in the health sector. I t provides a
       can
second line of defense against budget over-commitment or spending by the HIF and the HCIs. Because a
treasury system records every transaction in the health care system, it enables a complete set of
management reports on all aspects of budget execution to be prepared on a regular or ad hoc basis. It
captures all commitments and payables, assisting HCIs in better managing their own budgets throughout
the year. It also can supply reports on an economic, organizational or functional basis. Finally, it would


loRather than procuring drugs, under reference pricing the HIF would reimburse a fixed amount covering the cost o f
a generic drug. Doctors and patients could choose which drug to use.



                                                           18
enable future streamlining o f the financial processes in the health sector and improve efficiency and
combat against the problem o f arrears build-up for HCIs.

58.     A Treasury function in the HIF, rather than the Ministry o f Finance (MoF) allows for
health-sector specific procedures and policies. Financing o f provision o f health services i s evolving
away from input-based financing o f health services towards output-based financing. The recent
introduction o f DRGs i s a step in this direction. Under such contract arrangements, control mechanisms
need to be flexible enough to allow public HCIs autonomy in the allocation o f resources. The Treasury
only acts a mechanism for ex-ante controls and ensuring that HCIs do not exceed the allocations and not a
mechanism to control how HCIs spend their money.

59.      While in the short-run some gains can be achieved through improved financial management
(Le. the Treasury function), over the medium-term, the reform of the Basic Benefit Package will be
a critical factor in achieving sustainability of health spending; and will also have an important
impact on access to basic health services for the poor. Currently, the benefits package in the country
provides 90 percent o f the population enrolled in the HIF with comprehensive coverage for outpatient and
inpatient health services. In contrast to the EU countries, non-medical benefits including sick leave and
maternity benefits are also included in the healthcare package. However, the package i s not evaluated
using cost-effectiveness and allocative efficiency criteria and there i s a weak link between annually
available resources for the health sector and the benefits package. While the list o f services being covered
by the health insurance scheme may be reduced, it should be able to guarantee easy and affordable access
t o these goods and services. In addition, there i s an overlap and duplication o f benefits. There i s a need
for division o f typically public health and preventive services, at one hand, traditionally funded by general
revenues and covering entire population, from the curative health services funded by compulsory health
insurance and provided to eligible individuals in need o f health care. In addition to the coverage under
the compulsory health insurance, certain categories o f citizens (children, students, pregnant women,
persons suffering from renal failure, diabetes, cancer, cardiac diseases, etc.) are exempt from co-payment
for those services on categorical or diagnosis basis instead o f their l o w income status, as required by the
existent L a w on Health Insurance.

60.      The reforms of the basic benefits package will be an opportune moment to tackle a number
of long-standing issues in the country. Namely, the lack o f a relationship between available health
sector financing and the BBP, the accountability o f the Health Insurance Fund and Health Care
Institutions for delivering the B B P and opportunities for voluntary health insurance (VHI) covering
services outside the BBP.

STRENGTHENING SOCIAL SAFETY N E T S

61.      A well functioning social safety net that provides a targeted policy response can
substantially reduce the depth, length and impact of economic shocks, such as the current
international crisis. However, this requires sufficient resources, both financial (fiscal resources) and
institutional (existence o f country system to channel the resources to the ones needing them most). The
Government program tries to strengthen the social safety net along these lines.

62.     FYR Macedonia has a complex social safety net system that provides various types of
support to a large part of the country's population. Currently, the country has 10 social protection
programs (income-support and disability benefits) and three child protection programs. All together, the
Budget spent around MKD 4 billion, or 1 percent o f GDP on the 'various programs social and child
protection programs in 2008, considerably lower than the ECA average o f 1.7 percent o f GDP and the
OECD average o f 2.5 percent o f GDP. The remaining 1.1 percent o f G D P refers to social insurance
payments (assistance to the unemployed).Means (or income) testing i s applied only to some programs.


                                                        19
The social and child protection programs include income support programs, child allowances and
disability benefits. While some o f the largest programs are means-tested, the rest of the social and child
protection programs are categorical (i.e. rights-based). Furthermore, it appears that proper means testing
i s only carried out for the largest program, the social financial assistance.

63.       The safety net performs reasonably well, but still suffers from both leakage and exclusion.
Repeated assessments indicate that, while the bulk o f social protection expenditures do end up with the
poorest households, a considerable part o f the assistance i s leaked, i.e. ends up in the population in richer
quintiles. While the country i s among the top five performers in the region in terms o f targeting accuracy
o f total social assistance, still around 30 percent o f social assistance benefits ended up in the households
in the highest three quintiles, with 7.6 percent going to households in the top quintile. While part o f this
i s due to the design o f the programs (categorical rather than means tested), there i s evidence o f failure o f
the means testing mechanisms to properly screen out ineligible households or individuals. At the same
time, only slightly less than half o f all households in the poorest quintile receive social benefits
suggesting relatively large exclusion from the system. As would be expected, the pro-poor effect of child
benefits and other benefits i s much smaller.

64.     Despite decent overall coverage and targeting accuracy, the social safety net faces several
challenges. There are excessive number of benefits that are inconsistent in their definitions and
parameters resulting in funds being dispersed to a number o f small programs which increases
administration costs and limits their effectiveness. In addition, the programs are not consolidated (most
are rights-based and are not taking into account if the recipient benefits from some other program).
Program administration i s fragmented with the Ministry o f Labor and Social Policy and i t s implementing
agencies lacking sometimes the basic information systems to efficiently manage the programs. The



                                                            20
SWCs and the Employment Agency are overburdened with administrative procedures and have limited
capacity to respond to the real needs of their clients.

65.      Social assistance transfers have been protected from the fiscal spending cuts necessitated by
the crisis. Despite cutting expenditures by 6 percent with the May 2009 Supplementary Budget and a
further 3 percent with the second revision, the budgetary allocation for social protection transfers has been
preserved at MKD 2.9 billion. As a result, government spending on social financial assistance increased
from 1.8 percent o f Core Central Budget spending in the original 2009 Budget, to 2.0 percent in the
second Supplementary Budget. Over the January-August period, allocated funds are being executed as
budgeted.

66.      Medium-term improvements o f the functioning of the social protection systems are
embedded in amendments to the Law on Social Protection approved by Parliament in June 2009.
The adopted amendments streamline the procedures regulating social protection system, open up the
option for potential harmonization in the future and allow for a rapid response of the system to emerging
crisis..

67.     An important next step will be to prepare and adopt the by-laws needed for effective
implementation o f the recent amendments (including the critical one on comprehensive definition o f
countable income for social assistance purposes). Going ahead, the authorities should utilize the
information from the unique registry to analyze the social cash benefit system and lay the groundwork for
possible harmonization o f the cash benefit system.

68.      Going forward, the system can be improved to better monitor the programs through
relevant social protection indicators and to track the demand for social assistance. A Unique
Registry o f Social Cash Beneficiaries, currently being developed, will serve this function. The
establishment o f the unique registry should allow for a detailed analysis of the existing cash benefits and
the preparation of a comprehensive Strategy for future development o f the social cash benefit system. The
Strategy, recommending the options for the possible harmonizationof the CB system, will be based on
the data from the unified registry and the review o f all benefits (including non-means tested ones).

 69.     There are plans to develop an energy poverty program to mitigate the impact of the
 planned electricity price reforms on the poor. By ratifying the Athens Energy Treaty the country
joined the Energy Community and committed to gradual liberalization o f the electricity markets. The
 Treaty calls for the establishment o f energy market models based on competition in generation and supply
that would ensure cost-recovery and a reasonable rate o f return for energy market participants. This
transition will result in higher prices for consumers. Given the significant poverty impact such a move
 could have, the authorities have been exploring the option of introducing an energy poverty program or
 adjusting the existing cash benefit system to ensure protection against increased household costs of
 energy. A well targeted program has a considerable poverty reduction impact but also equally important
 it should improve collection and financial situation in the system. Considerable background work has
 already been undertaken under the leadership of the Ministry o f Economy and with technical assistance
 financed by the EBRD. The process i s currently at a stage when critical decisions need to be made about
the design and implementation o f the program. This dialogue will be supported in the context o f DPL2.

70.     The authorities are introducing Conditional Cash transfers (CCTs). CCTs can considerably
affect human capital and reduce inter-generational transmission o f poverty by directly linking social
safety net programs to incentives for investing in human capital development. The introduction of CCT
will be initially piloted to the education sector and will focus on ensuring full compliance with the
recently introduced mandatory secondary education. The DPL will support the Government's reforms
critical to the successful implementation o f the CCT, including the strengthening o f the capacity o f the


                                                       21
Social Works Centers as well as the institutional infrastructure (management information system) needed
to implement CCT.

PRESERVINGFINANCIAL SECTOR STABILITY

71,       The banking system entered the period of the global crisis in a relatively healthy state. This
i s in part due to the prudent regulation and supervision in the recent past as well as central bank's earlier
move to increase prudential requirements". While considered prudent, the supervision has only recently
moved towards risk-basedsupervision which i s s t i l l developing. The capital adequacy ratio for the sector
has been declining in recent years (from 21.3 percent at end-2005 to 16.4 percent at the end of June
2009), mostly due to fast credit growth and weaker origination practices, but it i s s t i l l comfortable on
aggregate and liquidity across the sector i s relatively high. Other financial soundness indicators do not
point to major concerns, despite the current financial crisis.

72.      Even though fundamentals appear appropriate, access to finance was a considerable
concern even prior to the crisis. Finance has been less available in FYR Macedonia compared to other
countries in the region. In addition to high interest rates, credit conditions (collateral requirements, fees,
etc.) have been generally tight, excluding a considerable part of the population from access to formal
sources of financing. According to the H B S datal2, consumer and investment loans accounted for only 2
percent of total available resources o f households in 2006. By 2007 this percentage increased to 3.9
percent before falling drastically to 1.2 percent in 2008 (potentially reflecting the tightening of monetary
policy since 2008). Furthermore, it appears that only a small part of the population has access to
traditional financing sources with the wealthiest decile accounting for 94 percent of all consumer and
investment loans. Less well-off households appear to rely more on unofficial sources of borrowing which
are overall much smaller (0.1 percent of total available resources) but are more equally distributed.

73.      Furthermore, although the resilience of the banking sector does not raise major immediate
concerns, a number of issues, if not tackled, could undermine stability of the sector going forward.
NPLs have increased and credit growth has slowed substantially since end-2008. After reaching the
bottom of 6.8 percent in 2008, the NPLs have been growing and as of June 2009, stood at 8.6 percent for
the system. Moreover the indirect credit risk, due to the unhedged foreign-exchange and floating-interest
rate exposures of most borrowers, constitutes a substantial risk for the banks and necessitates prudent
capital levels. In June 2009, the NPLs less provisions as a share of the capital have turned positive for the
first time since the beginning of 2007, a development that raises concerns about the ability o f some banks
to cope with the rapidly deteriorating credit portfolio quality. Despite overall satisfactory fundamentals,
the possible failure of individual banks cannot be ruled out which in turn could evolve into a larger crisis.
A potential crisis can be devastating for public confidence in the banking sector, which has been regained
very slowly following the near collapse in the early 1990's.




11
   The NBRM prudential measures included an increase in reserve requirements, risk weights for consumer loans,
credit cards and overdrafts exposures, and in loan- loss provisioning requirements. In addition, NBRM required
banks to improve matching o f assets and liabilities across currency and maturity.
12
   These statistics should be considered as indicative only as income sources in the HBS are considerably
underestimated. According to the HBS total average available resources per household was MKD 295 thousand a
year compared to estimated expenditures o f MKD 40 1 thousand a year.

74.      The main risk to the financial sector in the medium-term lies with possible pressures on the
fixed exchange rate regime, especially given FYR Macedonia's significant current account deficit
and high credit euroization. Recent pressures on the peg have been successfully withstood by the
NBRM with the use of FX reserves and increased interest rates. The latter, in combination with very low
inflation, has resulted in high real interest rates and impaired access to finance. Given the large external
imbalances, the preservation of the peg and the easing o f the credit crunch and lowering of real interest
rates can best be achieved through monetary and fiscal policies that help to maintain confidence in
macroeconomic stability. While the housing market does not appear to show any indications of price
bubbles, the on-going credit crunch and slipping domestic demand could increase downward pressures on
property prices in the near future.

75.     A strong financial sector, properly regulated and supervised is important for maintaining
macroeconomic stability as well as ensuring sufficiently competitive markets that will improve
access to financing. The authorities have already implemented a number o f measure^'^ to improve the
performance o f the financial sector and this operation will support measures to enhance crisis
preparedness. Critical constraints identified by the 2008 FSAP mission and an IMF assessment in early
2009 include: (i) lack o f contingency planning for crisis management by agencies responsible for the
financial safety net (MoF and NBRM); (ii)operational uncertainty about the lender-of-last-resort
functions (LOLR processes have never been tested and relevant operations manual has not been
                DIF resources limited and lack contingency liquidity; (vi) narrow grounds for the NBRM
developed); (iii)
to appoint temporary administrators; (v) uncertainties that limit the range of available bank resolution
models; and (vi) weakened NBRM's supervisory powers (resulting from a recent constitutional court
ruling).

76.     A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) among key stakeholders responsible for
resolution o f systemic financial crises is under preparation and will be the first step towards
efficient coordination, and adequate crisis preparedness and contingency planning. The MoU will
facilitate the creation of a framework for information exchange, consultations on financial stability and
crisis management among the MoF and the NBRM, including agreements on crisis communication
strategy, the lead crisis manager and definition and monitoring o f systemic risk, among others. The MoU
will also envisage establishment o f a Committee on Financial Stability at the higher policy level which
will follow procedures agreed upon in the MoU and meet regularly at all times and with necessary

  The sector i s generally liberalized, credit and property rights are improving, the regulatory framework i s sound
and credit information systems are improving. The public credit registry was recently upgraded while activities are
underway to establish a private registry with greater coverage (including also utilities). Initial consumer protection
legislation has also been implemented.

frequency in a crisis time. The committee should ensure that systemic risks are adequately monitored and
dealt with.

77.      While banking sector supervision i s broadly satisfactory, establishment of a Coordinating
Supervisory Committee should help harmonize regulation and supervisory practices and improve
information exchange and capacity building among the financial supervisors, as a first step towards
consolidation of supervision in the financial sector. While safeguarding the soundness and safety o f
the financial sector, the dominant banking sector must be considered as a priority in supervision.
Nevertheless, increased attention must also be given to the supervision o f other financial subsectors that
are likely to grow in importance, such as the leasing (Non-Bank Credit Institutions - NBCIs) sector which
i s currently not prudentially supervised. The Coordinating Committee should include the supervisors o f
all financial sector segments; the NBRM, SEC, MAPAS as well as the newly established ISA and the
MoF which i s responsible for oversight o f the NBCI.

78.     The authorities are also working to increase NBRM accountability and independence to
reach EU standards. To do so, a new Central Bank Law was drafted in 2007. The Law has been
subsequently revised by the NBRM and MoF based on comments from the IMF, EC and ECB, and i s at
the final stage for comments with the ECB and the EC before being submitted to the Parliament. Early
adoption of the new NBRM law will increase independence and accountability of the NBRM in accord
with the prevailing EU standards.



               IV.     BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

LINK TO CAS

79.     The proposed DPL was envisaged in the March 2009 CPS Progress Repod4. The FY07-10
FYR Macedonia Country Partnership Strategy was discussed by the Board on March 27, 2007.15 The
main pillars o f the Bank's support to the country were defined as: (i)fostering job-creating economic
growth and increasing living standards for all; and (ii)
                                                       improving governance and transparency in public
sector delivery to support a market economy. A CPS Progress Report was approved by the Board on
March 4, 2009. It found that the two pillars o f the CPS, and its underlying theme o f supporting the
country's objective o f EU membership, remain consistent with government priorities. I t also confirmed
the overall direction o f the World Bank Group program while introducing some adjustments to the
evolving partnership through the remainder of the CPS period, including the possibility for provision of
DPL support.

80.       The proposed DPL contributes to the following CPS outcomes: (i)        labor market: increasing
flexibility o f labor market outcomes and decreasing the tax wedge; (ii)
                                                                       health: improve the efficiency and
transparency o f Health Insurance Fund Operations; and (iii) social protection - improve administration
and targeting o f cash benefits and strengthen the pension system.

COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

81.     The Bank maintains close working contacts with the IMF and other donors assisting the
Government for the purposes o f harmonizing policy recommendations, seeking synergies among
the respective operations, and avoiding overlaps. The World Bank team remains in close coordination
with the IMF resulting in largely shared views of the economic situation in the country. This operation
may also leverage assistance from other donors. The Dutch Government has allocated Euro 7 million as
DPL co-financing and in addition i s supporting a technical assistance trust fund which provides important
assistance to key components o f the DPL agenda (health sector Treasury function, Law on public sector
wages etc.).

82.     The Bank has maintained a robust dialogue with the donor community on issues related to
the proposed DPL. On issues related to labor taxation, the Bank benefits from regular consultations with
the IMF Technical Assistance Team on improving tax administration. The policy dialogue on energy
poverty i s informed by work done by USAID consultants. The Bank's coordination and cooperation with
the European Union, the most important current and future development partner of FYR Macedonia, i s
increasing and deepening. In addition, the Bank i s at the forefront o f the process o f the introduction of
Program-Based Approach to Donor coordination.

RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

83.     The World Bank's lending program consists of fourteen lending operations and two grants,
totaling US%300million, grouped into four outcome clusters: i)the growth and competitiveness cluster;
ii)business environment cluster; iii)the human development cluster and iv) the infrastructure cluster.

 84.      A number o f Bank operations will support the proposed DPL operation. There i s an
 important direct link between the Conditional Cash Transfers project and the proposed DPL, and both
 operations are expected to reinforce each other in a number of important areas, including on the adoption
 of a suitable policy framework for the improved functioning of the social safety net system. Synergies are
 also expected between the Social Protection Implementation Loan and the proposed DPL in the area o f
 pensions and pension reform. The Bank i s also ready to provide technical assistance (TA) through its
just-in-time ESW and analytical activities, for example on further progress in public administration
 reform or energy-related issues.

85.      The operation builds on the successful engagement under the previous DPL series. Previous
DPL series supported the competitiveness of the economy through improvements in the business
environment, including by cutting costs of businesses by improving the functioning of the labor market
through changes in the legal framework. This operation continues to support the competitiveness o f the
economy by lowering labor costs; this time through reforms of the payroll system. Previous DPLs also
supported reforms in the financial sector, including through improvements in the supervisory practices in
the banking sector (the support o f the Supervisory Development Plan in the NBRM). This time, a similar
objective i s being pursued by supporting the endorsement o f a Memorandum of Understandingon crisis
preparedness between the MoF and the NBRM as well as establishing o f a Coordinating Supervisory
Committee with the aim to improve the supervisory practices for the entire financial sectors system.
Finally, the structural reforms related to the remuneration o f the public administration as well as the
introduction o f the Treasury system in the public health sector support by the current DPL series can be
directly linked to public sector governance activities supported by the previous DPL series (Civil Service
Law, private/public sector salary survey, strengthening ex-ante controls over hospital spending).

LESSONS LEARNED

86.     The World Bank has been actively using Development Policy Lending as the principal tool
to assist the FYR Macedonian authorities with the design and implementation of important
structural reforms since 2000. Over the past 15 years, the Bank and the Authorities have successfully
implemented reforms supported by DPL-type o f operations in the financial and enterprise sectors, public
administration as well a in the areas o f business environment and investment climate. The operations
                        s
have introduced a number of reforms which have contributed greatly to the development of the country.
With follow-through in mind, the proposed DPL series in part reflects a continuation o f reforms initiated
under the previous (PSMAL and PDPL) series (see para 85).

87.     The FYR Macedonian experience with DPLs suggests that a broader scope for the DPL
could be considered i f there i s strong government commitment. Despite having a relatively broad
scope, earlier DPL-type operations in the country have been successful. This experience confirms the
importance o f "ownership" and "criticality" as good practice principles for DPL operations. The
experience o f earlier DPL programs suggests that a broader focus could be supported provided the good
practice principles are met.

88.      Institutional continuity, on both sides (the Bank's and Client's), i s important for success.
An important factor in the ability o f the Government to push through a broad reform agenda i s the
existence o f a strong coordinating and leading role, which in the FYR Macedonian case was provided by
the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry was able to do this, in large part, due to strong internal capacity in
some of i t s departments and their extensive experience in dealing with the World Bank. At the same
time, the Bank's satisfactory performance in design and preparation o f the program was, to a large degree,
due to the continuity o f the Bank team throughout the l i f e o f previous DPL-series.

89.     A strong analytical basis i s needed to design effective operations. Analytical work can play an
important role to crystallize clearly the areas to be supported under development policy lending, ensuring
at the same time a strong government buy-in at the preparation stage and a strong commitment during
implementation. Bank analytical work that has helped inform the dialogue with the Government and
other donors, and has anchored the scope and substance o f the proposed DPL, i s summarized in Table 10.

90.     Another lesson learned i s that reforms supported by policy-based lending tend to be more
effectively implemented when supported by investment projects and critical technical assistance by
the Bank and other donors. The proposed DPL program i s reinforced by the Bank's social protection
and conditional cash transfers projects. (see para 8 3 ) Technical assistance in areas broadly related to the
DPL i s provided by the IMF (on tax and administration and payroll reforms), the EU (Central Bank Law
and Customs administration) and the Dutch Government (supporting IMF and WB programs).

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

91.     I n recent years, the Bank has undertaken extensive analytical work in areas covered by the
proposed Operation. The recently completed Country Economic Memorandum focused on the reforms
needed to improve growth performance by increasing investments and improving export performance. I t
also called for greater inclusive policies (including on education and social policies) to ensure shared
growth. Also, the 2009 Poverty Assessment shed light on the reasons for the relatively stagnant living
conditions in the country including the functioning o f the social safety net. The 2007 Public Expenditure
Review analyzed spending patterns in a number o f sectors, including education, health and social
protection. The 2008 FSAP noted considerable progress in the financial sector but also provided
recommendations to strengthen its resilience. In addition to the standard ESW documents, the Bank
produced a number o f on-demand analysis on various issues raised by the Government, including a recent

Global Crisis. The Policy Note discusses the implication o f the crisis over the short and medium-term
macro-fiscal framework and discusses issues and provides recommendations in key sectors. The Note

V.        THE PROPOSED FIRST PROGRAMMATIC DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN
                                   (DPL1)

OPERATION DESCRIPTION

93.     The DPL 1 i s the first o f two development policy lending operations to be executed
sequentially in 2009 and 2010. The DPL series will support concrete Government reforms in the
following areas:
             a.   to manage the impact of the global crisis by maintaining a sound macroeconomic and
                  fiscal framework;
             b. to cushion the impact on the poor and vulnerable by enhancing social protection systems;
                and
             c. to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector by addressing potential vulnerabilities.
94.      The operation, although modest in size, will support critical reforms needed to mitigate the
crisis.   The proposed operation will cover about 10 percent of the projected fiscal deficit in 2010
respectively. The measures supported by the DPL are critical for the implementation of reforms that will
protect the most vulnerable and support resumption of growth over the medium-term.
95.     A policy matrix i s attached at the end of this Document. The remainder of this Section
outlines policy areas supported by the proposed DPL in greater detail.

PILLAR I:IMPROVING PUBLIC EXPENDITURE OUTCOMES

96.     The proposed set o f reforms focuses on fiscal policies that will support sustainable
macroeconomic outcomes, with a particular focus on monitoring and mitigating the impact o f the
payroll reforms. The set of macro-policies implemented by the authorities are expected to result in
sustainable fiscal balances and reduced external vulnerability of the economy. The proposed deficit of
2.8 percent of GDP in 2009 and a slight reduction in 2010 should not endanger the fiscal sustainability
given the size and structure of public debt. The government's intention to secure most of the needed
financing externally should also mitigate concerns regarding the sustainability o f the external balance.

97.      The team will continue to carefully monitor the execution of the 2009 Budget and the preparation
o f the 2010 Budget, and will maintain an active dialogue with the authorities and the IMF regarding
economic developments.

The specific measures are:

      0   Overall fiscal framework

                  deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP (DPLl prior action)
             o    Implementation of 2010 budget as envisaged and corrective measures taken if necessary
                  (DPL2 trigger)

                system (reduce indexation coefficients from 50:50 CP1:wages to 50:20 CP1:wages in
                2009) (DPL1 benchmark)
           o    Improve long-term sustainability of the pension system reflecting findings o f analysis of

PILLAR 1 1 STRENGTHENING RESILIENCE OF THE FINANCIAL SECTOR

99.      The DPL series supports measures aimed at enhancing the resilience of the financial sector
to the crisis. These include both immediate tools such as further enhancement of the crisis preparedness
framework that the authorities have started developing in the past few months, as well as measures aimed
at addressing medium term and structural issues such as the adoption of a central bank law, which will
increase the autonomy and accountability o f the NBRM, and a policy to implement consolidated
supervision including prospective integration of the existing sectoral supervisory agencies for increased
effectiveness o f prudential supervision.

The specific measures are:

             o   MoU on crisis preparedness outlining key responsibilities and coordination mechanisms
                 endorsed (DPL 1 benchmark)

Box 4: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
The DPL program i s in line with the Government's reform agenda and its policy response to the global economic
crisis. The main objectives o f the DPL support the near-term priority o f the Government (as articulated in the
second 2009 Supplementary Budget) to "strike a balance between the need to fiscally stimulate the economy
while preserving macroeconomic stability and social cohesion" as well as the longer-term strategic priorities o f
the Government (as articulated in the Government's work programs) to increase employment and improve the
living conditions o f the citizens and advance EU and NATO integration. The Bank's analytic work (the Poverty
Assessment, Public Expenditure Review, FSAP, Policy Notes on Crisis Response and Labor Markets TA) has
contributedsubstantially to the design of the Government's program.
Principle 2: Agree up front with the Government and otherfinancialpartners on a coordinated
accountabilityframework
The DPL series i s summarized in an agreed policy matrix which outlines actions over the next two years with
clear outcome goals. The Minister o f Finance coordinates the program for the Government and assigns specific
responsibility for implementingand monitoring the program to various Government agencies. The Government
and the Bank have also closely coordinated the reform program with other development partners. The Bank
team regularly interacts with the European Commission and the Dutch Government. The Dutch Government
financed technical assistance to support the design and implementation of the reforms and could potentially
provide co-financing. Cooperation arrangements with the IMF are sound with regular contacts and exchanges o f
views between the two teams.
Principle 3: Customize the accountabilityframework and modalities o Bank support to country
                                                                          f
circumstances
The reform program i s based on, and i s part o f the Government's strategies and programs. I t reflects short-term
measures to respond to the crisis as well as the more medium-term structural and institutional reforms needed
across sectors for improving efficiency o f public spending and delivery o f services. During operation
preparation, the Cabinet will review and endorse the reform program.
Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement
The DPL program focuses on actions that are critical in terms of achieving the set outcome goals. The DPLl
program consists o f 6 prior actions and 6 benchmarks.
Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-basedJinancia1
support
The prior actions included in the program have largely been drawn from the extensive AAA activity o f the Bank
which has been extensively discussed and agreed upon with the Government. Progress made with the
implementation of reforms and achievement of outcome goals will be monitored on a regular basis: a progress
matrix, which outlines the status o f reforms and outcome indicators, will be updated periodically and circulated
among ministries and agencies.




                               VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

 100. This section reviews the poverty and social impact of key reforms in the policy matrix under
DPL 1. The global financial crisis has hit FYR Macedonia hard reversing years o f moderate to robust
growth. Yet, even in years o f economic prosperity and prior to the onset o f the food and fuel crises,
absolute poverty rates remained stagnant (see para. 12) at 19 percent o f the population. FYR Macedonia
i s characterized by relatively high inequality based upon the Household Budget Survey (HBS) which may
explain the lack o f progress in poverty reduction. As the government addresses the impact o f the crisis on



                                                             31
the population through a series of reforms supported by the World Bank, new social protection measures
are under consideration. The aid program options to help the poor with energy costs under DPL 2
requires further poverty and social impact analysis which will be carried out.

 101. The poverty and social impact o f the first two public expenditure management reforms in
the policy matrix-the implementation of the 2009 budget and the adoption o f the 2010 budget-is
likely to be positive. The government i s pursuing countercyclical fiscal policy that may partially offset
the impact of the economic contraction on the population. In 2009 and 2010, public expenditures as a
share of GDP are projected to be 34.7 percent and 35.1 percent respectively compared to 35.1 percent in
2008. As seen in Table 5, in 2009 the government has protected wages, goods and services, and transfers
in proportional terms as a share of GDP but also in real terms. In particular, the social safety net transfers
for pensions, social benefits, and unemployment benefits increased in real terms. Moreover, as noted
above, the government's Supplementary Budget maintained the allocation for well performing social
programs. Thus, at the aggregate level, the government i s taking steps to mitigate the adverse impact of
the crisis on the population, in particular the elderly, the unemployed, and the poor. However, certain
social groups may be by-passed such as the working poor.

102. The public sector nominal wage and employment freezes do not adversely affect the level o f
poverty in FYR Macedonia. The minimum public sector net wage rate (including allowances) was an
estimated MKD 8,100 per month at the end of 2008 which exceeds the World Bank estimated absolute
poverty line of MKD 3,436. Though there i s a wage freeze in nominal terms, the decline in real wages i s
likely to be negligible given the very low inflation rate in 2009. The recipient o f the minimum wage rate
falls in the top 40 percent of the population based upon the average consumption expenditures per capita.
But, as the household size increases to above two persons, even public sector wage earners could fall into
poverty without supplemental sources of household income such as a second earner." The relative
position o f public sector employees in the labor market may change, either being set back (or moving up)
in case average private sector net wages increase (decrease) during this period. The employment freeze
for the public sector should not adversely impact the poor, though this policy could s t i l l have an adverse
impact on job seekers who may have been queuing for jobs in the public sector.

103. The reduction in the social insurance contributions on gross wages should raise the welfare
o f formal private sector workers across the board but could have adverse consequences for future
pensioners. Formal wages are a significant source o f income for the working population. For the
population as a whole, an estimated 55 percent o f total income was from non-agriculture formal wages,
while for the poor, the proportion was 45 percent.I8 A lowering of social contribution rates translates into
an increase in take-home pay and should improve the welfare of formal sector workers and their
dependents and potentially even raise some out of poverty. Yet, this reform could have an
intergenerational impact with current workers benefiting to the detriment of future retirees (including
themselves). In order to ensure sustainability of the pension system, declining per capita contributions
have to be offset by more contributions over the lifetime of the worker (higher retirement age or more
contributors) or lower pension payouts. Second, this de facto increase in net formal wages could lead to
either a temporary or permanent widening of the income gap between formal and informal sector workers.
An estimated 25 percent of the employed do not work in the formal sector nor pay into the pension




" The HBS's labor market module does not allow for the identification o f the sector o f employment and,
consequently, the poverty status o f households with a public sector wage earner.

system. Though both poor and non-poor work in the informal sector, the 2006 H B S indicates the greater
reliance o f the poorest quintile on the informal sector."

 104, Amending the Pension and Disability Insurance Law to improve the indexation coefficients
i s not expected to increase poverty or worsen the situation o f the poor, though in the long term it
may adversely impact the relative position of the elderly. The amendment does not preclude pension
adjustments but rather modifies the rate of increase to narrow the gap between pension increases and the
rate of inflation. In the current low inflation environment, pensions are likely to increase marginally in
real terms. Poverty rates among the 65+ year olds are about 15 percent of the age cohort; this represents
the lowest incidence o f any age group. However, poverty rates among the elderly with dependents
increased between 2002 and 2006 to one in five elderly, indicating that pension income i s being used to
support multiple generations within the same household. An increase in unemployment may lead to
higher dependence of families on the elderly's pension income and potentially to higher poverty rates in
the absence o f government programs to mitigate the crisis impact. In the longer term, the relative position
of pensioners may decline over time a their pensions fail to keep up with income growth of wage
                                          s
earners. However, this could be offset by change in savings behavior and especially an increase in
personal savings during the income earning years.

 105.   The Government's policy action of ensuring that the level of spending for social protection
in the October 2009 Supplementary Budget i s no lower than the original 2009 budget will help to
direct resources towards mitigating the impact of the crisis on the poor. While, the Social Financial
Assistance spending was preserved at the same level as in 2008, the overall government allocation to
social benefits increased during 2008 - 2009 by 6.7 percent to MKD 4.3 billion thus ensuring that more
resources were available for helping the poor. The recent slowdown in the economy i s likely to increase
the level of poverty in comparison to 2008 and, thus, demand for social assistance from the government.
Moreover, the enactment of the new Law on Social Protection which addresses the efficiency of the
safety net may serve to release resources that are currently leaked to the non-poor. Though FYR
Macedonia has among the best performing social assistance programs in the Europe and Central Asia
region, an estimated 60 percent o f program beneficiaries were not poor in 2006. Moreover, coverage of
the poor could be improved since only about 40 percent o f the extreme poor and 20 percent o f the
moderately poor live in households which receive social benefit (based on 2006 data). In order to track
improvements in the targeting effectiveness o f the social protection programs, the HBS will need to be
strengthened to better capture changes in absolute poverty in both rural and urban areas and key
characteristics such as employment status.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

 106. The specific country policies supported by the Operation are not likely to have significant
effects on the country's environment and natural resources. The measures contemplated under the
loan are primarily geared towards supporting government reforms in fiscal management, social protection
and the financial sector. None of the sectors included in the Operation are expected to have any direct
significant links to the environment. Although the nominal wage and employment freeze in the public
sector will make it difficult to attract and retain competent staff if continued for a longer period of time,
the current macroeconomic environment (low inflation and limited private sector job opportunities)
should limit any significant negative impact on the enforcement o f environmentalregulations in 2009 and
2010.



l 9 The share o f non-agriculture income from informal sources was 15 percent o f total income o f the poorest quintile
compared to 7 percent o f the population as a whole.


                                                            33
 107. The legal framework for environmental management has undergone significant reforms
along the lines of the EU acquis. New laws on Environment, Nature, Air Quality and Waste
Management have been passed by the Parliament, in compliance with EU requirements. Further
regulation, regarding the drafting o f secondary legislation in the environmental sector as a whole i s an on-
going process, guided and supervised with EU technical assistance. FYR Macedonia has also signed the
South Eastern European Energy Community Treaty which subjects it to key pieces of the acquis, notably
the Large Combustion Plants Directive. This directive places restrictions on local pollution emissions
(sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter). The country also ratified the Kyoto Protocol.

CONSULTATIONS

 108.   The Government's program outlined above largely draws from the VMRO-DPMNE's
Election manifestos for the 2006 and 2008 rounds of Parliamentary elections. According to the
documents, the program reflect inputs from a comprehensive consultation process with the expert
community in the country and the non-government sector, including employee representatives, chambers
o f commerce, civil-society organizations etc. The Program was discussed extensively during the
elections and continues to provide the overall direction for the activities o f the Government. Furthermore,
the overarching goals across the political spectrum are broadly similar, which provides relatively broad
consensus for the reform program.

 109. The program clearly identifies macroeconomic stability as a key pre-condition for
sustainable and strong growth o f the economy. I t calls for prudent fiscal policy and a sustainable
deficit level as well as a reduction of non-priority spending and an increase in capital spending. The
reduction in contribution rates i s also a major theme o f the program. The election manifesto call for
reforms in social protection to improve protection o f the most vulnerable largely along the lines outlined
above (i.e. reform o f the legal framework, investments in the information systems and efforts to reduce
leakage and expand coverage). Also, the program calls for more effective management o f resources in
the health sector (i.e. the introduction o f the Treasury function) and clearly identifies the need for
revisions to the Basic Benefits Package. While the program was prepared before the current global crisis
it s t i l l called for actions to improve the performance of the financial sector, including in the area o f
supervision o f the overall financial sector.

110. The authorities have a continuous relatively extensive consultation process. The payroll
reform (including the reduction in payroll contributions) i s a result of continued calls by the business
community to reduce the tax burden and simplify procedures and has been discussed and endorsed at the
Socio-Economic Council, a tripartite body that brings together the representatives o f the Government, the
Unions and the employers' associations. The measure to reduce pension indexation in 2009 was agreed
during bilateral meetings between the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy and the Association of
Pensioners. The new Law on Social Protection was extensively discussed during the Parliamentary
procedure for its adoption (between Readings and in Committee discussions), with some NGOs also
providing comments, some o f which were reflected in the final text of the Law. Given the impact o f the
crisis, the Unions also provided support to the expenditure cuts envisaged with the Supplementary
Budgets, including the measure to freeze wages and employment.

11 1.   Consultations and discussions o f Bank analytical work played a catalytic role in designing
policy options and mobilizing stakeholders. For instance, the findings of the 2008 Financial Sector
Assessment largely informed the Government's program in the financial sector outlined above.
Furthermore, the findings of the 2007 Public Expenditure Review, served as the analytical underpinning
for many of the reforms in the education, health and pensions sectors. The findings o f the recent CEM
also informed the government agenda on trade facilitation. The broad consultation process in the
preparation o f all Bank operations have resulted in broad consensus for the recommendations proposed.


                                                        34
 112. M o r e generally, the decision making process in the country allows for significant input from
the non-government sector. The parliament i s the legislative branch o f the Government which
promulgates legislation. In principle, legislation requires a simple majority in order to be adopted with
the exception o f systemic laws (requiring two-thirds majority) and laws referring the issues related to
ethnicities (requiring so-called Badinter majority, i.e. simple majority o f all Members of Parliament
(MPs) plus simple majority of MPs which are representatives o f ethnic minorities). Each MP, the
government as well a at least 10,000 voters can propose legislation. Citizens or any group o f citizens can
                       s
submit an initiative to adopt legislation to the entities authorized to propose legislation or provide
comments on proposed legislation. The procedure to adopt legislation i s regulated by the Rulebook of the
Parliament and allows for consultation during discussions in Committees or between Readings (most
Laws have to pass 2 Readings before adoption). Matters related to accession to the EU are also discussed
by the National Council on European Integration, which also comprises of representatives o f the non-
government sector (unions, chambers, religious institutions etc.). Once submitted to Parliament, all
legislation i s posted on its web-site.

113.      The framework in place allows for extensive consultative process in decision making,
although it i s not entirely clear how effective these are. The Rulebook on Government operations
regulates the work o f the Government and establishes the Economic Council and the Legal Council which
should provide expert services to the Government. The Rulebook regulates the cooperation o f the
Government with local government units, public enterprises, institutions and services, political parties,
companies and associations o f citizens. The Rulebook on Creation o f Policies instructs public bodies to
undertake "transparent consultations" with all stakeholders. Also, the Rulebook on Strategic Planning
stipulates that social partners, other stakeholders, NGOs etc should also be represented in the preparation
o f strategic plans. The Government rulebook prescribes that all new legislation must be accompanied by
fiscal impact analysis and regulatory impact analysis. Regulatory impact assessment was only recently
introduced to check the impact o f any new legislation on the business environment and also involves a
process o f consultation with the business community. Finally, draft legislation i s increasingly being made
available on the web-sites o f the government bodies for review and comments.

IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

114. The M O F will be responsible for overall implementation of the proposed operation and for
reporting process and coordinating actions among other concerned ministries and agencies. The
Bank will monitor actions and review progress o f the implementation of the proposed operation, a well
                                                                                                 s
as the subsequent actions o f the Government program by using the short term and overall program
outcomes outlined in the Policy Matrix.

 1 15. At the same time, the overall status o f the program will be monitored during supervision to
determine whether the specific conditions of the proposed operation have changed. Supervision
missions will not only allow the Bank to continue the policy dialogue with the institutions involved in the
implementation o f the program o f reform, but will also ensure synergies with other donors to avoid
conflicting advice to the Government in the policy and technical areas involved in the reforms.

FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

1 16.    The 2007 CFA and the 2004 CFAA stated that the overall fiduciary risk for the P F M system
(including procurement) was considered moderate to significant at the time o f those reviews. The
"significant" rating was related to the assessment o f procurement arrangements, while the financial
management assessment for the aspects considered in the CFA was considered "moderate". The financial
management risks continue to be moderate although there has been significant improvement since the



                                                       35
2007 CFA report. A recent (2009) review of the National Public Procurement System noted
improvements in the procurement system.

117.     Public procurement: Improvements have taken place after the 2002 CPAR noted several
deficiencies in the Law on Public Procurement (LPP). A new LPP in line with international standards
(however not harmonized with the EU acquis) was enacted in 2004 as part of the Public Sector
Management Adjustment Loan (PSMAL). The Government adopted comprehensive implementing
regulations, promulgated standard procurement documents and forms of contract, and established a state
administrative body for public procurement within the MOF (made fully operational with staff, resources
and terms o f reference). The law was amended in 2005 to introduce electronic procurement, a "one-stop-
shop" system for central registration o f tenderers' qualifications, and the requirement for publishing all
contract notices on the website o f the Public Procurement Bureau. In 2008, a new Law on Public
Procurement, fully harmonized with the EU acquis was adopted and activities are underway to ensure its
effective implementation. Consequently, the review o f national Public Procurement System undertaken
in 2009 noted considerably improvement in the legislation, some improvement in implementation and
relatively limited progress in remedies.

118.      Budgeting, accounting and reporting: The Government has made significant progress in
improving central budgeting processes. Improvements include the implementation of a multiyear fiscal
plan, the preparation of government priorities and expenditure ceilings for the coming fiscal year, and the
introduction of functional budget classification coding. Extrabudgetary funds (EBFs) and agency
accounts have been integrated under the Treasury single account (TSA). Improved ex-ante controls
resulting from the TSA now apply to all budget entities and EBFs. Budget reporting has improved, with
MOF producing comprehensive reports for the central government using the TSA within 40 days from the
end o f the month.

119. Internal controls and internal audit: Following the adoption o f the Law on Internal Audit in
2004, the MOF implemented internal audit units across the government and the municipalities (supported
by the DPL1). The number o f trained staff increased from 57 in 2005 to 79 in 2006. Internal auditors
conducted about 100 audits, about half o f which were performed by the MOF central internal audit unit.
The authorities have recently (2009) adopted a new Law on Public Internal Financial Control (PIFC)

 120. External audit: There has been substantial progress in strengthening the Supreme Audit Office
(SAO). The S A 0 i s independent from the executive branch and i t s mandate covers all public sector
activities. The government increased resources for the SA0 and amended legislation to: require an
annual audit opinion on the government's annual financial statements; require the auditor to summarize
the audit findings for the year into common themes on high-risk areas for the government to address;
adopt a risk-based audit approach to the annual audit planning process; report on the government's
progress in implementing current and all outstanding audit recommendations; perform performance-based
audits; and implement international auditing standards covering all aspects o f its work.

121.    Further improvements in several areas o f procurement and public finance management
could be necessary, including: (i)improved reporting on state-owned enterprises; (ii)improved legal
framework for public procurement in line with EU requirements and establishing an effective and
independent complaints review body; (iii)strengthened internal financial controls in the MOES and
consolidation of progress on financial management in the HIF; and (iii)
                                                                      improved SA0 public reporting.

122. Anticorruption measures: Several anticorruption measures have been put in place, including the
internal and external audit functions, anticorruption laws and amendments. The fight against corruption i s
an important feature of the new government's program. Institution building and improvements o f
standards iri the areas of the judiciary, police, health, and customs i s targeted as well as strengthening o f


                                                        36
controls and punishments for those who do not respect laws and regulations. The areas mentioned are
also supported by the Bank, the EAR and other donors. Even if more transparency i s introduced and civil
society engaged in this fight as planned by the Government, the level o f corruption will remain a
challenge. The ongoing improvements in the areas o f public procurement, internal audit, and
strengthening of the role o f the SA0 contribute to the fight against corruption. The 2008 BEEPS shows a
marked improvement (compared to the 2005 round o f the survey) in the percentage o f firms indicating
corruption as a problem of doing business.

123. The latest IMF update o f the safeguards assessment was completed in February 2006. (The
previous assessment was done in 2003). The update found that the NBRM had taken steps to strengthen
i t s safeguards framework, and recommendations from the earlier assessment had been implemented. This
progress notwithstanding, the report made recommendations in the reporting and audit areas, including:
(i)   review by the NBRM internal audit unit o f processes for compiling monetary data reported to the IMF
under the program; and (ii)   completion o f annual external audits on a timely basis as prescribed by the
NBRM Law. The NBRM has acted on these recommendations.

DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

124. Disbursement and auditing arrangements reflect the moderate risk for the public financial
management system.

 125. The proposed DPL will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for development policy
lending. The untied budget support will be disbursed in compliance with the agreed prior actions and
will not be tied to specific purchases. No procurement requirements will be needed. Upon approval o f
the Loan and notification by the Bank o f Loan effectiveness, the Government will submit a withdrawal
application. At the request of the Government, the Bank will disburse the Loan, less the amount o f the
front-end fee, and the net proceeds o f the Loan will be deposited in the Treasury's Euro account in the
NBRM, this account being available for budget financing. This Treasury Euro account forms part o f the
foreign exchange reserves of the country. The Borrower shall ensure that upon deposit o f the net
proceeds of the Loan into said account, an equivalent amount will be credited in the Borrower's budget
management system. If after the proceeds are deposited in the NBRM account the proceeds of the Loan
are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the Loan Agreement, the Bank will require the Borrower to
promptly, upon notice from the Bank, refund an amount equal to the amount o f said payment to the Bank.
Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such request shall be cancelled.

 126. The administration and accounting of the loan will be the responsibility o f the MOF. The
standard country rules will be followed by treasury for administration and accounting. The MOF will
provide the Bank within 30 days with a confirmation letter stating that the DPL funds have been received
and deposited into the deposit account designated by the borrower. Considering the Bank's knowledge o f
the public finance management systems, the ongoing improvements o f these systems and the assessment
o f the NBRM made by the MF, no audit will be necessary o f the deposit account.

RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

127. The proposed DPL carries moderate risks. The country went into the financial crisis with a
sound fiscal position. At the same time, the large current account deficit remains a critical vulnerability.
In addition, institutional and political risks also exist. Risks are also mitigated by the programmatic DPL
design which i s intended to leave some flexibility as to the pace and scope of the reform program.

128. Uncertainty of global economic outlook and the size of the current account deficit. Further
external shocks or a prolonged delay of the recovery will impact the economy negatively, e.g. prolonged


                                                       37
recession in EU and lower demand for exports than currently envisaged and lower private sector capital
inflows. The main macroeconomic risk i s that balance o f payment shortfalls will deplete reserves
(although this risk has receded in recent months). Public debt levels could increase significantly, while
the financial sector stability would be undermined given its high degree o f euroization. Additional
external financial support may be needed, and the Government has indicated that it will approach the IMF
in 20 10 if the need arises.

129. Economic risks are somewhat mitigated by the recent signs of stabilization as well as the
relatively favorable initial external and fiscal debt levels and structure. Progress towards EU
accession would also help (while setbacks to EU membership are a downside risk). In addition, the
government's decent track record on prudent macroeconomic policies give some credibility to their
policies and indications to approach the IMF in case the situation deteriorates further. At the moment the
authorities do not see a need to approach the IMF; views of the Government and the IMF appear to have
converged which should considerably ease the process of reaching an agreement in case the authorities
request it.

130.     Capacity o f some public sector institutions to design and implement ambitious reforms,
while much improved over the past few years, remains relatively weak. Institutional capacity i s
uneven across various parts o f the Government. While some parts o f the Government involved in this
operation have decent capacity (NBRM on supervision, MLSP on pension policies), relatively weak
institutional capacity in other sectors raises concern. Improving i t i s an important component of this
Operation, but institutional change comes slowly. The Bank will try to mitigate this risk by providing
TA, leveragingthe support o f investment loans and active dialogue with the counterparts.

13 1. Political risks appear more moderate. The government has a stable majority in all levels o f
Government and next elections are few years away. However, the name issue could potentially trigger
some political instability. Last year's veto over NATO membership does not appear to have undermined
commitment for reforms. However, one more veto (this time on start of negotiations for EU membership)
could trigger a reform fatigue and remove a big reform anchor.

Annex 5: Government Definitions

The Central Government consists o f the Government and i t s services, 14 Ministries and 1 Secretariat
as well as a number o f Agencies, Bureaus, Directorates, Offices and other entities (referred to as "first-
line" Budget users). In addition, there are entities affiliated t o these (schools, institutes, courts and
other entities established within ministries) typically referred to as "second-line Budget users". Since
2005, the Central Government definition was expanded to include the four extra-budgetary Funds
(Pensions and Disability Insurance Fund, the Health Insurance Fund, the Employment Agency and the
State Roads Agency) which administer the Government's social (PDIF and EA), pensions (PDIF),
health (HIF), labor (EA) and road infrastructure (SRA) policies.

The General Government includes the Central Government and local municipalities. The number and
size o f the local government as well as i t s competencies changed significantly during the transition
period. The country started the transition period with a relatively small number (34) o f larger
municipalities with extensive competencies in education, housing, public utilities etc. The 1995 L a w
on territorial division increased the number o f municipalities to 123. However, by then, their
competencies were significantly reduced and remained concentrated in public utilities. As a result,
municipalities' expenditures in 2004 accounted for only 1.8 percent o f GDP, while they employed
around 0.25 percent o f total employment in the economy.

Greater decentralization was a key pillar o f the Ohrid Framework Agreement which ended the 2001
conflict. With the new 2004 L a w on territorial division the number o f municipalities was scaled back
to 83 (plus Metropolitan Skopje area), while the new L a w o n competencies o f Local Governments
extended the municipal competencies in urbanism and spatial planning, education, limited social
services etc. The new L a w on property taxes and amendments to the Personal Income Tax and the
Value Added Tax laws ensured greater financial resources for municipalities. Lacking official data,
employment in municipalities is expected to have doubled as personnel from Central institutions have
been taken over and new staff has been employed. The expenditures o f municipalities are estimated to
have increased to 4.7 percent o f GDP in 2008 (out o f which 3.4 percent o f G D P are actually transfers
from the Central Government.

Entities owned by the Government commercially operate in number o f sectors. A number o f entities
at the municipal level perform functions like public services and utilities (water supply and sewage,
waste disposal). In addition, there are a number o f State-level public entities which provide goods and
services mostly concentrated in agriculture and fisheries ("Makedonski Sum?,), energy ("ELEM, -
generation and "MEPSO" - transmission o f electrical energy, "GA-MA" natural gas distributor),
transport ("Macedonian Railways", "Macedonia Airports", "Makedonija Pat,') etc.

Finally, the State owns minority stakes in number o f enterprises and owns M B D P (Macedonian Bank
for development promotion). A massive sell-off o f shares in 2006 reduced the State's portfolio but it
s t i l l remains the owner o f 35 percent o f the shares in the Telekom, as w e l l as various percentages in
other legal entities. As part o f the anti-crisis measures, the Government converted into equity its
claims on a few loss making enterprises.
