APPRAISAL OF
THE EVROS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Evros Development Project is a part of the overall development
program of the relatively less prosperous prefecture (nomos) of Evros which
has an area of 4,240 km2 and a population of 138,000. About half of the popu-
lation falls in the target group, having less than one-third of the national
average income. Evros is the most easterly of the three prefectures that make
up the region of Thrace. The project is multisectoral and is designed to com-
plement and coordinate the Government's on-going development activity in the
nomos and provide a model for integrated development which can be replicated
elsewhere in Greece. The Bank's participation would provide an organization
and a Fund to ensure continuity of speedy and inLpgrated development of the
resource potential of the whole nomos. It is broadly focused on improving the
quality of life, raising the incomes of beneficiaries to reduce regional in-
come disparities, and upgrading the institutional framework. The project
would finance extension of a sugar beet processing factory, irrigation, flood
control, roads, support for extension and research, forest exploitation and
reforestation, technical schools and social infrastructure.
ii.       Estimated project cost including physical contingencies and expected
price increases would be US$81.1 million equivalent with a foreign exchange
component of US$35.0 million or about 43%. The proposed US$35 million Bank
loan would finance 100% foreign exchange component of the project. Civil
works and equipment costing about US$57.2 million will be procured through
international competitive bidding.
iii.      Project contracting, except for the Orestias sugar factory com-
ponent, would be done locally for all civil works and for urgently needed
equipment. All major equipment items will be procured through the Ministry
of Commerce. Planning, design and execution will be done by the respective
existing departments at Alexandroupolis. The Orestias sugar factory will
be handled by the Hellenic Sugar Industry (HSI) assisted by international
consultants.
iv.       At full development in 1986 (except reforestation component), the
net value of annual incremental production to the economy would be about
US$7.3 million. The investment per beneficiary would be US$590. The economic
rate of return to the project, including all investment costs, would be 120.
It would rise to 16% if costs of components for which benefits have not been
quantified are excluded. These components include social infrastructure
investments and some very small components which together account for 22%
of total project costs. Per capita incremental income of a typical farm
family of four in the Erythropotamos valley, with four hectares, after pay-
ment of water charges would be US$340 which would raise the present income by
about 60%. The expansion of the sugar factory would enable growing of high
value sugar beet on 4,000 additional ha, thereby increasing farm incomes.
Individual benefits of social infrastructure, though difficult to quantify,
would be substantial.



- ii -
v.        The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$35.0 million for a
period of 15 years including a grace period of 3 years on country grounds.
The borrower will be the Hellenic State which will on-lend US$14.0 million
to the Hellenic Sugar Industry at 11% interest for 12 years including a 3
years grace period.



APPRAISAL OF
THE EVROS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
GREECE
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the Hellenic State has requested a Bank loan of
US$35.0 million to partly Linance the multisectoral Evros Development Project.
While complementing ongoing development projects, this project will be the
Government's initial effort at development of a relatively less prosperous
region of Greece through institutional reforms within the existing legal
framework for decentralization of decision making, coordination and monitor-
ing of public investments. The Government hopes that this project would pro-
vide a model for integrated investment in Greece. The main project objectives
are to: (a) improve the quality of life of beneficiaries about one-half of
whom are in the target group, (b) raise incomes and reduce regional income
disparities that currently characterize the Greek economy and that lead to
depopulation and disaffection and (c) test an organization capable of not
only implementing the project, but also monitoring its progress and preparing
further development programs.
1.02      Bank lending to Greece began in 1968 and to-date it has made 13
loans totalling US$339.9 million (net of cancellations), besides IFC invest-
ments totalling US$16.1 million in six companies. The Bank loans include
five loans (US$96.6 million) to the National Investment Bank for Industrial
Development (NIBID), three loans for education (US$82.3 million), three loans
for irrigation (US$95.0 million), one loan for highways (US$30.0 million) and
one loan for sewerage (US$36.0 million). The execution of Bank financed
projects has generally been satisfactory, although slow and subject to cost
overruns due to both domestic and international inflation. Bank lending
experience in education, irrigation and highways would be directly relevant
to the successful execution of the Evros Project.
1.03      This project was identified and prepared by Government officials and
the Bank staff assisted by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative program. Irrigation and
flood work, which involved possible riparian issues, were further studied by
consultants to ensure that the project would not adversely affect riparian
rights.
1.04      The project appraisal was completed in March 1977 by the mission
consisting of Messrs. M. Altaf Hussain, Masud Mian, D. Powrie, I. Porter,
Mrs. S. Fukuda-Parr (Bank Staff) and Messrs. W. Allan, J.C. Jones, and J.
Storms (Consultants). Messrs. B. Kanchanalach, G. Schumacher, and U. Kiermayr
also assisted in appraising respectively the hydrological, organizational and
financial aspects of the project.



II. COUNTRY BACKGROUND
2.01      General.  Greece has a population of about 9.1 million (mid-1976)
which is growing at 0.6% per annum; more than 30% of the population is concen-
trated in the Greater Athens area. The size of the rural population has been
falling both absolutely and relatively due to emigration which has recently
declined as a result of economic conditions in Europe. In 1976, GDP per
capita at current prices was approximately US$2,100 but this masks sectoral
and regional disparities. Real GDP during 1975 (at market prices) increased
by 5.6% compared with a decline of 2.7% during 1974 which was caused by the
Cyprus crisis. Agricultural growth at 3% during 1975 was about average for
recent years.
2.02      Agriculture.  The contribution of agriculture to total GDP has been
declining to less than 20% in 1976, but the sector remains important. It em-
ploys about 35% of the active working population, accounts for about 37% of
export earnings and provides raw materials for local manufacturing and pro-
cessing. At present about 3.9 million ha or 30% of the total 13.2 million ha
of Greece are devoted to farm land, 5.3 million ha to pasture and a further
3.0 million ha to forestry.
2.03      Through land reclamation, irrigation and subsidies, government
policy aims at the promotion of feedgrains, fodder crops, sugar beet and live-
stock production and of products such as fruit and vegetables which have good
processing and export possibilities. Progress has been hampered, however, by
small and fragmented farm holdings, the average land holding being 3.5 ha,
divided into 5 to 6 parcels. Land consolidation is a legal prerequisite for
public irrigation. The labor situation also poses a problem as emigration,
because of underemployment and low wages, causes labor shortages at peak times
of the year.
2.04      The Agricultural Bank of Greece (ABG) with nearly 200 branches
throughout Greece provides credit to 90% of farmers. The bank also provides
an extension service, which is supplementary to the Government's own extension
work. Agricultural cooperatives are responsible for supplying many of the
domestic and farm needs of rural families and also for the handling, process-
ing and sale of some farm produce.
2.05      Of all crops in Greece, sugar beet has shown the most rapid expan-
sion in recent years, as the country aims at self-sufficiency in sugar.
Greece has comparative advantage in terms of sugar beet yield which averages
55 tons/ha for Greece and exceeds 65 tons/ha on well-managed farms in Evros,
and processing season which exceeds 110 days compared with less than 90 days
in most European countries. Sugar production is in the hands of a public
corporation, the Hellenic Sugar Industry (HSI), and five factories are cur-
rently in operation. Self-sufficiency, aided by favorable weather and a crash
program, was reached for the first time in 1975, but an expansion in capacity
is still required to meet expected future increases in demand under normal
weather and campaign periods.



- 3 -
2.06      In forestry, the emphasis of Government policy is on import substi-
tution. Production of construction and industrial wood has been increasing
since 1950 but Greece still remains a net importer. In 1975, imports of
industrial wood, pulp and paper were valued at Dr 7.6 billion. To rectify
this situation, the forest road network is being expanded to exploit existing
inaccessible Government owned forests and new plantations are being estab-
lished.
2.07      In the future, structural changes in Greek agriculture can be ex-
pected if the country becomes a member of the European Economic Community
(EEC). Greece has been working towards this goal and support prices for
products such as cereals and sugar beet are close to Common Market levels.
2.08      Transport.  Due to the mountainous nature of the country and the
substantial proportion of people still living in small villages, highways
are the predominant mode of transport on the mainland. Overall, the extent
of the road network is adequate in relation to Greece's present state of
development but the physical condition of many provincial and rural roads
is poor and rehabilitation and upgrading are necessary.
2.09      Education and Social Infrastructure.  In general, the education
system is quantitatively well developed and primary education is universal.
However, the strong emphasis on classical education in the past has resulted
in relatively fewer resources being devoted to technical and vocational
education. As a result, the economy is finding it difficult to meet its
growing skilled manpower requirements. Further, the levels of education
vary sharply from region to region and in some of the rural areas illiteracy
is nearly twice the national average of 14%. Similarly, the degree of access
to social infrastructure varies from area to area with Greater Athens being
the best and Thrace (of which Evros is part) among the worst supplied.
2.10      Regional Development.  Most of the development of the Greek economy
has taken place in the Greater Athens area (and to a lesser extent in Salonica)
which have availability of finance, personnel, service industries, market and
other administrative facilities. Such a concentration of development has
resulted in an underutilization of resources in other parts of the country
and in social and economic problems for Athens itself. Regional disparities
in incomes and living standards have increased with per capita GDP in Athens
being about thrice that of Evros prefecture; the population has continued to
migrate to the urban centers; and the concentration of almost all new industry
in Athens or Salonica has prevented any significant resource development in
the rest of the country. At present a major obstacle to regional development
emerges from the centralized decision making in Athens.
2.11      To reduce emigration and improve income and its distribution, the
Government, besides currently practised price and income supports, establish-
ment of industrial estates and tax, tariff and interest incentives, is now em-
phasizing the need for decentralization of decision making and for coordinated
investment programs in the less prosperous regions. This would be reflected
in the next development plan now under preparation. A Regional Development



- 4 -
Service has been established whose major functions are administering the
incentives programs and requests for budgetary allocations. Its efforts are
now being directed to the major task of preparing integrated investment pro-
grams for these neglected areas. The emphasis of these programs would, among
other things, be on job creation for the young and for those returning from
abroad, on the setting up of satisfactory social infrastructure and on the
need to regionalize development according to the comparative advantage of each
area.
2.12      It is in this context of regional development that this small scale
project has been formulated. It aims at improving incomes in one of the
poorer areas with good resource potential and at encouraging people to remain
in the region. In addition to productive investments in agriculture, forestry
and industry (sugar factory), and improvements in the physical and social
infrastructure of the region an organization would be established to better
coordinate planning and investments. A fund would also be set up to facil-
itate the development of projects. The project fund (Chapter IV) and organiza-
tion (Chapter V) are intended to be replicated in other areas of Greece as a
model of regional development.
III. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Area Features
3.01      Location.  Evros is the most easterly of the three prefectures that
make up the region of Thrace. It covers 420,000 ha and lies in the extreme
northeast of Greece, bounded to the east by Turkey, to the north by Bulgaria
and to the south by the Aegean Sea (see Map).
3.02      Climate.  In the south of Evros, the climate can be classified as
eastern Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool to cold, moist winters.
In the north and west the climate is more continental with precipitation
frequently occurring as snow in the late autumn and winter. The mean annual
precipitation for the entire area of Evros amounts to about 690 mm but only
30% to 40% falls in the period from April to September, the six crucial
months for agriculture.
3.03      Topography and Soils.  The nomos is divided into two flat and gently
rolling plains by a large, central, mountainous range which reaches a height
of about 1,000 m. The northern plain around Orestias is crossed by the Ardas
and Erythropotamos rivers while in the south the Alexandroupolis coastal plain
merges with the Evros delta. The 3,000 ha proposed for irrigation under the
Bank financed project have deep, rich, well drained, alluvial soils. There
are no salinity problems and the land is suitable for irrigation.



B. Water Resources and Hydrology
3.04      The surface water resources of Evros are the river Evros and its
main tributaries, Ardas and Erythropotamos. The irrigation component of this
project would be located in the Erythropotamos valley. The Erythropotamos
has a catchment area of 1,560 km2, 40% being in Bulgaria and the remainder in
Greece. No hydrographs or regular records of the discharge measurements of
the river are available. Nevertheless, the available rainfall data of the
catchment area shows that the river runs substantial discharges during high
winter rains in its catchment whereas during the drier summer months of July-
September it runs low discharges. As a result, it inundates the fertile
cultivated lands of the valley in winter and does not carry surface supplies
for irrigation in summer. Investigations recently made by the Greek Govern-
ment have proven a substantial aquifer (350 Mm3) for supplying sustained
irrigation to about 3,000 hectares in the valley.
C. Population, Land Tenure and Farm Size
3.05      The population of Evros in 1961 was 158,000.  Many young people
migrated during 1960s either to the major towns within Greece or to western
Europe. Since 1971 emigration has slowed and the population has stabilized
at about 138,000.
3.06      Agricultural land is divided into about 29,000 holdings averaging
4.6 ha each and fragmented into 8 separate plots. Holdings are somewhat
larger than for Greece as a whole and are generally owner operated. Land
ownership is not excessively skewed as indicated in the table below:

D. Agriculture and Livestock
3.07      Agriculture and livestock are the main economic activities in the
nomos and about 70% of the population are still active in agriculture. Of
the total 420,000 ha in Evros, about 160,000 ha including community lands
or 38% are devoted to crops and a further 80,000 ha to pasture. Most of
the remainder is occupied by forests. Less than 10% is accounted for by
roads, rivers, residences and other uses.
3.08      The cropping pattern is oriented largely towards subsistence pro-
duction, food crops and supplementary feed for livestock, mainly alfalfa.
Production of maize and other summer crops is inhibited by the lack of irriga-
tion. Consequently, about 120,000 ha or 75% of the crop land is in winter
cereals and alfalfa. Industrial crops contribute little, except for sugar
beet recently introduced with the erection of the Orestias factory.
3.09      Under rainfed conditions yields are currently averaging 6 tons/ha
for alfalfa, 3.5 tons/ha for maize while inadequately irrigated sugar beet
averages 55 tons/ha. Improved seed varieties and better husbandry, aided by
extension and credit services, would result in increases in crop yields in the
whole nomos. Such increases would be substantial in areas to be irrigated
either by this project or by ongoing Government projects in Evros.
3.10      Livestock are also important in Evros which is generally regarded
as a meat producing area. Expansion of livestock production is inhibited,
however, by the low carrying capacity of the grazing land, lack of irrigation
for fodder crops, absence of young men for livestock care and small size of
holdings.
E. Irrigation
3.11      The present irrigated area of the nomos is about 16,000 ha consist-
ing mainly of public schemes and partly of small private wells. This area
is due to be increased to at least 40,000 ha by 1983 and to 50,000 ha if all
current plans are carried out in full. Major irrigation programs, current or
scheduled, include North and South Ardas, Neochorion, Orestias and, as part of
Bank financed project, the Erythropotamos valley. This expansion is important
for crop production and more so for the sugar industry because, at present,
irrigation limits sugar beet production.
F. Agricultural Credit, Extension and Research
3.12      The ABG handles almost all the credit requirements of farmers.  It
also channels subsidies to farmers and assists in the distribution of seeds,
fertilizers and chemicals. There are seven branches of the Bank in Evros, all



- 7 -
adeqpizely staffed and efficiently run. In 1976, 24,500 loans of Dr 940 mil-
lion were made. The Bank has no restrictions on the size of holdings and has
a 95% repayment record. Short-term, mainly production, loans are issued at an
interest rate of 7-1/2% per annum to individual farmers and 6-1/2% to coopera-
tives while medium and long term loans are issued at 6-1/2% to individuals and
6% to cooperatives.
3.13      The Directorate of Agriculture in Evros has four divisions respon-
sible for extension, data collection and planning, development of production
and finance. There are six branches of the extension service covering the
nomos and these are presently staffed by 26 field extension agents who are
all agricultural graduates. The service is adequate as regards numbers and
quality but the main limitations are the rapid turnover of personnel and
transport. Transport shortages also pose problems for the veterinary service
which protects not only Greece but the whole of Europe against the spread of
epizootics from the east.
3.14      Within the nomos, provision for agricultural research is inadequate
due to the lack of local facilities and the distance from the main institutes
and centers of research: the Fodder Crops Institute in Larissa and the Live-
stock, Industrial Crops and Cereals Institutes near Salonica. These insti-
tutes and the nearest research centers in Xanthi and Komotini do assist the
extension staff with experiments, mainly on farmers' lands, but the need for
a local field research station is strongly felt.
G. Forestry
3.15      The forest resources of Evros are substantial.  The fully forested
area covers 88,700 ha while the partially forested area, with good potential,
covers 56,000 ha. The potential yield from the fully forested areas is pre-
sently 94,000 m3, but many areas are inaccessible and current production is
only 75,000 m3. The most productive forest areas are the Derion/Dadia/Esime
area and the Dadia/Levkimi/Souffli area, covering 51,000 ha.
3.16      To increase and ensure sustained production, the Forestry Service is
engaged in reforestation in some of the bare and partially forested areas of
the nomos and also in building access roads into those areas already forested.
Harvesting of the wood is contracted to 15 Forest Workers' Cooperatives who
are currently underemployed. The Forest Service auctions the produce and
buyers are responsible for transportation.
H. Industry
3.17      Within the nomos the most important industry is the Orestias sugar
factory, which is now equipped with a slicing capacity of 3,000 TBD in a 100-
day campaign. Expansion of this capacity is dependent on an increase in ir-
rigation without which sugar beet cannot be grown. Other important industries



-8-
include a new meat complex at Ferrai, a milk plant in Alexandroupolis, a silk
mill at Souffli and various feed mills and cold stores.
3.18      Most manufacturing in Evros is carried out by small scale enter-
prises organized on a family or partnership basis. There are about 1,300
establishments providing employment to more than 3,000 persons. Only one
third of them employ 10 persons or more. Important among them are agricul-
tural implements, wood processing, engineering, electrical works and clothing.
Their expansion is constrained by limited access to capital.
I. Roads
3.19      The major centers of the nomos are adequately connected by paved
roads but subsidiary centers are presently dependent on gra-el or earth roads.
The condition of many of these roads is unsatisfactory and increasing traffic
loads require upgrading to bitumen standard. Improvements to the rural roads
would also be desirable for many are impassable during the winter and agricul-
tural operations are consequently hindered.
J. Market Places
3.20      Most fruit and vegetables are sold by farmers themselves at local
markets. Existing market places are traditional with minimal or no facilities
and are usually located on the main street causing congestion and hygiene
problems or trespass on waste land on the edge of communities. Improvements
are needed particularly in the larger towns where markets are held on a weekly
or more frequent basis.
K. Education and Social Infrastructure
3.21      The level of social services in Evros does not compare well with the
national average. Illiteracy is higher, health facilities are lower and less
than half of the houses have running water. The coverage of education has
improved in recent years but some schools use rented premises. In the health
sector, the problem has been aggravated by the poor quality of community water
supplies. Most communities are poorly served with recreational facilities and
municipal buildings. There are few community centers, even fewer libraries
and little other entertainment. Such sharp contrasts with the more developed
areas of Greece only encourage emigration.
L. Incomes and Levels of Living
3.22      There are wide income disparities between major urban centers and
elsewhere. Evros is typical of isolated predominantly agricultural areas.



- 9 -
Rural parts of the nomos account for 70% of its population which is about
twice the national average. The average rural per capita income is estimated
between US$750 and US$800 which compares to the national average agriculture
income (GAP) of US$980 but is only about a third of the overall national
average (GDP) of US$2,100. More than half of the rural population is esti-
mated to have incomes less than one-third of the national average. Farmers
in the Erythropotamos valley are poorer than in Evros as a whole but there is
little evidence of absolute poverty.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The Government has chosen to accelerate regional development to
raise incomes, reduce interregional income disparities, reduce emigration and
improve the quality of life. An initial small scale effort will be made in
Evros, which besides being one of the poorer areas, has a good agricultural
resource potential. To develop these resources, the Government is financing
projects costing Dr 1 billion (US$27.0 million equivalent) annually, in agri-
culture, irrigation, flood control, transport and education. This project
would complement the on-going interrelated components in different sectors
with a view to providing a model for integrated development in other areas of
Greece. To achieve this the project would provide, besides complementary in-
vestment funds, an organization capable not only of efficiently coordinating
the public investment program (including those not financed by the Bank) but
also of monitoring its progress, implementing the project and, through delega-
tion of financial authority, of producing new projects and programs for fi-
nancing by the private and public sectors.
B. Description
4.02      The project's complementary components would include:
(a) flood protection works on the Erythropotamos and
installation of about 75 tubewells;
(b) development of forestry;
(c) doubling the processing capacity of the Orestias
sugar factory;
(d) construction of paved connection roads and rural
roads, and supply of maintenance equipment;
(e) supply of vehicles and equipment for the extension,
research and veterinary services;



- 10 -
(f)  construction of a technical secondary school and pur-
chase of school equipment;
(g)  paving of community streets and improvement of drainage
and street lighting, construction of community centers,
construction of retail markets, and replacement of water
supply sources for 10 villages; and
(h) establishment of an Evros Special Development Fund to
finance feasibility studies and pilot projects.
C. Details of Project Components
4.03      Flood Protection (Annex 1).  Protection of 3,500 ha (gross) for
irrigation against a 50-year flood would be provided through the remodelling
of about 30 km of the central channels of the Erythropotamos river and its
tributaries and their confinement within levees. The levees would have a free
board of 1 meter above the water elevation reached in a 50 year flood. Drains
would be constructed in the protected area discharging into the river by
gravity during normal river flow and through pumping during high stage flow.
4.04      Irrigation (Annex 1).  About 3,000 ha (net) of irrigable land pro-
tected by flood works would be divided into 40-ha plots to be irrigated by
tubewell water distributed through cement asbestos pipes leading to hydrants
and mobile sprinkler systems in the field. Field roads, electric lines
and drains would also be constructed.
4.05      Forestry.  About 120 km of main access roads and about 165 km of
feeder roads would be constructed in two productive forest areas. Three per-
manent residences for forest workers would be built in the same area, and
three buses would be provided for transporting forest workers to logging
areas. Reforestation would also be carried out with 3,000 ha under three
varieties of pine. Agreement was reached during negotiations on the sched-
ule, location and design standards of the roads and the program of reforesta-
tion.
4.06      Sugar Factory.  The processing capacity of the Orestias sugar
factory would be extended from the present 3,000 TBD to 6,000 TBD to take
advantage of the excellent conditions for sugar beet production and process-
ing in Evros. This expansion would be part of the national plan to increase
the present capacity of 21,000 TBD to 29,000 TBD by 1982. The capacity of
Orestias factory would be increased to 4000 TBD with only minor modifications
and small additions of equipment. The subsequent expansion would be coor-
dinated with sugarbeet availability and completed by 1982. Government offi-
cials revealed that irrigation schemes, most of which are under construction,
would irrigate about 50,000 ha by 1984. The phasing of the factory expansion
is dependent on the progress of irrigation and assurances were, therefore,
obtained during negotiations that at least 40,000 ha in Evros will be irri-
gated by May 1983 (Annexes 2 and 8).



- 11 -
4.07      Connection and Rural Roads.  About 50 km of paved connection roads
would be constructed to link 13 villages to the existing paved road network
and about 250 km of gravel roads would be built in areas with good agricul-
tural potential. Road maintenance equipment would also be provided. Agree-
ment was reached during negotiations on the location and design standards of
the roads (Annex 1).
4.08      Extension and Veterinary Services.  Both the extension and the
veterinary services would be provided with additional transport to serve
the needs of the whole nomos, 8 vehicles going to extension and 11 to the
veterinary service. Field and laboratory equipment would be provided to the
field research station at Orestias and laboratory equipment would be supplied
to the Veterinary Research Center at Komotini (located out of the project
area) which serves the three prefectures of Thrace (Annexes 1 and 8). An
assurance was obtained during negotiations that these services will be
adequately equipped and staffed.
4.09      Technical Education (Annexes 1 and 8).  A technical lycee and voca-
tional secondary school would be constructed at Didimotichon and equipment
provided for this school and a similar school, designed for 900 students, now
under construction at Orestias. The gross area of the school at Didimotichon
would be 3,800 m2 and it would cater for 540 students. The Bank has suggested
changes in the curricula to meet the differing requirements of technicians and
craft training in a single institution in the morning and evening sessions.
The government accepted these in principle, but in-depth review is still in-
complete. An assurance was obtained during negotiations that suitable cur-
ricula for these schools would be adopted by March 31, 1978.
4.10      Social Infrastructure.  Community streets would be paved and drain-
age and lighting provided in 18 towns and villages. The total length of the
street paving would be about 55 km. Community centers would be constructed
in 12 towns and villages, the plinth area of the centers ranging from 380 m2
to 1,520 m2 depending on the size of the town. In 3 of the major towns of the
nomos, retail markets would be constructed and new water supply sources would
be developed for 10 villages, using either tubewells or springs, to replace
the existing wells which have been polluted by septic tanks. Agreement was
reached during negotiations on the location of proposed infrastructural facil-
ities (Annex 1).
4.11      Evros Special Development Fund (Fund).  A fund of about US$2.0 mil-
lion equivalent would be established by the Government by October 1, 1977, to
undertake studies and pilot projects such as on storing, grading and marketing
facilities, promoting small scale processing and manufacturing industry, and
developing pastures and forestry. The Government will contribute at least Dr
37 million (US$1 million) and the Bank loan the remaining US$1 million. The
Government would place its initial contribution of Dr 10 million (US$0.27 mil-
lion) in an account with the local branch of the Bank of Greece or any other
bank acceptable to the Bank. The drachma contribution by the Government would
be replenished every 6 months to bring the amount in the account to Dr 10 mil-
lion until the whole contribution of Dr 37 million has been made. The Bank



- 12 -
contribution would be paid into the same account through 50% reimbursement
against expenditure statements. This fund would finance studies and pilot
projects, including those in the private sector, aimed at advancing the devel-
opment of Evros. The cost of pilot projects leading to private investment
would be recovered from the beneficiaries. The Evros Regional Coordination
Committee (ERCC) will authorize studies costing up to US$200,000 each, without
reference to the Evros Central Coordination Committee (ECCC) but will inform
the ECCC and the Bank of such commitments. In cases where the cost of studies
exceed US$200,000 approval of both the ECCC and the Bank would be required.
All pilot projects will require approval of both the ECCC and the Bank. The
total cost of a pilot project will not exceed US$500,000 and its financing
arrangements would require Bank concurrence to be eligible for financing under
this Fund. The Fund will be operated by the Project Manager (PM). Applica-
tions for reimbursement would provide a description of the study or the pilot
project, its justification, cost and such other information as the Bank may
request. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that these arrangements
will be followed.
D. Water Requirements, Supply and Quality
4.12      Irrigation requirements would vary with crop, amount of rainfall,
temperature and wind velocity. The weighted average net crop irrigation
demand would be about 4,890 m3/ha or a total of 18.43 Mm3/year and the gross
project irrigation requirement allowing for losses would be 23.04 Mm3/year.
To supply this requirement, tubewells will withdraw from the alluvium under-
lying the project area and the aquifer will be recharged each winter. The
quantity and quality of the groundwater as determined by LRS through aquifer
tests and water analysis are adequate (Annex 3).
E. Water Rights-Riparian Issues
4.13      The proposed flood dikes of Erythropotamos and the groundwater ex-
traction for irrigating the protected lands (para 4.03) posed the following
riparian questions: (i) would the flood dikes have a detrimental erosion
effect on the Turkish bank of the Evros river or cause a backwater effect in
Bulgaria?; (ii) would the groundwater irrigation in Erythropotamos valley
adversely affect the Turkish riparian interests?; and (iii) is the project
technically protected from possible future extractions from Erythropotamos
river in Bulgaria?
4.14      After construction of dikes, the peak of a 50-year frequency flood
(design flood) in the Erythropotamos river would increase from its present
965 m3/sec to 1040 m3/sec at the end of dikes which terminate about 3.5 km
upstream of the confluence with the Evros river. The incremental velocities
would range between 2 cm/sec to 4 cm/sec depending on the stage of flow in
Evros river and would not change the regime of Evros river or increase erosion
of the Turkish bank. Nor would the flood stage of the Erythropotamos river



- 13 -
cause backwater effect in Bulgaria, because of higher elevation and the dikes
commencing some 4 km downstream from the border. Greece informed the Turkish
Government in November 1976 that it intended to construct the project, that
it was seeking Bank financing, and that the project was unlikely to have any
adverse effect on the Turkish bank of the Evros river. In March 1977, the
Bank sent further information to Turkey on this matter, asking for comments,
if any, by April 30, 1977. No comments were received from Turkey.
4.15      The impact of the project groundwater extraction upon the Evros
runoff would be insignificant. The total yearly extraction from the aquifer
would be about 23 Mm3 or 1.50 m3/sec for 6 months. Compared with the Evros
dry season flow of about 150 m3/sec the extraction would be negligible. The
total withdrawal would be less than 1% of the average annual runoff of 7,500
Mm3 of the Evros river.
4.16      Erythropotamos has two major tributaries upstream of project area.
One, draining about 40% of the catchment area, flows entirely in Bulgaria.
The other, draining about 30% of the river catchment area, mainly flows
through Greece, cuts across southeast corner of Bulgaria for about 5 km,
then runs along the border and back into Greece. The nature of terrain
through which it traverses in Bulgaria preempts diversion. Besides, before
this tributary enters Bulgaria it can be dammed by Greece at the Mikro
Derion dam site. The risk of Bulgarian diversion of their tributary is
therefore negligible. The Greek Government has informed Bulgaria of the
project on Brythropotamos during a meeting of the Joint Greek-Bulgarian
Commission on hydroeconomic matters in November 1976. Even if Bulgaria
diverts the water the Project would not be adversely affected as sufficient
recharge would be still available (Annex 4).
F. Status of Engineering
4.17      Preliminary designs based on 200 m apart cross sections of the flood
protection works have been prepared by Greek consultants (Th. GOFAS) in colla-
boration with SOGREAH engineers. Detailed designs are being made and are to
be completed by October 1977. The LRS has completed 14 trial boreholes and
assessed the physical works involved in their development. Planning of the
network of field roads and drains has begun and the design of these works and
the design and specifications of the sprinkler systems, for which adequate
local experience under Bank-financed irrigation projects is available, are
expected to be completed by January 1978.
4.18      Detailed engineering has been carried out by Ministry of Public
Works (MPW) consultants on the two connection roads where realignments are
necessary. On the other eight roads which only require upgrading, sample sec-
tion designs have been completed by the Ministry's own design offices and
quarry utilization plans have been drawn up for pavement materials. On the
rural roads, preliminary engineering has also been carried out by the LRS and,
on the forest roads, engineering is substantially complete on roads in one
area and preliminary engineering has been carried out on the other roads. For



- 14 -
the community streets, a relatively minor component, preliminary engineering
is being carried out by the MPW through the design offices in Evros of the
Technical Services Division of the nomos.
4.19      Technical studies and final list of equipment for the expansion of
the sugar factory have been completed by HSI, who will also prepare the
detailed designs assisted by 12 man-months of international consultants pro-
vided by the project under terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
Plinth area sketches of the community centers and retail markets have been
prepared by the Ministry of Coordination and the ABG while the Ministry of
Education is currently studying the laboratory and workshop requirements of
the technical schools.
G. Construction Schedule
4.20      Project construction would start in the fall of 1977 and be completed
by June 1982. The disbursement would be completed by December 1982. The con-
struction schedule is shown in Annex 5.
H. Cost Estimates
4.21      The project cost, based on December 1976 prices, is estimated to be
US$81.1 million, including physical and price contingencies, with a foreign
exchange component of US$35.0 million or about 43%. These estimates for civil
works are based on analysis of unit costs maintained and biannually updated
by the MPW at Alexandroupolis and on the actual construction of 14 trial
boreholes in the project irrigation area. Unit costs of equipment other than
that of sugar factory are based upon price quotations in Greece at the time
of appraisal. Sugar factory equipment and civil works were costed by an expe-
rienced consultant at preparation stage and reviewed and updated at appraisal
by another consultant from a specialized European firm of consultants. Phys-
ical contingencies are assessed at 5% of the cost of equipment and 10% of the
cost of civil works, which would be adequate because cost estimates reflect
local experience in similar works, major civil works have been adequately
prepared and the smaller ones would be mostly done on force account by depart-
ments with experience in such works. Price contingencies cater for annual
increases of 7.5% for years 1977-1979 and 7% for 1980-1982 on equipment costs,
and 9% for years 1977-1979 and 8% for 1980-1982 on the cost of works. The
cost estimates are summarized below and shown in detail on Annex 6.

I. Financing
4.22      The Bank loan of US$35.00 million equivalent or about 43% of the
total ($81.1 million) costs will finance the estimated project foreign ex-
change component. The Bank loan will be for 15 years including 3 years of
grace period. Estimated annual financial requirements are in Annex 7. The
financing plan would be as under:
Other Components  Sugar Factory (HSI)   Total /1
----------------------US$ m --------------------
IBRD                                21.0                14.0               35.0

/1   In addition, HSI would provide about US$7.0 million and the Government
about US$4.8 million interest and commitment charges during construc-
tion of which US$8.0 million would be for the Bank loan.
/2   Para 4.11.
4.23      In the case of the Orestias sugar factory, the financing arrange-
ments for US$26.8 million will involve the on-lending of US$14.00 million to
HSI out of loan funds at interest rate of not less than the current commercial
rates of 11% for a period not exceeding 12 years including a grace period of
3 years. These terms are comparable to those of private industrial borrowers
in Greece. This period is 2 years longer than the normal 10 years in Greece
and is required for reasonable debt service. The difference between 11% and
Bank's lending rate will be retained by the Government for guaranteeing the
loan and assuming the foreign exchange risk. A further US$5.5 million equiva-
lent would be provided by the ABG and ETVA to double the equity of IISI and the
remaining requirements would be financed through an ABG loan of $6.6 million
and HSI's own resources of $0.7 million during 1978-82. An assurance was
obtained during negotiations that these arrangemnts would be made, and the
ratification of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and HSI,
the subscription of the increase in share capital of HSI, and the finalization
of the loan agreement between HSI and ABG would be conditions of loan effec-
tiveness.
J. Procurement
4.24.     The procurement for the Orestias sugar factory would be done by HSI.
For all other civil works and for equipment items costing less than $20,000
each and up to a total of $1.0 million, the Nomarch will appoint ad-hoc local



- 17 -
committees for procurement. Equipment costing beyond this limit will be pro-
cured through the Ministry of Commerce. Civil works and equipment involving a
total cost of US$57.2 million would be procured through ICB, and small equip-
ment items costing less than US$20,000 each up to US$1.0 million and civil
works, which are spread over time and locations, costing US$8 million (Annex
9) would be procured following Government procurement procedures of local com-
petitive bidding which are satisfactory. In addition, a number of equipment
items for the sugar factory such as molasses tanks, silos, pans, hoppers, etc.
involving an aggregate cost of US$2.0 million equivalent, needed over 3 to 4
years, and to be tailored to the specific needs of the expansion program will
be fabricated in the existing underutilized HSI workshops. Items costing
less than $10,000 each and up to an aggregate of $250,000 will be procured by
HSI following its own procedures of local competitive bidding. Work relating
to forest and rural roads, and reforestation would be done on force account.
Lists of equipment are included in Annex 8. All equipment contracts would
allow local manufacturers a 15% preference margin or the applicable customs
duty, whichever is less. Specifications of pumping units and portable
sprinkler equipment would provide sufficient flexibility to permit a choice
between equally suitable alternative systems. The electric transmission lines
required for the project would be constructed by PPC through local contract or
their own task force. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
Government will follow these procurement procedures for Bank financed compo-
nents, and would cause the transmission lines to be constructed simultaneously
with the irrigation development schedule. An agreement was reached during
negotiations on the list of road equipment.
4.25      The specification and bidding documents of all the equipment exceed-
ing US$200,000 in value and the designs, specifications and bidding documents
of all the construction works exceeding US$500,000 would be cleared with the
Bank before tendering. The documents would be submitted by the project execu-
tion agencies, through the PM, except HSI who will send the documents to the
Bank under intimation to the Project Office. To ensure wide competition the
equipment and works be grouped as suggested in Annex 9. The Borrower will pre-
qualify bidders for sugar factory civil works following Bank Guidelines (para
1.3 and Annex 1 of the Guidelines). If the Borrower decides to prequalify
bidders for any other project related works, it would follow the same proce-
dures. An assurance was obtained during negotiations that the aforementioned
arrangements will be followed.
K. Disbursement
4.26      The Bank loan would be disbursed in 5 years as follows:
(i) 32% of the costs of civil works contracts awarded following
the Bank Guidelines for the flood control and irrigation
works, the forestry residences, the sugar factory, the
paved roads, and the community facilities;



- 18 -
(ii)  100% of foreign exchange cost of imported equipment and 90%
of ex-factory costs if locally purchased in accordance with
Bait procedures except (iii) below;
(iii)  50% of expenditure incurred against the Fund;
(iv)  100% of foreign exchange of consultants' services for the
design of expansion of the Orestias sugar factory.
4.27      If the electric transmission lines are erected under contract, dis-
bursement against the work would be on the basis of (i) above, but if under-
taken by PPC forces, disbursement would be made only for materials and
equipment under item (ii) above.
4.28      Savings, if any, at the completion of the project would be cancelled.
An estimated quarterly disbursement schedule is presented in Annex 10.
L. Accounts and Audit
4.29      The borrower would cause the departments and agencies responsible
for carrying out the project, to maintain separate accounts for each sub-
project, following current accounting and auditing procedures which are satis-
factory. An assurance was obtained during negotiations that the project ac-
counts maintained by TOEVs and the accounts of HSI would be audited annually
by independent auditors acceptable to the Government and the Bank, and that
the auditors' report would be sent to the Bank within six months after the
close of each fiscal year.
M. Environmental Effects
4.30      The project would have a beneficial effect on the environment of
Evros. Protection against floods and improvement of drainage would reduce the
damage to cultivable land and crops. Pine reforestation would help to prevent
soil erosion. Provision of social infrastructure in the form of paved streets,
community centers, markets and schools would all help to improve the social
environment for the population of Evros and encourage people to remain in the
area. Provision for replacing the polluted sources of water with clean water
would improve the health of the population.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
5.01      The multisectoral project composition would require an organization
that could function with speed, economy and above all, efficiency (Annex 11).



- 19 -
Several alternatives were considered by the Government of Greece and the Bank
missions. The one unanimously found most attractive was a three tier coordina-
tion and management system with a clearly defined delegation of administrative
and financial authority for which among other things, a fund of US$2.0 million
equivalent would be established. The alternative of creating a public corpora-
tion was not pursued because of project scale and non-revenue generating com-
ponents such as flood works, infrastructure and social provisions. The cor-
poration would also have required, what is time consuming, parliamentary ap-
proval. In addition, besides major reorganization in existing services, there
was danger of wasteful duplication of effort between the corporation and the
Government departments. The proposed organization would avoid these defects
and provide the desired efficiency, coordination and decentralization and would
monitor the project impact particularly on income improvement, emigration and
the effectiveness of the new organization and the Fund.
5.02      Evros Central Coordination Committee (ECCC).  The top tier would be
ECCC chaired by a general director of the Ministry of Coordination in Athens.
This Ministry has national responsibility for three functions that are critical
to the success of the regional Evros Project. These are (i) approval of the
.Public Investment budget, (ii) review of private investment under the new Re-
gional Development Incentives Law, and (iii) approval of all regional develop-
ment plans. 1/ The membership of this committee would include senior offi-
cials from inter alia the Ministries of Coordination, Agriculture, Public
Works, Interior and ABG. The Chief of the Ministry's Regional Development
Service would be its member-secretary. The staff of the Regional Development
Service would be strengthened to serve as its secretariat.
5.03      The main functions of the committee would be to:
(a) follow-up the project implementation and coordination of the
overall development program of the nomos;
(b) review the development program and the annual investment budget
proposals of the ERCC and make recommendations on them to the
Government;
(c) review and evaluate the results of the monitoring to be carried
out by the Evros Project Office (EPO) with respect to the effec-
tiveness of the new organization, the procurement procedures,
the Fund and its impact on income improvement and distribution
and on emigration; and review the annual project progress reports
for submission to the Bank; and
(d) review and approve proposed studies and pilot projects to be
financed out of the Fund that exceed the specified limits
(para 4.11).
1/   This function would be more important if Greece's EEC membership is
approved.



- 20 -
5.04      Evros Regional Coordination Committee (ERCC).  The second tier would
be ERCC at Alexandroupolis. The membership of the Committee would include,
inter alia, the PM, the chief of the Komotini office of the Regional Develop-
ment Service, the directors of the Evros Departments of Agriculture, Public
Works and Forestry, the Director of the Orestias sugar factory and a represen-
tative manager of the local branches of ABG. The head of the nomos, the
Nomarch, would be its chairman. The PM would be the member-secretary of the
committee. The directors of departments dealing with the development program
at the nomos level shall report on the progress of the program to the ERCC.
5.05      The functions of the ERCC would be to:
(a) implement the project (except the sugar factory);
(b) coordinate and review the development program for Evros
and the annual investment budget proposals of the dif-
ferent departments for all department schemes in the
nomos of Evros and make recommendations to the ECCC;
(c) supervise the implementation of the Evros development pro-
gram, and recruitment of staff, with incentives if necesary;
(d) advise the Nomarch on the composition and functions of the
local committees which will be appointed by the Nomarch on
an ad hoc basis for the purpose of (i) evaluating and award-
ing of civil works contracts under the project (except the
sugar factory), and (ii) evaluating and awarding of at least
the equipment contracts which are within the specified limits
(para 4.11);
(e) review the project progress including the Orestias sugar
factory and the public investment plans for the nomos of
Evros; and
(d) review and approve the studies and pilot projects to be fi-
nanced by the Fund to investigate private and public invest-
ment proposals with a view to advancing regional development.
5.06      Evros Project Office (EPO).  The third tier would be the Evros Proj-
ect Office headed by the PM. It would be adequately staffed and include at
least an economist, an engineer and an accountant. The PM and his staff would
be members of the Ministry of Coordination and functionally responsible to the
Nomarch. The PM would have relevant qualifications and experience and his
office would perform the following functions:
(a) with respect to the implementation of the project, to review
and revise the parts related to the implementation of the
project in the annual investment budget proposals of the
various technical departments in Evros; and



- 21 -
(b) with respect to the overall development program of Evros
(including the project): (i) to coordinate the preparation
of the Evros development program and the annual investment
budget proposals under the supervision of the ERCC, (ii)
to oversee, monitor, and coordinate the implementation of
the Evros development program by the development departments
in Evros, (iii) to provide secretariat services to the ERCC,
(iv) to initiate proposals for investigations, studies and
pilot projects, (v) to administer the Fund, and (vi) to col-
lect annually information required for the monitoring of the
project in accordance with criteria agreed between the Bor-
rower and the Bank, and to prepare annual Project progress
reports with the assistance of the different directors on
the project for submission to the ERCC, the ECCC and the Bank.
5.07      To ensure timely and effective functioning of the organization, an
assurance was obtained during negotiations that the EPO would be adequately
staffed at all times and PM would have qualifications acceptable to the Bank.
The establishment by the Government of the ECCC, ERCC and the EPO with the
membership and responsibilities as agreed between the Government and the Bank,
and the appointment of PM and at least two of his staff would be conditions of
loan effectiveness.
B. Sugar Industry
5.08      Organization.  HSI, with its headquarters at Salonica, is managed by
a Board of Directors under a president and a vice president. With the excep-
tion of the managing director, all are part-time. The Central Organization
consists of five departments - agricultural, technical, financial, commercial
and administration - each with a university graduate head and assistant head.
The agricultural department has some 50 agronomists and their assistants, the
technical department has 5 engineers, the finance department has 12 persons
and administration 20 - 25 staff. Each of the 5 existing factories has a man-
ager and administration, finance, agricultural, engineering and other support
staff. Each factory is charged with a proportion of central staff (Annex 2).
5.09      Both central and factory staff are well qualified, given training on
the job and promoted on merit. HSI has its own pay scales unrelated to, and
better than, those of the Government. The industry as a whole and the Orestias
factory as a unit, are well managed, and no basic organizational change is
foreseen except that the manager of the Orestias factory would be represented
on the ERCC to be established under the project. This would ensure liaison
and coordination between the factory and other local departments.
5.10      Financial Position.   HSI, a public corporation, has a share capital
of Dr 200 million held by two public sector banks, ABG (90%) and ETVA (10%),
which has remained unchanged since 1960. Rapid expansion of the Corporation's
activities over the past decade has been mainly financed by long-term loans
from 3 sources:  the Greek Government (Dr 710 million), ABG (Dr 2.05 billion),



- 22 -
and 3 suppliers' credits of Dr 680 million. Its outstanding long-term finan-
cial obligations currently stand at Dr 2.53 billion. The Government sugar
price policy allows HSI only a 6% profit margin on its net cost of production.
Therefore, accumulation of its retained earnings has been low compared to in-
vestment requirements, a cause for a weak equity capitalization. HSI's long-
term debt-equity ratio was 80:20 in 1973 and 74:26 in 1975. This high finan-
cial leverage resulted in a profitability of 32.2% on the share capital which
was counterbalanced by a tight debt service coverage: 1.2 times in 1973
rising to 1.7 times in 1975. HSI's liquidity was, however, satisfactory as
its current position did not drop below 1.5.
5.11      In the past HSI has financed its expansion with loans.  It would,
however, be financially unsound to continue financing its investments exclu-
sively with loan funds. HSI's management and the Government recognize this
situation and will increasc HSI's share capital b'! Dr 200 million during the
next five years (1978-82).
5.12      Financial projections for HSI and the Orestias plant, based on the
financing plan (Annex 2) indicate that HSI's debt equity ratio would be 70:30
in 1977 and 68:32 in 1982 and the current ratio will not drop below 1.7 during
project implementation when HSI will generate a cash flow sufficient to meet
its debt obligations. The debt service coverage would not go below 1.3 times.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that HSI will not incur any debt
unless a debt service coverage is maintained above 1.3, and that the dividend
policy of paying 10% on its share capital will not be increased during project
implementation.
5.13      HSI's overall financial position is tight, measured against commer-
cial standards. Its exposure to commercial risk requiring a better financial
protection is, however, practically nil as it is the sole producer of sugar in
Greece where sugar consumption is far below that of countries with comparable
incomes. An investment in HSI's expansion of up to 29,000 TBD by 1982 is,
therefore, financially sound. The expansion of the Orestias plant shows a
financial rate of return of 16%.
C. Operation and Maintenance
5.14      At the existing prefecture level the departments responsible for the
operation and maintenance of various public sector facilities include Public
Works, Land Reclamation, Forestry, Agricultural Extension, Veterinary, Health,
Education and Transport. Each of these departments is adequately staffed, and
is headed by an officer - usually titled Director. The departments belong to
different central ministries in Athens for technical and financial control.
Administratively, however, they have been reporting to the Nomarch and in the
future they would report to the ERCC. These departments would continue to
operate and maintain services for the project. Some of them, however, would
need additional equipment to cater for expanded project facilities. The
departments to be provided with such equipment include Public Works, which



- 23 -
would be responsible for flood protection works and services for construction
and maintenance of paved roads; LRS which is responsible for rural roads and
local farmers cooperatives, called TOEVs, 1/ which are responsible for irriga-
tion; Forestry Department for roads, reforestation and buildings; and Local
Services (Mayors) for buildings and other smaller structures. The sugar
factory at Orestias and Technical Schools, however, have sufficient facilities
for operation and maintenance. During negotiations assurances were obtained
that the Government would make satisfactory arrangements with various depart-
ments for the repair, replacement and renewal of all equipment and for the
maintenance of all project facilties.
D. Supporting Services
5.15      The Bank financed project is small in relation to the total develop-
ment activities current or foreseen in Evros. The present needs together with
those generated by the project would be met by existing services. Agricultural
extension, veterinary and research services and technical schools are adequate
in numbers and staff quality. Their current constraint of lack of equipment,
vehicles and buildings would be removed by the project. For sugarbeet produc-
tion, government extension services are supplemented by the 5 extension staff
of the Orestias factory backed by research agronomists at HSI headquarters.
In addition, the ABG has field agents for extension. Agricultural credit for
crop and livestock related activities is provided by the seven local branches
of the ABG and lending policies are satisfactory to meet the project needs
at the same terms as elsewhere in Greece. However small industry is impeded
for lack of easy access to credit (para 3.18). Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the Government would ensure, through provision of
refinancing facilities if necessary, that the incremental needs of the project
would be fully met.
E. Land Consolidation and Acquisition
5.16      Land holdings in the project area are small and fragmented.  Con-
solidation would be necessary for economy and efficiency in the irrigation
system. The existing government laws require consolidation of holdings in
all public irrigation schemes. The area requiring consolidation in this
project is only 3,000 ha out of a total of 40,000 to 50,000 ha to be irrig-
ated by 1984. Nevertheless, the Government plans provide for its consolida-
tion through the existing adequately staffed department, and, to ensure that
these plans would be carried into practice, an assurance was obtained during
1/   Major irrigation and drainage facilities serving more than one TOEV,
are operated and maintained by GOEVs, which would emerge when pro-
posed irrigation schemes in the nomos are completed.



- 24 -
negotiations that consolidation of 3,000 ha will be completed by May 1982.
An assurance was also obtained that land required for project works will be
acquired as and when needed.
F. Recovery of Project Costs
5.17      Cost recovery of each project component would be differently treated.
The Bank loan for the Orestias sugar plant, accounting for about one third of
the total project investment costs, will be on-lent to HSI at commercial in-
terest rates. Financial projections indicate that the Orestias sugar factory
under the preseL-'.- pricing system would generate sufficient funds to service
the loans for its expansion (Annex 2).
5.18      Forestry including roads, equipment and reforestation would consume
about 7% of total costs which would be fully recovered through auction of
public forest products within 15 years.
5.19      Irrigation would account for about 14% of total project costs.  Its
cost recovery would follow the formula which was agreed between Greece and
the Bank for the Nestos and Yannitsa Irrigation Project (Loan 991-GR). This
formula would permit the recovery of full Operations and Maintenance costs
and a small contribution towards depreciation (Annex 12). In current values
this would involve a charge of Dr 572 (US$16) per stremma and would result in
recovery of nearly 30% of project costs for irrigation in 40 years discounted
at 10%. This would represent 31% of the annual incremental farm income and
a rent recovery index of 43% (Annex 13). This is comparable to the 32% re-
covery of total cost under the East Vermion Project (Loan 1165-Gr) and higher
than the 23% for Nestos and Yannitsa Irrigation Project. Any higher charge
would reduce incentives to use irrigation and would be politically difficult
to impose. Moreover, some subsidy would be justified by the low median income
of the beneficiaries in the Erythropotamos valley which is about Dr 19,770
(US$540) per capita at present against the national per capita average income
of Dr 76,650 (US$2,100). Even at full development in 1984 the income of a
typical farmer would be Dr 32,140 (US$880), well below the current national
average income. Any lower level of recovery would be undesirable since the
total area to be irrigated by the early 1980s could be as much as 50,000 ha.
An assurance was obtained during negotiations that irrigation charges would
be collected by TOEVs annually, and paid into a central account. The charges
would be levied on a per stremma basis and would be sufficient to cover aggre-
gate costs of operating and maintaining the irrigation system including elec-
tricity and an additional amount equivalent to no less than 27% of such aggre-
gate costs representing a provision towards depreciation.
5.20      The drinking water supply component involves the replacement of
existing wells which have been polluted by septic tanks. Beneficiaries of
the existing water system pay a small water charge which is designed to cover
Operation and Maintenance costs. The same system of recovery would continue
as the project does not provide additional services and also because the in-
vestment in this component would not furnish sufficient leverage to apply a



- 25 -
water charge in a few villages that would differ from that in numerous other
villages in the area receiving similar water supplies. Market places would
be rented so that at least Operation and Maintenance costs are recovered as
is the present practice in Greece. An assurance was obtained during negotia-
tions that charges for potable water and rent/tax for market places would be
at least adequate to operate and maintain these facilities.
5.21      No direct recoveries are proposed for flood works, roads, technical
schools, community centers and paved streets as it is one of the objectives of
the project to improve incomes and the quality of life in this less prosperous
area where about half of the population is in the target group.
VI.  BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Production
6.01      The Bank financed project would result in increased production of
a variety of commodities (Annex 14). This would be enabled by irrigation,
supporting services (for the whole nomos), forestry exploitation, reforesta-
tion and extension of the sugar factory. This is summarized below.
6.02      Crop production would increase as follows:

6.03      The proposed extension of the sugar factory at Orestias would lead
to an annual incremental production of about 31,000 tons of white sugar repre-
senting about 10% of total present national sugar production. In addition,
the extension of this factory would enable production of sugar beet, which
is remunerative, in some 16,000 ha in a four-years rotation.
6.04      The provision of forest roads and other facilities would permit
the annual exploitation of an additional 17,000 m3 of various types of wood
products. The productive impact of pine reforestation would be more long-
term, reaching a maximum annual total of 94,000 m3 only after 40 years.



- 26 -
B. Market Prospects
6.05      Tihe increased production of sugar beet would supply the Orestias
factory. The expansion of the Orestias factory is part of the national pro-
gram of capacity expansion to maintain self-sufficiency, and the incremental
production of about 31,000 tons from Orestias would contribute to meeting the
increase in domestic demand which is estimated to reach 360,000 tons by 1982.
This would, assuming historical average campaign periods and sugar yields,
require an increase in the national sugar processing capacity from the present
21,000 TBD to 29,000 TBD by 1982 (Annex 2). The possible EEC membership, cur-
rently under negotiations, would have important implications for the Greek
sugar market as sugar production in the EEC is strictly controlled by a system
of quotas and intervention prices. If Greece does not obtain a quota equal to
its domestic consumption, any excess above the quota would have to be exported.
Although the Orestias factory's production costs are competitive with the Bank
EPD projected world market price, fluctuations around this price can be ex-
pected. However, Greece's membership and its terms and conditions are unknown
at present. While the risks are recognized, they do not invalidate the Gov-
ernment's policy to maintain self-sufficiency in sugar. To ensure project
implementation and to avoid overproduction, assurances were obtained during
negotiations that (a) the present 3,000 TBD capacity of the Orestias sugar
factory will be increased to 6,000 TBD by 1982, and (b) that total capacity
of Greek sugar factories will not exceed 29,000 TBD by 1982 unless justified
by market demand and discussed with the Bank.
6.06      No difficulties are anticipated in the disposal of other commodities,
part of which would be consumed within Evros. Increased production of maize
and of forest products would reduce imports, which in 1975 totaled 960,000
tons for maize and 526,000 m3 for wood. Forestry products would also supply
the existing and planned small-scale industries. Feed and fodder crops would
find ready marekts in the Islands which currently depend on imported supplies.
C. Prices
6.07      Prices of major commodities including those of wheat, barley and
sugarbeet, are set by the Government, while prices of fertilizers and some
chemicals, seeds and machinery are subsidized, fuel is taxed and labor is
guaranteed a minimum wage. Prices used in the financial evaluation are based
on local prices prevailing at the time of appraisal. For the economic anal-
ysis, projected world market prices for internationally traded goods were
adjusted to those provided by the Bank's Economic Analysis and Projections
Department. Prices of non-traded goods were based on financial prices, but
adjusted for taxes and subsidies. A shadow wage rate of Dr 19/hr was used
for off-season family farm labor and of Dr 75/hr for wood harvesting. For-
eign exchange was not shadow priced for want of data; however, sensitivity
tests were made on the basis of total costs (Annex 14).



- 27 -
6.08      The price of sugarbeet was derived from the projected world price
of sugar which was considered to be appropriate for economic analysis because
it reflects both the estimated marginal cost of production from new capacity
as well as the long-term average price. All prices used are shown in Annex 14.
D. Farmers' Incomes
6.09      A significant increase in incomes would result from the provision
of irrigation and flood protection works in the Erythropotamos Valley. The
Valley, together with the hillsides, make up the farmland of 12 villages,
and most farmers have both hillside and valley land. At present, net returns
from a typical I ha partial holding situated in the valley is estimated at
Dr 12,080 ($331). While this would increase in 1976 prices to Dr 16,780 ($460)
without the project, it would more than double to Dr 35,000 ($959) with the
project. The present ret farm income of a typical family operating a 4 ha
holding is estimated at Dr 79,070 ($2,170), rising to Dr 116,060 ($3,180) in
the future without the project and to Dr 128,565 ($3,520) at full development
with the project (Annex 13).
E. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
6.10      The economic rate of return on the project as a whole, including all
investment costs, would be 12%. This would increase to 16% if the costs of
components without quantified benefits are excluded. Sensitivity analyses
show that an increase in costs or decrease in benefits of any one component
would not be serious except for the sugar factory where a 15% increase in
costs or a 15% decrease in benefits would reduce the overall rate of return
to the whole project from 16% to 11%. Separate analysis for each component
showed the following results.
Sugar plant                                 15%
Flood control and irrigation                14%
Rural roads                                 33%
Connection roads                            22%
Forest roads, associated facilities
and pine reforestation                     14%
The risk presented by sensitivity tests on sugar component should be weighed
against the benefit of an assured supply at a stable price of a basic food
commodity.
6.11      While the rate of return analysis shows each of the separable in-
vestments to be viable, equal, if not greater, importance should be attached
to the impact of the project as a whole on the economy of Evros and its con-
tribution as an initial effort at regional development in Greece. These
proposed investments have been designed to complement the Government's special
programs of public investments and incentives to encourage private enterprise.



- 28 -
This total development effort would increase the level of economic activity.
Specifically, the Orestias sugar factory extension would complement the entire
public irrigation program and permit the agricultural potential of the region
to be exploited, providing an assured high income to the farmers from beet
cultivation. Forestry development would feed processing industries, many
of which are underutilized mainly for lack of raw material. Provision for
infrastructure would not only reduce the disparity in living standards between
Evros and elsewhere but would also serve productive activities. The project's
contribution to the regional development experiment in Greece would come not
only from the complementary nature of the investments, but from the introduc-
tion of reforms in the organization which have been designed to increase the
efficiency in utilization of funds. The replicability of such reforms would
be possible as the complementary investment would be only about $2,400 per
beneficiary family.
6.12      Almost all the people of Evros (34,500 families) would benefit
directly from this project, from major income-raising investments and/or from
social services provided. The largest benefits however would be felt by the
3,500 farm families in the Erythropotamos Valley, the 400 member families of
forestry cooperatives, more than 5,000 farm families that would be served
by rural roads and the construction workers who would find employment during
project implementation. About 1,000 workers in existing small sawmills and
about 5,000 beet farmers in addition to those in the Erythropotamos Valley
would improve their incomes.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached and assurances were
obtained on the principal issues referred to in Chapters 4, 5 and 6. Subject
to the conditions of loan effectiveness concerning the finalization of the
financing arrangements for the Orestias sugar factory expansion (para 4.23)
and the establishment of the project organization including the appointment
of the PM (para 5.07), the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$35.0
million for 15 years including a grace period of 3 years. The Borrower would
be the Hellenic State.



ANNEX 1
Page 1
APPRAISAL OF
EVROS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
GREECE
Project Description
A. General
1.        The Greek Government has chosen to accelerate its efforts at regional
development by formulating and implementing a coordinated investment program
in the nomos of Evros. Evros was chosen as a suitable area for this initial
program because it is not only one of the poorer areas of Greece but also an
area of considerable agricultural potential.
2.        In formulating the program the resource base of the nomos has
been studied, the agricultural and industrial development possibilities have
been assessed and an attempt has been made to determine the major structural
bottlenecks to future growth. The program is designed both to increase
incomes throughout the nomos and also provide the necessary facilities and
improvements in the quality of life which will encourage people to remain in
the region. Particular attention has been paid to the institutional question
and an organization is to be established in Evros which should enhance the
decentralization of decision making and ensure that the program is imple-
mented satisfactorily.
3.        The program is designed as the first of a series to reduce regional
income disparities within Greece. The actual components of the program are
unique to Evros, based on the specific resources and needs of the nomos; but
the process of establishing the resource base, identifying the infrastructure
needs and the setting up of appropriate institutions are all exercises that
can be replicated in other less developed areas of the country. The desire
for replicability has also meant that close attention has been paid to the
cost per beneficiary of the program.
4.        The present project is only part of the Evros development effort
and is designed to complement the Government's own investments which at
present are running at an annual total of about Dr 1,000 million (US$27
million) or Dr 7,250 per capita, nearly three times the national average
(Dr 2,500). The project does, however, affect the whole population of
Evros and particularly the 70% who live in rural areas where median incomes
are less than one-third of the national average.



ANNEX I

B. Project Works
Flood Protection and Irrigation
5.   (a)  Remodelling of the central channel of the Erythropotamos
river and its confinement within levees to protect about
3,500 ha (gross) of the valley lands from floods.
(b) Reshaping the central channels of the tributaries of the
Erythropotamos river and confining them within levees to
prevent them from spilling into the protected area.
(c) Land consolidation and farm improvement works in the
protected area.
(d) Installation of 75 tubewells and sprinkler system to
irrigate about 3,000 ha net in the protected area.
6.        The central channel of the Erythropotamos river would be remodelled
to contain the annually recurring floods within its banks. It would be
bounded by about 50 to 60 meter-wide berms on either side contained within
levees or the high river banks. The levees would have a free board of 1.0
meter above the water elevations attained with a fifty year frequency flood
flowing in the river.  The existing slope of the river channel would be re-
tained as far as possible and its width and depth increased to meet the above
stated criteria. Apart from the main river channel, the river tributaries
joining the river between Metaxades and Didimotichon bridges in the irrigation
project area would also be remodelled to contain 50-year frequency floods.
Drains would be constructed in the protected area, discharging into the river
by gravity during normal river flows and through pumping during high stage
flows.
7.        Land consolidation, which is required by law in the reclaimed areas,
would be done by LRS staff. Field roads and field drains would be constructed
for proper access to and drainage of the farm areas. The project area would
be divided into 40-hectare plots and each plot would be irrigated by tubewell
water through buried cement asbestos pipes leading to hydrants and mobile
sprinkler systems.
8.        This program of flood control and irrigation would directly af-
fect the incomes and living standards of the 3,500 rural families in the



ANNEX 1
Page 3
Erythropotamos Valley, most of whom have per capita incomes less than one
third of the national average. 1/
Forestry
9.   (a)  Construction of 285 km of forest roads in the Derion/Dadia/
Esime (DDE) and Dadia/Lefkimi/Souffli (DLS) areas.
(b) Purchase of road equipment to assist in the construction
of forest roads in these areas.
(c) Construction of 3 residences for forest workers and purchase
of 3 buses.
(d) Planting of 390 ha of Pinus radiata, 980 ha of Pinus maritima
and 1,630 ha of Pinus nigra in the Kirki/Sykorrachi, Drymos/
Esime and Derion/Dadia plantation areas.
(e) Purchase of equipment to assist in the reforestation opera-
tions in these areas.
10.       Construction of the forest roads, details below, would increase the
present road densities of 10.7 m/ha in the DDE area and 8.7 m/ha in the DLS
area to 16.5 m/ha and 14.2 m/ha respectively thereby enabling full exploita-
tion of these forest areas.
1/   All data on population in this Annex is taken from the 1971 population
census and is a reasonable estimate of the present population.

depending upon the size of the area and the through service provided by the
road. Feeder roads lead off both A and B roads into logging areas. Details
of the design standards, which are satisfactory, are given below:

12.       To increase the productivity of forest workers, the construction of
three permanent residences and the purchase of three buses are also included
in the project. The permanent structures would be built in the middle of the
DDE/DLS forest complex and would be used by forest workers logging in nearby
areas. The buses would be based at Esime, Dadia and Souffli and would be used
for transporting forest workers to outlying logging areas.
13.       Pine reforestation is proposed for three plantation areas located in
mountainous countryside in the center and south of the nomos. Plantation work
has already been carried out in all three areas and the proposed reforestation
program is merely a continuation of past operations. In each area, the work
would consist of shrub removal, cross ripping, ploughing, seedling production,
planting and maintenance one year after planting. Details of the proposed
hectarage are provided below.

14.       The forestry component would directly affect the personnel of
forestry service and the ten forest cooperatives in the area with 400 regis-
tered members, 40% of whom are currently inactive due to lack of sufficient
work. In addition, the program would have a significant effect on the wood
processing industry in Evros and the 1,000 workers in this industry many of
whom work in the more than 100 small sawmills that are presently operating at
only 12% of installed capacity. Some of these industries are located in or
near Alexandroupolis, but many others are in the small mountainous villages
where conditions of living are very difficult.



ANNEX 1

Sugar Facti:--r
15. (a) Extension of the processing capacity of the Orestias sugar factory
from 3,000 TBD to 6,000 TBD.
16.       A detailed description of the proposed extension is contained in
Annex 2. No additional employment in the factory is expected as a result
of the expansion but the project would directly affect some 8,000 farms that
would supply the additional beet. About 3,500 of these farms are located in
the Erythropotamos Valley.
Connection Roads and Paved Road Maintenance
17.  (a)  Construction of 50 km of paved connection roads to villages
in Evros.
(b) Purchase of road maintenance equipment to carry out routine
maintenance of all paved roads in Evros except those for
which equipment is provided under the national road main-
tenance program.
18.       The connection roads component of the project consists of the con-
struction of ten paved accesses linking 13 villages to the existing paved road
network.  One of the roads also connects four villages to each other and pro-
vides a through route from Orestias up the broad ridge of agricultural land
between the Ardas and Erythropotamos rivers. The villages are at present
served with gravel-surfaced access roads, generally on satisfactory alignments,
and in such cases the construction work covers only the paving of the existing
alignments and improvement of drainage. On the Sterna-Kavili and Valtos-
Chandra roads, realignment is also included in the construction works, and
right-of-way acquisition would be carried out by the Government in advance
of construction. The paved width on all the access roads would be 6 m. The
details of the roads are tabulated below:

20.       Construction of these roads would help to improve communications
for the 9,000 people living in the various villages served.
Rural Roads
21.  (a)  Construction of 253 km of rural roads in 25 locations
throughout Evros.
(b) Purchase of road equipment to assist in the construction
and maintenance of rural roads.
22.       The proposed roads supplement the existing network in-Evros which
include 215 km of rural roads already built by the Land Reclamation Service.
Twenty-five areas have been selected where agriculture can be advanced if
roads are constructed. From one to five contiguous rural roads are proposed
for each area to give an overall density of 12.4 m/ha. Agricultural traffic
would be operated by private farmers and cooperatives.
23.       The standards for rural roads allow for 2 types, major and minor
roads, which have 5 m and 4 m wide gravelled surfaces.  The selection of
road type is based upon the expected use of the road. In the 25 areas to
be served with rural roads, 152 km of major and 101 km of minor roads are
proposed (IBRD Map 12749) as tabulated below:

25.       Construction of these roads would help to reduce transport costs and
increase the production of wheat, barley, maize and alfalfa by ensuring that
fertilizer and other inputs are applied at the optimum time and that harvesting
can be carried out satisfactorily. More than 5,000 farms would be directly
affected.



ANNEX 1

Equipment for Extension and Research
26.  (a)  Purchase of eight vehicles for the extension service.
(b) Purchase of field equipment, laboratory equipment and
vehicles for the research farm at Orestias.
27.       One vehicle would be provided to each of the eight centers and sub-
centers which would alleviate the present transport constraint. The field and
laboratory equipment and the other vehicles would be used by the Orestias farm
which is due to be converted from its present status as a "prototype" farm
serving little useful purpose to a field research station. Both components
should make a substantial contribution to development and in time affect most
of the rural population.
Equipment for Veterinary Service
28. (a) Purchase of 11 vehicles for the veterinary service.
(b) Purchase of equipment for the veterinary diagnostic laboratory.
29.       At present the service suffers from a shortage of transport (which
limits the effectiveness of inoculation campaigns against foot and mouth
disease) and also has inadequate facilities for accurate and rapid diagnosis.
Such constraints are particularly serious as Evros forms part of the defense
barrier that protects not only Greece but the whole of Europe against the
spread of epizootics from the east, in particular the Asiatic and other forms
of foot and mouth disease. Provision of additional transport and laboratory
equipment would relieve these constraints and help to save livestock.
Technical Education
30   (a)  Construction of a technical lycee (3-year course after 9
years schooling) and vocational (2-year course after 18
years schooling) secondary school at Didimotichon and
purchase of equipment for the school.
(b) Purchase of equipment for a similar school now under
construction at Orestias.
31.       At present both schools are operating a restricted program in
temporary accommodation. The provision of equipment and the construction
of a new school at Didimotichon would ease these restrictions and enable
the schools to offer instruction at technician and craft levels (the schools
would operate as technical lycees from 8.00 a.m. to 2.00 p.m. and as voca-
tional secondary schools from 2.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.). Projected enroll-
ments at the two schools have been adjusted to give maximum efficiency in
the usage of workshops and equipment and are detailed below.

32.       The gross area of the school at Didimotichon would be 3,802 m2
(Table 1) and the gross area of the school at Orestias 5,759 m2. Suitable
sites for the two schools have already been selected, service facilities are
available and construction of the school at Orestias has already begun. The
schools would serve not only the 9,000 people of Didimotichon and the 12,500
people of Orestias but also neighboring villages.  Graduates of the three-year
courses are likely to enter industry or commerce at middle-technician level,
with a few going to higher technical or commercial institutes (KATE's).
Graduates of the two-year courses would rise to positions at lower supervisory
level.
Community Streets
33.       Paving of community streets in 18 towns and villages throughout
the nomos and improvement of drainage and street lighting.
34.       The towns and villages and individual streets were selected by
the Ministry of Public Works on the basis of community size, traffic volumes,
improved street standards and the effect these have upon users and nearby
residents. The existing roadways are generally of uneven stone or gravel
surface with very poor drainage and no street lighting. Details of the
proposed roads are provided below.

40.       The new markets would replace the present street markets and make
for a better presentation and conservation of fruit and vegetables and avoid
congestion of traffic and pedestrians. They should benefit not only the
farmers and other retailers but also the consumers. Blueprints have been
prepared for all three markets and sites have been reserved.
Water Supplies
41.       Developing new water supply sources to replace the polluted water
supplies of ten villages.

42.       In general, the work would consist of construction of tubewells or
development of springs, construction of pump houses, provision of pumping
equipment and electrification and the laying of water pipes. In all the
villages and towns, present sources of water are polluted and development of
new sources would lead to improvements in the health of the whole population.
Project Establishment/Evros Special Development Fund
43.  (a)  Establishment of a three-tier coordination and management
system for the project, including the provision of per-
sonnel, furniture, equipment and three vehicles for the
Project Office.
(b) Creation of a fund to finance further investigations,
feasibility studies and pilot projects in Evros.
44.       To oversee the implementation of the Evros Development Project and
also to monitor its progress, a three-tier organization would be established
consisting of a Central Coordination Committee in Athens, a Regional Coordina-
tion Committee in Alexandroupolis and a Project Office based also in Alex-
androupolis. Details of the proposed organization are provided in Chapter V.
The organization would be charged not merely with implementing the present
project but also with assessing further the resource potential of the area,
coordinating the preparation of the regional development plan and producing
new development projects. A fund would be established to finance feasibility
studies and other investigations of possible investments in both the private
and public sectors.

APPRAISAL OF
EVROS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
GREECE
The Sugar Industry
A. General
1.        The policy of the Greek Government is to maintain self-sufficiency
in sugar, a basic necessity. To implement this policy the Hellenic Sugar
Industry (HSI) was established in 1960 to process the entire sugar beet crop
and to organize the cultivation of sugar beet by small holder farmers in
cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture (para 18).
2.        Production.  Sugar production began in 1961 with the establishment
of the first factory. Since then, four more plants have been added and the
total installed capacity today is about 21,000 TBD. Sugar production per unit
of installed capacity has varied from year to year due largely to variations
in sucrose content and yield of beet. On average, the recovery rate has been
11.5% and the duration of the campaign 113 days. Thus, production from the
present installed capacity would be 273,000 tons white sugar under normal
conditions. However, 330,000 tons were produced in 1976 due to a campaign
lasting 153 days. The recovery rate was 10.8%, longer harvesting season
resulting in beet of lower sugar content.
3.        Greece reached self-sufficiency in 1975.  Although the surplus pro-
duction from 1976 would have to be exported, this is a result of abnormal
production conditions and capacity expansion would still be required to meet
future increases in domestic demand estimated to reach 360,000 tons by 1982.
This would require a capacity of 29,000 TBD, assuming a recovery rate of 11.5%
and a campaign of 110 days. The average length of the campaign is expected to
be lower than in the past with the expansion of the factory at Orestias where
the climate curtails the harvesting period to 100 days and with the older
factories requiring increased maintenance. Table 1 shows details of the
growth of production.
4.        Consumption.  Sugar consumption more than doubled in the last decade,
growing at an annual rate of over 6%. In 1976 it was 260,000 tons (white
sugar) or 28.5 kg per capita. Most of the increase has been due to a tripling
in industrial demand which now represents about 60% of total consumption. HSI
anticipates these general trends to continue in the coming years. Assuming a
5% annual growth rate, consumption would reach about 360,000 tons (or 38.3 kg
per capita) by 1982. Based on a regression of per capita consumption on per
capita GDP, consumption in 1982 would be 39.2 kg per capita, or 368,900 tons
(Table 2).



ANNEX 2
Page 2
5.        These projections, which assume past trends to continue, would not
be unrealistic when one considers that per capita consumption is still at a
level where significant increases could be expected. In absolute terms it
is well below the "saturation" level reached in most developed countries of
40-60 kg per capita. Compared to countries with similar incomes, Greek con-
sumption both at present and projected levels would be relatively low as shown
below:

6.        Organization.  While HSI is an autonomous corporation it is owned
by public banks and is subject to state influence in matters of policy such
as pricing of sugar and sugar beets, levels of capacity expansion, etc.
The Ministry of Coordination is represented on the Board of Directors. In
all other respects, HSI is organized as an autonomous profit-making corpora-
tion. The appraisal mission was satisfied with the managerial efficiency of
the corporation and with the operational efficiency of the Orestias factory
(paras 5.08, 5.09 and 16).
7.        Financial Position.  A summary of HSI's historical financial data
is shown in the table below:

HSI's share capital which is held by two public sector financial institutions,
ABG (90%) and ETVA (10%), has remained unchanged at Dr 200 million since its
inception in 1960. The sugar industry's rapid expansion has been mainly
financed by long-term loans which were provided by three sources. Between
1960 and 1964 the Greek Government made six loans totaling Dr 710 million.
These loans were made at 4% interest and have maturities of 19 years includ-
ing 4 years of grace. ABG between 1969 and 1975 provided 8 loans totaling
Dr 2.05 billion. Interest on ABG's loans have recently been raised to 6%.
Maturities of these loans vary from 9 to 18 years, with grace periods ranging
from 4 to 8 years. Three suppliers of equipment from Poland and the CSSR
have arranged financing at 7% and 6% for 7 and 4 years, respectively. For
these three loans totaling US$18.7 million HSI carries the foreign exchange
risk. HSI's outstanding long-term financial obligations presently stand at
Dr 2.53 billion.

Given the i      ial restrictions under which HSI has to operate as a public
sector enterprise the financial projections are satisfactory. HSI has access
to sufficient short-term capital to finance an increased level of receivables
and inventories. Its current position will vary around a satisfactory 1.7
during project implementation. Debt service coverage would not drop below
1.4 for HSI as a whole and would remain above 1.18 for the Orestias plant.
Because of HSI's slow generation of retained earnings, an assurance was ob-
tained during negotiations that as a dividend policy a ceiling of 10% would
be set for the period of project implementation. On this assumption, HSI's
pay out ratio will increase from presently 9% to 13% in 1982.
8.        Because of the government regulated sugar price policy which allows
HSI only a 6% profit margin on its net cost of production, HSI's accumulation
of retained earnings was slow compared to its investment requirements. HSI's
capitalization is characterized by a weak equity position; its long-term debt/
equity ratio stood at 80:20 in 1973 from which it has improved to 74:26 in
1975. Part of HSI's working capital was financed out of its long-term borrow-
ing, resulting in high current ratios in 1972 and 1973. This situation was
reversed during 1974 and 1975 when its current position dropped to 2 and 1.5
respectively. HSI's high financial leverage has led to increasing profit-
ability which reached 32% in 1975. On the other hand HSI's debt service
coverage was tight. Based on its annual cash flow, the debt service ratio
stood at 1.2 in 1973, but has improved to 1.7 in 1975. For the last few
years HSI has paid a 10% cash dividend. HSI's accounts are audited by the
Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Greece, ICPAG, which is satis-
factory to the Bank.
9.        In the past HSI has not encountered any difficulties in securing
long-term loans from government-owned banks and suppliers whose loans were
guaranteed by the Government. Taking into consideration HSI's slow internal
equity accumulation, it would, however, be financially unsound to further
expand its capacity without an increase in its share capital. HSI's manage-
ment and the Government have realized this situation, and during appraisal
it was agreed that HSI's share capital would be increased by 100%. Payments
in that respect would be spread over five years and the proceeds would be
used together with a loan from ABG to finance the local cost part of the
Orestias expansion.
10.       Financial projections for HSI and the Orestias plant reflecting
the expansion program are shown in Tables 4 to 9. A summary of HSI's pro-
jected financial data is shown in the table below:
11.       Costs of Production.  HSI's average cost of production for 1975 was

The price of beet is set by the Ministry of Agriculture. The 1976 price was
Dr 1,180 per ton for 16% sucrose content adjusted by quality of beet, ranging
from Dr 550 (10% sucrose) to Dr 1,580 (20% sucrose). This compares with the
EEC support price of approximately Dr 1,030 (22.75 U.C.) for 16% sucrose
content. Considering that production is from relatively recent capital
investment, this cost level compares favorably with the long-term interna-
tional average marginal cost of production from new capacity, estimated at
20-22 J per lb. (14.9 J raw value). 1/ Present costs of production in the US
are estimated to be about 19 i per lb., while in the EEC the average ex-factory
price was 18.9 0 in 1976 and the minimum price of imported sugar is set at
20 i per lb. However, costs of production in more efficient developing ex-
porting countries can be much lower. 2/
12.       Pricing Policy.  The Ministry of Commerce sets the official ex-
factory wholesale price of sugar and HSI is entitled to sell at a price which
is defined as the operating costs plus 6% profit plus interest plus statutory
depreciation of 8% on buildings and 15% on equipment. In 1976 the official
wholesale price was Dr 18.2, while HSI's selling price was 15.7 Dr per kg.
The retail price is controlled by limiting profits to the wholesaler and the
retailer and was about Dr 22.4 per kg (28 J per lb) in 1976. Thus in Greece
sugar is effectively taxed in contrast to many countries where sugar is

subsidized. The retail price is correspondingly high, at about 28 i per lb.
in 1976 compared to 24 d per lb. in USA. 1/
13.       Marketing and Distribution Channels.  The responsibility for market-
ing and distribution of sugar was in the hands of the Ministry of Commerce
until March 1, 1977 when it was transferred to HSI. The arrangements for stor-
age of sugar at HSI plants and the pricing system have not changed. Sales
would be on cash-and-carry terms with financial arrangements made through the
ABG. However, the Ministry of Commerce would retain the responsibility for
exports which might occasionally be necessary in years of exceptionally good
weather conditions.
14.       EEC Membership.  Within the scope of negotiations for Greece's
membership in the EEC, formal discussions on sugar began in November 1976.
Sugar, being a proxy for beet and cane, is subject to the Common Agricultural
Policy (CAP) of the EEC and is one of the most strictly controlled commodi-
ties. Each member state is allocated a quota of sugar which can be sold on the
common market at the target price of 3.49 U.C. per kg or Dr 15.8 in 1976. In
addition, a percentage (45% for 1975/76) of the basic quota can be sold in the
common market at the same price, but this is subject to levy of not more than
30% to finance the support price. Production above this maximum quota (145%
basic quota) must be exported.
15.       The terms of Greek membership are unknown at present.  However, the
objectives of the Government are consistent with the present policies of the
EEC to maintain self-sufficiency and to protect the interest of beet growers,
although this is subject to change. The Government is confident that they
would obtain a quota which would cover their domestic consumption at the time
of its entry. Both financial and economic analysis considered these implica-
tions (para 22 and Annex 14).
16.       Within the EEC, Greece would not be an inefficient sugar producer,
the beet yield being significantly higher, at 55 tons (with sucrose content
of 14.6%) ha compared to the EEC average of 42 tons (with sucrose content of
16.2%) per ha. The ex-factory price of sugar is comparable to the EEC average,
although the latter is from older factories.
B. Extension of the Orestias Plant
17.       The Existing Plant.  The Orestias plant is a straight 3-bailings
sugar factory of 3000 TBD capacity producing white sugar, molasses and pelleted
dried pulp using a conventional European processing technology. It was con-
structed under a turn-key contract with Polimex-Cekop Ltd. Poland. Installa-
tion was completed in October 1975, and operation trials were carried out for
a period of 33 days of actual beet slicing. The guarantee test-runs were suc-
cessfully carried out in 1976 during the first full campaign. The results of
the first campaign were exceptionally good with a recovery rate of 13.7% sugar.
1/   USDA, Sugar and Sweetener Report Vol. 2, No., February 1977.



ANNEX 2
Page 7
For the future, the average recovery rate is expected to be 13%, and the
operating capacity could reach 3,600 TBD without additional investment and
without significant increase in maintenance costs. The duration of the cam-
paign would be limited to 100 days by the cold climate which restricts the
harvesting period and output of sugar at about 46,800 tons.
18.       Organization.  Orestias plant's organization is standard for HSI
and there are four departments directly responsible to the Manager: produc-
tion, maintenance, agriculture and administration. There is also a laboratory
which is part of the Manager's office. Contacts are held daily with the Head
Office in Salonica. Purchase service is concentrated in the Head Office
where a permanent inventory is held, which has, among others, the advantage
of reducing the stock of spare parts. The efficient operation and team
work of the Orestias staff are evident from the high standard of cleanliness
and order, the effective delegation of authority, a staff conscious of its
responsibility for operation and development of the factory, and the free flow
of information. The staffing is, if anything, more than adequate and includes
16 university graduates.
19.       The Extension.  Technical studies for the proposed extension to
6000 TBD nominal capacity were carried out by the services of the HSI. Final
designs will be made with the assistance of international consultants. The
detailed list of equipment and cost estimates were reviewed and found satis-
factory. The proposed extension would be carried out in two phases. In the
first phase, capacity would be extended to 4,000 TBD. This would only require
an addition of minor equipment and modifications and can be carried out in
1979. The second phase of the extension to 6000 TBD would be implemented over
the next two years, the major work being carried out during the first year.
The yearly progress of capacity expansion and corresponding production levels
would be:
Year     Capacity      Total Production      Incremental Production
(TBD)          (tons sugar)             (tons sugar)
1979       4000             52,000                    5,200
1980       4400             57,200                   10,400
1981       5600             72,800                   26,000
1982       6000             78,000                   31,200
Details of equipment lists and construction schedules are shown in Annex 1 and
Annex 5. Although this is a Polish-built factory, the processing technology
used is of a Danish patent and a number of countries would be able to supply
the equipment required for the extension under ICB procedures.
20.       Supply of Beet.  Sugar beet is supplied by small holder farmers who
contract to cultivate a given area of beet and to follow certain agricultural
practices. The agricultural services of the factory, which include six agro-
nomists, implement the mandatory 4-year rotation, carry out some of the pest
control, and, with the cooperation of the ABG, ensure that the farmers are
supplied with all inputs including credit. The price of sugar beet is highly



ANNEX 2
Page 8
competitive with other crops in general, and throughout Northern Greece the
demand for HSI contracts by farmers has far exceeded the requirement of the
factories. Sugar beet also has the added attraction of an assured market at
a predetermined price. In Evros, as there are almost no alternative activi-
ties with high returns, almost all the irrigated land would be put under a
4-year beet rotation. The Orestias factory would require 40,000 ha of irri-
gated land to operate at 6,000 TBD. While only 16,000 ha are presently irri-
gated, there are a number of public and private irrigation schemes under con-
struction and at least 40,000 ha would be irrigated in Evros by 1982 (Table
3). Delays in the progress of irrigation would result in delays in the con-
struction or underutilized capacity in the early 1980's, but the project shows
satisfactory financial and economic returns even in these eventualities.
Financial Viability
21.       Based on the ex-factory price of sugar calculated according to the
statutory formula (para 12), the financial rate of return to HSI would be 16%
(Table 10). Details of sensitivity tests are shown below:
Assumption                                                        Rate of Return
Sugar price at official level (Dr 18.2/kg)
(rate of return to the Government)                                    26%
Sugar price at EEC target price level (Dr 15.8/kg)                      14%
Sugar price at projected export price (Dr 17/kg)                        22%
Underutilized capacity                                                  14%
22.       It should be noted that the financial rate of return to HSI is
largely predetermined by the pricing policy (para 12) and would be affected
only by marketing problems or changes in pricing policies. As long as Greece
were not fully integrated into the EEC, marketing problems would be temporary,
arising only if demand did not grow as rapidly as anticipated. With EEC
membership, as long as Greece obtains a quota which covers her total produc-
tion, financial viability would not be jeopardized. Even if the Orestias
factory's production were not covered by the EEC quota, the rate of return
would be sound given the high projected world sugar price. The world market
fluctuations coupled with fluctuations in weather pose considerable risks,
but these are borne by the Ministry of Commerce who would still buy from HSI
at the guaranteed price. Even if HSI exported directly, the international
price would have to fall to 11 i per lb. before the financial rate of return
falls below 11%.
23.       Financial projections for the expansion of the Orestias plant are
shown in Tables 8 and 9. They indicate that throughout project implementation
the liquidity position will be somewhat tight. Minimum debt service coverage
(1.18x) occurs in 1978, when debt repayments more than double compared to pre-
vious years; coverage is nevertheless satisfactory throughout project imple-
mentation.

ANNEX 3
APPRAISAL OF

Water Requirements, Supply and Quality
A. Water Requirement
1.        Rainfall in the project area is inadequate during the summer months
necessitating supplemental irrigation. Irrigation requirements during the
dry season would vary with crop, amount of effective rainfall, temperature
and wind velocity. The weighted average net crop irrigation demand, using the
Blaney-Criddle method, would be about 4,890 m3/ha or a total of 18.43 Mm3/year.
The gross project irrigation requirement, assuming 80% overall efficiency of
the sprinkler system would be 23.04 Mm3 (Table 1). The peak delivery re-
quirement would be about 0.75 1/sec/ha on a 24-hour delivery basis. Project
facilities would, however, be designed to cater for 18 hours' operation or
about 1 1/sec/ha.
B. Water Supply and Quality
2.        About 75 tubewells (average depth 40 meters) equipped with turbine
pumps of capacity around 150 m3/hr each would be installed for the project,
each serving about 40 hectares. LRS had drilled 14 boreholes in the project
area to assess the aquifer. Six of these boreholes were converted into test
wells and water level recovery data used to determine the aquifer potential.
The quantity and quality of groundwater is found adequate. The volume of
aquifer was assessed as 350 Mm3 and the safe yield of tubewells as 150 m3/hr.
The aquifer material was sandy gravel with good specific capacity. The water
quality tests showed that the total dissolved salts in the water ranged
between 270 parts per million and 590 parts per million. Chemical analysis
showed that its sodium absorption ratio was about 1.2 only. The aquifer would
be recharged annually by the Erythropotamos river and its tributaries during
winter, which is their normal high-flow season. The project area being some-
what undulated would be better served by a sprinkler system with fixed supply
mains and mobile irrigation lines which is being used in Greece.

Hydrology and Riparian Aspects
Background
1.        The Evros is an international river with its total catchment area
of about 53,000 km2. Greece has about 6%; Turkey, 28% and Bulgaria, 66%. It
empties into the Mediterranean Sea with an average annual peak flow gauged
above the confluence with the Erythropotamos of about 1,500 m3/sec.
2.        The Erythropotamos, which is one of the Evros' tributaries, drains
a catchment area of about 1,560 km2, of which about 40% is located in Bulgaria
in the headwater to the north, and the remainder in Greece to the south. It
carries an average annual peak flow estimated at about 300 m3/sec. Almost
every year it floods the lower valley in Greece before emptying into the
Evros that borders with Turkey.
3.        The project dikes would be built along the Erythropotamos banks
in the flooded valley to reclaim the flooded area (3,500 ha gross). The
existing river channel between the proposed dikes would be rectified and im-
proved to be capable of discharging up to 50-year flood (about 1,100 m3/sec).
Design Flood Approaches
4.        Two methods were used in determining the design flood for the pro-
posed project dike construction:
(a) The basic regional empirical formula, which involves rainfall
intensity and the catchment area; and
(b) The synthetic unit hydrograph, which involves catchment area,
lag time and design storm.
The inherent weakness in these two approaches is rainfall data which are from
only one station (Mikro Derion). An alternative study using the dimensionless
unit graph and flood frequency based on the Evros flow data gauged at Pithion
has been made in thLe appraisal review. This approach precludes the use of
available rainfall data which might not be reliable. However, the results
obtained by the alternative are comparable with those derived by the two
previous methods. They are:

Adopted Design Flood (1,075 m3/sec)
5.        Since the project flood protected area is relatively small (esti-
mated only 3,000 ha net), it is considered justified to adopt the flood having
its return period of about 50 years as the project design flood for dike con-
struction. Larger design floods would necessitate wider river channel between
the dikes bringing more of the fertile cultivated land inside and under the
dikes and reducing the project benefits. In fact, the dikes, as proposed,
could theoretically resist flood having the return period up to about 100
years (1,500 m3/sec), should the dike free-board space (1.00 m in depth) also
be considered to be occupied by the flood. Therefore, the adopted 1,075
m3/sec as the project design peak flood is adequate. According to the unit
hydrograph and the prevailing baseflow of the Erythropotamos, the design flood
volume was estimated at about 117 Mm3.
Flood Routing
6.        The 50-year flood routing through the river channel that is proposed
to be diked has been computerized through a mathematical model (by consul-
tants - SOGREAH, France), also taking into account the existing flood storage
(from 1:5,000 scale maps) in the case of the "without project" conditions, and
the diked channel storage in the case of "with project" conditions. The tribu-
tary flows along the diked section were included in both cases. In the case
of 100-year flood, the approximate routing has been done by the appraisal
review based on the SOGREAH data.  The results are given:

50-year Outflow at Didimotichon                     965              1,040
100-year Outflow at Didimotichon                  1,370              1,500
Design Channel Capacity After Diking
7.        Based on the design flood (1,075 m3/sec), the total river channel
capacity between the proposed dikes was set at 1,100 m3/sec at the maximum
flood level. It was also proposed that the major section (central) would be
capable of carrying 250 m3/sec within its banks. At the point of overtopping
the dikes (with 1.00-m freeboard provided) the channel would carry about 1,500
m3/sec, which is equivalent to about 100-year flood.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
Maximum Tailwater Level
8.        The maximum tailwater level at the confluence with the Evros was set
at Elevation + 22.75 m which corresponds to the maximum ever recorded level
gauged at Pythion (13.5 km above the confluence) since 1897. The correspond-
ing flow of the Evros at Pythion was estimated at about 8,000 m3/sec, which
is equivalent to the 200-year flood. Therefore, the adopted tailwater at
Elevation + 22.75 appears to be adequately conservative.
Effect of Future Derion Dam Upstream
9.        There is development potential of a storage dam at Derion in the
headwater area. The dam, if built, would control about 30% of the
Erythropotamos catchment, and would help reduce the project flood magnitude.
However, the reduction would be limited to the flood surcharge space to be
provided at the dam. Even on the conservative basis, the flood reduction,
if any, would be of the order of only 10% of the project design flood.
Since the implementation appears to be in the distant future if made, and
the impact, if any, would be relatively small, it is not taken into account
in the project design.
Drainage Design Criteria
10.       The design discharge for the main drainage channels and drainage
pumping stations was determined on the basis of 10-year one-day storm rain-
fall. As a result, the specific discharge for drains was found to be 6
1/sec/ha. This was used as the basis for designing drainage in the areas
behind the project dikes.
Channel Regime
11.       According to the mathematical model, the 50-year flow velocity in
the central channel of the diked river would be about 3 m/sec. During high
flows, therefore, the scour and erosion of the central channel would be ex-
pected. Provision has been made in the estimate for protection along the
banks in critical reaches. This aspect would be given a special considera-
tion during the detailed design of the protection works.
12.       As additional protection to the flood dikes, strips of poplar would
be planted adjacent to the dikes on the riverside, to tame the river current
along the dikes. The roughness reflecting this protection would be taken into
account in design.
13.       The existing river slope would be maintained as far as possible in
the final design so that the river regime is disturbed as little as possible.
14.       Due to vagaries of flow in the river, erosion and siltation would
occur in the river channel depending upon the stages of flow as in any natural
channel. The agency responsible for maintenance of the works would ensure
that maintenance actions are taken in time to avoid progressive degradation
of the works.



ANNEX 4

Impact of Diki ng upon Turkey
15.       The computerized mathematical model study by the project consultant
also shows that under the design flood conditions the increase in stream
current velocity due to construction of dikes would be about 4 cm/sec (from
0.48 m/sec to 0.52 m/sec) in the main channel of the Erythropotamos at the
confluence, for the conservative condition of low flows in the Evros. Such
a small increment in velocity would cause no discernible changes in existing
river regimes, and hence no adverse effects to Greece or Turkey. Even under
the extreme case when the Erythropotamos flood would be in excess of the
design level (50-year flood) and rise into the provided dike freeboard space
(1.0 m in depth) to the point of overtopping the dikes, the impact in terms
of increase in flow velocity from the "without project" conditions would be
about 7 cm/sec (from 0.68 m/sec to 0.75 m/sec) in the main channel of the
Erythropotamos at the confluence, for the conservative condition of low flows
in the Evros. This incremental velocity is again insignificant and would not
cause any discernible change in existing river regime. Besides, the long-term
historical data show that with about 95% probability the Evros high-flow
stages would coincide with the Erythropotamos floods. The retarding effects
by the backwater from the prevailing high flow in the Evros would further
reduce the velocity impact. Should a more severe flood than the 100-year
frequency flood occur, it would overtop the dikes and produce no more impact
than the 100-year flood.
Impact of Project Groundwater Extraction upon Turkey
16.       The impact of the project groundwater extraction upon the Evros
runoff would not be significant. The total yearly extraction from the aquifer
would be about 23 Mm3 which is equivalent to a withdrawal rate of 1.50 m3/sec
over a period of six months. Compared with the Evros dry season flow of
about 150 m3/sec the extraction would be negligible. In fact, the total
withdrawal would be a small fraction of 1% of the average estimated annual
runoff of 7,500 Mm3 of the Evros river.
Impact of Diking upon Bulgaria
17.       Bulgaria's border is located about 4 km upstream of Metaxades, the
starting point of the project dikes. The river slope in this reach is quite
steep (2 m/km) and therefore the backwater effect arising from diking cannot
extend to the border.
Impact of any Possible Extractions from Erythropotamos in Bulgaria
18.       Erythropotamos has two major tributaries upstream of project area.
One, draining about 40% of the catchment area of the river, flows entirely in
Bulgaria before meeting the other tributary at the Bulgaria-Greece border. The
other, draining about 30% of the river catchment area, mainly flows through
Greece, cuts across the southeast corner of Bulgaria for a length of about five
kilometers, then runs along the border and back into Greece. The nature of
terrain through which it traverses in Bulgaria preempts diversion of its t-ater

for use in Bulgaria. Besides, before this tributary enters Bulgaria, it can
be dammed by Greece at Mikro Derion dam site if they so wished. The risk of
Bulgaria doing any work on this tributary is therefore negligible. The Greek
Government has informed Bulgaria of the project component on Erythropotamos
during a meeting of the Joint Greek-Bulgarian Commission on hydroeconomic
matters in November 1976. According to the Greek Government, Bulgaria has no
plans for any work on the river tributaries in their catchment. Even if
Bulgaria interferes with the tributary running entirely in their territory
the project would not be adversely affected as sufficient recharge would be
available from the catchment and other tributaries of the river.

Irrigation Component
Operation and Maintenance Costs
1.        Annual maintenance costs at full development have been estimated as
percentages of the corresponding investments, i.e. 2% for field improvement
works, 3% for tubewells and mobile sprinklers equipment and 1% for under-
ground water supply mains. The annual maintenance cost would be Dr 2,120
per hectare.
2.        The operating staff would consist of one waterman and one techni-
cian for every 400 ha. Other supervision would be provided by the farmers'
water users' associations (TOEVs). The average cost of the maintenance staff
would be Dr 220 per ha.
3.        Electric consumption for an average delivery of 6,100 cubic meters
per hectare would be about 1,800 kwh. Based on the Public Power Corporation's
tariff of Dr 1.20 per kwh, the annual cost of electricity used would be
Dr 2,160 per ha.
4.        Total annual Operation and Maintenance charges would therefore be
Dr 4,500 ($123) per ha.

Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
A. Aggregate Rate of Return
1.        The aggregate rate of return is estimated at 16% based on costs and
benefits of major productive components. Including all project costs, the
rate of return would be 12%, but this excludes benefits from smaller invest-
ments which are dispersed throughout Evros and only marginally affect the Bank
financed components. To illustrate:
(a) technical education would provide skilled manpower essential
to production;
(b) water supply would improve health and productivity;
(c) support of agricultural and veterinary services would improve
their effectiveness to increase crop yields and reduce loss
of livestock, particularly as Evros forms a defense barrier
for western Europe against the Asiatic strain of foot and
mouth disease;
(d) provision of paved road maintenance equipment would help to
reduce the costs of maintenance by allowing the work to be
carried out by force account instead of by contract;
(e) project establishment and the Nomarchy Fund would ensure
effective allocation of investments; and
(f) community centers, streets, and markets would have some produc-
tive impact, and would contribute to reducing the disparity in
standard of living between Evros and other regions of Greece,
thereby reducing emigration.
2.        Sensitivity of the overall rate of return would be as shown below:
(a)  15% increase in costs                              10%
(b)  15% decrease in costs                              25%
(c)  15% increase in benefits                           24%
(d)  15% decrease in benefits                            9%
Details of this computation are shown in Table 1, while the analysis of each
component is discussed below.

B. Extension of Orestias Sugar Plant
3.        The economic rate of return on extension of the Orestias sugar plant
is estimated at 15%, based on 20-year life which takes account of possible
changes in technology rather than the expected productive life of the installa-
tions which may exceed 50 years. The rate of return is sensitive to changes
in the price of sugar and operating costs as shown below:
(a)  10% decrease in gross benefits                      5%
(b)  10% increase in gross benefits                     25%
(c)  10% increase in investment costs                   13%
(d)  10% increase in operating costs                     7%
(e)  10% decrease in operating costs                    23%
(f)  underutilized capacity (1981-83)                   12%
(g)  2-year delay in construction schedule              13%
This sensitivity does not reflect a particular weakness of this project which
has a low capital cost, as it is an expansion. As regards operating costs,
some economies are expected with the increase in the size of operations and
HSI's management is making efforts to minimize costs.
4.        Any investment in sugar processing involves some risks given the
notoriously volatile world market price of sugar. However, these fluctuations
do not reflect changes in long-term demand or in the costs of production. In
the past, supply and demand have grown steadily but prices have fluctuated
due to temporary changes in stock, climatic conditions, and lags in supply
response influenced by low prices in preceding periods (Chart 1). In the
coming years, competition from high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) mi-ht reduce
the world demand for sugar. However, recent Bank studies conclude that, while
its effect would be to slow down the rate of growth of demand, particularly in
the United States in the next few years, the absolute level of demand would
increase and that this demand must be met by investment in new capacity. 1/
The Bank's projected world price for 1980-1985 reflects the cost of production
to meet this demand, estimated at 14.91 per lb. raw (960 Pol) or 20 to 221
per lb. refined. 1/ Using a conservative estimate of the refining margin and
allowing for transport costs, the ex-factory price of imported white sugar was
estimated for this analysis at 21.21 per lb.
5.        In considering the risks involved, it must be kept in mind that
domestic production has the advantage of an assured supply at a stable price
and that the rate of return is based on the long-term average price, i.e.,
the expected value of sugar in a risk-ridden situation. A sensitivity
test for underutilized capacity in the first few years also shows that low
prices in some years would not affect project viability significantly.
Moreover, the low production cost of the expanded Orestias factory (about
1/   Commodity Paper No. 20 and draft Board Paper on Sugar, "The World
Sugar Market: Review and Outlook for Bank Group Lending".

17.34 per lb). relative to the projected price reflects its relaLive effi-
ciency (Annex 2). Details of the rate of return calculation are given in
Tables 2 and 3.
C. Erythropotamos Valley Flood Control and Irrigation
6.        The estimated rate of return on flood protection and irrigation
in the Erythropotamos Valley and the results of sensitivity tests are as
follows:
Basic Estimate:                                          14%
Sensitivity Tests:
(a)  15% increase in capital costs                       12%
(b)  15% decrease in capital costs                       16%
(c)  15% decrease in benefits                            11%
(d)  15% increase in benefits                            16%
15% increase in all costs and
15% decrease in all benefits                        8%
7.        Irrigation would increase yields by enabling greater use of fer-
tilizers, adoption of improved varieties and an intensified cropping pattern
(Table 4). The assumptions of improved yields are based on missions' observa-
tions of well-managed local farms, study of research stations in Northern
Greece and discussions with local technical staff of the Ministry of Agricul-
ture. Such improvements would develop over five years following completion
of works, 50% in the first year, 20% in the second, and 10% more in each of
the next 3 years, reaching 100% in the fifth year.
8.        Benefits from flood protection include flood damages saved (Table 5).
To compute the expected value of annual loss, estimates made by the local LRS
of areas flooded and their frequency were used in the absence of more precise
data. In view of the steep-sided profile of the valley, less frequent floods
would not affect significantly larger areas and could be ignored. Damage
to crops and infrastructure by floods against which protection has not been
provided were also taken into account. The progress of irrigation flood
protection would be as follows:
Area          Area Protected from
Year          Irrigated (ha)       Flood (ha)
1979              500                  900
1980            1,500                2,100
_                  1981            2,400                 3,000
1982            3,000
9.        Details of costs of production and prices used are shown on
Tables 6 and 7 respectively.

D. Rural Roads
10.       With adequate maintenance, the rural roads have effectively an
indefinite economic life. For the purposes of the present analysis, an
economic life of 40 years has been assumed; and, on this basis, the return
to the rural roads component as a whole is estimated at 33%. Returns have
been computed separately for each of the 25 areas, and all roads show a
return of 10% or more. Details of the sensitivity of the overall return
are given below:
Rate of Return
(a)  Construction costs increased by 15%                  29%
(b)  Construction costs decreased by 15%                  38%
(c)  Total benefits increased by 15%                      40%
(d)  Total benefits decreased by 15%                      26%
(e)  Combination of (a) and (d)                           23%
1I.       Benefits considered in this analysis include increased crop produc-
tion due to timely application of inputs and satisfactory harvesting. Given
the level of support services provided to farmers in Evros, the lack of all-
weather roads could constrain attainment of maximum yields, as experienced
in other parts of Evros.
12.       Provision of gravel roads would have a significant impact on trans-
port costs. Based on information from the area, the transport costs would be
at least 70% higher if the gravel roads are not built. The following are the
future expected costs:
Transport Costs
Crop                             (Dr per ha)
Wheat                                1,540
Barley                              1,440
Maize                                1,380
Alfalfa                              1,960
Sugar beet                          2,090
Beans                                 550
Vegetables                          1,160
Other crops                         1,400
13.       Costs of road construction, administration and maintenance are
shown in Table 10. A rate of return of 10% would accrue even if there is
no increase in crop production.

E. Conr-ction Roads
14.       Based on a construction period of four years for the whole project
and an economic life of 20 years, the overall return to road construction is
estimated at 22%. Details of the sensitivity of the project to changes in
construction costs and benefits and returns for individual roads are provided
below:

15.       The benefits from road construction have been quantified as the
savings in operating costs resulting from an improved road surface. In
the case of roads 9 and 10a, account has also been taken of the savings in
operating costs resulting from the reduced length of the roads. Benefits not
taken into account include the time savings of vehicle occupants other than
professional drivers and the improved comfort and safety for road users that
will result from Lhe construction of bitumen roads.
16.       Based on information received from the Government and on previous
studies by Ingeroute, the characteristics and operating costs of these vehi-
cles on a level, tangent, paved road in good condition are:

17.       The effect on these costs of a design speed of 60 km/hour, which
is lower than the average for paved roads, would not be significant. From
mission inspection, operating costs on the proposed bitumen roads have been
assessed at 20% less than the costs on existing gravel surfaces.
18.       Details of the volume and composition of traffic on the ten connec-
tion roads are given in Table 9. Vehicle distribution was as follows:

ANNEX 14
Page 7
19.       Nationwide traffic surveys conducted in Greece in 1965 and 1972
gave an annual traffic growth rate of about 12%. Traffic growth in the region
has been conservatively estimated at 6% per annum for the period 1977 to 1987,
and 5% thereafter, taking into account a slower rate of growth of GDP and the
anticipated expansion in agricultural production in Evros.
20.       The economic costs of road construction and maintenance are shown
on Table 9.
21.       The benefits of the road maintenance equipment component have not
been separately quantified, but experience from similar projects in other
parts of Greece suggests that the return would be very high.
F. Forest Roads, Housing and Transport
22.       Based on an economic life for the roads of 40 years, the return to
investments in forest roads, housing and transport is estimated at 55%, the
high return being primarily a result of the exploitation of an accumulated
as well as a sustained yield (Table 12). Due to a low ratio of net to total
benefits, the return is very sensitive to changes in the cost and benefit
streams, but a decrease in benefits of 15% would still result in a return
of 22%. Results of the sensitivity analysis are as follows:
Rate of Return
(a)  15% increase in road construction costs            39%
(b)  15% decrease in road construction costs            77%
(c)  15% increase in benefits                           92%
(d)  15% decrease in benefits                           22%
23.       The benefits included in the analysis are the increased production
of forest products (Table 10).
24.       The estimated percentage breakdown of the incremental production by
type of wood product is as follows:
Pine      Oak       Beech        Total
Sawlogs A                   3.2      3.3        0.2          6.7
B                  3.2       4.9        0.6          8.7
Boxshooks                   8.0       -          -           8.0
Industrial Wood            13.0       -         4.3         17.3
Parquet                      -       15.2        -          15.2
Fuelwood                    4.6     38.6        0.9         44.1
Total                      32.0     62.0        6.0        100.0
Prices and costs of production used in the analysis are shown in Table 11.



ANNEX 14
Page 8
24.       Excluded from the analysis are the benefits of the new housing
and transport to existing forest production and the savings in operating
costs that would accrue to the non-forest traffic using the new roads.
G. Pine Reforestation
25.       The economic return to pine reforestation has been estimated at 8%
(Table 10). However, the analysis only takes account of incremental produc-
tion based on a rotation period of from 20 to 40 years (see below) and ignores
other economic benefits such as protection against soil erosion and the in-
creased allowable cut effect through shortening of rotation and more intensive
production. When these other benefits are also considered, the project would
seem well justified. As yet, no reliable local data is available on growth
rates of Pinus radiata, maritima and nigra; but, based on studies carried
under similar soil and climatic conditions, the following estimates of yields
and rotations have been made:
Proposed
Hectarage   Yield per Ha (m3)   % Sawlogs   Rotation (yrs)
Pinus radiata           390            300                85            20
Pinus maritima          980            250                65            35
Pinus nigra           1,630            400                85            40
26.       Economic prices and market prospects for pine products have already
been detailed as have the likely economic costs of harvesting. These are
shown on Table 11.
27.       An allowance has also been made for annual routine maintenance over
the life of the project and for the costs of an additional 30 km of forest
roads which will be needed at the end of the rotation time.

/2  Without the project, floods cover approximately 3,650 ha damaging crops over 3,190 ha with a frequency of 1 year in 2; and
approximately 1,750 ha damaging crops over 1,300 ha with a frequency of 1 year in 2. Additional areas affected by larger
floods are insignificant due to the steep-sided profile of the valley. Differences in costs of production with and costs
without floods have also been taken into account; these are estimated to be Dr 3,300 present, Dr 6,200 future without
project and 11,100 future with project.
/3  15% capital cost of irrigation and flood control dikes with probability 0.01.  Damages on existing infrastructure have not
been included as they are insignificant.
/4  The project effectively provides protection against "100-year" floods although the works are designed for "50-year" floods.

at the optimum time and is not a reflection of any increase in the
quantity of inputs.  Any additional transport costs are taken into
account in the change in road operating costs.  Average increments in
yields of 0.2 tons/ha have been assumed for wheat, barley and alfalfa                       
and 0.1 tons/ha for maize.
