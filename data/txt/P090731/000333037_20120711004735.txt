F. Results Framework Analysis
Project Development Objective (PDO), Global Environment Objective (GEO) and Key
Indicators (as approved)

The Project Appraisal Document detailed both a Project Development Objective (PDO) and a
Global Environment Objective (GEO), although most of the references and indicators refer to the
PDO.

The PDO was to support efforts by Dominica, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the Grenadines to
implement specific (integrated) pilot adaptation measures addressing primarily, the impacts of
climate change on their natural resources base, focused on biodiversity and land degradation
along coastal and near-coastal areas. They were achieved through: (i) the detailed design of pilot
adaptation measures to reduce expected negative impacts of climate change on biodiversity and
land degradation; and (ii) the implementation of pilot adaptation investments. Reducing these
impacts would primarily result in protection of biodiversity and prevention of land degradation
but would also induce economic benefits in the tourism, fisheries, agriculture and forestry sectors.
It would also help maintain the resource base upon which these economic activities rely,
promoting a climate resilient sustainable development.

The Global Environment Objective was to produce knowledge that would be of global value on
how to implement adaptation measures in small island states, which could be applicable to other
countries in the region, and in the world, even if they were not participating in the project.

Revised PDO, GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators and
reasons/justifications

Neither the PDO nor the GEO were modified after the restructuring of the Project, which took
place in September 2010. However, the key indicators were revised in order to establish a better
link with Project objectives. As a result, the number of indicators increased from the original
eight to 15 after project restructuring. This review managed to frame the expected achievements
in a clearer and more organized way, and proved to be beneficial for Project management.

      Implementation Completion and Results Report for the OECS Implementation of Adaptation
                           Measures in Coastal Zones Project (P090731)

1. Project Context, Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.       This Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) describes the results of the Regional
Implementation of Adaptation Measures in Coastal Zones Project, GEF Grant funded through the Special
Program on Adaptation (SPA), approved by the Board in September 2006 and restructured in October
2010. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) Trust Fund grant in the amount of US$2.1 million became
effective on February 1, 2007 and the closing date was June 30, 2011, extended until December 31, 2011.
The recipient was the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre (CCCCC) which is the region‟s
climate change (CC) institution whose mandate is to provide climate change-related policy advice to the
Caribbean Community Member States through the Caribbean Community Secretariat. (CARICOM)

2.       The Project objective was to support the efforts of Dominica, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines to implement specific, integrated pilot adaptation measures that primarily address the impacts
of CC on their natural resources base, with a focus on biodiversity and land degradation along coastal and
near-coastal areas. The three participating countries belong to the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States (OECS), a region characterized by a rich biodiversity endowment, which, in combination with its
isolation from other areas, has resulted in relatively high rates of national and regional endemism. The
Caribbean has been identified by a survey of the world‟s biodiversity hotspots as the fifth ranking hotspot
and one of the highest priorities in any global strategy for biodiversity conservation and sustainable
management1. The principal ecosystems are dry and humid tropical forests, wetlands and tidal flats, sandy
and rocky beaches, coral reefs, sea-grass beds, mangroves, and offshore islets. The reef, sea-grass and
mangrove systems of this area are recognized as among the most productive in the world.

3.       As this was one of the first CC adaptation projects in the Bank, the design addressed the need of
piloting adaptation measures seeking global benefits while acknowledging the structural constraints at the
national and regional level. The challenge was to develop a strategy addressing issues of government
capacity to address adaptation in three different countries through the empowerment of a regional entity
such as CCCCC. During preparation most of the risks were identified and appropriate mitigations were
proposed. However, several difficulties appeared in the implementation phase due to weaknesses in the
original assessment of project costs. Furthermore, the international financial crisis (2008-2009)
undermined the capacity of national governments and other donors to contribute to the implementation, as
was originally proposed.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

4.      At appraisal, there was evidence that CC was a serious challenge faced by global ecosystems. The
emission of greenhouse gases was a matter of concern since scientific understanding indicated that it
would increase the earth‟s mean surface temperature between 1.5 and 5.8 degrees Celsius during the next
100 years2. A change of this magnitude would result in significant impacts at a global scale. Along with
changes in the mean climatic conditions, the biosphere potentially faced irreversible and catastrophic
impacts associated with the reduction of thermo-hyaline circulation, the subsidence of small islands and

increases in the intensity of hurricanes, among others. Overall, these impacts would be especially
significant in vulnerable regions such as small island states, and the Caribbean was amongst the most
vulnerable regions to these impacts, threatening the planet‟s biodiversity. A CC adaptation Project was
thus pertinent to mitigate these effects as much as possible.

5.       Climate Change was also expected to affect the physical and biological characteristics of the
Caribbean Sea and its coastal areas, modifying ecosystem structures and its functioning. Moreover,
scientific understanding at the time of appraisal indicated that, in near-shore marine and coastal areas,
many wetlands and coastal forests would be affected by changes in sea level and storm surges.
Mangroves and coastal lagoons were expected to undergo rapid change and perhaps be lost altogether as
functioning ecosystems. Low-lying coastal areas and associated wetlands could also be displaced by salt
water habitats, disrupting fresh-water based ecosystems. Such changes were likely to result in dislocation
of migratory birds and aquatic species, not tolerant to increased salinity or flooding. In addition, climate
variability and intensification of hurricanes posed a significant threat to the sustainable development of
Small Island Developing States. There has been an increase in the intensity and number of hurricanes in
the Caribbean basin since 1970, associated to warmer sea surface temperatures. This has major
implications for coastal zones in most countries on the Caribbean Basin, affecting coastal infrastructure
and ecosystems and possibly forcing permanent displacement of people from coastal zones.

6.       The OECS region was highly dependent on the degree of resilience of the natural resources base
that supports the key economic sector and activities (Annex 2 illustrates some of the effects of CC on the
natural resources base and how it affected economic activity in the region) to CC impacts, climate
variability and land degradation. The participating countries recognized fully that they had no choice but
to aggressively pursue an integrated development approach that inter alia could take full account of the
predicted and actual impacts of global CC, climate variability, the impacts on biodiversity and land
degradation. This recognition was reflected in a number of national policies and strategies, both planned
and implemented, including National Climate Change policies; A National Biodiversity Strategy and
Action Plan (NBSAP); the National Action Plan for Implementation of the UNCCD; Natural Hazard
Mitigation Policy and National Capacity Self Assessments. However, limited financial, human and
technical resources within these three participating countries posed a challenge to the effective and full
implementation of these strategies.

7.      Recognizing the importance of adopting an integrated approach to climate change adaptation,
Dominica, Saint Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines were the first three countries in the region to
adopt a comprehensive adaptation framework which gave them the best position amongst Caribbean
nations to implement pilot adaptation investments. They had already taken basic decisions toward
mainstreaming CC concerns in the development process, by developing national climate change plans,
which allowed them to provide valuable and complementary feedback to the efforts already in
implementation. The three countries had all ratified the UNFCCC, UNCCD, and CBD, and were active
participants.

8.      Within this context, the World Bank (WB) had already been involved in the region through a
number of operations that helped build momentum on the need to take action against climate change-
induced impacts. The Bank‟s involvement in climate change adaptation in the Caribbean began in 1998,
with the GEF CPACC Project (Caribbean Planning for Adaptation to Global Climate Change) (1998-
2001). The WB continued its involvement with climate change adaptation work in the region as the
Implementing Agency for the GEF-funded “Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change? (MACC)
Project (2003-2007) which aimed at supporting the development of an enabling environment for climate
change adaptation in CARICOM countries. The WB also had other sources of experience in the area of
adaptation planning in Small Island Developing States (SIDS), through the Kiribati Adaptation Project
(2005-2008), and the GEF-funded OECS Protected Areas and Associated Livelihoods (OPAAL) Project

(2005-2010), together with a robust agenda on disaster risk management activities in Saint Lucia, from
which the SPACC Project would benefit. These benefits included already existing relationships with
relevant institutions such as the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Physical Planning, Ministry of Works and
the National Emergency Management Office.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO), Global Environment Objective (GEO) and
Key Indicators (as approved)

9.       The Project Development Objective (PDO) was to support efforts by Dominica, Saint Lucia and
St. Vincent and the Grenadines to implement specific (integrated) pilot adaptation measures addressing
primarily, the impacts of climate change on their natural resources base, focused on biodiversity and land
degradation along coastal and near-coastal areas. This would be achieved through: (i) the detailed design
of pilot adaptation measures to reduce expected negative impacts of climate change on marine and
terrestrial biodiversity and land degradation; and (ii) the implementation of pilot adaptation investments.

10.      The Global Environment Objective was to produce knowledge that would be of global value on
how to implement adaptation measures in small island states, which could be applicable to other countries
in the region, and in the world, even if they were not participating in the project. The value of these early
lessons would make the GEF resources applied, more cost-effective in the medium term. The Project
complements the goals of the Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change in the Caribbean (MACC)
Project and applies the lessons and information gathered through the Caribbean Planning for Adaptation
to Climate Change (CPACC) Project by piloting the implementation of adaptation measures in countries
that have already taken mainstreaming decisions and seek to execute specific measures to address the
impacts of climate change on biodiversity and land degradation.

1.3 Revised PDO and GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

11.      Neither the PDO nor the GEO have been modified throughout the duration of the project, and
remain valid. The Project was restructured in October 2010 and the main reasons for the restructuring
were: First, the Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines had decided not to implement two of
their three pilots, thus reducing the total number of pilots from the initial seven pilots to five. Second,
some indicators needed to be reviewed to better reflect measurable results for which the Project could be
held accountable. Third, some adjustments needed to be made in the disbursement categories to allow for
the financing of workshops and operating costs. Fourth, the proceeds of the grant had to be reallocated to
compensate for the financial constraints that the participant countries had suffered during the financial
crisis. After the mid-term review, some of the key indicators were revised to reflect the actual scope of
pilot activities, integrated into a revised Results Framework and Monitoring Matrix (Annex 4).

12.     The Project was funded by the Special Program for Adaptation of the GEF, and was conceived as
beneficial for biodiversity. However, the indicators used before restructuring were overly ambitious, and
the enhancement on environmental conditions that would in turn safeguard biodiversity could not be fully
achieved by a Project of this nature and size. Moreover, impacts on environmental baselines and changes
in biodiversity can only be measured in the long term. The project has promoted better management of
anthropogenic activities that generate pressures on the environment (agriculture, wastewater production
and others), which in turn yield benefits for global public goods such as biodiversity and ecosystems.

13.      The revision of indicators proved to be a very positive decision. The number of indicators was
originally eight. With the restructuring fifteen indicators were defined (Table 1). These are more precise
than those in the original design of the Project, and they have made a difference to the quality of the
Project by better framing its achievements, outcomes, and facilitating monitoring and management.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.     The SPACC Project was a climate change adaptation Project, with a strong focus on biodiversity
protection. The Project addressed the main drivers of biodiversity loss and tests pilot measures to mitigate
them. The activities implemented by SPACC have primarily focused on impacts of climate change on the
global commons (mainly biodiversity, but also water resources, land degradation and reduction of CO2
emissions). The Project has been successful in showing how specific adaptation activities and planning
can be practically translated into a national dialogue and ultimately national policy. The Project pilots
have been designed in the context of climate change, addressing present and future climate change
impacts.

15.      Another significant benefit arises from the gathered knowledge, of global value, on how to
implement adaptation measures in small island states that can be scaled up within participating countries
and also applied to other countries in the region, and even for islands in other areas of the world, as
demonstrated by the knowledge exchanges between the project team at the Bank and teams working on
similar issues in the Pacific islands. The knowledge generated through the Project has benefited the
participating countries, the implementing agency (which is the regional center of excellence on climate
change issues), and the Bank. It has also strengthened national capacities to implement multiple multi-
lateral environmental agreements, the so-called three Rio conventions (dealing with biodiversity, climate
change, desertification), which implies an increased local capacity to implement such agreements.

16.      Finally, the Project has also produced benefits at the national and local level. The Project‟s main
direct beneficiaries include local populations who would benefit from the adaptation measures
implemented through SPACC, which bring about biodiversity conservation, improved stewardship and
better management of natural protected areas. All pilot activities implemented in Dominica are developed
on or around their National Parks, with the objective of protecting them against anthropogenic impacts.
At the same time, they have benefited local farmers of the Milton area communities, and the National
Government through the strengthening of information and monitoring capabilities at the Ministry of
Agriculture. The Saint Lucia pilot implemented in Fort Vieux managed to eliminate the direct outflow of
waste water from a large touristic resort into Point Sable National Park, which safeguards biodiversity at
the National Park, prevents further land degradation, and protects water resources in the area. It also
benefits the tourism sector, crucial in the Caribbean, since it reduces water consumption that is currently
being purchased from the water supply company. The other Saint Lucia pilot, the retrofitting of the
Marchand building (which is a community center on a poor neighborhood of the capital city, Castries),
has benefited the local communities who use the building as the main hurricane shelter in the area, as well
as for recreational and community engagement purposes. It has also provided lessons useful at the
national level for the replication of building codes and modalities into other hurricane shelters. The pilot
implemented in Saint Vincent, if replicated, is expected to alleviate pressures on coastal aquifers, which
can be seen as a measure against land degradation. The photovoltaic system reduces the consumption of
fossil fuel on the island, further benefiting global common goods by deploying carbon-free technology. It
also benefits the Paget Farms area, where the poorest communities of the island are settled, by providing a
constant source of potable water.


1.5 Original Components (as approved)

Component 1: Identification, evaluation, selection and design of priority adaptation measures that
address impacts of climate change on biodiversity and land degradation



                                                     6
17.      This component‟s objective was to identify and design in detail (integrated) pilot adaptation
measures to reduce expected negative impacts of climate change on marine and terrestrial biodiversity
and land degradation in Participating Countries (PCs) Dominica, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines. The component had two sub-components: (i) feasibility analysis of adaptation measures; and
(ii) design of adaptation measures. The component was aimed at supporting the following activities: (i)
assessment of the current ecosystem and physical condition and trends in coastal areas of the Participating
Countries; (ii) provision of data by the MRI on estimated current and future temperature and rainfall
patterns along Project sites; (iii) analysis of specific climate change impacts, primarily concerning
biodiversity of global significance and assessment of alternatives including, inter alia, technical,
environmental, social, institutional, and risk and cost analyses; (iv) selection of recommended actions; (v)
technical, engineering design; (vi) environmental and social management plans; (vii) community
participation; (viii) M&E system design to measure the impacts of adopted measures; and (ix)
establishment and adoption of plans and cooperation agreements by PCs with local and regional
institutions and agencies for implementation of adaptation measures.

Component 2: Implementation of selected adaptation measures designed to address climate impacts
on biodiversity and land degradation.

18.      The component‟s objective was to implement specific pilot adaptation measures on seven sites in
the Participating Countries addressing primarily the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and land
degradation along coastal and near-coastal areas. This component had seven sub-components: (i) the
coordination of adaptation measures in the PCs; (ii) implementation of adaptation measures in Dominica,
identified in the management plan under component one; (iii) management of the Morne Trois Pitons
National Park Integrated Ecosystem (Dominica); (iv) sustainability of Water Resources and Supply of the
Vieux-Fort Region (Saint Lucia); (v) strengthening critical coastal infrastructure in the Castries area
(Saint Lucia); (vi) Integrated Ecosystem Approach to Climate Change (St. Vincent and the Grenadines);
and (vii) Climate Change Risk Management for Spring Village (St. Vincent and the Grenadines).

19.      This component was expected to support the following activities: (i) provision of data for
analyzing the pressures on biodiversity and land degradation from anticipated climate projections; (b) in-
country coordination and supervision by each of the PCs on the implementation of the relevant adaptation
measures; (iii) maintaining ecosystem integrity, and preventing its fragmentation and biodiversity losses
in the face of changes in temperature and rainfall patterns in Dominica; (iv) establishing adaptation
measures aimed at increased resilience to the impacts of climate change in Saint Lucia; (v) providing
scientific and engineering services required to assess vulnerabilities and define priorities in the Castries
region (Saint Lucia); (vi) completing Island Integrated Resource Management Plans and implementing
key adaptation measures to address water supply (Bequia); (vii) reducing vulnerability to climate change
impacts on Black Mangrove stands in Union Island; and (viii) including coral reefs affected by increased
sea surface temperatures and sea level rise based on the monitoring program supported through MACC.

Component 3: Strengthening of national capacity to implement multiple multilateral environmental
agreements.

20.     The component‟s objective was to finance goods and services required to develop and establish
the building blocks for addressing multiple convention objectives as adopted by the three governments
and promoted by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Convention
on Biological Diversity (CBD) and United Nations Convention to combat desertification and drought
(UNCCD). This component included three sub-components expected to support the following activities:
(i) developing a harmonized national reporting framework (i.e., legal, institutional and management
structures) by each Participating Country that integrates climate change, biodiversity and land degradation
obligations; (ii) providing technical assistance by IUCN to Participating Countries to develop a single

                                                     7
report using a harmonized national reporting framework; and (iii) testing of the application of a
harmonized framework in relation to specific adaptation measures supported by the Project.

Component 4: Project Management.

21.       The component‟s objective was to support the overall technical coordination of the Project
activities and to help with the operational expenditures directly related to the implementation,
management and monitoring of the Project. This component included two sub-components expected to
support the following activities: (i) administrative and financial management of the Project; (ii)
preparation of annual audits; (iii) operational expenditures comprising: equipment lease and maintenance,
utilities, office and scientific supplies and equipment, communications, vehicle fuel, bank charges, travel
and per diem of Project staff, and salaries of core Project staff hired for the duration of the Project, but
excluding salaries of any permanent staff of the participating countries.

22.      Additionally, this component was expected to develop a communication strategy for
communicating the results of the Project to other projects and to distribute information. The elements of
the strategy included (i) the upgrading of the web site of the CCCCC; (ii) the development of a monthly
electronic and printed newsletter; (iii) the participation in global and regional forums on adaptation; and,
iv) the publication of the description of the pilots and of the lessons learned in adequate technical journals.


1.6 Revised components

23.     The mid-term review (September 2010) included a thorough analysis of the project
implementation, identifying the constraints and recommending the restructuring of the project, while
leaving the philosophy of the components, their distribution and flow unchanged. The restructuring
involved dropping two of seven pilot projects, reallocating project proceeds and changes in the project
performance indicators to better reflect the objective of piloting adaptation measures while generating
global knowledge and ground experience to be replicated in other countries and regions. Since two pilots
were canceled, the overall scope of the Project was reduced. However, SPACC original objectives did not
change after the restructuring.

1.7 Other significant changes

24.      The project was restructured on September 14, 2010. Two out of the seven pilot projects were
canceled, resulting in a reduction of the total scope of the Project. The restructuring also included some
reallocation of proceeds amongst components to reflect higher costs in design (Component 1) and lower
costs in Component 3, and some modifications of the financing plan to reflect shortages of funds by the
participating countries, IUCN, and increased resources provided by CCCCC. Reasons are further
explained in section 2.2.

25.      The restructuring of the Project involved changes in the outcome indicators in order to more
accurately reflect the Project‟s objectives and the nature of the interventions; modifications to the Project
activities in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (cancelation of 2 pilots); adjustment of the disbursement
categories to finance workshops and operating costs; modification of the financing plan to close the
financing gap created by changes in the co-financing resources; and reallocation of the proceeds of the
GEF Trust Fund Grant. The changes in target values, monitoring instruments and responsibilities, as well
as costs by pilot are detailed in Annex 3.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

26.     Project preparation and design has followed Bank guidelines and has been based on previous
experiences gained from MACC, CPACC and related programs. Inherent in the design was a multi-
country, multi-agency approach which requires a high degree of interagency coordination. Execution
responsibilities were transferred by agreement to the CCCCC and the National counterpart execution has
been managed through national coordinators assigned to work with CCCCC. Stakeholder meetings were
held during the preparation phase and screening processes were used to identify candidate interventions.

27.      The Project was complex and ambitious given the funds available. While important on a regional
scale, the Project focused on pilot activities designed to address issues on a national scale. The blending
of the national and international perspectives resulted in a Project that was extremely ambitious
considering the level of funding available and the complexity of implementation. Moreover, the Project‟s
activities spanned from biodiversity protection and management of National Parks to infrastructure works
for building retrofitting, renewable energy production, meteorological monitoring or climate change
modeling and scenario generation. This variety of interventions would have required the participation of
many different types of expertise both in-country and at the implementing agency level. These challenges
were recognized and addressed by engaging experts on these different topics, but also required extra time
and resources.

28.      Project design lacked specificity. The description of the Components was general in nature and
actual activities were largely determined by the result of studies and designs prepared during the Project‟s
implementation. While this is not necessarily a problem in large projects, the funding levels appropriated
under this Project were insufficient to take this kind of approach. The Project had to be restructured, and
two out of the initial seven pilot interventions were dropped because of land tenure issues, not anticipated
during preparation. Most of the core time of Project implementation was devoted to agreeing on final
designs, finalizing them, and preparing bidding documents, instead of improving the operation
arrangements and performing monitoring of the different pilots. This process however proved to be useful
as different actors in the participating countries engaged in the decision making process during the design
phase, and obtained significant insights and capacities to improve the quality of interventions moving
forward, and be better prepared to scale up successful activities in the future.

29.      Lack of clear national counterparts that link responsibility with authority. A significant issue
inherent in Project design was the effectiveness of the implementation arrangements. In all cases, specific
national line agencies were engaged to support Project development through the use of a national
coordinator. Although the Grant Agreement stipulated that participating countries should provide
resources for national coordination, financial shortages generated in part by the international financial
crisis prevented this from happening (with the notable exception of Saint Lucia). The implementing
agency, however, stepped up to this challenge and with their own funds hired technical coordinators for
Saint Vincent and Dominica. In general terms, however, these coordinators did not have the authority to
speak on behalf of government. Critical decisions required to ensure the success of the Project were
diffused through participating agencies with no clear mechanism for getting to definitive decisions and
binding agreements. As a regional technical advisory agency, CCCCC is limited in its ability to affect
national decisions. It has to be noted, however, that once the Project was restructured, and its final scope
better defined, the implementation phase sped up significantly and the Project ultimately met its goals.

30.    Illustrations of the above mentioned issues include: (i) the development of the desalination plant
in Bequia, St. Vincent involing two basic elements; installing a plant to provide freshwater for the target
community of Paget Farm, and the installation of a renewable power generation facility to reduce

                                                     9
operation costs. In theory, this approach would generate revenue to support maintenance of the plant by
selling power back to the national grid. While in theory the idea is excellent and technically sound,
missing from the design was the inclusion of a mechanism to ensure that the policies of the national
power company (VINLEC) would be changed to allow the purchase of excess power. Additionally,
binding arrangements with the national water authority (CWSA) for operation and maintenance of the
plant were also left to the implementation phase. A positive aspect to this is that the Project served as a
catalyst to start the dialogue on those issues and anticipate some of the shortcomings that will appear
when the approach is scaled up to the rest of the island and/or to other islands.

31.      Similarly, in Dominica, the Project funded the installation of a pilot irrigation system supporting
farmers engaged in alternative agriculture projects, notably greenhouse agriculture. In this case, the
Project design was focused on the contribution to agricultural alternatives without considering the
operational requirements of a community irrigation system. As irrigation is somewhat new to Dominica,
no national mechanisms exist to empower communities to get organized, operate and maintain such
systems. This requires the formation of a water association and the empowerment of the association to
charge user fees, contract for maintenance and manage water distribution within the user community.
While the pilot is contributing to help steer the dialogue in Dominica towards the organization of water
user associations, these are not yet in place due to gaps in existing regulations. These gaps have been
identified, and are currently being addressed, which has been an unintended positive aspect of the activity.

32.      Project implementation was committed to a regional agency to coordinate and carry out
infrastructure activities in sovereign countries. Whereas CCCCC has an excellent record managing
knowledge and monitoring efforts, this project was one of the first of its kind to be implemented by
CCCCC. It required the signature of contracts to perform works in sovereign countries, works that should
comply with all national requirements and regulations. The CCCCC has undertaken enormous efforts to
ensure that works followed national guidelines and requirements, and that relevant stakeholders were
involved in the decision making process.

2.2 Implementation

33.     The implementation responsibilities were identified in the Grant agreement between the CCCCC
and the Bank, whereas responsibilities assigned to participating countries (PCs) were agreed between
CCCCC and the PCs through specific Participation Agreements. While the general expectations for the
agreements were identified in the Grant Agreement, the specific activities to be included were broadly
defined while details had to be developed during the execution of the Project. This strategy of having a
wide, unspecific definition of activities at PAD level automatically required high involvement,
engagement and leadership from the implementing agency, constant on-the-ground presence, and high
convening power to bring all stakeholders to the negotiations table and agree on activities, responsibilities
and policy changes needed. This was a cumbersome undertaking for a relatively young and small
implementing agency.

34.      As required under the Grant Agreement, Project coordinators were to be appointed for each
participating country to serve as the national focal point and the national counterpart to the CCCCC.
Additionally individual countries were to provide direct financial support. Third party financing was also
included under the Grant Agreement to be managed by the CCCCC. Specifically these included:
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) agreed to provide assistance in the form of an in-
kind contribution to assist in the financing of Component 3 of the Project; the Meteorological Research
Institute of Japan (MRI) agreed to provide assistance in the form of an in-kind contribution; and the
Government of Italy agreed to a grant in an amount equivalent to US$320,000 to assist in the financing of
the operation and management by the CCCCC.


                                                     10
35.     As the implementation agency, CCCCC was charged with the operational management of the
Project to include procurement, financial management, supervision and reporting as well as providing
direct technical assistance to the PCs for development and implementation support. Bank activities
included primarily regular supervision missions to the PCs, coordination amongst actors and technical
support to CCCCC and country teams. The structure of the Project and the involvement of multiple
agencies in each country resulted in an implementation process that was overly complex, tremendously
time consuming and created, in some cases, in significant implementation delays. Given the diverse
nature of the Project activities both technically and geographically, it is clear that the Project was under-
funded with respect to implementation and supervision requirements. Moreover, the supervision budget
for CCCCC was only based on a percentage of grant value. This budget was also supposed to provide for
fiduciary support, external audits and other related expenditures. Given the small size of the grant, funds
allocated did not reflect the level of effort required to run a project in three countries over a 5 year period.

Issues Encountered During Execution

36.      Project Organization: While technically experienced in funds management and contract
execution, CCCCC encountered difficulties with the country counterparts early in Project implementation
largely related to the organization and management of the Project. Weaknesses became apparent early in
the process notably with the technical management team provided by CCCCC and the requirement to
operate through a system of country project coordinators. These required political negotiations with the
respective countries to ensure effective project coordinators were appointed. The diffusion of authority
between the participating country agencies, Project coordinators and CCCCC created a significant
impediment to implementation as no central point of authority at the national level was available to make
decisions with respect to specific interventions or implementation activities on the ground. This lack of
clear decision authority was particularly problematic in St. Vincent and Dominica. In St. Lucia, the
problem was no less significant but was generally overcome due to the management skills of the
coordinator and the participation of government agencies not originally involved in Project design. With
respect to CCCCC, as a regional agency their strengths relate to funds management and general technical
assistance on a macro scale. The management team selected to oversee the Project lacked the technical
support required to implement specific activities at the country level. Additionally, with much of the
operational responsibility placed on the national coordinators, CCCCC's ability to directly influence
implementation and decisions was limited, affecting the efficiency of Project execution.

37.     Technical Capacity: Technical capacity was challenging both with respect to CCCCC and
country level support. With respect to CCCCC, this Project represented a departure from the type of
project they have managed in the past. SPACC required significant technical support and CCCCC
encountered difficulties in assembling an appropriate team to manage this aspect of the Project, especially
given the reduced level of funding for Project management. Agencies involved on behalf of the PCs
lacked the technical competency needed for Project execution. This hardship was identified by the Bank,
and management teams responded by providing significant technical assistance to client countries to
assist with Project execution. These difficulties carried additional project management costs not
envisioned in Project design. As a result, CCCCC needed to identify additional funding resources to cover
these increased technical assistance costs.

38.      Inappropriate levels of funding: The Project initially included US$200,000 to conduct
identification, evaluation, selection and design of adaptation measures (Component 1). However, these
tasks required greater levels of effort, including frequent trips by CCCCC from Belize to the PCs. The
Project required highly specialized studies with participation of cutting-edge institutions, such as the
hurricane wind study, performed for Saint Lucia, or the preparation of specialized designs and technical
specifications for the desalination plant and alternative power generation in St. Vincent. Resources
allocated to these tasks were insufficient, and a restructuring had to be done to reallocate more resources

                                                      11
from elsewhere. Regarding the actual on-the-ground pilot projects, the budget initially allocated was
US$1.5M. Unfortunately, there was no consideration for design requirements or how those resources
would be distributed amongst the PCs. Seven pilot projects were supposed to be financed with those
funds, but it became clear that significantly more resources were needed.

39.      Financial crisis affected some programmed activities: The international financial crisis impacted
some of the planned activities. The PCs, who were largely dependent on tourism, were significantly
impacted, and as a result, failed to provide their expected counterpart funding. To promote continued
country participation and to comply with requirements for country contributions, the Project was
restructured to include the provision of in-kind contributions. The IUCN, whose contribution under
component 3 was essential to lead, coordinate and execute the different activities of this component,
suffered some financial hardships that forced them to withdraw from the Project. This component was
downscaled to a smaller but still useful number of activities. In St. Vincent, the Government‟s
contribution was focused on financing the water distribution system at the Paget Farm community, while
the Project would finance the desalination plant and the sustainable energy source. This was reflected in a
memorandum of understanding between CCCCC and the Government, and at some point, cash sources
were actually inscribed in the national budget for this purpose. However, this contribution never
materialized and, up to date, the CCCCC has had to find additional sources of funds to cover the shortfall.
With these new funds, the main pipes and connections would be financed, while household service
connections are to be financed through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
project that is currently (May 2012) being prepared.

40.      Procurement issues: Challenges, arising from the regional nature of the Project, hindered several
Project activities. In particular, the two pilots in St. Lucia required co-financing. In the case of the
Castries pilot, co-financing was between the Project and the government of St Lucia. For the Vieux Fort
rainwater pilot, the agreement was between CCCCC and the CCBRAS resort. For the retrofitting activity
in Castries, the initial intention was to hire a single contractor to perform the retrofitting of the Marchand
Building and finance the contract with Project and Government resources. During execution, it was
discovered that by law, all Government procurement activities had to comply with national procurement
regulations and pass through the St. Lucia Central Tenders Board, while Project procurement are
processed following Bank guidelines and through the CCCCC in Belize. This created a situation that was
not foreseen, and was resolved by splitting the construction contract into two contracts, to be financed by
the government and the CCCCC. The arrangement worked, but imposed significantly higher supervision
and management challenges. This was only overcome thanks to the zeal with which institutions in St.
Lucia participated and the engagement of a motivated and cooperative contractor. For the case of Vieux-
Fort, the issue was less complicated. The private sector counterpart had no difficulty in transferring their
contribution to CCCCC in order to sign a single contract. However, as a private sector project partnership,
an atypical financial agreement had to be crafted and cleared by the Bank and CCCCC lawyers in order to
specify liabilities and provide for the need of extra cash should contingencies arise.

41.     Project delays: Owing to complexities in the design of project management and implementation
arrangements, significant delays were experienced during execution. These related primarily to: (i) lack of
clear decision authorities in implementing countries; (ii) lack of country technical capacity; (iii) limited
budget and thus limited technical support on the CCCCC management team; and, (iv) elements requiring
national policy and land acquisition issues that had to be resolved prior to execution.

42.      Project closing date extension: Given the delays noted above, the Project would have benefited
from a one-year extension. This would have allowed sufficient time to finalize all activities and have
longer monitoring periods. The possibility was discussed; however, SPACC was a regional Project that
requires high levels of supervision and travel, with higher than normal supervision costs. By the time of
the restructuring, the resources allocated to CCCCC‟s Project management (component 4), were already

                                                     12
reduced, and were not sufficient to ensure a full extra year of implementation. For this reason, a six-
month extension was agreed and approved.

Project Execution and Re-Structuring

43.       At the MTR, a range of issues were identified that needed a restructuring of the Project in order to
facilitate its success. The main changes introduced through the restructuring were: (i) modification of the
Project description to scale down component 2 to reduce the number of proposed pilots from seven to five
by removing the pilots in Spring Village and Union Island (St. Vincent and the Grenadines), and
component 3 to remove the technical assistance support that was going to be provided by the IUCN; (ii)
modifications of the outcome indicators to more accurately reflect the Project‟s objectives and the nature
of the proposed interventions; (iii) modification of the financing plan to close the financing gap created by
changes in the co-financing resources; (iv) reallocation of the proceeds of the GEF Grant to correct for
extra costs needed in component 1 and savings generated in component 3; and (v) a six-month extension
of the closing date of the Project. (See Annex 2 for detailed restructured Outcome Indicators, Activities,
Costs and Financing)


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

44.      Reporting, monitoring and evaluation included World Bank supervision, which was typically
undertaken together with the implementing agency, CCCCC; quarterly IUFRs (Interim Unaudited
Financial Reports) including financial reports and procurement plans; annual work plans and reports; a
mid-term review (MTR) conducted jointly by World Bank and CCCCC teams; and the conduct of annual
audits. Regular audio-conferences between CCCCC, technical coordinators and Bank team took place.

45.      M&E design: The design of the M&E, as reflected in the results framework, did not always
establish clear links between the objectives, outputs and indicators. Initial monitoring was hard to perform
(for example, an indicator related to the number of nesting parrots in a Dominica National Park). Once the
Project was restructured, the indicators became easier to measure and to report to, thus allowing the
results framework to be used as the instrument to evaluate on-the-ground progress. Quantity and quality
of information varies between the three participating countries, with St. Lucia undergoing a very detailed
reporting discipline while St. Vincent and Dominica lagged behind.

46.     Implementation and utilization: As discussed above, there were changes made to the indicators,
and a fairly new results matrix was generated after the restructuring. M&E tools, however, should have
been inherently built inside each activity, and appropriate instruments for measurement, registry and
stocking of information should have been included. Their absence in several pilot activities (in some cases
due to increased costs resulting from the purchase of such tools) has prevented a more accurate and
detailed gathering of information. Moreover, due to the delays previously mentioned, many activities
concluded shortly before Project closing, and there was no time to properly test and improve the M&E
arrangements. Additionally, since there was no specific budget devoted to measuring indicators: no
detailed surveys, impact analysis or evaluation reports have thus been prepared. The Project, being pilot
in nature and regional, had reduced funds to achieve this. However, it would have benefitted from extra
resources to better document achievements and lessons learnt, and it is thus suggested to take these
considerations into account on any future similar activity.

47.     Given the delays in some activities, data collected so far is not completely representative (for
example, the Bequia desalination plant, photovoltaic system, or the St. Lucia rain water harvesting
system) have been operating for less than 6 months, mostly during the dry season, and it has not been
possible to thus fully assess all benefits gained. As mentioned earlier, the initial intention was to seek a

                                                     13
one-year extension of closing date to allow for a period long enough to collect data and refine monitoring
aspects, however due to reduced Project management and supervision costs, this option was not feasible.
It would be beneficial to evaluate some of the achievements of SPACC in one to two years‟ time, to help
provide key lessons useful for regional development.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

    A. Safeguards

48.     The Project was initially categorized as category B, with minor environmental impacts from on
the ground investments. This environmental category has remained unchanged. The original safeguard
policies triggered by the Project were Environmental Assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and Natural Habitats
(OP/BP 4.04). The Project complied with both safeguard policies.

49.       Environmental Assessment: The Project was rated as an Environmental Assessment Category “B?
based on the fact that most of the activities had low or no environmental impact, were small in scale and
narrow in scope. Appropriate environmental management plans were prepared for: (i) the works of the
retro-fitting of the Marchand building in St. Lucia; (ii) the construction of the rain water harvesting
infrastructure at the roof of a hotel, construction of two small deposits for the rain water, and construction
of a treated-waste water tank for irrigation system in St. Lucia; (iii) small construction works for the water
intake and piped-water distribution in the agricultural demonstration pilot of Dominica. A simplified
Environmental Impact Assessment was prepared for the desalination and photovoltaic energy generation
in Bequia. The assessment concluded that, given the small size of the plant and the fact that it would be
operative 12-14 hours out of 24, the brine discharge was readily dispersed by the sea currents in the area.
The construction of the distribution system also followed basic construction impact mitigation guidelines.

50.      Social considerations: During the first phases of the Project in Bequia a wind turbine was
envisaged as the renewable energy source. A plot of land needed to be acquired, and an access road
needed to be built. Moreover, the water distribution tank contemplated the installation of a reservoir on
top of the hill at the Paget Farms area in Bequia and the access tank also required some land to be
acquired. A Bank social scientist visited Bequia to review the land issues, and highlighted the following:
(i) the civil works and the purchase of land would require neither the physical relocation of affected
people, nor the replacement of assets; (ii) in the private lands that are required for Project facilities there
are no crops, forest or anything that merits compensation beyond the agreements that will be reached for
selling or swapping the lands; and (iii) the local people are eager to have the Project done and have
participated in providing free labor for the civil works. As a result, the specialist concluded that no social
safeguards needed to be triggered. Moreover, the wind turbine was dropped from the Project, and only a
small portion of land, belonging to a private family, has been acquired by the government through a
voluntary agreement with the owner.

    B. Financial Management

51.    Staffing and FM System: Throughout the Project life the CCCCC was staffed with a seasoned
Finance Professional with no turn over. QuickBooks was used as the automated financial management
information system, which was able to adequately record and report Project transactions.

52.     Monitoring Reports: The CCCCC submitted the Project Integrated Unaudited Financial Reports
(IUFRs) on time. Submission delays at completion stage are understandable, since the Finance Unit
needs to include all aspects for an orderly close of Project books and accounts, outstanding debts and
refunding Closing of DA, including final documentation of expenditures and refund of any outstanding

                                                      14
balances during the grace period. The financial reports were complete and its figures reconciled with
Bank records. It is useful to underscore that, instead of submitting IUFRs semi-annually as indicated in
the Agreement, CCCCC opted for preparing and submitting them on a quarterly basis, a clear indication
that the Centre valued this management tool for making sound and informed decisions.

53.      Annual Audits: The Project audit reports for all fiscal years were performed in accordance with
International Auditing Standards. They all resulted in unqualified (clean) opinions on the financial
statements. The special opinion related to the internal controls and to the compliance with Agreement
terms, rules and regulations is also clean. There have been some instances highlighted as areas for
improvement, in order to achieve a more robust internal control environment. The Project management
promptly acted upon those highlighted areas, and the Bank team followed up and assisted as needed, until
all of the instances were resolved and closed. The joint due diligence and care yielded good results and
were evidenced in the subsequent audit reports, none of which included recurrent items.

54.      FM Implementation Support Mission: The final external audit report as of Project Closing Date
started rather late. CCCCC had doubts with the period to be audited and its financing source. Once
clarified, the audit expeditiously kicked-off, the audit firm performed their field work, and the report has
been received and approved by the Bank. It has to be mentioned that the financial reports have been
completed and its figures reconciled with Bank records, although, at Project inception, transactions and
record keeping required some fine tuning to properly report on the in-kind counterpart contribution from
participating countries and CCCCC. It is very clear that the implementing entity (CCCCC), during the life
of the Project, has been able to offer reasonable assurance that funds were used for the purpose intended,
and that they were properly accounted for.

    C. Procurement

55.     Procurement capacity: Procurement activities were carried out by CCCCC. The procurement
function as assessed at appraisal was carried out by a part-time procurement officer from SIF and a
seconded staff from the Government of Belize both received one-on-one Bank procurement training in
2007. The Procurement Office hired later for the implementation of the Project also attended the fiduciary
workshop in 2009, but resigned. The absence of a Procurement Officer lasted at the peak time of the
Project implementation, and the contract administration responsibility had to be left to the Project
Manager. The weak procurement capacity delayed new procurement activities to certain extent, though
the required procurement capacity was rebuilt for completing the Project.

56.     The procurement plan (PP) and compliance: CCCCC was updating PP periodically which were
assessed by the Bank procurement specialists and were found to be acceptable. Procurement processes are
in compliance with the loan agreement, procurement guidelines and agreed procurement plans.

57.     Two International Competitive Bids (Wind Turbine, and GPD SWRO Plant in Bequia): The
bidding documents were prepared by consulting firms. Bank Guidelines and procedures including SBDs
were followed by CCCCC and each step of the tendering processes was closely monitored by the Bank
team.

58.     Ex-post procurement reviews: Procurement reviews of the signed contracts were conducted by
the Bank‟s procurement specialist during missions. Most of the time, the Bank recommendations were
followed by the implementing agency in a timely manner and the procurement process improved after the
review.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

59.      The scope of the project was to pilot solutions that would eventually increase awareness, the
knowledge base of the PCs and provide experience and lessons to be gradually mainstreamed into
programs and plans at national and regional adaptation initiatives, such as the Pilot Program for Climate
Resilience (PPCR) under the Strategic Climate Fund of the Climate Investment Funds. The PPCR project,
recently launched in the region, is the adequate instrument to replicate lessons learnt in projects such as
the SPACC. The PPCR, developed in part with the same institutions involved in SPACC, has included
results and experiences of the latter, and aims to replicate some of the most meaningful ones, as already
reflected in PPCR project documents.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

60.      Relevance of objectives: Project development and global objectives remain highly relevant. The
PDO supported the efforts of the PCs to implement specific pilot adaptation measures that primarily
addressed the impacts of climate change on their natural resource base, with a focus on biodiversity and
land degradation. The intended global benefits include increased resilience of ecosystems to adapt to
climate change, which would contribute to the reduction of biodiversity loss in national parks and
reduction of land degradation. By focusing on addressing primarily vulnerabilities of ecosystems to
impacts of CC, the Project has shown some examples on how adaptation planning and assessment can be
translated into national policy and sustainable development planning, and how country-driven activities
can be integrated into national sustainable development and poverty-reduction strategies, while
contributing to higher-level objectives.

61.      In terms of the Bank‟s assistance strategy, the Project‟s objective remains strategically aligned
with the Bank‟s climate change adaptation work in the region. The SPACC project was a natural
continuation of the Caribbean Planning for Adaptation to Climate Change (CPACC) and the
Mainstreaming Adaptation to Climate Change in the Caribbean (MACC) projects aimed at consolidating
awareness on CC to create a knowledge base supported by testing actual feasible adaptation measures.
The scope of CPACC was to build awareness on CC and to strengthening the knowledge base, whereas
the following project (MACC) focused on creating the enabling environment for adaptation to climate
change, by developing national policy frameworks. In fact CPACC and MACC were Stage I and Stage II
adaptation projects as defined by UNFCCC (providing assistance and capacity-building efforts for
adaptation, and creation of the conditions and framework needed to take action), and SPACC was the first
integral, regional, Stage III adaptation project in the region (Stage III adaptation being the actual
implementation of adaptation measures). In this context, SPACC has provided unique outcomes in terms
of lessons learned on how to pilot adaptation measures in coastal zones for SIDS. It has highlighted
opportunities as well as more work that needs to be done.

62.     Relevance of design: The design of each pilot was relevant as there was a clear linkage with the
global benefits described above. For example, sustainability of water resources was the key
environmental issue as well as human, economic sustainability of these countries as identified in St.
Lucia‟s Issues Paper on Climate Change Adaptation & the Water Sector (April 2009). The pilots were
designed so as to avoid adverse consequences associated with water resources issues. As mentioned in
section 2.1 above, much of the Project design was left to the execution phase in several respects. First, the
component descriptions were general in nature and the concrete activities were largely determined after
the Project was turned over to the executing agency. In retrospect, in all participating Islands, Project
design should have involved the Ministries of Finance to ensure adequate support for policy related
decisions. Second, the Project was intended to support the efforts made by the PCs to implement specific

                                                     16
pilot adaptation measures addressing primarily, the impacts of climate change. This included the detailed
design of pilot adaptation measures to reduce expected negative impacts of climate change on marine and
terrestrial biodiversity and land degradation. Third, the Project design involved the preparation of
management plans in each PC, but the lack of specificity led to the build-up of expectations amongst
stakeholders that could not be covered with the available funding, creating significant delays as most of
the time during Project implementation was devoted to agreeing on final designs.

63.     Relevance of Project implementation: The relevance of Project implementation lays primarily on
the development of harmonized policy, legislation and institutional framework to support the
implementation of pilot adaptation investments intended to address the impacts of climate change on the
natural resources base of the participating countries. Reducing these impacts would create economic
benefits in the tourism, fisheries, agriculture and forestry sectors; help maintain the resource base on
which these economic activities rely; and, promote climate resilient sustainable development. The choice
of the CCCCC as the implementing agency responded to its excellent record in managing knowledge and
monitoring efforts. However, as this was one of the first projects of this kind to be managed by the
CCCCC, requiring contracts to perform works in three sovereign countries, several procurement and
supervision issues that had not been properly addressed at the design phase, resulted in Project
implementation delays and inefficiencies.

3.2 Achievement of Global Environmental Objectives

64.     Project objectives were achieved to a large extent. The achievements are evidenced by the
successful attainment of the majority of the outcome indicators. Of the fifteen outcome indicators, twelve
were achieved satisfactorily and only three indicators were partially achieved (see Annex 4).

                                           and designing adaptation operations in other countries. For example,
                                           SPACC has been fundamental in the choice of countries for the PPCR
                                           Project, which can be seen as a scale-up activity in the region bringing
                                           significant additional resources to work on adaptation to climate change.
                                           PPCR has chosen the three SPACC countries, together with a few others,
                                           and is using lessons and experiences to design its own activities. The first
                                           approved PPCR project documents capture SPACC's activities and
                                           commit to scale up some of the more significant ones. SPACC and now
                                           PPCR have also leveraged additional funds, for the Regional Disaster
                                           Vulnerability Reduction Project (US$20.92 million) financed by PPCR

3.3 Efficiency

65.      As required for a GEF Project, an incremental cost analysis was done at appraisal. The Project
objective was to support efforts by the participating countries to implement specific pilot adaptation
measures addressing the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and land degradation. Therefore, the
Project components were designed to cover all necessary steps for effective preparation for climate
change adaptation, comprising: the evaluation design and selection of adaptation measures (component 1),
the implementation of pilot adaptation measures covering the main impacts of climate change (component
2), the institutional arrangement necessary to effectively respond to the multilateral environmental
commitments (component 3) and the Project Management (component 4). The Project also tried to
produce knowledge of global value on how to implement adaptation measures in SIDS that can be applied
in other countries in the region and even for islands in other regions of the world.

66.      The restructuring of the project addressed the implementation constraints improving efficiency. In
effect, the restructuring contributed to redirect financial resources across components to cope with
increased costs arising from the design of the pilots and to include the reduction of financial contributions
of donors and beneficiary countries. In terms of cost-effectiveness of the measures piloted, it is worth
mentioning the case of the pilot in Bequia, a small island in the Grenadines, with few/no surface running
water and few/unknown underground water deposits. Paget Farms, where the desalination plant is being
operated, had no water distribution system at all and inhabitants had to collect rain water and store it in
large underground deposits that at times account for 1/3 of the total cost of the house. The costs
associated with this were extremely high and the desalinized water abates them significantly.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.      The overall outcomes are rated as moderately satisfactory. The PDO/GEO remains highly
relevant, and has been achieved through the Project activities. The Project Development Objective (PDO)
was to support efforts by the participating countries to implement specific pilot adaptation measures
addressing primarily, the impacts of climate change on their natural resources base, focused on
biodiversity and land degradation along coastal and near-coastal areas. The Global Environment
Objective (GEO) was to produce knowledge of global value on how to implement adaptation measures in
small island states that can be applied in other countries in the region and in other islands in other parts of
the world. In addition to the climate change adaptation objective, the Project also contributed to
biodiversity conservation objectives by supporting the design and implementation of specific adaptation
measures that would enhance the resilience of vulnerable, globally-important ecosystems and biodiversity.
The design was based on international perceptions and experiences related to climate change adaptation
priorities. The Project focused on pilot activities designed to address issues on a national scale. The
blending of the two perspectives, national and regional resulted in a Project that was overly ambitious
considering the level of funding available and the complexity of implementation.

68.     On the strengths of the Project, after the mid-term review, the outcome indicators were modified
to more accurately link to the Project‟s objectives and the nature of the proposed interventions. The vast
majority of the indicators were achieved by Project closing date. The SPACC Project was fundamental in
keeping the dialogue on climate change adaptation at a national and regional level, and to leverage extra
funds for this purpose. Pilot activities have been concluded, and currently there are several attempts at
scaling them up. Should this happen, the impact generated through SPACC would be multiplied. The
capacities within CCCCC (the regional center of excellence for climate change) have also been reinforced
by the Project. Through component 3, the Project made its contributions in terms of developing a
systematic reporting framework, providing valuable feedback to other countries in the region on the
practical and institutional integration of the conventions. In the institutional area, the Project contributed

                                                     21
to strengthening the PCs‟ institutional capacity to implement Multilateral Environmental Agreements
(MEA) with an integrated and holistic approach intended to reinforce the multilateral environmental
policy in the region. In summary, the restructuring of the project after the MTR seemed quite effective
and was clearly successful in providing a positive impetus to the implementation of the project.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

69.     The Project did not have an explicit poverty objective. However, it is important to note that in the
case of Bequia, the provision of fresh water to a poor community that had no running water (Paget Farms)
is expected to generate multiple benefits, including health and reduced costs for housing through avoided
construction costs for the large water tanks built under each house, and the water pumps needed to bring
the water to the house. The irrigation pilot in Dominica was also implemented in a poor area in the Milton
community, and has engaged farmers to provide them with an improved irrigation scheme. The Project
has managed to improve the economic, social and environmental resilience to climate change at the
community level, and stir the dialogue at national level. It has also managed to protect and strengthen the
livelihoods of people and communities who depend on the ecosystem goods and services at the sites and
prevent encroachment and deterioration of surrounding ecosystems and biodiversity around the settlement
areas.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

70.      The Project has contributed to empowering people to do things together. It has had an impact on
communities attracting their collaboration and participation. In St. Lucia the Ministry of Environment is
in the process of preparing the legislation needed for requiring hotels to build rain harvesting strategies to
reduce the consumption of water, and is using lessons learnt at the Marchand building for the retrofitting
of critical infrastructure against hurricanes. In Dominica the Project has successfully promoted the
organization, aggregation and participation of private farmers into farmers associations and water users
associations. The Project also strengthened the national capacity in the PCs to implement multiple Multi-
lateral environmental agreements. The three participating countries under SPACC have to report about
the conventions on climate change, biodiversity and desertification. The reporting methods, the type of
data required and the level of detail is different for each convention, and the PCs have found themselves
struggling with the amount of data and effort needed when preparing their reports. The reduction of this
burden was originally a very thorough and comprehensive component of the project, but IUCN's
withdrawal created an impact on the planned activities. However, under these circumstances, SPACC
followed a simplified approach through which specific support was given to each of the PCs by preparing
a tool that facilitates the reporting process by identifying and sharing information common to the three
conventions.

71.     The Project directly contributed to improve National Park management in Dominica with
reviewed plans, creation of databases and provision of meteorological data, which is an essential input to
ongoing modeling and downscaling efforts. The meteorological stations installed in both National Parks
are operating and collecting a comprehensive set of meteorological parameters that are transmitted in real
time via cell phone connection. The information can be downloaded at site using a laptop or retrieved
remotely from the headquarters of the Forestry Department (which is the responsibility of parks‟
management) and from the National Meteorological Service of Dominica using a dual communication
technology. Finally, there are regional efforts to incorporate this information to better describe regional
climate variability and CC trends. The system created by the project is today a node of the Caribbean
Hydrological Cycle Observing System (CIC/CARIB-HYCOS) which is a project sponsored by WMO and
covers 11 countries. In Saint Vincent, the experience gained with the desalination plant, which was the

                                                     22
first government owned plant in the Grenadine islands, has been decisive at initiating the provision of
fresh water to the Grenadine islands. This is the first initiative of its kind on any Grenadine island. Further,
the photovoltaic panels installed (80 kW) represent the largest installation in the country, and VINLEC is
gaining crucial experience, as stated by their own managers, given current plans of the company to
support and foster photovoltaic systems in the country. A power purchase agreement, the first of its kind,
is being designed, through which VINLEC will buy the energy provided by the system.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

72.       In Saint Lucia, where supplying water to a growing population is becoming a challenge as there is
a lack of conservation measures. For the first time the private sector has been involved in the rain
harvesting initiatives. In Saint Vincent, a power purchase agreement has to be designed and implemented.
It will be the first of its kind in the country, and the government has requested Bank support on how to
craft it. In Dominica, the irrigation pilot will be operated by a water user's association. This will be the
first such association in the country, and the Project has had a positive impact on the design and
implementation of such association.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

73.     There was no formal beneficiary survey held during the Project. With respect to stakeholder
workshops, several have taken place, with the objective of sharing experiences and lessons learned during
the implementation of the different pilots. For example, under Component 3, a senior consultant, with
extensive experience in the three Rio conventions, was hired in order to define strategies to simplify and
integrate reporting procedures. The consultant travelled to the three participating countries, provided
targeted training and harmonized procedures within each country. The process culminated with a regional
workshop that took place in St. Vincent on July 13-14, 2011. As a result of the workshop a report was
produced reflecting the opinion of the participants regarding the usefulness and applicability of the report
prepared by the consultant as an operational tool. Saint Lucia has also organized a number of workshops
to showcase and disseminate the experiences gained during the implementation of its pilots. In Saint
Vincent, the renewable energy source initially selected was a wind turbine. Under this framework,
extensive surveys and several meetings took place in order to hear the opinions and feedback from the
communities surrounding the turbine. Concerns, especially related to its visual impact and the potential
noise production, were expressed by the local population. The renewable source finally chosen was solar
power, and thus these concerns ceased to exist.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

74.     Overall, the Project‟s objective remains highly relevant. Nonetheless, there is still a moderate
level of risk and this section examines the potential factors that might hinder the Project‟s PDO/GEO
outcomes from being fully achieved and maintained.

75.      Sustainability of Project investments: The Project was designed around several pilot activities
that aimed at testing and showcasing sustainable solutions to climate change impacts. The Saint Vincent
and the Grenadines pilot is a good example. The population served by the desalination plant that has been
installed by the Project on Bequia Island, had no other source of water than rainfall. With drought period
becoming apparently longer, their water supply was imperiled, and Bequia has been forced to buy large
water volumes from barge ships from mainland Saint Vincent to cover the shortages. These drought
situations have created certain levels of social disorder and have resulted in high costs for an already
strained population. The desalination plant will provide potable water taking as its input sea water, and
will be powered by a renewable energy source, photovoltaic panels, which provide more energy than that

                                                      23
demanded by the plant. This creates excess electricity that can be sold, and revenues can cover the
operation and maintenance of the setup. Solar energy also allows Bequia to have an alternative source of
power other than diesel (all of the island‟s supply was based exclusively on diesel generation), which
reduces the shocks on the local economy caused by variability of oil prices.

76.      The Saint Lucia investments in rainwater harvesting and wastewater treatment for a large hotel
facility are strengthening the sustainability of large touristic infrastructures in the Caribbean, which is
critical for the economics of the region. Through the collection, storage and use (on non-human
consumption-related purposes) of rainwater, it has been proven that a large rainwater infrastructure can
significantly reduce its consumption, reduce its intake from the water supply company and thus release a
significant quantity of potable water for other purposes. The wastewater treatment solution, based on ad-
hoc treatments followed by garden irrigation, has proven effective in both reducing organic loads into
natural areas and also creating a benefit for the touristic industry, thus ensuring its replication and
maintenance.

77.    Dominica‟s activities combined represent an approach to ensure greater sustainability of its
National Parks, which were threatened by anthropogenic encroachment of farmers as well as by climate
change impacts. The new irrigation system improves agricultural output within each farm, and prevents
farmers from abandoning their areas and thus their moves into the Parks. The knowledge activities
(meteorological stations, Park management plans, databases) are targeted at mainstreaming climate
change considerations into Government‟s actions and decisions.

78.      Macroeconomic and Fiscal Vulnerability: Overarching macroeconomic and fiscal vulnerability
remains a key risk in all participating countries. Project resources were committed at the time of appraisal
but implementation of the Project proved to be complex and ambitious given the funds available. The
Small Island Developing States (SIDS) economies remain highly vulnerable to external fluctuations and
natural hazards. In effect, the capacity issues, financial weaknesses and implementation risks were
identified at the time of the appraisal to a great extent. However, it was not anticipated how badly the
2008-09 financial crises and the decline of the US and European economies would affect tourism in the
small OECS island countries and productive activities, and the long-term impacts thereof.

79.      Mainstreaming climate change issues in the productive sector is not always a priority:
Despite the adoption of the integrated ecosystem approach that highlights the benefits accruing to the
islands and given the priority of the selected pilot sites, it is possible that policy makers will not give
enough attention to the issue. However, part of CCCCC‟s mandate is to ensure that the linkage between
climate and policy remains at the center of discussions on climate change. The CCCCC will continue to
be involved in the process of mainstreaming of climate issues into policy. Furthermore, the upcoming
PPCR Project will also ensure that the climate change dialogue is maintained, with a special focus on
disaster risk management and reduction. This approach is very relevant on a region prone to natural
disasters, and is seen as a way to increase interest and engagement from Governments.

80.      Management capabilities and technical competency: The Project provided sustainable training
and resources for materials related to climate change activities, but more attention has to be paid to
management capabilities and technical competency in the agencies involved in the implementation, which
are critical to the sustainability of outcomes and benefits development. Technical staff from the ministries
involved in the pilots suffered from changes in governments, which in turn affected the staff in the
appropriate institutions involved in the Project activities. During the implementation of the Project,
technical capacity proved to be a challenge, both with respect to CCCCC and at country level. In the
future significant technical support would be required from the implementing agency and the counterparts
at the country level.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

81.     Project preparation and design followed Bank guidelines and was based on previous experiences
gained from MACC, CPACC and other related programs. However certain shortcomings including: lack
of specific detailed pilot activities; lack of clear national counterparts with the experience to ensure proper
execution at the local level; and an implementing agency that did not have enough control mechanisms to
coordinate activities in sovereign countries, led to the restructuring of the Project after the mid-term
review. During Project execution the organization and management with country counterparts proved to
lack clear decision authority, particularly in the case of St. Vincent and Dominica. As in the case of St.
Lucia, the problem was generally overcome due to the management skills of the Project coordinator.
Technical capacity was challenging both with respect to CCCCC and country level support; and the level
of funding proved to be insufficient, in part due to the international financial crisis that affected some of
planned activities.

82.      However, this was one of the first Projects with real on-the-ground investments, actions and pilot
interventions. At the time of Project design, plenty of the information needed to undertake these
investments was still unknown, and there was no previous experience on climate change adaptation
investments on infrastructure in the region. Even with these constraints, there was a continued
commitment from the GEF and the Bank to finance interventions that have helped put an emphasis on the
importance of adapting to climate change, focusing on the natural resources base of the islands and
extracting lessons for similar investments elsewhere. In this respect, SPACC has been an innovative
Project that has been able to complete most of the activities it was set out to do.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

83.      Overall the Bank supervision throughout the life of the Project was moderately satisfactory. The
Bank conducted regular supervision missions to the participating countries focusing primarily, throughout
the period of the implementation of the Project, on progress towards results. During the first four years of
the Project implementation, the missions concentrated on the original eight monitoring indicators. After
the restructuring of the Project in September 2010, the missions focused on progress made towards results
of the fifteen monitoring indicators. The new indicators brought value to the Project, since they helped
frame the outcomes, concretize activities, and improve supervision and monitoring. Bank activities also
included coordination amongst actors and technical support to CCCCC during Project implementation.

84.      Responsiveness to implementation problems was slow at first. Especially in the first four years of
the Project, Bank responsiveness to implementation constraints was sluggish. Supervision missions
identified problems such as: complex implementation process consuming a lot of time, resulting in delays
in execution and implementation; under-funding with respect to implementation and supervision
requirements given the diverse nature of the Project activities (technically and geographically); and the
small size of the Grant, where the allocation of funds does not reflect the level of effort required to run a
technical Project in three countries over a five year period. The financing difficulties of the Project did not
come all at once, and it became challenging to take a decision on which activities to maintain and which
ones to reduce. Once the full picture was clear, the team conducted an in-depth mid-term review, the
Project was then restructured, and disbursements increased significantly afterwards. This led to the
project being able to achieve most of its goals. During this time, the Bank team coordinated with multiple
phone calls, videoconferences and missions.


                                                      25
85.      There were delays falling outside the Project’s capacity to respond. These related primarily to the
lack of clear decision making structures in participating countries and reduced technical capacity, and
most importantly, to elements requiring national policy and land acquisition issues that had to be resolved
prior to execution.

86.      Supervision was responsive to Project issues: Despite the fact that the Bank team‟s continuity and
regularity of missions were somewhat affected by the change in staffing, including task managers over the
Project life, a successful restructuring was conducted, and changes were introduced towards
implementation success. The Project achieved substantial progress in all components, partially due to the
conclusion of designs and quick transition towards procurement and execution. Following the MTR the
ISRs include a reasonably good description of issues and progress, also detailed in Aide Memoires,
particularly the one of August 2011 where there is a full analysis of the overall status of Project activities
in each one of the participating countries and a discussion of an action plan to finalize Project activities by
December 2011.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

87.    Overall Bank Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory based on similar ratings for Bank
performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry and in Quality of Supervision.

88.      The Bank effort applied to this Project in the initial preparation process was considerable. Much
of the Project design was based on international perceptions relating to climate change adaptation
activities. The Project objectives were highly relevant to the Region and focused on pilot activities
designed to address issues on a national scale. At the supervision level, initial slow Bank responsiveness
to addressing implementation delays in several activities was compensated by the changes introduced
after the MTR, improving implementation progress; and the six month Project extension was instrumental
in helping to complete all activities. The SPACC Project not only had the difficulties of being the first of
its kind implementing on-the-ground adaptation to climate change investments, but it also suffered from
the natural hardships of a regional Project, involving multiple counterparts, stakeholders, agencies and
beneficiaries. These two features require very intense supervision and follow-up, challenging task given
the overall funding available for the Project. Despite these difficulties, the Project managed to deliver in
most fronts, and has proven to be a valid tool to strengthen the dialogue in the region and leverage more
funds and initiatives such as the PPCR. For these reasons, the Bank‟s overall performance is rated as
moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower

89.     The Borrower for this Project is CCCCC, which implemented activities in the name of and on
behalf of the three participating countries.

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

90.     In the case of St. Lucia the rating is satisfactory. The country maintained a national technical
coordinator throughout the life of the Project, and the national government was engaged and committed.
The engagement with Dominica can be seen in two stages. During the first years of Project
implementation, the main focal point was the Environmental Coordinating Unit within the Ministry of
Environment. During this time, the Project lacked a clear focus and progress was slow. In early 2010, the
CCCCC hired a consultant who was sent to Dominica in order to expedite activities. The consultant
proactively engaged with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, which committed to implement

                                                      26
activities, appointed a focal person to manage SPACC in the country, and vigorously supported the
Project. Finally, Saint Vincent and the Grenadine‟s focal point for SPACC was the Permanent Secretariat
from the Ministry of Health and the Environment. This Ministry suffered a number of staff changes, and
progress was uneven. The desalination plant pilot encountered a number of complications, especially
during the time when the wind turbine was explored as the first option (acquisition of lands required,
construction of an access road etc) which slowed down progress. Some of these complications fell beyond
the attributions of the Ministry, and the Project suffered delays. Once the final decision on photovoltaic
power was taken, and the procurement processes started, all country agencies came on board and
activities accelerated considerably.

91.      Main overall shortcomings, which can be seen as lessons learnt, are: (i) At the Project preparation
stage the main problem was the reliance on a regional executing agency without clear national
counterparts empowered with the knowledge and experience to ensure proper execution at the local level;
(ii) At the implementation stage, although the Grant Agreement established that participating countries
should provide resources for national coordination, this did not occur mainly due to the international
financial crisis, with the exception of Saint Lucia. With respect to critical decisions required to ensure the
success of the Project, the participating agencies had no clear mechanism for arriving at definitive
decisions and binding agreements; and (iii) several of the Project activities imply infrastructure
interventions, and the focal points chosen for SPACC not always have the attributions to mandate and
coordinate works. This in turn created some level of detachment from Project activities, especially during
the first years of implementation. Government involvement and commitment however increased as soon
as goods and works contracted by the Project started to become a reality.

92.     All Ministries of the three countries participating in SPACC, all incumbent agencies,
meteorological services and other bodies that needed to play a role for Project implementation, were
responsive and made time and resources available for Project completion, as demonstrated by the
engagement of entities, VINLEC and CWSA, energy and water supply authorities of Saint Vincent.
Overall government commitment was critical to ensure appropriate Project completion; and this
commitment continues after Project closure, as demonstrated by the wide engagement of the three
countries with the PPCR project.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

93.      The implementing agency for this Project was the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre.
The implementation responsibilities were identified in the Grant agreement between the CCCCC and the
Bank, while responsibilities assigned to participating countries were agreed to between CCCCC and the
countries through specific Participation Agreements. The expected results as well as the specific activities
were identified and broadly defined in the Grant Agreement, while the specific details were left to be
developed during the execution of the Project. This process involved a screening procedure for the
identification and selection of specific interventions requiring high involvement, engagement and
leadership from the implementing agency, almost permanent presence in the field, and high convening
power to bring all stakeholders to the negotiations table and agree on activities, responsibilities and policy
changes needed. This proved to be a burdensome undertaking for a relatively young and small
implementing agency.

94.     Additionally, as required under the Grant Agreement, individual countries were to provide direct
financial support. The level of support was identified in the Grant Agreement and the expectation was that
in addition to a national coordinator, countries would provide financial resources. Despite these efforts
during the restructuring of the Project to allow for in-kind contributions, the fact remained, with the
exception of Dominica, that the lack of direct national financing into activities prevented a higher sense of

                                                     27
ownership to develop, which played against Project agility and more efficient implementation. The
CCCCC made remarkable efforts to step up and cover financial shortages, and was proactive in
identifying a new, experienced project manager for SPACC who accelerated the pace of implementation
and improved coordination efforts. It has to be noted that most of the activities have been completed
despite the numerous challenges, and this has been possible to great extent thanks to the continuous
commitment of CCCCC with the Project and its determination to achieve appropriate implementation.

95.      The assessment of the “Borrower/Recipient? performance is a complex task, and while trying to
evaluate only the work done by CCCCC, this has to be seen in the context of the actual capacity and
performance of three totally different countries engaged in the implementation of totally different type of
pilots and activities.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

96.     Overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory, based on ratings for Government
Performance and Implementing Agencies‟ Performance. Certainly without sustained high level
Government commitment and support to the Project none of the achievements of the SPACC program
would have been feasible. In terms of the implementing agency, overall management of Project activities
was moderately satisfactory, with CCCCC complying with procedures; close supervision of national/
local level activities; important technical assistance to national/local entities; and timely reporting.
However, as explained earlier in this report, the Project has suffered important delays from a number of
sources and unfortunately, resources for CCCCC project management were scarce. The Project would
have likely benefited from a one-year extension, and the possibility was discussed during the restructuring
process. Unfortunately, there were not enough Project management resources left for such an extension,
and therefore a six-month extension was agreed upon and executed.

6. Lessons Learned

97.     Some lessons learned from SPACC are as follows:

98.      Early engagement of the user community: Early engagement of the user community during the
preparation of the pilot projects had a significant and positive effect on the execution of the pilot scale
activities. This participation served to maintain the visibility of the projects from the government
perspective and their early inputs aided in the design and execution of effective pilot designs. This was
particularly effective in the case of the Bequia desalination plant and the irrigation works in Dominica.

99.      Strong engagement of private sector participants: In the pilot rainwater harvesting effort on St.
Lucia, the identification and engagement of a motivated private sector partner was critical to the success
of the demonstration project. Hotel participation was robust and their contribution both in support for the
pilot as well as their willingness to engage other hotel owners provided for the successful implementation
of the conservation strategy, and turned into a vehicle for educating others in the hotel sector about the
benefits of rain-water harvesting.

100.    Selection of a motivated regional counterpart: While CCCCC was relatively inexperienced in the
management of a project of this nature, their regional presence and strong motivation to produce a
successful project was a significant factor contributing to a satisfactory project. Despite limitations of
funding for Project supervision, CCCCC used their regional presence to engage additional monies to
cover shortfalls.



                                                    28
101.      Robust institutional arrangement, documented in an operational manual, is vital to ensure
effective implementation: While regionally, CCCCC managed the operational aspects of the Project, local
counterparts consisted of multiple agencies operating through country coordinators. This organizational
structure left much of the responsibility for execution with a coordinator that had no authority to direct
agency participation. As such, the coordinator had to rely on negotiated commitments with line agencies
which varied from country to country. Absent clear lines of authority and responsibility, Project activities
suffered delays and setbacks. Notably, in the case of St. Lucia, Project activities moved well because of
private sector participation and the skill of the project coordinator with involving and motivating
participating agencies. It was noted however, that particularly in the case of the community center
retrofitting, the absence of a clear management structure empowered with appropriate authority created
challenges with the implementation of works.

102.    An institutional capacity assessment and policy framework should be the point of departure to
achieve an adequate design: Pilot projects such as the desalination plant and irrigation works in Dominica
required the development and implementation of policies and procedures that required government action,
and in some cases at the cabinet level. In St Vincent, the desalination plant design included the generation
of solar power to both run the plant and generate excess power to be sold back to the national electric
authority (VINLEC). Revenues generated from the sale of power were included in the pilot concept as a
revenue source for plant maintenance and operation. St. Vincent lacks a national policy for purchasing
excess power and such a decision requires the analysis of VINLEC„s cost structure and the development
of appropriate tariffs which require cabinet approval. At the moment, VINLEC is in the process of
designing the agreement, which will likely set the stage for future agreements in the country.

103.     Lessons learnt have been mainstreamed by each participating country. Saint Lucia has used both
pilots to shape regulations and include new requirements when building infrastructure in the country. The
experience they have gained through SPACC has been critical in informing the higher level decisions that
have been taken; Saint Vincent has also used the experience gained with SPACC to promote solar energy
in the island and gain insights on how to make this process more efficient, and they have started the
supply of fresh water to the Grenadines. One of the lessons they have extracted is the necessity to have
clear regulation on power purchase agreements for the electricity utility to buy energy off from private
producers. In Dominica, the irrigation pilot has generated lessons on how to implement infrastructure for
a community of water users, since this has been one of the first projects of its kind developed by the
Agriculture Ministry in consultation with communities. Although SPACC is a regional project, there are
lessons from adaptation to each national context and dissemination to the wider Caribbean. As such, a
lesson learnt is the need to provide more funding and efforts towards knowledge management of the
activities performed, and a coherent, integrated monitoring system with appropriate funding.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

104.    The following comments are a summary of the ICR prepared by the Implementing Agency on May
15, 2012 and provided by Mr. Earl Green, Task Manager of the SPACC within the Caribbean Community
Climate Change Centre (CCCCC).

105.     In the opinion of the CCCCC the Project objective remains valid. The link between the adverse
impacts of climate change and development has been well established, and as a result, the topic of
adaptation to climate change has become increasingly important in the regional and national agendas. The
implementing agency believes that the objective, design and implementation of the SPACC Project have
been fully consistent with the region‟s development priorities, GEF priorities and Bank country assistance
strategies. Despite constraints and issues, the SPACC has been able to achieve some successes, and has
made positive contribution to conservation and sustainable development in the participating countries.

                                                    29
106.    According to CCCCC the main Project achievements can be summarized as follows: policy
change for infrastructure development in at least one of the countries, and incorporation of climate change
adaptation measures for national parks in another; enhancement of the capacity of national parks
managers to monitor weather changes; improved livelihoods of community farmers by reducing their
vulnerability to climate variation through the installation of an irrigation system under local management;
greater protection of local residents from severe storm events through the provision of a self-contained
community centre in one PC; demonstration of effective public-private partnership in addressing a water
demand issue affecting the residents of a coastal protected area in one participating country; provision of
a renewable energy powered reliable safe potable water supply to residents of a community that
previously relied on rainwater collection; introduction of a tool to facilitate reporting and management in
the three PCs; and collaboration among different ministries in one participating country in order to
implement the pilot projects successfully.

107.     The institutional arrangements for Project coordination and implementation at national levels
were not all put in place and functioned differently in each participating country. One country, St. Lucia,
was particularly effective and exemplary in collaboration and coordination among the national institutions,
including the allocation and utilization of counterpart funds for the execution of the pilot activities. The
others demonstrated less than satisfactory support for the implementation of the pilots. With respect to
efficiency and quality, Project staff members in St. Lucia performed excellently, in SVG performance
could be rated as satisfactory, while in Dominica the lack of support of the appropriate institution was less
satisfactory.

108.     The CCCCC assessment of SPACC concluded that: (i) Project design requires some flexibility to
allow for adjustments when social and economic conditions change significantly, being critical to place
more emphasis on assessments of the social and economic benefits of natural resources management; (ii)
projects that involve a large number of actors (three donors, one regional implementing agency, three
participating countries and several governmental partners in each country) need to begin with an initial
phase that is devoted not only to Project planning, but to public relations to avoid a disconnect between
design and implementation; (iii) projects that demand significant contributions from national and local
partners should also provide alternatives for funds when unexpected events affect the countries; (iv) the
SPACC experience gained and the lessons learnt can be used in the replication of the projects at larger
scales; and (v) climate change adaptation is a long-term venture, whereas many years of continuous work
are required to ensure the sustainability of successful adaptation pilot projects.

Annex 3. Restructured Outcome Indicators, Activities, Costs and Financing.

Change in Outcome Indicators: The restructuring included the revision of indicators to demonstrate
more measurable and meaningful outcomes of pilot activities. Moreover, two outcome indicators were
dropped due to the cancelation of the two pilots in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. There were no changes
in institutional arrangements or in the financing mechanism.
Modifications to the Project Activities in St. Vincent and the Grenadines: Two of the three originally
selected pilots in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (Union Island under Subcomponent 6 of the Project, and
Spring Village under Subcomponent 7) were canceled, thus reducing the total number of project pilots
from seven to five. The number of pilots in St. Lucia and Dominica remained the same.
Project costs and financing plan: Table 1 summarizes the changes in Project costs that were included as
part of the restructuring, and Table 2 presents the Revised Financing Plan. The total Project costs were
reduced from the initial $5.44 million to $4.30 million. This reduction mainly came from: (i) a reduction
in the contribution of the Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) of Japan (initially estimated at 1.39
million) estimated at 0.6 million; (ii) the unexpected financial difficulties of the International Union for
the Conservation of Nature (leading to the cancelation of US$125,000), and (iii) decreased governments‟
co-financing, from an initial US$1,500,000 to a final US$850,000.

Reallocation of GEF resources: Participating countries‟ difficulties in allocating cash funds created the
need to partially reallocate funds from GEF. The following reallocation of GEF resources took place from
Component 2 (Implementation of the pilots) and Component 3 (Strengthening of national capacity to
implement multiple Multilateral Environmental Agreements) to Component 1 (Design of the pilots) and
Component 4 (Project management).

   Component 1: The increase in resources for this component arose from unforeseen increases needed
    for some critical design studies, especially the study related to the intensification of hurricanes and its
    impact on building codes for the Marchand building in Saint Lucia.
   Component 2: The reduction in resources for this component amounted to US$50,000 that was
    allocated to other activities. This amount was less than 5% of the total grant amount, which complied
    with Bank‟s operational policy 13.25.
   Component 3: The re-definition of this component after the withdrawal of US$125,000 from the
    International Union for the Conservation of Nature, IUCN, together with their leadership and support,
    due to their own financial crisis. The component was reduced in scope, and contracted experts and
    conducted workshops to support countries prepare a single integrated reporting framework for the
    three Rio conventions. The Project team estimated that this plan could be accomplished with
    US$75,000 and the countries agreed on this approach.

   Component 4: It was proposed that the GEF allocation for Category 4 (Project management) be
    increased by US$10,000 due to the aforementioned participating countries‟ difficulties to allocate
    cash resources for Project management and the need for more intensive coordination and management
    between the CCCCC and the national coordinators/focal points, in light of the complexity of a
    regional Project. The CCCCC also used its own resources, from allocations received from third
    parties, to meet additional costs associated to Project management.

      (1) The description of each category already includes some of the modifications presented below.

Financial management: Two financial management supervision missions were carried out as part of the
MTR (July and September 2010). They showed that financial management arrangements continued to be
adequate on the whole, and the Bank and CCCCC agreed on actions to address issues that arose from
those missions. There were no overdue audit reports.

Disbursement arrangements: The disbursement schedule was updated to reflect the delays in the
implementation of the pilots:

Procurement: Procurement under the Project was rated satisfactory.

Closing date: The mid-term review included a six-month extension of the Project. A one-year extension
was considered, but there were insufficient funds under Project management (component 4) to provide for
the extra resources that would have been needed.

Annex 5. Economic and Financial Analysis

The Project was estimated to demonstrate its economic efficiency at three levels: (a) the nature of
the project to include pilots provides efficiency because it saves learning costs, evaluates design
assumptions, and permits adjustments of the measures before its replication at a national level
was being replicated; (b) the preliminary economic analysis of a selected adaptation measure
would highlight economic benefits higher than the economic costs of implementing them, as the
experience in other adaptation pilots had provided; and, (c) the procurement procedures adopted
by the Project would favor minimum cost for significant acquisition of goods and services.

A preliminary economic analysis of selected adaptation measures was to be undertaken to
illustrate the economic efficiency of the type of adaptation measures covered by the Project. The
analysis was to assess direct economic benefits and costs associated with the adaptation measures
applying standard economic methodology. Following previous experiences it was expected that
the cost-benefit ratio for each measure will show higher economic benefits than cost in all cases.
An incremental cost analysis and an accounting of local and global benefits would also be
included. A financial analysis would be conducted as part of the selection process for site specific
adaptation measures, which would guide the decision-making process for the identification of
appropriate and economic efficient interventions.

Incremental Cost Analysis: As required for a GEF project, at appraisal, an incremental cost
analysis was used for the project‟s economic and financial analysis. The Project objective was to
support efforts by the participating countries (Dominica, Saint Lucia and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines) to implement specific pilot adaptation measures addressing the impacts of climate
change on biodiversity and land degradation along coastal and near-coastal areas. Therefore, the
Project components were designed to cover all necessary steps for effective preparation for
climate change adaptation: the evaluation design and selection of adaptation measures
(component 1), the implementation of pilot adaptation measures covering the main impacts of
climate change (component 2), the institutional arrangement necessary to effective respond to the
multilateral environmental commitments (component 3) and the Project Management (component
4). Taking into account that components 1 and 2 were closely related, and that the adaptation
measures covers different topics in the participating countries, the development goals and
baseline analysis treated both components as one but following the issues covered by the pilot
adaptation measures of component 2.

Baseline costs were identified by consulting official investment plans of the institutions included
in the Project scope and selecting specific programs and activities that relate with the ecosystem
that would be affected by global climate change. Baseline costs for subcomponent 1 and 2 were
based on Dominica National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, in particular, allocated
resources for the following projects: Integrated Land (Resource) Use Planning and Management
(USD 1.5 million), Comprehensive Water Resource Management Plan (USD 750.000) and the
Identification and Protection of Threatened Ecosystems and Species (USD 650.000); Baseline
costs for subcomponent 3 were based on the National Water Policy of Saint Lucia; and Baseline
costs for subcomponent 4 were based on the cost of the approved loan by the Caribbean
Development Bank in 2004 to finance appropriate flood mitigation measures in Castries and Anse
La Raye (USD$ 5.45 million). The total Baseline costs were estimated at US$10.81 million.

The Project was expected to provide complementary support to existing and planned (baseline)
local activities related with water availability, watershed and coastal management, National Parks
conservation, disaster managing and sustainable fishing; and was aimed to achieve global
objectives not only relating with the preparation of participating countries on adaptation measures


                                                41
to cope with the major global climate change impacts on its resources, but also to address the
inter-linkages between climate change and biodiversity and land degradation in an integrated
manner. The Project also seeks to produce knowledge of global value on how to implement
adaptation measures in small island states that can be applied in other countries in the region, not
participating in the Project and even for islands in other regions of the world. The value of these
early lessons will make the GEF resources applied, more cost-effective in the medium term. The
total incremental cost calculated at appraisal was US$5.4 million, of which US$ 2.1 million was
to be financed by the GEF.

Impact on strategic local resources as well as on strategic global resources: The main global
environmental objective was to prepare participating countries for adaptation to the main
identified global climate change impacts by assessing, selecting, designing and implementing
pilot adaptation measures, with “a learning by doing? approach. In addition to climate change
adaptation objective, the Project also would contribute to biodiversity conservation objectives by
supporting the design and implementation of specific adaptation measures that will enhance the
resilience of vulnerable, globally-important ecosystems and biodiversity. Finally, in the
institutional area, the Project would contribute to strengthening the institutional countries capacity
to implementation of MEA with an integrated and holistic approach intended to reinforce the
multilateral environmental policy in the region.
