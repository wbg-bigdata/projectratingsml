F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objective of the Project is to support the Government's program to provide basic
education and improve the quality of education for all children by 2010: (i) ensuring equity
of access to basic education; (ii) enhancing quality and learning achievement; (iii) providing
opportunities for further education and training; and (iv) strengthening education sector
management.

These objectives were all framed within the context of the Government's "Economic
Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment Creation 2003-2007" and its governance
strengthening and anti-corruption program.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The Project Development Objectives remained the same over the Kenya Education Sector
Support Program (KESSP) period, but the sources of data for three indicators, as reported in
the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs), changed from time to time due to lack of data.
See Section 3.2 for further explanation.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal1

1.       Country context. At the time KESSP was appraised, jointly by the development
partners in 2005 and later for approval of the International Development Association (IDA)
Credit during 2006/07, the economy had been improving, following a decade marked by
macroeconomic instability, rising poverty, major corruption scandals and an erosion of
confidence in public institutions, governance and the rule of law. Following elections in
2002, the Kenyan authorities had adopted an Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and
Employment Creation 2003-2007 (ERS) and had moved rapidly to restore macroeconomic
stability, liquidate domestic debt and increase resources for long-neglected development
expenditure. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth had accelerated, and the fraction of
individuals below the poverty line of KSh 2,913 a month had fallen from 53 percent in
1997 to 47 in 2006 (World Bank 2008a). Public revenue had risen; donors had begun to
return after a long absence; and the medium-term outlook was guardedly optimistic –
guarded due to risks associated with weak governance, corruption, impunity and potential
(social) risks associated with the forthcoming 2007 elections.

2.      The Government elected in 2002 had campaigned on an anti-corruption platform,
and a Governance and Anti-Corruption strategy was a core pillar of the ERS. However,
although many appropriate laws relating to public procurement and financial management
had been enacted and some progress had been made in instituting financial audits and
improving expenditure controls, implementation and enforcement lagged behind in many
areas, and corruption remained a serious risk. In 2006, detailed implementation reviews
(DIRs) were carried out in four sectors of the Bank’s portfolio in Kenya. These confirmed
corruption risks with indicators of fraud and corruption in the road, health and HIV sectors,
and additional measures were introduced to further safeguard Bank-financed operations
from corruption risks. In contrast, the DIR carried out in the education sector concluded
that "the mechanisms for community involvement, consultations, accountability,
procurement and financial management were satisfactory", while at the same time pointing
to the need for "additional safeguards… including public disclosure of performance
indicators, independent monitoring of performance and an annual independent audit of
procurement".

3.      Sector context. Access to education had fallen significantly during the 1990s for
several reasons, including particularly cost-recovery policies. In its election manifesto, the
National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) had made a bold pledge to offer Free Primary
Education to all children as part of its commitment to poverty reduction and to the
Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and Education for All (EFA) goals of Universal
Primary Education (UPE). The main component of the FPE program was the elimination
of levies and the provision of grants on a per student basis to cover the costs of

                                                     1
instructional materials and infrastructure maintenance. A pilot of the grants program,
supported by DFID, was already underway to develop and test rules, systems, processes
and procedures and was showing highly positive results. In 2003, the Kenyan authorities
began the roll out of Free Primary Education (FPE). Levies were banned in all public
primary schools; children were admitted free of charge; and the Government of Kenya
(GoK) committed itself to providing schools with a subsidy of KSh 1,020 per enrolled child
for teaching and learning materials and school operating costs.2 The GoK backed up this
commitment with resources. In FY2004/05, GoK (recurrent) expenditure on FPE school
grants had reached about KSh 7 billion (US$93 million), or about KSh 960 per student
attending a public primary school.

4.     The impact of FPE was reportedly immediate. According to the Ministry of
Education (MoE), in 2003 enrolment in public primary schools had increased by 1.4
million (1.2 million in public primary schools and 0.5 million in non-formal education
centers) to a total of 7.2 million (KESSP Project Appraisal Document). The widespread
popular response to FPE, however, also resulted in overcrowding, high pupil-teacher ratios
in some schools and severe shortage of instructional materials in many schools.

5.      The FPE policy was strongly supported and promoted by development partners as
an effective strategy to attain UPE. It also presented a unique window for development
partners to support the GoK development objectives (especially as there were few sectors
where they felt comfortable investing). Further, FPE was directly relevant to
decentralization, and to governance objectives of accountability and transparency.3 IDA
responded rapidly to support FPE with a US$50 million Credit (Free Primary Education
Support Project) which became effective in July 2003 and closed in July 2007.4 The initial
successes of FPE were well documented in a 2005 expenditure tracking survey which
pointed to high impact on the poor, effective delivery mechanisms (with 98 percent of
schools having received a grant averaging KSh 300 per child), and a high level of client
satisfaction with the program (PriceWaterhouseCoopers 2006).

6.      Building on this success, and the need to develop a plan that translated ERS
development priorities into strategies and plans, the MoE developed a sector wide policy
and strategy which was presented to Parliament as the 2005 Sessional Paper No. 1 on
Education and Training. The Kenya Education Sector Support Programme (KESSP) 2005-
2010 translated these priorities into investment programs and a comprehensive framework
for implementation, and brought various donor-funded projects under one umbrella. In
2005, development partners also adopted “Partnership Principles? for working together in
the sector. They collectively appraised the KESSP, approved bilateral funding, supported

  The per child subsidy was broken down into KSh 650 for instructional materials and KSh 370 for operating
expenditure. Schools were permitted to collect extra levies only with written permission from the MoE.
However, no child was to be sent home due to non-payment of the approved levies.
3
  FPE decentralized resources to the point of service delivery; it involved civil society stakeholders in the
management of school resources; and it required and promoted increased transparency (e.g., posting
summaries of receipts and expenditures in a visible place outside the school).
4
  The Credit supported implementation of the Instructional Materials Component of the FPE grant, Capacity
Building, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) and the development of a broader sector policy and program.

additional resource mobilization from the EFA-Fast Track Initiative (FTI) to help cover the
financing gap in the first three years (2005-2007); and established a Joint Financing
Agreement for those partners willing and able to join in a pooled fund arrangement.

7.      Governance. Strengthening Governance was a national priority that cut across all
sectors, including education. At the time of the launch of the KESSP in mid-2005, there
was a consensus that considerable achievements had been made in strengthening
accountability in the primary education sub-sector. However, it is also clear that the
education sector was still recognized as facing serious governance and corruption risks (see
Section 2.6)

8.      Rationale for Bank assistance. The Kenya Education Sector Support Program
(KESSP) was a central program of the ERS and of the Bank’s 2004 Country Assistance
Strategy. In addition to the high performance ratings of the Free Primary Education
Support Project, the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) cited the following rationale for
Bank support: (a) familiarity with the sector acquired through the Free Primary Education
Support Project and as supervising entity of the FTI grant; (b) extensive experience with
large scale education reform programs; (c) good positioning to strengthen the link between
education reform, macro-economic management and the Medium Term Expenditure
Framework and (d) the World Bank’s increased attention to governance issues. The
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) completion report of 2010 also noted that education
was the highest disbursing sector, and where outcomes had been achieved.

with contributions from GoK and development partners and governed by conditions laid
out in a Joint Financing Agreement (JFA), was developed. Development partners
participating in the pooled fund over the five-year KESSP period included IDA, EFA-FTI,
DFID, CIDA and UNICEF. Chart 1 shows the evolution of KESSP partners over time.

11.     When the International Development Association (IDA) Credit became effective in
March 2007, KESSP had been under implementation for almost two years. The Credit
financed continued implementation of the KESSP Investment Programs. The results
framework for the IDA Credit is the results framework for the overall KESSP. Since 2005
was the baseline for KESSP, progress towards the achievement of program targets is also
assessed relative to this baseline. Given that IDA financing was pooled with Government
and other development partner financing, it is not possible to attribute the financing of a
particular partner to specific inputs, outputs or outcomes.

12.   Progress towards achievement of the KESSP development objectives was to be
measured particularly by:
     The primary net enrollment ratio (NER), disaggregated by gender and province;
     The primary completion rate (PCR), disaggregated by gender;
     Learning achievement levels based on results from periodic National Surveys of
      Learning Achievement (NASLA) ;
     The transition rate from primary to secondary education; and
     Recurrent expenditure shares for primary education and, within that, the share
      allocated to non-salary expenditure.

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

13.    The PDOs remained the same over the KESSP period but the sources of data for
three key indicators, as reported in the Implementation Status Reports (ISRs), changed
from time to time due to lack of data. See Section 3.2 for further explanation.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

14.     Based on the objectives and investment program activities, the intended direct
beneficiaries of the project’s financing can be identified as: (a) primary school-aged
children, particularly the most vulnerable, who would benefit from lower out-of pocket
costs and all would benefit from having more instructional materials; (b) secondary school-
aged youth, particularly the poorest, who would benefit from increased opportunity to
attend secondary school; (c) teachers, administrators, managers, governance bodies and
technical staff at all levels of the education system, including primary school management
committees, secondary school boards of governors, and semi-autonomous Government
agencies (SAGAs), that would benefit from capacity building. The country as a whole
would also benefit in the longer term through higher productivity of the labor force, among
other benefits.




                                            4
1.5 Original Components

15.      KESSP had four “components? and 23 investment programs. These programs
reflect the strategies that Government adopted to achieve the targets set in each of the four
components. Below is a brief summary. (Annex 2(a) shows the investment programs
mapped to the respective component and program development outcomes; Annex 11
provides a full description of each component taken from the PAD).

16.     Ensuring equitable access to basic education (US$ 154.0 million, 12 percent of
total). The investment programs to achieve this objective aimed at reducing disparities in
education opportunity due to wealth, geographic location and gender. They addressed both
supply and demand side constraints to equitable access including: (a) continuation of the
successful FPE school grant program; (b) expanded programs to address access constraints
of children with special needs, children in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) areas and
informal settlements, girls and adults; and (c) a school infrastructure program targeted to
the neediest communities, with a specific focus on water and sanitation.

17.     Enhancing quality and learning achievement (US$735.0 million, 54 percent of
total). At the primary level, the strategy to achieve higher learning outcomes was to ensure
that a set of essential learning materials was available to every child; instructional materials
were effectively utilized; learning was the central focus in the classroom; learning progress
was regularly measured; children were more ready to learn; and the quality of schooling
was effectively monitored and supported. The main investment programs supporting these
objectives included: (a) FPE instructional materials grants for primary students, (b) grants
to early childhood development centers; (c) primary school feeding, health and nutrition
programs targeted to the most vulnerable; and (d) at the secondary level, scaling-up a
successful math and science teacher in-service education program in partnership with
Japan.

18.     Providing opportunities for further education and training (US$389.0 million,
29 percent of total). The main strategies under this component aimed to expand
opportunities for post-primary education, particularly to secondary education and to
populations with low access and incomes insufficient to afford the cost of secondary
education. The investment programs for these levels of education foresaw the preparation
of strategies for secondary, Technical, Industrial, Vocational Education and Training
(TIVET) and post-secondary education as a first step, while investing some resources in
expanding day secondary education and providing bursaries to needy students until the
strategies were completed.

19.     Strengthening sector management (US$76.3 million, 6 percent of total cost).
The objective of this component was to strengthen capacity of implementation and policy
support systems. The corresponding investment programs focused principally on: (a)
teacher management; (b) strengthening the MoE’s Education Management Information
System (EMIS) to provide reliable and timely data; (c) training of all stakeholders involved
in the management of school infrastructure grants, FPE grants and other student subsidies;
(d) process monitoring and impact evaluation; and (e) HIV/AIDS.

                                               5
20.     Across the four components, and relative to the KESSP financial framework,
increasing opportunities for all children to attend and complete a quality primary education
was the main priority, comprising over 60 percent of KESSP’s estimated total cost of
US$1.4 billion for the five-year period 2005-2010. (Project costs and financing are in
Annex 1).

1.6 Revised Components

21.    No component was formally revised.

1.7 Other Significant Factors

22.    Suspension of disbursements. IDA financing for KESSP was active for only about
30 months of the 45 month duration of the Credit. Due to emerging evidence of fraud and
corruption, IDA replenishments were effectively suspended from July 2009 through to
December 2010 when the credit closed. Project implementation was fundamentally affected
by the post-election violence which started in January 2008, and the suspension of
disbursements.

23.     Design, scope and scale. KESSP review processes were set up to provide
flexibility to expand the Program as MoE developed strategies for secondary and other
levels of education (agreed with development partners), and to adjust allocations annually
across investment programs IPs depending on implementation. However, in 2007/08 GoK
announced, and began implementing, a policy of Free Secondary Education which
eliminated tuition fees initially in public day secondary schools and provided a per student
subsidy of KSh 10,265. The policy was soon scaled up to encompass all public secondary
schools, including boarding schools where the per student subsidy was much higher. The
implementation of the policy significantly increased the scale of the secondary education
program and taxed overall MoE implementation and financial management capacity (see
section 2.2).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

24.     Relevance. The KESSP was relevant to the development objectives set out in the
Government’s national development and poverty reduction strategies. As a medium-term
plan for the sector, the KESSP incorporated these objectives and formulated strategies and
IPs to achieve them. The choice to use a Sector-wide Approach (SWAp) to program
development was highly appropriate because the national development strategies placed the
need for a more highly skilled labor force at the center of economic development and
poverty reduction objectives, in addition to the achievement of UPE. FPE was also a
central component of a broader decentralization and social accountability agenda. It was
within this context that the IDA and FTI support was provided (paragraph 8 explains more
fully the rationale for IDA support).

                                             6
25.     Sector Wide Approach. The design of the IDA credit to support KESSP
implementation was appropriate. When the IDA credit was prepared in 2006/07, all
evidence pointed to considerable achievements in the sector-wide approach (with a pooled
fund) that the GoK and development partners had already been implementing. There was a
clear consensus among Government and development partners that having a sector-wide
approach in the education sector was appropriate to promote greater aid alignment,
harmonization and coordination, and to reduce the fragmentation of external support. There
was also consensus that a sector-wide approach was feasible in view of: (a) the progress
that had already been made in these areas since KESSP was launched in 2005, and (b)
demonstrated strong GoK leadership in the sector.

26.    KESSP had many characteristics of good practice in sector wide approaches in its
preparation and design including the following:

       GoK had consistently shown a high level of leadership and ownership of the
        KESSP, and it backed-up its commitment to KESSP with public resources.

       Consultations on the design were broad-based and drew from a range of instruments
        to engage stakeholders, including (i) more formal meeting/workshop events which
        opened up opportunities for engagement with Non-Government Organizations
        (NGOs), and (ii) client satisfaction and expenditure tracking surveys (for FPE)
        which provided feedback from stakeholders that were not well represented in
        formal partnership bodies. The KESSP Governance Action Plan planned to further
        strengthen these and other client feedback mechanisms.

       There was strong donor coordination and alignment. The KESSP had a formalized
        Government-led process for donor coordination and reporting that functioned
        reasonably well from the perspective of MoE and development partners.5 There
        was also a donor working group (with a rotating lead coordinator), which served as
        a forum to exchange information, discuss sector issues and coordinate support.
        There was broad consensus between Government and development partners on
        most key policy and management issues in the sector. Development partners had
        collectively appraised KESSP in 2005 and had aligned their financing to it.

       Since 2005, development partners had been supporting the use of country systems
        for implementation, financial management, monitoring and evaluation. They drew
        on common analyses and worked with the MoE to strengthening these systems. A
        pooled fund was also operational. This aimed to lower transaction costs and
        facilitate the use of country systems for budgeting, financial management and
        procurement, and the capture of external financing in the public budgeting process.



5
  Two annual reviews contributed to “joint? monitoring of implementation, problem identification and
solving, and prioritization of resource allocations for the following year. Conclusions and next steps were
summarized in a “joint? aide-memoire issued by the MoE.

                                                    7
27.     Technical and financial. KESSP was based on substantial sector work conducted
by the GoK and others. As far as primary education is concerned (which comprised the
majority of KESSP costs initially), available studies provided a credible basis for policy
and program development. 6 The MoE was also building on its FPE track record and
lessons learned were incorporated. Where studies provided an insufficient basis for policy
development, they were planned to fill the gaps. Potential efficiency gains were analyzed
with respect to teacher deployment, and strategies were developed to support financial
sustainability. KESSP strategies were also informed by the results of controlled
experiments to assess the impact of deworming, school uniforms and school meals on
school attendance and learning outcomes in Kenya.7

28.     High priority issues such as regional disparities, gender disparities, poverty
disparities, HIV/AIDs, orphans and vulnerable children and children with special needs
were assessed. Targeting strategies incorporated by investment programs included a
geographical focus (ASAL areas and urban settlements), institutions known to serve poor
populations (NFE schools), populations vulnerable to food insecurity (school feeding
program), and the most disadvantaged communities (within broader investment programs
such as school infrastructure).

29.    KESSP was developed within, and was accompanied by a comprehensive medium-
term resource and expenditure framework for the sector to facilitate coherence between
policy objectives, resources, results and sustainability. Within the framework, expenditure
was prioritized in terms of budget shares to protect the highest priority expenditure (i.e.,
FPE). KESSP planning and budgeting cycles were aligned with national cycles and the
projected resource and expenditure framework was to be updated annually as part of GoK-
wide Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and Public Expenditure Review
(PER) processes.

30.     Despite the strength of the program’s design, two aspects of the design proved to
make the monitoring of achievement towards certain KESSP targets difficult: (a) lack of
clarity in the definition and measurement of some progress indicators (such as provincial
disparities and equity in teacher distribution), and (b) a KESSP budget structure that did not
easily correspond to that of the MoE, rendering it very difficult to have clear visibility on
total expenditure by program - MoE and development partners combined.



6 These included poverty assessments, studies of orphans and vulnerable children, FPE expenditure tracking
and Non-Government Organizations studies on vulnerable populations
7
  Distribution of school uniforms has been shown to reduce dropout rates (Evans, Kremer, and Ngatia, 2008,
and Duflo, Dupas, Kremer and Sinei, 2006). Deworming has been shown to be a highly cost-effective
strategy to increase school attendance (Miguel and Kremer, 2004). This reduced absenteeism by 25%. On the
basis of the evaluation, the KESSP helped to scale up deworming to a country policy level. School meal
programs have been shown to increase attendance at pre-schools, especially among the poorest children
(Kremer and Vermeersch, 2004).

31.     Governance and fiduciary matters. The Bank team exercised a high level of
fiduciary due diligence at the project entry stage, and risk mitigation measures included in
the project were comprehensive. The project’s risk assessments drew on relevant aspects of
country and sector public financial management assessments, including: (i) a 2006 Country
Portfolio Performance Review, (ii) a 2006 detailed risk assessment carried out by DFID on
behalf of development partners covering financial management, procurement, governance
and the FPE instructional materials grant program, (iii) a 2006 World Bank detailed
implementation review of the education sector, and (iv) KESSP financial audit reports on
the KESSP pooled fund from 2005 and 2006. The various reports concluded that despite
progress in the implementation of FPE, the risk of corruption remained high. The DFID
assessment concluded that there was a general positive trajectory of change in the
education sector, which the education sector had an excellent project track record, and there
was a credible program of public financial management reform in place at the national and
sectoral levels. The assessment also identified major risks in the areas of procurement,
internal controls, ineffective oversight and lack of capacity. The detailed implementation
review (2006) cited the need for additional safeguards in public disclosure of information,
independent performance monitoring and annual independent procurement audits.
Financial audits highlighted issues of un-surrendered imprests, irregular payments to
officers and contractors, eroding compliance with FPE processes, and weakness in
monitoring expenditure at the school level.8

32.     The issues highlighted in these reports were clearly summarized in the KESSP
     9
PAD and the studies’ recommendations were incorporated, along with other measures, in:
(i) a Governance and Accountability Action Plan (GAAP) which focused on improving
consultations, social accountability, procurement, financial management and public
expenditure management; and (ii) a Governance Strengthening Plan (GSP) which included
specific actions to strengthen monitoring and evaluation, communication, public disclosure
and KESSP management structures (PAD Annex 2). The overall risk of the IDA credit at
entry was assessed as substantial in the first year of the project and modest thereafter,
assuming that the risk mitigation measures were implemented well. Efforts were
undertaken to strengthen fiduciary capacity prior to Credit effectiveness while effectiveness
conditions related exclusively to financial management and procurement measures.10

33.    KESSP performance monitoring instruments were comprehensive, and designed to
provide an adequate level of checks and balances. Monitoring progress towards the
achievement of the KESSP outcomes was to be done by MoE systems, namely the
education management information system (EMIS) and the National Assessment of

  A 2006 year-end audit report by Ernst and Young found that as a share of sampled primary schools: (a) 54
percent had complied with procedures for the establishment and maintenance of School Management
Committees, down from 90 percent in 2005; 20 percent complied with procurement procedures; and 69
percent received funds in line with enrolment compared with over 90 percent in 2005.

   Effectiveness conditions were conversion to the general ledger module of the Ministry of Finance
Integrated Financial Management Information System, recruitment of an independent Procurement
Monitoring Agent, procurement staffing, and adoption of procurement manuals.

                                                    9
Student Learning Achievements (NASLA). The main accountability interventions
included: (i) technical audits of processes (expenditure tracking surveys and school audits),
(ii) financial audits, (iii) social accountability instruments (Client Satisfaction Surveys and
School Score Cards), and (iv) an inclusive management framework that brings together
Government, development partners, private sector and civil society as shown in Annex 11.
A high quality Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) and baseline NASLA had been
conducted, and joint review meetings had been taking place regularly.

34.     With the benefit of hindsight, given that PETS and social accountability instruments
were either partially implemented or not implemented at all before credit closing (see
section 2.2), greater clarity in the attribution of responsibilities for the implementation of
all elements of the governance plans at the design stage may have helped to enable their
implementation earlier.

2.2 Implementation

35.     Country environment. The positive economic trends and relatively stable political
environment during the period following the 2003 elections had begun to erode. In early
2008, post-election violence rocked Kenya, resulting in the deaths of over 1,100 people, the
displacement of over 300,000 people, and vast property damage. Many schools in the most
affected parts of the country became overcrowded, having to accommodate additional
children of internally displaced families; others were burned down, looted or vandalized.
The post-election violence significantly disrupted normal operations of the school system
and administration in the affected parts of the country, and necessitated a focus on
emergency measures to rebuild and rehabilitate schools in the affected areas for at least six
months.11 Further, political developments in 2008-2009 (e.g. the formation of the coalition
government and the adoption of a new Constitution in 2010) gave rise to challenges
associated with staff changes and with re-districting. From a governance perspective, the
Government’s auditing capacity gradually improved in 2009-2010 which enabled the
uncovering of fraud and corruption through GoK processes.

36.     Project at risk status. During the first year of the IDA Credit, progress attained on
development outcomes and implementation progress was rated Moderately Satisfactory as
systems were being established. By December 2008, both ratings improved due to the
progress recorded toward the PDO targets and on the fiduciary front, respectively. Project
monitoring during the year, however, was affected by factors including the post-election
crisis. By May 2009, implementation progress ratings declined steadily due to the lagged
effects of the post-election emergency, and as audits were conducted and evidence of fraud
and corruption emerged. Subsequently, the IDA credit fell into problem status (section 2.4
outlines the actions taken by the World Bank in response to the audit findings.) The
Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) recorded this trend for implementation.



11
    Informal settlements in Nairobi, and the towns of Eldoret, Nakuru and Naivasha in the Rift Valley
Province, Kisumu in the Nyanza Province, and Mount Elgon in the Western Province were the most affected
areas. Many schools became temporary camps for internally displaced persons; others were burned down,
looted, and vandalized.

                                                  10
However, with the information at hand, the progress rating towards the project
development objective should have also been downgraded at this time. It subsequently was
downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory, but regrettably, this final ISR was archived
shortly after the formal project closure, and therefore not recognized as one of the final
ratings by project closure. Further data became available on the project progress after
project closure, which after careful analysis, has led the ICR team to conclude an
Unsatisfactory rating overall for the project.

Achievements

37.     Annex 2, Table 2(b) outlines the achievements based on available data. Below are
some specifics for KESSP investment programs which received consistent and relatively
significant support over the five-year period (2005-2010).

38.    KESSP leadership and participation. MoE technical leadership was maintained
throughout KESSP implementation (at least until April 2010) in the areas of sector strategy
development, planning and managing two KESSP reviews annually, and developing
investment program work plans and budgets. Further, over time, participation in KESSP
reviews was also broadened to include representatives of non-government organizations.

39.     Planning and policy development. KESSP helped to build a planning culture in
the MoE, and all partners expect to continue to combine their efforts to support an overall
sector strategy. The KESSP also put the issues of raising quality and using learning
learning assessments more firmly on the policy agenda. Further the range of policy and
strategy development supported under KESSP was extensive, including strategies for early
childhood education, school health, gender, non-formal schools, secondary education,
university education and TIVET.

40.     Schools. Despite the findings of fraud and corruption in the primary and secondary
school grant programs, the physical environment in many schools and the strategy of
providing resources to primary schools with community participation and monitoring was
effective during the early years. To a certain extent, the FPE strategy was a victim of its
own initial success, in that school grants became the dominant mechanism to achieve
objectives across the sector - for early childhood development centers, non-formal schools,
adult education centers and then, particularly, secondary schools. But, systems did not keep
pace as financial transactions multiplied.12 Further, the institutional capacity of the KESSP
Secretariat was heavily stretched as the KESSP grew larger. Despite this challenge, the
team worked to stay on course. IDA as the Joint Financing Agreement partner contact and
the supervising entity for the FTI had provided technical assistance to the MoE for the
development of financial management and procurement manuals. Related and continual
training had also been provided to appropriate entities at national and sub-national levels.




12
   Disbursements were made from the MoE through commercial banks to school accounts (two school
accounts in the case of FPE) two or three times a year to more than 22,000 institutions.

                                              11
41.     Development partner coordination. The findings of an FTI 2009 external
evaluation were that Kenya stood out among the nine reviewed countries (Cambodia,
Kenya, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan and Yemen) in
the areas of sectoral coordination, alignment, donor harmonization, and using a sector wide
approach which provided a basis for dialogue.

42.     Parent’s perceptions. A beneficiary assessment (Annex 6) undertaken by an
independent firm to inform the KESSP ICR shows that parents confirmed the perception
that access to schooling has increased, and that children are attending school more
regularly and performing better.

43.     School health. In 2009, 3.6 million school age children were dewormed
representing 80 percent of those at risk. Appropriate information on health issues have been
shown to be effective at reducing risky behavior. By improving the provision of
information and lifeskills education, the KESSP helped to address HIV/AIDS risks.
Lifeskills education was a high priority school health initiative in Kenya, and 22,000
primary schools received grants for training The Ministries of Education and Health co-
developed the first School Health Policy and Strategy for the country, and officially
launched the policy and strategy in 2009. The policy is currently under implementation,
and is focusing on developing an “essential? package of school health interventions in
Kenya, tailored to the sub-national needs.

44.     Most vulnerable children (MVC)13. The objective of the MVC support program
is to assist the children to access quality primary education in schools across Kenya.
Basically the program is intended to ensure that the MVCs currently enrolled in school stay
in school, those who have dropped out return to school, and those who have never been to
school are enrolled. The 2010-2011 Ed-PETS survey collected information on the impact
of the program. According to 94 percent of the head teachers, the MVC program has been
successful in realising its objectives. Nonetheless, 6 percent of schools are of the opinion
that the program has not full realised its objectives. In terms of the program impact on the
MVC population and the overall pupil population, 53 percent and 59.7 percent of
headteachers revealed that the grant has had a large positive impact with 45.3 percent and
39.5 percent revealing that the program has had some positive impact on the overall pupil
population and MVC population, respectively.




13
   The MoE and development partners have been working to ensure that orphans and most vulnerable
children are retained, returned and enrolled in primary schools. The program, called the Most Vulnerable
Children (MVC) Program, is in response to the increasing number of orphans in and out of school as a result
of HIV/AIDS and other reasons. Orphans are defined as children who are below 18 years, and who have lost
one or both parents for whatever reasons. On the other hand, vulnerable children are those children who: (i)
live households with a chronically ill person, whether a parent or not; (ii) live outside the family, under the
care of others; (iii) have been abandoned, neglected or abused; (iv) come from households where parents are
too poor to provide the necessary care and support; or (v) have been identified as vulnerable by the MVC
Sub-Committee based on local knowledge and experience. A total of 3,251 schools have received MVC
grants since the introduction of the program in 2007.

                                                     12
45.     Secondary education-Secondary Math and Science Teacher Training Program
(CEMASTEA). Primary and secondary inservice teacher training received attention under
the KESSP. Specific support on secondary science and mathematics training was provided
by the Japanese Technical Cooperation. From 2004-08 secondary school teachers were
provided training in mathematics and science. The objective was to upgrade the capability
of young Kenyans in mathematics and science. An evaluation undertaken by the Japanese
Technical Cooperation (JICA) in September 2007 showed that technical transfer was
effectively and efficiently conducted in both academic and management areas (SMASSE3,
2007). However, specific impact assessment of the training is yet to be undertaken14. The
SMASSE is a well-known program in the East African Community. Student performance
in science at primary school level shows an increase as measured by the KCPE (see
paragraph 73).

46.     Spatial mapping of schools. The KESSP provided the basis for significant work in
the area of spatial mapping of schools. Over a three-year period from 2008-2010 the MoE’s
Planning Unit focused on identifying all public and private primary and secondary schools
in the country using Geographic Information Systems technology. The School Mapping
information was officially launched during the 2011 Joint Review of the Education Sector
and Annual Budget Review Workshop.

Challenges/shortcomings

47.     Findings of fraud and corruption.  The findings of fraud and corruption had a
substantial negative impact on KESSP implementation. In addition to the loss of donor
financing15, there was more impact due to the time and effort required to deal with the
issues, the impact on staff morale, and subsequent turnover of staff, etc.

48.      Institutional development. The MoE and Ministry of Higher Education, Science
and Technology (MoHEST) are massive ministries to manage. However, the KESSP was
largely implemented by a small number of heavily worked and committed staff. As a
result, the performance of the sector was significantly affected by changes in key staff
positions, especially as the KESSP management systems were insufficiently
institutionalized in the MoE and efforts to strengthen institutional capacities were rather
fragmented and inadequate. Primary challenges during implementation set in during the
post-election emergency period and after, with the introduction of new policies and
strategies. The demands on institutional capacities of the two ministries of education
increased exponentially. This most likely contributed to the deterioration over time, in the
implementation progress of the KESSP. A compounding factor was the governance issues


14
   The monitoring and evaluation unit at CEMASTEA is tracking the in-service training activities
implementation including the application of ‘Activity Student Experiment and Improvisation’ (ASEI) and
‘Plan, Do, See Improve’ (PDSI) in the classroom. ASEI/PDSI is the SMASSE principle/philosophy for
student-centred teaching and learning.
15
   The suspension of donor financing may have contributed to communities not receiving second and third
tranche infrastructure grant payments, which is very regrettable. However, when JFA disbursements were
suspended in 2009, the GoK allocations were more than sufficient to cover the gap left by development
partners.

                                                  13
which imposed significant constraints, leading to demoralization over time of a relatively
highly motivated staff. Until June 2010 technical dialogue with the ministries was ongoing,
and program implementation for several activities proceeded with financing from
government. The IDA team and JFA partners also provided significant technical assistance
and capacity building support to help address the growing institutional demands as the
KESSP implementation responsibilities increased over time.

49.    Rapid increase in GoK financing and scale up of KESSP relative to capacity.
GoK resources allocated to education increased significantly over time, particularly in FY
2008/09 and 2009/10, due to FSE and higher allocations for tertiary education.16 Recurrent
non-salary expenditure on secondary education jumped from only KSh 1 billion in 2006/07
to 15 billion in 2009/10, (compared with KSh 6-7 billion per year for FPE grants). Unlike
primary education, where systems had been developed over years for infrastructure and
school grants, funds were disbursed for secondary school infrastructure and FSE grants in
the absence of clear policies, allocation criteria, guidelines, disbursement systems and
oversight, significantly elevating risks of fraud and corruption.17

50.     At the same time, the increased expenditure on secondary education stretched
human resource capacity in MoE and its antennae offices which had a negative impact on
the primary infrastructure program and the instructional materials grants. This happened at
a time when there was need for urgent attention to be given to the continued training of
School Management Committees (SMCs) and school heads due to rapid turnover, and
when school audit capacity fell well below what would be required to achieve the 5 percent
target anticipated (Abagi 2010). Financial management capacity also became increasingly
inadequate relative to the speed at which financial transactions multiplied.

51.     Governance. The governance and accountability action plan does not appear to
have benefited from the same level of leadership and ownership. Most components of the
governance and accountability action plan and governance strengthening plan relating to
oversight, social accountability and transparency were either only partially implemented or
not implemented at all which elevated governance risks associated with allowing the MoE
to plan, implement and monitor itself (Transparency International 2010). For example, of


16
   In 2008/09, MoE development allocations doubled (from less than KSh 4.5 billion to KSh 10.3 billion), and
doubled again in 2009/10 (to KSh 20 billion) most of which was allocated to secondary and tertiary education.
The additional increase in 2009/10 was mainly financed by the economic stimulus program. Of the stimulus
amount, 30 percent was allocated to primary school infrastructure and 60 percent to secondary schools in
each constituency (340 total) to upgrade into centers of excellence. Part of the MoE’s allocation was counted
as GoK financing of KESSP Investment Programs, part was managed outside that framework. During JFA
meetings, development partners expressed concern about the need for/to a financial sustainability analysis of
FSE, an “update? the secondary strategy accordingly and ensure the availability of manuals and training of
those involved. For these reasons, JFA partners decided against donor financing for FSE.
17
   An assessment of the FSE program in 2008 noted an urgent need to upgrade school financial management
capacities and introduce greater frequency and rigor in school account certifications and audits. It noted that
only one third of districts had received basic training; guidelines. Procurement and financial management
manuals were lacking. And only 200 provincial and district school auditors were responsible for the
certification and audit of at least 24,000 education institutions, which was grossly insufficient to meet the
accountability requirements of the Education Act (Read and Read 2008).

                                                     14
the advisory and management structures, which were intended to enhance participation,
accountability and transparency, only the Donor Coordinating Committee and the KESSP
Secretariat were established and functioning. The two main interventions to enhance social
accountability (community score cards and expenditure tracking surveys) were not fully
implemented. 18 In the absence of external information, monitoring and evaluation
depended heavily on what the MoE produced. Finally, public disclosure of information
(e.g. EMIS data, KESSP review reports, aggregate exam results, school grant amounts) on
the web was not achieved. The details are provided in Annex 13 which shows progress on
the KESSP governance strengthening plan.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

52.      The SWAp was designed to house the M&E activities within the KESSP
Secretariat. The design also required the use of country systems. It was agreed between
GoK and the development partners that the KESSP mid-term review would be undertaken
as a joint stakeholder exercise. It was also set to coincide with the annual Joint Review of
the Education Sector since the mid-term review exercise required harnessing the
institutional capacities of the MoE, the SAGAs, and the development partners actively
supporting the KESSP. The original date of the mid-term review per KESSP design was
October 2007. The date was however moved to October/November 2008. This was to
allow more time for implementation to get underway, and to have available data to enable
the assessment of progress. It was also agreed that in keeping with the use of country
systems, procurement for the mid-term review would be the responsibility of the MoE, with
technical support from JFA partners and technical specialists (consultants). Additional
external/third party evaluations, impact evaluations, and value-for-money audits were to be
undertaken over the KESSP implementation period as an integral part of the program
monitoring and evaluation.

53.      As the KESSP implementation unfolded, however, the demands on a small number
of monitoring and evaluation staff grew exponentially. This resulted in a slowing down of
progress on monitoring and evaluation. Insufficient progress on this also contributed
substantially to elevated risk and inadequate performance tracking. The monitoring and
reporting systems never developed sufficiently to provide reliable information on progress
achieved towards the development outcomes. Although some progress was made in
expanding the coverage of non-public schools, the EMIS data remained of questionable
reliability, despite the availability of capacity building support (including technical
assistance, hardware and software development, equipping and training district officers,
and school mapping). There were repeated expressions of concern by development partners
about the quality of the data, but all stakeholders used the data for monitoring purposes.

54.    MoE requested that an external firm undertake the evaluation on its behalf. The
mid-term review was significantly delayed due to procurement issues, with the final report


18
   Community score cards were not implemented due to opposition from Kenya National Union of Teachers
(KNUT) to the solicitation of feedback from parents on the performance of teachers. Expenditure tracking
surveys were not undertaken because the cost was deemed too high.

                                                   15
being presented during October 2009. The report by the external firm was considered to be
of unsatisfactory quality by the development partners. The JFA partners were closely
engaged throughout the mid-term review process, from the development of the terms of
reference, through to the conclusion of the process. Significant technical assistance by sub-
sector was brought to inform the mid-term evaluation. The activities included carrying out
interim supervision missions due to the size of the program, advising the external firm
about the issues, and in reviewing the draft versions of the mid-term review report.
Throughout the period KESSP implementation progress was satisfactory, with systems
which were initiated in the previous periods unfolding positively from a technical
perspective. Concurrently, however, the growing fraud and corruption aspects which
emerged in 2009 placed additional supervision demands. The KESSP Secretariat, the JFA
partners, and the MoE’s mid-term review team were unable to keep pace with the emerging
issues.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

55.    The pooled fund account was to be monitored through: (i) quarterly Integrated
Financial Reports (IFRs)/Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) prepared by MoE and
reviewed by IDA; and (ii) audits of the financial statements prepared by the Kenya
National Audit Office (KENAO).

56.     As part of its strategy to support the strengthening of country systems, IDA and
other development partners provided support to strengthen GoK audit capacities, among
other key initiatives to strengthen Public Financial Management (PFM) systems19. As a
result of the policy dialogue, in 2008 MoF expanded the remit of the Internal Audit
Department (IAD) to include donor funded projects as well as value for money audits, and
provided a framework for conducting risk assessments. The auditing capacity of KENAO
also improved. 20 Thereafter, in consultation with IDA, Treasury directed the IAD to
conduct a Risk-Based Fiduciary Review and Funds Flow Analysis of all (25) World Bank
funded projects and Trust Funds (January – March 2009). The risk profiling assessment
identified 5 active projects with potentially serious integrity issues, one of which was
KESSP. 21 Subsequently, treasury directed IAD to conduct in-depth reviews of these
projects, with IDA providing technical, financial and supervisory assistance to the IAD.

57.    The in-depth audit was conducted over three months (July-September 2009) and
was limited to only 30 percent of MoE headquarter payment vouchers and 48 imprest


19
   An indepth discussion of the chronological governance and risk management aspects of the KESSP is
available in the project files (see Mills and Sosale, March 2011). Also refer to Annex 13.
20
   During the first two years of the IDA Credit/JFA, KENAO did not follow international auditing standards
and conducted only a desk review of the financial statements provided by the MoE (with no sample
verification of documentation, assessment of internal controls, etc.). Further, the audits focused were mainly
on KESSP Secretariat and did not extend to the investment programs and school-level spending.
21
   The review of KESSP flagged weaknesses in school financial management, in compliance with budget,
accounting, and procurement laws and regulations, in transparency, accountability, governance and internal
control systems. Further, financial audits for the previous three years had all been qualified. MoE rejected
the report (due to the small sample) and failed to implement any of its recommendations.

                                                     16
vouchers for the month of June 2009, and to 96 primary schools and 68 secondary schools,
among other tests. Based on a draft report, in September 2009, the Minister of Finance
issued a press statement that IAD had found evidence of fraudulent and corrupt activities in
KESSP and that the Government had initiated a series of actions.22 Key findings of the in-
depth audit (October 2009) included losses of KSh 234 million (US$ 3 million) from the
small sample of expenditures for a single month, and coordination structures that were
either not functioning as envisaged or were sidelined in certain decision-making processes.
The draft audit report had not yet been completed or validated by the audited entity (i.e.
MoE) at that time.

58.     Following the announcement and discussion with GoK officials, IDA decided
informally to suspend disbursements pending completion and validation of the audit reports
which were completed in April 2010. The JFA partners also suspended disbursements to
the pooled fund pending: (a) completion of the audit with validation of the report by IAD
and MoE, (b) separation from the project of staff alleged to have been involved in fraud or
corruption, (c) clear identification of misappropriated funds and reimbursement by GoK,
and (d) an action plan that fully addresses systemic failures in project implementation
identified by the audit, acceptable to the JFA Partners. The World Bank’s Integrity
Department (INT) also advised that a comprehensive forensic audit be undertaken to assess
whether further investigative work would be required.

59.     The MoE took four months to validate the staffing portion of the audit report23 and
another three months to validate school-level issues and prepare an action plan. Yet still,
outstanding information required from the MoE precluded finalization of the in-depth
audit. After consultations with development partners, World Bank officially suspended
disbursements to KESSP on May 1, 2010, pending: (a) validation of the remaining sections
of the IAD report, (b) reimbursing ineligible expenditures in the agreed proportions with
KESSP pooling partners, and (c) providing evidence of improvements in the MoE’s
financial management systems in accordance with the agreed action plan.

60.    In July 2010, the forensic audit was launched by IAD with support from the IDA
financial management team and the Department of Institutional Integrity (INT).24 The audit
covered FY2007/08 and FY2008/09, a larger number of investment programs and a
representative sample of primary and secondary schools. In September 2010, a draft report
was available with provisional findings of KSh 8.4 billion (US$105 million) in ineligible
expenditure. However, still much documentation was missing from the MoE and numerous


22
     The actions included initiating the suspension of staff implicated, instructing the Attorney General to
freeze the project accounts, and referring the IAD report to the Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission (KACC)
for further investigation.
23
   Staff members alleged to have been involved were suspended and their cases turned over to the KACC.
24
   The forensic audit outputs were: (i) an Internal Controls Environment Report for MoE and MoHEST; (ii) a
Quantification Report on ineligible expenditures; (iii) a Forensic Report of suspected fraud (to be referred to
the KACC), and a (iv) School Level Report.




                                                     17
issues were identified, including lack of effective oversight; non-cooperation with the audit,
numerous examples of internal financial controls not working, disbursement schedules
open to manipulation and human error, persistent entry of incorrect information, routine
flouting of financial management procedures, tampering with approved disbursement
schedules, and extremely deficient record keeping others. Problems were also found in the
MoE’s procurement systems.

61.     The forensic audit concluded in May 2011 and showed unaccounted expenditure of
Kshs.4.8 billion (US$60.2 million) for fiscal years 2007/08 and 2008/09. The financial
audit for FY 2009/10 identified additional ineligible expenditure in the TIVET program.

62.     Other Safeguards. Due to the school building component, the Project triggered the
Environment Assessment and Involuntary Resettlement Operational Policies (OP 4.01 and
4.12) with a Category B rating. In line with World Bank policy, prior to appraisal, an
acceptable Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and implementation manual had been
prepared by the Borrower, and these provided guidelines and processes for the screening of
school infrastructure projects to be funded by KESSP and relating to land acquisition,
involuntary resettlement and impact on livelihoods. The MoE conducted widespread
training in the application of these procedures, under the leadership of the Ministry of
Environment and with technical assistance provided by KESSP partners. The application
of the EMP was moderately satisfactory during project implementation. The majority (95
percent) of school infrastructure sub-projects financed by the KESSP concerned the
rehabilitation of existing structures, and many of the new projects were too small to
necessitate a full Environmental Assessment. The National Environmental Management
Authority (NEMA) granted licenses before construction on new schools began, and all
local and national environmental regulations were followed in the screening and
construction at the project sites.

63.     While the Project improved the health environment of the schools that received
funding (due to cemented floors and improved availability of water and latrines), the gap in
basic infrastructure remains large. In 2010, about 80 percent of a sample of schools were
found to have incomplete priority infrastructure in place. Further improvement is also
needed in enforcing procurement regulations and providing quality control as numerous
examples of poor construction quality were also found (Abagi 2010).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

64.     From the MoE’s perspective, the next phase of KESSP will be delayed for about
two years due to the time that it will take to: (i) resolve the fraud and corruption issues; (ii)
revise the next program based on lessons learned; (iii) re-align the education sector to the
new Constitution; and (iv) develop a new Sessional Paper and Education Act. With respect
to IDA, sector financing would depend upon actions taken by GoK to address the findings
of the IAD forensic audit.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

65.      KESSP was a central program of the GoK’s national development strategies (ERS
and Vision 2030) and of the World Bank’s 2004 Country Assistance Strategy. The KESSP
strategy and investment programs remain highly relevant to Kenya’s current development
priorities and to global education priorities, including the focus on the achievement of the
MDGs for education, and the strategies developed for TIVET and university education.
Using a SWAp and a pooled fund was consistent with global good practice
recommendations to enhance aid-effectiveness. However, this harmonized approach makes
it difficult to attribute specific outcomes to IDA financing alone, especially when that
support was such a small proportion of total program resources available.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

66.     There were ten project development objective indicators associated with the four
“project components?. Six related to primary school access and completion, one to
secondary school access, one to primary student achievement, and the other two to GoK
expenditure effort on primary education. The indicators were to be monitored by the
monitoring and evalaution components of the KESSP-- namely EMIS, NASLA and annual
sector expenditure reviews. The analysis below is based on triangulating data from
available sources in order to establish a degree of objectivity to the review (refer Annex 3
for the analysis and rating method adopted).

PDO Objective 1: Equity in Access to Basic Education

67.    Indicator 1: Primary Net Enrolment Ratio (NER). The KESSP targeted the
achievement of a primary Net Enrolment Ratio (NER) of 96 percent in 2010 over the 2005
EMIS baseline of 83 percent, for a 13 percentage points increase over the five-year KESSP
period 2005-2010.
                                                       Chart 2. Primary Net Enrolment Ratio (NER): MoE and
68.     Chart 2 shows a comparison of the MoE          Survey/Census Results, 2005-2009
NER and those published by household surveys                     Percent
                                                             100
and the population census over the same period
with a linear trend line derived from the data                90
points.    The growing difference over time
between the two data sets is striking. According              80

to MoE data, significant progress was achieved.
                                                              70
Between 2005 and 2009, the NER rose by 10
percentage points. Projecting the trend to 2010,              60
the NER would reach the KESSP target which
                                                              50
would be a highly satisfactory outcome,                                    2005          2008             2009
particularly in light of any mitigating effects that       Surveys         79.0           78.8            77.2
the period of post-election violence in 2008 might         MoE             83.2           92.5            92.9
have had.                                                                  Surveys               MoE
                                                       Sources: 2005 KIHBS, 2008 DHS, 2009 Population Census, 2010
                                                       MoE Statistical Report
                                              19
69.     In contrast, however, household surveys and the population census show a
stagnating NER at around 79 percent, with a possible deterioration over time. Given that
greater credibility is placed in the survey data which show no increase in the NER over the
entire period, progress achieved would be rated Unsatisfactory.               However, the
stagnation/decline of the NER over time may have been partly influenced by the period of
post-election violence whose impact cannot be measured with the available data. A
Moderately Unsatisfactory rating would imply an adjustment of four to six percentage
points, or between one-third and one-half of the increase targeted over the KESSP period.

70.     Indicator 2: Provincial Equity. Progress toward improvements in equity across
Provinces was to be measured by the difference between the average NER for each
Province and the national average NER. “Lagging? Provinces were defined as those that
fell below the national average NER.

71.    Charts 3 and 4 show a comparison of the difference between the national average
NER and provincial averages based as reported by the MoE for 2005 and 2008 (the latest
year for which data were available), and by the 2005 Kenya Integrated Household Budget
Survey (KIHBS) and the 2008 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Compared with
the household survey results, the EMIS: (a) significantly overestimates the relative
disadvantage of Nairobi and central provinces which have historically reported NERs
above the national average, and (b) underestimates the relative disadvantage of the Rift
Valley Province which is the most populous province (27 percent of the population), was
the province most affected by post election violence, and which fell further behind.

72.    To assess progress towards the objective of raising lagging provinces closer to the
national average, in practice, MoE and development partners focused on northeastern
province where the gap was widest. However, MoE data show no progress in closing the
gap between the average NER for northeastern province relative to the national average,
and perhaps a slight regression. Household surveys show a modest reduction in the gap of 5
percentage points (from 30 to 25). Assuming the same trend forward, in 2010 the gap

                                                                       20
between northeastern and the national average would be projected to have closed by about
8 percentage points over the KESSP period. Giving greater credibility to the survey data
and considering that no specific target had been set, and that northeastern province should
be used to assess progress on this indicator because that is effectively what was used by
MoE and development partners, progress achieved toward this objective is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.

73.     Indicator 3: Gender Equity. The objective of KESSP was to reduce the disparity
in the NER of girls relative to boys where the 2005 baseline values were 83 percent for
girls and 84 percent for boys. No specific target was set. To facilitate a comparison of the
gender-specific ratios over time, they are simply converted to the widely used Gender
Parity Index (GPI)25. Table 1 shows the gender-specific NERs reported by the MoE and
household surveys, and the resulting               Table 1. Gender Parity Index (GPI) 2005-09: MoE and

Satisfactory.

74.     Indicator 4: Primary Completion Rate (PCR). Progress achieved toward the
attainment of the PCR target is rated Unsatisfactory. The EMIS is the only source of data
for the Primary Completion Rate indicator.26 The KESSP set a target to reach a national
average PCR of at least 92 percent in 2010, relative to the 2005 baseline of 80, or a 12
percentage point increase over 2005-2010. According to the MoE, by 2009 the primary
completion rate had increased by 3 percentage points over the baseline, or about one-third
the increase targeted over that period.

PDO Objective 2: Enhance Quality and Learning Achievement

75.     Progress achieved toward attainment of enhanced learning achievement is Not
Rated due to lack of data. Progress towards this objective was to be measured by a
criterion-referenced sample-based National Assessment of Learning Achievement


25
   The GPI is computed by dividing the average NER for girls by the average NER for boys. A value of one
equals parity; less than one indicates a female disadvantage; and more than one indicates a male
disadvantage.
26
   The EMIS defines the primary completion rate as “the ratio of the total number of students successfully
completing or graduating from Standard 8 in a given year to the total number of children of official
graduation age in the population.?

                                                     21
(NASLA) comparable to the national assessment conducted in 2005 that formed the
baseline. Although a follow-on NASLA was fielded in 2009 following four years of design
work (results were published in 2011), the results cannot be used to assess progress in
learning achievement against the baseline because the NASLA tested Class 3 students
against the learning objectives for that grade, whereas the baseline tested Class 4 students.

76.     In the absence of comparable achievement assessments, the Implemention Status
and Results Reports (ISRs) reported a measure of the national average Kenya Certificate of
Primary Education (KCPE) exam score as an alternative. The KCPE exam constitutes the
sole, nationwide, standardized test for primary students in Kenya. It is administered at the
completion of eight years of education. Taking the KCPE is a necessary requirement for
completion of primary school, but is not necessarily taken by all pupils enrolled in grade
eight. There is self-selection of exam takers due to varying reasons (Bold, Kimenyi,
Mwabi and Sandefur, 2010). According to the Kenya National Examinations Council
(KNEC), the KCPE exam mean percentage score is calculated as the sum of the scores of
all students who took the exam divided by this number of students. The numerator is a
standardized score. Although generally there has been a rise in the national mean
percentage score since 2008 compared with other years, it is unclear if this is statistically
significant since the standard deviation is not known. Over the KESSP period, KCPE
results show a mixed picture of decline in English, flat in Math and improvement in
Science relative to the baseline.

77.    For the purposes of the ICR, the mean KCPE score trend, therefore, cannot be
meaningfully interpreted primarily, but not exclusively, because further analysis of the
underlying data would be required to assess whether changes in the overall test taking
population occurred in order to control for sampling biases. This is especially important in
Kenya where analyses of changes in learning achievement using the KCPE exam scores
during the early years of FPE showed a substantial change in public and private enrolment
and the socio-economic composition of children in the two sectors (Bold et al 2010, Mbiti
2009). An extension of the Bold and Mbiti analyses to more recent years would help
provide an interpretation of more recent trends in KCPE results, but that is beyond the
scope of the ICR.

PDO Objective 3: Provide Opportunities for Further Education and Training

78.     Progress towards this objective was to be measured by the Secondary School
Transition Rate. This is defined as the percentage of youth who passed the KCPE
examination who enrolled in secondary school the following year. The target was an
increase in the transition rate from 54 percent in 2005 to 70 percent by 2010. The EMIS,
which shows the target having been achieved in 2009, is the only source of data for this
indicator. Therefore progress is rated Satisfactory.

79.    It was estimated that assuming a modest average annual growth rate in public
revenue, and based on the KESSP targets and projection forward of unit costs at each level
of education at the same relative ratio,

expenditure.

80.    Progress in maintaining the targeted levels of expenditure is rated Unsatisfactory
not only because the shares declined,27 but more importantly because by 2009, total non-
salary expenditure per primary student had fallen well below the requisite FPE grant.
Further, within primary education, non-salary expenditure dropped to 11 percent of
recurrent expenditure.    On average, during 2008/09-2009/10 primary non-salary
expenditure was KSh 2 billion less than the amount required. In contrast, non-salary
expenditure on secondary education had increased by KSh 12 billion, and per student
expenditure quadrupled (Table 2).

Intermediate/Output Indicators

81.     Intermediate/Output Indicator 1. Pupil: Teacher Ratio rises along with a
decline in district disparity. The pupil:teacher ratio was intended to monitor progress
towards a more efficient, equitable and effective deployment of primary teachers -
efficient to reduce the fiscal salary burden through a rise in the national average pupil:
teacher ratio from 43:1 to 45:1, and equitable because it would be achieved in part by
reducing the share of districts that fell furthest above and below a set norm.

82.     Progress is rated as Moderately Satisfactory. Although the national average target
was achieved, district disparities were not reported as part of KESSP monitoring. An
analysis of district disparities conducted 2010 concluded that the available data do not
clearly point to a reduction in district disparities (Brown 2010).

sole use of either and English or a mathematics book. These results combined with the
fundamental centrality of the FPE instructional materials grant to the achievement of all the
KESSP objectives for primary education, progress achieved is rated Unsatisfactory.

84.     Intermediate/Output Indicator 3. Strategies for Further Education and
Training. Achievement is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Significant policy development
was undertaken. In 2007, the MoE prepared a secondary education strategy. Donor partners
appraised and endorsed it. This was followed by the preparation of strategies for TIVET
and university education. Although the TIVET and university strategies are still awaiting
cabinet or parliamentary approval, they are making their way through the “system? and
may be expected to support major reforms in the future. However, the relevance of the
strategy for secondary education was soon eclipsed by the introduction of FSE which like
FPE eliminated school fees and provided a Government subsidy per student to replace
them. FSE was not a not a part of the secondary education strategy that development
partners had endorsed. Development partners recommended that the strategy be revised and
that a sustainability analysis of the new policy be conducted before donors would
contribute to its financing. The revision and analysis have not yet been done.

3.3 Efficiency

85.     The absence of recent surveys on employment and household expenditure precludes
an analysis of the private and social returns to investments in education.28 Certainly, the
financial losses under KESSP both increased the cost of the progress that was achieved and
lowered the probability of achieving development outcomes. However, for a cost-
effectiveness analysis of the various investment programs, complications are introduced by
the difficulty of: (a) matching the KESSP investment program structure to the MoE budget,
and (b) deriving an estimate of the full extent of losses by investment program.


28
    In 2010, a DFID economic team extensively explored the feasibility of estimating rates of return and found
it to be not feasible.

                                                     24
86.     Nevertheless, to provide some perspective of the impact, as of June 2011, total
ineligible expenditures for the Fiscal Years 2007/08 and 2008/09 channeled through the
pooled fund mechanism stood at KSh 4.8 billion (US$60.2 million), which represents 12.8
percent of total expenditure by the fund over that time. In 2008, a value for money study
estimated that the instructional materials grants disbursed to primary schools over 2005-
2008, barring exceptional circumstances, should have been sufficient to reach the KESSP
target of a set of three textbooks for each primary student. In addition to losses to due fraud
and corruption documented in the financial audit reports, this study estimated additional
losses due to textbook theft at about 10 percent of the book stock in the primary schools.
Assuming the same loss rate in 2009, total losses in the primary instructional materials
grant program might be roughly estimated at a minimum of 22 percent of total expenditure
on that program over this time.

87.     From a policy perspective, whether the Free Secondary Education policy was the
most cost-effective option to improve equity in access to secondary education is a pertinent
question for two reasons. First, although a slightly larger proportion of low-income
students were able to attend secondary education, this result might have been achieved with
significantly lower expenditure through an expanded and better targeted bursary program.
Second, the FSE policy jeopardized the attainment of the objectives for primary education
to the extent that: (a) the policy placed fiscal pressure on non-salary expenditure, and (b)
expenditure on FPE fell below the entitlement amount.

88.      The value for money study on infrastructure which was an external review found
that overall, most respondents at national, district and school levels held the view that: (a)
the selection process for KESSP schools was very fair because it was informed by actual
visits to schools and determination of the nature and level of needs of individual schools in
a participatory process that involved school committees and district teams; (b) the selection
of program schools was also deemed equitable because the distribution of the funded
schools was concentrated in the low resourced communities in the districts.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

89.    The overall outcome rating is Unsatisfactory based on an all-round assessment of
relevance, achievement and efficiency. The table below provides the individual ratings.

needs, and some progress was made towards achieving targets for gender parity, reducing
net enrolment disparities in Northeastern province, and increasing the transition rate from

                                                               25
primary to lower secondary school. However, achievement of project development
objectives was largely not met for the following key areas: overall net enrolment rate,
primary completion rate, primary education share of the MoE recurrent budget, primary
non-salary expenditure, and textbook/pupil sharing. Another major area of the quality focus
was student learning achievement, but this objective could not be rated due to lack of
comparable data.

91.     Based on the earlier discussion, the efficiency with which resources were employed
is rated “Unsatisfactory? across the three areas that account for over 90 percent of audited
expenditure for fiscal years 2007/08 and 2008/09, namely: (i) primary instructional
materials grants (30 percent), (ii) primary school infrastructure (16 percent), and (iii)
secondary education (45 percent), due to significant efficiency losses resulting from fraud,
corruption and weak management oversight. Strengthening sector management is rated
“Moderately Unsatisfactory? based on the following considerations. The MoE exerted
considerable effort to manage the primary teacher salary budget (by allowing the
student:teacher ratio to rise) and to pursue solutions to resolve inequities in teacher
distribution (e.g. hiring contract teachers), measures which were strongly opposed by the
teacher’s union. However, efficiency within the capacity building program was
unsatisfactory due to considerable loss of funds and the continued need for a more
comprehensive capacity development program. Finally, from an equity perspective, the
allocative efficiency of resource distribution between primary and secondary education fell.

Rating: High

92.    At appraisal, Bank staff identified seven main risks to progress towards the
Development Objectives, two of which were assessed to have a high probability of
occurrence and pose significant risks - limited technical capacity for financial management
and procurement, and corruption and misuse of funds. Detailed analyses of the risks were
conducted, and a comprehensive package of risk mitigation measures was adopted.

93.    Two areas where the risks were difficult to foresee were those generated by: (a)
lack of implementation of social accountability and transparency measures which were

                                            26
intended to provide ongoing feedback on the effectiveness of FPE processes and impact
even if financial audit capacities were weak, and (b) a significant increase in GoK
financing and scaling-up of secondary and tertiary education expenditure which elevated
governance risks.

94.    An area where the risk was underestimated was that posed by insufficient impact of
capacity building on the quality of the data systems that were relied upon to monitor
progress towards development outcomes. Robust and timely data were particularly
important for the KESSP given that the annual allocations to the KESSP and across the
investment programs were based on outcome and implementation progress.

95.     Risk to Continuing Operation. KESSP was designed for a period of five years
which came to an end in 2010. Many of the key KESSP programs are likely to continue
over the medium term. Specifically, barring a financial crisis, the FPE and FSE school
grants programs are likely to continue because they have political support, are anchored in
GoK’s national development plans, and have consistently been backed up with public
resources. School feeding, early childhood development, and programs for vulnerable
children and in arid and semi-arid lands areas are continuing with support of World Food
Program (WFP), UNICEF and USAID. And there is little reason why, from the
perspectives of financial burden or human resource capacity, the NASLA and further data
analysis could not continue.

96.    However, based on the results to date, there are significant risks to: (a) the
achievement of the MDG of full enrolment and the completion of primary school by all
school-aged children, and (b) higher achievement due to lack of sole use of instructional
materials. The main problem is not resources, and evidence from earlier years suggests that
when well implemented the FPE strategy can produce value for money. The greatest risks
lie in continued corruption, inadequate oversight and accountability systems, and the
implementation of costly policies for short-term political gain.

97.    The continued operation of a SWAp is difficult to assess because it is influenced by
countervailing factors. On the country side, several factors facilitate the continuation of the
approach. First, experience has been built in the MoE and MoHEST for strategy
development and sector program management, and sound sector strategies exist in many
cases. Second, the benefits of donor coordination in terms of lower transaction costs are
widely acknowledged. Third, sustained use of MTEFs and expenditure reviews by GoK
will continue to provide a sector-wide financial framework as per the national budget. On
the development partner side, the Education Donor Coordination Group (EDCG) continues
to function, however, in the absence of strong leadership of the program by the
MoE/MoHEST and also unless there is strong attention given to fiduciary issues over an
extended period of time, the development partners may be reluctant to engage again in the
same manner, at least until the final results of the audits are available and certain conditions
are met. For example, DFID has recently decided to channel its aid to NGOs rather than
through the GoK.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

98.     The preparation of KESSP was led by Government and supported by all
development partners, with IDA playing a key supporting role in ensuring the quality of the
work through the provision of financing and technical support for studies, consultations and
policy dialogue, and extensive training of MoE staff. IDA brought in appropriate technical
expertise as needed across a variety of areas to assess the program (e.g. financial,
modeling, policy and strategy development). It would have been helpful to have looked
more closely at the realism of the set targets.

99.     IDA staff analyzed the risks and supported the Government to develop
comprehensive mitigation plans. In particular, the project design contained a detailed risk
assessment and a comprehensive governance action plan, based on background reviews and
studies. Around the launch of KESSP, various audits and analyses were conducted by
contributors to the pooled fund to assess the risks of the sector and the KESSP, and to
identify mitigation measures. There was a consensus then that considerable achievements
had already been made in strengthening accountability in the sector, especially in the
primary education sub-sector, but it was also recognized that the sector still faced serious
governance and corruption risks. Important documentation and training measures were
therefore taken to continue to build fiduciary capacity in 2006, prior to project
implementation. Governance concerns continued to be prominent as the IDA support to the
KESSP was put in place, with four effectiveness conditions all relating to fiduciary issues.
Notably, the declaration of project effectiveness was postponed, as the principle was rightly
maintained that project activities could not be allowed to commence until the fiduciary
strengthening conditions had been met.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

100. IDA supervision can be divided into three types: (a) technical/sectoral, (b)
coordination and (c) fiduciary. Technical supervision was carried out in two ways -
through day-to-day implementation support and through joint development partner-
Government activities, which were exercised through semi-annual joint reviews29. These


29
   On specific policy and operational matters, there were several areas where the Bank and other development
partners expressed repeated concerns that could pose a threat to development and intermediate outcomes.
These included: (a) the large number of out-of-school “missing children? not being reached by the program,
(b) the weaknesses of teacher management policies and practices to achieve greater equity across districts and
schools; (c) the need for a strategic and prioritized capacity building plan to support the implementation and
continued operation of the programs; (d) weak M&E and incomplete or unreliable data; and (e) the need for
greater communication and transparency, particularly through participation of a wider range of stakeholders,
as well as public disclosure of sector data and KESSP reports. The actions that development partners took to

                                                     28
included randomized school site visits. IDA contributed significantly to the technical policy
dialogue and provided quality technical assistance for the MoE in its development of sub-
sector strategies. An amendment of the targets during the project was needed, but was not
undertaken for reasons noted earlier.

101. The IDA team was regarded as a reliable partner in enhancing donor coordination
through active participation in Education Development Coordination Group (EDCG)
meetings, in engaging in a pooled funding arrangement and in being the lead agency for the
JFA partners. In particular, although consultation and lines of communication may not
always have been optimal, the JFA partnership worked with a high level of collegiality, and
the Bank generally made significant efforts to respect the terms of the JFA and consult
partners especially on fiduciary issues arising.

102. From the fiduciary perspective, IDA had supervision responsibilities for managing:
(a) the fiduciary aspects of the IDA Credit; (b) the FTI resources provided to the GoK, on
behalf of the contributing development partners; and (c) the resources put through the
pooled fund, as the lead agency for the JFA. The IDA team executed its coordinating
responsibilities, took actions to strengthen the GoK fiduciary processes and capacity, and
investigated suspicions and evidence of poor governance, fraud and corruption. In
particular, the strategy adopted by IDA to support the strengthening of GoK auditing
capacity was appropriate for the context. Regarding the corruption found: (a) the task team
did not release any funds at the start of FY10 even prior to the completion of the in-depth
review, due to concerns about governance; (b) the steps taken by IDA to undercover the
fraud were sustained, despite the difficulties and pressures encountered; (c) considerable
efforts were made to support those in Government who were responsible for the
investigatory work in order to strengthen country systems, to support the implementation of
the Government’s GAC plan, and to help build the capacity of Government systems.30
These extensive measures put substantial strain on IDA, as its financial management
capacity for such work in Kenya did not grow along with its country commitments, which
rose from US$500 million in 2007 to US$ 1.7 billion in 2009. Nevertheless, the required
auditing work was carried out with the support also of other development partners and the
leveraging of the Government’s own work.

103. Since pre-effectiveness of the IDA and the programmatic FTI support, the task team
was acutely aware of the potential for governance challenges in the Project. Hence the
team’s emphasis on the conditions for effectiveness which were: (a) conversion to an
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) of the operation of the
general ledger module within the MoE in a manner satisfactory to the Association; (b)
recruitment of an Independent Procurement Monitoring Agent (PMA) under terms of


address these weaknesses included supporting specific studies (e.g., non-formal schools, school mapping, and
textbook value for money audit), and technical assistance and training.




                                                    29
reference satisfactory to the Association; (c) recruitment, within the procurement unit of the
MoE, of two additional procurement staff under terms of reference satisfactory to the
Association; and (d) finalization and adoption of the Procurement Manuals in accordance
with the Public Procurement and Disposal Act of 2005, and its implementing regulations,
in a manner satisfactory to IDA, and subsequently their adoption. The IDA team also
emphasized and monitored the implementation conditions.

104. One major reporting issue relates to the inadequate EMIS, and particularly the
enrolment data. While the poor quality of the data was noted throughout the
implementation of the KESSP, and while several attempts were made to improve the
EMIS, the reality is that little progress was made. This may be partly attributable to several
factors: (a) the large number of investment programs and corresponding indicators to be
monitored; (b) insufficient time given to study the various EMIS-related reports during the
annual reviews; and (c) the nature of the JRES reporting process with a “joint aide-
memoire? issued by MoE and characterized by multiple lists of recommendations with
little prioritization. In addition to the EMIS data being produced two year late, there was a
lack of alternative sources of data on key outcome and intermediate indicators until 2009-
2010.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

105. The World Bank established and maintained good working relationships and open
dialogue with the MoE and with other development partners throughout KESSP
preparation and implementation. It brought in appropriate technical expertise as needed in
areas where it had a comparative advantage. IDA proactively identified fiduciary threats
and took appropriate steps to address them. However little progress was made in the
improvement of EMIS data.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

106. GoK displayed strong ownership of and commitment to the development objectives,
particularly UPE and later FSE, through its national development strategies, MTEF and
budgetary allocations31. The fraud and corruption found in KESSP emanated directly from
the strengthening of GoK’s own audit capacity, and the Kenyan authorities took
appropriate follow-up action, including for example, undertaking a forensic audit, referring
cases to KACC, and adopting new regulations for the management of imprests. Despite




31
   Here the “Government? is defined as primarily the Ministry of Finance and only relevant ministries
involved in the KESSP, excluding the MoE and the MoHEST (as they were the implementing agencies and
therefore rated separately).


                                                 30
this, Government’s performance with the overall fraud and corruption issues remained
problematic.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

107. The MoE displayed strong ownership and exercised leadership throughout the
KESSP preparation, and in preparing progress reports and managing the semi-annual joint
reviews. And as noted in section 2.3, KESSP and its processes registered some
achievements that are highly likely to continue. But the MoE’s performance was highly
unsatisfactory with respect to its fiduciary responsibilities and with its compliance in the
implementation of key components of the governance and accountability action plan that
were intended to provide a measure of checks and balance, including social accountability
and transparency measures and institutional structures to broaden stakeholder participation.
Negligence in these matters placed the entire KESSP program at risk of not achieving its
development objectives. The MoE was also slow to take any action to remedy the
weaknesses. It was largely uncooperative with auditors, and took far too long to validate
audit reports, thus delaying the start of further investigations for many months, and raising
the risk of evidence tampering.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Unsatisfactory

Government displayed strong ownership and commitment to the development objectives.
However, the MoE’s performance was highly unsatisfactory with respect to its fiduciary
responsibilities and compliance with the governance and accountability action plan.
Performance with the overall fraud and corruption issues remained problematic.

6. Lessons Learned

108. Developing systems requires taking informed risks. At the start, there did not appear
to be significant threats to the development outcomes, from the perspective of policy or
strategy. Indicators were moving in the right direction, as reported by the MoE, and the
main programs were therefore believed to be having the intended impacts. But the  KESSP
was an emerging program which would be scaled-up based on results and newly developed
strategies. It was also being implemented within an environment that evolved in
unexpected ways, due to economic and political circumstances, institutional weaknesses
and staff movements. In this, the education sector was not alone, as the World Bank 2010-
2013 Kenya Country Partnership Strategy notes that “experience shows that the economic,
social and political circumstances of Kenya may change unexpectedly.? Many lessons can
be drawn from the KESSP experience. Below, the focus is primarily on lessons relating to
the achievements and the most predominant weaknesses and challenges of the KESSP as a
SWAp attempting to use Government systems in a country environment where governance
risks are high. The lessons learned also align with the priority themes of the World Bank
Country Partnership Strategy.



                                             31
109. In order to ensure value for money and control corruption risks the focus needs to
be on strengthening Government systems, and particularly on risk based approaches in
financial management, procurement and auditing systems. In the case of the KESSP, the
strengthening of KENAO and IAD were key ingredients to uncovering the fraud and
corruption that occurred. In the absence of these improvements, it is unlikely that the fraud
and corruption would have been discovered at that time, given the lack of robust data on
implementation and outcomes, and the inadequate implementation of social accountability
and transparency measures. In particular, since school audits were deemed by the MoE to
be too costly to carry out everywhere, consideration should be given to adopting elements
of the risk-based approach introduced by IAD to determine if they might be useful for the
development of such an approach to school auditing. In addition, it is notable that the
KESSP was scaled up significantly (particularly with FDSE) without clear procedures and
adequate institutional capacity, and this contributed significantly to KESSP’s downfall.
Another lesson is that, when programs are about to be scaled-up, it may be useful to re-
evaluate institutional capacity quickly and immediately for fiduciary, collateral and
implementation risks.
 
110. SWAps must include a strong focus on governance and accountability. This can be
achieved by including measures relating to social accountability, transparency, societal
participation and a well-functioning whistle-blowing policy and procedures, particularly to
ensure sufficient financing for them during implementation. While it is impossible to
determine how KESSP might have evolved if all of the planned governance strengthening
measures had been implemented, it is clear that the slow pace of implementation raised
program risks substantially. Implementation of the KESSP governance and accountability
action plan may have been facilitated by focusing on a smaller number of strategic actions,
given limited Government capacity to undertake them. It is possible that the extensive
number of actions in the governance and accountability action plan were due to the review
processes among development partners, between development partners and the MoE, and
within the World Bank which placed pressure to build consensus, and incorporate
“suggestions? and requirements for additional measures, without due recognition of
implementation capacity. This pertains notably to the social accountability measures.

111. Greater reliance should be given to civil society organizations in monitoring
progress in the sector and in implementing accountability measures (including through
school report cards, expenditure tracking and sample studies of specific programs, etc.),
with careful monitoring of the selection process if the services are procured by the MoE.
There are many NGOs, CBOs and research institutions in Kenya with good technical
expertise that could be utilized, as demonstrated during the earlier years of KESSP, and
they could help to enlarge the capacity needed to undertake such work. In particular, more
impact might have been achieved from civil society involvement if they had participated
more in monitoring program achievements.

112. The appraisal of country sector plans should be strengthened to ensure the inclusion
of appropriate results measurement indicators and to set realistic targets. Bank projects
supporting SWAps could then use the same indicators and targets to measure project
results. The EFA-FTI is revisiting its guidelines to strengthen the appraisal process.

                                             32
113. Credible, robust and independent information and data should guide the design,
implementation, and financing of a SWAp. In the case of the KESSP, JFA partners took a
flexible, or what development partners considered a pragmatic approach, to the allocation of
donor financing that aimed to link resource allocations to credible strategies and
implementation results on an annual basis. However, a near exclusive reliance on MoE
information systems which were weak and uncoordinated made it difficult to generate robust
indicators necessary for planning and supporting effectiveness and efficiency in resource
targeting and utilization. While continued and more coordinated efforts need to be made to
understand the lack of progress in this domain and to strengthen the credibility of the
MoE’s data systems and indicators, the risk of making decisions based on questionable data
may be reduced by: (i) ensuring at the outset that there is an effectively functioning EMIS
that is capable of providing reliable data on the basic key indicators identified; (ii) using
periodic independent school sample surveys for school-level indicators to test the
credibility or margin of error of EMIS/MoE indicators and gather data for those for which
the EMIS is not suitable (e.g., textbook sharing ratios); (iii) exploiting the results of
household surveys for national and sub-national indicators to capture the experience of the
entire population not only of the children attending school (notably net and gross enrolment
ratios), and to explore specific policy-relevant issues on aspects that EMIS systems are not
designed to capture reliably (e.g. distance/time to school, private expenditure on education,
grade repetition, etc.); (iv) developing incentives (and sanctions) for schools and the MoE
to report accurately; and (v) undertaking more independent analytical work particularly in
expenditure analysis and exploiting MoE and survey data.

114. Putting in place a series of impact evaluations during Program implementing can
help to progressively develop informed policy decisions about scaling up specific
interventions as was done in the case of the KESSP. This was particularly relevant to the
school health interventions, to put in place the cost-effective measures such as deworming.

115. It is important to match up the program structure with the budget structure and to be
able to monitor total expenditures on priority programs. The structure, financing
mechanism and financial reporting of the KESSP made it extremely difficult to obtain
clarity on actual total expenditures on the KESSP programs, particularly FPE and FSE per
student grants, which captured the largest share of “KESSP? financing. The experience
illustrates the importance of matching the program structure with the budget structure, and
classifying budgetary resources and expenditures consistently across the sources of
financing.

116. Building systems leading to substantive policy development and strengthening
country systems (financial management and procurement) requires concerted collaboration
and predictable financing. In the case of the KESSP implementation, the development
partners exercised a positive role in supporting the KESSP review processes, engaging in
substantive policy dialogue and strengthening MoE financial management and procurement
systems. Less clear is the importance and predictability of the development partners’
financial contributions to the program. Although the financial resources provided by the
development partners are only a small share of total public expenditure, they represent a
large share of development expenditure in education. However, a large share of donor
                                             33
resources also financed some recurrent expenditures (e.g. the FPE grant) for which
resource predictability was extremely critical, but the donor resources channeled through
the pooled fund were not always predictable (which led the MoE to rely increasingly on
budgetary resources for these programs). The experience suggests that: (i) when the amount
of donor financing is a small share of total expenditure, the relevance of donors in the
sector will depend increasingly on the strength and credibility of their technical support,
and their ability to engage in technical and policy-dialogue and to connect to local
networks of researchers and relevant organizations agencies; and (ii) when donors wish to
finance recurrent expenditure, such as FPE grants, using country systems, there is little
obvious advantage in doing so through a pooled fund that finances the development budget.
Also with respect to development partner collaboration, the management of the JFA was a
weighty responsibility with associated costs. The partnership may have been more effective
with greater clarity and specificity in the roles and responsibilities of each partner in the
policy dialogue and program supervision, as well as in sharing the cost of supervision
responsibilities.

117. Finally, working in a sector-wide approach that aims to utilize country systems
requires strong, sustained and effective collaboration across the World Bank country team,
particularly: (i) with the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management department of the
World Bank on expenditure reviews, the design of household surveys, analyzing survey
data, and strengthening public financial management systems; and (ii) with the financial
management team on mitigating fiduciary risks. Given the governance issues in the
country and sector, it might prove useful to have: (i) a Bank team in the country comprising
staff of appropriate skills, dedicated to supporting the design and supervision of measures
to strengthen accountability, particularly social accountability, and transparency; and (ii)
reliable and sustained support from seasoned staff and commensurate resources to address
governance and fiduciary issues.

  In the table above, the Financing Gap is different from that figuring in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
(US$277). The proposed estimated amount (US$197) results from a proposed correction of the amount considered in the
PAD, which seems to have been overestimated.

Note: * Primary school instructional materials. The subprogram objective was to provide all public primary schools and non-formal schools with instructional materials in order to increase access and
address quality. This was to be achieved through the logical development of a continuous and well tested set of reforms in textbook financing through a basic decentralized instructional materials
system on which the IDA Free Primary Education Support Project procurement system was based, and one which was pioneered by a pilot project supported by the Dutch Government and launched in
Laikipia and Machakos Districts in 1996. From 1999 until 2006 the pilot project initiatives were further developed by the Government/ DFID SPRED 3 project, which extended the same basic
principles to every district in Kenya. These were successful, established programs for the provision of textbooks and other materials at primary level through the school level SIMBA account. There
was evidence from various studies that there were positive impacts of the materials support, especially, improvements in student retention and attendance, improved performance in school, and easing
the teaching challenge for teachers who were able to convey skills and knowledge more quickly, and enabling them to give homework assignments.

   The average pupil reading score dropped from 546 to 543, while the average mathematics score dropped from 563 to 557. However, these minor changes are not statistically significant. Also, a
simple comparison of test scores over time is misguided, as FPE brought about a very significant change in the composition of the student population in Kenya, as (i) dramatic growth in student
enrolments put downward pressure on per student investment, and (ii) user fee abolition was accompanied with flight from public schools. So the student populations tested by SACMEQ were, on
average, not fully comparable. It is also possible that the stable KCPE scores may have been due to score normalization, rather than stability in school quality. Yet, the KCPE scores increased faster in
the poorer districts, where student enrolment and class size growth were concentrated, even though higher class sizes are associated with lower growth in KCPE scores. A recent paper by Bold, Kemenyi,
Mwabu and Sandefur (2010) showed a widening public-private exam performance gap (and increased socio-economic sorting between public and private schools), but roughly zero change in overall
mean performance, despite an increase in the number of test-takers. So it appears that there was not a decline in the value added of public schools. Indeed, even though the public school population
shifted to "harder to teach" children, the mean performance remained stable, which is encouraging.

                              Annex 3: Project Development Outcomes

A.         Analysis and Rating Method: The following criteria were used to arrive at the
           ratings.

1.      As KESSP outcome targets and indicators remained the same during KESSP
implementation, progress was assessed against the extent to which progress was achieved
relative to the targets that were set, and according to how the outcome and output indicators
had been defined or were intended to be measured, as reflected in the KESSP PAD.

2.      As a general rule, and wherever possible, the rating was based on an assessment of
the level of attainment of the target defined as the change in the absolute value of the
indicator between the end year and the baseline relative to the change targeted. For
example, if the targeted change in the NER was 10 percentage points and the NER rose by
2 percentage points, 20 percent of the target was achieved. The following scale was used
as a guide: highly unsatisfactory for negative change, unsatisfactory for 0 <= change < 25
percent of the target; moderately unsatisfactory for 25 <= change < 50 percent of the target,
moderately satisfactory for 50 <= change <70 percent of the target, satisfactory for 70 < =
change < =80 of the target, and highly satisfactory for change > 80 percent of the target.

3.      The ratings also took into consideration the weight of the importance of the
indicator to the KESSP program. This criterion did not influence ratings to shift from the
unsatisfactory to the satisfactory side of the scale or vice versa. Rather, it helped to make
the finer distinctions and/or add additional justification for the ratings given. This applied
to two indicators – Government financial effort on primary education, and the availability
of textbooks.

4.      Where possible, the analysis underlying the assessment of progress drew from
published results from two types of sources: (i) data and indicators published by the MoE
in Statistical Bulletins, and (ii) data and indicators from the 2009 population census and
household surveys which are recognized as meeting an acceptable technical bar of quality
(namely the 2005 Kenya Integrated Budget and Household Survey, the 2005 Demographic
and Health Survey for enrolment indicators, and the 2009 NASLA for the textbook
indicator. There are advantages and disadvantages to using only the published data. With
respect to the surveys, the main advantages are: (a) given their technical quality, the results
are widely accepted and published by the GoK. The disadvantage is that access to the 2009
census data was limited to the national NER. For the MoE EMIS data, the advantage is
that they are the numbers effectively used by MoE and development partners to monitor
progress during KESSP implementation.35 The disadvantage is that the 2010 publication,
which was the latest available at the time of data collection for the ICR, stops at provisional
estimates for 2009. For more recent years, EMIS results were made available informally
for only a limited number of indicators because the underlying data have not yet been
sufficiently cleaned or stabilized for publication.



35
     EMIS data are also submitted to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics for international reporting.

                                                       50
5.      When ascertaining the extent of progress achieved for a particular indicator, both
MoE and survey results are presented where available and greater weight is given to survey
results for the following reasons. First, the EMIS data have validity and reliability issues
that are reflected in a high level of internal inconsistency and instability over time which is
magnified at disaggregated levels such as Province, gender and grade enrolments (Rotich et
al 2010). 36 The causes of the instability and margin of error that may be introduced as a
result have not been assessed. The Net Enrolment Ratio (NER) measure is also affected by
inconsistent measurement of both the numerator (enrolment) and denominator (school-aged
population) over time due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient coverage of private
school attendance, and highly inconsistent assumptions about population growth. The
impact of each on the estimation of the NER, and the conclusions that would be drawn
from those estimates, is not negligible.37 Second, in contrast, household surveys and the
population census have the following strengths: (i) consistency in how school attendance
was measured over time,38 (ii) a high level of technical quality that is documented and
widely acknowledged, and (iii) the merit of being self-contained in that the numerator (the
number of children attending primary school) is measured commensurately with the
denominator (the number of children of primary school age). Finally, the hypothesis that
household surveys measure “attendance? while the MoE measures “enrollment? which
would tend to be higher than attendance 39 does not appear to explain the difference
between household survey and MoE estimates as household surveys and population census
have consistently shown considerably more school-aged children attending school
compared with MoE enrolment figures.

6.     Finally, the potential impact that the exogenous shock of the 2008 post-election
violence may have had is given consideration as a mitigating factor as may be relevant.



36
   Internal inconsistency is most evident in the disconnect between grade-by grade enrolment and: (a)
reported dropout rates and (b) assumed low repetition (assumed because EMIS does not collect data on
repetition). As a result, Rotich et al, for example, conclude that dropout rates are underestimated and
completion rates are overestimated. Further, the reported enrolment bulge in 2003 that followed the
introduction of FPE is not evident in the EMIS data.
37
   With respect to private school attendance, development partners were aware of the problem and supported
a school mapping exercise to improve the capture of private schools. The survey began in 2007; and results
were made available and incorporated into the EMIS in 2009. The mapping exercise added at least 500,000
children to total enrolment for 2007. This adjustment accounted for over half the enrolment “increase?
registered by EMIS over 2005-2008. As the MoE NER series was not adjusted retrospectively to account for
the under-representation of private school attendance in prior years, a substantial part of the reported increase
in the NER relative to the KESSP baseline is attributable to this artifact. With respect to the school-aged
population, annual growth rates derived from the EMIS indicators (using reported total enrolment and Gross
Enrolment Ratios) yield a highly unlikely 0.51 percent in 2005, 0.20 percent in 2006, 8.9 percent in 2007, 2.6
percent in 2008 and 7.3 percent in 2009.
38
   All sources gathered school attendance by posing the same question namely, whether the child was
currently attending school, or in the case of the 2008 DHS whether the child had attended during the 2008
school year since the survey was conducted partially during a non-school period.
39
   This is because surveys may not count children who were not attending school at the time of the survey but
may have been in attendance at other times during the school-year.

1.     Introduction. The objective of the survey was to analyze views and perceptions of
beneficiaries on the extent to which the school investment program has had an impact on
educational improvement. A wide range of beneficiaries was considered, among them
primary school pupils and secondary school students, parents, teachers, headteachers, as
well as general community members. Specifically, the assessment sought to: (i) test the
awareness of communities regarding the KESSP school investment; (ii) collate perceptions
on school investment, that is, educational improvement; and (iii) gauge the impact of the
program. The findings of the beneficiary survey are summarized below.

2.     Methodology. The study applied a mixed methods approach, with wider utilization
of quantitative research. To reach a wider sample, generation of statistical data through
closed-ended questions was favoured, complemented by limited open-ended questions and
in-depth interviews.

2.1 Data collection methods and instruments
The study triangulated four methods, and utilized seven instruments.

                  Table 1: Data Collection Methods and Instruments

 1. School Data Sheet – 2 data sheets were used to collect enrolment, teacher and
    facility data, comparing status in 2005, 2007 and 2010;
 2. Questionnaire for primary school head teachers – this tool served to focus on key
    aspects of KESSP I, views on relevance of investment programs, and rating
    satisfaction with the various service delivery areas;
 3. Questionnaire for secondary school head teachers – collected data specific to the
    secondary school investment programs, on head teacher satisfaction, and view on
    impact created by the programme, views on next phase;
 4. Questionnaire for ECDE teachers – focused on the ECDE investment programme,
    with specific focus on receipt of community support grants, teacher training, and
    health and nutrition programmes;
 5. Questionnaire for pupils/students – sought views on improvement of service
    delivery, views on improvement, and rating importance of various investments in
    improving learning;
 6. Questionnaire for parents and local leaders – rated satisfaction with GoK’s
    investment in education, comparing past and current trends, and perspectives on the
    next phase;
 7. Short Message (SMS) feedback: SMS to head teachers of 1,000 schools, focusing
    positive change that has happened in their schools.

2.2 Sampling and Sample
The assessment was conducted in 22 randomly sampled districts (out of the 158 2009
census districts), constituting 14 percent of the districts. In each district, 2 villages were
randomly sampled to participate in the assessment. For each village, a public primary
school was reached, as well as the public secondary school nearest to the village. In each
village, interview was conducted with the chief or village elder, and also in four randomly
sampled households. In each primary school, the head teacher (or their representative) was
interviewed, the ECDE teacher, as well as ten children (five girls and five boys). In each
secondary school, the head teacher (or their representative) was interviewed, as well as ten
students. Table 2 summarizes the study sample, in 22 districts.

Two types of data were generated: quantitative data, generated through the data sheets and
closed-ended items of the questionnaires; and qualitative data, generated through the
interviews and open-ended items of the questionnaires. Quantitative data were coded using
Microsoft excel data base, and transferred to stata for generation of tables. Descriptive
statistics were used as basis of analysis. Qualitative data were coded manually, and codes
entered into the quantitative databases, while the rich quotations were singled out and
analyzed thematically.

3. Conclusions and Recommendations

      Head teachers are aware of KESSP, but ECDE teachers are largely unaware of
       sources and amounts of funding. The assessment has established that all head
       teachers (but one) are aware of the KESSP investment. However, ECDE teachers
       are largely unaware of whether their schools have received community grants or

                                             58
    not, leave alone the amounts. Seemingly, funding information is largely a preserve
    of the head teacher, at least in regard to ECDE funding. Perhaps, the lowly qualified
    teachers, working in a non-recognized sector, are hardly consulted in making
    decisions pertaining to developments in ECDE.

   Access to education has for sure expanded, but how much of this can be
    attributed to KESSP? While analysis of EMIS enrolment trends points to
    progressing, consistent rise in enrolment at all levels (after near stagnation in 2006),
    the assessment is unable to isolate the growth in enrolments from general
    population growth over the review period. Still, the expansion in enrolment seems
    to favour high potential agricultural districts, with lower gains in arid districts.

   Quality is improving, but the growing enrolment continues to overburden the
    facilities. The beneficiaries are appreciative to improvement in quality, brought
    about by the various interventions. However, beneficiaries view teacher shortage
    and inadequacy of learning materials as the leading markers of low quality in
    Kenyan public schools. At the ECDE level, payment of teachers and focus on child
    development are noted as challenges that require attention, beyond just education.
    Head teachers attribute teacher training to improvement in learning. However,
    whether teacher training may have meant reduction of time-on-task requires
    investigation, for this may mean reversal of the relationship between teacher
    training and learning, depending on how the training sessions are timed. Further
    on, doubt is casted, if training of ECDE teachers is making any impact, going with
    their poor academic disposition. It emerges, that the growing enrolment needs to be
    matching with increased resources, while it may be wiser to map school resource
    needs, and use this as the basis of allocation.

   INSET seems to be working well, but re-structuring pre-service training would
    be more sustainable. The positive attitude towards INSET may be an indicator
    that this programme has worked well. However, in the long run, it would be more
    strategic to restructure pre-service training. The many limitations of the teacher
    noted in the schools may also be an indicator of weak pre-service training. Focusing
    on this sub-sector, and investing more in it than in INSET, seems both strategic and
    sustainable.

   Access and quality may have improved, but the school mirrors the existing
    inequalities of the Kenyan society. Despite the gains in access and quality, it
    remains unclear, if the capitation has equitably improved quality, or if the funding
    has actually exasperated the existing inequalities in the Kenyan society. The
    beneficiary assessment has illustrated that inequalities still persist: gender
    inequalities, inequalities against the marginalized categories in arid lands, among
    nomadic communities and urban informal settlements. Though participation of local
    communities in managing schools has improved, the gains are challenged by
    continued eliticization, clanism and nepotism, especially in arid districts. In some
    districts, parents view participation in school management committees as preserve
    of the rich in their local communities.

Recommendations for the Future

   A. Access

      Act on the ‘compulsory’. For many decades, the government has been quiet on the
      compulsory bit of Kenyan basic education. Yet, the Kenyan constitution now comes
      out clearly, to entitle the child to basic education that is both free and compulsory.
      Some studies (ILO, 2009) have indicated that local administrators who have
      adopted the ‘compulsory’ have maintained nearly 100% enrolment of all eligible
      children in their villages, while making every effort to retain them in school. The
      Ministry must now come out to emphasize that basic education is compulsory, and
      work with local administration to enforce this.

      Implement the school distance norms, based on outcomes of the school mapping.
      In some villages in Turkana and Msambweni, among other sampled districts,
      beneficiaries site long distances to school as a major cause of non-attendance.
      Following the just-concluded school mapping exercise, it is critical to now focus on
      evidence-based implementation of school distance norms, starting with the
      disadvantaged areas.

      Work with partners and innovators, to focus on the hard-to-reach. The default
      increase in enrolment established by this study lacks impact on marginalized
      categories. To achieve, or even get nearer to Education for All by 2015, the
      Ministry of Education must seek to work with innovators in reaching the extremely
      marginalized. Rather than clinging only on the mobile schools, boarding schools
      and the few other alternative forms that have also shown limitation, a close look at
      civil society innovations that are delivering results in reaching children of nomadic
      families, children with disabilities (especially multiple), and children in urban
      informal settlements may help. The scientifically-proven interventions that are
      working must be packaged for countrywide replication, and this can only be
      achieved by the Ministry of Education. Sourcing for extra resources from the
      ministries of Northern Kenya and other arid lands, Ministry of Nairobi Metropolitan
      Development, and other key ministries may help accelerate the replication of these
      innovations.

      Strengthen Capacity of Schools and District Offices for Data Management and
      Utilization. The ineffectiveness and inaccuracies cited in the current model of
      EMIS seems to emerge from its over-centralized nature. Rather than just compiling
      data for forwarding, the head teachers and district education officers need to
      discover ways of analyzing this information, especially in the study of trends that
      should inform decision making at their levels. If head teachers were to be
      forwarding both raw and analyzed data, and the DEO’s do the same to the PDEs,
      and so on, the inaccuracies may be reduced, while still creating more reference data
      points for easier corroboration of EMIS.



                                           60
Quality

   Shift focus, from schooling to learning. Indeed, at least according to head teachers,
   KESSP has gone a long way in expanding access of children to the public school.
   However, assessments of learning outcomes (KNEC 2010, Uwezo 2010) point to
   dismal levels of learning outcomes at lower levels. Confirming this, most head teachers
   only make reference to improved mean scores, which may just mean systematic drilling
   of children at the expense of lifelong learning. And as a boy in Gucha South cries out,
   teachers may be focusing only on the few strong students to pull up the mean score. To
   manage this shift, the Ministry of Education must go back to the philosophy of our
   Kenyan education, and insist on learning from lower primary levels. Unless Kenyans
   acquire this broad-based education, it would be impossible to develop, even with the
   highest mean scores there can be. The MoE must now utilize the assessment of learning
   outcomes to shape new focus on teachers, materials, environments, contents and
   methods.

   Think beyond the allocation of the Ministry, to draw extra resources from other
   ministries and citizens. Seemingly, improving quality of schools can be responsibility
   of other ministries also. For instance, rural electrification has had focus on government
   institutions, and most schools have benefited from this. Similarly, it is more the
   responsibility of the Ministry of Water to see that children in schools have access to
   clean drinking water, the Ministry of Communication to see that young Kenyans have
   access to ICT, the Ministry of Public Health to ensure that children have access to
   proper nutrition and hygiene, the Ministry of Nairobi Metropolitan Development to see
   that the young generation has access to facilities, and the list can be countless.
   Packaging education as ‘everyone’s business’ can go a long way in not only drawing
   the strengths of other government ministries to improve schools, but spurring every
   citizen to take action.

Equity

   Like the Constituency Development Fund, allocate FPE and FSE funds equitably.
   The current system continues to aggravate inequalities, and indeed, the school perfectly
   mirrors the existing inequalities in the Kenyan society today. From an argument of
   social justice, it would be critical to focus more on marginalized categories. Rather than
   allocate a uniform amount for all children, work out formulas of increasing capitation
   for children and schools in arid districts and urban slums, while focusing on gender,
   special needs, geographical location and family backgrounds.

                    Annex 7: Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

1.      A Stakeholder Workshop was convened in Nairobi on May 13, 2011 to review the
draft Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR), including the findings of the
Beneficiary Assessment, for the Kenya Education Sector Support Project (KESSP) which
closed on December 31, 2010. The Chair for the Workshop was Mr. Kiminza Onesmus
(Senior Deputy Director for Policy, Partnership and the East African Community).
Participants included KESSP Secretariat staff and other senior officials from the Ministry
of Education (MoE)40, civil society organization representatives, development partners, and
World Bank staff and consultants. Representatives from the Ministry of Higher Education,
Science and Technology (MoHEST) and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) were unfortunately
unable to participate in the workshop due to scheduling issues.

Presentations

2.      Initial Presentation. Ms. Helen Craig (Lead Education Specialist and Human
Development Sector Leader for Kenya) made the initial presentation on the ICR draft
findings and ratings, on behalf of the World Bank team. The presentation was augmented
with details by Ms. Shobhana Sosale (current KESSP and ICR Team Leader) and Mr.
Michael Mills (former KESSP Team Leader). The team stressed that the judgments were
being based on the specific indicators which had been originally identified in the KESSP
design. Additional indicators provide a broader picture of the progress of the KESSP
activities.

3.      Beneficiary Assessment. Dr. Sara Ruto provided a summary of the findings of the
Beneficiary Assessment, which was based on three objectives: (i) to assess the awareness
of communities of the KESSP school investment program; (ii) to collate perceptions of
educational improvements; and (iii) analyze views on the impact of the KESSP
programme. Overall, Dr Ruto concluded that the beneficiaries interviewed were overall
quite positive about the KESSP. In particular, the Beneficiary Assessment showed that the
communities interviewed felt that (i) access to schooling had improved; (ii) the status of
infrastructure and learning materials had also improved; (iii) communities had become
more involved in the education of their children and in school management; and (iv) the
Government is keen to improve the education of children. They also felt that the
improvement in school infrastructure was linked to an improvement in student learning,
although there were concerns about increased pupil-teacher ratios in many of the
communities. The need for more teachers was mentioned as the greatest need.




40
   The MoE leadership and the secondary education team were unable to participate in the workshop due to a
regional workshop being held at the same time. The Workshop Chair gave their apologies for absence.


                                                   62
Main Issues Discussed

4.      Focus of the review. Clarity was sought as to whether the draft ICR findings
reflected the rating of the World Bank only on its own support to the KESSP, or on the
achievements and challenges of the entire government and donor supported Program. In
response, it was noted that it would be impossible to separate out the impact of the support
just from the World Bank, especially as the financial resources had been passed through a
pooled account. More broadly, it was agreed that the KESSP was based on a total
partnership, and that generally the attribution of specific achievements would be very
difficult. However, it was also recognized that some judgements could be made on the
respective performance on various parts of the program.

5.      The Rating Scale. The MoE and development partners posed questions about the
norms, definition and judgments used in the ratings scale for assessing the achievement or
absence of progress of the results indicators. For example, the “tipping point? between
“moderately unsatisfactory? and “moderately satisfactory? was explored. The Bank team
explained that the indicators were based on a specific rating scale and explanations to guide
the preparation of the ICR document. Appendix A of the ICR Guidelines was used as the
basis to explain that the ratings.

6.      Data sources. There was considerable discussion about data analysis and the
assessment of the achievement of the KESSP performance indicators using different data
sources, including (i) the Education Management Information System (EMIS), (ii) the
Kenya National Examinations Center (KNEC) data, (iii) survey data from the Demographic
and Health Survey (DHS), and (iv) the 2009 Census data (published in 2010). It was noted
that the EMIS data were erratic over time, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS)
had been underestimating population growth, and the EMIS had utilized the KNBS
population figures. In order to assess the likely trajectory of the performance of the
KESSP, the EMIS data was therefore considered to be questionable. It was further
emphasized that only the 1999 census data had been available at the time of the KESSP
design in 2005, and that therefore this had to be used as the underlying database for the
population figures. It was agreed that measuring progress using differing datasets is
difficult, but it was also pointed out that using a single data source (such as the EMIS)
would be unrealistic and that the data needed to be triangulated. It was also noted that the
EMIS data could have been artificially inflated, especially as schools had an incentive to
increase enrolment figures due to the capitation system of financing. In any event, there
was general agreement that the accuracy of the EMIS data has been questioned throughout
the KESSP implementation period, although, the MoE team felt strongly that the EMIS
data alone should be used for assessing the KESSP results. They indicated that the EMIS
has always been used in international fora to outline the progress made through the KESSP,
and noted that there needs to be consistency in using data to assess the KESSP indicators.
Some development partners, especially the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), also
cautioned against using the 2009 census data ex-post to assess the progress made in the
KESSP, since it was not available when the MoE commenced. In addition, UNICEF
pointed out that (i) there are always issues relating to the exact phrasing of questions in



                                             63
surveys, (ii) the survey data might not be fully representative, and (iii) a continuous dataset
is needed to assess progress rather than a point estimate.

7.      Enrolments. There was a particular discussion on the Net Enrolment Rate (NER).
It was first noted that the EMIS data showed the 2010 NER to be around 93 percent, and
that this fell short of the 100 percent NER goal that MoE had established for itself. In
response, the MoE pointed out that the NER of 100 percent is an aspirational policy and
that the policy is for all children to have access to schooling. However, it was also pointed
out that the survey data do not show an increase in the NER, despite the growth rate for
overall enrolments. UNICEF pointed out that maintaining the NER at a relatively high
level is major progress, even if the target is not met, and that the NER indicator needs to be
seen from this perspective. DFID stressed that there is a need to look at the whole story
about enrolments and what happened.

8.      Learning achievements. There was also a major discussion about learning
achievements, as measured by: (i) the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and
the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE); (ii) surveys, and especially the
Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ);
and (iii) the National Assessment for Measuring Student Learning Achievements
(NASLA). The key issue was to assess whether the educational activities through the
KESSP had contributed towards increasing, keeping constant or decreasing learning
achievements. The expert views of the KNEC representatives were sought about the rating
of the learning achievements under the KESSP, especially as the findings of the
Beneficiary Assessment and the draft ICR rating seem to be contradictory. In response, the
KNEC representatives stated that: (i) overall, although learning is increasing, competencies
are low; (ii) the SACMEQ data show flat learning achievements in Kenya as a whole; (iii)
in terms of provincial disparities, some provinces such as the North Eastern Province did
better during the KESSP period; (iv) if average learning stays more or less constant with
big increases in enrolment numbers, and more hard-to-reach children are brought into the
system, this is a significant achievement; and (v) there is a slight improvement in
performance in KCPE, although not at a significant level. It was also noted that the
findings of the Beneficiary Assessment were based on beneficiaries’ own perceptions.

Ministry of Education Perspective and Conclusions

9.       Conclusions

        On the use of the EMIS versus survey data, the discussion was somewhat
         inconclusive, since it was pointed out that there is a major disconnect between
         EMIS and survey data. However, it was agreed that all available data should be
         used where relevant.

        While there is agreement about the EMIS data, the rating of the indicators depends
         on a judgment call which needs to be informed by the overall storyline. For
         example, overall enrolments did increase during the KESSP period. Even though


                                              64
       NER was flat with population growth, the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) shows
       improvement.

      Development partners pointed out that the qualitative context for the KESSP is
       unclear in the ICR report. There was general agreement that a lot of progress had
       been made in setting up better systems, and that both quantitative and qualitative
       data should be used together to arrive at the final ratings.

      It was agreed that the World Bank’s analysis is very important, that it will be taken
       very seriously by many people, and that the ICR document will be widely
       consulted. Therefore, the language in the ICR document needs to be carefully
       reviewed, to ensure a balance between the Program achievements and the
       challenges faced, and to provide a clearer articulation of the ratings.

      Finally, it was agreed that an assessment of future investments in the sector need to
       include: (i) sustaining the gains; (ii) reaching the hard-to-reach which is relatively
       more expensive; (iii) improving policy-making, based on more accurate data; and
       (iv) addressing the issue that some development partners are now bypassing country
       systems, due to lack of confidence in the country systems.

10.     Ministry of Education. In conclusion, the MoE team felt that the draft ICR
conclusions: (i) were very negative about the KESSP activities, with a disproportionate
stress on the governance and financial management issues; (ii) did not seem to highlight the
KESSP achievements sufficiently, especially as it was a complex sectorwide program, and
warranted a more holistic analysis; and (iii) should have been shared in its entirety with the
MoE and MoHEST teams before the workshop. In addition, the MoE team challenged the
standards and definitions of the ratings used (namely, Satisfactory, Moderately
Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, and Unsatisfactory).

11.    Next Steps. It was noted that the ICR document would shortly go through the
World Bank review and clearance process. Serious consideration could also be given to
using the ICR document as the end-KESSP Phase I (2005-2010) assessment for the
Program as a whole. However, it was noted that there should be another process and
review meeting for all stakeholders to conclude regarding the KESSP.

KESSP Co-ordination

Four central themes of this programme are: transparency; decentralization; team work; and
performance-based management and accountability. These themes determine the way the
programme is implemented and monitored.

A key coordinating body for KESSP is the Programme Steering Committee which is
chaired by the Education Secretary, and involves all the Directors at Headquarters, Chief
Executives of Semi-Autonomous Government Agencies, and departmental heads in the
MOE and MOHEST. This Committee meets monthly and is accountable for KESSP
implementation. The KESSP Reform Secretariat is a small team from MOE and MOHEST
staff, under the Policy and Planning Directorate to support the entire secretariat comprising
all investment team leaders, who report to the KESSP Steering Committee.

This team is responsible for coordination, monitoring and impact evaluation, programme
documentation and reporting, and advisory support to KESSP Management Units.

The following are the KESSP objectives/targets:

      Attainment of UPE and EFA by 2015;
      Achievement of a transition rate of 70 percent, from primary to secondary school
       from the current rate of 47 percent, paying special attention to girls’ education by
       2008;
      Enhancement and sustainability of access, equity and quality in primary and
       secondary school education through capacity building for 45,000 education
       managers by the end of 2005;
      Construction/renovation of physical facilities/equipment in public learning
       institutions in disadvantaged areas, particularly in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands
       (ASALs) and urban slums by 2008;
      Development of a national training strategy for TIVET in 2005, and ensure that
       TIVET institutions are appropriately funded and equipped by 2008;
      Achievement of 50 percent improvement of levels of adult literacy by 2010;
      Expansion of public universities to have a capacity of at least 5,000 students each
       by 2015; and
      Increased proportion of all students studying a science related courses to 50 percent,
       with at least one third of these being women by the year 2010.

Achievements

During the implementation of KESSP, in order to address access, quality, equity and
relevance in education, policies, strategies and guidelines have been developed. These
include: (i) Education sector policy on HIV & AIDS; (ii) National school health policy;
(iii) Gender policy in education; (iv) Policy framework for nomadic education in Kenya;

                                             66
(v) Policy for alternative provision of basic education and training; (vi) National adult and
continuing education policy; (vii) ECDE policy; (viii) TIVET strategy; (ix) Secondary
strategy; (x) University strategy. Finally, financial and procurement procedures manuals
were developed for strengthening Governance and Accountability in the education sector.

Challenges encountered in implementation of KESSP Phase I (2005-2011)

The programme has been faced with challenges; the main one being a large unfinished
agenda for primary and secondary education especially as regards quality improvement and
providing access to the children that are currently out of school, especially the hard-to-
reach. Other aspects include:
     Under funding of or no funding for some investment programs despite
       prioritization, costing and being eligible.
     Delay in implementation of programs, thereby reducing effectiveness.
     Non-adherence to the JFA terms, such as delay in funds disbursements on a timely
       basis.
     Variation in exchange rate and conversion to Kshs. This caused a problem in
       writing of books.
     Lack of or little attention being given to efficiency gains across investment
       programs.
     Lack of alternative financing arrangements; all financing was based on the JFA.
     The link between performance indicators to the investment programs was weak,
       which impacted negatively on coordination/management.
     Phase I of KESSP was implemented as a pilot since it had not been tried before and
       therefore errors were encountered.
     Lack of adequate capacity building arrangements to meet management gaps.
     Lack of an approved M&E framework to improve management aspects.
     Human resource capacity: too few officers for too many tasks.
     Slow process of attitude change amongst our people.
     High cost of investment programs.
     Lack of capacity to develop well thought out and realistic work plans and
       procurement plans.
     Low procurement capacity especially at school level.
     High bureaucracy.
     The low capacity of Quality Assurance and Standards officers to deliver services in
       relation to the staffing levels and skills.
     The low capacity of School Audit to audit all schools regularly.
     Though there has been marked achievement towards the realizing universal primary
       education in the country, the attainment of the MDGs and EFA continue to
       experience a number of challenges such as: (a) weak local level partner
       participation i.e. the community and their leaders; (b) high turnover of school
       leadership especially in Primary Schools. SMC (elected every year) bringing in
       untrained leadership; (c) unsupportive public (education in a government service);
       and (d) unwillingness of many Kenyans to complain formally of alleged misdeeds.


                                             67
   ECDE sub-sector is marked by a high turnover of trained teachers (estimated at
    40% annually) and low participation rates especially in arid and semi-arid lands and
    urban slums.
   Overcrowding in schools especially those in urban informal settlements, arid and
    semi-arid lands areas, and densely populated areas.
   Inadequate physical facilities due to increased enrolments and dilapidated
    infrastructure.
   High pupil/teacher ratios in some schools as a result of inadequate teachers.
   High cost of special equipment/facilities and materials to cater for children with
    special needs.
   Low quality of education offered in Non-Formal Schools and Non-Formal
    Education Centres and lack of clear linkage with the formal education system.
   Many of the OVCs and NFE service providers are registered under different
    organizations including Government Departments, such as under the Office of the
    Vice President, Attorney General Chambers, Social Services and NGOs. Existence
    of many private NFS that charge fees to the poor. Very few NFSs and NFECs are
    registered by Ministry of Education making it difficult to extend Government
    support to the NFE sub-sector.
   Inadequate in-servicing of teachers to adopt alternative methods of curriculum
    delivery especially for the hard-to-reach children.
   Low transition rates from primary to secondary and underutilized capacity in
    TIVET sub-sector leading to very high wastages.
   Diminished support from communities mainly due to poverty.
   Gender, socio-economic and regional disparities that impact negatively on access,
    retention, participation and quality.
   Regional variations of female to male literacy ratios pose challenges to the national
    literacy achievements.
   HIV/AIDS pandemic that has robbed the country of trained and experienced
    teachers and given rise to many additional orphans in schools. It is estimated that
    1.8 percent of the country’s 245,000 teachers are dying annually. HIV/AIDS is
    draining the supply of education, eroding its quality, weakening demand and access,
    drying up the countries pool of skilled workers and increasing sector cost which is
    already high in relation to available public resources. The number of AIDS orphans
    and other vulnerable children now is estimated to number about 1.2 million.
   The Adult and Continuing Education (ACE) sub-sector faces the challenge of
    relatively low enrolments in relation to the estimated 4.2 million functionally
    illiterate adults due to low funding of the sub sector compared to other sub-sectors
    and inadequate teaching personnel who are also unmotivated. And
   The realization of girls and women’s empowerment through education has been
    impeded by a number of other factors such as cultural and religious attitudes and
    practices, infrastructural limitations, poverty, HIV/AIDS, lack of community
    awareness as well as lack of adequate female role models especially in some rural
    areas. In some areas the boy child suffers from child labor practices and lack of
    male role models especially in the poor urban slums.

Constraints and challenges to university education: (i) Inadequate teaching/learning
material; (ii) inadequate teaching staff especially teacher with PhD qualification; (iii)
inadequate physical facilities especially in new university colleges; (iv) low proportion of
women to men in science and technical courses; and (v) limited dissemination of research
results.

Issues relating to Governance and Anti-Corruption (GAC) and Risk Policy
Management (RPM)

The Ministry is committed to strengthening Governance and Accountability in the sector.
Since the introduction of Free Primary Education, the Ministry has put in place Governance
and Accountability mechanisms geared towards: (a) efficient service delivery; (b) enhanced
transparency; and (c) prudence and resources utilization.

Good governance is a principle in which political and management processes translate the
will of the people into public policies and establish the rules that efficiently and effectively
deliver services to all members of the society. In the context of Kenya’s education sector
good governance, as a means to enhance accountability, was critical to the attainment of
the KESSP I objectives of access, equity and quality. Since 2005 Governance and
Accountability annual reports and action plans for the education sector have been prepared
every year; these have been shared with the Development Partners and local stakeholders.
To build on the Education Sector Governance and Accountability Action Plan (2007) and
to address emerging issues in the sector, MOE is implementing Governance, and Anti-
Corruption (GAC) And Risk Policy Management (RMP) Action Plan (2010).The Plan
includes actions that will elicit organizational and culture change in the institutions
managing Programs at MOE Headquarters and decentralized level.

The GAC plan was prepared with the joint effort of Development partners and the Ministry
of Education. The action plan has been implemented and the status is as follows:
     GAC and RPM action plan has been prepared and implemented to address
       systematic failures;
     GAC & RPM prepared enhances, effective monitoring (participants’ evaluation of
       trainings, list of participants with signatures, and the organizers’ training report,
       participants’ ID numbers), and documentation of the capacity development events
       are a requirement in accounting for funds on capacity building;
     Regulations on allowances in capacity development are being enforced;
     Costed work plans prepared by all directorates and a template developed and in use
       to ensure the laid down procedures are strictly followed;
     Treasury circular on district allowances with respect to accommodation, transport,
       expenditure and authorization of imprests has been enforced (MoE has issued
       circulars on imprests);
     Training on corruption risk assessment and corruption prevention plan is part of all
       capacity building initiative;
     Management Manuals and Handbooks being revised by a consultant and
       recommendations of IAD report to be addressed;


                                              69
      Ministerial integrity audit committee in place;
      Social accountability mechanisms strengthening is ongoing (service charters
       developed at province and district levels, educational institutions displaying fund
       disbursed on notice boards);
      Procurement, accounting and audit issues raised in the GAC are being addressed (a
       capacity building strategy in Public Financial Management is being developed by
       MOE, MOF and Development Partners); and
      An increasingly important part of financial and procurement management has been
       decentralized to school level in order to allow more community participation,
       efficiency and adherence to school priorities. Guidelines in the form of manuals and
       handbooks have been developed and distributed up to the schools and education
       institutions. Structures - most importantly District Education Boards - have been
       established and capacity building efforts have been continuous.

Despite the progress made with regard to service delivery there are still important
challenges, including: (i) the high turnover of key personnel: head teachers, education
officers, and SMC/BOG members and low levels of education of the latter; (ii) ambiguity
about the responsibility for education decisions in an increasingly decentralised system is
exacerbated by a system of shared responsibilities that makes it difficult to hold any single
actor accountable; (iii) MOE communication strategy which is not fully operationalised
and needs to become more proactive; (iv) poor compliance with established procedures for
record keeping and transmission of information with regard to financial management and
procurement; (v) too many instances where of SMCs and BOGs do not perform their roles
and duties effectively; (vi) absence of a system that ensures high quality of work by
auditors and QASOs at all levels; and (vii) absence of a capacity building program that has
not reached many of the large number of education and oversight staff involved and that
has not provided much follow-up school and institutional support and training.

To accelerate progress towards the goal of good governance and financial and service
delivery accountability MOE/MOHEST have decided on a strategy that aims to (i) increase
client voice by involving them in management; (ii) link responsibility to a specific actor
(iii) rationalize responsibilities under decentralization by identifying and eliminate overlaps.
The elements of the strategy are:

    Strengthening communications. A two way flow of information from Ministry to
     clients will be established. Parents and other stake holders will be sensitized to play
     their roles in school/institutional governance. Information will be released to the
     general public using the most appropriate medium to reach the relevant target group.

    Increasing transparency and accountability. The Ministry has embraced Rapid
     Results Initiative, Results Based Management, and more recently Risk Based Audit
     and more recently the Value for Money Audit as approaches that make explicit
     expected results, establish accountabilities for achieving them, identify and manage
     potential risks, strengthen and make explicit targeting procedures. Benefiting
     institutions and schools will be required to display accounts and institutional charters
     on notice boards for public to perusal and scrutiny.

                                              70
   Promoting Integrity. MOE/MOHEST will ensure that the flow of funds from the
    Ministries’ Headquarters to the point of expenditure is clean, open, and honest with
    clearly defined criteria for disbursement and guidelines for expenditure and feedback.
    M&E will be extended to district and zonal level structures. Fiduciary controls will
    be strengthened. Procedures for auditing the use of public funds will be significantly
    tightened to fight and expose corruption and fraud and sanctions will be vigorously
    enforced.

   Enhancing responsiveness and participation. Decentralization of decision making
    in education either through devolution to lower levels of government or through
    delegation of responsibilities to the school and other institutions of learning has the
    potential for stronger accountability and improved governance. MOE will strengthen
    the capacity of school/other institutional level organizations like Parents Associations
    (PA), Parents Teachers Association’s (PTA’s), BOG’s SMC’s and Schools
    Instructional Materials Management Committee (SIMMC) to enable parents and
    communities to participate effectively in school level governance.

Lessons Learned

      Need for continuous capacity building programs for teachers education
       administrators and managers are key.
      Need for continuous reassurance and confidence building to avoid stakeholders
       giving up.
      Display of leadership, accountability, political will, transparency, and commitment
       all levels of governance.
      Need for continuous review of FPE/UPE policy.
      Communication strategy should be in place.
      Review of capitation grants from time to time reflecting inflation trends.
      Consistency in staff managing FPE programs.
      Direct disbursements to schools removed red tape.
      Partnerships have been guided by partnership principle.
      MOE and partners have been undertaking intensive financial monitoring but
       scattered leakages are still emerging. And
      Operational financial and procurement manuals have helped a great deal in program
       implementation.

        Annex 9: Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

I.     Department for International Development (DFID): Summary of Findings of
a Project Completion Report, April 2010

1.      Summary. KESSP has brought major benefits and positively changed the
management of development activity, mutual expectations among partners and ways of
working in MoE. It is clear that MoE is committed to its programme and is unlikely to
return to a project mode. However, MoE’s reputation has been severely damaged by the
findings of fraud and corruption. MoE’s leadership has not offered a convincing response
which has resulted in cessation of external funding and paralysis of programme activities.
Additionally, the means of assessing KESSP progress are not as robust and credible as they
could be. Nevertheless, there is enough evidence to show that the programme has been on
a positive trajectory but many targets will not be attained by June 2011. The strongest
progress has been in increasing primary education enrolments; the weakest area is in
respect of serving the poorest and most disadvantaged populations.

2.      Achievements. KESSP is now the reference point for all education development
and a vehicle for national/international goals. All proposed new developments are only
considered in the light of this sector programme and strategy. The programme can be seen
to be spurring decentralization. Similarly, KESSP is building a planning culture. MoE
officers, practitioners, public servants and most development partners expect now to
combine efforts to support an overall sector strategy.

3.      The most notable achievement has been the massive increase in access,
demonstrated by greatly improved net enrolment ratios (92.5 percent compared with 83.2
percent in 2005, with close gender parity). Other notable achievements include increased
transition to secondary school and improved textbook to pupil ratios, with the target of 1:1
achieved in some schools. The physical environment has been greatly improved through
infrastructure development and although there is much further work to be done most
stakeholders refer to visible improvements. There has been an effective model of school-
based teacher development which other countries seek to emulate. Raising quality is now
firmly on the agenda and there is increased attention to learning achievement. Also,
important to the sustainability of developments has been the raft of policy development.
Some (e.g. TIVET, universities and the planned Open University) are still awaiting
Cabinet/parliament approval but they are in the pipeline and will support major reforms in
these areas.

4.      Some Shortcomings. The topics listed in this paragraph reflect some points arising
very frequently over the past five years, consistently recorded in aides memoire and
validated by the DFID evaluation team:
 the high number (possibly more than 1,000,000) of out-of-school “missing children? -
    the most vulnerable, poorest and marginalized
 weak monitoring and evaluation, unreliable data
 insufficient community involvement (for accountability and support)
 a narrow conceptual approach to capacity building

                                            74
   expanding access at the expense of quality
   inadequate approach to teacher management
   curriculum insufficiently geared to students’ expectations, livelihood opportunities,
    national aspirations and labour market needs.

5.      The evaluation team also notes the following factors that need to be borne in mind
in the future:
 The prevalence of corruption in GoK systems, and MoE in particular, is well known
    yet development partners’ confidence in financial management rose over the first four
    years of KESSP shedding doubt on the efficacy of internal audit systems, financial
    reporting and on development partners’ routine monitoring (though it is important to
    acknowledge that the uncovering of fraud was triggered by a World Bank supervision
    mission).
 Post-election chaos and an increased volume of work in the Infrastructure Unit
    permitted undue involvement of senior MoE officers in infrastructure transactions,
    over-rode laid down procedures and provided an opportunity for corruption.
    Preoccupation with the extra activities and concerns about their quality engaged
    development partners and deflected attention from rumours of fraud.
 Lack of clarity regarding who (which development partner? which MoE unit?)
    should take what form of action resulted in rumours not being acted upon while those
    alleging corruption did not provide firm evidence due to fear of retribution and the
    absence of a convincing “whistle-blowing? policy.
 Review processes have become increasingly stale and seen more as events. External
    representation tends to be token. There is scope for greater externality from a wider
    range of stakeholders for more creative design and more challenging analysis.
 The flow of funds to KESSP has been stop-start and disbursements delayed year
    on year creating an end of year funding bulge that could not be easily spent and which
    fosters expediency. Non-pooled funding is not captured in financial reporting. The
    budget setting process is based on vote heads rather than programme outputs.
 There has been pragmatic rather than prioritized spending on investment
    programs. The budget process tends to be a “bidding? game (where wish-list
    workplans generate bids for high funding allocations which cannot feasibly be
    absorbed).
 The application of standard formula for school-level funding ignores the fact that
    some schools require more support than others.
 There has been insufficient inter-Ministerial collaboration and coordination
    (between the MOE, MOHEST, MOF and sister Ministries dealing with training and
    education). Similarly, there has been inadequate synergy across the KESSP investment
    programs and inadequate partnership with civil society organizations and with the
    private sector.
 Relatedly, more analytical research could play a part in informing evidence-based
    policy and planning.

6. Lessons Learned from point to the need to strengthen several key design and
implementation processes going forward as follows:


                                           75
     The need to build robust M&E systems which draw on accurate and timely EMIS
      data is a major priority. From the start, major weaknesses in the monitoring and
      evaluation of investment program work plans against key indicators and the lack of
      reliable baselines were identified.
     Combating corruption requires a combination of “bottom-up? with “top-down?
      accountability approaches. The “bottom-up? approach would include strengthening
      the community and school level focus of KESSP through the decentralization of
      management and delivery of education services. The “top-down? approach is likely to
      involve an extra inspection system for quality assuring internal audits. It will also be
      necessary to engage Parliamentarians in demanding greater accountability and in
      scrutinizing senior management/sector performance.
     Clearer roles and responsibilities, and better communication between and within
      each level of the education system, are also needed.
     Better coordination of the technical assistance provided by development partners
      is needed with a greater focus on developing human resource capacity at all levels of
      the system to build management systems that are transparent and have clear lines of
      accountability.
     It is necessary to examine the political (economy) context in which KESSP was
      operating. Authoritarianism, corruption and ethnically driven politics illustrate the
      backdrop of poor governance at the most senior levels.

7. Conclusion. With more than 500,000 children still out of school, most of whom live in
arid and semi-arid lands and urban slums and who are often the poorest and most
vulnerable, reaching these children is the greatest challenge going forward. The greatly
delayed and still inconclusive Mid-Term Review represents a major lost opportunity,
particularly for yielding lessons. DFID is designing bilateral project-style support to the
education sector for the balance of the present KESSP’s duration. DFID support of this
kind (linked to key KESSP outputs) has previously proved highly effective.

II.      Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA): Comments

Context at appraisal of KESSP

     At the time of KESSP appraisal, CIDA had been supporting the education sector in
      Kenya since 1998. CIDA worked in an incremental manner using varied funding
      mechanisms, including delegated cooperation DFID, all the while working towards
      more strategic and effective cooperation with the MoE.
     CIDA’s increasing involvement with MoE was made possible by the strong
      engagement and significant achievements made by GoK in the education sector and
      positive trends in governance.
     During the inauguration of KESSP in 2005, the then Ministry of Education Science and
      Technology adopted a sector-wide approach to program planning (SWAp). The
      Ministry was in full control of the process due to the political will prevailing then.
     When CIDA considered joining the pooled fund for KESSP, several donors had already
      made substantial commitments: DFID (US$100 million), the Fast Track Initiative (FTI)
      Catalytic Fund (over US$100 million) and IDA (US$80 million). The decision to

                                              76
    contribute to the pooled fund was based on a review of fiduciary risks and related
    financial management and procurement issues. CIDA used several highly credible
    sources to evaluate the potential risks, including the World Bank Detailed Integrity
    Report, the World Bank KESSP Project Appraisal Document, the Public Expenditure
    and Financial Accountability Evaluation (SIDA, June 2006); the Country Integrated
    Fiduciary Assessment (World Bank, September 2006); the Kenya Governance Report
    (World Bank, December 2006) and the Fiduciary Risk Assessment (DFID, September
    2005). In addition, CIDA tasked a procurement consultant to complete a desk review of
    available procurement-related documents, including those mentioned above. The due
    diligence undertaken by the team of advisors was consistent with requirements
    contained in CIDA’s Operational Guide on PBAs (2005).

Factors that contributed to Implementation success

   Established sector review process (JBRW and JRES) for work plans and progress
   Strong Donor coordination
   Comprehensive and clear sector plan
   Strong GoK financial support to KESSP
   Political will and strong leadership at the MOE
   Policy dialogue between development partners and MoE, especially through JFA
    partners
   Framework for partnership (e.g., partnership principles) between GoK and development
    partners
   Stronger development partner alignment, coordination and harmonization through the
    Education Donors’ Coordination Group, JFA, and HAC and lower transaction costs of
    implementation
   KESSP linked to Medium Term Expenditure Framework and PER
   Flexibility in financial modalities (pooled funding and project support)


Factors that gave rise to implementation challenges

   Inadequate financial accountability and delays and weaknesses in production of FMRs
   Inadequate infrastructural development in schools
   High staff turnover at the MOE
   Inadequate number of teachers
   Inadequate human resource recruitment and development at the MOE
   Lack of comprehensive capacity development plan
   Weak implementation capacity of districts and schools
   Poor quality of district and school development plans
   Lack of implementation of actions and recommendations agreed at JRES and JBRWs
   Inadequate KESSP sensitization, training and capacity development of SMCs
   Inadequate financial and procurement training of head teachers
   Lack of planning, coordination and synergy among the multi partners school
    infrastructure support such as KESSP, CDF, LATF, and others

                                           77
      Inadequate capacity to implement governance and accountability plan
      Weak supervision of curriculum implementation at school level due to inadequate
       number of quality assurance and standards staff
      Lack of comprehensive in-service primary teacher training program
      Inadequate use of SACMEQ II for quality improvement
      Inadequate inter-ministerial coordination
      Lack of internal communication between different MoE directorates and investment
       program leaders
      Lack of KESSP communications strategy

M&E design, implementation, and utilization

      EMIS capability to collect, synthesize, store and retrieve data and information.
      M&E designed as an investment program with very little coordination with other
       investment programs which have M&E as integral part.
      Inadequate monitoring of KESSP results framework
      Inadequate EMIS training at district and school level
      Inadequate utilization of EMIS for planning purposes
      Delayed and inadequate Mid-Term Review MTR

Results and outcomes of interventions in the context of the objectives

      KESSP is credited with several achievements, as evidenced by improvements in a
       number of education indicators. However, quality of education remains a serious
       challenge and financial and program management requires considerable strengthening,
       as highlighted in the extended audit report.
      Inadequate monitoring of KESSP logframe (logic model) and performance indicators
       (especially related to quality).

III.      UNICEF

Success Factors of KESSP
o KESSP opened up opportunities for engagement with civil society to improve
   coordination of activities and fostered partnership and coordination at district level (e.g.
   the Coalition of Civil society in education was invited to the Education Donors’
   Coordination Group and JRES meetings improving advocacy for government support
   towards diverse interventions.

o      Created a platform to harmonize the agenda around equity and disparity addressing
       vulnerable groups and disadvantaged geographical areas such as arid and semi-arid
       lands and urban informal settlements. Most donors/NGOs presented research findings
       on respective supporting areas which are often in urban informal settlements, pockets
       of poverty etc. This information was factored into KESSP expenditure items- a very
       good example is FPE grants given to Non-Formal Schools, support to Mobile schools
       for nomads, prioritization of pro- poor policies such as children in arid and semi-arid


                                               78
    lands, nomadic populations, children in in-formal education institutions, gender policy
    etc.

o   EDCG played the key coordination role in the first five years of KESSP
    implementation. The Education Donors’ Coordination Group had monthly meetings on
    status of program implementation; shared information of donor funded activities and
    consolidated priorities for a quarterly meeting with PS education- a great opportunity
    for implementation improvement. (However, the role has shifted to fiduciary audit
    monitoring – missing the opportunity in monitoring education indicators and progress
    towards MDGs.)

o   JRESs and Budget Reviews benefitted from high level attention from policy makers
    and significantly contributed to participatory monitoring of (a) implementation levels of
    different investment priorities, (b) prioritization of key education investment
    opportunities for the next coming year, and (c) joint problem identification and solving
    – the PS, directors and other decision makers in the Ministry attended the sessions and
    trips, where the issues within the education sector were jointly identified and
    confirmed, and aide-memoire addressing findings and agreements on ways forward
    were developed.

General issues with KESSP
o Too many investment plans and indicators: it is difficult to track the development. The
  design of the M&E framework leaves many questions e.g., how the MOE and
  development partners are to monitor 74 indicators without having systems in place and
  responsibilities assigned to track progress against these.

o   Lack of Harmonization and Prioritization: the KESSP is not seen as a sector
    programme but rather as a very large project consisting of many smaller projects. This
    is partly due to the capacity and ownership at different levels at MOE.

o   Misunderstanding around the SWAp concept, including KESSP and JFA: the KESSP is
    a government programme and government sector strategy with donors’ inputs.
    Therefore, educational intervention that is made should be considered as “within?
    KESSP, unless one implements a project which is thoroughly not related to government
    priority. The JFA is a financial modality to pool development partners fund to support
    a part of KESSP.

Results of Fraud and Financial Audit
o We have lost not only millions of shillings but also valuable opportunities due to the
   discovery of fraud and subsequent fiduciary audit, including
        Financial resources allocated to the Ministry;
        Opportunities for monitoring education development in last two years;
        Investment opportunities to children in school;
        Coherency among the Education Donors’ Coordination Group partners;
        Partnership and trust with the Ministry,



                                             79
            Speed in implementation of activities across the board, MOE and development
             partners.
            The SWAp approach: diversion from government support to NGO-run projects,
             which reduces institutional capacity of the Ministry, is being observed.

o     These direct outcomes following the extended forensic audit need to be addressed in
      the development of KESSPII, especially the issue regarding the fact that the coherency
      among Education Donors’ Coordination Group partners is getting weak and more and
      more activities are geared towards project based activities bypassing the Ministry. This
      is a return to where we were about 15 years ago. The focus should be on how we could
      improve our Education Donors’ Coordination Group coordination mechanism based on
      what we have experienced.

Challenges of KESSP
o Actual monitoring activities on education progress has ceased after the audit.
o Input-Focus: there is very little discussion on results and outcomes of interventions.
  There seems to be little link between the review process and implementing directorates.
o Over-estimation of the capacity of MOE: although it was designed that the plans in
  KESSP are to trickle down to the district level, it did not happen due to the capacity
  limitation of Ministry.

Overview of KESSP I

The implementation of KESSP has been both exciting and challenging to the government,
development partners and communities as well with lots lessons learnt. This far, the
programme can be celebrated for having made considerable contribution towards
increasing access to education, increased retention rates and improved transition from
primary to secondary and increased resource base for funding education. According to
Ministry of Education documents, KESSP has seen enrolment at primary increase with Net
Enrolment Rate (NER) at 92.5% from 83.2% within the same period. At the same time
drop-out rate at primary school declined from 6.5% to 3.5% while completion rate
increased to 79.5% from 77.6%. Transition from primary to secondary increased from
57.3% to 64.1% in 2008. (MoE Educational Statistical Booklet, 2009)

Within the broader sense of the programme it could be said that the KESSP concentrated so
much on the government’s goal on realization of Universal Primary Education
demonstrated by the commitment on Free Primary Education which has seen education
continue to receive a big chunk of the budgetary allocation averaged at more than 17% of

   EYC was established in 1999 as a national coalition of civil society organizations, professional groupings,
education/research institutions and other non state actors in Kenya’s education sector to lobby for the
implementation of EFA goals. Registered as a network of the National Council of NGOs, and utilizing a
rights-based approach, EYC brings together up to 50 CSOs involved in efforts to domesticate the EFA Goals
and other related global conventions for the attainment of quality basic education for all in Kenya.

the national budget over the last 3 years. While these statistics look encouraging, many
challenges continue to face education especially for the urban poor and those in far flung
pastoralists’ communities. Studies by Uwezo Kenya and National System for Monitoring
Learner Achievement (NASLA) have revealed glaring gaps that point to regional and
gender disparities in education, inadequate facilities, and low quality learning achievements,
among others. The Annual Learning Report, Are our Children Learning, (Uwezo, 2010)
revealed that 5 out of every 100 children aged between 6 to 16 years did not attend school
citing limited facilities and congested classroom as some of the reasons for lack of access
(Uwezo 2010). National Assessment Report (2010) revealed more challenges contained in
repetition at 59.8% (for the number of learners who had repeated one class in their cycle),
high absenteeism at 70.1% and low learning achievement at 47.7% (NASLA, 2010).
Despite the achievements of KESSP I, some investment programs did not achieve their
targets, largely due to a number of challenges affected the functioning of the country’s
education sector within the period under review. This has been largely due:

Poor Project Implementation: - lack of linking programme implementation to reporting
framework compounded by delays in flow of funds from development partners to the
Sector has affected the implementation of projects leading to some projects being left
uncompleted after the planned period and weak monitoring and evaluation of projects
leading, to poor or uncontrolled progress in implementation.

Management and Financial Issues (MFI):- the implementation of KESSP I has been
hampered by managerial and financial challenges, including weak co-ordination of
monitoring activities in the Sector leading to duplication; weak monitoring and evaluation
structures leading to poor tracking of field activities ; weak and uncoordinated information
systems which makes it difficult to generate output/outcome indicators necessary for
planning, and weaknesses in the implementation of Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS). Corruption and accountability concerns raising serious
questions of integrity have continued to dog the education sector in the last two years. This
hampers effectiveness and efficiency in resource targeting and utilization. Thus,
development partners have been withdrawing support. This poses a major threat to the
finalization of KESSP II framework and its final roll out.

Weak Monitoring & Evaluation structure: - despite the reported achievements of the
sector, it is regrettable that little efforts have been focused on measuring the extent to
which national goals of education are being achieved. Furthermore, the focus of our
education on national examinations has left gaps in learning outcomes. Thus, owing to
weak monitoring of programmes in the sector, their actual impact on the acquisition of the
desired skills among learners has often been left to mere speculation.

Participation and Inclusivity: - over the implementation period of KESSP I there have been
no formal way designed for the participation of civil society/citizenry in the programme.
This in effect makes monitoring the progress of the programme and ensuring social
accountability in education hard to effect. The current arrangement where most of the
stakeholders are not involved in monitoring the outcomes and financial performance of the



                                             81
government-led programmes provides room for fraud, corruption and at times outright
theft.

Quality and Relevance: - as a result of the shortage of teachers especially at primary level,
pupil teacher ratios have gone up particularly in urban slums and rural arid and semi-arid
lands thus impacting negatively on quality of education. In addition, shortage of Quality
Assurance and Standards officer’s has seriously undermined the critical role they are
supposed to play in ensuring effective curriculum delivery.

Reaching the un-reached children: - absence of and/or weak implementation structures of
the programmes targeting the hard- to- reach children and other marginalized groups has
seen the group receive inadequate funding. For example, the NFE sub sector lacks a broad
partnership framework encompassing community based NGOs, Faith Based Organizations
(FBOs), multi/bilateral agencies and key Ministries to enhance efforts to reach participation
for out-of-school children and youth, including deliberate expansion of FPE grants to non-
formal institutions.

Moving Forward

As the government and development partners continue to work on and finalize the strategy
for KESSP II for the period 2011-2015 which seeks to allocate further resources to the key
areas necessary to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Education for All
Goals (EFA), The following features stand out from the investment strategy.

   The new investment plan bases its financing on a joint or pooled funding mechanism
    that has been in place since 2005.
   The position of non state actors and NGOs has to be clearly defined. The CSOs have
    been able to use the limited project based funds received from external sources
    especially on promoting participatory governance and accountability in the sector and
    have important lessons to offer government in as far as reaching out to needy sections
    of the community is concerned.
   The governance and monitoring framework still doesn’t incorporate strong input from
    outside the Government such as CBOs yet empowerment of communities is the best
    surveillance that can guarantee full accountability at local levels.

It is suffice to say here, therefore, that support of civil society observations would improve
governance and strengthening of the education sector management. This in turn would
significantly enhance the impact of the aid component in the pooled funding mechanism.

                        Annex 11: Original Project Components

The project was structured around four main components and 23 investment subprograms
which are summarized below.

(I)     Ensure equity of access to basic education (US$154.0 million). The desired key
outcome of this component was to reduce disparities in education opportunity due to
wealth, geographical location and gender, by creating an opportunity for all children
(including those of the poorest families and those living in remote areas) to attend a school
of acceptable quality. This was to be achieved through 5 investment subprograms,
targeting specific beneficiaries:

(i)     Primary school infrastructure subprogram (US$88.0 million). The subprogram
        objective was to improve access. This was to be achieved by: (a) rehabilitating
        dilapidated schools and construction of additional facilities in existing schools in
        poorest areas; and (b) constructing new primary schools in areas where there was
        overcrowding in existing schools and/or where there were no primary schools based
        on priority needs across the country. Identification of location was to be based on a
        comprehensive analysis of the 2004 school mapping data (overcrowding, greatest
        demand, longest distance), and other interim intervention criteria as applicable.

(ii)    Non-formal schools (US$26. million). The subprogram objective was to strengthen
        the capacity of non-formal schools. This was to be achieved by: (a) developing a
        curriculum on non-formal education; (b) providing grants for instructional materials
        to Non-formal Schools (NFSs) and Non-formal Education Centers (NFECs), and
        rehabilitation or construction of infrastructure; (c) introducing non-formal education
        management information systems; (d) building management capacity; and (e)
        mainstreaming and coordinating non-formal schools and centers.

(iii)   Special needs education (US$20.0 million). The subprogram objective was to
        improve special needs education. This was to be achieved by: (a) conducting a
        national survey on special needs education; (b) providing equipment and the
        relevant instructional materials; (c) training teachers; (d) providing grants for
        special needs education; (e) promoting advocacy and awareness creation; and (f)
        financing operating costs.

(iv)    Adult basic education (US$17.0 million). The subprogram objective was to
        improve the quality of basic education. This was to be achieved by: (a) establishing
        a program on quality assurance and accreditation; (b) establishing a program on
        partnership for collaborative program support; and (c) establishing a program for
        monitoring and evaluation of the subprogram.

(v)     Expanding basic education opportunities in Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASALs)
        (US$2.0 million). The subprogram objective was to improve educational
        opportunities. This was to be achieved by establishing mobile schools.

                                             86
(vi)    Gender and education investment program (US$1.0 million). The subprogram
        objective was to ensure that gender aspects received attention through the KESSP
        implementation. This was to be achieved by: (a) preparing a Gender and Education
        Policy; (b) increasing enrolment and retention of girls in schools (and boys where
        applicable), girls’ participation and performance in education; and (c) water and
        environmental sanitation in schools.

(II)    Enhance quality and learning achievement (US$735.0 million). The desired key
outcome of this component was to ensure that a set of essential inputs was available to
every child, that these inputs were effectively utilized, that learning was the central focus of
what was happening in the classroom, that learning progress was regularly measured, and
that the quality of schooling was effectively monitored and supported. Also included in the
component were subprograms on teacher development and communication technology in
education. These were to be achieved through 8 investment subprograms, targeting
specific beneficiaries:

(i)     Early childhood and development (ECD) (US$32.0 million). The subprogram
        objective was to enhance the quality of ECD. This was to be achieved by: (a)
        developing national policy guidelines and service standards on early childhood
        development; (b) reviewing and updating the curriculum on ECD; (c) mobilizing
        and building the capacity of communities on ECD through awareness creation; and
        (d) providing community support grants to promote early childhood access, health,
        nutrition, and primary school readiness.

(ii)    School health, nutrition and meals (US$121.0 million). The subprogram objective
        was to enhance the school meals program. This was to be achieved by: (a)
        promoting health, education and parasite prevention; (b) building capacity on
        school health and meals program; and (c) monitoring the school health and meals
        program.

(iii)   Primary school instructional materials (US$475.0 million). The subprogram
        objective was to provide all public primary schools and non-formal schools with
        instructional materials in order to increase access and address quality. This was to
        be achieved through the logical development of a continuous and well tested set of
        reforms in textbook financing through a basic decentralized instructional materials
        system on which the IDA FPESP procurement system was based, and one which
        was pioneered by a pilot project supported by the Dutch Government which was
        launched in Laikipia and Machakos Districts in 1996. From 1999 until 2006 the
        pilot project initiatives were further developed by the Government/ DFID SPRED 3
        project, which extended the same basic principles to every district in Kenya. These
        were successful, established programs for the provision of textbooks and other
        materials at primary level through the school level SIMBA account. There was
        evidence from various studies that there were positive impacts of the textbooks and
        teacher guides on teaching and learning. They included improvements in student
        retention and attendance, students’ appreciation of the new books leading to their
        improved performance in school, and easing the teaching challenge for teachers

                                              87
         who were able to convey skills and knowledge more quickly, and enabling them to
         give homework assignments. The continuation of the established program through
         the KESSP was to be achieved by: (a) providing instructional materials; (b)
         providing funds for general purposes; (c) reprinting instructional materials; and (d)
         providing stationery and equipment.

(iv)     In-service Primary Teacher Education (INSET) (US$37.0 million).           The
         subprogram objective was to extend the INSET program. This was to be achieved
         by: (a) extending the successful School-based Teacher Development Program
         (SbTD) which was one component of the MOEST Strengthening Primary
         Education (SPRED 2) Project II, support by DFID, to include the training of an
         additional 36,000 Key Resource Teachers (18,500 Kiswahili KRTs and 18,500
         Guidance and Counseling teachers—one in every school in the country).; and (b)
         continuing the second national program of school-based development called the
         School Empowerment Program (SEP).

(v)      Pre-service teacher education (US$18.0 million). The subprogram objective was to
         strengthen primary teacher training. This was to be achieved by: (a) establishing a
         Local Resource Center and equipping it with the relevant materials and equipment;
         (b) providing funds in the form of bursaries to needy students; (c) providing
         transport to primary teacher training colleges; and (d) monitoring of pre-service
         teacher program.

(vi)     Quality assurance and standards (US$27.0 million). The subprogram objective
         was to ensure a quality of education with standards. This was to be achieved by: (a)
         establishing a national assessment system; (b) harmonizing training in learning
         achievement studies; (c) setting up an examination item banking system; and (d)
         monitoring student achievement. These were to be undertaken by the KNEC. The
         KIE was to: (a) undertake curriculum review and material for non-science students,
         adult basic education for the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and
         Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) equivalent; (b) ensure
         curriculum support material production and induction of teachers; and (c) explore
         alternative teaching/learning approaches.

(vii)    In-service training for secondary teachers to upgrade mathematics and science
         instruction (US$20.0 million). The subprogram objective was to promote stronger
         mathematics and science instruction. This was to be achieved by providing INSET
         to upgrade mathematics and science teaching.

(viii)   Information and communication technology in education (US$5.0 million). The
         subprogram objective was to promote information and communication technology
         in the classroom. This was to be achieved by: (a) preparing an ICT policy and
