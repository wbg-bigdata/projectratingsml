Implementing Agency:       Ministry of Finance (Public Credit)
Description:               The proposed SECAL, a one tranche loan intended to be completed before
the end of the current Administration on August 7, 2002, is the Bank's
response to the current govemment's demonstrated commitment to social
sector reforms. The loan would: (i) encourage and enable the current
Administration's momentum on several key social reforms that have been
developed with active Bank support; (ii) provide an opportunity to influence
the social sector agenda of the next Administration; and (iii) help sustain the
Government's fiscal program during this calendar year.
The operation supports the medium term strategic framework laid out in
Table 4.1 and includes among others the following core set of legally
binding actions: (i) the introduction of a system of periodic
impact/performance evaluation and public monitoring of the Government of
Colombia's (GOC) main social sector programs to improve their
transparency and citizens' oversight; (ii) the development of a
comprehensive Social Risk Management System, improvements in ICBF
child assistance nrograms, and formulation of a time-bound action plan to
eliminate barriers to internally displaced population's access to social
programs; (iii) the expansion of the subsidi7ed health insuranre coverage of
the poor, issuance of regulations to implement the new methodology for
a!cting tllhealthlk an 0 to t.rletro".gthanlnr of theJA   H!Lth

of 1ne iUimuizatuon program; () greeLrI twuri w UbLeI c'Uu' care
programs through incombe-based cost recovery and efficiencies from the
decentralization of iCBF programs; and (iii) improved educational status of
children through increased efficiency and equity in the allocation of
resources.
The timing of the loan is an issue posing some risks. Given the upcoming
change of government, questions have been raised about the wisdom of
presenting the Board with a one-tranche loan to be disbursed by the end of
the current Administration's term. The principal concern has been that the
new Administration might fail to support or might even reverse the various
reform initiatives embodied in the SECAL. This risk factor has been
weighed against the benefits of approving the proposed loan under the
current Administration. The conclusion is that the expected benefits
outweigh the risk for reasons elaborated in Section 4B. Two reasons are
noteworthy in this regard. First, various programs supported by the
operation (e.g. the expansion of the number of poor people affiliated with
the subsidized health insurance regime) are now under implementation and
are already providing substantial benefits to their target population. These
benefits are unlikely to be reversed. Second. the social strengthening
program supported by this loan has strong backing from a wide spectrum of
qtnkAehnIders incliIding the incoming Administration which haq indicateA itq
agreement to the presentation of the proposed loan to the Board before the

INTRODUCTION
i.     I submit tor your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed Social Sector
Adjustment Loan (SECAL) to the Republic of Colombia for US$ 155 million in support of the
government's social sector development program. The loan will be fixed spread in US Dollars with 15
years maturity including 5 years of grace with a Libor-based variable interest rate
ii.    The proposed SECAL is a one tranche loan to be conpletwed before the end nf the nr1rrt-nt
Administration on August 7, 2002. The loan would: (i) support key social reforms that the current
atministrntion has deAvelped uvith actiuve Ba4- support; (ii) n-AAd an ^"",rhm,l.rty . inf.  the- ArcA
sector agenda of the next Administration; and (iii) help sustain the Government's fiscal program during
this caler,a..r year
iii.   TLhi SEC      1IIIIJUWAL   LU LkIm to LI1r a %.uuuC y abbibLanutw strgya wei :l asI Uue   s sIhUIL
term financial needs and social goals. The proposed SECAL supports the GOC's strong commitment to
soun,d fiscal mnanagement and hel,ps provide a financial cushion, t^he need for wnich has become even
more pressing as a result of recent developments: the breakdown of the peace process, weak economic
growth, and unfavorable financial markets - factors that have combined to increase UGO's financiai
needs and raise the price of borrowing from private financial markets. The proposed SECAL also ensures
fiscal space for social protection to enhance the sustainability of the fiscal reforms supported by tie
recently-approved Bank-supported Structural Fiscal Adjustment Loan (SFAL), a need underscored by the
Board in recent discussions on the SFAL. On the social front, the SECAL supports the GOC's ongoing
efforts to establish enabling regulations for the implementation of the health and education reforms
mandated by the recently approved Law 715. In this regard, the CAS Update recently discussed with the
Board confirmed the strategic importance of this SECAL.
iv.    The proposed SECAL represents the culmination of the Bank's program of social sector
strengthening activities initiated with the GOC three years ago. This program consists primarily of three
lending operations and two sector studies aimed at improving social protection, human capital
development and poverty reduction. Of the three lending operations planned in 1998 for Bank and 1DB
financing, two investment loans - the Community Works and Employment Project and Human Capital
Protection Project that are part of the Red de Apoyo Social (RAS) emergency safety net program -- are
currently under implementation; the third one, intended as an adiustment operation from the start, is the
current proposal.! The analytical work consists of the recently completed Colombia Social Safety Net
A.sse.ssment and the Colombia Povertv Renort. These studies have not only informed this nronosed
operation, but have also stimulated discussions of social sector reform issues within and outside
a vernm,i-nt rirnles (see Annex- P on cions1ltRtions)
rhese lending operations are complemented by other human capital investment projects, notably the Youth Development LIL,
Rural Education, and Decentralization Education Management Projects, which support institutional strengthening and
e        ..r.enttation wvith mn. ative a,p.o-achhes. for de-a.;ng -A.th issues of violence &-A the education of poor children, ir.clS,i_
children in isolated areas.
J



v.     While the SECAL marks the completion of the above-mentioned package of social sector
strengthening activities, it also acts as a bridge to the future. The medium-term policy firamework
supported by this loan identifies follow up activities for the incoming Administration that the Bank deems
important for the coming years. These activities are summarized in the Policy Matrix (Table 4.1) and the
Letter of Development Policy (Annex D). They are further elaborated in Annex E, which lays out the
Bank's Colombia Social Sector Strategy for the medium-term. Dialogues with various stakeholders,
including the technical teams of leading presidential candidates, indicate strong and broad political
support for the operation and its medium-term policy framework.
vi.    Undertaking this loan in the face of an upcoming change of Administration clearly entails
considerable risks. The main concem is the sustainabilitv of the measures supported by the operation, due
to the timing of the loan. Various measures have been taken to address those risks, including confirming
broad-based supnort for the measures backed by the loan (see Section 4) and obtaining agreement from
the incoming Administration. On balance, signaling the value of sustained cooperation and of continued
focusl on the social sot.tnr reform issues being addressed by the adusLstment loan outweigh- the risks of
approving the proposed loan.
vii.   This operation, like the loans supporting the Red de Apoyo Social (RAS) safety net program and
the recent analyrtical work, is the product of sustaited collabornadon among the GOC, the Bank and the
IDB. In fact, the proposed SECAL and IDB's Social Sector Project are financing in parallel the GOC's
social setor auJuILLL.nt prograwr..

A.     Poverty, Economic Setback and Conflict
1. Achievements In growth and poverty reduction. Colombia has benefited from stable growth and
low economic volatility. Steady GDP per capita growth averaging 1.8% annually between 1978-1995
brought significant improvements in overall poverty rates (Table 1.1), although growing inequality
affected the distribution of the benefits.2

2. In tue last 70 years, the country experienced only one economic downturn. A recent cross-country
study has shown that the probability of the Colombian economy entering episodes of "high volatility" in
the last 30 years was close to zero.3 Steady economic growth afiorded Colombia poverty reduction as
well as marked improvements in health and education (see Section 2 below).
3. At the heart of this remarkable performance was Colombia's prudent economic management that
allowed it to steadily accumulate and mobilize human and physical capital, resulting in high productivity
and employment. Colombia's simultaneous support of employment and GDP growth was crucial to
poverty reduction.4
2The tight connection between GDP growth and poverty in Colombia is documented in Annex C of the SFAL.
3Rodrikt D. "Why is there so much Economic Insecurity in Latin AmericaT' World Bank mnimen. October 1999.
4 The critical relationship between growth, unemployment and poverty is indicated by the enormous effect of household head's
unemployment on poverty. In urban areas poverty is 25 percentage points higher if the head used to work and is presently
unemployed (the nexus between poverty and employment/income growth is discussed in Annex D of World Bank SFAL, 2001).

discussed below thai resuited in the deterioration of key social indicators. Tne downturn in economic
growth, the high unemployment rate, and the continued widening of income inequality combined to
dramatically reverse the reduction in poverty achieved over the past two decades, as shown in Tabie 1. 1.
Between 1995 and 1999, poverty rates rose four percentage points and extreme poverty rates rose by two
percentage points. This reversal is disappointing, considering that even at its lowest in the mid-nineties
60% of the population remained poor. The severity of poverty increased as well, particularly in urban
areas, where the poverty gap rose from 19% to 26% from 1995 to 1999.5
5. The recent crisis did not leave rural areas unaffected. Even though the rural poverty headcount
measure remained relatively stable, this masks the deterioration in the depth of poverty as marked by the
increase in the poverty gap from 40% to 44% between 1995 and 1999.
6. A closer look at the impact of the economic downturn, using results of a 1999 survey, when the
economic recession was strongest, indicates that while 37% of the households in the sample registered a
negative income shock, 54% modified their consumption habits in varying degrees, depending on their
savings/wealth and access to credit.6 It was found also that poor households are more vulnerable. in that
they are more likely to be affected by negative income or consumption shocks (Figure 1.1).

One reason is that poorer households are less likely to have access to savings and credit, as indicated by
the 'income + other' line denoting the probability of an income shock by poverty quintile for. households
with access to savings and/or credit.
7. As illustrated in Figure 1.1, the probability of a reduction in consumption is approximately 20
percentage points higher for the four lowest quintiles as compared to the wealthiest quintile. The same
survey further found that the probability of a household member dropping out of school is 8 percentage
points higher in those households that reported a negative income shock that in those that did not. This
result underscores one of the negative human development impacts of the recent economic setbacks.
Section 2 further discusses how the weakening of the economy has affected the education. health care,
and nutrition status of the population.

inefficiency in the delivery of social services. The financial imbalance, on the other hand, was caused by
weaknesses in the banking sector.
lO. With those critical structural weaknesses in tne government accounts and the financial sector, the
country was vulnerable to the 1998-1999 economic recession triggered by a combination of a sharp
deterioration in the country;s terms of trade, the effect of the East Asia and Russia crises, and a
weakening of private investor confidence due to stepped-up violence and internal conflict.
11. Increasing violence and transaction costs. Complicating the investment climate and poverty
reduction effort is the intensification of the internal conflict. This governance problem has contributed to
the deterioration of the investment climate and to the disruption of the lives of many families. It has also
made delivery of social and development assistance difficult and dangerous to the above-mentioned areas,
calling for the implementation of creative solutions for reaching the civilian population in affected areas.
12. The increase in violence, deaths, kidnappings, extortion and displacement due to the rise of the
guerrillas' and paramilitaries' economic and military strength has carried a heavy toll, especially among
the rural civilian population. There is no reliable figure on the number of displaced population. The G(OC
estimates that there are currently 400,000 displaced people. Other estimates put it at a much higher level.
This nonulation has been evicted from areas where they have been engaged in productive economic
activities and relocated in urban slums where economic prospects are limited.

changes introduced in the 1991 Constitution. One key change involved an emphasis on decentralization,
with territorial transfers to finance decentralization dependent on the government's current fiscal revenues
which were volatile during the 1990's due to fluctuations in economic activity. An asymmetry between
increases and decreases in expenditures resulted, and revenue transfers below anticipated trends were not
sufficient to cover the asymmetry, creating additional financial obligations for the central government.
Other important changes introduced by the 1991 Constitution involved reforms in social secunty and a
7



renewed emphasis on the role of the state in the provision of social services, justice, and security. The
fiscal implications of the new rules were large. Transfers from the central to local governments nearly
doubled from 22% of current revenues in 1990 to over 42% in 2001, social security expenditures at the
central level grew from 2.9% to 5.3% of GDP between 1990 and 1997, and defense spending increased
from 1.4% to 3% of GDP over the same period.

14. The emnhasis on decentralization was not. however. comnensated by a reduction in the size of the
central government. Central government expenditures, other than transfers to local governments and to
social secnlritv- continued to rise during the 1 QOs, Trowinro by 50%,/- from 4=20/ to 6.3% of GDP dirinn
the decade. This pressure led to continuous attempts to raise revenues through no fewer than eight tax

increased by 1.9 percentage points, expenditures did so by 3.3 percentage points during the decade. From
a si.tution of a nearly balanced budget in the ea-ly !990s, Coloma.bia thus en,ded 1 999 ,,,h a Nor
Financial Public Sector (NFPS) deficit of 6.3% of GDP (Table 1.2).
15. In addition, a rapid real appreciation of the peso through the early and mid-1990s, partly as a result of
large capital inlow  due to new oil discovVries, Uireased borr-owing from abroad as a resut VI 'ifz
country's new investment-grade rating, and the repatriation of foreign exchange undermined trade
liberalization efforts. Capital infiows pusheu up asset prices, particularly real estate. A strong peso was
supported by a newly independent Central Bank with a Constitutional mandate to control inflation. The
appreciating currency was particularly detrimental to the agriculturai sector and to textile manufactures.
In addition, while capital and imports were relatively cheap, labor became increasingly costly. The
combination of these factors led to growing fiscal and external deficits, pushing Colombia first toward
slower growth and rising unemployment from 1996 onward, and later into a full-blown recession.
16. The current account deficit had reached worrisome levels by 1997-98, standing at above 5% of GDP.
The deterioration in the current account began in 1993 as a result of rapid growth in private investment
and borrowing spurred by a boom in the real estate sector. By 1997, however, the external deficit
reflected the imbalance in the fiscal accounts, spurred by growing public expenditures and rising interest
payments. In addition, export revenues fell in 1997 and 1998 as a result of the drop in oil and coffee
prices, Colombia's two largest exports, further aggravating the problem.
17. Colombia's deteriorating fundamentals, combined with a trade shock estimated at 1.5% of GDP, and
with events in international credit markets. resulted in the virtual closing of financial markets to the
country. This forced the Colombian authorities to turn to the domestic market to fulfill their large
finncing needs, putting increasing pressuire on donmestir interest r2tes* Tnterest rates were driven even
higher by continued attacks on the peso in 1998 and 1999, confirming market concerns regarding the
OsL staii o      m     a'fal and '  iJtornl imbalances. The failed attens bthu Arnt.a! no-S to
defend the existing exchange rate band led to a cumulative loss of US$1.8 billion in reserves. The

26% in late 1998. The exchange rate band was finally abandoned in September 1999 and the peso was
allWoe to float freely.7

contractions were construction (-20%), manufacturing (-15%), and commerce and financial services (each
-7%). With thAe severe recession haT hit thAe country, however, imports piummeted as domestic demand
collapsed, while exports benefited from the high international price of oil and the devaluation of the peso.
Tne current account in 1999 and 2000 was therefore in near balance. Tne condition of the financial
system, already under strain, worsened during 1998 and 1999 due to the sharp deterioration of loan
portfolios and a large volume of nonproductive assets. High interest rates and negative economic growth
stretched the payment capacity of most borrowers, and arrears in the loan portfolios grew to almost 15%
in 1999. To head off a systemic crisis in the financial system, the government put in place programs to
assist financial institutions and mortgage holders. Measures were also put in place to recapitalize viable
private banks and to address the problems of public banks.8
19. Economic woes have been accompanied by high unemployment levels of about 19%, which have not
reacted significantly to the moderate resumption of growth over the past two years. Shrinking demand
has also been partially responsible for the drop in inflation from nearly 18% in 1997 to under 8% in 2001.
20. Macroeconomic adjustment. In response to the severity of the recession, the Colombian government
embarked on a program of stabilization, supported by a three-year (2000-02) Extended Fund Facility
from the IMF and the recently-negotiated Bank-financed SFAL. The government program aims to
increase revenues and reduce expenditures; this is to be complemented by a rationalization and definition
of the roles and competencies of central and local government.
21. A number of measures, mainly directed to enhancing revenues, have been taken. These include (i)
pasagop of Qtrirt hiutipte sincep 2000 (ii) uAaiprninc of the uavlip AeAMleA taav hbasp (iii imnrnv4ina tax

central and local levels was also enacted. A number of other important reforms are currently under
consideration by Congress, includin2 the vital pension reform, a fiscai responsibility law, and a territorial
tax reform.
7 The peso has depreciated by about 15% in inomninal terms since the collapse of the band, and the behavior of the exchange
market has remained largely orderly.
8 The government estimates the cost of cleaning up the balance sheets of private banks at about 4.5% of GDP, nearly half of
which would come out of public coffers through FOGAFIN loans, with an additional 4% of GDP for the restucturing of public
banks.

intensified following the attacks of September 1l '. On the domestic front, internal demand growth
reinedI~m  sluggish. The.-e was litf' si1.UL reactiva.ion il  coUL onIUUUUU aiid real es'wte sectors, as
credit supply and demand stalled. The private sector elected to pay off its debts and continued to be
cauLiowu a  L UOl1UW1Ul sigificaity for acceieraug i-vestments. The fnanciai system, aithiough
stronger as a whole, suffers from continued fragility in its mortgage banking sector. The oil sector,
Colombia's main export earner, saw earnings deciine as a result of the aging of oii fieids and guerrilia
attacks on pipelines, combined with lower international prices. Unemployment remained high, at about
i9 percent, and in response, much of the government' s investment program focused on strengthening the
social safety net, targeted to mitigate the negative impact of the economic contraction on the poor.
23. Colombia in 2001 again met the public sector deficit targets set out in its program with the IMF. The
targets were modified to take into account the impact of lower-than-expected economic growth on
government revenues. The NFPS fiscal deficit stood at 3.8% of GDP, while the consolidated public
deficit was lower, at 3.3% of GDP, due in large part to the central bank's cash profits. The current
account deficit widened by more than 2% of GDP in 2001 as traditional exports, particularly oil and
coffee, weakened sharply both in volume and price, while growing domestic demand sustained imports.
The growth of nontraditional exports to neighboring Andean countries, despite flagging demand in the
United States, helped to moderate the expansion of the current account deficit. The capital account
strengthened in 2001 as a result of further public sector borrowing and reduced net capital outflows from
the private sector. International reserves remained at about six to seven months of imports in the coming
years, with small yearly increases resulting largely from interest earnings on the reserves.
24. To finance its deficit, the government has relied on both external and domestic credit. Public smertor
external debt at the end of 2001 stood at about 28.5% of GDP, up from 24% and 26% in 1999 and 2000,
reqnectively; total net public debt was about 46% of GDP. On the mnnet-rv freont the rpie arm,th in
currency since 1999 subsided in 2001 in response to the recovery of the financial sector and the
exemp.tion from the financial transaction tox grnted on deposits in mortgage banks. Fin&ncial system
credit to the private sector languished, however, during the year, and the economic recovery continued to

25. Economic Prospects. GDP growth of about 2% is projected for 2002. Prospects for an acceleration
of growth are hamripered by weak domesuc demana, nigh unemployment, and low rates of private
investment. As mentioned above, lower-than-projected growth has meant an easing of fiscal targets under
Colombia's program with the iME as revenues have declined, and it is likely that targets would be eased
again in 2002 should growth performance be weaker than the 2.5-3% projected by the Fund. The recent
collapse of peace negotiations with the FARC, the country's largest guerrilla group, and the return to open
hostilities compounds the down-side, particularly in terms of the fiscal outcome and the investment
climate.
26. The external environment, namely declines in both the price and total production of oil, combined
with low coffee prices, will also have an impact. In this regard, the government intends to continue its
flexible exchange rate policy to encourage nontraditional exports and foreign direct investment.
Developments in the US economy, Colombia's main trading partner and the largest importer of
10

export market. Another risk in the external macroeconomic environment involves possible increased

reforms would make this fiscal stabilization possible despite expected declines in oil production over the
next five years. 'under this scenario, Colombia's total pUblic debt would stabilize at about 50% of GDP
in the long term.
28. As stated, maintaining sustainable deficits into the future requires the passage of structural reforms
outlined above that are designed to improve control over public sector expenditures. The government has
remained committed to its adjustment and reform program despite difficult domestic conditions. The
significant reduction of the fiscal deficit since the onset of the recession and the passage of the bulk of its
program of structural reforms are evidence of this. Nevertheless, a few important reforms, such as the
pension reform, fiscal responsibility law and territorial tax reform, have yet to be approved by Congress.
While these reforms are crucial for medium- and long-term fiscal sustainability, it should be noted that
their short-run fiscal impacts are modest. The administration has also worked hard to build consensus and
support for its reform package and for the fiscal adjustment efforts which will need to be continued by the
newly-elected government.

as the Central Bank moves toward inflation targeting in conducting its monetary policy. While some
inflaiionary pressures can be expected as tne econoimc recovery proceeds, continued migh levels of
unemployment, slackness in external and domestic demand, and productivity gains should enable the
attainment of infiation targets.
31. A higher national savings rate and a sustainable current account deficit would create the required
space for expansion in private investment that is critical to achieving an economic growth of 3.5% or
above. Both private and public investment dropped significantly during the 1998-99 recession, and have
not rebounded to levels sufficient for sustaining long-term growth at the 3.5% level envisioned-total
investment in Colombia stands at about 16% of GDP. Central government investment has been reduced
to about just over 1% of GDP, half its average level during 1990-97, and represents about one third of the
resources currently spent on interest payments on central government debt. Private investment has
undergone a decline since 1994, and now stands at only about 8% of GDP.
32. The key ingredient for improving Colombia's investment climate is achieving a reduction in both
political and economic uncertainty. On the political front, the breakdown of peace negotiations has
delayed a rebound in investment. While realizing Colombia's full growth potential could not haDpen
under conditions of conflict, much can nevertheless be done on the economic front to improve the
investment climate in the countrv. Bringing the fiscal accounts onto a sustainable path is therefore
important, and would help to significantly reduce the country risk associated with Colombia. The
reduction of the deficit and. therefore. of the need to tan domestic markets to finance the deficit; would
not only open needed space for the private sector, but would also enhance the credibility of the
stPbili7tion pronmm and the prospects for the fiuture. Fiscal qtahi1ization would also create the rpacne for
public sector investment in areas complementary to private sector activity, effectively "crowding in"

2. THE SOCIAL SECTOR: PERFORMANCE AND CHALLENGES
33. Colombia's social programs have largely addressed the welfare of its citizens through the provision of
education. health. social safety net emnlovment. training and labor nrotection. Todavy these nrograis are
central to the GOC's social sector strengthening program that aims to protect and accumulate human
canital in the face of increLased volatility and tiQht blidgetarv constraints.

35. Following a period of aiLmost complete stagnation tmrougn the i970s and 1980s, puDiic expenditure in
Colombia began to grow dramatically firom 1990 onwards. Between 1990 and 1997, overall public
expenditures rose from 1 i% of GDP to i8.9% and had almost doubied by 2001, reaching 20.1% of GDP.
This increase was driven primarily by spending in the social sectors, notably in health, education, and
pensions resulting from the dramatic social reforms of the 1990's promulgated by the 1991 Constitution,
Law 60 and Law 100 (see Figure 2.1, which presents the 1990-2000 trends in social spending relative to
GDP by category of expenditure).
36. Three aspects of this growth in social sector spending are relevant to this discussion. First, total social
spending (defined as health, education, pensions, and other social spending) increased sharply from 1 993-
1996, led by increases in health and education, and steady growth in pensions. The government budget for
health and education rose from approximately 4% of GDP in the early 1990's to over 8% of GDP by
1996. Second, the rapid growth in social public spending was unsustainable, as evidenced by the fiscal
imbalances accumulated in the closing years of the twentieth century as the economy went into recession.
Third, spending for social assistance remained low and pro-cyclical even with onset of the crisis in 1998.
Social assistance was not included in the social sector reforms of the 1990's that resulted in institutional
reform, increased spending and decentralization. In contrast to the trends observed in other social sectors,
central government budgeted exoenditures on social assistance fluctuated around 1% of GDP during the
first part of the 1990's and fell to less than 0.7% by 2000.9
37. Today Colombia is faced with the dual challenge of restoring a fiscal balance and protecting the gains

9Social assistance is defined as spending on the four main social assistance programs reported in agareaated budgetary data - the
ICBF family welfare institute, the RSS social fund, the INURBE housing institute and utilities subsidies.
10 There is no fixed definition of what should be included as social sector programs. Consequently, estimates of social sector
expenditures vary substantialy. In Colombia, whore it is legaUy stipulated that a minimum amount should be allocated for social
programs, the official definition of social expenditures is quite broad (and has been changing) to comply with the legal mandate.

B. Subsectoral issues
(1) Social Safety Net
38. Colombia's historical reliance on economic growth as a social safety net is no longer available as an
option. Today, Colombia must craft a functional social safety net to minimize social welfare losses from
uncertainty and to facilitate economic adjustments. The GOC appreciates this point and recognizes the
need to be better prepared to face future crises. The recent experience with designing and launching the
Red de Apoyo Social (RAS) program held a valuable lesson: in times of crisis lack of preparedness
imposes considerable costs in terms of the efficiency and timeliness of social assistance. Consequently,
one of the GOC's priorities has been to develop an effective countercyclical social assistance system
before the next economic crisis hit the countrv.

40. Key Vulnerable Groups. A recent Bank study, the Colombia Social Safety Net Assessment lays out
the vuinerabie population groups and their needs and matches them witn existing sociai assistance
programs. The study highlights the following conclusions:



(a) Children and adolescents are the main age-specific vulnerable groups in Colombia today
requiring attention from a reformed safety net. Pre-school and primary school age children face
important health and nutrition risks. In rural areas, this age group is at risk of malnutrition as
over 85% are poor. Some health indicators are also preoccupying, particularly the decrease in
vaccination rates, increase in prevalence of some diseases like diarrhea among children, and
increase in the percentage of children receiving no medical treatment. In both rural and urban
areas youth age 12-17 have been identified as exceptionally vulnerable due to their exposure to
multiple aspects of violence and crime. This age group is at risk of dropping out of school,
joining gangs or paramilitary groups, and engaging in prostitution or the narcotics trade. The
probability of children dropping out of school among the poorest households in the four rnaior
cities increases significantly when households suffer an income shock (Gaviria 2000).
(b) The elderly are particularly exposed to risks because they do not receive any substantial source
of nrotection from the current safety net. Pension coverage reaches 18% of the elderly, and only
2% in the poorest quintile.
(c) The internally displaced people, a result of Colombia's internal conflict, constitute another
rritirnllv vuinornahlo orn1nn The CTOC. eqtirnateq that there are ciurrentlv 400n)00 disnlced ne,nle
while other estimates put the number of displaced at close to 2 million." This population has been
evicted from areas where they haov b-A n pingang in pnrhdiitivp ennonmin  hvtiPiQe _nIA rplo^atpij
in urban slums where employment prospects are limited, access to social services constrained and
-iolence and crime are r,pant. A-ailable dAta su,ggest that many of the displaced are womrren
(50%) and children (48% under 18) with limited skills and education. Despite the development of
a  IIG    K  1.119 WIV1  1   1 _  A /jVu  1_  ._LI__  _ _V  1   _J D 1 V  ^lk  I  1A  I aV71.1  .d1U11 TV_   L_1._
IDP has been complicated by (i) resources remaining insufficient for financing the national
strLegy; andU (ii) a pIogXUIUu1cUL approacU hUuu 1 that mi15 nabrbmes au1uurU a ivgisuy listg
people as displaced, an identification process that has been both lengthy and difficult to manage
given the stigma and risk of being identified as an LD-P.
(d) Unemployment is critical to vulnerability. in the recent crisis, households experiencing the
largest increases in poverty were those with only self-employed workers or only non-labor
income. A higher employment rate within households remains the singie best protection against
poverty (Poverty Assessment, 2001).
41. The social safety net study also shows the need for institutional improvements in the following areas:
(a) Establishing a Social Risk Management System. Although Colombia made important advances
with the introduction of the Red de Apoyo Social (RAS) safety net programs, these programs
remain temporary in nature and a broader vision for Colombia's social safety net has yet to be
articulated. Although individual programs are in place, Colombia needs to define the scope and
function of the social safety net during crisis and non-crisis times. This articulation should
involve a review of not only the new and existing social assistance programs, but also the social
insurance programs in health and pensions targeted to the poor that play a key role in Colombia's
social safety net. Looking ahead, the Government of Colombia needs to prepare itself to exploit
the opportunity for further reform of the Social Risk Management System at the end of 2004

on different sources of information and divergent methodologies for estimating the size and characteristics of the IDP.
12 The institutional framework includes Law 387 launched in 1997, followed by the "Plan of Action for the Prevention and
Attention of Forced Displacement" (CONPES 3057) implemented in November 1999. The latter plan redefined mechanisms and
instruments for the prevention of displacement, the protection of the IDP and emergency humanitarian attention. It also
established actions for their social and economic stabilization.



when external financingz for the RAS Drograms concludes and the impact evaluation results of
these programs will be available. Ideally, other impact evaluations of key social programs that
comnose or could be directed toward the social safetv net would be available at this time to serve
as an input to a more systemic reform of the safety net.
(b) Increasing Social Assistance Spending. Social assistance funding is not only relatively low but
alsn nro-r.ylical. RnSending nn thnot noramnq connetitu-t appnrnyimnately 0. O/% nf rGDP (nnt
including the new, temporary Red de Apoyo Social programs). This percentage appears low when

vulnerable groups that lack access to key social assistance programs. With respect to funding pro-
cycIlicality, a recentL OLUUy reVea0 Ls that for eacU pUes  oV reuceU GlDP, solcil milma0lnv fell by 7
pesos, making social assistance the most pro-cyclical component of social sector spending.14 This
overall pattern is evident in tie recent economic crisis which resulited in reduced spending on
social assistance programs, with earmarked programs such as ICBF suffering less dramatic
reductions than those financed from generai revenues inciuding the RSS programs for the
indigent elderly and internally displaced people.
(c) Improving Poverty Targeting. Existing social assistance programs are available primarily to
formal sector workers. T-here is little use of Colombia's well-know SiSBLEN proxy means test
outside of the health insurance system. Improvements in targeting could be achieved through
expenditure re-allocation toward targeted safety net programs combined with the expanded use of
SISBEN or other appropriate poverty-targeting schemes. Despite advances in improving the
targeting of social expenditures and ongoing reforms to the SISBEN proxy means testing system,
problems remain concerning heterogeneous coverage of SISBEN, manipulation of the instrument,
lack of effective social control mechanisms, and limited monitoring and quality control.15
(2) The Health Sgstem
42. Before 1993 the Colombian health care system exnerienced four tvnes of nroblems: (i) low levels of
insurance coverage and access to services, (ii) inequity in the distribution of public subsidies, (iii) low
nualitv of services in the governmental facilities and (iv) inefficiency in the use of public resonrces for
health. Law 100 of 1993 radically reformed the health system of Colombia. The health reform created a

UruguaY and 1% in Venezuela.

elderly, children and handicapped.
' Several of these issues are cwuTently being addressed and are supported by the 1DB Social Sector Adjustment Loan (see Annex
H).

43. The bizzest success of the health reform has been the increase health insurance coverage from 24% to
57% of the population between 1993 and 1997. Rural areas experienced a much higher increase in
coverage from 7% in 1993 to 48% in 1997. Furthermore, increases in coverage concentrated in the lower
income deciles, with insurance coverage in the first decile rising tenfold from around 4% in 1993 to 40%

whose health spending and GDP per capita were lower than Colombia's. To improve its performance,
Colombia needs to coLmplete iLUnplementation of ilS healh systein reform and lo remedy a range of
weaknesses affecting the system's effectiveness, efficiency and stability.
45. The ISS-Health Problems. In the context of overall health system reform, Law 100 also gave the ISS
(Institituto del Seguro Social) the legal form of a public industrial and commercial company. As such, it
could manage retirement pensions, workers' compensation, health insurance (ISS-EPS), and health
service delivery (ISS-il'). In health, ISS-EPS and ISS-IPS businesses are in practice a simple fimancing
operation, which remains inefficient and unable to compete with the private sector.
46. The Public Hospital System's Problems. In the context of health reform, the public network of
hospitals, health centers, and other health facilities was supposed to (i) compete with and complement the
private network of health providers, and (ii) sell services to the affiliated population through the EPS and
ARS providers. Simultaneously, since the National System of Social Security in Health (Sistema
Nacional de Seguridad Social en Salud, SNSSS) did not cover the entire population, the public hospitals
provided services to those not affiliated with an insurer.
47. Health Financing Problems. One of the key problems in the sources of health system financing,
affecting both the contributory and the subsidized regimes, is evasion in the contributory regime.
48. FOSYGA Accounts. Another issue relates to the use of the Solidaritv and the ECAT accounts of
FOSYGA. By law, the contributions going into these accounts are to be used for expansion of health
inqiire cot.prnverse nf the poor. The use of these acnounts has been subjecit to expenditulre ceilings. In
itself, this policy practice can be justified as a way of enabling the GOC to control aggregate spending
better. The problem, howpver, is that the unused reso irpoe app,mnlateAd ln thaes account s have ben .e
to finance other expenditures.
49. Accountability, transparency and information problems. Aggravating the above problems are various
deiiciencies in the assignment of responsioilities, information availability, and oversignt. Tnese
deficiencies, which affect the efficient functioning of a decentralized and managed competition health
care system, include: (i) lack of clarity in the assignment of responsibilities; (ii) weak supervision of
health insurers and providers of care; (iii) delays in fund transfers due to complicated and non-transparent
bureaucratic processes; and (iv) inadequate information and mobilization of the reform's intended
beneficiaries.

54. Equally important are institutional factors. Weaknesses in the design of the decentralization and

completed report prod-uced by a group of locai and international experts (including PAHO) in cooperation
with the Ministry of Health.
16Tne weakening of Colombia's immunization program and surveillance system could have serious consequences. For examnpie,

age in Colombia (17% of all children in this age group) are susceptible to measles. With this nunber of susceptible children, the
reintroduction of measles virus into Colombia could result in a large outbreak with considerable consequences in terms of
morbidity, cost of medical care, and mortality among the very young and malnourished. Without major infusion of new funds and
major institutional and organizat-onal strengthening the programi, coverage levels would either decline sligmhiy or wouid be
maintained at approximately current levels, in a best-case scenario.

(3) Education
55. Like other modem states, Colombia recognizes the fundamental importance of education in the
economic and social development of a country - and the critical role of the government in education
finance, provision and regulation. While education alone does not guarantee sustained high economic
growth, poverty reduction and stability, its considerable value added when combined with sound
governance and economic policies is undeniable. Colombia recognizes the contributions of education to
the economic and social well-being of its citizens.
56. With a growing economy and increasing share of GDP going to education attributable to the 1991
Constitutional mandate, Colombia achieved notable educational progress.17 Enrollment rates rose in the
first half of the nineties compared to the mid-eighties. In the second half, however, enrollment rates did
not change, as the economy faltered and funding increases became unsustainable. The stagnation in
education coverage and availability of additional public funds for education illustrates the challenge of
achieving additional educational progress in the coming years.
5'7 Despite its nrhievementg the Cnlnmhinn ediirmdnn system h2c room for further imnrovempntc Tn thig
regard, there are five critical issues related to the country's education system: (i) low and inequitable
educatinna! conerae, ( lw inn  ntornoal efficiency and eAducatin muialhti (iii) eAduation fnance anA
resource use issues; and (iv) decentralization weaknesses, and (v) civil conflict.
58. Low and inequitable coverage. Educational. coverage remains inadequate in relation to the
requirements of a miodern econom  y and the needs of tue poor. Enrollment in prescouul prograls is
approximately 40% of the school-age population. Primary, secondary and tertiary education enrollment
rates are lower than other middle income countines.-8
17 The enrollment rate at the primary level is far from universal - only about 85%, compared to the avenge of 97% for middle
income countries. Similarly, the secondary net enrollment rate of 62. 1% is less than the middle income country average of 71%.
This situation has been worsened by the recent economic crisis, which appears to have affected the schooling of the very poor (in
income quintiles i and 2) at this educationai level.
20



59. A important aspect of this issue is reducing educational inequality. The problem manifests itself in
several ways: (i) Colombia's education Gini coefficient, which is higher than other countries in the
region, such as Mexico and Chile; (ii) the failure of the urban-rural education gap to narrow even during
periods of rapid GDP and public spending growth; and (iii) disparities in educational attainment among
the poorest, middle, and richest income groups, which have increased over the last few years.
60. Internal efficiency and learning achievement problems. The Colombian education system is
characterized by weaknesses at all grade levels, and particularly by repetition in the first grades of
primary education. Although the internal efficiency of the system is improving, some changes still need
to be made.
61. With respect to student learning achievement, results from the National Evaluation System for the
Quality of Education (SABER) indicate that a majority of primary school students in grades 3 and 5 have
an academic level below that of their age level. The performance of Colombian students on the recent
UNESCO/OREALC assessment is in a median position when compared with other countries in the
region. Furthermore, scores indicate a high level of disparitv between the achievement of urban students
and their rural counterparts, who scored consistently lower.
62. Low educational quality in Colombia is due to both school-related factors and broader socioeconomic
Cnnditionm raiwh as ponvertv Amnno the schnnl-rpntp fantntr the mnrev imr%nurtant are: () deficie.ncies in
teacher training and/or allocation (most teachers want to be in urban areas); (ii) weak curriculum

inadequate supervision; (iv) non-conducive school environment; and (v) limited time on task.
63. Education finance and resource use issues. Taken together, the public spending on education is

education spending amounted to 5.7% of GDP, which is more than that of the average middle income
country (auo-ut 4.8%o i99-i;9i). Colombia also spends more tnan other Latiun American countries,
especially if private education spending (4.2% for Colombia) is included in the comparison. The above
discussion confirms tne view that in Colombia there is scope for expanding educational coverage and
improving student achievement, by focusing on efficiency gains and better targeting of educational
assistance to the poor.
64. The scope for efficiency gains can be substantial. Evidence on opportunities for getting more outputs
from existing educational resources can be drawn from various experiments (e.g. Bogota's innovative
scheme for use of non-governmental providers of education services and the PACES voucher
experiment). Their experience reveals that education can be provided at a lower unit cost, while
maintaining, if not improving, educational outcomes through innovative methods of education delivery
and the use of performance-linked contracts with non-government providers. The implication is that more
students can be enrolled with currently available educational resources.
65. Contributing to the weakness of the education system is Colombia's education finance system.
Financial transfers to the territorial entities are determined by the supply of teachers, rather than by the
education needs of the student population. This tendency is partly due to the perverse incentives created
by the FEC.20
19 Based on data from the same study, relative to other Latin American countries Colombia does much better in rural areas,
mainly in math Only CuVba does better. These results are due in part to the success of a pedagogical model, Escuela Nueva
(EN).

incentive for departments and districts to hire new teachers without due consideration of long term cost implications.
21



66. Weaknesses in the design and implementation of decentralization. The decentralization process has
had limited success. Colombia has clearly implemented the decentralization of education management
and operation in accordance with the Constitution. The municipality has now become a central player
with the responsibility, autonomy, and resources to imnlement nrimarv and secondary education
programs. For decentralization to fulfill its education objectives, however, a variety of challenges and
issues have to addressed- Brieflv- they incluide:

of the main contributing factors to the increased rate of crime and violence among Colombian youth.
Complicating the situation, however, is that violence itself has had the effect of limiting access to
education facilities by both users and providers.
(4) Employment and Training
68. Employment is a key element in poverty reduction. For the poor, who have little physical capital, it is
often the only means for earning income legitimately. Employment opportunities allow the poor to
mobilize available labor and increase household income. They also give the poor bargaining power for
higher wages. eventually as labor supply becomes relatively scarce.
69. Empirical evidence on the imnortance of emnloymnent to the poor is discimqed in Rank Renort No.

answer is to increase aggregate demand.21 Another answer is that there are underlying factors determining

respect to its effect on employment.22 The employment impact of regulations has been found to be
particularly detrimental to young, female and informally-employed workers. Tne young suffer not only
foregone current income, but also future income due to the lack of opportunities for training on the job as
a result of reduced formal employment.
21 Employment clearly responds to aanrezate demand fluctuations, with an elasticitv close to 80%. Bo2ota's aforementioned
experiment is an attempt to overcome the detrimental effects of this policy and can provide valuable lessons for other areas.

signed Efliciency Agreements, linking funding to outputs. Despite thes advances, however, impact

3. THE GOVERNMENT REFORM PROGRAM
73. The Colombian government has initiated various steps to address the social sector challenges
articulated in the previous section. These steps are aimed at securing the present and future well being of
Colombians and encompass both remedial and structural measures that have been develoned with sunnort
from the Bank and the IDB. This section summarizes the various social sector policies and actions which
the pronnoed lending oneration would sunnort in parallel writh MT)R's qnnial sectnr lnan. Tt nresents the
rationale for these policies and describes their relevance to achieving the outcomes set fort in the GOC's

strategy for sustaining social progress. It needs to adopt a new strategy based on improving efficiency and

held belief that the state should extend a helping hand to citizens in need, particularly to the marginalized
popwuation, the vulnerable and the victimIs of te internal conflict.
75. hLIe policies thaLt make utlp Colombia's reform program, including its overall strategic vision and the
social sector strengthening initiative, are described in the government's Letter of Development Policy
(Annex D). Tne authorities' ownersnip of the program is strong and widespread, and tne President of
Colombia has expressed the GOC's commitment to continue implementing reforms until the very end of
his administration (see letter of President Pastrana, Annex C). While supporting the (GC's full reform
program, the Bank will explicitly require certain key commitments for the disbursement of the loan under
the proposed SECAL operation, as elaborated later.
76. Colombia's social sector program seeks to strengthen the state's institutional capacity, the incentive
structures of the main social problems, transparency and citizens' participation in order to achieve the
following objectives:
(a) Improved health care by: (i) increasing immunization rate; (ii) raising health insurance coverage;
and (iii) strengthening the quality of health insurance agencies and health service providers;
(b) Human capital accumulation through (i) the expansion of enrollment at all levels of education,
including preschools; (ii) increased student learning; and (iii) improved on-the-job training
opportunities; and
(c) Adequate protection to key population groups against the life threatening and crippling effects of
poverty and economic crisis by establishing an integrated Social Risk Management System and
related measures to: (i) launch a counter-cyclical social assistance system; (ii) improve the
poverty targeting of social protection programs; (iii) effectively assist key underserved vulnerable
grF0in p including nre-school children- the elderly and the internally disnlaced nninlatinn; and (iv)
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of social assistance programs through improved
tarrpt:nc, i-net-nrppnuprv mnnitnring and en1v_livtinn



(1) Social Safety Net
77. To address the social consequences of the 1998 economic crisis, GOC introduced the Red de Apoyo
Soc.;al (Sfo. cial Support   DA,   lnt   .-A tha.t is.  -e workare, c         tion,alcash

evaluation of these new initiatives and their eventual integration into a counter-cyclical social protection
system to aauress ruture cinses.
78. Tne GOC's recognition of the structural deficiencies of the country's sociai protection system and the
delays in the delivery of urgently needed assistance during the 1998-99 crisis led to a serious re-thinking
of the system. Consequently, the RAS program has been followed by continuing dialogue and
consultation between the GOC, the Bank and the IDB on measures to strengthen the country's social
safety net system. The discussions are reflected in the aforementioned social safety report on Colombia
produced by the Bank and the GOC in close collaboration with the IDB.
79. Based on those discussions, GOC 'has developed a reform program for its social safety net and
requested Bank and IDB parallel financial support. The program includes: (i) establishing a social risk
management system that would include a counter-cyclical strategy to address vulnerabilities in times of
crisis; (ii) improving poverty targeting instruments and outcomes; and (iii) reforming social assistance
programs to improve their efficiency and effectiveness vis-a-vis key vulnerable groups.
80. The "Sistema Social de Riesgo ". Sionificant initial steps have been taken toward establishing a
'Social Risk Management System' (Sistema Social de Riesgo) 3 that would be based on principles of risk
prevention; mitigation and coping and would define the role of social protection particularly during
periods of crisis. As a first step a "Social Protection Fund" is being established as the principal financial
instnrment to support the svytem; The fiund would simnort social aqqiRtance snending durinu recessions
once there have been two consecutive trimesters of negative GDP growth. The fund would accumulate

accumulation stipulates that 50% of the difference between actual income and estimated income given 4%
GDP gro-th   ould be allocated to the fund.24 The GrC' s proposed otratAe±o, which has recently been
approved by CONPES, is to establish the fuid by legislation in 2002.
81. Improving Poverty Targeting. The proxy means testing system SISBEN (Sistema de Selecci6n de

programs in Colombia. The updating consists of (i) improving the SISBEN poverty estimation instrument
and methodology; (ii) developing a system of norms guverniug tle applicaiion of he SISBEN inst um ent
to assess poverty levels, a function carried out by municipalities; (iii) monitoring and evaluating the
quality of the information coliected by consolidating dataDases, carrying out fieid-based spot reviews and
evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the instrument; (iv) applying a system of sanctions and
incentives aimed at minimizing the manipulation of SISBE-N and rewarding its regular use and updating;
and (v) establishing clear norms and procedures between local and central levels for reporting and
resolving problems and ensuring the transparent use of the instrument. It is anticipated that a full re-
application of SISBEN will be completed by 2005. Nonetheiess, the success of this effort will depend on
municipalities' ability to successfully apply SISBEN in their local areas.

courses or thie CLasy de CompensaciOn toward well-targeted social assistiuce programs has, howe-ver, not
been considered.
(2) Education and Training
83. To put the GOC's adjustment efforts in education and health in proper perspective, it is important to
view them in relation to recent reforms involving fiscal strengthening. These reforms sought to address
weaknesses in Colombia's fiscal accounts; shortcomings in intergovernmental fiscal relations;
inefficiencies in the provision of key public services, including education and health; and increasing fiscal
pressure from the pension system and public sector debt. This fiscal strengthening agenda would put the
non-financial public sector accounts on a more sustainable path while contributing to enhancing and
improving the provision of social services.
84. Intergovernmental relations. The govemment program  in intergovemmental fiscal relations is
particularly relevant because of the decentralization of health and education to territorial entities. In this
regard, reforms include: (i) making subnational govemments fully responsible for expenditures; (ii)
increasing subnational tax revenues: (iii) simplifving and making more transDarent the transfer svstem;
and (iv) reducing moral hazard from subnational borrowing and reinstate hard budget constraints.
85. As laid out in the Bank's report on the Structural Fiscal Adjustment Loan25, the Colombian Congress
recently approved aConstitutional reform (Arto Legivlativo) that see-ks to tde-link transfers fronm tnrrent
revenues, and put the -growth of transfers from the central govermment to the territorial entities on a more

proportionally, but only after adjusting for the transfers made during years where real GDP growth was less than 2% (2002-05)
or 2.5% (20068-0).

86. Reform of Law 60. The Constitutional reform of transfers is complemented by the amendment of the
1993 Law 60, which specifies the mechanism for distribution of resources among territorial entities.
These reforms, over the long term, will help to (i) reduce earmarking of transfers so that they specify only
the sector allocation (for example, education and health), not the economic category (for example, wages
and investment); and (ii) distribute all transfers on a capitation basis to pay for social services (as
equalization grants to entities with lower than average per capita tax bases).
87. With respect to exDenditures. the authorities seek to control the cost of general administration of
subnational levels and to allocate public resources more closely toward the original design of
decentrali7ation in the Constitution-which foresaw an Allocation according to service needis by
population, with adjustments for poverty, among other factors. To control general administration costs,

(severance pay, etc.) under the terms of Law 617 of 2000.
88. The amendment of Law 60 (Law 715) includes, inter alia, (i) the automatic certification of

approach.
89. More specifically, the automatic certification or performance agreements will imply that (i) the
transfer of resources to municipalities will be calculated on the basis of the number of students who attend
class (not the number of teachers on the payroll); (ii) minimum coverage goals will be established with
the objectives of increasing enrollment and reducing drop-out ratios; (iii) certified mumcipalities will be
authorized to reallocate resources from teacher vacancies-both existing and new-within the education
sector and to eliminate teacher positions; (iv) certified municipalities will be able to reallocate teachers
within the local jurisdiction; and (v) the Ministry of Education will provide technical assistance to
certified municipalities, if requested. The central government will publish and otherwise disseminate
quarterly performance monitoring and evaluation reports of the certified municipalities.
90. Application of the new model of allocating national transfers for education among municipalities will
require enabling regulations. While Law 715 has specified the principle that the allocation should be
based on number of students, population to be attended, and poverty indicator, the details of how it will
actually be implemented (e.g. regarding the indicators, weights and procedures to be used) have still to be
worked out. GOC will issue regulations that would enable consistent and effective application of the
resource allocation model.
91. Additional measures. To support these education sector strengthening objectives, additional measures
would be undertaken, including:
*  Doulme-nt and publish suc-cessfiui experiences writh education delivery approarhes based on
performance (concession) contracts with non-governmental providers as well as voucher
programs scl,h -Q PACES;
*  Establish regulatory framework that would enable public educational institutions to contract

(3) Health
93. Through the new Law 715, GOC has taken important steps to address some of the problems facing
Colombia's health system. Law 7 i 5, which aims to promote transparency and accountability in the heaith
system as well as to reward performance, stipulates:
* The distribution of transfers (allocated to the health sector out of the above-mentioned Sistema
General de Participationes) among public hospitals, insurance coverage and public health.
* Speeding up of the flow of transfers from departments to hospitals and from municipalities to
ARSs;
*  Clearer assignment of responsibilities; and
* The distribution of resources among territorial entities based on performance related factors.
94. Under the old system of allocation established by the Law 60 of 1993, there is no clear assignment of
rQesonsihilitipe as far as  plyniv and demand subidies and pulic hpaith arp recncernedA Transfers follow.
a complicated path from the national government to territorial entities (departments and municipalities) to
heal. c..t.+anAm,,c1rotnre -A -e) and _r lly, to health care providers. This p.rocess h0 create delays
in the flow of transfers and resulted in the accumulation of debt among the various entities involved.
95. Under the new law, departments will assume responsibility for public and private hospitals, while
Ulp0UaillJ4llWw Wlil 00Weslts 1GeJVUi0U1liLt jUV B1 1.CAW1UM bUir  ULUV_llrV VI LLUt W UUelUJlEW lCQlIL1IV. VJU leeUs
of public health, such as vaccination, municipalities will be responsible for the execution of the
in-irnunization prograns anu, uaccrdingly, will receive the necessary funds. In he case of public
hospitals, resources will be allocated according to the number of vinculados in the department, while in
the case of subsidized insurance according to the number of aftiliates in the municipality (vinculados are
persons eligible for subsidized health insurance that are not yet affiliated with ARS).
96. The new law is expected to spur the transition from a supply to a demand-based subsidy system.
Given that the number of vinculados wil have been decreased and the public restructuring program will
have contributed to limiting costs, resources per vinculado will be higher. This will pernit a greater
allocation of resources to financing the expansion of coverage among the poor through the subsidized
regime, relative to direct subsidy to hospitals.
97. With respect to vaccinations, targets for optimum levels of vaccination coverage will be set and the
monitoring of whether the targets are met will be used to adjust the amount of resources allocated to
municipalities.

9R Rvtru.eurin47g o   -fpubl.ic hospitals. Tn response to the problems facedA b theti pic  si- ev4al na-.eo-rlr
some steps have been taken to restructure public hospitals. The objectives of this restructuring program

bargaining agreements with hospital unions.
99. To achieve the second objective, the program includes actions such as (i) reaching agreements
Wetween teritoria enuties anu hospital directors to advance iong-iasting restructuring and To develop
functional health service networks and (ii) identifying and analyzing existing information regarding
supply and demand for health services in different regions in order to better define pians for manageriai
and technology improvements. Preliminary results from a pilot program aiming to restructure 27
hospitals (out of a total of about i 70 medium and highi complexity public facilities) administered by the
Ministry of Health appear to be positive - in one year hospital costs have been reduced by 30%.
100.  SISBEN improvement. As previously mentioned in relation to the social safety net discussion, the
government has initiated a reform of the SISBEN proxy means testing system that allows for the targeting
of public subsidies to the poor. SISBEN ,has been used primarily to identify beneficiaries qualifying for
affiliation to the subsidized health regime. The new guidelines for the reformed targeting system have
recently been approved by the CONPES 'and include: (i) adjustment of the identification instrument (the
SISBEN index) to capture regional differences and dynamic aspects and a strategy for the adoption of the
new instrument; (ii) a system of quality control and centralized monitoring through regular evaluations of
the SISBEN surveys and punitive measures in cases where the municipality responsible for its application
has an identification error greater than 15%; and (iii) strengthening supervision and administration at the
local level.
101.  ISS-Health services. In an effort to address the Social Security Institute's (ISS) financial
problems, the government has agreed on a restructuring Dlan for ISS-Health services. The main
objectives of this plan is to improve quality of services to affiliates, eliminate inefficient supply subsidies
to ISS hospitals (ISS-IPS) and limit fiscal costs to the national government. The ISS-Health is currently
facing both 'stock' and 'flow' problems that need to be addressed. With respect to its existing
accumulated deficit7 the nrnomrm includies (i) trnsferring of resou1rces to the ISS only after the
renegotiation with collective bargaining agreement with its labor unions has been successfully completed,

i02.  aolidariy account of FSu'iA. According io tne Estatuto Orgamico de Presupuesto tme solidarity
account of FOSYGA forms part of the national budget, thus has a limit/ceiling of expenditure. This has
resulted in resources accumulating in the account, which subsequently had on occasion been used for
purposes other than the ones defined by the solidarity account. GOC is about to issue a regulation
stipulating the exclusive use of the said accumulated resources for financing subsidized health insurance
coverage, as originally intended. Putting it differently, if the decision is taken that accumulated resources
above the expenditure ceiling of the account are to be used, these resources can only be employed to
finance the subsidized health insurance regime.
29



103.  Strengthening of the National Health Superintendency. The GOC has started to address the
budgetary problems and other issues hampering the ability of the Health Superintendency in carrying out
its responsibility of oversight, control and monitoring of insurers (EPSs and ARSs), health care providers
and territorial entities. Following the principles governing the operation of other superintendencies in
Colombia, a decree is about to be signed enabling the Health Superintendency to charge a fee to the
entities that are under its supervision. This measure will enable the Health Superintendency to carry out
its fiduciary responsibility more effectively.
104.  Additionally, GOC will (i) complete a business study currently being carried out by the Health
SuDerintendency analyzing its oDeration and wavs of strengthening its Derformance, and (ii) disseminate
systematically to the public its assessment of the performance of its supervisees. The former will enable
the Health Sunerintendencv to set clear targets and develon supervision strategies and benchmarks, while
the latter will provide information to eligible affiliates for making informed choices regarding insurers
and health care providers. The last point is expectpd to improve qullity control, as they will be winder
greater pressure to perform better, as informed clients tend to stay away from unreliable entities with bad

select the uisurinCe provider and health care package of their choice.
106.  Strengthening the immunization program. hiie Ministry of Health (MIGH) has snown resolve to
strengthen the EPIVPAI immunization program. In collaboration with Panamerican Health Organization
(PAHO`), nationai autnorities conducted a detailed evaluation of the entire nationai vaccination program.
The GOC has now allocated the funds necessary to purchase vaccines and syringes and to carryout a
nationai vaccination campaign in 2002. I ne governrment has aiso ciarified the responsibilities between the
MOH and the National Institute of Health (INS) in terms of EP1VPAI coordination and supervision at the
national level.
107.  Equally noteworthy, the MOHIINS in collaboration with the local PAHO office, is developing a
detailed needs analysis for the national cold chain to ensure adequate storage and transport of vaccines.
Moreover, the MOH is developing performance indicators for monitoring vaccination coverage levels at
the municipality level and has begun to address the development of a functional information system for
the collection, analysis and dissemination of infornation on vaccination activities. The above indicators
will be used to certify compliance by the private sector with vaccination guidelines and the information
system will monitor the number of vaccine doses given by provider as well as by geographic location.
108.  However, to ensure the efficient functioning of the EPI/PAI program and to ensure achievement
of acceptable coverage levels, the government is initiating the following additional steDs to accelerate the
implementation of needed reforms and address issues that have lead to poor vaccination practices (e.g.,
missed opportunities to vaccinate):



*  Development and completion of a detailed Plan of Action based on the recommendations from the
National Evaluation that clearly specifies short and long-term activities to remedy weaknesses in the
national EPI/PAI program. These activities will be coupled with performance indicators to measure
their implementation and their impact.
*  Pilot testing of the computer software PAISOF-2 and development of a plan for its national
application to ensure access to adeciuate and accurate information to monitor Derformance via
standard indicators.

exchange of information between providers to eliminate missed opportunities to vaccinate due to
either lack of informnation sharing or to restrictive billi;ng procedur-es.
(4) Transparency and Citizens' Oversight
109.  Through the creation of SINERGIA, the Government of Colombia has made important advances
in estaDiishing a founuation for ennanced governance tmrougnt me use of key performance indicators.
Building on this solid base, the GOC proposes to (i) move beyond monitoring and establish periodic
impact arid performance evaluations of the main public sector programs financed by the national
government, and (ii) establish a system of public monitoring to improve transparency and accountability.
110.  Under this new policy, impact evaluations would first be carried out of ICBF's daycare and
nutrition programs as well as of the main SENA training programs. The results of these evaluations will
be produced by the end of 2004 and made available at the same time as the RAS safety net program
evaluations allowing for the next administration to carry out a comprehensive review of the social safety
net system. The system of public monitoring will bring to the general public information that has to date
been the purview of central government officials. Adapting the successful model of "Bogota Como
Vamos" implemented at the municipal level, the central government will establish a public inforipation
and monitoring system that will not only give the public information about the central government's
performance, but also allow the central government to benefit from public opinion and open dialogue with
its citizens.

medium term strategic agenda follow up activities the Bank deems critical to carry forward the reforms
the loan is supporting. Lhird, in light of thie breakdo-wn in the peace pruoces, w-eak woumiic growut and
financial uncertainty, the loan aims to provide the GOC needed financial cushion as well as support for
social measures complementing the fiscal reforms under the Structurai riscai Adjustment Loan (SFAL).
Together, these objectives establish a foundation for the expansion of key reforms that with follow up
actions can significantly contribute to the advancement of social sector strengthening and the politicai
sustainability of fiscal reforms.
112.  Table 4.1 presents the tranche release conditions, key strategic goals and actions for the next few
years (medium term framework), and the progress indicators for monitoring achievement of said goals.
This medium term framework provides a "road map" on how the activities being promoted by the
operation would ultimately lead through follow up actions to sustained improvements in education, health
and social protection, particularly of the poor and vulnerable. Although the goals and actions listed under
the medium term framework are not legally binding, they have been endorsed by the GOC in its Letter of
Development Policy (Annex D) and are consistent with the views expressed by the technical team of
incoming Administration. The list under the column "Policy Actions for SECAL Tranche Release"
present the legally agreed actions that would constitute conditions for Board approval and trigger a one
tranche disbursement of the loan. The specificity and definition of the conditions as well as the evidence
of compliance are discussed in Annex G.

21 These are the Community Works and Employment Project, Human Capital Protection Project, Colombia Social Safety Net
Assesment and the Colombia Poverty ReDort.



114.  Looking to the future, the proposed SECAL would set the stage for the next phase of social sector
reforms by supporting: (i) the restructuring of traditional, calcified social assistance programs including
the large ICBF child welfare program; (ii) the establishment of a system of periodic impact and
performance evaluations of social programs, beginning with an analysis of the main safety net programs
and the SENA training program to lay the groundwork for a full social assistance reform; (iii) reforms in
health and education service provision and financing, as outlined above; (iv) attention to the internally
displaced population, one of the most vulnerable groups in Colombia today; and (v) enhanced
Government transparency and accountability in the social sectors through information dissemination and
dialogue. These initiatives will be carried forward in the medium term, as laid out in Table 4.1.
115.  With respect to financial objectives, the GOC is counting on the proceeds of this proposed loan to
ensure that it will be able to protect both its social and discretionary investment expenditures, which
might have to be cut if the country is forced to resort to higher interest private financing. Recent data
indicating weak economic growth and greater financial uncertainty coupled with the breakdown in the
peace have reinforced this concern. Beyond the financial cushion it would provide, the operation would
balance the Bank's assistance to Colombia by providing a vehicle for addressing social deficits, as a
complement to the fiscal deficits addressed by the SFAL.
116.   The diffusion of innovative education delivery models supported by the SECAL could improve
the access of populations affectpd by violenre to good eduration as these population are generally located
in the areas targeted by the education reforms.
117.   Finally, the tranche release conditions in the proposed SECAL complement the SFAL and the
recen..Uuy approved 1TB  sc  wr loan. A coma - omf we SECAT tranche rlease  nAitions 1fith
those of the SFAL and the IDB loan is presented in Annex H. Given the parallel financing between this
prop-osedu SECtu arld '=eI 1BAJJ Ivan, *.ra are, both overlaps and su;-r; co.pAF1le...er.t :.nL UIe UancheL release
conditions between the two loans. It should be mentioned, however, that only those measures that were
taken recently or about to be completed have been indcluded in tiis SECa-'s policy matrUx. WitU respect
to the Bank's SFAL, it should also be noted that this SECAL's tranche release conditions complement but
do not overlap with the legal conditions stipulated in the SFAL's policy matrix, except the general
macroeconomic condition. Close coordination with 1DB has been and will be maintained to ensure policy
consistency and facilitate implementation of the conditions.

118.   Economic risks. The WOC has demonstrated strong and continued commitment to prudent
macroeconomic management and structural reform, but there remain significant internal and external
risks that could affect the fiscal accounts, as discussed in Section 1. On the external front, the principal
risk is posed by the threat of further deterioration in the external macroeconomic environment led by a
deeper slowdown or recession in the world economy. The most important transmission channels are (i) a
further deterioration in the terms of trade, particularly resulting from continued unfavorable coffee prices
and volatile oil prices; and (ii) the closure of access to international financial markets due to crises in
major markets and/or emerging market countries.
119. On the internal front, the major risks concern the fragility of Colombia's economic recovery,
compounded by the collapse of the peace process. As mentioned earlier, in 2001 the economy grew 1.6
percent, down from 2.8 percent a year earlier, although it still higher than the Latin America average.
Prospects for an acceleration of growth are hampered by weak domestic demand, high unemployment,
and low rates of private investment. The problem is exacerbated by the recent collanse of neace
negotiations with the FARC, the country's largest guerrilla group, and the return to open hostilities which
coultd negatively affect the investment climate as well as the (knvernment's fical nrnoram (due to
pressures for increases in military expenditure and spending to rebuild damaged infrastructure).  In

macroeconomic conditions is more difficult now than six months ago. However, given the GOC's
increased effort to maintain fiscal discipline, raise revenues, and controi public expenditures, the risk of
non-compliance remains moderate and within manageable range. Currently, Colombia's program with the
iMF remains on track, following some easing of fiscal targets due to iower-than-projected growth and
revenues. There is some likelihood that the fiscal targets might be eased again in 2002 should growth be
weaker than the 2.5-3 percent currently projected. It should be noted, too, that slower growth could mean
that deposits to the counter-cyclical social protection fund would not be made in the foreseeable future.
While not a specific condition of the proposed loan, slower build-up of the counter-cyclical social
protection fund would undoubtedly lead to some delay in advancing Colombia's efforts to develop a more
responsive system of social protection. Second, while delays in the legislative approval of the previously
mentioned reforms (pensions, fiscal responsibility and territorial taxes) are unlikely to have more than a
modest fiscal impact in the short-run -- thus not immediately affecting the country's macro-balances -
progress in each of these areas is critical for medium and long-term fiscal sustainability and will need to
be addressed by the incoming administration as a matter of priority.

121. Timing and political risks. The presentation of a single-tranche loan to be disbursed by the end
of the current Adrninistration's ter-m was deemed an importanti risk during the preparation of this
operation. Given the expectation of a new Congressional session in July and an inauguration of a new
Administration on August 7, 2002, there was considerable concern that the various reform initiatives
embodied in the SECAL might not be embraced by an incoming administration, with the attendant risk
that actions already taken might be reversed and/or that little would be done in the way of follow up.
This risk has been substantially mitigated in recent weeks, however, by the decisive first-round election
results which have enabled discussion of the SECAL with the incoming team of President-elect Uribe
prior to presentation of this loan to the Board. Indeed, discussions with Mr. Uribe's team have clarified
that the incoming administration strongly endorses the operation and, cognizant of the urgent financial
needs of Colombia, is in full support of presentation of the proposed loan to the Board before the change
of government. Moreover, given the strong electoral showing enjoyed by Mr. Uribe there is clearly a very
promising political foundation for moving forward the reform agenda of fiscal discipline, economic
reforms, and social development This expectation is reinforced by the consultations undertaken by the
Bank during loan preparation with a wide variety of stakeholders from across the political spectrum,
which indicated broad support for the medium-term social sector strategy being supported by this
operation.. Finally, it is worth noting, that the operation supports programs that are already providing
substantial benefits to their target population and have considerable popular support. The most important
example is the expansion of the affiliation of poor families with the subsidized health regime (ARS). In
the second semester of 2001, a total of 1,554,852 poor persons were added to the ARS, implying an
additional amount of roughly $ 118 million ner year of direct assistance to the noor and accelerating the
supply-to-demand transformation of Colombia's health system.

and Disbursements and Audits
122.  The proposed (US$155 million) SECAL in the form of a fixed spread, U.S.-dollar-denominated
loan would be made to the Republic of Colombia. Disbursements under the proposed loan wouid be
made to an account (Deposit Account) of the Republic of Colombia, established at the Banco de la
Repubiica for this purpose. As mentioned, the proposal is to disburse the loan in one tranche upon Board
approval. This tranche arrangement has been designed with the Government and reflects the GOC's and
the Bank's assessment of the necessary timing for implementing the proposed conditions.
123. To ensure compliance with financial safeguards, the Government is committed to continue
improving public expenditure management, including both procurement and financial management, and
combating corruption. Over the last few years, the Bank (at the authorities' request) has undertaken a
substantial amount of analytical work to support the Government's efforts for improving public
expenditure management. This included Colombia-Country Financial Accountability Assessment
(September 1998); a second Country Financial Accountability Assessment, which is scheduled to be
carried out in FY03, and will pay particular attention to financial accountability arrangements at the sub-
national and municipal levels; the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR, March 2001); the
Public Financial Management Project (PFMP-I, closed March 2001); and the on-going PFMP-IH
(Februarv 2001) which follows and expands on the earlier project. In addition, the Bank has sunported
the Government's anti-corruption program through the World Bank Institute as well as an Institutional
Development Facility (MDF) rant comnleted earlier this year.

124.   The Government of Colombia has established a Public Procurement Project in the National
Plannina Denartment, which is working on the development of a naner on national nrocurement policy
based on the recommendations of the CPAR. The recommendations to imnprove procurement include the
estahlishme_1nt of an institutinnal frampwork fnr an ordprly and cornsistent development and dissepmination
of policies, regulations, and standard bidding and contract documentation.  In addition, CPAR

through two specific Bank operations-the PFMP I and the follow-on PFMP II-both highly praised by
QAG, and recentuy comiipleted sector work on corruption.
125.   Moreover, tnese two projects have also supported the Government of Colombia's measures to
strengthen institutional capacity and analysis in a number of key areas of public expenditure, such as
macro-programming, formulation and monitoring of the budget, budget execution-including the
development and implementation of an Integrated Financial Management System (SIFf)- and evaluation
of results of public expenditure-including the implementation of the National System for Evaluation of
Results of Public Sector Performance (SINERGIA). Despite important progress in areas of public
expenditure, further strengthening of financial management processes is needed. These deficiencies
include (i) divergence between budgeted expenditures and the Government's strategic development
priorities; (ii) lack of clarity regarding the roles and reporting requirements of government institutions;
and, (iii) the need to enhance public sector transparency and accountability by improving the
dissemination of the objectives, performance evaluations and budgetary results of public entities. The on-
going PFMP II is supporting reforns in these areas. In April 2002 an inter-institutional committee was
commissioned, comprised of representatives of the Office of Controller General, the Accountant General
and the Bank, with a mandate is to make recommendations for the strengthening of Financial
Management arrangements for projects implemented in Colombia. The recommendations will be
submitted to the various authorities by June 30, 2002. The recommendations will be submitted to the
various authorities by June 30, 2002.
126.  In addition, the IMF's safeguard assessments report on the audit mechanism for the Colombian
central h!ani nnmpleted in May 201 unider the tr- nsitiona procedures, conclulded that the cuirrent
auditing arrangements are capable of providing high-quality audit services. However, while external

127.  For the purpose of SECAL's disbursement and audits, prior to furnishing to the Bank the request
for withdrawal from the Loan Account, the Government will open and thereafter maintain in its central
bank, a deposit account in dollars on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bahk. All withdrawals from
the Loan Account will be denosited bv the Bank into the Denosit Account. The Bank will monitor and
assess ex-post (through supervision missions with the Government's permission) the use of the Deposit

129.   The proposed SECAL is consistent with the CAS and the World Bank's Social Sector Strategy
for Colombia (Annex E). It is part of a series of social protection projects that the GOC, World Bank and
IDB agreed at the beginning of the economic crisis to assist the poor, particularly those most affected by
the crisis. Two of them are investment projects currently under implementation that form part of the
GOC's Red de Apoyo Social (RAS) safety net strategy: (i) the Community Works and Employment
project which provides temporary employment to poor unemployed workers in urban areas through small
community projects; and (ii) the Human Capital Protection project that funds a conditional cash transfer
program to protect children's health, education, and nutrition.
130.   A% nlanned. the Government has asked the Bank to nrenare the third nroiect of the series, a Social
Sector Adjustment Loan (SECAL) to support structural reforms needed in the social sectors to ensure that
the impnat on novertv and the sustainahilitv of the gove-rnment'q intPrvPntionQ in this arpe are maximi7ze.
As envisioned in the CAS, the operation would assist Colombia in establishing a social protection system
that r>tt  ni4pcu in responseten tar i         and t   _       -geted, rr.ore tranrspr.t ar.d

social development and economic growth. Complementing the SFAL, the SECAL will help (i) protect
the poor from thie poteltial effect of tihe fiscal adUustLI-ent; and (ii) ensure t-hat key socia; sezrvices,
including safety net programs, are targeted to the poor, and delivered more efficiently and effectively. In
the iong run, the social sector strengthening program wouid improve Colombia's social protection system,
while at the same time building up human capital.
132.   The proposed SECAL operation is fully consistent with the strategy proposed in the CAS and
CAS-PR, not only in terms of policy content but also in terms of overaii iending and exposure ilmits. T he
overall external debt exposure of Colombia is relatively high, but manageable (see Annex A9).
B. Complementarity with Other World Bank Operations and Activities
133.   First, as mentioned, the two ongoing Bank operations (the Community Works and the Human
Capital Protection Projects) supporting the government's social assistance program complement the
SECAL. Bank financing for those two projects totals US$250 million.
41



134.   Second, there are the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) for US$500 million (approved
Uy LUV JU.U Boa  1dUVmNoeUUbe 1777) andU UI, recendj appoJVed SUUL.>LUal iscal V1GU0UI11.e LoznU ISFL )1.LC
for $400 million projects. These projects help Colombia achieve economic recovery, sustained economic
growth and stabilitjy- crical conditions for atuaining long terml success in social protection, huLLnan
development and poverty reduction. The FSAL operation supported a comprehensive program of
financial structural reforms that soughit to promote the development of a healthy and s-usainable fiiniancial
system, while the SFAL supports the Colombian government's fiscal strengthening program. The latter
gives the government fiscal space for protecting sociai sector expenditures and impiementing difficult
structural measures-such as reforming transfers and expenditure responsibilities in health and education,
restructuring public hospitals, and redefining pension systems.
135.   Third, two studies have provided analytical information to this operation. The Colombia Poverty
Report assesses and reviews (i) the evolution of poverty and inequality in urban and rural areas over the
past two decades; (ii) the incidence of crime and violence and related household responses; and (iii)
selected aspects of public assistance, including an overview of public social expenditures and a specific
review of the subsidized health insurance system. The Colombia Social Safety Net Assessment evaluates
reforms to Colombia's social safety net, both for addressing the needs of vulnerable groups during normal
times and for developing a counter-cyclical strategy that could be implemented rapidly during future
crises. The study (i) assesses vulnerability and risk management in Colombia; (ii) evaluates how the three
new emergency Red de Apoyo Social safety net programs fit into the broader social safety net over the
long-term; (iii) assesses the efficiency, effectiveness and gaps in Colombia's existing social assistance
programs; and (iv) proposes technical program and policy reforms aimed at improving the social safety
net.
C. Complementarity with Other Institutions' Operations
136. The Bank and IDB are financing in parallel the social sector strengthening program. The IDB has
recently processed a US$390 million social sector loan (approved by its Board on December 19, 2001).
The IDB loan committed GOC to a set of policies and actions laid out in the policy matrix for said loan in
Annex H. This proposed SECAL would not only support the measures agreed with the 1DB, but deepen
and widen the program by including the measures described below.
137.  It should also be mentioned that as part of the Bank's close collaboration with the IDB, the
workfare and conditional cash transfers projects have been designed with IDB and have been also
financed in parallel by the IDB for US$250 million. Finally, the Bank and IDB have coordinated their

A2.Following participatory consuitations with government ieaders and civii society the CAS identified,
and the CAS-PR reconfirmed, the main objectives of poverty reduction, social development and
sustainable economic growth.  Anchored with a stable macro-economic environment and fiscal
sustainability, these objectives were to be achieved by interventions in key areas (a) promoting peace and
development; (b) promoting rural development; (c) developing human capital; (d) attaining public sector
responsiveness and efficiency; (e) improving infrastructure services; and (f) ensuring sustainable
development. These areas of intervention have not changed and continue to be supported by the Bank's
lending program. Furthermore, the CAS-PR recognized that Colombia's economic performance,
especially economic growth and the fiscal balance, had deteriorated since the presentation of the CAS and
recommended strengthening fiscal stability to restore growth and reduce poverty. The CAS-PR confirmed
that a reduction of the fiscal deficit was a key macroeconomic objective of the government, and it
recognized that without a correction of fiscal imbalances, Colombia could face financing gaps and
problems in accessing external financial markets. Worsening economic conditions, combined with
uncertainty as a result of the country's long-standing internal conflict, could hinder the achievement of the
government's objectives as reflected in the CAS. In addition, the international economic and financial
repercussions of the tragic events of September 11 2001 have reinforced the importance of a return to
fiscal sustainability as these repercussions may be severe and could further restrict capital flows to
Colombia and augment the deterioration of the countrv's terms of trade.

justified by (a) the need to cushion the adverse social impact of the economic recession, financial
instability and internal conflict on the poor and vulnerable, and (b) the Government's commitment to
undertake fiscal adjustments and implement structural reforms to be supported by an IMF program. These
trinpers remain valid. Furthermore; the CAS-PR indicated that we would reassess the lending program
and move to a base-case or low-case scenario if (a) the fiscal stabilization program supported by the IMF
nrnoarsm went off track- (h) nroiect imnlemrentation nrnblemc arose; or (G) increaed violence and social
unrest significantly reduced our ability to work effectively in Colombia. These risks have not

A4.    Peace Process. Colombia has been ravaged by intense conflict for the past 40 years, financed in
part by the illegal drug trade. About 40,000 people have died in clashes during the last decade alone.
President Andres Pastrana has made a highly ambitious peace initiative the focus of his administration.
The two main rebel groups in Colombia, the FARC and ELN, as well as the paramilitary group, the AUC,
are on the United States' official list of foreign terrorist organizations. On October 7, 2001, Mr. Pastrana
decided to continue the peace negotiations by extending the demilitarized zone for three months, but with
firmer conditions, most notably the negotiation of a truce and agreements to end kidnappings and attacks
on the civilian population2. The refocused peace discussions will center on a ceasefire and on obtaining
commitments from guerrillas to respect international humanitarian law. Colombia will continue to need
the assistance of the international community to fight terrorism and to address the socio-economic
determinants of violence in order to construct the underpinnings for peace and development.
A5.The Economy. Economic growth for 2001 is now projected to be about 1.5-2.5 percent-down from
last year's n 3 eorent. wliile this un prrtet real econo crra'wlh is above the country's a1fl1! 2av2e

downward trend and is expected to attain the Central Bank's year-end target of 8 percent for 2001. The
balance of payments' current account deficit is projected at 2.6 percent of GDP-up from the deficit of
about 0.2 percent of GDP in 2000. This is due to an increase in domestic demand for imports, and the
simultaneous weakening of traditional exports, particularly oil and coffee.  Nevertheless, gross
international reserves (in months of goods and services) are projected at around six months for the rest of
2001. While these projections take into account the initial impact of the tragic events of September 11,
2001, they will have to be further assessed. Nonetheless, it is certain that the impact on global financial
markets and economic growth will be substantial and that as a result, Colombia's economy will also be
negatively affected, including by restricted access to capital markets and further deterioration of terms of
trade (particularly coffee and oil). Colombia's total external financing needs are projected at about US$ 8
billion per year for the 2001-2003 period. Total public external debt has risen steadily, both in absolute
terms and as a proportion of GDP. In gross terms, it has almost doubled from 27 percent of GDP in 1994
to 50 percent in 2000.
Since then, the negotiations between *e govemnem and FARC brdoe down, ending *e peace process.



Annex A
A6.    The government's macroeconomic program has three pillars (a) sound fiscal management,
including the implementation of fiscal reforms; (b) an inflation-targeting monetary policy; and (c) a
flexible foreign exchange regime. If this macro-economic policy mix is maintained, and given a stable
economic environment, average real economic growth is projected for the medium term (2002-2003) at
about 2.5-3 percent per year, and for the long-term (2004 and on) at about 3-3.5 percent annually, fueled
mainly by investment expansion. As a result of the imrplementation of the forthcoming fiscal reforms and
the continuation of sound macroeconomic management, the deficit of the Non Financial Public Sector
would decline and reach about 1.5 percent of GDP in 2005. Inflation is projected to continue its
downward trend, and to stabilize at about 4 percent in 2003 and beyond. The external current account
deficit would reach about 2-3 percent of GDP, and cross international reserves are projected at about
seven months of goods and services imports. Finally, in this macroeconomic framework, Colombia's net
total public debt would stabilize at abult 50 perce^nt of GDPbby 2005.

requested that the Fund focus on stabilization and balance of payment issues and that the Bank take the
lead on key structural issues. Therefore, the Fund's program concentrates on stabiiization of the fiscal
accounts within the duration of the program, and the Bank has taken the lead in identifying and supporting
key structurai reforms that will contribute to bringing Colombia' s fiscal accounts onto a sustainable path
in the long term. Colombia has so far met, and at times exceeded, the performance targets under the IMF
program; two program reviews have been successfully completed, and the third is expected to be
presented to the Fund's Board in early 2002. All performance indicators are expected to be met with the
exception of the original program targets for the fiscal deficit. The weakness of the economic recovery
this year, combined with external variables such as low commodity prices and the events of September
2001, make it likely that deficit targets for both 2001 and 2002 will be modified in the current program
review - the targeted fiscal deficit is expected to shift from 2.8 to about 3.3 percent of GDP for 2001 and
this adjusted target will be met4.
3~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
3 We support this strategy for several reasons, including: (a) the signal to international markets is working as can
been seen by Colombian spreads, particularly in light of the recent events of Sentember 11: i (b the fsct that the
Central Bank is bound by strict constitutional restrictions against lending to finance the deficit-an exemplary
practice; and, (c) more importantly, the division of labor and responsibilities between the Fund (stabilization and
balance of payments) and the Bank (structural issues).

the portfolio had improved substantially since the presentation of the CAS; this trend has continued.
Portfolio performance in Colombia remains satisfactory. The portfolio currently contains 23 projects, with
net commit ents of about US$ 1.3 billion and an undisbursed balance of about US$663 million. Only one
project is currently rated unsatisfactory. The disbursement ratio was 24.6 percent in FY01, up from 20.2

Its findings will be broadly discussed and its recommenuations incorporated into the next CAS.  nRC
report found that for Bank-assisted projects procurement is carried out in accordance with Bank policies
and procedures, and procurement performance under those projects is generamly satisfactory and free of
major problems. Two procurement audits and four agency procurement capacity assessments carried out
in the last two years have found no major problems and determined that the procurement risk in Bank
projects is lower than average. However, the CPAR found that public procurement and contract
management had deficiencies that had the potential to result in inefficient use of public funds and could be
a source of corruption. The findings and recommendations of the CPAR to strengthen public procurement
were discussed with the Colombian authorities. Following recommendations of the CPAR, the
government is implementing with its own resources a Public Procurement Project. In addition, the second
Public Financial Management Project (PFMP), approved by the Bank Board on March 22, 2001 includes a
component to strengthen public procurement.
AIO. Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA). A CFAA was carried out in September

completed sector work on corruption and by the Bank-financed PFMP I and II. These projects have
supported the government's measures to strengthen institutional capawity and snalvqiq in a nlimber of key

and will have a special focus on sub-national finances. Its recommendations will be incorporated into the
strategy and program of the next CAS.
5 At the time of writing this SECAL, Colombia continues to meet the performance targets under the iMF pmgram.
Three program reviews have now been successfully completed; the fourth and final review is scheduled for

Proposed Bank Lending and Analytical Program Through FY02
All .Lending Program for FY02. As mentioned above, the CAS-PR moved the assistance strategy to a
high-case lending progran, including adjustment lending, to around US$450 million for the lending
program of FY98-01. Including FY02, the proposed lending program would total about 2 billion and
average about US$400 million per year. In FY98 and FY99- we committed TTU$13 12 million and US$142
million, respectively. In FY00, six operations were approved for a total of US$935 million (including the
US$500 million Financial Sector Adiuitment Loan and the exceptional TUSS25 million Rnrthrnilke
Recovery Loan). In FY01 we committed US$185 million. In FY02, we expect to present six operations,
in -ldiiina the QT.AT riirrpntlu iintiar .onnieratiron and tie S,oial Sector AAd,ustme-t T^an (for an art..ont
of about US$150 rnillion). This would bring our proposed FY02 program to about US$630 million. With

Colombia to protect and promote the welfare of the poor through a series of interrelated lending
operations, as well as analytical work.
*  Magdalena Medio H. The Bank has supported this program through a recently completed LIL
(Magdalena Medio Regional Development Project) and will continue its support through a second
LIL approved in September, 2001. The first project was very effective in creating a longer term
vision of a better future for the poor in this region in the midst of conflict. It aims to strengthen
human and social capital, and start a comnmunity-led process of improving basic services and
investment.  The second project will gradually shifting the focus of decision-making and
leadership of the program to local and regional actors, with communities playing a lead role.

2001 to supnort Cnlnmnhiq's initiative to reform mlrniini l water ntilitie: in lindermerveai nirul and

implementation of demand-driven, sustainable subprojects that generate income and employment
opportunities for rurai communities. Tne project would contribute to (i) reactivating the rural
economy; (ii) improving the welfare of poor rural inhabitants; and (iii) generating an enabling
environment for the peace process in the country.
* Judicial Reform. This project constitutes the first phase of a long-term initiative to improve
judicial conflict resolution services in the civil, labor and family law jurisdictions. The proposed
project is expected to have three key impacts (i) improvement of the judiciary's social legitimacy
and ability to respond to society's justice needs; (ii) increased incentives for the resolution of
labor, family and civil conflicts' through peaceful means, thus improving the prevalence of the
nrle of law and peaceful coexistence; and (iii) more effective enforcement of contracts at lower
cost.



Annex A
*  Structural Fiscal Adjustment Loan (SFAL). The proposed SFAL would support Colombia's
efforts to achieve macroeconomic stability and consolidate growth by undertaking structural
reforms that would put the country's fiscal accounts on a sustainable path. The Bank's strategy
would assist the government to (i) ensure that the fiscal decentralization process is economically
sustainable through the reform of intergovernmental fiscal relations, including transfers, and the
imposition of hard budget constraints on subnational governments; (ii) rationalize central
government expenditures to sustain fiscal discipline; and (iii) support structural reforms in sectors
where both national and subnational governments share responsibilities, including education.
health and pensions. The SFAL will ensure that within the fiscal strengthening program, public
resource allocations to social programs are nrotected. narticularly those for health and education.
By consolidating growth and fiscal sustainability, it will support poverty reduction. History has
shown that Cnlnmhia has emivoye4 significant declines in poverty dluring ntrin4ds of nnpitive
growth and fiscal balance. For example, from 1988 to 1995, as average GDP grew at rates of

political instability that negative macro-economic shocks could engender.
* Social Sector Adjustment Loan (SSAL). In order to alleviate the impact of the economic crisis
on the poor, the government asked the Bank and the iDB to support programs targeted to
segments of the population most impacted by the crisis. In this context, the Bank is currently
financing the Community Works and Employment project which provides temporary employment
to poor unemployed workers in urban areas through small community projects. The Bank is also
financing the Human Capital Protection project that funds a conditional cash transfer program to
protect children's health, education, and nutrition. To ensure that the impact on poverty and the
sustainability of the government's interventions in this area are maximized, the government has
asked the Bank to prepare a Social Sector Adjustment Loan to support structural reforms needed
in the social sectors. The project would assist Colombia in establishing a social protection system
that reacts quickly in response to economic crises and that is better targeted, more transparent and
properly evaluated. The project would also assist in the reform of labor regulations that have
hindered the employment of the poor, particularly young, female and self-employed workers.
A3l-Key Analytcal Work for PV02. To sunnort the pronosed nrogram the Bank is undertaking the
following analytical work:

*  Tlhe Colombia Poverty Report assesses and reviews (i) the evolution of poverty and inequality in
urban and rural areas over the past two decades; (ii) the incidence of crime and violence and
related household responses; and (iii) selected aspects of public assistance, including an overview
of public social expenditures and a specific review of the subsidized health insurance system.



Annex A
*  The Social Safety Net Assessment evaluates reforms to Colombia's social safety net, both for
addressing the needs of vulnerable groups during normal times and for developing a couriter-
cyclical strategy that could be implemented rapidly during future crises. The study (i) assesses
vulnerabilitv and risk management in Colombia: (ii) evaluates how the three new emergency Red
de Apoyo Social safety net programs fit into the broader social safety net over the long-term; (iii)
assesses the efficiencvy effectiveness and aans in Colombia's existing social assistance nrograms;
and (iv) proposes technical, program and policy reforms aimed at improving the social safety net.
Risks and Opportunities of the Proposed Program
A14.There are serious risks associated with the proposed program. If security conditions were to
significantly ude-riuratV, 1i..1plementation ui uic BariJk prugram wuuiu ob nuguuveiy uafetcu. In addition,
the current broad-based support for the: reform process could weaken, particularly during the upcoming
national elections. However, President Pastrana nas expressed nis commitneni to use the finai year of
his current administration to support the implementation of vital reforms. Moreover, the program has
been discussed with the main politicai parties (wnich would like to have paifuli but necessary reforms out
of the way before they take office), helping to increase its viability and continuity beyond this
administration. There are also several external risks that have been augmented by the events of September
11, namely a further deterioration in the terms of trade and closure of access to intenational markets.
However, the implementation of the fiscal reform program will mitigate these risks by sending positive
signals to the market that Colombia is committed to maintaining sound economic management.
Al 5.The risks of not proceeding with the program are even higher. First, the possibility of a deterioration
in the fiscal situation and growing fiscal deficits, jeopardizing macro-economic stability and growth
prospects, which could in tun lead to deepening political and social conflict in Colombia. Second, a
missed opportunity to alleviate the impact of economic crises on the most vulnerable citizens and to
ensure that key social services are targeted to the poor and delivered efficiently and effectively.
A16.Although this is a high-risk program, its returns could be substantial. Present political and economic
circumstances in Colombia, as well as recent performance of the Bank portfolio, do not warrant any
si'nificant denarture from the strategv outlined in the CAS and reaffirned in the CAS-PR. Indeed thev
confirm the need to focus urgent attention on several important aspects, such as promoting key social and
fiscal stnrutull reformns. Under these circumstances, it is management's view that there is no reason to
deviate from the high-case scenario for Bank lending at the rate of approximately $450 million per year.

Annex B
Externai Financing Requirements
In 2001, the government obtained its net deficit financing from both domestic and external sources.
Domestic financing accounted for 40 percent of net financing, -and external sources for about 60 percent.
In gross terms, Colombia successfully placed about US$5 billion in international bonds to cover its
privately provided financing for the year, including US$1 billion backed by a World Bank policy-based
guarantee operation. Of this amount, US$1.9 billion represent pre-financing for 2002. The remainder of
Colombia's gross financing needs, came from privatizations and multilateral institutions.
The government has a general strategy of decreasing its reliance on domestic financing, and this is
expected to be maintained over the coming years in order to decrease the crowding out of the private
sector and to set the stage for sustained investment and growth. Negative net domestic financing is
envisioned from 2002 onward, with limited recourse to privatization.
Projections of Colombia's external financing requirements and solute-es of finance are presentAd in Table
BI. Total public and private sector gross external financing requirements are estimated at US$7.2 billion,
UST7.8 billion, anti TR A hU. illinn %r 201, 2002 anA '2003 rpcvP,tivel.u  These x.-vfrnol f-5ncing
requirements are expected to be financed largely through public and private debt from both multilateral
and privtate souces, in cluding bond placemAents. Net capital in'lows are projected to ;ncrae slightly in
2002, as the public sector draws on its extemal portfolio built up in 2001. A positive net inflow of private

investment is initially projected at a level of about US$2 billion. A small accumulation of reserves is

Tne public sector will continue a strategy oI refinancing extemai puliic debt to improve its cost and
maturity structure if international market conditions allow. Maintaining adequate access to longer-term
financing as provided by the World Bank and other intemational financial organizations will continue to
be essential for improving the structure of Colombia's extemal public debt.

the authorities swapped US$2.4 billion of domestic debt due in 2001-05 with paper of longer maturity. As a
resl.t of this Swap the average matlrity of domestic debt increased firnm 3.5 to 4.5 yea r; proeted oAmestic
debt redemptions fell 22 percent in 2001, 34 percent in 2002, and 40 percent in 2003.

Strategy for Colombia
In s.it. of A.e reet e      and social .fi r_.,.uch7 of _az

two decades; infant mortality rates have been slashed by a factor of four in the last four decades; and
enrollmern in, basic education has increased. Tihese auvances, however, mask serious problems of
inequities, and poverty remains a critical problemn  The poverty gains reduction achieved in the early
l990s were unexpectedly reversed by the current crisis. Consequently, the rates of poverty and extreme
poverty in urban areas are currently about the same level as in the early 1990s, while in rural areas they
remain almost 10 percentage points higher than at the beginning of the 1990s. At the same time, there has
been a rising trend of inequality, which reduced the potential welfare gains of Colombians up to 1995 and
aggravated the welfare losses during the recession.
Sharp regional disparities in the quality of life continue to contribute to social disintegration.  For
example, poverty incidence is much higher in rural than in urban areas; infant mortality rates in Choc6 are
similar to the national average of more than twenty years ago; child malnutrition is 50 percent higher in
households in which the mother has no education; and vaccination rates, which declined significantly
during the last couple of years as a whole, are still much lower in households with head of household
without education. Furthermore, high and pervasive levels of violence, guerrilla warfare and narco-
trafficking have become critical barriers to improving living conditions and contribute to the displacement
of a large number of people mainly from the rural areas.
Education, health and social protection are key to improving economic competitiveness and growth,
reducing poverty and inequity in income distribution, and building a peaceful society. In this context,
Colombia is trying to develop human capital as an imnortant element towards further economic growth
and development. Among its priorities, the Government has focused on efforts to: (i) increase the quality
of basic edlcation and baSic health; (ii) im,nrnov thte effAniPiryv and Pnilitv nf rpennirn-es im.. in Milit-satinon
(iii) increase fairness of financial contribution and financial risk protection in health; and (iv) alleviate
the im.rn-t nf the cilrrnt ,'ricia on the meoat %nl1i.rah1e aonA Aoem.e^vt a h*flw nr soial nrnt.e n system.

issues
Tne country faces the following challenges and issues in the social sectors, inter alia:
7Colombia is currently experiencing one of the most difficult periods in its history, and it is just recovering
from one of the most severe economic crises in over 60 years. In 1999 economic activity declined 4.5 percent, and
the fiscal deficit surpassed 6 percent of GDP. All productive sectors have been affected and the living standard of
Colombians, especially the poor, has plummeted. This raises important issues for the social sectors.



Annex E
Education. Five distinct avenues of effort are proposed for Colombia: (a) continuing and intensifying the
focus on the poor to address inequalities: in access and completion at all levels, in particular at post-
secondary; (b) improving the quality and relevance of education at all levels; (c) supporting the financing,
governance, and management of education at the central and local levels through a rationalization and
deepening of the decentralization process under way, involving public-private partnerships; (d) increasing
higher education oDportunities. in Darticular for the underserved nonulations: and (e) building social
capital through education for peaceful coexistence.
Health. The Colombian health system needs to deal with the following five priority issues: (i) efficient
distriblution of available resontr-ces to achiev.e fill covevrag,e of the noor in the subsidi7ed rpahimne 5 - d to
effectively deliver basic health services and control of communicable diseases; (ii) elimination of evasion,

Social Protection. The main issues here are: (i) effective monitoring and evaluation of the Red de Apoyo
Social, wnich includes a workfare program (Empieo en Accion), a conditionai cask transfer program
(Familias en Acci6n); and a youth training program (Jovenes en Acci6n); (ii) lack of information on
coverage, efficiency and effectiveness of ali social assistance programs in Colombia; (iii) financing for
these programs in 2004 and beyond; (iv) existing programs' lack of a strategic focus; (v) lack of
flexibility to respond rapidly during a crisis and need for counter-cyclical financing; (vi) improvement of
poverty targeting; and (vii) poor budgetary data.
Social Sector Strategy in the Context of the Country Assistance Strategy
The last full CAS, discussed by the World Bank Board in November 1997, presented two main objectives
covering poverty reduction and sustainable growth, and specifying six strategic areas: (a) promoting
peace and development, (b) promoting rural development, (c) developing human capital, (d) attaining
public sector responsiveness and efficiency, (e) improving infrastructure services, and (f) ensuring
sustainable development. The basic obiectives and strategies of the CAS remain valid, although, in
reviewing the recent political, economic, and financial developments in the county and examining the
progress achieved since the CAS. a CAS Progress Report in November 1999 recommended certain
adjustments in the lending program. These changes in strategy were considered necessary because of the
need to resnond to several international economic crises; narticularlv the crisis in international credit
markets, and the sharp drop in oil and coffee prices that resulted in the deterioration of the general
economic conditions and the domestic financial sector in the coulntrv (these cnnditionq are still valid
today).
8 This would mrean the expansion of the subsidized regi,me by 6.2 million indivduals or 65 perent of the po-it;nfion
already affiliated to the subsidized regime
9This will accumulate, in 10 years, a net savings of US$2 billion -in 2000 dollars- equivalent to 3 percent of 2000's
GDP depending on the type of the reform
10This can provide, in 10 years, a fiscal savings varying between 1.2 to 2.4 percent of 2000's GDP, depending on

The CAS Progress Report took into consideration the many changes that had taken place both
internationally and domesticallyv and attempted to align Bank strateav and instmrnentq with the nriorities
of President Andres Pastrana's government. The CAS Progress Report confirmed the "basic objectives
and nvupra1l thiniet" nf the exyigtino C-AS in fnoiicin non nnvprty reAdiitiionn qns-inl diveAnnmrent  and
sustainable growth. However, the Progress Report proposed intensifying the assistance strategy to
include tw^o adjust.Ment opertions in responset t the need to cushion the adverse sc!nial impnact of the
economic recession on the poor and vulnerable groups. In this way, the report responded to the
dteri.tdv i aa condition LinZU1 t-16t-lt. in wi           .-A -+.-.ialI iLbO aila,   connlict -re aYUcf5ing
the poor and vulnerable groups particularly. The adjustments in assistance strategy also supported the

structural reforms supported by a formal IMF program, and in advancing the developmental aspects of the
peace process.
Ine oojectves outlineci m me i997 CAS ana its suDsequent updaTe in i999 were iuiiy consistent witheine
priorities articulated by the current Administration. The government prepared a four-year National
Development Plan outlining a national development strategy for 1998-2002. Areas covered are good
governance, social capital, peace and development, and macroeconomic growth and employment. The
emphasis on social capital is seen as key to resolving the internal conflict and violence in the country by
devolving power to the communities, improving access to basic goods and services, promoting universal
access to education and health services, ensuring gender equality, and achieving peace. As a means of
implementing the National Development Plan, the government has also developed a comprehensive
strategy, the Plan Colombia, in which various initiatives are presented to strengthen the peace process,
control drug traffic, and reactivate the economy. The CAS goals and priorities of expanding coverage and
improving the quality of basic education and basic health were reinforced by the CAS Progress Report.
The goals of the Bank's social sector strategy by sector in Colombia are:
Education:
(i) To bridge the considerable equity gaps that exist in access to education, including higher education,
while improving completion rates (these gaps affect the most vulnerable population groups, such as those
in the rural areas, the poor, the indigenous, the Afro-Colombians, and the displaced. Such ineauities are
widening because of the current economic, social, and security situation in the country);
(ii) To increase acces to nnstlitv of education in rnral and uirban schools by inroroting the exnannion of
proven cost-effective models;
(iii) To raise efficiency in the usee of resources by prormroting demand-side financinrg a an important
complement to purely supply-driven investment and improving the financing and management of
edua ,nni4   n it- n  ...oare reso.nci.,o  -loal needs and acco an  kle o ta  govennrah r.ce s.nlc-.ae  ot all

and implementation.
Health:
(i) To improve distriDution and use of available resources for health through tne exclusive use of the
funds of the Solidarity account of FOSYGA for the financing of the subsidized regime, as well as the
further transfonmation of supply to demand subsidies as defined by Law 715 (favoring demand subsidies
will provide strong incentives for hospitals and the ISS-Health to achieve greater efficiency and
competitiveness);
(ii) To restructure public hospitals, which are currently financed by historical budget-based subsidies
rather than sale of services;
(iii) To improve access to basic health delivery and control of public health threats;
(iv) To reform the Institute of Social Security (ISS);



Annex E
(v) To provide more effective information and education to the population to increase insurance coverage,
as well as access to health services"; and
(vi) To reduce evasion of health insurance contribution, which would have a positive effect for both the
contributory and the subsidized regimes. (Development of vieilance and control strategies with high
capacity to detect and punish evasion will add resources into the system and support the solidarity
nrincinle mandated by the health reform.  In narticular elimination of evasion wouild increase the
resources entering the Compensation Account by CCOP$1,881,000 million (US$767 million), equivalent
to 56 percent of the size of the Comnensation Acc.Ount in 2000 and exnmmd affihiAtinn to the su bsidi7ed
regime by 1.2 million individuals.)

program overlap and fragmentation) in close coordination with the institutions that formally deliver
public services like ministries, ICBF, eic.; and
(iv) To develop an integrated Social Risk Management System.
Implementation of the social sector programs has been limited in part because of the continued weakness
of the social sector ministries, including among others the high turnover at the ministerial level, complex
budgeting process, the inadequate operation of the national co-financing system, the lack of effective
monitoring and evaluation instruments, and complications from the decentralization process.
The Bank can play a catalytic role in bridging the gap between strategies and policies and
implementation. To do it, the Bank needs to redirect its efforts in the social sectors, mainly to facilitate
the decentralization process while ensuring the strengthening of social service delivery at the local level
within a sustainable fiscal framework. In the education sector the-Bank will continue supporting projects
both at the local and central levels to: (i) improve coverage and quality across all levels; (ii) identify
specific strategies for reaching vulnerable populations and ovening up opportunities for those who
traditionally have been excluded so that inequity will be reduced; (iii) improve the quality of life of the
youth; (iv) provide administrative tools for the implementing agencies, including MOE, to strengthen
their capacity; and (v) change some incentives in the system (for example, resources should follow
students and not teachers: sector information should be disseminated to the community as a whole). In
the health sector support should be provided to: (i) expand the coverage of health insurance among the
nonr- (iA rniih the transitinn from a qimniv to dernand cide finonnina of nihlir' henith fnrilities  (iii)
support autonomy of public health facilities; (iv) promote facilitation of private organization in the

implementation of communication and information campaigns will be an important element in guaranteeing the reform's success
as a means for individuals to understand both their rights and their obligations. Furthermore, the definition of rights and
obligations both for affiliates and the state will be further assisted by the approval of a Ley Estatutaria for the health sector.

provide temporary employment to the poor, unemployed and unskilled workers; and a family assistance
program for poor families (Familias en Acci6n) to give cash assistance to the poor on condition that they
keep their children in school and provide them with basic preventive health care. The medium-term
reform should focus on the development of a Social Risk Management System.
Vehicles for Bank Assistance
Lending services. To manage the risks in the sector the Bank needs to maintain flexibility in its
operations. Although lending will mainly include investment loans, programmatic lending will be
considered as an instrument in the social sectors, combining investment with adiustment loans to promote
needed structural reforms. To complete the set of operations in support of the social protection sector, the
terhninn tesns nf the nresientia! canitlates have reqne-ted technical cooneration in the form of
Technical Assistance (TA). A follow up TA for the SECAL will help to link the policies implemented
nder the present operation with actions to be taken dluing the next AdministrAtion. Tn e-Airtion the plan
is to continue with the Rural Education APL (Phase 2 in FY03) and support a new investment project to
improve equitY and quality in     erda          (FY03). l   -r      to deepen education
decentralization, the Bank will support a decentralized human capital development project (probably in

including development of a Social Risk Management System and promotion of decentralization. The
Youth Deveilpment LIL will also be expanded during FY03.
Non-lending Services. In addition to severai policy notes done in this FY on basic education, higher
education, social protection, health, and science and technology, sector work will be proposed on social
sector program efficiency and on hospital management and restructuring in FYO3. Tne Bank will
continue to support activities related to education and peace. In particular, in alliances with cother
partners, it will conduct two studies in this regard: one, to assess education models that improve tolerance,
democratic values and social cohesion; and the other, to evaluate the impact of the current conflict on the
delivery of education services.
With a combination of these services, the Bank will help the GOC improve access to quality social
services and reduce the disparities (mainly urban-rural) in standard of living. Progress benchmarks will
include indicators showing increases in: primary education in rural areas to about 75 percent by 2005; the
intake of students in six grade in rural areas; the probability that poor students have access to higher levels
of education; the coverage of the subsidized health care scheme for the poorest population; the number of
hosnitals converted into semi- or autonomous units (all by 2005); and the number of municipalities
certified to manage autonomously government financial transfers. Finally, it is expected that the
efficiency of programs like the National Training Service (SENA) and the Colombian Institute for Family
Welfare (ICBF) will be monitored regularly.



Annex F
The Consultation Process in Colombia and Actions Related to the Adjustment Loan
This annex provides an overview of the consultation process that the Bank has promoted in Colombia.
with a particular reference to social sector policy. Colombia has a rich array of civil society organizations
and private sector associations involved in the crafting and imnlementation of social nolicv. In many
cases these groups have assumed a social service delivery role as important of equal - and in some cases
greater - imnortance than the Rtate BRevynd thece non-government nroAni7atinnq the RRnkl heo a1Ro

i) Participatory Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) process
The most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was prepared using a new, participatory approach
being piloted in the World Bank which included extensive consultations with civil society and workshops
in Bogota with government and civil society representatives. The process used to develop the CAS
resulted not only in a shared assessment of the actions required to meet Colombia's development needs,
but also a strengthened relationship between;government, civil society and the World Bank.
The consultations carried out in the preparation of the CAS concentrated mostly on diagnosing areas of
needed action, which was used to develop six strategic areas in the CAS. This proposed SECAL responds
directly to three of the six strategic areas identified during this consultation process: (i) promoting peace
and development; (ii) developing human capital; and (iii) attaining public sector responsiveness and
efficiency. Furthermore, it does so by promoting reforms in the areas identified by the Government, the
Bank and civil society as being particularly imnortant and challenging, namely implementation and
institutional change.
In promoting peace and development, the process used to develop the proposed SECAL as well as several

4) Elements of the SECAL supporting a continued consultation process
Several initiatives in the SECAL support a continued consultation process with civil society, building
transparency and accountability in the public sector, including:
*  The establishment of a public momtoring system based on regular, ongoing consultations with
civil society on public sector performance in the social sectors.
*  A pilot for increasing citizens' 'oversight of ICBF, the largest social assistance program in
Colombia.
* Internet dissemination on the performance of health services providers
* M    II..poe  quality and6 avai"labliy of pJublic% JLVLInfrLt"ion on- s.L-u,dentL MAievernent results ardu
promising pedagogical models.
Taken as a whole, the actions and elements reviewed above have provided a solid foundation for dialogue
regarding the main policy issues addresed by ihe SECAL and will serve to strengthen an ongoing
dialogue, particularly between the state ana civil society, on key social sector issues. The SECAL team
will look to continue te uiaiogue as the reforms are impiemented, particularly after the ioan is effective
to ensure the future sustainability of the social sector reforms promoted by the SECAL.
