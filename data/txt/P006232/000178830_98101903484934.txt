APPRAISAL OF THE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
COMPANHIA PAULISTA DE FORCA E LUZ (CPFL) /
SUMMARY
1         Companhla Paulista de Forca e Luz (CPFL) has applied to the
Bank for a loan of US$41 million equivalent to help finance the rehabili-
tation and expansion of its transmission and distribution system, ex-
cluding interest during construction. The project is estimated to cost
US$93 7 million equivalent.
ii.       The project consists of the rehabilitation and expansion of
the transmission and distribution system for the three-year period 1966-
68 2/ Rehabilitation of the present system represents about 20 percent
of the total cost   The remaining costs are allocated to the construction
of nime 138 kv transmission lines and line extensions totalling 560 km of
circuit, six 66 kv circuits totalling 150 km, substations totalling
215,000 kva capacity, and expansion of the distribution system.
il       OCPFL is one of ten companies acquired from the American &
Foreign Power Company (AMFORP) in 1964 by Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras
(Eletrobras), an autonomous agency of the Brazilian Government   Eletrobras
has retained the same management arrangements that were in effect under
ANPFORP's ownershlp CPFL's operations are satisfactormly managed and it
should be capable of supervising construction of the project.
Iv.       The proceeds of the loan would be used mainly to finance the
cost of equipment, materials and supplies procured under international
competitive bidding, and the foreign currency cost of engineering services
Awards would be made after international competitive bidding with par-
ticipation by qualified domestic suppliers who would be granted a 15 per-
cent preference   Satisfactory arrangements have been made for Eletrobras
to provide the balance of funds required to finance CPFL's program
v.        New Federal decrees issued late in 1964 allowed for the first
time the periodic revaluation of assets for tariff-making purposes
Tariffs were increased in 1965, and in June and November 1966, following
the revaluatlon of assets   Arrangements have been made in connection
with the proposed loan to ensure that satisfactory tariffs will be ob-
tained in the future by CPFL.
vi        The project is sultable for a Bank loan of US$h1 million equiva-
lent for a term of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years

BRAZIL
APPRAISAL OF THE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
COMPANHIA PAULISTA DE FORCA E LUZ (CPFL) -
I. INTRODUCTION
1         Centrals Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobras) an autonomous
agency of the Federal Government, purchased ten electric utility companies
in Brazil from the American & Foreign Power Company (AMFORP) in November
1964. The systems were then in urgent need of rehabilitation and expansion
and a five-year program covering the period 1966-70 was prepared in order
to supply existing and prospective demand   In response to the request of
Eletrobras the Bank has agreed to consider loans aggregating the equival-
ent of approximately US$60 million to assist financing of the expansion
program over a period constituting three years of the five-year expansion
program   In accordance with the Bank's preference to lend directly to the
operating entity carrying out the project it is proposed to make separate
loans to four of the largest of the companies, located in the south central
region where Bank-financed power generation projects are concentrated.
2.        This appraisal report covers the proposed loan of the equivalent
of US$h1 million to one of the four companies, Cia. Paulista de Forca e
Luz (CPFL), which operates in the State of Sao Paulo. The proposed loan
would provide funds for about 44 percent of the estimated cost of US$93 7
mallion equivalent of the expansion program of the company for the three-
year period 1966-68 and would represent about 35 percent of the estimated
cost of the five-year program   About two-thirds of the proposed loan
would be expended on the distribution system and the remainder on the
high voltage system. Interest during construction would not be included
in the loan since the project consists predominantly of distribution
facilities which would become revenue bearing shortly after installation.
CPFL and the other three companies to which proposed loans would be made
have not been the recipients of previous loans from the Bank
1/ This report is one of four essentially similar appraisal reports
covering proposed Bank loans to four distribution companies in Brazil
The companies are under common ownership and as a result a consider-
able amount of the text is common to each report. Paragraphs and
Annexes which are identical or substantially similar have been ident-
ified with an asterisk (*) throughout the four reports, which are sub-
mitted as a group



- 2 -
*  3.        This report is based on the findings of the mission to Brazil
in November-December 1965, composed of Messrs. D. King and F Rydell of
the Bank   A long delay was experienced subsequently in negotiating
several issues with the Government of Brazil and the loan is only now
submitted to the Executive Directors for this reason    The long interval
which has elapsed has to some extent outdated the report, which is based
on the expansion program for the three year period 1966-68. The complete
recasting of the program at this stage would result in considerable
further delay in presenting the loan and to avoid this the appraisal is
presented substantially as prepared on the basis of the mission's original
findings. It is considered that this is justified by the circumstances
4 4.         The project, as described hereafter, consists predominantly
of a distribution system expansion, the implementation of which is some-
what flexible in that retardation of the program over a period can, up
to a point, be compensated by a subsequent acceleration    As noted in
paragraph 33, a review must be made each year of the program proposed
for the next year as a condition of disbursement and proper application
of the loan funds will be assured in any event    The financial statements
are outdated for similar reasons but there has been no adverse change in
the financial condition of CPFL and the statements are therefore con-
sidered to be a fair representation of the present and future financial
position of the company
II. HOLDING COMPANY ORGANIZATION
*  5.        Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobras), the owner
of CPFL, is an autonomous agency established by the Federal Government
in 1961 to carry out studies and to finance, construct and operate elec-
tric power works. It is a holding company which controls the operation
of the federal utilities. It administers public funds to expand the
federal power systems, assist with the expansion of other electric util-
ities in need of financing, and finance power facilities in underdeveloped
areas. Eletrobras commenced operations in June 1962 and has become the
most important single force in the development of the electric utility
industry.  Additional information concerning Eletrobras is given in
Annex 1.
*  6.        On November 12, 1964 an agreement was concluded between
Eletrobras and AMFORP whereby the Brazilian properties of the latter were
acquired by Eletrobras In summary, for US$135 million Eletrobras pur-
chased from AMFORP the controlling stock and the short-term notes, amount-
ing to US$64 million, of the ten companies, becoming the majority share-
holder of each company. Payment is to be made over a period of 45 years.



- 3 -
h 7.         Prior to the acquisition of the compamnes by Eletrobras their
operating control in Brazil had been exercised by Companhia Auxiliar de
Empresas Eletrmcas Brasileiras (CAEEB), a management company established
in 1957 by AMFORP. Eletrobras, which acquired control of CAEEB when it
purchased the companies, has retained this arrangement. CAEEB maintains
its headquarters Ln Rio de Janeiro where it employs a staff of 250  The
administration department supervises the operations of the associated
companies, provides procurement services for foreign purchases and sets
labor and wage policy. The engineering department supervises planning
and the capital budgets of the companies, prepares specifications, sets
technical standards and orients other phases of the operations from a
technical standpoint. The finance department supervises the accounting
actv-ities of the companies, negotiates loans, makes rate studies and
prepares rate applications and supervises the operating budgets
*  8.        The organizational structure of CAEEB, instituted by AMFORP,
has remained mntact   However, it is understaffed as a result of the
conditions described in paragraph 15  With the planned increase in
staff to meet normal requirements, the organization should be fully
competent to provide effective management supervision of the companies.
It would find it difficult, however, to coordmnate and direct the pro-
posed expansion program in addition to supervising the operation of the
companies, and it therefore plans to make extensive use of the services
of consultants in this connection, as noted in paragraph 35.
III. THE BORROWER
9.        CPFL is much the largest of the former AMFORP companies, serving
a zone 400 kilometers from north to south and the same distance east to
west, in the central and northern parts of the State of Sao Paulo, as
shown on the map. It is the third largest distribution company in Brazil
supplying about 4 million people, including six cities between 50,000
and 200,000 and seven between 20,000 and 50,000   Over half the popula-
tion served is located in urban areas. In 1965 the demand was 405 MW
and energy sales ),762 million kwh.
10.       The canpaLny owns generating stations with an aggregate capacity
of 298 MW, of which 268 MW is hydroelectric and 30 MW thermal. The
Peixoto hydroelectric plant with a capacity of 180 MW is the largest.
The company is at present installing six additional generators aggregating
300,000 kw capacity in Peixoto, with the assistance of a loan from the
U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). CPFL purchases a small
amount of energy from Companhia Hidroeletrica de Rio Pardo (CHERP), a
state-owned company in the State of Sao Paulo



- 4 -
11        The company operates a 132 kv transmission system totalling
780 km of circuit, on the eastern side of the service area, over which
is transmitted the power generated at the Peixoto station. It has a
66 kv subtransmission system totalling 1,430 km, and 900 km of 33 kv
subtransmission.
12        At present CPFL has approximately 2,300 km of primary dlstri-
bution circuit, 4,400 km of secondary dlstribution circuit and 225 MVA
of dlstribution transformer capacity. Power is stepped down to the primary
distribution voltages of 13 2 and 11 4 kv   Some rural circuits operating
at 6 6 kv are to be progressively converted to these voltage levels.
Power is distributed over 127/220 volt secondary networks. The dlstri-
bution systems are of the overhead type.
13.       CPFL was established in 1912.  Approximately 75 percent of
the common stock is owned by Eletrobras, with the remaining 25 percent
held by the public   It is administered by a five-man Board of Directors
elected for a term of three years   The present Board took office in
March 1965 and all of the memibers have had long service with the company
or CAEEB, including the president of CAEEB who serves as a member    The
company is managed by an Executive Director, who is a member of the Board
Major policies are set by CAEEB but the management of the company is
responsible for the day to day administration.
14        CPFL employs a total staff of 2,300, including 1,700 in the
four field operating divisions of the service area, 280 in the accounting
division, 90 engineers in the engineering division and 70 in the purchas-
ing division. The CPFL organizational structure, instituted by AMFORP,
is satisfactory.
k 15        Prior to their acquisition by Eletrobras, the AMFORP companies
were in difficult financial straits due to the Government policy toward
investor-owned utilities. This resulted in the companies' inability to
obtain rate increases during the recent period of rapid inflation    The
maintenance and expansion programs of the companies were severely limited
by the shortage of funds. In addition, a considerable number of the
staff left their employ and there is now a shortage, particularly engi-
neering and supervisory, in the companies    During the next two years
CPFL plans to increase its staff by about a total of 350, including engi-
neers and technicians   In view of the scale of utility expansion in
Brazil, however, some difficulty may be experienced in obtaimnng a suf-
ficient number of engineers.
* 16.       In the past, major substation and transmission engineering was
carried out by CAEEB. Distribution planning was carried out by the CPFL
engineering staff according to standards established by CAEEB    These
arrangements will continue although due to staff shortages it will be
necessary to employ consulting engineers to assist with much of the design



- 5 -
work during the expansion program (paragraph 35)    The policy of the
company is to employ contractors for construction work
w 17.       Due to lack of funds, expansion of the powzer system facilities
necessary to satisfactorily supply the increasing load has not been pos-
sible in recent years and the reserve capacity which normally would be
maintaimed in accordance with sound utility practice has been utilized
to meet the increasing load. When the reserve capacity was fully em-
ployed, equipment was then overloaded in order to meet further growth.
This has resulted in unsatisfactory operating conditions including low
voltage and service interruptions
18.       The shortage of funds also forced the company to limit main-
tenance. As the result of this and the abnormal operating conditions
the useful life of some distribution equipment, particularly transformers,
may have been shortened   Replacement of a considerable number of trans-
formers which have become overloaded or obsolete would be necessary as
part of the expansion program.
IV    THE POWER MARKET
19        Adequate records have been kept by CPFL, concerning power sales
which in 1965 amounted to 1,762 million kwh, with a peak demand of 405
Ml   Residential service accounted for 20 percent, commercial 10 percent,
industrial 32 percent, public service and lighting 13 percent and miscel-
laneous, including sales to other utilities, 25 percent of total sales
The rate of groith hasbeen about 11 percent annually during the past ten
years
20.       Some of the most productive parts of Brazil lie iithin the
service area of the company   In it there are many large industries,
particularly in the city of Campinas, and important agricultural areas,
producing coffee and other products. The close proximity of the service
area to the major population concentration of the country, in which the
bulk of the country's wealth resides, has been the most Important reason
for the substantial growth rate of the company   At the end of 1964,
CPFL had about 400,000 customers with an average yearly consumption of
4,200 kwh per customer
21.       The power market has been studied by the company's consultants,
Cia Internacional de Engenharia e Construcoes (CIECO), a Brazilian
affiliate of the International Engineering Company of San Francisco    It
is estimated that by 1970 the number of customers would increase to
550,000 with an average annual consumption per customer of about 5,600
kwh, and total annual sales of 3,080 mllUion kwh, representing an
annual growth of about 11 percent. The forecast of demand is considered
reasonable.



- 6 -
22        The company purchased less than 2 percent of power requirements
in 1964.  Purchases of power would increase, however, to about 30 percent
of total requirements by 1967   The completion of the extension to the
Peixoto generating station about the end of 1967 should make it unneces-
sary to purchase powfer in 1968-9, but it would likely be necessary to
resume purchases in 1970.
23        At present, the company purchases power from Companhia Hidro-
eletrica de Rio Pardo (CHERP) which would continue to supply part of
the requirements in 1966-7   The remainder would be purchased from Usinas
Eletricas do Paranapanema (USELPA)   The CPFL system will be intercon-
nected in 1967 with that of Furnas, a subsidiary of Eletrobras and one
of the major generating entities in the South Central region, which it
is envisaged would supply the bulk of the requirements of CPFL for pur-
chased power   Annex 2 tabulates the past record and forecast of genera-
tion, purchases and sales for the periods 1961-5 and 1966-70, respectively.
24        Power system losses, as a percent of total generation plus
purchased power, have varied somewhat over recent years, reflecting a
number of factors   The estimate of losses (Annex 2) envisages a gradual
reduction of losses as the expansion program progresses   For the pur-
pose of estimating expenses on a conservative basis, it has been assumed
that losses would still approximate almost 15 percent by 1970   However,
as set forth in the consultant's report, substantially lower losses
would be achieved by that time if the expansion program is carried out as
planned.
V    THE PROJECT
25        The project comprises the rehabilitation and expansion of the
transmission and distribution system during the three year period 1966-
68   About 20 percent of the expenditure would be required to rehabilitate
the existing system and increase its capacity to satisfactorily supply
the present load   The remainder would provide for expansion of the
system commensurate with the increase in load anticipated for the three
year period. The high voltage portion would entail the construction of
nine 138 kv transmission lines and a number of extensions totalling 560
km of circuit, and six short 66 kv circuits totalling 150 km in length.
26        The project would include the installation of one 25 MVA
138/66 kv substation and nine 138 kv 15 MVA substations employing three-
phase dual ratio 138/13 8-11 6 kv transformers, five of which would
supply 13 8 kv primary feeder busses and the remainder 11.6 kv busses.
In addition, seven 5 MVA 66/13 8 kv substations, and ten 2 MVA substations,
of the same voltage rating, woula be installed. New 138 kv and 69 kv
substation capacity would aggregate about 215 MVA
27        At the primary distribution levels of 13.8 and 11.6 kv, the
work would comprise the installation of additional primary feeders and
the rebuilding of many of the existing feeders at nearly 400 locations
The existing 6 6 kv distribution circuits in rural areas would be con-
verted to the standard distribution primary voltage   For the spconh3rr



- 7 -
networks operating at 127/220 volts the program would provide for the
connection and supply of about 95,000 new customers, the installation
of additional distribution transformer capacity and the reinforcement
of many secondary network feeders to relieve overload on existing facili-
ties.  The program would involve the installation of about 200,000 kva
of distribution transformers, associated switchgear and ancillary equip-
ment, including the installation of about 120,000 meters.

* 29        The proposed loan amount would be used to finance equipment,
materials and supplies procured under international competitive bidding,
including domestic suppliers, and the foreign currency cost of engineering
services   It would not be used to finance the cost of labor, of wood
and concrete supports, of a large amount of hardware and of such materials
as cement, which would not reasonably be obtained outside Brazil, and
which, therefore, would not be procured under international bidding
30        Brazil produces most of the items of equipment and materials
to be financed by the proposed loan.  It is difficult to assess the
competitive position of Brazilian industry and to estimate the proportion
of the Bank financed goods which might be purchased in Brazil. However,
from the information which is avallaole 50 percent of the loan might be
used for local purchases
P_ .
> 31        The cost estimates were prepared by CIECO and CPFL assisted by
an experienced Brazilian engineering firm   CIECO, with the assistance
of the International Engineering Company assigned prices on the basis of
information available concerning international pricing of the equipment
and materials   These same prices were used in computing the cost of the
programs of the other three companies to which it is proposed to make
loans, thus assuring uniformity. A contingency allowance of approximately



- 8 -
12 percent has been included for the Bank financed component of the pro-
ject. This is to provide for some increase in the cost of equipment and
materials which would be subject to increase as the result of changes,
particularly copper   In addition, it is intended to make allowance for
increases in costs which in some cases may result to the borrower from
the purchase of Brazilian goods under the 15 percent preference formula
described in paragraph 36.
32        The local currency cost estimate was prepared in USQ equivalent,
as is customary in Brazil, where the rate of inflation has been high, to
provide a reasonably firm basis for comparlson with actual costs as they
are incurred   Increased local costs due to inflation are expected to be
offset by periodic tariff adjustments permitted by law
s  33        The total estimated cost wqas prepared by extending to all the
areas covered by this program the detailed cost estimates made for
typical installations and areas. In view of the method it would be
necessary for the company to make detailed studies of the system expan-
sion and prepare detailed cost estimates each year as the program pro-
gresses   It has been agreed that these studies and estimates in respect
of the program for a particular year would be submitted in a form satis-
factory to the Bank as a condlition of further disbursement in respect to
goods purchased during that year
34        The expansion of the distribution system would be continued
after 1968   Provision has been made in the Estimated Source and Appli-
cation of Funds, 1966-70 (Annex 5) for this, for the Pelxoto project
(paragraph 10), and for other capital improvements, including buildings
and tr,,nsportation equipment
VI.   STATUS OF ENGINEERING AND CONSTRdJCTION
35        As noted in paragraph 31, CIECO supervised the preparation of
the cost estimates and would generally supervise and coordinate the pro-
ject Detailed planning, and design of the transmission and large sub-
station work would be undertaken by CIECO and CAEEB   Distribution plan-
ning and design would be undertaken by CPFL and by a local experienced
Brazilian engineering firm   Supervision of construction would be pro-
vided by CPFL   Virtually all construction, both transmission and distri-
bution, will be carried out by experienced Brazilian construction firms.
Assurances nlave been received that CAEEB and CPFL would continue to em-
ploy consulting engineering firms satisfactory to the Bank
VII    PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENTS
36        As noted previously, the equipment and materials which would
be financed by the proposed Bank loan (paragraph 29) would be purchased
under international competitive bidding, including Brazilian supplLers
The method of comparing foreign and domestic bids, which follows that
agreed between the Government and Bank in connect3on with prevous power
loans, is quoted in part as follows

"The Borrower intends to invite firms producing goods Ln Brazil to
participate in the international competitive bidding. In the case
of goods produced in Brazil the Borrower may award the order to the
lowest Brazilian bidder offering satisfactory terms and conditions,
provided that his offered price does not exceed the offered price
of the lowest acceptable foreign bidder by more than 15 percent.
Comparlson of bids will be made without takimng into account customs
or other similar duties.  For flirrs in Brazil, the delivery price
will comprise the F.O.B. plant cost plus freight, insurance and
other delivery costs to Campinas. For non-Brazilian firms, the
delivery price will be based on the C.I.F. landed cost, port of
entry, before customs duties, plus inland freight, insurance and
other delivery costs to Campinas. For reasons of economy, orders
may be placed jointly on behalf of the Borrower and any of the
other three companies which are the recipient of Bank loans. In
such cases comparison of bids will take into account the fact that
part of the order will be delivered at Campinas. and the other
part or parts at the delivery place provided for each of the other
companies. As the 15 percent preference allowed firms in Brazil
is in lieu of customs duties, the 15 percent will be added to the
C.I.F. landed cost (excluding customs duties) of the non-Brazilian
goods, before inland freight, insurance and other costs. In the
case of bids composed of both cruzeiros and foreign currency the
cruzeiro portion thereof wlll be dealt with as a Brazilian bid
and the foreign exchange portion as a non-Brazilian bid.
"For comparison purposes all bids after evaluation will be converted
into cruzeiros at the Bid Comparison Rate of Exchange  The Bid
Comparison Rate of Exchange is understood to be the dollar selling
rate of the Banco Central da Republica do Brasil plus the exchange
surtax (but not to exceed 30 percent), if any, prevailing at the
date on which bids are closed. It is further understood that the
Bank will., on its own initiative, or at the request of the Borrower
or Guarantor, reconsider and, if necessary, revise the Bid Com-
parison Rate of :xchange, whenever there should be a substantial
change in the Brazilian exchange system which would, in the judgment
of the Bank, render such rate unsuitable for bid comparison purposes
"The Guarantor will take all such measures as shall be necessary in
order to facilitate the importation, free from all legal and admini-
strative limitations or restrictions, of goods purchased outside
Brazil in accordance with the provisions hereof and of the Loan
Agreement."
In the latter part of 1965 the Government eliminated the exchange surtax
and established a new Banco Central buying rate of Cr$2220 = US$1  At
the present time, therefore, local and foreign bids would be compared as
described in detail above using a bid comparison rate of exchange of
approximately Cr$2220 = US$1 and allowing a 15 percent preference for
local bidders.

37        CIECO would prepare specifications and evaluate bids and
would provide overall coordination of procurement services for both
foreign and locally purchased goods to assure that the timing and
quantities of goods purchased would be in accordance iath construction
progress. CAEEB would provide purchasing services for the procurement
of goods obtained with Bank funds. CPFL would be responsible for pro-
curement of local goods.
*  38.       Under this arrangement CPFL's Bank financed goods would be
grouped with those of the other three companies which are the recipients
of proposed Bank loans, so that in most instances a single order would
be placed to obtain the price advantage of larger orders. However, in-
voicing and delivery would be made directly to the respective companies
in accordance with the allotments specified

VIII   FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Tariffs
i 39        The regulations governing power operations and tariffs are con-
tained in the Water Code of 1934 and subsequent amendments and decrees,
including in particular a decree dated February 26, 1957, and three
decrees dated November 4, 1964   Prior to 1964, tariffs were based on the
use of historic values of investment and became increasingly unrealistic
as inflation developed, causing many utilities to incur operating losses
for several consecutive years   The 1964 decrees reflected a major change
in Government policies by allowing utilities to revalue their investment,
and thus maling it possible for utilities to apply for tariffs which would
yield adequate returns
* 40        Under the existing regulations, tariffs are reviewed and approved
by the Waters Division every three years or at shorter intervals, at the
initiative of the Waters Division or the utility   Utilities are permitted
to apply for tariffs which would yield revenues covering (a) operating costa,
(b) straight-line depreciation of gross fixed assets in operation, exclud-
ing lana and land rights, at annual rates of up to 8 percent for thermal
plants and up to 5 percent for all other facilities including hydro plants,
but with no minimum in either case, (c) a reversion provision of up to 3
percent, or an amortization provision of up to 5 percent, on the total
gross fixed assets in operation, also without minima, and (d) a return of
10 percent on the remunerable investment   Remunerable investment is
defined as gross plant in service (excluding assets acquired through con-
tributions in aid of construction) less depreciation and reversion or
amortization reserves, plus reversion or amortization funds and an allowance
for working capital consisting of operating inventories, the equivalent of
two months billing, and cash (up to the value of the reserve for depreciation
balance) excluding cash representing contributions in aid of construction
Shortfalls in achieving the return of 10 percent in the three-year tariff
period may be recovered, in principle, in the subsequent three-year period
Another provision in the regulations, however, permits tariff adjustments
for recovering shortfalls to be made at more frequent intervals
s 41        Between tariff revisions, the following surcharges may be added
by the utilities on their current tariffs without permission of the Waters
Division   (a) monthly, for compulsory increases in wages, social benefits,
cost of fuel and purchased power, and (b) semi-annually, for increases in
foreign debt service due zo changes in the foreign exchange rate
S 42        Tariff adjustments for the revaluation of the balance sheets
accounts can be made as often as economic correction factors (coefficients),
shouing the variations in the purchasing power of the currency, are pub-
lished by the National Economic Council    The coefficients are issued
annually about two months after the end of each year for the use of industr,
in general   They are applied by utilities to up-date the values of plant
in service, depreciation and amortization or reversion reserves, and certa:n

local currency loans from the Ilational Development Bank and/or Eletrobras
Foreign currency components of the book value of fixed assets are converted
into local currency at the rate of exchange in effect at the time the assets
are acquired   Foreign debts are revalued on the basis of the current rate
of exchange   The amount by which the revaluation of fixed assets exceeds
the revaluation of reserves and loans is set aside as a revaluation reserve
which is subject to a 5 percent tax
i 43        In addition to the tariffs, two surcharges are being levied on the
consumer's electric bill by the Federal Government to help finance power
expansion in the country   In the case of the distribution companies
reviewed in connection with appraisals for Bank loans, the combination of
these surcharges have amounted to between 40 percent and 50 percent of the
average tariff ir 1965   The proceeds of one of these surcharges, the "sole"
tax which was created in 1954, are allocated among the Federal, State ard
Mqlunicipal authorities This tax, the rate of which varies according to class&s
of consumers, is presently based on an average price per kwh computed peri-
odically by the Hational Council of lWater and Electric Energy  Another
surcharge, similarly computed and assessed, is the "compulsory loan", intro-
duced in NJovewlber 1962 and which is to terminate in 1968  The proceeds go
to Fletrobras which in turn invests such funds in various power projects in
the form of loans or share capital   Dletrobras issues to the consumers, for
the amount of the "compulsory loans' paid, debt certificates carrying an
interest rate of 12 percent and redeemable in 10 years   A third surcharge,
which is a social security tax, is 8 percent of the tariff
* 44        The implementation of the revaluation provision was not entirely
satisfactory during the initial year, 1965, due not only to the understand-
able complexities involved with the transition, but also to the permissive
character of several important provisions of the new regulations    Revalu-
ation was not then compulsory, the legislation provided for maximum rates of
depreciation and amortization but no minimum rates were prescribed and
recovery of shortfalls in earnings at intervals and for periods shorter than
three years was only optional   In addition, there was uncertainty among
utilities in regard to interpretation of certain provisions of the regula-
tions and long delays were experienced in a number of instances before
tariffs were actually adjusted to reflect revaluation of assets
45        The Bank was particularly concerned with two possible consequences
of the permissive character of the regulations   Different tariff policies
could be followed whilch in the case of interconnected utilities, might well
lead to conflicting principles being used in calculating the apparent cost
of inportant blocks of power and could result in important economic decisions
being based on erroneous assumptions   lhile efforts were being made by
30vernment to implement sound and, in certain instances, relatively high
tariffs, there existed the possibility that, in compliance with the same
regulations, utilities might be allowed to revert in the future to inadequate
tariff levels
46        These questions were brought to the attention of the Government
early in 1966   It was suggested that regulations should be tightened to
eisure that a minimum and uniform level of tariff perfo..mance be recu':ed



- 13 -
prom all utilities in the future. The Government Lndicated that it was
aware of this problem and was planning to continue improving the implementa-
tion of the regulations. It was not prepared at the time to propose correct
ing legislation to Congress. Pending such legislation, however, it was
suggested that the Bank should define in a more detailed and specific rate
covenant than those in the agreements for earlier power loans, the minimum
level of financial performance it expected utilities to achieve, and that
the Government would support extension of this type of rate covenant to as
many other utilities as possible, through Eletrobras.
* 47.       During the negotiations for the four Distribution Loans, however,
the representatives of the Brazilian Government objected that the detailed
covenants proposed might conflict with Brazllan law. Pending clarification
of this point, negotiations were suspended. Conversations continued and
the Government informed the Bank recently that legislation had been enacted
by Congress which will   (1) make the revaluation of utilities' assets com-
pulsory, a measure which alleviates much of the Bank's concern, (2) reduce by
one half the level of electrification taxes and (3) extend the surcharge
on compulsory loans to 1973, provide for their annual revaluation, interest
at 6 percent and a 20 year term.
* 48.       Negotiations between the Government and the Bank over the question
of tariffs finally resulted in the following
(1) The Government, CPFL and the other Distribution Companies agreed
to a covenant under which (a) as provided by the Brazilian legis-
lation, tariffs will be set so as to produce revenues at a level
consistent with sound financial and public utility practices,
using straight-line depreciation which shall be not less than that
based on the useful lives of depreciable assets in operation, and
(b) as permitted by the Brazllian legislation, assets will be re-
valued and tariffs will be correspondingly adjusted at least once
every calendar year.
(2) A change in legislation which shall adversely affect the setting
of tariffs at the level stated above, shall be an event of default.
(3) In a letter to CPFL and the other Distribution Companies the Bank
will define the standard which it would use to analyse a change in
legislation for the purpose of (2) above. This standard shall be
whether revenues from the sale of electricity are sufficient to
(a) cover all of the Borrower's operating expenses, including
straight-lime depreciation of gross revalued fixed assets in opera-
tion, at rates based on the useful lives of assets and (b) produce
a reasonable annual rate of return on the revalued average net
fixed assets in operation (which under presently foreseeable con-
ditions would be of the order of 10%).
i 49.       In the course of 1966, the assets of CPFL have been revalued
twice, to reflect the official cost indices at December 31, 1964 and 1965.
Corresponding tariff adjustments were made in June and November. The tarLffM



- 14 -
introduced in June were calculated to provide inter alia for depreciatior
charges at 5 percent, reversion charges at 3 percent and a 10 percent retu-rn
on the remunerable investment   Details of the November adjustment are not
yet available
Financial Position
* 50        CPFL's financial statements for 1965 were audited by Boucinhas &
Compos, Certified Public Accountants   The accounting methods followed and
the auditing arrangements are satisfactory   In connection with the proposea
loan, CPFL should agree to continue to employ auditors satisfactory to the
Bank and to submit certified annual financial statements with the auditor's
report
* 51        The estimated financial position of CPFL as of December 31, 1965
is presented in the following statement and in Annex 6   Two balance sheets
have been shown in the following statement to indicate the effect of the
revaluation wqhich will be recorded in 1966 The first balance sheet reflects
the value of the assets, capital and liabilities based on the revaluation
made in April 1965, which applied the 1964 coefficient   The second balance
sheet shows the result of revaluation based on the 1965 coefficient of 1 27

52        CPFL's revaluation of April 1965, increased net plant in service
by Cr$66,279 million   The estimated revaluation that will be recorded in
1966, based on the 1965 coefficient, will increase the net plant in opera-
tion by aoout Cr$42,000 million to a total value of Cr$200,062 million at
December 31, 1965
53        Estimated share capital outstanding at December 31, 1965 is
Cr$59,640 nillion   After CPFL revalues its accounts based on the 1965 co-
efficient, the revaluation reserve will be increased to Cr$40,926 million
Ir accoz dance with current regulations this reserve must be disposed of by
an equivalent stock distribution   Thus in 1966 the share capital will be
increased from Cr$59,640 million to about Cr$100,566 million before taking
into account new equity investments
54        The first Export/Import Bank loan amounting to US$29 9 million
was made in 1953 to finance two 14 a1W generating units for the Carloba stemn
station, one 10 MW generating unit in the Americana hydroelectric plant,
construction of the Pelxoto Dam including the installation of two 40 4W
generating units, and expansion of the transmission and distribution system4
This loan was signed in 1953, carries a 414 percent interest rate, and is
being amortized over a 25 year period   The second Export/Import Bank loan
amounting to US$6 3 million was made in 1959 to assist in financing the
third and fourth generating units in the Pelxoto Hydroelectric Station and
further expansion ot the transmission and distribution system   This second
loan was signed in 1959, carries a 5½2 percent interest rate, and is being
amortlized over a 20 year period  CPFL revalued these loans in accordance
witn the rates of exchange prevailing in 1963 and 1964    In April 1965, they
were again revalued based on the rate of exchange of Cr$1,850 to US$1 and
this value is reflected in the first balance sheet above    In November 1965
the rate of exchange was increased to Cr$2,220 to US$1 at which rate the
values of the Export/Import Bank loans outstanding at December 31, 1965 are
shown in the second statement above   The Export/Import Bank loans were
originally made to CPFL and the guarantor was the Brazilian Electric Power
Company (BEPCO), a wholly owned subsidiary of A1iFORP  On March 18, 1965,
an agreement was executed between the Export/Import Bank and the Brazilian
Government, whereby new notes were ecehanged for the notes issued under the
original loan agreement and the guarantor was changed from BEPCO to the
Brazilian Government
55        Under the Alliance for Progress Program, a loan amounting to
USt20 4 million equivalent was made in November 1964 by US AID to Eletrobrssr
Terms of this loan were 5-1/2 percent interest with an amortization period
of thirty-five equal semi-annual payments commencing 2-1/2 years after the
first interest payment   The first interest payment was made in November
1965   Originally funds from this loan were to be reloaned by Eletrobras to
CPFL with interest at 13 percent and with the same amortization schedule as
above   CPFL would use these funds to partially finance the third stage
development of the Peixoto Hydroelectric Station which will primaril'y con-
sist of increasing the plant capacity by 300 MV' with the addition of six kW
generating units   Recently US AID, Eletrobras and CPFL entered into an
agreement whereby CPFL became the borrower   US AID now provides funds



- 17 -
directly to CPFL   The amortization period remains unchanged and the intere-t
rate to CPFL is only 5-1/2 percent instead of 13 percent   These new arranpe
ments have been included in the financial forecasts    It is important to
note that there is a covenant in the US AID loan agreement to the effect
that the borrower cannot incur any new loans with a maturity date exceedirg
twelve months without US AID's prior approval   During negotiations assur-
ances were obtained that US AID had no objections to the proposed Bank loan
*           At the time of the sale of the AMFORP companies to the Brazilian
Government, Eletrobras not only acquired the capital stock of the companies
but also about US$64 million in debts owed by the companies to AMFORP
These debts were represented by 8 percent demand notes but the companies
aluays considered such notes as long-term indebtedness   The purchase and
sale agreement specified that service on these notes would be paid to
Eletrobras, which in turn would use the proceeds for payments on the pur-
chase price to XMFORP. The companies therefore will revalue these notes
periodically in accordance with the prevailing foreign exchange rate    At
the time of the Bank's appraisal mission in November 1965, no definite
arrangements had been made for the operating companies to repay these notes
to Eletrobras   Fixed terms have now been established for these notes as
follows   (1) interest rate 13 percent, (2) amortization payments to commence
in 1968 (Eletrobras' amortization payments to AMFORP also commence in 1968),
and, (3) amortization period of 25 years   These terms were used in connec-
tion with the financial projections in this report
57        The other loans from Eletrobras, amounting to Cr$1,923 million,
represent funds advanced to cover capital expenditures and working capital
requirements since the date of acquisition of CPFL by Eletrobras    For
purposes of this report it has been assumed that these funds will carry tne
same terms as those mentioned in the preceding paragraph, except that amorti-
zation payments will start in 1970
Past Earnings Record
58        Income Statements for the years 1961 through 1964 are shown in
Annex 4   Until early in 1965 CPFL's tariffs were based on historic costs
of its remunerable investment   Although tariff increases were made in the
past, increasing the average revenue per kwh from Cr$1 96 in 1961 to Cr$9 15
in 1964, they did not keep pace with the rapid inflation   During the perio6
from 1961 through 1964 operating results, in view of the declining value of
the currency, were poor culminating with an operating loss of Cr$1,416 mil-
lion in 1964
59        Operations were substantially improved in 1965   Increased tar-
iffs based on the revaluation applying the 1963 coefficient increased the
average revenue per kwh from Cr$9 15 in 1964 to Cr$2o 83 in 1965    Operating
income is estimated at about Cr$14 2 billion after deducting charges for
depreciation, reversion and exchange losses   Excluding income and revalu-
ation taxes this would represent a 10 3 percent rate of return on the net
fixed assets in operation at the end of the year, assuming the assets wore
valued on the basis of the 1964 coefficient   However, if the assets had



- 18 -
been valued in accordance with the 1965 coefficient, if depreciation had
been recorded at 4 percent and if no charges bad been made for reversion and
exchange losses, the rate of return would have been only 7 1 percent    ThLs
low rate of return reflects the facts that tariffs were computed on 1963
values and that they had not become effective until about mid-1965
Proposed Financing Plan
60        A forecast of Sources and Applications of Funds for the period
1966-1970 is shown in Annex 5 and summarized in the table below   During
the first three years of this period, CPFL would carry out the IBRD trans-
mission and distribution project as described in paragraphs 25, 26 and 27
which is estimated to cost Cr$208,020 million excluding interest during
construction   After the completion of the Bank's project CPFL intends to
carry out a continuous expansion program to meet the estimated annual in-
crease in demand for power   The forecast for this program for 1969 and 197C
indicates a cost of Cr$61,600 million for the two-year period   Construction
cost of the Pelxoto Project, scheduled for completion in 1968, are estimatei
at Cr$56,700 million excluding interest during construction   Capital ex-
penditures in addition to the programs described above and totalling about
Cr$19,800 million, (see paragraph 34) are expected to be incurred through-
out the 1966-1970 period
61        CPFL's fund requirements for the five-year period are expected to
total Cr$386,532 million   Capital expenditure requirements would total

63        During this period the estimated net internal cash generation
would total Cr$70,423 million after payment of debt service, revaluation
and income taxes, and dividends, or about 18 percent of the fund require-
ments
64        Under the present financial plan, share capital will be issued
during the period 1966 through 1970 for a total amount of at least equal to
that of the proposed Bank loan of Cr$91,020 million (USU4i 0 million) plus
whatever additional amounts are required in order to meet the proposed
dividend schedule (see paragraph 72)   The Cruzeiro amount of the share
capital contributions would be increased to match any increase in the
Cruzeiro amount of the Bank loan due to devaluation of the currency    During
negotiations Eletrobras agreed that it will subscr3be to the new shares in
relation to its holdings (at present 75 percent), and will also purchase eli
new shares not taken up by the minority shareholders   The financial plan
indicates a total of about Cr$175 0 billion will be required as new share
capital, or about 45 percent of the total fund requirements
65        The balance of the US AID loan (previously described in paragraph
55) of Cr$40,720 million is about 11 percent of the fund requirements
66        The proposed Bank loan of US$41 0 million is assumed to have a
term of 20 years, including a 5 year grace period with an interest rate of
6 percent   Interest during construction has not been included in the loan
67        Other resources amounting to about Cr$10,000 million, consisting
primarily of contributions in aid of construction, represents about 3 per-
cent of the total requirements
68        Under the proposed financial plan, it is estimated that by the
end of 1970, the total available funds would exceed fund requirements by
about Cru500 million or about 0 1 percent   During negotiations it was
agreed that in the event of a shortage of funds cash dividends would not be
paid, and furthermore that Eletrobras would contribute all additional funds
necessary for completing the 1966-1970 expansion program
!2stimated Future Earnings
69        The financial forecast for the five-year period, 1966 through
1970, is based on tne assumption that the Borrower achieves the required
eainings as specified in the tariff covenant included in the proposed Loan
and Guarantee Agreements, i e , a 10 percent return on the revalued average
net fixed assets in operation (see paragraph 47)   Foreign exchange expend-
itures and sources of funds have been cast in terms of the official exchange
rate as of December 31, 1965, of Cr$2,220 to US$1   As far as local currency
is concerned, normal increases in operating costs due to expanded operation'
have been considered but no provision has been made for the loss of value
of the Cruzeiro after 1965 as most of the effects will have been provided
for under the tariff arrangements and adjustments for inflation mentioned
in paragraph 41   Depreciation has been computed at a 4 percent rate and ro
charges have been shown for reversion   Kwh sales have been projected in
accordance with the load forecast as shown in paragraphi 21 and Amnex c2



- 21 -
70        The projections show that operating revenues would increase from
about Cr$36,700 million in 1965 to about Cr$94,400 million in 1970, or an
increase of about 157 percent   Operating income is expected to increase
from about Cr$14,200 million in 1965 to about Cr$41,500 million in 1970
Because of revaluations based on the 1964 and 1965 coefficients it is ex-
pected that the average price per kwh would increase from Cr$20 83 in 1965
to Cr$28 86 in 1966   In order to achieve an annual 10 percent return on
the average net fixed assets in operation the average price per kwh during
the four-year period, 1967 through 1970, would increase slightly to about
Cr$30 66
71        Operating income would cover interest charges, including capital-
ized interest, 1 6 times in 1966 and this coverage would increase annually
and reach 2 7 times in 1970   Annual debt service would be covered by inter-
nal cash generation 1 8 times in 1966 and increase to 2 6 times in 1970 as
sho'Tn in the Source and Application of Funds Statements, Annex 5  These
ample coverages reflect the large proportion of equity funds in the propobed
financial plan   Since the proposed Bank loan has a five-year grace period,
the first semi-annual amortization payment is not due until August 1971,
and the first full year's debt service will not occur until 1972    It is
estimated, however, that interest coverage would be 3 1 times and 3 5 times
in 1971 and 1972 respectively   Debt service coverage is expected to be 2 8
times and 2 9 times in 1971 and 1972 respectively
* 72        On the basis of the proposed tariff increases and estimated load
growth, all the former AIFORP companies expect to realize substantial oper-
ating profits and should be in a position to resume payment of dividerds
Eletrobras and CAEEB have therefore proposed a schedule of dividend pay-
ments for tne future   The proposal includes dividend payments starting in
1966 in accordance with the following schedule
Proposed Schedule of Dividends
Year             Dividend Rate
1966                   3%
1967                   6%
1968                   8%
1969                  10%
1970                  10%
73        Based on the fozecast of operating results as shown in Annex 4
and the availability of funds as shown in Annex 5, CPFL will be able to
declare annual cash dividends corresponding to the rates proposed in the
above schedule
Future Financial Position
74        Annex 6 shows forecast balance sheets as of December 31, 1965
through 1970   During the period under review, CPFL's net fixed assets in
operation are expected to increase from Cr$200,062 million to Cr$466,281

million, or by about 133 percent   Its fully revalued long-term debt of
about Cr$102,892 million at December 31, 1965 is expected to reach its maxi-
mum level of Cr$208,785 million by 1969 and decrease to about Cr$200,097
million in 1970
* 75        In order to maintain a satisfactory financial position through-
out the future it was agreed during negotiations to include a debt limita-
tion covenant in the Loan documents   This covenant requires that CPFL's
long-term debt outstanding at the end of any given year be limited to a
maximum of two-thirds of the total fixed assets    Such debt includes actual
debt drawdoTms rather than the amount of the loan contracts, the current
12-month portion of such debt carried in the books as current liabilities
and any short-term loans not incurred in the ordinary course of business
76        Annex 6 shows that CPFL could keep within this limitation as the
percentage of its fully revalued long-term debt to net revalued fixed
assets including work in progress is 50 percent in 1966, and decreases
annually during the next four years reaching about 41 percent in 1970
This assumes that CPFL will continue to revalue its investment to reflect
the true value of both its fixed assets and long-term loans
IX   CONCLUSIONS
* 77        The project, consisting of transmission and distribution expan-
sion, is technically and economically sound
* 78        The arrangements for engineering, procurement, and construction
are satisfactory   CPFL is capable of carrying out the project with the
assistance of CAEEB and the consultants, and of operating the facilities
thereafter
* 79        Funds necessary to complete the project, in addition to those
made available by the proposed Bank loan, are to be provided by Eletrobras
h 80        Under the Brazilian tariff regulations which permit power compa-
nies to earn a 10% return on revalued assets, CPFL should be able to
achieve and maintain a strong financial condition
81        The project would be suitable for a Bank loan of US$41 0 million
equivalent for a term of 20 years, including a 5 year grace period
December 1, 1966



CENTRAIS ELETRICAS BRASILEIRAS S A (ELETROBRAS)
* 1         Centrais Dletricas Brasileiras S A   (Eletrobras) was formed
in 1961 by the Federal Government pursuant to legislation enacted by
Congress that year and commenced operations in June 1962 following
approval of its By-Laws by Government decree   It is administered by a
President and Board of Directors, appointed for a term of three years
bv the Government
* 2         It is empowered to carry out power development studies, to
finance, construct and operate electric power generating plants and
transmission lines and directly or through subsidiaries to take such
actions as are necessary to initiate the supply of electric power in
the event of actual or prospective shortages
* 3         Eletrobras has developed along lines leading to two main
functions It is the holding company owning the major interest in
electric power utilities of the Federal Government   These include the
former AMFORP companies, FURNAS (Central Eletrica de Furnas S A )
and CHESF (Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco)   It also ad-
ministers public funds for the expansion of federal power systems, for
the expansion of non-federal utilities in appropriate cases and to
initiate power development programs in underdeveloped areas of the
country
* 4         Eletrobras obtains funds from several sources, the most impor-
tant of which are the Sole Tax and the Compulsory Loan levied on electric-
ity consumer accounts   The former is a direct tax and the rates per
kwh consumed are fixed percentages of the "fiscal rate" which is an aver-
age overall rate per kwh sold throughout the entire country   Since August
1966 the percentages are 5 percent for rural consumers, 17½< percent for
residential and industrial consumers and 20 percent for all other con-
sumers
4' 5        Commencing in July 1965 electricity consumers were required to
purchase obligations of Eletrobras in amounts equal to the Sole Tax
Since August 1966 the terms of such obligations are 6 percent interest
and a 20 year maturity   These obligations will also be revalued each
year based on the annual coefficients published by the National Economic
Council and interest and redemption payments will be made on such values
* 6         Eletrobras receives 40 percent of the proceeds of the Sole Tax
and the entire proceeds of the Compulsory Loan   Other sources of revenue
include the receipts from a percentage of federal excise tax collections
and custom assessments, interest on earnings, the proceeds of bond
issues and Government allocations
q 7         Eletrobras finances power projects by subscribing to capital
shares and through the medium of long-term debt ard short-term loans
The funds available for investment in 1965 were estimated at Cr$144,000
million (US$65 million)   In view of the ad valorem nature of the Sole
Tax and Compulsory Loan, the funds available should ircrease each year
as the result of increasing sales and higher '.ariffs
