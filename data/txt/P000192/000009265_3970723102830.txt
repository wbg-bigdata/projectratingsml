BURUNDI RUKAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower     Republic of Burundi
Beneficiary: Ministry of Rural Development
Amount      : SDR 9.6 million (US$9.5 million equivalent)
Terms       : Standard IDA terms
Project       The main objectives of the project would be (a) to improve the
Objectives : quality and quantity of water provided to the rural
population, thereby improving public health and the living
conditions of women and children who often must walk long
distances to carry water; (b) to strengthen institutional
arrangements and introduce cost recovery measures for the
rural water supply sector; and (c) to increase the
responsibility of local communities in the maintenance and
management of water supply facilities.
Project       (a) Rehabilitation and extension of rural aqueducts in 33
Description: areas; (b) Strengthening the organization of DHER and
improving its management effectiveness through the provision
of technical assistance and equipment; (c) Training for DHER's
staff and for the communal administrators, accountants and
water supply attendants. A program of sanitary education
would sensitize the population to the use of potable water.
Benefits   : The major benefit of the proposed project would be the
availability of safe potable water for about 160,000 persons
living in scattered rural settlements, and an improvement of
their health. Quantification of health benefits due to safe
water supply is not possible as a variety of other factors
influence improvements in health such as health education,
availability of food, level of economic activity and hygienic
practices. The proposed project would be however a necessary
condition of success for public health prcgrams in the areas
concerned. The project would also foster the development of
communal responsibility for infrastructure serving the
population directly and result in considerable improvements in
the planning, implementation, and supervision of rural water
programs at the country level.
Risks       : The major risks concern the maintenance of the systems.
Experience in Africa has shown that the most promising results
are derived from delegating responsibility to the village
level and fostering the sense of communal ownership, while
providing adequate back-up services and technical assistance.
Questions still remain whether the beneficiaries can be
sufficiently motivated over a long time to make the necessary
monetary outlays, and to join into communal efforts to
maintain and repair the system. The planned health
demonstration campaigns as well as the efforts to sensitize
local leaders and administrators should help minimize this
risk.

BURUNDI
RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. THU SECTOR
Country Background
1.01      Burundi is a small land-locked country in East-Central Africa.
It covers a territory of 27,835 square kilometers and has a population of
4.5 million inhabitants (160 per kn2). It is the second most densely
populated country in Africa. About 4.2 million people (93% of the total
population) are scattered in rural areas in small hamlets of less than 300
inhabitants. Only 7% of the population lives in urban centers and the
country has only one real city, the capital, Bujumbura, with a population
of 200,000 inhabitants. The growth rate is high, 2.65X. Urban growth
reaches 7 to 8 2 for the capital. The birth rate was 44 per thousand in
1979 and death rate 20 per thousand.
1.02      With an estimated Gross National Product of US$240 per capita,
Burnndi is one of the world's least developed countries. The overall
literacy rate is about 25%, average life expectancy is 45 years for men and
48 years for women, and basic social infrastructure is still lacking.
Limited natural resources, population pressure, scarcity of qualified and
experienced manpower, and isolation from main trade routes are the main
contributors to the country's poverty.
1.03      The local administration was reorganized by Decree-Law No. 1/29
of September 24, 1982. The number of provinces was increased from 8 to 15
and the number of districts, or -communes- from 79 to 114. Most of these
provinces have a small urban center, which is closely linked with rural
development and serves as a catalyst of economic activity and as the
delivery point for the provision of iLaproved services. Decentralization of
urban growth, by increasing investments in selected secondary centers, is a
major goal of the Government's Fourth Five-Year Plan. Moreover, many
ministries and administrative services are expected to move from Bujumbura
to Gitega, the second city of Burundi. In rural areas, the Government is
seeking to concentrate the population into larger villages in order to
facilitate the delivery of community services: water, electricity,
dispensaries, schools, etc. Up to now only 38 new villages have been
established in 25 communes, hecause the farmers are reluctant to move. The
local finances were reorganized in January 1984, principally to increase
local involvement and responsibility. In particular, new taxes were
established, which are to be collected by the communes. The head of the
commune is the Local Administrator, appointed by the Minister of Interior
and reporting to the Province's Governor.



-2-
later Resources
1.04   Burundi is a hilly country with good rainfall and two rainy
seasons. Therefore, it has adequate water potential for comunity water
supplies. Because of Its geology and climate, there are many sprlgs and
surface waters in the country. However, due to a lack of sanitary
protection, the quality of the water provided by these sources is eIther
doubtful (unprotected springs) or really poor (streams, marshlands). This
leads to water-borne diseases which represent more than 70Z of all endeidc
diseases (see Annex 1).
Sector Organization
1.05      A national commission for water (Commission Nationale Permonente
des Eaux) was created in March 1976 to coordinate the activities of the
different Government agencies involved In the sector and to plan the
development of water resources. It Is chaired by the Minister of
Agriculture and includes 13 directors from the ministerial departments
Involved in the sector and three persons appointed by the Minister of
Agriculture. So far, this commission has not been very active.
1.06      Water supply in urban areas (Bujumbura and 25 secondary centers)
is managed, o- soon will be managed by REGIDESO, a Government-owned
corporation which is also in charge of power supply in the country. It was
established by Decree-Law No. 1/196 of October 2, 1968, and is supervised
by the Ministry of Public Works, Energy and Mining. REGIDESO Is assisted
by several German engineers and professionals from the German Technical
Cooperation (GTZ). This assistance is directed at both REGIDESO's
electricity and water supply activities. It is complemented by the
consulting services provided by a German consulting firm (GKW) supported
mainly by GTZ funds. Sanitation in Bujumbura was handled through a
sanitation department attached to REGIDESO, but the Covernment decided to
transfer responsibility for uunicipal technical services Lncluding
sanitation to the new autonomous corporation SETEMU (Services Techniques
Municipaux). SETEMU is already active in Bujumbura and would extend its
activities to the 15 chief province towns. Sanitation services would be
financed by property and rental taxes from January 1, 1984. SETEHU Is
assisted by a German engineer, financed by GTZ.
1.07      Since February 1979, water supply in rural areas has been the
responsibility of the Department of 'Hydraulique et Electrification
Rurales" (DHER) created by Decree No. 100/18 of February 2, 1979. It Is an
autonomous department, under the Ministry of Rural Development. The DHER
is in charge of planning, design, construction and operation and
maintenance of the rural water supply schemes. Actually, due to the lack
of funds, skilled management and proper institutional and financial
arrangements, most of the rural water supply systems are not being
maintained. An important component of the proposed project would be to
strengthen DHER. In fact, the respective responsibilities of REGIDESO and
DHER are not clearly defined, particularly in the rural areas surrounding
the towns operated by REGIDESO (see para. 4.05).



-3-
Levels of Servlce
1.08         :             About 92% of the urhan population (defined as
communities with 3,000 peope or more) is served throuiRh private connections
or public standpipes.  In Bujumbura, 50,000 m3 per day are distributed to
6,098 private connections (17% of the population) and 163 standpipe. In
Gitega, the second city of hurundi, 89Z of the population is served through
365 private connections and 20 standpipes. In the nine other towns already
operated by REGIUESO, about 60,000 lnhabitants are served through 284
private connections and 60 standpipcs. About 222 of the rural population
ls served mainly through springs more or less protected and throuigh rural
aqueducts.  Water quality control is inadequate.  UsualIv, the rtral
aqueducts are old, their capAcity inadequate and they dtre in poor
condition. Peoplc not scrved rely on tunprotected gprlngs and polluted
streams or ponds which are at relattvelv great distance since people
generally live in the upper part of the hi ll  while water sourcec are at
lower levels.
1.09      Sanitation:  In Bujumhtirn. 11  of the population Is served
through a sewerage svystem. 9% through seprle tanks and S0% through pit
latrines, often used by severnl families.  It iR estimated that 12,onO new
pit latrines wnuld be needed to reach n reason.hle level of service.  In
rural areas, about 30Z nf the population Is estimated to be served through
pit latrines. The rest of the  ri:ril pori3.atlon lacks formal waste diposoal
facilities.

Total Investment costs amount to about US$Ib0 million during 1981-1990, of
which 75% (US$118 million) is for the urban population which will represent
about 10 of the total population at the end of the decade. For comparison
purposes, Government's capital expenditures for rural water supply were
US$3.9 million from 1979 to 1984, I.e. US$0.65 millton per year.
Therefore, theme targets are not realistic.
Sector Dcvelopmat
1.12      The Fourth Development Plan, 1983-1987 (are Annex 2) Includes
water supply projects for an amount of USS35.07 millton of which US$10.75
million for rural 4reas, and sanitation projecta tor Bujumbura, for a total
amount of US$23.19 million. All theme projects are sound and justifled,
except the Bujumbura sewerage project. The Government haa experienced
difficulty in finding financing because this project does not seem
justified: it Is too costly and private sanitation systems (septic tanks,
pit latrine.) would be more appropriate. Moreover, a sewerage system would
require significant recurrent expenditures for operation and maintenance,
which neither the Government nor the population can afford. During Project
implementation, an up-dated three-year investment program would be
submitted annually to IDA for Its review and comments, and the government
would ensure that Investment in the water supply sector are technically,
financially and econically justified.
1.13      Development projects are In progress for water supply In urban
areas: Bujumbura. Gitega and 23 secondary centers to be operated by
REGIDESO.  The major development project. in progress for rural areas are
the Ngozi-Kayanza project financed by Belgian hilateral Aid and the
protection of 4.,300 springs implenented by UNICEF wlth Canadlan and
Australlan financing (Ree Para. 2.06).  Details of all projects ln )rogress
are given In Annex 3.
Sector Coantraints
1.14      The. main constraints In the water supplv sector are:
(a) The lack of tinancing: and
(b) The shortage of qualltied statt In the mintstries responsible
for the sector, which results In inadequate planning and
project selection, poor supervision and lack cit decision
making capacitv on organization., and cost recovery aspects.
1.15      In the urban water supply sub-sector, the main Issue is the water
tariff which is too low (215 FBu/m3 throughout the country while the coat is
30 FBu/m3 in Bujumbura and 45 to 85 FBu/m3 in the other centers). A tariff
study to be carrled out In 1985, financed by AFDB (See PFra. 4.05), is
expected to propose a new tartff level and structure which would be applied
In 1985 for all the water systems operated by REGIDESO. Water supplied
through public standpipes is metered and billed to the municipalities but
municipal arrears have accumulated because of shortage of municipal
revenues.



1.16      In the rural water supply sub-sector, there are no decentralized
lnotitutions to maintaln the water supply facilities and no arrangements
for cost recovery. The DHER is still a young and weak institut:on
suffering acutely from a shortage of skilled staff and a lack of
resources. Annual budgets amount to the following figures, in US$:
Operating Budget             Investments
1979                                              490,000
1980                   200,000                    640,000
1981                   200,000                    780,000
19R2                   230,000                  1.200.000
1983                   210,000                    630,000
1984                   190,000                    400,000
Rural water supply systems are poorly maintalned and local authorities
(Comunal Adminlstrators) rely on the DHER which is not able to provide
required services.
1.17      For urban sanitation, adequate operation and maintenance
expenditures would be covered by property and rental taxes which have been
implemented In Bujumbura oince January 1. 1984. But there are no simllar
taxes in rural areas.
Previous Bank Involvement
I.18      The Bank was involved In an early project in this sector (Credit
No. 85-BU of USS1.1 million signed on March 31, 1966) to improve and expand
Bujumbura Wrter Supply.  This project had the following components:
-- water intake in Tanganyika Lake:
r- aw water pumping station;
- ttreatment plant;
-- treated water pumping station;
-- force mains: and
-- constrturtion of 4 reservoirs (3,900 i3).
This project was completed in 1972.  The tacillites are still In operation
and a second stape hns been started for duplication of the raw water Intake
In the Lake Tanganyika and extension of Bulumhura's water Production
facilities. The totnl cost. USS 30.0 million. 1s financed hv KFW (DM 21.n
million) for pipes. AFDR (U.A. 12.65 millton) for treatment plant, CCCE
(FF 72.0 million) for the intake, and the Government (FBu isn.0 million).
Completion is forecast for 1987.

11. POPULATION, WATER SUPPLY SERVICE AIND DEHAND IN THE PROJECT AREM
Project Area
2.01      The project is located in 32 districts, or "communes," out of a
total of 114 communes. Therefore, almost one third of the districts,
throughout the country, are covered by the project. Selection of the
components was based on the priority need for rehabilitating existing rural
water supply systems. One system only, Ruhehe, is entirely new.
Rehabilitation works amount to 16.4% of the total project cost, and
extension to 83.6%.
Organization
2.02      Every district, or  commune" is headed by a communal
administrator, nominated by the Minister of Interior, on the proposal of
the Province's Governor. He is the representative of the Governor in the
commune. He is assisted by a consultative council, composed of members
appointed for a term of three years, by the Governor, from a list proposed
by the Administrator. The number of candidates proposed should amount to
at least twice the number of vacant positions. They should have an
interest in the commune, even if they do not live there.
2.03      The commune is divided into several zones, in which the
Administrator is represented by a zone chief, appointed by the Governor. A
communal accountant is responsible for the basic bookkeeping and collection
of taxes. Every commune has also one or more water supply attendants
responsible for operation and maintenance of water facilities.
Every Saturday, the population contributes, as community labor, to the
construction or repair of dispensaries, schools, roads and, possibly, water
facilities.
Population-Level of Service
2.04      The total population of the 32 communes covered by the project is
estimated at 1,290,000 inhabitants in 1983 and would reach 1,969,000
inhabitants by the year 2000.  The annual growth rate is about 2.5%.
Although the water supply systems to be rehabilitated under the proposed
project co-ver only a part of these communes, it is expected that this
program will be continued. The areas covered by the project had 169,000
inhabitants in 1983, and are projected to have 197,000 inhabitants in 1989
and about 257,000 inhabitants by the year 2000. The percentage of this
population to be actually served by the project should reach 82% in 1989.
Annex 4 shows the figures commune-by-commune. The rest of the population
is served mainly by springs or has no access to safe water.
Exist8ing Water Supply
2.05      In 1962, there were 34 rural water supply systems, of which 16
had a pumping station. Between 1962 and 1978, about 65 new aqueducts were
constructed. All these systems were operated by the 'Association
Internationale de Developpement Rural" (AIDR) until 1978. On March 1,
1978, the Ministry of Rural Development took over operation and maintenance



of these systems, through its -Department de l'Hydraulique et de
1'Electrification Rurales' (DHER). Since 1978, DHER, with the help of
various financing institutions (FED, HCR, Belgian Aid and UNICEF)
constructed 31 new gravity aqueducts. The present number of rural water
supply systems, throughout the country, is 130, but about 50 of them are
badly maintained and need to be rehabilitated. In addition, about 300
boreholes were installed, with handpumps, but most of them are now out of
service.
2.06      With the help of USAID, CIDA, Australian Aid and United Nations
Equipment Fund, UNICEF is executing a prograid of development and protectIon
of 4,300 springs, serving about 100 people each plus, eventually, schn01s
and dispensaries. A total number of about 10,000 springs could be
developed and protected, serving about one million people. The UNICEF
program includes training of communal administrators and water supply
attendants.
Water Consu!Mtion and Ieaand
2.07      A survey carried out in 1983 by the consultants (AIDR) showed
that the average water consumption was 8 lcd (liters per capita per day),
which compares to 15 lcd in other similar countries. Since the project
would provide a standpipe at less than 500 m for everybody, it was assumed
that the demand would be 15 lcd in 1989 and 20 lcd by the year 2000 in the
project area. A household having 5.5 people on average, the demand per
family would be 80 and 110 liters per day, respectively. Only a few
private connections (about 10 in each system) would be installed under the
project.
2.08      The project would satisfy the water demand up to 2000 for most of
the systems. For the remaining systems, additional works, implemented in a
second stage from 1992 to 1995, would be needed.
Rationale for Bank Participation
2.09      The Bank's objective in the water supply sector is to support the
Government's efforts to supply the population with safe water at the least
possible cost. A subsidiary goal is to improve the operating efficiency of
the principal sector institutions, DEER and the communes, in rural areas
where institutional difficulties are the gravest. The Bank financed, in
1966, a first water supply project (Credit 85-BU) for Bujumbura which
contributed to the creation of REGIDESO. This company is now a good
institution supported by French, German and AfDB financing. On the other
hand, DHER, responsible of water supply to 93% of the country's population,
needs to be strengthened. Moreover, the project would establish a sound
cost recovery system which would be extended to all rural areas, giving to
the communee f'  responsibility for operation and maintenance of the water
systems. Finally, the Bank is the last resource for the country, since no
other donor has so far shown willingness or has the capacity to organize
the rural water supply sector. Once the first step has been made in
strengthening the institutiton in charge of rural water supply systems, it
is hoped that other donors will make available funding for rural -water
systems elsewhere in the country.

III. THE PROJECT
Genesis
3.01      At the Government's request the Bank sent a mission to Burundi in
May 1979 to identify a possible project in this sector. Following this
mission, the Government requested the Bank to consider financing a project
which would have as a main component the rehabilitation and the extension
of about 47 rural aqueducts which were constructed in the past by AIDR.
Pre-investment studies for the rural aqueducts were financed with
assistance (US$470,000) from the Bank's PPF of May 19, 1981. The Ministry
of Rural Development appointed AIDR to implement the studies under a
contract signed on December 10, 1981. Studies were completed in April 1984
and a contract for final design was signed on June 5, 1984, with the same
consultant. The design works would be completed in March 1985 for the
first lot and the bidding documents would be ready in June 1985, before
Board presentation.
3.02      In the course of carrying out the studies, the number of water
supply systems to be rehabilitated was reduced from 47 to 41: 3 systems
(Kibimba, Rugari and Musenyi) were withdrawn because financing was found
from another source, and 3 systems are to serve 2 communes each. Out of
the remaining 41 systems, 8 systems overlap with systems built or planned
by EEGIDESO with KfW financing. As it would have been very difficult to
coordinate the responsibilities of DHER and REGIDESO, the pre-appraisal
mission, in July 1984, recommended withdrawing these eight systems from the
project, leaving a total of 33.
3.03      During the preparation missions, in March and December 1983,
UNICEF requested Bank assistance in financing the spring protection project
for another three years. Some of the schemes include small gravity
pipelines to supply rural dispensaries or schools. UNICEF would have been
Executing Agency for this component and would have contributed to its
financing. The Government agreed in principle to include this component
in the proposed project but wished to find a grant to finance it. Since
this condition had not been met at the time of appraisal, the component is
not included in the proposed project.
Project Objectives
3.04      The project objectives are:
(a)  to improve the quality and quantity of water provided to the
rural population.
(b)  to improve the living conditions on the part of the rural
population (women and children particularly) who have to walk
long distances to carry water;
(c)  to increase the local population's sense of responsibility for
maintaining its water supply facilities; and



-9-
(d) to help the Government to make proper institutional and financial
arrangements for rural water supply.
3.05      The first two objectives are linked since the population would
use the safer water source only if it is also the closest one. The two
following objectives are also linked since proper development and
maintenance of the rural water supply is only financially and technically
feasible when local populations take the primary responsibility. By
focusing on rural water supply, rather than on the urban water supply or
sewerage needs of the country, the project gives priority to the main
productive sector of the economy (agriculture), and will improve the well
being of the rural population.
Project Description
3.06      The proposed project would include the following components:
(a) rehabilitation and extension of rural aqueducts in 33 areas. The
works would include the reconstruction of sub-surface intakes,
626 km of transmission lines, break-pressure tanks, storage
reservoirs, valve chambers, and 585 public standpipes. Twenty
seven of the systems would consist of gravity aqueducts. Water
would generally be distributed through public standpipes; private
connections would supply in particular dispensaries, schools,
community houses, traders and artisans. The list of the systems
concerned follows:
Lot 1: Ngozi Region
1.  Rubura - Jene        2.  Musema            3.  Bukeye

System 7, Ruhehe, is the only entirely new system. All the other
systems include rehabilitation (16.45X of the total cost) and
extension (83.55Z of the total cost).
(b) Reinforcement of DHER through the provision of technical
assistance and equipment:
(i) Project coordinator --42 man-months;
(ii) Maintenance Engineer--36 man-months;
(iii) General accountant--36 man-months;
(iv) Other consultants-8 man-months;
(v) 7 vehicles, office equipment, 1 micro-computer,
topographical and workshop equipment.
(c)  Traininu
[i)  DHER:  Training abroad for 5 DHER's staff (total 190
days), and on the job training; and
(ii)  The Communes Training Programs for:
a. 33 communal administrators (I week);
b.  33 communal accountants (I week); and
c. 60 water supply attendants (4 weeks).
This component would be completed by extensive on the *Job
training, provided by the technical assistance team anid
the consultants.
(iii)  The Population:
Program of health and sanitary education for sensitizing
the population to the use of potable water (in the field).
(d) Consulting Services
(i) Engineering services for construction supervision;
(ii) Audit of DHER's accounts; and
(iii) Feasibility studies for about 40 other rural water supply
systems.
A detailed description of the project components is given in Annex 5. The
location of the project components is shown on Map IBRD 18670.

Project Cost
3.07      The total cost of the project is estimated at YBu 1,468 million
(US$10.87 million), of which US$7.08 million, or approximately 65%,
zepresents the foreign exchange component. Base cost estimates are
expressed in prices as of early 1985. Cost of works were estimated on the
basis of consultants' feasibility studies and detailed design for the first
lot of works. Since goods and equipment for project purposes would be
imported free of customs duties and internal taxes, base costs are net of
tax liabilities. Taxes on locally procured goods (mainly cement and fuel)
estimated at 6% of local costs have been included in the estimate. They
amount to FBu 30.895 million (US$227,340). The cost estimates are detailed
in Annexes 6 and 7 and are summarized on page 12.
3.08      Physical contingencies of 12% have been added to the cost of the
works. Price contingencies have been added to base costs plus physical
contingencies; price contingencies for the project cost presented in FBu
are based on domestic inflation estimated as follows: 18% in 1985, 12Z in
1986, and 10% from 1987 onward; price contingencies for the project cost
expressed in US$ are based on estimates of lnternational inflation as
follows: 8% in 1985, 9% in 1986-88, and 7.5% in 1989. The price
contingencies were calculated on the basis of the FBu exchange rate being
adjusted to compensate for the difference between domestic and
international inflation.
3.09      The base cost estlmates for technical assistance, consulting and
training services total about US$2.4 million. The cost of training
(US$96,000) does not reflect the importance of training In the project,
because most of the training is'on the job, provided by the technical
assistance team and the consultants.
Project !inaciAg Plao
3.10      The proposed project would be mainly financed through an IDA
Credit equivalent to US$9.5 million (FBu 1,140 million). Assurances were
obtained from the Government during negotiations that it would see to it
that the communes to be served by the facilities of the project would
contribute the equivalent of about 5% of the works. This is estimated to
w&nount to US$0.27 million (FBu 32.4 million). The remainder of the
financing would be assured by a Government contribution of US$1.1 million
(FBu 132.0 million). The financing plan is indicated below:
----- US$ million -

3.11      The proposed IDA Credit would finance 87% of total project cost,
including 100 of foreign exchange requirements and 642 of local costs.
The Government would make the proceeds of the credit and its oVn
contribution available to the executing agency (DRER) and to the communes
as grants.

Iaple.entation
3.12      DHER wDuld be the implementing agency for the project.  The
director of DHER would be assisted by a project unit comprising a project
coordinator, a maintenance engln-er, an accountant and eight employees of
DHER: one sanitary engineer, one maintenance engineer, two technicians, one
accountant, oxie secretary, one driver and one office clerk. This project
unit would be financed under the project. Upon completion of the project,
the project unit would be merged with the department responsible for
planning and execution of water supply projects.
3.13      To carry out the final design studies including detailed
surveys and hydrogeological works, DHER appointed AIDR, a Belgian firm, as
engineering consultants under conditions acceptable to IDA. Another
contract is under negotiation with the same consultant for assistance in
evaluation of tenders, drafting of contracts and supervision of
construction. IDA has no objection, in principle, to the reappointment of
AIDR for these works.
3.14      Construction works would be executed in three successive lots.
According to the implementation schedule (Annex 8), detailed design would
be completed by April 1985 for the Lot 1 (NGOZI Region), bids would be
called by October 1985 and contracts awarded by March 1986. The works
would be started in July 1986 for Lot 2 and January 1988 for Lot 3, after
completion of Lot 1. Only six systems would be under construction at the
same time, in order to facilitate construction and supervision.
3.15      The communes affected by the project would contribute to the
construction in the form of labor, mainly for earthworks and supply of raw
materials (sand, gravel). In addition to the savlng, this will sensitize
the population to the value and use of safe water. One can assume they
will be more eager to keep the systems in good shape after the construction
to which they contributed is completed.
3.16      Training would be mainly the responsibility of the experts
recruited for the project unit. Training sessions would be held at the
"Centre de Perfectionnement et de Formation en Cours d'Emploi" (CPF) for
municipal administrators (1 week) and for water supply attendants (four
weeks). Moreover, on-the-job training would be provided for communal
accountants by the general accountant of the project unit and for DHER
personnel by the experts of the project unit and of the consultant's
supervision team. In addition, some DHER engineers and technicians would
attend training seminars abroad.
Procurement
3.17      Equipment, pipes and civil works would be grouped in three
bidding packages corresponding to each of the three lots of works (see
para. 3.14), and procured under international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank guidelines, except for civil works of two systems in
each lot. Separate bidding documents would be prepared for civil works of
these six systems in order to help local contractors contribute to the
project. It is expected that all equipment would come from abroad, although
two plants are manufacturing plastic pipes in Burundi, but at a higher
price than imported pipes. However, a preference equal to the applicable
customs



- 14 -
duties and other import taxes , with a maximum of 152 would be applied to
the bids of qualifying local manufacturers, If any. For civil works, a
preference of 7.5Z would be applied to bids from local civil works
contractors. CDnstruction of works would involve only three main
contracts, one for each of the three lots of works, plum possibly six
cont7acts with local contractqrs. Every contract over US$300,000 would be
subject to prior IDA review.

on the standard disbursement profile for IDA water supply and sewerage
projects in East and West Africa. The proposed closing date would be
December 31, 1991.
3.21      To ensure prompt availability of funds for the project, a
separate Special Account (revolving fund) would be established in the
"Banque de la Republique du Burundi" (BRB), with an Initial deposit by IDA
of US$0.5 million. The Special Account opening balance was calculated as
the equivalent of three months of IDA disbursements from the proceeds of
the proposed Credit, the first year, plus 20%. The Borrower would also
open in BRB a Project Advance Account with an initial deposit of FBu 25
million. Agreement was reached at negotiations that, at the beginning of
each year, the account would be replenished up to FBu 40 million.
Establishment of these accounts would be a condition of Credit
effectiveness. IDA would be given the opportunity to review DHER's annual
budget for the next fiscal year.

IV. THE DENWFICIARIES
Introduction
4.01       The beneficiaries of the proposed credit would be the communes
in whose areas the proposed water supply pro*ject would be executed.
The Department of Rural Water Resources and Electrification (DIIER) would be
the executing agency for the construction of the works and upon their
completion would hand them over to the communes. The technical assistance
component would primarily benefit DHER but would extend to the communes to
ensure proper operation and maintenance of the systems as well as billing,
collection and accounting.
The Coommunes
4.02       Beginning with fiscal year 1982 the Government started
delegating responsibility for communal services and infrastructure to the
communal level. Although this delegation varies from sector to sector it
seems to be more advanced in the rural water supply sector. Linked to this
delegation was the introduction of taxes to be collected locally for
funding for local services, as from January 1984 onward, transfer payments
from the Central Government were abolished.
4.03       The resulting system appears to work, particularly in a country
where relative remoteness of the communes combined with relative
inaccessability prove to be one of the major obstacles for collecting
revenues and taxes at a local level for funding services to be provided for
from centralized authorities. These factors and the aim to enhance local
responsibility are main reasons for (i) entrusting operation and
maintenance of the water supply systems to be financed under the proposed
project to the communes as well as (ii) covering and collecting the
resulting costs at the local level through a system of appropriate charges.
4.04       The budget of each commune is first adopted by the communes'
consultative council, then submitted to the Governor who in turn obtains
the approval from the Ministry of Interior. Since all transfer payments by
the Central Government ceased from January 1984 onward, the size of the
budget is limited by the generation of taxes imposed and collected at the
communal level. All expenditures by the commune are controlled by the
provincial inspector of the Directory of Inspection of the Ministry of
Inter'or. Expenditures exceeding FBu 100,000 have to be approved by the
governor and those exceeding FBu 200,000 by the Ministry of Interior.
The Department of Rural Water Resources and Electrification
4.05      The Department of Rural Water Resources and Electrification
(DHER) within the Ministry of Rural Development was established in 1979
with the task of improving potable water supply in rural areas and
implementing rural electrification. Clear-cut delineation of
responsibilities do not exist between DRER and REGIDESO which is
increasingly providing water supply and electricity services in the
secondary and tertiary centers in the country's interior. However this



- 17 -
question will be addressed within the context of a study covering tariffs
and institutional aspects. This study is about to start with REGIDESO as
executing agency and with financing to be provided under an existing loan
from the African Development Bank. Terms of reference of this study were
reviewed by the appraisal mission and found to be adequate to
effectively address these issues. It is proposed to create a steering
committee on which DHER, and other agencies concerned would be represented,
to oversee the exectition of the study.
4.06       As the conclusions of this study will eventually lead to a
better organizational set-up and delineation of responsibilities In the
water supply sector, an understanding was reached during negotiations
allowing the Association to review and comment on the different phases of
the study. Furthermore it should be agreed that the Government would give
the Association the opportunity to discuss any actions resulting from this
study prior to its implementation and that the Government would not modify
the present organizational set-up without prior consultation with the
Association.
Organization and Management
4.07       DHER is headed by a Director who is appointed by the President
upon nomination by the Minister of Rural Development. Its present director
has held this position since DHER's creation in 1979. A management
committee comprising DHER's director, his deputy and the heads of its
technical and administrative and finance divisions coordinates DHER's
routine operations. A Consultative Council headed by the Director General
of the Ministry l Rural Development functions as a coordinating body with
those Ministries and Government agencies having an interest in the rural
water supply and rural electrification. Its members include
representatives of the Ministry of Finance, Public Works, Interior,
Industry as well as the Director of Rural Settlements and the Director of
the Cooperatives. This council meets about twice a year and has as one of
its tasks to agree on the project proposal to be submicted to the Council
of Ministers.
4.08       Although the role of the overseeing Ministry, the Ministry of
Rural Development, as outlined in the decree establishing DHER, is limited
to major decisions, the Ministry of Rural Development exercises a strong
control of DHER's operations in particular with regard to investments and
staffing.
4.09      DHER's proposed organizational set up, which was discussed at
appraisal, is included in Annex 15. Tnis organizational structure
should make DHER more responsive to its tasks. Whereas responsibility for
operation and maintenance of rural water supply systems will be delegated
to the communal level this is not foreseen for DHER's electricity
operations, as these systems warrant continued operation and maintenance by
qualified personnel which has to be closely supervised.



- 18 -
4.10       The proposed organization divided Into four departments ti)
planning and execution of water suppl" projects, (iL' planning and
execution of electricity projects, (iii) operations and technical support,
and (iv) administration and finance under the supervision of DHER's
director should improve management effectiveness. Shortage of adequately
qualified and experienced staff combined with limited financial resources
will undoubtedly prevail over the years to come and will only gradually
disappear as staff will become more experienced. The proposed project
addresses these questions through its technical assistance and training
component (paras. 3.06 and 3.16).
4.11       Limited financial resources and dependence on bilateral/
multilateral loans for covering its investment needs, preclude long term
planning for both water supply and electricity. Although DHER participates
in the planning of and implements water and electricity projects, they are
more or less carried out on an ad hoc basis depending on the willingness of
bilateral/multilateral agenciesTorTunding these projects.  The
preparatory studies for the proposed project and the proposed study of
another additional 40 water supply systems are the first effort to select
projects for implementation according to rational selection criteria such
as least cost solution, and lowest cost per capita determined by
discounting techniques.  In this respect the proposed project would improve
DHER's planning activities.
4.12       Project management and accounting for both water supply and
electricity projects are weak. Although all expenditures associated with
the implementation of the project are recorded properly, data on the cost
of operation of each system is rather difficult to obtain and the results
raise doubt in their accuracy. There is a particular concern for DHER's
electricity operation as the billed FBu7/Kwh appear not to cover the cost
of operations and maintenance.
4.13       DHER's operational management needs to be strengthened in all
areas, ie., technical, financial, administrative and planning activities.
Given, however the slze of DHER's operations and the limited number of its
staff, a large technical assistance team would not be the ideal solution.
Instead technical assistance Is thought to be best provided for by
lndividual experts with long experience combined with country or at least
regional exposure. Terms of reference for these assignments which are
Included in Annex 10 were discussed with DHER at appraisal and will have to
be agreed upon during negotiations. As early appointment of the Project
Coordinator is crucial to project implementation, his appointment would be
a condition to declare the Credit effective. Appointment of the two other
experts, one for technical operations and maintenance, and one for
accounting should also be carried out expeditiously. Agreements wculd
therefore have to be reached during negotiations that these twn experts be
appointed within four months of Credit effectiveness.

Ylnlce
4.14       DHER's financial performance has to he assessed as that of a
department of a Ministry. Although DHER enjoys some Independence, Its
financial operations are embodied in the Government budgetary systems and
do not cnme close to those of parastatal organizations.
4.15       With the exception of charges for Installing electricity meters
and billing for electricity at the same rate as RECIDESO, DHER does not
enjoy any financial resources of its own.  Tne delegation of responsibility
for operation and malntenance of the water supply systems to the local
level linke-i with coll-eting water charges at this level will not improve
DHER's financial position. DHER will therefore have to continue to depend
on Government appropriations for its operations and investments. Transfer
payment from the commimes to DHER for services rendered for control and
advice on major repairs would be impractical and would overtax the
populacion which already is living under the relative poverty level. In
addition these amounts would be very small in relation to DHER's
operational budget.
4.16       Revennc generated through DHER's electricity operations Is small
and if collected reprcbentb onl; a minor fraction for covering its
operating cxpenseH.  The combined revenues for electricity charges and
meter installation amounted in 1983 to FBu 201,700 thus representing 1% of
DHER's operational budget.
4.17       Ihe table below sets forth the amounts that DHER received since
1980 from the Government to cover its cost of operations and investments:
(tMillion FBiz)
1980      1981        1982        1983
Operating Expenses             17.5       17.4       20.0        22.0
Investiments                   55.5      67.9       104.0        56.7
4.18       The great variations in the investment outlays reflect not only
the progress of work but also the financial situation of the Government.
The slow increase of DHER's operating expenses which more or less offset
inflation indicates the Government's wIllingness to support the costs
associated with these vital servlces for the rural population.
Assurances were therefore obtained during negotiations that theGovernuent
will continue to ccver Lhe coRt of "HER's operations and that it will
review the adequacv of the electricity charges in relation to the cost of
the services provided for.
4.19       Budgetary apprepriations are made available to DHER in quarterly
installments. Expenditures above F&u 3,000 have to be approved by the
Council for Tendering. Payments up to FBu 100,000 have to be authorized by
the DHER's Director and the Director General of the Ministry of Rural
Development and those exceeding this amount require, in addition, the
Minister's approval.



- 20 -
Personnel and Traim
4.20      DHER's staff amounted in October 198/4 to 116 out of which 50 were
employed in its water operations. Approximateiy 20 percent of DHER's staff
are permanently employed and paid according to the salary structure of
Ministries, which is significantly lower than that of parastatal agencies
like REGIDESO. The other 80 percent are contract personnel who may enjoy
higher wages but do not have the benefits of permanently employed staff and
may be dismissed at the end of their contract. Most of DHER's skilled and
semi-skilled workers and some staff at the professional level fall into
this category. Staff with managerial responsibilities are permanently
employed and have been with DHER since its creation or joined it
thereafter.
4.21      A detailed assessment of DHER staffing and training needs for its
water supply operation was carried out during project preparation and
confirmed during appraisal. As the proposed project would increase DHER's
staffing needs at least for the time of project execution and also require
that presently vacant positions be filled, some 12 new staff would have to
be recruited. Six of those would be financed out of the proposed project
as their services are directly linked to project execution.
4.22        Training would take place at all levels.  Though the three-
person technical assistance team seems small in relation to the tasks to be
carried out, it is nevertheless sufficient as most of the training would be
on-the-job training to be carried out during project implementation.
4.23       Trafning in operation and maintenance would be performed by an
operation/maintenance specialist who would ensure that DHEMTs workshop is
sufficiently equipped for carrying out regular maintenance of water and
electricity installations as well as for executing the necessary training.
This specialist would also participate in the training of the water systems
operators who would be working with the water systems contractor to obtain
a maximum degree of practical knowledge.
4.24       The technical adviser/project manager, in performing his
assignment would train counterpart staff. In addition he would review the
operations of DHER's Planning and Operations Division and implement, in
agreement with DHER's management, changes associated with training where
necessary.
4.25       The finance/accounting expert would outline and implement, after
agreement with DRER's management, systems and procedures geared to
improve DEER's accounting and financial reporting system. He would also be
responsible for designing a simplified system of accounts for the rural
water supply systems and would train the communal accountants therein as
well as in proper procedures for billing and collecting of water charges.



- 21 -
4.26       In addition training at specialized training centers in
neighbouring countries is foreseen for which an amount of US$50,000 has
been included under the proposed project. This form of training would be
essential for the water treatment plant operator, the head of the financial
division and the head of DHER's planning division. To ensure maximum
benefits from this training, terms of reference would be drawn up by the
technical assistance team and agreed upon with the trainees before their
departure.
4.27       Given DHER's staffing constraints and i,s rather short life as a
specialized agency with limited funds, this training approach appears to be
the optimum at present. Undoubtedly, continued future efforts in training
and human resource development will have to be -made, as the proposed
project represents the first step in assisting the country to strengthen
DHER as an institution capable of carrying out its assignment. Annex 11
provides more detailed information on the envisaged training program.
Accounting, Billing and Collection
4.28       The law establishing DHER exempts this agency from following
procedures and systems applicable in general to Government agencies and
departments and specifies that its accounts are to be kept on an accrual
basis using the double entry system in accordance with the plan of the
national accounting system.
4.29       However, in practice DHER's accounts and particularly, its
financial reporting system, are primarily set up to record data to
deterimne compliance with the authorized limits of the budgets for
recurrent and investment expenditur,.s (budget ordinaire, budget
extraordinaire) as set forth in the Government's budget. Since customers
charges are insignificant and relate only to electricity operations,
neither consolidated nor separate balance sheets or profit and loss
accounts exist for its water supply and electricity operations.
4.30      Although DHER's accounts are rather detailed, it is difficult to
abstract information and statistics on annual operating costs for water and
electricity services. Furthermore, its accounts are compiled in a manner
which does not readily provide data in regard to t;e investments of the
various water and electricity systams.
4.31      Consumer billing limits icse±f at present to DHER's electricity
operations in five centers where the same tariff as REGIDESO is presently
used.   In addition new customers pay for the installation of a connection
in a lump sum. To what extent meters are regularly read, bills distributed
and tiat amounts collected, is difficult to assess at present given the
location of DHER's financial operations in Bujumbura and the provision of
services in the country's interior. Furthermore, in an effort to promote
the consumption of electricity, DHER initially installed connections
without the upfront payment and did not, from the beginning, require



- 22 -
regular payment of electricity bills. This has created arrears of about
FBu 1 million of which 80 percent are due to electricity sales and 20
percent due to connection charges. Whilst the major part (70 percent) is
due from private cuetv.ters, 30 percent are due from Government agencies.
4.32      One of the major tasks of the financial management/accounting
adviser (para. 4.-3) is therefore to improve the financial management,
billing, collecting and accounting as well as the reporting and the capital
expenditure accounting systems.
Mhnagement Systems
4.33      Systematic reporting regarding DHER's operation is weak and
somewhat irregular. Although a yearly report covering DHER's operations
has been prepared in the past, its scope and depth has varied considerably
over time. Monthly, quarterly or half yearly financial reports if
prepared, are used to determine DRER's financial situation with regard to
budgetary appropriations. They do not present a meaningful management
tool. The technical assistance team is expected to establish a monthly and
quarterly management reporting system and to see to it that balance sheets,
profit and loss accounts as well as fund flow statements, are prepared
shortly after the end of DHER's financial year. It will further establish
procedures as to how to allocate expenditures between DHER's distinct
operation of water supply and provision of electricity.
4.34      During negotiations assurances were therefore obtained from DHER
that (i) it will provide to the Association on a regular basis quarterly
reports covering the progress of project works and its other operations
according to a system of agreed monitoring indicators and that (ii) it will
produce for FY86 separate accounts for its water and electricity operations
and prepare for FY86 and any fiscal year thereafter yearly income
statements, fund flow statements and balance sheets in sufficient detail to
allow for identification and assessment of its various activities.
Audit
4.35      So far an external audit of DEER's annual accounts has never been
carried out. Although the accounts of DHER are subject to control by the
Commissioner of Accounts (Commissaire aux Comptes) and the Directorate of
Inspectors of the Minlstry of Finance, like all the departments and
agencies of the Government of Burundi, a Commissioner of Accounts has so
far not been appointed and the first control by the Directorate of
Inspectors was held up and will be completed by January 1985. This lack of
sufficient control/audit clearly demonstrates the need for an external
audit of DHER which is supported by the future magnitude of DHER's
operations, particularly in relation to its past size as well as the
envisaged utilization of revolving funds (see para.3.21).



- 23 -
4.36      The employment of external auditors would also be helpful to
improve DHER's financial operations.  In order to have basic data available
with regard to DHER's operations and assets right from the beginning of the
project as well as an external assessment of its accounting system and
procedures, it is envisaged that the first audit be carried out for DHER's
fiscal year of 1985 and that a short list of qualified auditors, acceptable
to the Association, be established by June 30, 1986. During negotiations
an agreement was reached that (i) DHER's accounts will be regularly audited
by independent auditors acceptable to the Association from FY85 onwards,
(ii) the audit report including the auditor's certificate be forwarded to
the Association within six months of the end of each fiscal year and that
(iii) a shortlist of auditors for carrying out the first audit be sent to
the Association by June 30, 1986 or any other date the Association may
agree to.
4.37      Agreement was reached with D1{ER that the auditors would in
carrying out their assignment (i) verify that actual cost and disbursements
with regard to the project have been properly recorded in the project's
progress report and, (ii) certify the correctness of the amounts associated
with the operation of the revolving fund (special account).
Insurance
4.38      Similar to other Government agencies DHER has insurance coverage
for third party liability of operating its vehicles. Workmen's
Compensation is included in the social security package. In accordance
with local practice all goods and materials are, up to delivery, insured by
the suppliers. This insurance coverage seems adequate, in particular for
an agency providing potable water to thie scattered rural population where
the risk of third party liability apart from operating vehicles 's small.
V.    FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
Introduction
5.01      In the absence of a system of water charges and past practice of
the Government to cover all recurrent expenditures as well as those parts
of investments not financed through bi-or multi-lateral assistance a
meaningful financial analysis would have to identify the measures to be
taken (i) to allow for some degree of cost recovery, (ii) to guarantee the
proper maintenance of the systems to be financed under the proposed
project, and (iii) to sustain the future functioning of the implementing
and operating agencies.



- 24 -
Cost Recovery
5.02      Full cost recovery, which at present is not even achieved in
Bujumbura for municipal water, is not the appropriate target for a water
supply project that addresses itself to rectify basic imbalances in the
provision of an adequate and safe water supply for the rural population
living in scattered settlements.
5.03      Recovery to the maximum extent possible, which in this context
means participation in the form of community labor for the construction
(see para. 3.15) covering operation and maintenance expenditures,as well as
the cost of major repairs and contribution to system expansion would
enhance the sense of communal responsibility amongst the benefiting
population.
5.04      This initial contribution in the construction would represent
approximately 10 percent of the average annual communal budget. The cost
recovery for recurrent cost including major repairs and system expansion
will represent 4-6 percent of the monetary income of the directly
benefiting population; this target is considered affordable and equitable.
5.05      Annex 13 summarizes the estimated yearly expenditures for wages,
materials and annual provision for major repairs and systems extension.
The charges to be collected from the beneficiaries are shown in Annex 12.
5.06      Accordingly, beneficiaries' contribution would cover all
operating and maintenance expenses as well as contribute to a fund to be
utilized to cover major repairs and some system expansion. This is more or
less in line with stated Government policies which recently abolished all
transfer payments from the central Government to the local level for
covering recurrent expenditures associated with the provision of services
at the local level.
5.07      Once the water supply systems have been executed by DHER they
will be handed over to the village council who will be in charge of
operating and maintaining these systems. The village council would also,
through the local administrator, collect the water charges and house
connection charges which will be deposited into a separate account with the
Savings Association of Buruudi (Caisse d'Epargne du Burundi).
Blling, Collecting and Accounting of Use Mharges
5.08      The system covering meter reading, billing and collection of the
water charges for the population to be operated and maintained at the local
level, would be designed by the technical assistance team. This team would
also outline appropriate accounting procedures as well as expenditure
authorization systems. Training of local staff which include the local
adminietrators as well as local accountants in the application of these
procedures and systems would be carried out in seminars to be organized
partly on a country-wide level and partly on a regional level in



- 25 -
cooperation with the country's training center (Centre de Perfectionnement
et de Formation). Apart from providing the necessary logistic arrangements
for such seminars, this center would, through its permanent staff and
specialist assigned from various ministries, participate in these
seminars. Similar seminars ere carried out in the past with success.
5.09      All financial transactions including accounting of each commune
are under the supervision of an inspector installed at the provincial level
who reports through the inspectors at the central GDvernment level to the
Director of Inspectors of the Ministry of Interior the tulelage of the
communes. Auditing by external auditors of the accounts kept on a local
level and related to the water supply systems would not be a practical
proposition. Instead, it would be more advantageous to strengthen the
established control procedures within the Ministry of Interior, the
tutelage of the communes and a verification of the accounts by the
Inspectors of the Ministry of Finance in accordance with existing
legislation.
5.10      Existing accounting and control procedures would also, in
collaboration with the Director of Inspectors of the Ministry of the
Interior, be reviewed by the technical assistance team in order to assess
their adequacy as a control mechanism for accounting and expenditure
authorization procedures and to propose and implement modifications where
necessary. The technical assistance team would also in collaboration with
the Directorate of Inspectors and the country's training center organize
seminars for the provincial inspectors with regard to the accounting and
control procedures of the water supply systems. As the operation and
maintenance of the village water systems to be financed under the project
hinges very much on the institution of a billing, collection and accounting
system at the village level, an agreement was reached during negotiations
with the Government that it will see to it that upon handing over of the
water system to the village council (i), charges sufficient for covering
the cost of operating, maintaining, repairing and extending those systems
be instituted at levels similar to those indicated in Annex 12, (ii) these
charges be annually reviewed by end October of each year to determine their
adequacy, (iii) these charges be collected under the supervision of the
village administrator and to be deposited into a separate account with the
Savings Association of Burundi (Caisse d'Epargne du Burundi), and that only
payments with regard to the operation, extension and rehabilitation of
water systems could be made from this account, (iv) all expenditures and
the accounts related to the water system be annually verified by the
inspectors of the Ministry of Finance, and (v) reports related to the
inspection of the accounts be made available to the Association for its
review and comments.

VI.    RCONC(IC AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Project Benefits
6.01      The major benefit of the proposed project will be the
availability of safe potable water supply to that part of the rural
population living in scattered settlements grouped around administrative
centers which have so far not received an adequate share towards
improvement of their living conditions. Arrangements that would ensure
proper operation and maintenance of these systems in the long run should
demonstrate to the population that the necessary outlays to be collected in
the form of water charges be more than offset by the improved physical
well-being due to a safe potable water supply. Although health education
is a major component in the syllabi of primary schools, the lack of
adequate safe water supplies may render this a futile effort at present.
Also the health education programs conducted through the dispensaries are
an effort that can bear fruit only if safe potable water supplies are
available. The proposed project would certainly contribute to remedy this
situation. Quantification of health benefits due to safe water supply is
not possible as a variety of factors influence improvements in health, such
as health education, availability of food, level of economic activity and
application of hygiene. Thus an economic rate of return could not be
calculated.
6.02      A further benefit of no less importance will result in fostering
the development of communal responsibility for infrastructure serving
the population directly. The reinforcement of the principle of communal
participation in constructing the works and responsibility for proper
operation and maintenance should reinforce the communal structure and
should provide the basis for other improvements of human resources
development which ultimately should lead to increased economic activity
including increased agricultural production.
6.03      The possibility of drawing, in future, not only safe water from
public standpipes but having these standpipes closer to the living areas
should provide time savings which in a number of cases may be important.
Since the female population also works the fields, these savings could
directly result in greater agricultural output. The fact that working
together in the fields provides sufficient social contact, less crowded
water points should not have an adverse impact on social contact and should
therefore not bring about opposition from the population.
6.04      With regards to the institutional aspects, the proposed project
would not only create major benefits for the communes but would also result
in considerable improvements in the planning, executing and supervising the
well functioning of rural water systems at the country level. This
in3titutional strengthening should provide the basis for extending and
replicating in the future the construction, operation and maintenance of
rural water systems.



- 27 -
Project Rationale
6.05      The preceding analysis of the project's benefits is closely
linked to its justification. The proposed project will, through safe
potable water supply associated with improved health standards, potentially
contribute towards the widely recognized country objective of human
resources development and increased agricultural production.
6.06      Fostering the principle of delegating responsibility for
operation and maintenance of the water systems at the local level, is a
further step toward decentralization and should through mobilizing local
participation in construction and funding of operation and maintenance
minimize the incremental burden on the national budget.
6.07      Strengthening of the agency responsible for planning, executing
and overseeing the proper functioning of rural water supply (DHER) is
particularly important as it is possible through this agency only to
improve living conditions of the scattered rural population, one of the
major sector objectives.
Affordability
6.08      Project affordability, particularly of a rural water supply
project has to be examined on two levels (i) benefitting population and
(ii) the implication on the country 's budget both for the investment cost
and the recurrent expenditures. Alternatives were therefore scrutlaized to
identify those solutions that minimize incremental financial burdens not
only on the beneficiary but also on the country's budget in view of the
severe financial constraints of Burundi. In addition, socio-econo.ic
surveys were carried out during project preparation to establish the rural
population affordability limits and to determine its willingness to pay for
part of the services to be provided under the project.
6.09      The envisaged water charges would be within the population's
affordablity, raging from 4 percent to 6 percent of the average monetary
income. The contribution in kind should pose no difficulty as the rural
population traditionally devotes one day of work per week for improvement
of communal facilities. Although the provision of unskilled labor and
materials for execution of the project may temporarily delay other communal
improvements, the quantifiable and non quantifiable benefits of access to
safe water should more than outweigh these delays.
6.10      Surveys with regard to the population's willingness to pay
arrived at a positive conclusion. Continued willingness to pay, however,
depends to a large extent on how well the installed systems functlon, which
should be adequately covered through regular maintenance and the provision
for major repair. In the case of the village of Ruhehe where polluted
water is at present being brought in by a two hour bicycle trip and then
sold for FBu 20 per 20 liters the seemingly steep annual charge of FBu
1,438 per family represents only 50 containers of that bad water which
would not cover the family's very basic need of water over a whole year.



- 28 -
Lemat Cost Solution
6.11      The most economic alternatives for meeting the water demand were
selected. Wherever possible gravity spring ground water systems were
identified and where justified and feasible rehabilitation of existing
systems has been proposed. Only in one area where no other alternatives
existed to assure adequate continuous water supply, surface water requiring
simple treatment techniques is foreseen. Detailed studies determined the
most appropriate method for those systems requiring pumping.
Impact on Poverty Group
6.12      The poverty group in the project areas in 1984 is estimated at
about 1,431,000 (98 percent of the total population) assuming a rural
poverty threshold of FBu 1,850 ($15) per capita/month at 1984 price
levels. At the time of project completion, about 160,000 persons will
obtain their water from 580 standpipes and 533 connections. As most of
those connecticns will serve public facilities such as schools,
dispensaries, and hospital most of the water drawn there would also be
attributable to that part of the population served by standpipes. Taking
into consideration that house connections would also serve some of the
poverty target group it is reasonable to assume the poverty component of
the project is at 98 percent accordilg to the number of people served and
80 percent according to the volume of water distributed.
Project Risks
6.13      The major risks in implementing the proposed project are not so
much associated with the construction and installation of the water supply
systems but with sustained maintenance of these systems. Experience all
over Africa has shown that the most promising results with regard to this
aspect are derived from the combined effects of delegating responsibility
to the village level and fostering the sense of communal ownership.
6.14      Although this approacb appears obvious the actual results will
only be known after some time has elapsed following completion of the
system. Questions still prevail whether the benefitting population can be
sufficiently motivated over a long time to sacrifice the necessary monetary
outlays, to join into communal efforts where the systems need maintenance
and major repairs and to adopt the measures necessary to really benefit
from overall improvements in health and living conditions.
6.15      The proposed project was designed keeping chese questions in mind
and to promote to the maximum extent possible participation by the village
population already in constructing these systems. Also planned health
demonstration campaigns as well as sensitizing the local leaders to the
idea of improving health conditions should also work towards achieving this
goal of improving living conditions and thereby increasing productivity.



- 29 -
6.16      The envisaged technical assistance should improve the
institutional environment on which these efforts depend. The training
component is a further factor for mobillzing the villagers sense of
responsibility. However it would not be prudent to assume that the
villagers could solve all the maintenance problems on their own. The
outside support structure would be provided by DHER, which raises the
question whether DHER could provide this even after completion of project
implementation. The provisions made with regard to this aspect combined
with the simplicity of the water systems should minimize this risk.
6.17      Delays in project implementation should be small as bidding would
be well advanced at time of presentation of this project to the Board of
Directors. The phasing of project execution in three phases, distinct in
time, should further allow that lessons learned while executing the first
part can be applied.
6.18      Project risks therefore are acceptable when considering the
benefits that would be derived from project Implementation.
Monitoring
6.19      Critical indicators, which were agreed upon during negotiations,
and which will be compiled in quarterly and semi-annual reports, would
monitor the progress of the proposed project. Within six months of project
completion DHER would prepare and submit to the Association a project
completion report on the basis of an outline mutually agreed upon.
VII. AGREEMINTS RKACH8D AND RECOMhENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
on the following points:
(a)  The Government would ensure that every commune would contribute
at least 5% of the total cost of works performed in the commune
(para. 3.10);
(b)  The Government would provide funds to finance the balance of the
project cost in accordance with the agreed implementation
schedule (Annex 8) and would establish a Project Advance Account
with an initial deposit of FBu 25.0 million (para. 3.21). This
account would be replenished up to FBu 40.0 million at the
beginning of each year. IDA would be given the opportunity to
review DHER's annual budget for the next fiscal year (para.
3.21);
(c)  The Government would establish a steering committee to oversee
the execution of the tariff and institutional study financed by
AfDB, would give the Association the opportunity to review and
comment on the different phases of study, and to discuss any
actions resulting from this study prior to its implementation,
and the Government would not modify the present organization of
the sector without prior consultation with the Association
(para. 4.06);



- 30 -
(d)  During Project iaplementation, an up-dated three-year investment
program would be submitted annually to IDA for its review and
comments (para. 1.12); and the government would ensure that
investment in the water supply sector would be technically,
financially and economically justified.
(e)  The accounting/financial adviser and the maintenance/operations
adviser would be appointed within four months of Credit
effectiveness (para. 4.13);
(f)  The Gbvernment would continue to cover cost of DHER's operations
and would review the adequacy of the electricity charges in
relation to the cost of the services provided for (para. 4.18);
(g)  DHER's accounts would be audited by external auditors acceptable
to the Association from FY85 onwards, the audit report including
the auditor's certificate would be forwarded to the Association
within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year and a shortlist of
auditors would be sent to the Association by June 30, 1986
(para. 4.36);
(h)  DHER's auditor would, while carrying out his assignment:  (i)
verify that actual cost and disbursements with regard to the
project have been properly recorded in the projects progress
report and (ii) certify the correctness of the amounts associated
with the operation of the revolving fund (special account)
(para. 4.37);
gi) The Government will see to it that upon handing over of the water
system to the village council that:
Mi) charges are sufficient for covering their cost of
operating, maintaining and repairing as well as provide
some amounts toward their extension;
'ii)  charges be reviewed annually by end of October of each
year to determine their adequacy;
(iii)  these charges be collected under the supervision of the
village administrator to be deposited into a separate
account with the Savings Association of Burundi (Caisse
d'Epargne du Burundi) and that only payments with regard
to the operation, extension and rehabilitation of water
systems could be made for this account;
(iv)  all expenditures and the accounts related to the water
system be annually verified by the inspectors of the
Ministry of Finance; and
(v) reports related to the inspection of the accounts be made
available to the Association for its review and comments
(para. 5.11); and



- 31 -
(j) DHER would prepare quarterly progress reports and a project
completion report (par&. 6.19).
7.02      Subject to the foregoing conditions, the proposed project is
suitable for an IDA credit of SD  9.6 (US$9.5 milion).

Bubanza, Makamba, Mabanda, Matana, Hwisare, Karusi, Mbara and
Cankuzo. Financed by KfW (DM 3.0 million). Completion is
forecast for the end of 1984;
(d)  Water Supply Component of IDA Urban Development Project in the
suburbs of Bujumbura: installation of standpipes;
(e)  Bujumbura - Phase II.  Duplication of the raw water intake in the
Tanganyika Lake and extension of Bujumbura's water production
facilities. Total cost US$30.0 million financed by: KfW (DM 21
million) for pipes, AfDB (U.A. 12.65 million) for treataent plant,
CCCE (FF 72.0 million) for the intake, and the Government (US$1.5
million). Completion is forecast for 1987; and
(f)  Water Supply Schemes for Five Secondary Centers.  Gihanza,

RURAL WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Assumptions for Financia' Projections
Introduction
1.        Revenues, cost of operation and replacement requirements were
projected for each of the 33 centers starting wlth the date of
comissioning. Although the iperations of each center would be
administered separately the projections were consolidated for comparison
reasons.
Population
2.        The population was estimated for each center on the basis of the
1979 census. Having made adjustments for different growth patterns up to
1987 all annual growth of 2.7% was assumed thereafter. The repartitlon of
the population according to the source of water (house connection,
standpipe, water point) was arrived at in analyzing the living conditions
in each center. Service perimeter of a standpipe was assumed not to exceed
500 M.
Revenues
3.        Setting out from a basic tariff structure for the three consumer
categories, I.e.
(a) FBu 25 per m3 for metered consumption;
(b) FBu 350 per family/year for water drawn at stand posts; and
(c) FBu 70 per family/year for water drawn at water points,
tariffs were projected to such a level that would ensure
coverlng operating and maintenance expenses, a charge towards
major rehabilitation expenses as well as to set aside a small
fund for system extensions. In order not to overtax that
part of the population that draws water from water points a
ceiling of FBu 70 per family/year (end 1984 price level) was
established for those centers where investments and operating
expenses are likely to be higher than in the majorlty of
centers.
4.        The resultlng tariffs are shown in Annex 13 and have been
adjusted for increases in Inputs.
Operatlig Expenses
S.        Operating expenses were estimated by taking into consideration
the requirements for:
(a) labour;
(b) materials;
(c) energy; and
td) maintenance expenses.

ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 2
6.         Outlays for labour cover the charges for the locally employed
personnel such as plumber/operator. helpers, administrative clerks.
Materials represent parts used for regular maintenance. Under maintenance
expenses are summarized all charges for outside assistance In maintaining
the system as well as miscellaneous expenses.
Replacement
7.        A yearly replacement provision of 2.5% of the original Investment
was assumed. which is adequate in light of the simplicity of the systems to
be constructed.
Price Adjustments
8.         Tariffs and Operating Expenses were adlusted for price increases
up to 1987. Thereafter an annual provislon of 10% is assumed.
