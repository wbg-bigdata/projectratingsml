RURAL SERVICES PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:         The Solomon Islands
Amount:           SDR 3.3 million (US$3.5 million)
Terms:            Standard IDA terms.
Project
Description:    The project would expand and improve the country's agricul-
tural support services in the areas of research, education,
training and extension services, and foster development of
rural enterprises. The credit would finance expenditures
for civil works; equipment, furniture and vehicles; salaries
of expatriate and national staff; travel expenses; opera-
tional expenses, such as materials and supplies, utilities,
and operation of vehicles; consultancies; and fellowships.
Benefits:         Benefits would accrue to some 9,000 smallholders spread
throughout the country who raise mainly coconut and food-
crops. The main benefits expected from the project are:
(a) increased productivity from investment in research,
extension and rural infrastructure; (b) an increase in cost
effectiveness and operating efficiency of government ser-
vices; (c) greater availability of suitably trained man-
power; (d) increased participation of the smallholders in
the growth of the cash economy; te) expansion and diversifi-
cation of agricultural production and exports; (f) increased
foreign exchange earnings and government revenue as a result
of export ta-ration; and (g) development of off-farm skills,
which would enable rural people to establish and operate
small rural enterprises.
Risks:            Possible constraints to timely implementation of the project
are the expeditious recruitment of necessary staff and close
cooperation between the national and provincial agricultural
services and other national departments. To reduce this
risk, a Project Implementation Unit would be established and
investments have been phased to provide adequate lead times
for staff recruitment.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTEKNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO SOLOMON ISLANDS
FOR THE RURAL SERVICES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following Report and Recomuendation on a proposed
credit on standard IDA terms to the Solomon Islands for the equivalent of SDR
*       3.3 million (US$3.5 million) to help finance the Rural Services Project.  The
project would be cofinanced on a parallel basis with the Asian Development
Bank (ADB) as the lead institution; ADB would provide SDR 4.930 million,
*       (US$5.0 million) from its Special Fund resources,/l plus a technical
assistance grant of US$90,000 equivalent. The International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD) will provide $1.5 million equivalent on a
parallel basis on terms and conditions to be agreed.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The Bank Group-s first report since the country's independence (The
Solomon Islands: An Introductory Economic Report, No. 2553-SOL) is dated
December 18, 1979. Basic country data are given in Annex I. In June 1983,
the world Bank and the UNDP issued an energy assessment report (Solomon
Islands: Issues and Options in the Energy Sector; No. 4404-SOL). The
following sections incorporate information obtained by ADB and IMF during
recent missions. An economic mission visited the country in October 1983.
Structure of the Economy
3.        The Solomon Islands, which constitutes a scattered archipelago east
of Papua New Guinea, a British protectorate since 1893, gained its indepen-
dence in July 1978. The country had a population of 241,000 and a per capita
GNP of US$660 in 1982. Six main islands account for most of the population
and the land area of some 29,000 sq km. Although the population is racially
homogeneous (about 93% Melanesian), at least 87 vernacular languages are
spoken. Most of the population reside in small, widely dispersed settlements
along the roasts; 60% of the people live in localities with fewer than 100
inhabitants and more than 8O% in localities with fewer than 200. The capital
city of Honiara, situated on Guadalcanal, the largest island, has 16,000 inha-
*       bitants; other urban centers have less than 2,000 inhabitants each.  Inter-
island shipping is the main mode of transportation.
4.        Solomon Islands is a predominantly agricultural economy.  Subsis-
tence (nonmonetary) production is an important component of total output. It
contributes 40% of GDP, and nine out of ten households are engaged in subsis-
tence food production to some extent. As is typical of the islands of the
Pacific, the basic needs of the population are reasonably well met from
/1   ADB Appraisal Report refers to this as Part A of Loan.



-2-
subsistence activities. Reflecting the size of the subsistence sector, the
proportion of the labor force engaged in paid employment is limited. Between
1978 and 1982, only about 20% of the labor force was employed as full-time
salary and wage earners, and an additional 27-28% derived some cash income
from copra and market gardening. Thus only about 48% of the labor force was
engaged in cash earning occupations.
Recent Developments
5.        After an impressive growth performance in the 19709 (8% p.a. growth
of real GDP), the Solomon Islands' economy recorded a sharp downturn In the
1980s, with real GDP estimated to have declined by 2.5% p.a. between 1980 and
1982. The continued world economic recession and the deteriorating terms of
trade more than offset favorable supply conditions, i.e. new investments in
the timber industry and new planting of palm oil and coconut trees in the mid-
to late 70s, causing a decline in real domestic income. The weak external
demand in turn led to a weak domestic aggregate demand; domestic inflation
slowed down considerably to 10% in 1982 from 16% in 1980, in large part
because of lower import prices while investment also declined because of the
lower level of overall economic activity, especially the lower profitability
in the export sector. The noncash sector of the economy, which contributes
over one-third of GDP, seems to have withstood the economic downturn well as
basic needs are reasonably met from subsistence.
6.        Between 1980 and 1982, the growth in total revenue and grants did
not keep pace with that in total expenditures. Current expenditures on the
newly decentralized administrations and an 8% increase in salaries and wages
in the public sector accounted for the growth in expenditures.- As a result of
the depressed level of economic activity, revenue was less buoyant than in
previous years.  Thus, in spite of a slowdown in development expenditures,
owing to project preparation and implementation difficulties at provincial
levels, the overall budgetary deficit increased to 6.8% in 1982 from 2.8% of
GDP in 1980. Financing of the budgetary deficit was almost equally divided
between borrowings from the National Provident Fund and the domestic banking
system. The latter, for the first time, became an important source of
financing as there was some slack in the demand for credit by the domestic
private sector.
7.        In spite of the weakened external demand for most of the country's
export commodities, the external current account deficit in the balance of
payments improved in 1982 to 132 of GDP from 27% in 1981. However, this
improvement reflects the lower level of economic activity, the associated
lower imports of consumer and capital goods, the lower freight and insurance
charges and the lower external prices. To shore up its short-term balance of
payments difficulties, the country resorted to judicious external borrowing
from commercial sources and multilateral institutions in the 1980-82 period,
including a recent SDR 2.4 million standby credit from the IMF in 1983. More-
over, in August 1982, the Government depreciated the SI$ by 10% to ensure the
country's competitiveness in export markets, which was eroding because of a
somewhat overvalued exchange rate. The Solomon Island-s debt service rose to
3.6% of exports of goods and services in 1982 from much lower levels in pre-
vious years, following the assumption of a syndicated Eurodollar loan of
US$20 million by the Government. Nevertheless, the debt service ratio remains



-3-
low and the level of international reserves at the end of 1982 was comfort-
able, equivalent to about seven months of import requirements. Moreover,
medium term prospects for external development assistance appear reasonably
good.
Development Issues
8.        With a young and fast growing labor force, the Government faces the
challenge of creating employment opportunities in the large subsistence
sector. While some export diversification took place between 1976 and 1980,
it was limited to large-scale commercial agriculture with minimal impact on
the smallholders and the subsistence sectors. Unfortunately, the growth in
the labor force outpaced the growth in formal wage and salary employment, even
during periods of high economic growth, and fast expansion of commercial agri-
culture. This suggests that future employment growth would have to come from
the noncommercial subsector within agriculture, i.e. snallholders and
subsistence farmers.
9.        Human resource development is far from adequate in the Solomon
Islands as roughly measured by a few social indicators. The only available
data indicate that, in the early 70s, the adjusted enrollment ratio, for
primary and secondary education were, respectively, 61X and 7%, while the
adult literacy rate stood at 9%. The low level of educational achievement
explains the severe shortages of local skilled and semi-skilled labor and of
high level manpower for the public and private sectors. Decentralization and
localization have undoubtedly accentuated these shortages. The shortage of
manpower is a major development constraint.
10.       Aware of the fact that the agricultural sector is the backbone of
the economy, the Government, in its first National Development Plan, 1980-
1984, emphasizes export diversification, balanced development of smallholder
agriculture and estates, the strengthening of the agricultural marketing and
distribution systems, the appropriate agricultural support services, and
education. The Rural Services Project is consistent with these sectoral
priorities in that it addresses the needs of smallholders for agricultural
support services, i.e. extension, research, requisite manpower and suitable
training facilities. At the same time, it also assists provincial governments
in building up their project preparation and implementation capacity which is
weak.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
11.       Two credits have been made to the Solomon Islands, one for a primary
education project and the other for an IDF operation totalling SDR 5.6 mlllion
(US$6.5 million equivalent). The Bank Group-s lending strategy for the
Solomon Islands strongly emphasizes cofinancing of select operations with the
ADB as the lead cofinancing agency, while increasing our economic and sector
work activities. IDA lending will be primarily in the agriculture and
education sectors, with a focus on increasing rural cash incomes, and
improving and expanding the educational system. A lower secondary education
project is tentatively scheduled for FY87. The proposed project will provide



- 4 -
smallholders with the opportunity for increased productivity, income and
improved standards of living and will develop and expand the Government's
capability to provide agricultural support services and facilities.
12.       As of September 31, 1983, the amount of effective credits to the
Solomon Islands held by the Bank Group amounted to US$6.5 million
equivalent. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits.
Disbursement Performance
13.       Only twio projects are currently being implemented in the Solomon
Tslands. The first credit of US$1.5 million (SDR 1.3 million) for the Solomon
Islands Development Bank became effective in July 1981. Not long afterwards
it became apparent that credit proceeds were not being disbursed as antici-
pated because of subloans contained smaller than anticipated foreign exchange
components. Therefore, steps have been taken to authorize disbursement of a
share of total project costs. On this basis funds should be rapidly drawn
down. For the second credit of US$5.0 million (SDR 4.3 million) which
financed a pricing education project, which because effective on July 19,
1982, disbursements are well ahead of schedule. A revolving fund or special
account has been established to facilitate rapid disbursement. For the
proposed project a special disbursement procedure will be used so that IDA
funds can be a advanced to the Government semi-annually.
PART III - AGRICULTURE AND RURAL SERVICES
Agriculture in the Solomon Islands
14.       Agriculture contributes about 702 of the GDP, accounts for 90Z of
exports and provides some 30% of paid employment. A vast tract of land is
under forest and cultivable land is limited. The economy is basically
rural; about 90% of the population reside in rural settlements which are gen-
erally isolated and dispersed, and are engaged mainly in subsistence agricul-
ture. The average size of the farm unit per household consists of 0.15 to
0.25 ha of food crops and 1.5 to 2.0 ha of coconut plots. The staple food
crops are sweet potatoes, taro and yam. Their yields are low, which is attri-
butable to traditional cultural practices, non-adoption of improved varieties
and non-application of technical inputs.  Because of increasing population
pressures, the cycle of fallow period is being shortened, thereby leading to
soil depletion and reduced yields.
15.       The smallholder cash crop production consists primarily of coconut,
which is gradually being supplemented with cocoa. Of the total area of
52,000 ha under coconut, 38,000 ha belong to smallholders. Over 65% of all
rural households are involved in coconut growing. Of total coconut produc-
tion, about 30% is consumed as food, 50% is sold and the remaining 20% goes to
waste. Copra production by smallholders is estimated at 46,000 tons which
account for about 70% of the total copra exports. To most smallholders, copra
sale is the only source of cash income. Because of low copra prices in the
recent past, there has been a significant fall in the cash income of the
smallholders. Consequently, there is a tendency to migrate to urban centers.



- 5 -
16.       The system of food crop and coconut production of constderable scope
for technological improvements. There is also need to diversify the produc-
tion base and, consequently, incomes. Cash crops, sucn as ginger, chillies,
cardamon, coffee, and turmeric, whtch have high value to weight ratios offer
good possibilities.
Constraints to Agricultural Development
17.       Agricultural development is handicapped by the following
constraints:
(a) Lack of research on improved seeds, better cultural practices, and
new cash crops to diversify the production base.
(b) Weakness of the extension service, both in terms of number and
training.
(c) Very high costs for collection, processing and marketing of produce
caused by dispersed location of production areas, diseconomies in
transport, storage, sale of inputs and insecticides, and the
isolated domestic markets for crops.
Development Objectives and Strategy
18.       The Government's key development objectives are to increase:
(a) cash income of farmers; (b) food crop production, while improving nutri-
tional standards; and (c) employment in rural areas. The Government-s stra-
tegy for overcoming the development constraints and achieving these key objec-
tives aims at strengthening the required support services in the rural areas
to expand the production base, diversify agriculture, and establish and
improve necessary facilities for collection, processing, grading and marketing
of the produce. Specifically, agriculture research and extension would be
upgraded, and training facilities expanded for farmers and extension work-
ers. In addition, inter-island trade and rural markets would be improved, and
powers and functions for agricultural development delegated to the provincial
governments.
Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
19.       This will be the Bank Group-s first operation in the sector,
although the Development Bank of the Solomon Islands Project (Credit 1115-SOL,
US$1.3 equivalent, approved March 17, 1981) supports subloans to the indige-
nous population in agriculture as well as in other sectors. The Bank Group
supports the policies of the Government in improving the support services for
agriculture, which is the key sector in the economy. It has agreed to
cofinance selected projects in this and other sectors with the Asian
Development Bank as the lead institution. Livestock improvements are being
addressed under the ADB Livestock Development Project, being financed by ADB
jointly with this proposed project.

Agriculture Support Services
20.       Agricultural support services are provided by the Government through
the Ministry of Home and National Development (MHAND). The commercial sector,
mostly in the form of joint ventures between foreign private companies and t.he
Government, in partly engaged In adaptive research on plantation crops.
21.       Agricultural Research.  The Government's agricultural research
activities have been limited to the Dodo Creek Research Complex and its field
experiment station at Tenaru since 1975. The research program has been
directed mainly to the genetic improvement of the root crops, control of pests                m
and diseases, and improvement of soil fertility. There are, however, signifi-
cant gaps in the agricultural research on whole farming systems, adaptive
research, and crop diversification and economics of new varieties. Also there
is a dearth of socio-economic, base-line data on smallholder production
systems.
22.       Agricultural Extension.  The extension services have been target-
oriented and have emphasized individual cash crops, rather than farming sys-
tems. The present staff of the extension service have been poorly trained.
The recent devolution of responsibility for the extension work to the pro-
vinces has further weakened services. There is urgent need to expand and
improve training facilities for the extension staff and for farmers. The
housing facilities, transport and demonstration equipment available to the
extension personnel are extremely poor, leading to frustration and demoraliza-
tion. This has resulted in high attrition among personnel.
23.       Agricultural Information.  An agricultural information unit had been
functioning until about a decade ago when it was abolished, reportedly due to
budgetary constraints. Consequently, at present there is little linkage
between research and extension, and between research and the farmer.
24.       Agricultural Training.  There are four farmers' training centers
(FTC) in the country, which have been set up to provide training to farmers
and village extension workers. But the objectives of these centers remain
unfulfilled, since there is a dearth of scientific research information on
which to base modern agricultural development.
25. Pricing Policies. In general the Government has allowed market forces to
determine agricultural commodity prices, the exceptions being copra and
livestock prices. The Copra Board, by maintaining relatively high and uniform
farmgate prices for producers, has stimulated increased production in recent
years. The Government currently is drafting legislation to convert the Copra
Board into a Commodity Board which would then include other commercial crops
in its price and marketing support operations. To date the Board's main
function has been to cushion the indigenous producers against fluctuations in
the world price for copra by operating a price stabilization fund - levies are
deducted when prices are high and bounties are paid in times of low prices.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
26.       In response to the Government's concern about declining productivity
and income from the agricultural sector, the International Services for
National Agriculture Research (ISNAR) from the Netherlands completed In 1982 a
feasibility study on strengthening agricultural research, extension and
support facilities. A study on establishing rural development centers was
*        conducted by Development Alternatives, Inc. USA.  In July 1983, an ADB mission
appraised the proposed project. IDA credit negotiations with the Government
were held from November 8 to 10, 1983. An appraisal report prepared by ADB is
being distributed separately. Supplementary project data are provided in
Annex III.
Project Objectlves
27.       The project would initiate efforts to overcome existing constraints
in the agricultural sector by strengthening research and extension, establish-
ing necessary Infrastructure in rural areas, improving transportation, and
facilitating and diversifying marketing.
28.       The project consists of the following main components:
A. IDA-f inanced Components
29.       Research.  The Government-s research activities are limited and
deficient in many ways (para. 21). The project provides for alleviation of
these constraints by: (i) improvement and expansion of research facilities at
the Dodo Creek and Tenaru Research Stations; and (ii) establishment of four
adequately staffed and equipped research sub-stations. Consultancy services,
consisting of a Food Crop Agronomist (36 man-months), Agricultural Economist
(36 man-months), and 9 man-months of short term consultants in various
specialist disciplines, would be provided to assist in the implementation of
above research efforts. The proposed research stations would have offices,
laboratories, libraries, stores, workshops, rest houses for visiting research
scientists, as well as housing accommodation for staff and labor. The project
includes the civil works, equipment, staff and consultant costs, training and
operating costs.
30.       Extension. The present living and working conditions of the field
assistants are unattractive, which results in staff frustration and attri-
tion. These conditions would be improved by constructing 30 houses for field
assistants and providing them with about 120 sprayers and a range of agro-
chemicals.
31.       Agricultural Information Unit (AIU).  An agricultural information
unit will be established under the project to distribute specific research
findings, circulate handbook-type reference materials, develop training aids
for extension staff and farmers, formulate programs for media and provide
expertise in producing and arranging the required information. The tasks of
the AIU will be organized into three areas: receiving essential inputs;



- a -
sharing and coordinating information within the organization; and transmitting
the output to the extension personnel and farmers. The AIU would be located
at Honiara, in MHAN1). The projoct would finance facilities for offices,
printing, transport, information processing, salaries and operating costs for
about four years. The unit would be staffed by an expatriate agricultural
information specialist (36 man-months), and two information assistants and
overseas study tours would be provided together with training fellowships (30
man-months).  The expatriate Agricultural Information Specialist would be
appointed for three years, while a Solomon Islander is trained abroad to
replace him as Senior Agricultural Information Specialist (covenanted In the
ADB loan agreement).
B. IFAD-financed Components
32.       Agricultural Training will be Improved by:
(i) Establlshment of the National Agricultural Training Institute (NATI)
This institute, in its early years, would provide pre- and in-
service training to extension staff, and demonstration and training
to smallholders; in later years it would offer certificate/diploma
courses. The project provides for (i) constructlon of offices,
dormitories, lecture rooms, library, workshops and staff quarters;
(ii) provision of farm and transport equipment, teaching material
and equipment and operating costs; and (i.i) the services of the
teaching staff, including an expatriate principal (48 man-months)
and fellowships (6 man-months). The expatriate principal will
assist in the establishment of NATI, design courses and formulate
methods of training, and review and coordinate the training provided
by NATI and FTCs. The Government has given its assurances that it
will identify an appropriate national as deputy principal for NATI
and that, after suitable on-the-job training by the expatriate
principal, he shall be appointed principal of NATI (covenanted in
the ADB loan agreement).
(ii)  Relocation of a Farmers Training Center (FTC).  The lease of an
existing FTC located in Barakoma (Western province) is expiring in
1985 and the smallholders are keen to have their land back. It is
proposed to relocate this FTC to Rendova Harbor (Wep'-'rn province)
where land, totalling about 670 ha, and other facil..ies are already
available.  Funding under the project would include construction of
an office, a dormitory, a lecture room, mess block, staff houses and
provision of farm and teaching equipment and operating costs.
C. ADB-financed Components
33.       Rural Development Centers (RDC)  Seven RDCs will be established and
operated, along with necessary staffing and facilities in each province of the
country.  These centers will have storage, marketing and shipment facilities;
copra dryers, cocoa dryer and fermenters; tractors with trailers, canoes and
portable saw-mills. At each RDC a small farm would be developed for demon-
stration and training of improved farming systems. The RDCs would be equipped
with other facilities such as necessary housing, utilities, internal roads and
sheds, classrooms, dormitories, furniture for office and trainees, and radios



for communication. Some of the RDCs would also provide training in off-farm
enterprises, such as, small rural industries, engine repair, wood working,
saw-milling and boat construction. The on-farm traiaing provided and
facilities available at the center would help stimulate development of
villages neighboring the center.
34.       To overcome transportation constraints, which are presentlv hinder-
ing the collection of copra and availability of improved plant and seed
material, four existing wharves would be rehabilitated and two new wharves
constructed in the vicinity of six of the RDCs. In addition, feeder roads (24
km) from two RDCs to production areas would be upgraded.  Necessary consul-
tancy (10 man-months) and training for the effective functioning of these
centers of activity would also be provided.
35.       Project Implementation Unit (PIU).  The PIU to be established in
MRAND would be responsible for coordination and implementation of the proj-
ect. It would be headed by a Project Director, who would be assisted by two
expatriates: one project advisor (36 man-months) and one consultant on
engineering and construction (36 man-months). Administrative support would be
provided to the PIU, which would include an administrative officer, typist-
cum-clerk, driver and transport, etc. The Project Director, a senior national
civil service officer, would be responsible for planning, coordination and
implementation of the project, and would report directly to the Permanent
Secretary of MHAND. The project includes the establishment, staffing and
operating costs of PIU.
Project Cost
36.       Total project cost is estimated at US$11.65 million over a si=-yFar
implementation period. Of this, the foreign exchange component would be
US$5.93 million (51%), and the local currency costs, US$5.72 million (49%).
Base cost estimates are expressed in July 1983 prices and are net of taxes and
duties. The estimate includes operation and maintenance costs of the research
station at Dodo Creek for five years; and similar costs for the four research
sub-stations, the FTC at Rendova harbor and the seven RDCs for 2.5 years after
completion of construction. Physical contingencies at 1OZ were applied on
civil works, equipment and recurrent costs. Price contingencies were calcu-
lated at 8% for 1983, 7.5% for 1984, 7% for 1985 and 62 per annum thereafter
on foreign exchange costs and at 10% per annum on local currency costs,
totalling about 29% of the base cost plus physical contingencies. Consultant
service costs amount to US$1.7 million for 235 manrmonths, at an average cost
of $7,200 per man month for salaries, leave fares and other benefits.
37.       Recurrent costs after completion of the project would be roughly
US$600,000, or 2% of Government-s existing recurrent budget.
Financing Plan
38.       The project would be financed by ADB, IDA, IFAD and the Government
of the Solomon Islands on a parallel basis according to the distribution of
works shown below:

39.       The IDA credit would finance the full foreign exchange costs
(US$2.06 million) and 88% of local costs (US$1.44 million) for the research
station at Dodo Creek and the four research substations, the Agricultural
Information Unit and facilities for the field assistants. ADB would finance
the seven RDCs, the PIU and interest during construction. IFAD would finance
NATI and the relocation of the FTC. In accordance with the agreement to be
contained in the letter of Credit Administration between IDA and ADB, the IDA
funds would be administered by the ADB. Special conditions of the effective-
ness of the IDA credit are that all conditions precedent to the effectiveness
of the ADB loan and grant have been fulfilled (draft Development Credit
Agreement, Section 6.01a,b).
Implementation Schedule
40.       The project would be implemented over a period of six years from
about mid-1984 to mid-1990. The first six months would be spent on the estab-
lishment of the Project Implementation Unit, recruitment of project consul-
tants including the Project Advisor and the Engineering and Construction Conr-
sultant, and other preparatory work. Construction and staff recruitment is
phased over six-years to ensure compatibility with the implementation capacity
of the executing agencies. The closing date for the IDA-financed components
of the project is December 31, 1990; and we expect these components to be com-
pleted by June 30, 1990, six months ahead of the ADB project.
Project Implementation
41.       The PIU will be responsible for the overall implementation of the
project (para. 35). The Chief Research Officer in the NHAND will be in charge
of the research component, while the Chief Field Officer will be in charge of
the NATI, FTC, AIU and Field Assistants components. In all project-related
matters, the Chief Research Officer and the Chief Field Officer would work in
consultation and overall guidance of the Project Dirctor. Since the project
requires close coordination between ministries of the Central and Provincial
Governments, a National Coordinating Group would be set up at the central
level to be chaired by the Permanent Secretary of MHAND, and would include



- 11 -
representatives from Ministry of Finance, Provincial Affairs and Transport,
Natlonal Planning Office, and the Copra Board. The Project Director will be
the Secretary of the Group. Major policy and operational guidelines for
project execution would be initiated and monitored by the Group. At the
provincial level, the provincial secretary will coordinate the construction of
RDCs in the province concerned. He will be assisted by the Project Officer in
charge of each RDC; to ensure the close involvement of local people in the
programs and operation of RDCs, the provincial government will form an
association of local people for each RDC.
42.       A Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation Unit is being set up
(under a separate ADB-financed project) in the National Planning Office, which
will monitor the benefits and evaluate the impact of the project on the bene-
ficiaries. The establishment of both the National Coordinating Group and the
Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation Unit are conditions of effectiveness
of the ADB loan.
Manpower Requirements
43.       The incremental staffing needs of the project for all the components
are rather modest at 48 professionals. Personnel in the requisite number
would not be difficult to recruit; however, recruitment would have to be care-
fully planned by PIU to ensure timely hiring. Because the Project Director is
crucial to the success of the project, his appointment is a condition of
effectiveness of the ADB loan.
Procurement
44.       The civil works financed by IDA, totalling about US$1.1 million,
would individually be of small size (not likely to exceed US$200,000 equiva-
lent for any given location and year), spread over seven provinces, and phased
over a number of years. Consequently, they are unlikely to attract foreign
bidders and therefore would be carried out following local competitive bidding
in line with national bidding procedures acceptable to the Association.
Small-scale civil works, which may be in isolated locations where suitable
contractors are unavailable, would be carried out under force account. Pro-
curement of vehicles, as well as of equipment and materials costing US$300,000
or more per order, (expected to total about US$0.4 million) would be arranged
through international competitive bidding and international shopping in
accordance with IDA-s Guidelines on Procurement. In accordance with these
guidelines, domestic manufacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of
15Z or the existing customs duty and tax, whichever is lower, over the c.i.f.
price of competing imports. Before the commencement of procurement, the PIU
will furnish the ADB with a list of goods and equipment to be procured. Where
appropriate, equipment and supplies for the project will be ordered in bulk.
Minor items and materials would be obtained through local procurement
procedures. Consultants would be engaged in accordance with IDA-s guide-
lines. Goods and services for components financed by ADB and IFAD will be
procured according to their respective guidelines.



- 12 -
Disbursement
45.       IDA would reimburse expenditures on the following basis:
(1)  100% of expenditures on civil works, equipment and vehicles,
training, fellowships and consultant services; and
(2) staff salaries, operating and maintenance costs would be disbursed
at 90% through December 31, 1988, 70% in 1989 and 50% thereafter.
Credit proceeds would be released semi-annually on the basis of anticipated
expenditures during the forthcoming semester after adjusting for unspent funds
from the previous semester. Statements of expenditure, certified by the
Central Bank and the Project Director, would be used as the basis for with-
drawal from the credit. Withdrawal applications would be reviewed by ADB in
accordance with the terms of the Letter of Credit Admiaistration (para. 39).
Detailed documents supporting the statements of expenditure would be retained
by the PIU, and made available for inspection and review by supervision
missions.
Accounts, Audit and Reports
46.       The following reports will be furnished to ADB at the time intervals
indicated below:
(a)  Quarterly progress reports summarizing the status of the project and
the physical progress of construction, procurement, activities of
farmers and services rendered by the RDCs.
(b) Half-yearly reports summarizing the budgetary allocations and
expenditures, operations under ABD's Imprest Account and
expenditures incurred for IDA components.
(c)  A project completion report to be submitted within six months
following final disbursement under the credit.
The Government will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify the
goods and services financed out of the credit proceeds in accordance with gen-
erally accepted accounting principles. The executing agency will establish
and maintain separate accounts for expenditure on each major component of the
project. These accounts, including the statement of expenditures supporting
withdrawal applications, will be audited annually by an auditor acceptable to
IDA. The Government will submit to IDA an audit report, not later than six
months after the close of the fiscal year on the project accounts in such
detail as IDA may reasonably request.
Environmental Considerations
47.       Under current agricultural practices, increases in population and
declining land resources would accelerate the rotation of food gardens and
bush fallow, exposing land more frequently to erosion risks. The Project will
gradually replace the wasteful subsistence rotation with improved agricultural
practices and will encourage establishment of perennial plantation crops as



- 13 -
permanent soil cover, leading to better land-use and erosion control. Ferti-
lizers and plant protection chemicals will be used only in small quantities
for tree crop establishment under the supervision of the extension service and
no environmental hazards are likely to result from their use.
Benefits
48.       The Project will assist the Government's efforts to accelerate and
diversify smaliholder agricultural development by consolidating and improving
the key agricultural support services of research, extension, training and
infrastructure. Benefits would accrue to some 9,000 smallholders spread
throughout the country, who grow primarily coconut and food crops.
49.       The main benefits expected from the project are:  (a) increased
benefits from investment in research; (b) an increase in cost effectiveness
and operating efficiency of government services; (c) greater availability of
suitably trained manpower; (d) increased participation of the smallholders in
the cash economy; (e) expansion and diversification of agricultural production
and exports; (f) increased foreign exchange earnings and government revenue as
a result of export taxation; and (g) improved off-farm skills which would
enable the rural people to establish and operate small rural enterprises.
Justification
50.       The agricultural sector in the Solomon Islands is performing below
its potential because the existing support services are weak, facilities are
meagre, and the staff training insufficient. Unless a determined effort is
made to strengthen them, whatever little exists at present, may eventually
cease functioning except in a narrow administrative and regulatory role. The
project is mainly justified on the basis of its aims to revitalize the agri-
culture sector by expanding the production base, boosting the market acti-
vities and training the rural people in off-fanm skills for the purpose of
raising their income level and their standard of living.
Risks
51.       Uncertainties relate to project implementation itself.  The proposed
project would require considerable input of specialized staff, a careful tim-
ing of budgeting, staff recruitment and other administrative procedures. The
Government is fully conscious of the difficulties of this task and is taking
suitable measures. Furthermore, the PIU has been established to minimize
these risks. Land acquisition is often a problem, so steps have been under-
taken to obtain the ownership of proposed sites in a timely way. Successful
implementation of the project also requires close coordination between the
central and provincial services. This applies particularly to the research/
extension linkage which even in the best circumstances is a demanding task.
It is therefore proposed that the coordination and proper delineation of
powers and functions between the Central and Provincial authorities be given
continuous attention during supervision and during the monitoring and
evaluation process.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Solomon Islands
and IDA and the Recommendation provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the
Articles of Agreement of the Association are being distributed separately to
the Executive Directors. Special conditions of effectiveness are (i) that all
conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the ADB loan have been fulfilled;
and (ii) that all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the ADB
technical assistance grant have been fulfilled (para. 39).
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
