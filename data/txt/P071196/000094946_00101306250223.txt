I.   STATUS OF THE POWER SECTOR
Physical Characteristics of the Power System
1.   Hydropower Plants. Kenya's interconnected power system has an installed
generation capacity of 1,03 1MW of which 705 MW is hydro, 327MW is thermal, and
0.4MW is wind. A further 30MW is imported from Uganda. In addition to the
interconnected system there are several isolated diesel power stations with an installed
capacity of 9.2MW. Table 1 below shows system's installed and effective generation
capacity.

2.    As is evident from the above statistics, the generation system is characterized by a
high level of dependence on hydro. Much of this generation is based on the Seven Forks
Hydro Stations which are located on the Tana River. These hydro plants operate in
cascade. Details of the plants (in order going down river) are shown below. All the
5



hydropower plants are owned and operated by the Kenya Electricity Generating
Company (KenGen)--a 100 percent government owned company.
Table 2: The Main Hydropower Plants
Name                                            Capacity (MW)
Masinga                                         2 x 20 MW
Kamburu                                         3 x 31.4 MW

1 x 80.25 MW
Kindaruma                                       2 x 20 MW
Kiambere                                        2 x 72 MW
3.    Thermal Plants. With the exception of two plants accounting for 87.5MW of
total installed capacity, the rest of the thermal power plants are also owned and operated
by KenGen. The steam power plant at Kipevu is unreliable, mainly due to the vintage of
the equipment. Unit 4 produces approximately 4MW at an efficiency of around 16%.
Turbine 7 is currently being fed by boiler 6. Turbine 6 has a crack in the casing, and
boiler 7 is not operational following an explosion in the boiler in April. This explosion
caused considerable damage to the side walls and the superheater tubing. It is proposed
to rehabilitate this unit as part of the Government of Kenya's (GoK) emergency power
supply plan.
4.    Power transmission and distribution is currently the sole responsibility of the
Kenya Power and Lighting Company (KPLC), a publicly listed company which is
nevertheless effectively under the control of the Government as majority shareholder.
Although the Electric Power Act (1997) does not preclude generators from selling to
other parties, until now, KPLC remains the sole purchaser of electricity from KenGen
and all independent power producers (IPPs) operating in the country. KPLC's probem
areas include high system losses (about 19 percent), and a customer staff ratio of 75:1
which is considered low in relation to the company's level of operations. The system
losses are high in relation to past years (about 15.2 percent in 1993/94, 15.6 percent in
1994/95, etc) and in relation to system characteristics. The increases in recent years can
be attributed to natural load growth, the need to transport power from the Coast over
longer distances to Western Kenya in the current drought conditions, and to a possible
sharp rise in non-technical losses partly because of falling consumer incomes. The high
system losses, and overstaffing combined with reduced sales revenues arising from the
drought-induced power rationing have adversely affected KPLC's overall liquidity
position. This in turn has affected KenGen's liquidity as KPLC honors its obligations
under PPAs with IPPs. This has made it difficult for KenGen to afford fuel purchases for
its power plants under the current drought conditions. Therefore, prior to disbursement
of this credit, agreement will be required between the Bank and the Governemnt on an
action plan for restructuring of KPLC within 6-9 months.

Status of Power Sector Reforms
5.    Since the mid-I 990s, Kenya has made significant progress in raising energy
prices, restructuring the power sector, opening the power generation market to private
investment, and reforming the sector's legal and regulatory environment. The sector
reform program was developed under the ongoing multi-donor funded Energy Sector
Reform and Power Development Project (ESRPP) -- Cr. 2966-KE. Specific progress
achieved under the reform program includes: (i) unbundling of power generation
activities on one hand, and transmission and distribution activities on the other hand and
their placement in separate commercially-operated businesses; (ii) elimination of
government subsidies to the sector, with the exception of those to the rural electrification
program; (iii) enactment in 1998 of enabling legislation for private sector participation
and for the establishment of the Electricity Regulatory Board (ERB); and (iv) increase in
the private sector's share of the generation market from zero to the current 10 percent,
with a further increase to about 25 percent expected in 2001 when about 130MW in new
installed capacity will be commissioned and operated by the private sector. The World
Bank Group has coordinated its support for private sector development in Kenya's power
market; IDA through support for policy reforms and preparation of the projects under the
ESRPP; IFC through financing of the Kipevu II Power Plant; and MIGA through
insurance for the Olkaria III Power Plant. In addition to these reforms, the GoK has
confirmed, under the recently approved Economic and Public Sector Reform Credit, its
intention to restructure KPLC into a competitive power transmission and distribution
market prior to privatization of its distribution activities in 18-24 months.
6.    The progress in implementing the reform program came only after several years
of protracted dialogue between the Government and donors. Thus, between the late
1 980s and the mid 1 990s, donors could not agree to finance new investments in the
absence of a move toward economic pricing of electricity and petroleum products, and
without opening the sector to private sector participation and improvements in the
governance framework for the sector. At the same time the low pricing for electricity
meant that the sector could not generate adequate resources for investment. Such funding
as was available from the sector, or was provided from the central government budget
was used ineffectively. Most donors suspended aid to the sector. In early 1994, the GoK
agreed with the Bank on a comprehensive reform program. Subsequently,
implementation of the various measures, some of which were important triggers for the
Bank's processing of the ESRPP lagged considerably behind schedule with the result that
it was only three years later (1997) that IDA was able to present the ESRPP to its Board.
Soon thereafter, the GoK failed to meet IMF conditions for an ESAP leading to delays in
processing of co-financing, and modifications to the negotiated agreement for the Bank
Credit. The Credit agreements were subsequently signed about a year after Board
presentation and became effective on June 23, 1998.
7.    At the time of Board Presentation of the ESRPP in 1997, seven power plants for a
total capacity of 460MW were expected to be commissioned during the period 1998-
2000. Table 3 shows that only 147MW of this capacity has been commissioned and
gives the revised dates for the rest.

8.    The considerable delays in the implementation of the above plants are due to a
combination of factors, the most important of which are: (i) protracted negotiations
between KPLC, IPPs, financiers and GOK; (ii) delayed credit effectiveness; and
(iii) slow pace of restructuring in the sector. For the private sector funded projects,
considerable time was spent negotiating the power purchase agreements and related
security arrangements for payments and on reaching financial closure. Similar delays are
being experienced in the negotiations of the 11 OMW (now expected to be reduced to
55MW) fast track units which are scheduled for commissioning by mid next year.
9.    Thus, the delays in reaching agreement with donors on a reform program for the
sector and the slow implementation of the sector investment program once agreement had
been reached with donors combined with the drought in the last three rain seasons has led
to the current power supply crisis. Had the investment program been implemented as
scheduled the 67 percent in hydropower production could have been compensated for
through thermal production.
10.   An extensive load shedding program has had to be introduced such that domestic
consumers receive power supply for about 15 hours/day and industrial consumers for
eight hours on alternate days. The economic costs of unmet demand are estimated at
US$400-630 million for the next nine months (until the long rains in April 2001), or
equivalent to 3.8 - 6.5 percent of GDP.
11.   Apart from drastically reduced power production, the drought has also caused
serious shortages of water, substantial decreases in crop production, and livestock losses.
Secondary effects are being felt in the poor performance of the manufacturing,
' The capacity was subsequently revised to I I OMW on the basis of an update of the least-cost
expansion plan carried out by ACRES. When the decision was taken in 1998 to proceed with
implementation of this capacity, the expected commissioning date was mid 1999, but the revised
commissioning date in now August 2001.

of the ESRPP.

construction and service industries, and of the informal sector. Most vulnerable are the
pastoral and small-scale agriculture-dependent populations in the country's arid and
semi-arid areas. Before the extent of the failure of the March-May, 2000 long rain season
was fully recognized, GDP growth was expected to grow by about 2.5 percent in 2000
rising to 5 percent in 2003. This gradual pace of economic recovery was predicated on
maintenance of fiscal and financial stability, structural reforms and rehabilitation of
infrastructure. However, the severe drought in early 2000 is expected to result in
negative output growth in most key sectors of the economy, particularly agriculture,
power, and manufacturing. Thus, preliminary revised estimates now indicate that the
GDP growth rate for 2000 would be a negative 0.4 percent, down from 2.5 percent.
II.      THE DROUGHT
12.   Kenya has experienced severe droughts in four out of the last ten years (1991/92,
1996/97, 1998/99 and 1999/00) and heavy flooding in 1997/98. Kenya normally receives
concentrated rain falls during March-May (long rains) and October-December (short
rains), and intermittent rains at other times. The long rains for 1999 were sporadic,
poorly distributed and averaged less than the mean at most of the monitoring stations in
the eastern, central, coastal and Rift Valley areas. The short rains which were expected at
the beginning of October 1999 were delayed by approximately three weeks, and poorly
distributed during much of November. The drought hit hardest during the March-May
2000 long rain season. With the exception of Western and Nyanza provinces which
received significant amounts of rainfall, the rest of the country received between 30 and
50 percent of the long-term average precipitation.
13.   Rainfall data (Table 4a) collected at the power stations indicate that while the
1999 rains were generally below long-term averages, in year 2000 the long rains were
below 50% in almost all cases, and were sometimes as low as 13%. Table 4(b) provides
data on river inflows at the Masinga Reservoir, the uppermost and largest of the
reservoirs on the Tana River. It can be seen that the substantially lower inflows during
the past three rain seasons mirror the low rainfall data (Table 4(a)) during the same
period.

Impact of Drought on the Power Sector
14.    Power Production. As noted earlier, under average hydrological conditions,
Kenya depends on hydro for about 70% of power supply. Power plants accounting for
almost all the hydro capacity are on the Tana river which flows from the Aberdare Range
through Central, Eastern, North Eastern and Coastal districts of Muranga, Embu/Mbeere,
Kirinyaga, Meru, Garissa, Tana River and Lamu to the Indian Ocean. By November
1999, the drought conditions had resulted in low water levels in the main reservoirs on
the Tana river and KPLC initiated a program of load shedding in consultation with the
key stakeholders. A decision to procure emergency equipment was shelved in
anticipation of good rains during the March-May 2000 rain season. When the expected
rains failed, to optimize on the available water until the next rains (October-December
2000), hydropower production was reduced by about 30% by April 2000 and by 70% in
June 2000.
15.    Energy and Demand Balances. The projected energy and capacity balances for
fiscal year 2000/01 are shown in Attachments 1 and 2 respectively. Energy shortfalls
amounted to 114GWh and 148 GWh in July and August 2000 respectively. These
shortfalls corresponded to capacity deficits of 264MW and 272MW respectively. When
the Government's emergency power plan is taken into account (paras 26-27) the
shortfalls decline to 82GWh in September, and 22GWh in October, before
demand/supply balance is achieved in December 2000. The energy balances incorporate
increases in power imports from Uganda from 12GWh in May to 25 GWh in July and
33GWh in August. For the rest of the fiscal year to June 30, 200 1,the critical assumptions
are (i) the reduction in imports from Uganda to about 9 GWh; (ii) river inflows of about
11



15 percent of the long-term average (LTA) during June-October 2000, 50 percent during
November 2000-March 2001 and 100 percent from April 2001 and thereafter; (iii) hydro
resources management would be optimized through full utilization of thermal generation
in the short term, and operating only "run of river" hydro plants during the night; and (iv)
improvement in coordination between KenGen and KPLC to avoid the current sub-
optimal dispatch of the hydro plants.
16.   The assumption that river inflows will be about 50 percent of LTA during
November 2000-March 2001 is predicated on adequate short rains being received in the
October-December 2000 short rains season. Similarly the assumption that river inflows
will be 100 percent of LTA from April 2001 onwards is based on at least average long-
term rains being received during March-May 2001. If either or both of these assumptions
do not apply, the energy shortfalls will continue. However, even if the rains are not
adequate, the expected commissioning in July/August 2001, of 130MW in additional
private sector generation capacity would ease the shortages.
17.   Program of Load Shedding. At present, the energy deficits are being managed
through a program of load shedding under which domestic consumers are receiving
supply for an average of 15 hours/day and industrial consumers for eight hours on
alternate days. The impact of the load shedding on industries, commercial activities
including tourism, hospitals and water supply as well as on domestic customers is severe.
The vibrant informal sector which provides substantial employment is being decimated
and poverty is increasing. Confidence in the power sector's performance is being eroded
and opportunities for foreign investment flows are being lost.
18.   Economic Costs of Unserved Energy. The economic costs of unmet demand3
are estimated at US$68 million per month. This is based on the projected monthly energy
deficit of 136GWh and on a unit cost of unserved energy of US$0.50/KWh. Without
emergency facilities the losses to the economy over the next nine months until the long
rains in April 2001 would amount to about US$400 million or about 3.8% of GDP. If the
estimated unit cost of unserved energy in Kenya of about US$0.79/KWh, according to
the 1993 Electricity Tariff Study is used, the total losses to the economy would be about
US$630 million, equivalent to about 6% of GDP. Implementation of the GoK's planned
emergency measures would reduce the costs of unserved energy from US$400 million to
US$120 million at US$0.50/kWh or from US$630 million to US$188 million at
US$0.79/kWh. The emergency measures are estimated to cost US$110 million.
Therefore, it is preferable for the Government to imrplement its proposed emergency
measures and avoid much higher costs of unserved energy.
19.   Sector's Financial Performance. Whereas power sales to final consumers were
estimated to increase by about 7.3% in FY1999/00 compared to FY1998/99, preliminary
figures indicate a decline of about 8.1% in relation to FY1998/99 or 14.4% below
budgeted level. The decline in sales is due primarily to the production constraints caused
by drought. The decrease in sales has led to a substantial reduction in KPLC's sales
3 The cost of unmet demand or unserved energy represents the incremental cost of using
substitutes ( e.g kerosene, LPG) and/or the cost of lost production as a result of failure to meet
demand through the provision of electricity or its substitutes.
12



revenue. The power shortages also have meant that a higher proportion of domestic
consumption is now taking place in the lower tariff block, again leading to loss of
revenues for KPLC. These revenue losses have been compounded by the shifting of
consumption to off-peak periods by large customers following the introduction last year
of peak and off-peak pricing. Also, the need to transport power from the Coast over
longer distances to Western Kenya has meant higher transmission losses, further
contributing to KPLC's financial losses. The reduced revenues have worsened KPLC's
liquidity position, which in turn affects that of KenGen as KPLC is the only purchaser of
KenGen's output.
Impact of Drought on Other Sectors
20.  With the exception of transport, most sectors are expected to register negative
growth rates in year 2000 because of the drought. As noted earlier, this contraction is
expected to reduce the overall GDP growth rate to a negative 0.4 percent compared to the
previous estimate of 2.5 percent.
21.   Agriculture. Production of most crops, livestock and livestock products is
expected to decline below the 1999 levels. Year 2000 long rains maize production is
forecast at 19 million bags, which is 26 percent less than the 1999 long rains harvest, and
37 percent below the normal average. Among the principal crops, only coffee-a crop
that normally performs well in less precipitation--is expected to fare better. Prolonged
drought has also resulted in cumulative livestock losses, falling livestock prices and
sharply rising cereal prices.
22.   Manufacturing. Overall manufacturing output is expected to shrink further from
the one percent growth recorded in 1999 to negative growth in 2000. The sector will be
adversely affected by the power and water shortages, and food processing in particular
will be affected by grain shortages. The impact of grain shortages may, to some extent, be
offset by the imports of grains and other raw materials, if millers take advantage of the
recent reduction in maize import tariffs. Nevertheless, production costs are likely to rise
significantly as firms struggle to meet their fixed overheads and to maintain profit
margins. This will translate into higher consumer prices, which may lead to less demand.
23.   Petroleum Fuels. The consumption of petroleum fuels by the agriculture sector
decreased by about 12 percent in the first half of year 2000, but increased by about 6
percent in the Industrial and Commercial sectors and by 32 percent in the power sector.
The large increases were due to the substantial switch, by both KenGen and private
generators, to thermal power production as hydropower supplies declined.
24.   Others. Electric power rationing has also aggravated the water supply situation,
because of the lack of electrical power for water pumping. The sector is expected to
record a drop of 3% in real value added. The shortage of clean water may, in the long
run, lead to serious outbreaks of water-borne epidemics like cholera. The building and
construction sector is also showing signs of stress due to the overall economic situation.
On the other hand, the transport sector has received a boost because of the need to
transport increased imports of food, fuel and power supply equipment. The sector is
expected to grow by 1.5 percent.

III.    THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE TO THE DROUGHT
25.   In May 2000, the GoK issued a paper entitled: "Kenya Government Appeal for
Local and Intemational Assistance to Combat the Current Drought Stress." The
document describes the effects of the drought on the social sectors (food, health and
nutrition and education), infrastructure (water and sanitation) and agriculture, and
summarizes the financial requirements to implement the Government's proposed
recovery plan. The plan comprises: (i) food assistance for about 3.34 million affected
people in the north-eastern, eastem and Rift Valley areas; (ii) repairs and maintenance of
boreholes and supply of tank water to affected communities; (iii) preventive and curative
health care, particularly for the most vulnerable groups (pregnant women and children);
(iv) provision of essential agricultural inputs to about 103,000 affected small scale
agricultural households, and (v) rehabilitation of water supply points. Table 5 below
shows the estimated financial requirements for implementation of these drought recovery
measures.
26.   In June, the Government asked the Bank for support in addressing the impact of
the drought on the power crisis, water supply and agriculture. A specific plan for
addressing the power crisis which had been approved by Cabinet was presented to the
Bank. It comprised the following package of measures: (i) mobilizing privately-owned
generating capacity in the country, and providing, as incentives, tax exemptions on fuel
consumption and compensation for the excess of auto-generation costs over grid-based
costs of power; (ii) negotiating expansion of the generation facilities of independent
power producers already operating in the sector; (iii) rehabilitation of the retired 30MW
Kipevu Steam Power Plant at an estimated cost of about US$3.0 million; (iv) procuring
emergency diesel/gas turbine capacity of 99MW capacity for installation, operation and
maintenance by independent power producers on short-term contract basis (6 months);
(v) procurement of a 45MW capacity diesel plant at a cost of about US$19 million; and
duties and taxes exemptions for power generation equipment and fuel purchased under
the power supply emergency program.

The number of people at risk has since been revised to 4.7 million based on the poor harvests in the most affected regions.
Energy financing requirements are estimated to the end of the fiscal year, i.e. June 30, 2001.

27.   The Government's emergency program was reviewed during the preparation/pre-
appraisal/appraisal mission for the project. After taking into account the revised river
inflow data and opportunities for maximizing utilization of water resource, the additional
capacity requirement was revised from 196MW to 17 1MW. Table 6 below shows the
revised emergency power supply plan. The plan which has been agreed with the
Government excludes acquisition of new public sector units. Under the plan the
Government will also exempt fuel for emergency generation capacity (i.e. autogenerators,
expanded private sector generation capacity, the rehabilitated Kipevu Steam Power Plant
and the IPP facilities ) from all taxes and duties except for the petroleum development
and road maintenance levies.

IV.      IDA'S RESPONSE TO THE DROUGHT
28.   After reviewing its existing portfolio of projects in Kenya, the Bank concluded
that the Government's request for assistance to the agricultural sector could be met
through amendments to the ongoing Arid Lands Resources Management Project (Cr.
2797-KE). Thus, the amendment to the Development Credit Agreement will allow for
establishment and maintenance of a Drought Contingency Fund to be used for financing
immediate drought mitigation interventions detailed in district drought contingency plans,
such as emergency livestock offtake, food for work programs, support to schools, and
repairs and maintenance of water supplies.
29.   A review of the ongoing ESRPP (Cr. 2966-KE) indicated that, with the recent
award of the two large contracts for Olkaria Geothermal Power Plant, the credit has
become substantially fully committed. Only a small amount (US$2 million) will be used
from the Credit to finance consultants services for preparation of this project and to
finance transformers and other equipment needed for connection of the proposed IPPs'
generation units to KPLC's system. It was therefore decided to prepare a stand alone
operation, on an emergency basis, to help co-finance the GoK's plan for addressing the
crisis. A preparation/pre-appraisal mission visited Kenya during June 21-July 6, 2000.
The mission was subsequently upgraded to appraisal status.
Lessons Learned
30.   In designing this operation, the team reviewed recent Bank experience in the
preparation of emergency projects in other countries, particularly, the region's recent
experience in Mozambique and Madagascar. The team also noted the following relevant
15



recommendations from recent internal publications: (i) speed of both
preparation/appraisal and implementation is crucial for success; (ii) the simpler the
design the better; (iii) the institutional framework, and strategic management of an
emergency is crucial for project success; (iv) mitigation measures should always be
included against repeat disasters; and (v) procurement needs to be flexible, and
procurement management needs to start early. These lessons have been fully
incorporated through a simple project design with a few contracts, rapid
preparation/appraisal, completion of the contracting from advertising for bids to contract
award within about 4 weeks, and strategic program oversight from the highest levels of
government. The team also consulted widely within and outside the Africa region to
benefit from the best available expertise on design of emergency operations.
31.   Mitigation Measures. To avoid repeat disasters, the project design includes
several features. First, the project includes fast-tracking of the planned restructuring and
privatization of KPLC so as to create an efficient transmission and distribution business--
a financially strong power sector will be better able to withstand future droughts without
recourse to government subsidies. Apart from strengthening the financial soundness of
the sector, the restructuring will seek to improve the sector's technical and managerial
competencies for implementation of the sector investment programs, slow
implementation of which has substantially contributed to the current power crisis
(para.6). Second, to cushion the country from prolonged power shortages, careful
monitoring of planned private sector generation capacity additions due to be delivered by
mid-next year will be required. Of the 130MW involved, financial closure has been
reached for 75MW while negotiations are still in progress for the balance of 55MW.
Given the slow pace of past negotiations with the private sector, the GoK is considering
possible options for speeding up the negotiations. Third, in parallel with the proposed
operation, the Government has indicated its intention to seek Bank support for
strengthening links of its power systems with other regional economies (Uganda,
Tanzania, SADC) so as to diversify its sources of power.
Rationale for IDA Involvement
32.   The last Bank Group's CAS was presented to the Board in September 1998. The
CAS is aimed at reducing poverty through sustainable broad-based growth. It focuses on
removal of systemic bottlenecks to economic growth, delivery of services and poverty
reduction, such as the malfunctioning of public institutions, poor public expenditure
management, and portfolio management. The Government's recent success (1998/99 and
1999/00) in achieving fiscal and financial stabilization and its renewed focus on civil
service reforms, improved public expenditure management, combating corruption, public
sector reform and privatization provides hope for improved economic growth rates in
2001-2003. However, as noted earlier, these prospects for growth have been endangered
by the severe drought. In this context shortages of power have emerged as a major
constraint to economic growth. In order to minimize the reduction in Kenya's growth
prospects, it is important that the country should have access to resources to enable
adequate supply of electricity to its key sectors of production. The proposed Emergency
Power Supply Project will contribute to this objective. The operation will provide
resources for the country to afford purchases of power supplies from IPPs without raising
tariffs to unaffordable levels. On average, the current power tariffs are above the long
16



run marginal cost of supply, and collection of trade receivables has become a major
problem, partly because of non-affordability reasons in the present difficult economic
conditions. The project will also provide incremental working capital requirements
needed to manage the shift from hydro towards more thermal power production brought
about by the drought.
33.   A further justification for the proposed project is that, by enabling the recently
restructured sector to fully utilize its thermal generation, and its transmission and
distribution assets, it will help to maintain the benefits of the reforms. The drought and
the dialogue during the course of the project preparation has sensitized senior government
officials on the need for speedier reforms of KPLC and for increasing regional links to
facilitate exchange of power. The operation has been prepared in accordance with the
Bank's Operational Policies/Bank Procedures No. 8.50 on Emergency Recovery
Assistance.
V.       THE PROPOSED EMERGENCY POWER SUPPLY PROJECT
Project Objectives
34.   The proposed project would assist the Government in implementing its
emergency measures to address the ongoing power supply crisis which is crippling
economic activities and hindering the delivery of social services. Specifically the project
would finance: (i) the Government's purchases of power and associated fuel from short-
term independent power producers and fuel suppliers respectively for the projected
period of the power supply crisis; and (ii) working capital requirements for fuel purchases
arising from the drought-induced changes in generation mix between hydro and thermal
sources and from reduced revenues caused by load shedding.
Project Description
35.   The Emergency Power Supply Project will provide quick disbursing support to
finance a positive list of goods and services needed to urgently restore normal levels of
power supply to industrial, commercial and residential consumers, and to sustain
macroeconomic objectives. Specifically the project will provide assistance for financing:
(i) power purchases from facilities to be installed by IPPs at Embakasi (75MW) and
Ruaraka (30MW) in Nairobi6; (ii) fuel costs for operating the independent power
producers' plants for 6-7 months; and (iii) incremental fuel requirements for increased
operation of KenGen's thermal generation plants for a period of about three months
which is about the average time KPLC takes to recover the fuel costs from consumers.
6 Connection of the private sector plants to the power grid will be the responsibility of KPLC and
the required ancillary equipment, such as transformers and expansion of an existing substation at
Kipevu will be financed under the Energy Sector Reform and Power Development Project (Cr.
2966-KE) through a reallocation of the Credit.
17



Project Cost and Financing
36.   The total cost of the project is estimated at US$120.57 million excluding taxes,
duties and interest during construction, broken down by component as shown in Table 7
below. The size of the proposed credit, US$72 million, has been determined on the basis
of the crisis period ending in March-April 2001 when the long rains will be expected7.
About mid-2001, 130MW of private sector capacity will be added to the system provided
that implementation proceeds speedily for the Kipevu II Diesel Power Plant and
financing agreements are reached for fast track Eldoret plant (55MW). The total cost of
the electricity from the IPP plants over the crisis period is estimated at US$95.57 million
of which US$35.15 million will be payments for power to the IPPs and the balance of
US$60.42 million will be payments for the associated fuel to fuel suppliers. The net
revenues from the sale of power from these plants to the final consumers is estimated at
about US$48.57 millions. The IDA credit for the IPP component is calculated as the
difference between the total cost of the electricity to be supplied from the emergency
plants and the net revenue collections from final consumers, i.e. US$47 million, of which
costs US$30 million will be the credit's contribution to the cost of power and the balance
of US$17 million will be IDA financing for fuel costs. The Government's contribution
towards the financing of the power purchases and the associated fuel will be met from the
net revenue collections from final consumers. These net revenues will be deposited on a
monthly basis into an escrow account to be managed by the Emergency Power Technical
Team (EPTT). Attachment 3 provides estimates of the net revenues, payments to IPPs
and the balances of the escrow accounts. The revenue estimates include substantial
allowances for KPLC's transmission and distribution costs (US$0.03/KWh) and for bad
debts (5%). They also take into account KPLC's current weak collection performance.
They are therefore very conservative and should be realizable to provide the counterpart
funding required for the project. Nevertheless, it will be important for the EPTT to
carefully monitor KPLC collections and banking of the net revenues into the project's
escrow account.

7A provision has been made for two months additional financing for theIPPs to cover the risk of
below average rains during the April-May 2001 season, pending commissioning of the Kipevu II
Diesel Power Plant in July 2001
8 The net revenues were calculated on the basis of the existing tariffs approved by the ERB,
including the indexation of the fuel tariff for changes in fuel prices and exchange rates. The net
revenue equals gross billings less KPLC's T&D costs less provision for doubtful debts.
18



37.   The balance of the proposed credit, US$25 million, is the fuel costs requirement
for three months for KenGen's existing thermal power plants. About two months after
billing is KPLC's current collection period for revenues from consumers. Although the
target collection period is 60 days or less, KPLC is experiencing collection delays,
mainly because of the current macroeconomic stress, but also due to customer
management problems.
38.   The IPPs were selected on the basis of a competitive bidding process. Following
an advertisement, fifteen bids were received, of which four were found responsive. The
capacity costs offered by the four bidders ranged from US$0.056/kWh to US$0.112/kWh.
The Govemment invited for negotiation three of the bidders with the lowest evaluated
prices and whose cumulative offered capacity amounted to the required 105MW. Thus
the capacity costs for the three IPPs with whom the GoK has signed capacity purchase
agreements range from US$0.056/kWh to US$0.088/kWh.
39.   Fuel costs are estimated at US$0.108/kWh for two of the IPPs and
US$0.098/kWh for the third IPP. The average overall cost of the power from IPPs is thus
estimated at about US$0.17/kWh which compares to the average retail tariff of
US$0.092/kWh, hence the need to provide the differential between the net revenue
collections from consumers and the costs of the power as a Government subsidy. The
fuel costs used to determine the cost per kWh of electricity are high because they include:
(i) inland transportation costs to the project sites; and (ii) costs of on-site storage facilities
to be installed by the fuel suppliers. It is important to note, however, that the fuel
component of the cost of power from the IPP plants will be based on actual costs incurred
by the Government through a competitive bidding process(para.50).
40.   The high cost of the fuel component of the cost of power from the IPP plants and
the reasons for that has been noted above. With regard to the capacity costs, it is likely
that the short duration of the contracts (six months), and negative investor perception of
Kenya's power sector contributed to the high prices.
41.   Schedule A'in the MOP shows a positive list of items to be financed from the
proposed credit. The project would finance 100 percent of the electric power purchases
from IPPs and of the petroleum and petroleum products costs, excluding import duties,
taxes and levies. A summary of the proposed procurement and disbursement
arrangements is shown in Schedule B of the MOP. Consistent with the emergency nature
of the proposed support, these arrangements have been simplified to the maximum extent
feasible, while seeking to ensure that overall concerns about due diligence and
transparency are addressed.
Project Implementation and Contractual Framework
42.  Project implementation arrangements have been designed to address specific
concerns about transparency, ensure safeguarding of the fiduciary responsibilities of the
Bank, while simultaneously ensuring that the project would be implemented speedily in
line with the requirements. Further, the project implementation design is intended to
ensure that the credit proceeds would be used solely to finance the costs of the goods and
services on the positive list that are required to address the problem of critical power
19



shortages; that required procurement, accounting and auditing procedures are followed;
and that appropriate retention of documents is provided to allow for IDA supervision and
for independent audits.
43.  Project Organization. The project is being implemented by the Office of the
President (OP) with the assistance of the Ministries of Energy and Finance and Planning,
KenGen, KPLC and IPPs. A project organization and contractual framework chart is
shown in Attachment 4. The chart outlines the relationships between the parties and the
agreements that are needed to define the duties and responsibilities of each party.
44.   The OP, through the Emergency Electricity Coordinating Committee (EECC),
chaired by Minister for Finance and co-chaired by the Permanent Secretary, Secretary to
the Cabinet and Head of the Public Service has oversight responsibility over the
implementation of the project; approves decisions on selection of IPPs on the basis of
recommendations from an Emergency Power Technical Team (EPTT); and takes
decisions on any issues that may impede or threaten to impede project implementation.
45.   The Government has appointed an eminent Kenyan with an extensive and
successful track record in management, to chair the EPTT. This is a part-time position.
The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Energy, has appointed a deputy chairman from the
Implementation Support Group (ISG) for the ESRPP to manage the EPTT on a day-to-
day basis. The EPTT also includes the following experts: (i) technical and legal
consultants financed under the ESRPP; (ii) one expert selected by MoE from each of
KPLC and KenGen and assigned to the EPTT on a secondment basis; (iii) two staff
seconded from the Electricity Regulatory Board and from the Ministry of Finance and
Planning; and (iv) two ISG consultants (Economist, Technical Adviser- engineering and
procurement), who are providing the secretariat to the EPTT.
46.   The terms of reference for the EPTT are shown in Attachment 5. The principal
functions of the EPTT are as follows: (i) invitation and evaluation of proposals from
prospective IPPs; (ii) submission of recommendation for selection of developers to the
EECC; (iii) negotiation of contracts and preparation of final contracts; (iv) monitoring
installation of the connection facilities for temporary private power, metering and billing
arrangements; (v) authorizing and processing requests for payments to IPPs to be made
through the Project and Escrow Accounts; (vi) organization of monthly audits of the
Special and Escrow Accounts and reports, preparation and submission of project status
reports to the EECC, MoF, MoE and IDA.
47.   The external consultants to the EPTT will be retained until completion of
negotiations for award of contracts to IPPs. The seconded staff from KPLC, KenGen and
ERB will remain in place, until the completion of the project. A legal notice was issued
on August 2, 2000 by the Minister for Energy spelling out the composition,
responsibilities and duties of the EECC and the EPTT.
48.   Project Contractual Framework. In addition to the Development Credit
Agreement between the International Development Association and the GoK, and the
Project Agreement between IDA, the GoK, KPLC and KenGen, the contractual
framework for the project comprises, the following other agreements: (i) Capacity
20



Purchase (Power Purchase) Agreement between the GoK and each of the IPPs, (ii)
Capacity Lease Agreement between the GoK and KenGen; (iii) Support Services
Agreement between KenGen, KPLC and IPP; (iv) Supplemental Agreement to the
Interim PPA between KPLC and KenGen; and (v) a Revenue and Escrow Account
Agreement between the GoK and KPLC.
49.   The contractual framework recognizes that the GoK will borrow from IDA under
the DCA, purchase capacity from IPPs, but since the GoK is not a licensed generator, it
will lease the capacity to KenGen; KenGen will enter into a tripartite support services
agreement with the IPP and KPLC so as to allow the IPP to operate, maintain and feed
the electricity into KPLC's grid. Outlines of the capacity (power) purchase, capacity
lease and support services agreements are given in the draft project implementation
manual.
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
50.   Procurement: The project will finance power purchases from IPPs and the
associated fuel for running these plants as well as incremental fuel requirements for
increased operation of KenGen's thermal generation plants for a period of about three
months. The IPPs have been selected on a competitive basis using procedures agreed
with the Bank (i.e. simplified international competitive bidding procedures under clauses
2.63 and 2.64 of IDA's Procurement Guidelines). These procedures consisted of public
advertisement of a request for proposals/bids, evaluation of bids by a special private
sector-led tearn assisted by independent consultants. The request for proposals/bids, bid
evaluation reports and draft negotiated contracts were cleared by the Bank as part of the
prior review procedures.
51.   Procedures for procurement of fuel have been agreed with the Government taking
into account the need to ensure that fuel deliveries to the emergency power plants will
take place no later than the commissioning dates for those plants. Thus, limited
international bidding procedures (LIB) will be used to procure fuel requirements for the
first six weeks. The project team is satisfied that there are enough local oil marketing
companies to ensure a competitive procurement process. ICB procedures will be used for
(i) the balance of the fuel requirements for the emergency plants (allowing fifteen days
bidding period with publication in the local newspapers and distribution of the Notice of
Invitation to Bid to the Embassies and Trade Representatives); and (ii) the incremental
fuel requirements for increased operation of KenGen's thermal generation plants in
Mombasa (with the required publication in the UNDB and local newspapers, but with a 4
week bidding period).
52.   The IDA credit will finance the cost of fuel at the delivery points (project sites for
the emergency plants and CIF Mombassa for KenGen's thernal generation plants in
Mombasa) excluding any applicable duties, taxes and levies.
Disbursements
53.   Special Accounts. The portion of the credit to be used for financing the costs of
power purchases from IPP plants will be disbursed over about six months through Special
Account A on a replenishment basis. The Authorized Allocation to Special account A
will be US$10 million. To expedite processing of replenishment withdrawal
21



applications and to ensure timely payments to IPPs, IDA has agreed on an exceptional
basis, to process these replenishment applications on the basis of a faxed copy of the
application, upon confirmation by the Country Director for Kenya of his receipt of the
original copy of the application which will be sent by Pouch to the Loan Department.
The payments for fuel estimated at US$42 million would be disbursed through Special
account B. The Authorized Allocation to Special Account B would also be US$10
million. Expenditures qualifying for retroactive financing would be released upon receipt
of a withdrawal application following credit effectiveness.
54.   Payments for power purchases from IPPs will be made out of Special Account A.
The payments from this account to the IPPs will be made on a monthly basis for about
four (4) months, the estimated period during which the IDA funds earmarked for the
purchase of electricity will be exhausted and after which escrowed net revenues will be
disbursed to pay the IPPs.
55.   The procurement of the fuel for existing thermal power plants will be carried out
by KenGen under the supervision of the EPTT so as to ensure use of agreed procurement
procedures. KenGen will process invoices and effect payments for fuel supplies to the
power plants.
56.   Escrow Accounts: A separate escrow account will be established and maintained
by the Ministry for Finance and Planning in Kenya shillings in a local commercial bank.
All net revenue collections from consumers by KPLC from the sales of energy supplied
by the IPPs during the emergency period will be deposited in the escrow account within
sixty days of billing. Once the credit proceeds in the special account A are exhausted,
after about four (4) months of electricity generation by the IPPs, the escrow account is
then used to pay the costs of power purchases from the IPPs until the expiration of the
contracts period. The escrow account will also be used to finance the fuel for the IPP
plants. The Ministry of Finance and Planning will authorize the EPTT to process and
effect payments through the escrow account. The account will also be subjected to the
monthly audits as required for the project and special accounts.
Financial Management
57.   The EPTT will be responsible for financial management and procurement
responsibilities under the project. Accordingly, the management of the Special Accounts
(A and B), the Project accounts, and the Escrow account will be carried out by the EPTT
in accordance with sound and standard guidelines acceptable to the IDA. The EPTT will
thus be responsible for overseeing these Accounts, and verifying invoices and approving
payments. The EPTT will also prepare all financial management reports, financial
statements, payments requests and any other relevant financial documentation as required
by the Emergency Electricity Coordinating Committee and IDA. The EPTT will ensure
that the special accounts (initial deposits, subsequent transfer and payments therefrom),
and the escrow account are audited as required. The EPTT will also ensure that
contracting, procurement, disbursement and financial management functions required
under this project are carried out efficiently. All necessary documentation supporting
Project related disbursement and financial transactions will be maintained by the EPTT
for inspection by IDA supervision missions, Governrment, and the independent auditors.
22



58.   Financial Audit. It has been agreed that the proposed project financial
statements (including the Escrow and Special Accounts) will be audited on a monthly
basis by an independent public accounting firm with relevant experience and competence
acceptable to IDA. Project accounts will be maintained by the EPTT which will provide
the EECC, MOE, MOF, and the IDA with timely management information on the
execution of the project and help ensure accountability and transparency. The monthly
audit reports will be sent to the IDA not later than 30 days after the end of the month.
Draft terms of reference for the monthly audits are included in Attachment 6.
Retroactive Financing
59.   The credit will provide for retroactive financing in the amount of US$14.4 million
equivalent, 20% of the proposed credit amount, to finance expenditures incurred before
credit signing, but not earlier than May 15, 2000.
Agreements Reached During Negotiations
60.   During negotiations, agreements were reached that: (i) special and escrow
accounts audits would be carried out on a monthly basis by an independent auditor
acceptable to the Bank (para. 58); (ii) a project management structure, including an
Emergency Power Technical Team headed by an independent executive with a successful
management track record from outside Government would be retained (paras. 44-47); and
(iii) the flow of project funds, including the operation of special accounts A and B and a
project escrow account would take place as indicated in Attachment 7.
61.   The following will be conditions for Credit effectiveness: (i) the GoK will have
provided a legal opinion on the project's contractual framework documentation (paras. 47
and 48 ); (ii) the GoK will have opened the special, and escrow accounts indicated in
para. 55; (iii) the Subsidiary Financing Agreement between the Borrower and KenGen
will have been executed; and (iv) the GoK will have appointed auditors, acceptable to the
Association for the audit of the project accounts and the special and escrow accounts
(para. 58 ).
62.   As a condition for disbursement, the GOK will (i) submit an action plan,
satisfactory to the Association for restructuring KPLC; and (ii) issue a statement to the
public, consistent with the agreed action plan for restructuring KPLC.
Fiscal Impact of the Project
63.   On the expenditure side, the project's impacts arises from the net subsidy to the
consumers that will result from the differential between the net revenue collections and
the GoK payments to the IPPs (para. 3 5). The extent of this impact is equivalent to the
amount of the IDA credit for the financing of capacity and energy costs for the short-term
IPPs; i.e. US$47 million. Since the net revenue collections have been conservatively
estimated to cover the risks of below average rains, and KPLC's collection problems, it is
likely that some balances may remain after project completion. Any such balances
which would revert to the Treasury would in fact reduce the the level of GoK subsisdy to
23



consumers involved in this operation. On the revenue side, the project's impacts are: (i)
tax and duties exemptions for power generation equipment imported for the emergency
program; (ii) tax exemptions on fuel to be used for the expansion of existing IPP plants;
for the rehabilitated Kipevu Steam Power Plant and for the short-term IPPs. The duty
and tax exemptions on equipment will not result in revenue losses to the GOK in relation
to the current budget. More importantly, the project by providing needed power to
industrial and commercial enterprises, thereby allowing them to operate at normal/near
normal levels, will prevent substantial looses of tax revenues that would otherwise occur.
VI.      BENEFITS AND RISKS
Project Benefits
64.   The project has several benefits. First, by providing required power supplies to
industrial and commercial enterprises and to the informal operators, the project will help
to prevent loss of jobs. It will provide a check on the increases in poverty that would
otherwise take place. This is in addition to the fiscal impact mentioned above. The
drought has brought more awareness of the role of the sector in the economy and the need
to improve its the efficiency. The project will help Kenya to reform its transmission and
distribution system as a first step towards creating a more competitive and private sector
led system as agreed under the IPRSP and the Economic and Public Sector Reform
Credit. The drought and the dialogue during preparation of the project has also increased
Kenya's awareness of the vulnerability that arises from over-dependency on a single
source of power (hydro) and the benefits that could arise from interconnecting its power
system with the rest of the region, particularly with SADC countries.
Project Risks
65.   The project has the following principal risks: (i) the power shortages may continue
beyond April 2001, if the long rains fail to materialize on a required scale; (ii) KPLC may fail to
either fully collect revenues related to sale of power from emergency power plants or to bank all
such revenues into the project's escrow account (paras. 36 and 37); (iii) the possibility for
misappropriation of funds is a typical concern for emergency operations; and (iv) possible
coordination difficulties between KenGen, KPLC and IPPs leading to delays in the installation
of connection equipment for the emergency plants.
66.   The risk of prolonged power shortages in the event of continued drought would be
reduced through installation of 75MW private sector generation capacity for which financing
agreements have been completed, careful monitoring of the ongoing negotiations between
KPLC and IPPs for another 55MW expected to be commissioned by mid next year at Eldoret;
and expeditious restructuring of KPLC to make it more efficient. As the negotiations for the
55MW, have taken a considerable time to conclude, the GoK is considering options for
speeding up the negotiations with the IPPs.
67.   Since the power purchases and fuel contracts will be partly financed from the net
revenue collections from final consumers, if KPLC is unable to collect the full projected net
24



revenues required, the project would not be fully funded. An escrow account arrangement is
proposed together with careful independent monitoring of KPLC's collection and deposit of
revenues into the account. Further, the escrow account flows have been conservatively
estimated in order this and other risks, and any residual balances remaining at the end of the
project life would revert to the Treasury.
68.   Even with the drought, the power shortages would not have occurred had there been
more efficient management of the sector investment program and of transmission and
distribution business. Therefore, agreement has been reached with the GOK that as a condition
for disbursement, the GOK will submit to IDA a satisfactory action plan for fast tracking the
restructuring and privatization of KPLC. Also, as a condition for disbursement, the GoK will
issue a public statement, satisfactory to the Association, outlining its plan to restructure KPLC.
69.   The risks related to possible misappropriation of funds will be managed through
involvement of private sector leadership in the tendering process, monthly independent audits of
special project and escrow accounts and through third party verification of power sales into the
grid.
70.   Coordination between the KenGen, the IPPs and KPLC to ensure timely connection of
IPP units to the grid will be assured through IDA financing, under the ESRPP, of the required
equipment. KPLC will utilize equipment in stock and replace it with IDA financing.
