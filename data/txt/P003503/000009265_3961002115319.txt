MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPW3LIC OF CHINA
FOR THE ZOUXIAN THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the People's Republic of China to help finance the Zouxian Thermal Power Proj-
ect is submitted for approval. The loan for $310 million would be at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of 20 years, including
five years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent from the Gov-
ernment of China (GOC) through Skandong Province to the Shandong Provincial
Electric Power Bureau (SPEPB) with the same terms as the Bank loan.
2.        Backtround.  The shortage of electricity has become a major con-
straint to China's economic growth and improving the living standards of the
population. In many provinces, including Shandong where the proposed project
is located, customer demand exceses the available electricity supply by about
20 percent, and this shortage is likely to continue until the end of this
decade. The GOC has given high priority to electric power and its strategy is
to promote energy conservation, accelerate the pace of indigenous energy
resources development, construct large-scale, high efficiency and cost-
effective coal-fired thermal power plants, interconnect power systems through
extension of transmission networks, and replace obsolete and heavily polluting
plants with more efficient units. Moreover, improvements in energy effi-
ciency, fuel diversification, and larger scale of plants (which can support
more effective combustion controls) will all alleviate the onvironmental
impact of electric power growth.
3.        To strengthen the institutions in the power industry, the GOC has
initiated a number of actions to introduce modern energy technologies and
methods, improve energy efficiency and conservation, recognize environmental
consequences and mitigate adverse impacts, increase the financial and manage-
ment autonomy of power supply entities, and rationalize power pricing policy.
Particularly, GOC's "new plant, new price" policy guarantees debt servicing
for new power investments with the result that by the mid-1990s the average
price of electricity will approximate the long-run marginal cost of power
generation. The GOC also has recently announced its intention to gradually
unify the old and new system rates into single, more transparent, average
tariffs, and has taken concrete measures designed to eliminate gradually other
distortions associated with the outmoded structure of power tariffs. Under a
number of previous Bank projects and with the assistance of Bank staff, the
Chinese have done considerable work to evaluate the economic costs of electric
power with a view to refining the ongoing reform of the overall tariff level
and structure.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank's strategy in the energy
sector, and specifically the electric power subsector, is to support national
energy development and technology transfer, energy efficiency and conserva-
tion, and improved environmental management. Through both project and sector
work, the Bank seeks to encourage policies which provide appropriate incen-
tives for sustainable energy development and efficient energy use. The Bank
also seeks to promote modern management, and greater enterprise autonomy and
accountability.



S.        Bank participation in large and complex power projects, with a num-
ber of unique technical features, will particularly contribute to the optimal
development and use of hydropower and coal resources in China; it will also
support needed fuel diversification and the related reduction of atmospheric
pollution. The proposed project will encourage development of an efficient
power system and modern utility management; it will contribute to the intro-
duction of state-of-thb art power system planning, transfer of modern technol-
ogies, and extension of technical assistance and staff training. Institution
building will be another major objective for the Bank's participation in this
project as the beneficiary, Shandong Provincial Electric Power Bureau (SPEPB),
needs assistance in strengthening its organization and developing opera-
tionallfinancial capabilities. The Bank's sUP2ort will promote economic power
pricing in Shandong Province. An action plan for tariff structure improve-
ments will be implemented under the project.
6.        Proiect Obiectives.  The principal objectives of the project are to:
(i) alleviate the acute power shortage in Shandong Province; (ii) develop
large modern mine-mouth thermal power generating units to make effective use
of China's abundant coal resources; (iii) continue the effort to transfer the
appropriate advanced technology in plant design and project management for
600 MW thesmal power units; (iv) strengthen SPEPB's capabilities in the areas
of environmental planning for thermal power stations and improving the level
and structure of electricity tariffs; and (v) upgrade SPEPB's capability in
financial management, accounting and budgetary control, and in the operation
and maintenance of thermal power plants.
7.        Prolect Descrigtion.  The proposed project is located about 175 km
south of Jinan in Shandong Province. The project consists of: (i) the addi-
tion of two 600 MW generating units to the existing Zouxian thermal power
plant, to raise its total capacity to 2,40O MW; (ii) construction of 500 kV
and 220 kV transmission lines and substations; (iii) provision of consulting
services; (iv) provision of technical assistance to study the impact on air
quality of thermal power expansion programs and to develop methodologies for
selecting sites which minimize adverse environmental impacts in China's coas-
tal areas; (v) carrying out a tariff study and a phased, time-bound action
plan for improving Shandong's tariff structure; and (vi) a training program
for the technical, financial and management staff of SPEPB. Review by local
and expatriate engineering consultants confirmed that the design of the proj-
ect meets the highest standards and is entirely satisfactory in its overall
concept.
8.        Environmental Aspects.  A comprehensive environmental impact assess-
ment report has been prepared by the local consultants in accordance with
long-standing GOC environmental procedures for thermal power projects. The
report has been reviewed by the Bank and consultants and was found fully sat-
isfactory. The proposed project provides for technical assistance for a study
on air pollution control. This study is designed to develop guidelines and
methodologies for minimizing air pollution from thermal power plants sited in
coastal regions of China. The Japanese Grant Facility will be used to finance
the study. The contract was signed in July 1991 and the study work already
started.
9.        Proiect lunlementation.  Expatriate engineering consultants
(financed under Technical Cooperation Credit, 1664-CRA) will assist In prepar-
ing bidding documents, bid evaluation, including the preparation of bid evalu-



- 3 -
ation reports, and in interfacing engineering and design for different project
islands. The land needed for the power plant is already "-ailable and most of
the common facilities have been completed. A well-staffed construction unit
has been set up under SPEPB to supervise and coordinate the construction of
the project.   Bidding documents for major equipment are expected to be issued
in June 1992. The turbine-generator units will be procured through a joint
manufacturing agreement between Japanese and Chinese firms, which will facili-
tate technology transfer and promote the dev.lopment of local industries.
Commissioning of the first unit is scheduled tor December 1996, and the second
unit twelve months later.
10.       Proiecs Sustainability.  The institutional and financial sustainabi-
lity of the project will be enhanced by the planned strengthening of the bene-
ficiary's organizational structure, increased autonomy in managerial, procure-
ment, accounting and personnel matters, as well as the capability for debt
servicing and internal cash generation for self financing of future invest-
ments. Pricing of the project output will be devised in a manner to properly
reflect the costs and benefits of this project as well as its role ir. the
power grid. Furthermore, the current imperfections in power tariff structures
will be addressed and an action plan will be formulated to gradually eliminate
distortions in the provincial power   riff structure.
11.       Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement.  The lessons learned from
the previous power projects, particularly thermal power projects (Wujing,
Beilungang and Yanshi), have been taken into account in preparing the proposed
project. These lessons basically emphasize the importance of proper assess-
ment of project costs, appropriate technical and financial criteria, improving
and accelerating procurement procedures, enhancing the role of project manage-
ment, and the timely appointment of engineering consultants.
12.       Proiect Cost and Financing.  The total cost of the project is esti-
mated at $795.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of
$373.5 million (47 percent). Total financial requirements, including interest
during construction, amount to $957.4 million. The State Energy Investment
Corporation (SEIC) and Shandong Province would cover the financing of local
costs and interest during construction. A detailed breakdown of project costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. The project would be completed by June 30, 1998, and the closing
date of the Bank loan woule be June 30, 1999. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in China are given
in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map (IBRD No. 22046) is also attached.
The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 10432-CHA, dated March 24, 1992, is being dis-
tributed separately.
13.       Agreed Actions.  Major actions agreed with the GOC were that it
would: (i) onlend the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan through Shandong
Province to SPEPB with the sams terms as the Bank loan; and (ii) carry out the
study on air pollution controi in accordance with the terms of reference and
timing agreed with the Bank, and exchange views with the Bank on the progress
and findings of the study.
14.       Assurances also were obtained from SPEPB that it would:  (i) carry
out the tariff study and an action plan for the Shandong power system as
agreed with the Bank; (ii) take measures, including but not limited to



- 4 -
increasing its tariffs, to ensure that it earns a net cash surplus sufficient
to meet a minimum of 25 percent of its annual investment program during
1993194 and 30 percent thereafter; (iii) maintain a debt/equity ratio of no
more than 75!25 from 1992 to 1996, and 70/30 thereafter; (iv) maintain a debt
service coverage of no less than 1.4 timest (v) furnish each year to the Bank,
by April 30 of each year commencing in 1993, a rolling eight-year financial
plan containing projected income statements, statements of sources and uses of
funds, and balance sheets; (vi) incorporate all recommended mitigating mea-
sures identified in the environmental impact statement intj the project
design; (vii) take all the necessary steps to implement the environmental
monitoring program agreed with the Bank; and (viii) carry out relocation of
persons affected by the project in accordance with a plan acceptable to the
Bank.
15.       Prolect Benefits.  The project will greatly increase the generating
capability of the Shandong power system. An economic analysis of the project,
based on optimizing the power system has confirmed that there are no better
alternatives than the proposed project for meeting future power demand. The
extension of the existing Zouxian power station provides the most cost-effec-
tive and efficient method of augmenting power system generating capacity in
Shandong Province. The developiment of the project vill also enhance indus-
trial and agricultural production in nearby areas. Furthermore, the project
will address the subsector's institutional development, system operations, and
management and staffing. The economic rate of return, based on the covenanted
tariff, is estimated at 14 percent.
16.       Risks.  No major risks are foreseen for the proposed project.  Con-
struction risks are within raasonable limits and should be manageable with the
continuous supervision arrangements, with assistance of foreign and Chinese
consultants, which are already involved in implementation of the project. The
economic risks, if any, would be minimal. No specific environmental problems
are expected under the project and the implementation of the proposed environ-
mental program should enhance the environmental quality in coastal regions and
the project area.
17.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
