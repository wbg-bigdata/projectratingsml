                  pressures. These risks will be mitigated by policy dialogue,
                  w h i c h will include the IFC. Macroeconomic risks due to the
                  results o f the global financial crisis could result in lower-than-
                  expected growth, resulting in poor macroeconomic performance
                  and affecting public sector pension reforms. Risk mitigation i s a

                  arrangement with the IMF, as i s monitoring budget execution

                  risk o f limited implementation capacity in the public sector
                  affecting the reform o f the c i v i l service payment system. This
                  risk will be mitigated by an ongoing Public Expenditure Review

                                                  COUNTRY

3.        Despite a recent p e r i o d o f r a p i d expansion m u c h o f Zambia's economic
history has been characterized by slow and uneven growth, leading t o declines in
b o t h p e r capita income and living standards during t h e f i r s t f o u r decades a f t e r
independence in 1964. Following moderate growth between 1964 and 1972, which was
largely fueled by rising copper prices, the economy stagnated in the 1980s and 1990s due
to a highly inefficient degree o f state control over the economy. After 1996 the economy
began to g r o w again, albeit slowly, as a result o f a relatively stable macroeconomic
environment supported by sound macroeconomic policies.2 However, real GDP per
capita in 1999 was equivalent to 50 percent o f G D P per capita in 1965, and by 2007 this
figure had increased to only 64 percent. Poor growth has translated into falling living
standards, and Zambia's rank in the UN Human Development Index for 2009 i s 164 out
o f 182

with large macroeconomic imbalances a n d l a c k o f consistency in t h e implementation
o f reforms. In the past the government typically dealt with fiscal imbalances by reducing
investment spending and increasing arrears, which generated large quasi-fiscal
obligations in the 1990s. Commitment t o structural reforms was also weak, resulting in
the government's failure to create an environment within which the private sector was
encouraged to diversify away f r o m copper by pursuing alternatives b o t h in the domestic

and export markets. The weak implementation o f reforms has also been reflected in
Zambia's slow improvement in the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA)
ratings, which assesses the extent to which a government's policies and institutions
promote economic growth and poverty reduction, especially when compared to the more
ambitious reform-minded governments in Africa.

5.      Higher recent GDP growth has not been sufficient either to substantially
alleviate poverty o r to improve income distribution. Poverty levels remain very high,
with 59 percent o f the population living below the poverty l i n e and 36 percent in extreme
poverty as at 2006, only slightly less than in 1998. Total income distribution, however,
has remained virtually constant over the same period: in 1996 the Gini coefficient was
0.61, and in 2006 i t was 0.60. At the same time, the income divide between urban and
rural areas remains large, and migration from rural areas to the cities i s increasing. While
poverty in urban areas has declined from 56 percent in 1998 t o 27 percent in 2006, it has
remained very high in rural areas (at 77 percent in 2006 compared to 83 percent in 1998).

6.     Zambia has benefited substantially from the Heavily Indebted Poor Country
(HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt R e l i e f Initiative (MDRI). External debt
sustainability has improved greatly thanks to debt relief, as debt ratios are expected to
remain well below the thresholds for both the baseline and alternative scenarios
(including large public investment projects in the energy sector involving external
financing on non-concessional terms). In addition, significant fiscal space was created by
lowering debt service payments.

7.       I n the wake o f H I P C and MDRI the role o f the donor community has
gradually been reduced and i s not as prominent as in many other countries in
Africa. In the latest three years budget support including project grants amounted to
about 18 percent o f total government spending, down from 22 percent in 2004 and from a
peak o f 27 percent in 2002. This compares favorably with Malawi (at about 35 percent),
Mozambique (34 percent), and Tanzania (24 percent). This means that the government's
ability to mobilize i t s own resources, and i t s capacity to improve the quality o f spending
in infrastructure, are both extremely important.

                            THE GLOBAL        CRISIS

8.       Zambia has enjoyed significant economic progress in recent years and the
economy has proven resilient to the recent global financial crisis. The global financial
crisis has impacted the country primarily through the copper mining sector, the mainstay
o f the economy, as the price o f copper and i t s global demand plummeted in mid-October
2008, which substantially reduced export proceeds, capital inflows, and government
revenue. Nevertheless, the large investment in the mining sector in the wake o f
privatization in the 1990s, supported by sound macroeconomic policies before the crisis
and significant debt r e l i e f coupled with advances in structural reform, have helped the
economy to absorb the shock quite well.

9.      Economic growth, as a result, has remained strong. Real GDP growth i s
estimated at 5.3 percent in 2009, which i s more or less in line with i t s average for 2007-
2008 (5.7 percent in 2008 and 6.3 percent in 2007). This growth has been led by a
significant increase in mining output, as copper prices quickly recovered early in the year
(figure 1). The agricultural sector has also contributed, with output increasing markedly
following a bumper harvest in 2008, as has the construction sector, where strong demand
for housing ensured that output continued to expand rapidly. The expansion in these
sectors has more than compensated for the deceleration o f manufacturing and the tertiary
sectors-with tourism declining especially sharply.

 10.    Fiscal performance has, however, weakened as substantial shortfalls in
revenues have arisen and tax collections are being eroded rapidly. Tax revenues
declined sharply in 2009 and pushed the fiscal deficit, including grants, to 2.6 percent o f
GDP, up from 2.2 percent in 2008 and 0.2percent in 2007. Collections for all tax
categories fell, with the exception o f personal income tax, marking three consecutive
years o f decline. A drop-off in the collection o f import-related taxes (1.3 percent o f GDP)
and mining taxes has been the main contributor to the overall decline, the latter owing to
the precipitous decline in copper prices in 2008 and to the difficulties encountered in
implementing the new fiscal regime for mining in 2009, and the former explained as a
result o f the large depreciation o f the kwacha in the first half o f 2009 and i t s effect
dampening imports o f consumer goods, including vehicles.

11.     A drop in donor funds also added to the growth o f the fiscal deficit. The
shortfall in donor funding was caused primarily by concerns about governance issues, as
corruption and embezzlement were discovered in the Ministry o f Health, which
considerably delayed funding disbursement. The global economic downturn has also
played a role by shrinking revenues o f the donor countries and reducing available foreign
aid funds. Disbursed donor funds in 2009 declined by US$60 million, or 0.5 percent o f
Zambian GDP, thereby reducing overall grants received to 2.7 percent, o f GDP compared
to 3.8 percent in 2008 and 4.6 percent in 2007.

12.   The Zambian authorities, with support from the IMF, have responded
appropriately to the shortfalls in both tax revenues and donor disbursements.

                                              3
Within the context o f the IMF's Article I V Consultations and the third review o f a Three-
Year Arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and G r o w t h Facility (PRGF), the
authorities have sought t o limit spending to domestically financed resources, and in some
instances curbed total expenditure t o lower-than-planned levels. They have, in addition,
committed t o undertake a thorough review o f the tax system, particularly regarding
exemptions, and to strengthen tax administration by determining what measures can be
taken t o raise tax collections and thereby increase the available fiscal space. Furthermore,
as a result o f a constitutional amendment in October 2009 the authorities have n o w
realigned the budget cycle with the full calendar year, as opposed to the previous nine
months or fewer, w h i c h should strengthen budget execution starting in 20 10.

13.     There are, nonetheless, constraints to the government's ability to offset the
revenue shortfalls and, more importantly, reversing the trend decline remains
challenging. The measures undertaken so far have been insufficient to effectively protect
social spending, especially in the health sector, as the major donors-The Netherlands
and Sweden, suspended disbursements in M a y 2009 and did not resume payments until
December 20093. Moreover, spending pressures have mounted, and are continuing to do
so, because o f c i v i l service wages increases, large fertilizer subsidies, subsidies for
expenses incurred in the presidential election, and a capital injection to ZESCO, the state-
owned electricity conglomerate.

14.     Inflation has fallen to single digits for the first time since the food and fuel
price-induced highs o f 2008, moderating steadily since the second half of 2009.
Consumer price inflation f e l l t o 9.9 percent in December 2009, after declining gradually
since August 2009, f r o m a high o f 16.6 percent at the end o f 2008. The f a l l in inflation
has been driven by lower food prices, thanks to a bumper harvest following good rains in
2008. This effect has been especially strong for the key foodstuff, corn (maize). Food-
price inflation fell to 8 percent in 2009 f r o m 20.5 percent in 2008. Prices for several non-
food products also fell, due in part to exchange rate strengthening, although the pace o f
the decline has remained modest.

15.        The maintenance of a flexible-float exchange rate regime has served Zambia
well in the context o f both the food and financial crises of 2008 and the global
financial crisis and recession. I t has enabled the economy to adjust to external shocks,
particularly movements in copper prices, while also providing the flexibility to intervene
in the domestic foreign-exchange market to address excess volatility. The foreign-
exchange value o f the Zambian kwacha (ZMK) has therefore moved in keeping with the
changes in i t s fundamental determinants. The surge in global food and fuels prices in
mid-2008, for example, l e d to a steep depreciation o f the kwacha, as copper prices were
in freefall. As copper prices rebounded in early 2009, the kwacha rose sharply in the first
half o f the year and has recently stabilized. The rise has also reflected an increase in
export proceeds alongside a large increase in the level o f international reserves following
the US$650 million-equivalent Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation to Zambia,
w h i c h has consolidated market sentiment in pricing the currency. Furthermore, the Bank

 Grant disbursements resumed after these donors received assurances from the government that it was
committed to fighting corruption in the public sector.

                                                   4
o f Zambia has periodically intervened to ensure orderly conditions in the foreign-
exchange market.

16.    The external balance-of-payments position i s relatively stable, after having
weathered the negative impact o f the global financial crisis from mid-2008 through
to early 2009. The current-account deficit (including grants) i s estimated to have
narrowed in 2009 to 4.7 percent o f GDP, compared to 7.8 percent in 2008, bolstered by
higher export proceeds as copper prices rebounded. Imports o n the other hand have
compressed owing, in part, to the sharp drop in the value o f the kwacha during 2008, but
have since stabilized following the recent recovery o f copper prices.

 17.   Some limited progress i s being made in reducing poverty, which raises the
possibility o f attaining some of the country's millennium development goals.
Recently revised data f r o m the 2006 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey (LCMS) have
pointed t o a slight reduction in the headcount o f Zambians living below the poverty line
to 59.3 percent, w h i c h i s d o w n f r o m 68 percent in 2004, 'and mainly concentrated in
urban areas. Poverty in the urban areas f e l l to 27 percent (from 53 percent in 2004) but
rural poverty, at 77percent in 2006 remains almost the same (78 percent in 2004).
Tackling rural poverty nonetheless remains a challenge, as the headcount-rate for this
category has risen. Health and education indicators have, however, been improving and
the country i s o n course towards meeting i t s goal o f universal primary education.

18.     Despite recent improvements, progress on social indicators in health and
education has remained slow. Zambia's l i f e expectancy i s one o f the lowest in the
world, at 41.7 years, compared to 50.5 years for all o f Sub-Saharan Africa and 57 years
as an average for L o w Income Countries (LICs). This i s explained in part by the high
prevalence o f HIV combined with poor overall health indicators. Infant mortality remains
extremely high at 182 deaths per 1,000 births, well above the rate for comparable
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and substantially higher that the average rate o f 135 per
1,000 for all LICs. In education, however, indicators present a slightly better picture
when compared to other countries. Primary net enrollment, at 92 percent, i s above the
average for Sub-Saharan Africa and the total L I C average, as i s the primary school
completion rate. N e t enrollment in secondary school, at 28 percent, i s slightly above the
average for Sub-Saharan Africa but lower than the L I C average.

                                          OUTLOOK
                              C. MACROECONOMIC

19.     The Zambian Government's Fifth FNDP, supported by the 2010-12 Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), identifies several key fiscal and
macroeconomic targets designed to: (i)         reduce the incidence o f absolute poverty
through providing poor households with adequate access t o basic services (social
infrastructure), and ensure food security by . raising productivity in smallholder
agriculture, (ii)rapidly improve the competiveness o f the economy by implementing
measures to reduce the cost o f doing business, (iii)     maintain overall macroeconomic
stability while addressing constraints to broad-based growth; (iv) keep government
borrowing at sustainable levels; (iv) scale-up economic diversification away f r o m mining
and toward agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing; (v) increase investment in human
capital; and (vi) enhance the competitiveness o f the Zambian economy. In order to
achieve these objectives the government has announced that it will continue t o implement
prudent fiscal, monetary, financial, and external policies.

20.     The IMF approved a three-year PRGF arrangement with Zambia in June
2008. The program with the IMF focuses o n (i)         maintaining macroeconomic and debt
sustainability while increasing the fiscal space for investment in infrastructure, energy,
and human resources, and (ii)      diversifying the economy to lessen dependence o n mining
by improving the conditions for private sector-led growth. The successful conclusion o f
the third review o f the program by the IMF on December 14,2009 has paved the way for
an immediate additional disbursement o f about US$81.2 m i l l i o n o n top o f
US$329.7 m i l l i o n disbursed in M a y 2009.

21.     Fiscal policy i s focused o n opening up fiscal space, o n both the revenue and
expenditure fronts, to sustain both the social and infrastructure spending plans
required to achieve its economic-diversification and poverty-reduction agenda; but
efforts aimed at reversing the decline in tax revenues are expected to be hampered
by revenue shortfalls due the ongoing difficulty in designing an effective tax regime
for the mining sector. Although copper prices rebounded o n the back o f the global
economic recovery and are expected to continue their surge beyond 2010, the
significantly lower tax rates resulting f r o m the revised fiscal regime for the mining sector
mean that the declining overall revenue trend i s unlikely to be reversed over the medium
term, as any future mining sector b o o m will contribute little to fiscal revenues. W h i l e the
realignment o f the budget cycle t o the calendar year has allowed more time for budget
execution, boosting tax revenues will require a substantial review o f tax policy and
administration in order t o improve efficiency in tax collection. Already, there are upward
pressures o n current spending for the salaries and benefits o f c i v i l servants that have
added substantial downside risks t o the realizations o f these commitments.

22.    Fiscal pressures resulting from the Fertilizer Support Program (FSP) and
food subsidies are likely to remain high. The 2010 projected budget allocation for both
programs i s more than double the 2009 budget figure. Political pressures in the run-up t o
the 201 1 general elections are l i k e l y to add pressure o n these programs and to the fiscal
accounts. The agricultural sector i s facing rising input costs and tighter lending


                                                7
conditions, which could require additional government subsidies for growing corn
(maize), the main food staple in Zambia.

                                 Box 1: Mining Sector Reform
Zambia's economy continues to depend on copper mining, and domestic reforms and fiscal
                                                     s
policies have stimulated growth of the sector, a have rising copper prices. The recent growth
o f the industrial sector's share o f GDP i s mostly due to the recovery o f the mining sector, which
had declined in importance during the 1990s as a result o f mismanagement under state ownership,
inadequate investment, and low world prices. In 2000, the government privatized Zambia
Consolidated Copper M i n e s (ZCCM), and a wave o f new private investment, together with
rapidly rising international prices for copper and cobalt, increased the prominence o f mining in
the industrial sector and in the Zambian economy generally. Following the recovery o f copper
prices the government projects an increase in copper output during 2010-20 12 as a result o f major
private investment efforts in the sector in recent years. However, a number o f problems including
flooding, electricity shortages, and poor labor relations still present important issues to be
addressed in the coming years. Moreover, private investment in mining slowed during 2009 due
to low copper prices and the difficulty o f accessing credit for copper-related activities.

Despite rapid growth in recent years, mining contributes relatively little to the
government's revenues. This i s in part because the sector has developed in an environment o f
preferential fiscal incentives, particularly in the form o f lower taxes. To attract foreign investment
and thereby stimulate the growth o f the mining sector, the government signed development
agreements with the mining companies that guaranteed stability in taxation for a period o f
between 15 to 20 years. As a result, high growth and even higher copper prices have not resulted
in higher revenues from mining.

The mining tax regime was changed in April 2008 in an effort to address this problem. The
revised tax regime included an increase in the royalty tax rate on copper and cobalt mining from
0.6 percent to 3 percent o f gross value, and an increase in the corporate income tax from
25 percent to 30 percent. In addition, mining companies were subjected to either a "variable"
profit tax on top o f the income tax equal to 15 percent o f profits that exceed 8 percent o f their
overall income, or an additional royalty tax (called a windfall tax in the new tax regime) to be
charged on the sales value o f copper at 25 percent above US$2.5/lb7 50 percent above US$3/lb,
                                                                      at
and up to 75 percent at prices above US$3.5/lb, whichever was highest. These measures were
expected to add more than $415 million to the government's revenue in 2008. However, their
implementation faced many difficulties as this required the government to break the
"development agreements" that it had signed with the mines, with the result that the majority o f
the mines refused to pay. Consequently, only a small portion o f the expected revenue was
collected.

As the global financial crisis produced a sharp contraction in copper prices, the government
again reversed its mining tax regime. In early 2009 the windfall tax was eliminated and the
capital allowance for tax pumoses was restored to 100 percent.

23.     A recently revised GDP growth projection o f 5.5 percent f o r 2010 has some
downside risk. While the global economic recovery i s already strengthening copper
prices and demand for Zambian mining exports i s rising, it may be some time before the
economic recovery i s firmly established, and before the positive effects o f rising mining
output spreads to other economic sectors (such as construction). The tourism sector, on


                                                  8
the other hand depends mostly o n external demand. Meanwhile, adverse changes in the
external scenario could easily constrain growth prospects, increase the current-account
deficit, and damage the country's fiscal outlook, though some o f these adverse effects
could be contained by additional financial support f r o m the I M F - P R G F program and
W o r l d Bank-DPL assistance.

24.     The government expects that prudent fiscal management during 2010-2011
will gradually allow f o r a reduction in the s u e o f current expenditure in terms o f
GDP t o 16.9 percent in 2010 and 15.6 percent in 2011 (from 18 percent in 2009) and
o f the overall deficit t o 1.6 percent in 2011. This improvement, however, i s highly
dependent o n the government broadening i t s revenue base, maintaining control over the
wage bill, and effectively targeting subsidies and social transfers.

25.      The government's planned increase in public expenditure on poverty-
reduction programs and commitment t o limiting the growth o f current spending
will require substantial political will t o be implemented effectively. The government's
agenda for limiting the growth o f agricultural subsidies, raising electricity tariffs to
strengthen ZESCO's financial position, and containing demands for higher public-sector
salaries in 2010 i s likely to be faced with increased political pressures t o allocate
resources towards coping with the deterioration o f living standards and rising
unemployment resulting f r o m lower growth in tourism and other labor-intensive service
sectors.

26.   The government deficit i s estimated t o remain above 2 percent o f GDP
during 2010 and then halved in 2011 and beyond, but reaching even those targets

                                                  9
will require a significant effort to reduce spending, as many recent policy decisions
were based on the expectation o f a strong link between higher copper prices and
higher fiscal revenues. Previous revenue projections will not be accurate given current
and expected prices over the next t w o years. The necessary budget restrictions will
correspond to the decline in fiscal revenues despite the current rise in copper prices.
Moreover, the deficit could actually increase if the government i s not able t o sustain the
fiscal discipline agreed to under the PRGF arrangement with the IMF, even if the
economy continues to grow at a healthy pace.

                                       SUSTAINABILITY

27.      External debt alleviation through the Enhanced Heavily-Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) initiative has reduced Zambia's debt burden significantly. Since
2003 a drastic reduction o f Zambia's external obligations has diminished i t s overall debt
burden: in 2003, the implementation o f the H I P C initiative (the Decision Point for which
Zambia had reached in 2000) reduced the present value o f i t s external debt, and in 2005
Zambia reached the Completion Point o f the H I P C program, w h i c h reduced i t s total debt
by about 55 percent. In December o f the same year under *the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative (MDRI) Zambia received 100 percent r e l i e f o f a l l debt incurred t o the IMF
before 2005. These debt-relief measures were accompanied by several countries
canceling Zambia's bilateral debts, resulting in a net external debt burden o f
approximately 22percent o f GDP in 2006. The reduction in debt service provides the
opportunity to increase Zambian foreign exchange reserves, strengthening the kwacha
and bolstering the financial system. Zambia's foreign exchange regime i s a flexible float,



                                                10
so there i s no question o f running out o f foreign exchange, but the current high level o f
reserves has helped the Bank o f Zambia's ability to manage external shocks.

28.     Zambia reached HIPC completion in April 2005 and became eligible for the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative as of July 1, 2006. This has greatly reduced
Zambia's external debt obligations, which currently stand at about 10 percent o f GDP.
Nevertheless, Zambia will need to remain prudent with regard to i t s external borrowing
strategy in order to prevent i t s debt from returning to unsustainable levels. The
government has prepared a debt management strategy that encompasses external as well
as domestic debt.

29.     A Low Income Countries Debt Sustainability Analysis (LIC-DSA) was
completed in 2009 as part of the IMF's Article I V consultations. The analysis
concluded that Zambia faces a low risk o f debt distress. Zambia's stock o f external debt
declined substantially with the advent of the HIPC Initiative and MDRI; external debt-to-
GDP declined from about 86 percent in 2005 to around 9 percent in 2006. The debt ratio
increased marginally to 11.5 percent of GDP in 2008, most of which i s public and
publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt. Zambia's external debt ratios are projected to remain
well below the risk threshold for the period covered by the LIC-DSA (Le., 2009-29). At
end-2005, public debt was about 105 percent o f GDP, 18 percent o f which was domestic
debt. After extensive debt r e l i e f from foreign creditors, Zambia's public debt decreased to
27 percent o f GDP in 2006 and further to 26 percent in 2009. The share of domestic debt
i s now just below 60 percent. Treasury bills and bonds comprise 95 percent o f domestic
debt. Around 15 percent o f the total i s held by foreigners.

30.     According to the 2009 LIC-DSA analysis, although external debt burden
indicators are expected to rise in the medium term, they are also expected to remain
well below the indicative policy thresholds over the projection period The stock o f
external debt i s expected to remain at around 12-17 percent of GDP through 2014 and to
decline thereafter. The present value (PV) o f public and PPG debt to GDP i s projected to
be in the 8-13 percent range through 2014, well below the 40 percent threshold, and to
decline thereafter. In the analysis the PV of debt to exports increases from 21 percent in
2008 to 44 percent by 2014, well below the 150 percent threshold, and declines
thereafter. The PV o f PPG debt to revenue increases from 41 percent in 2008 to around
80 in 2012-14 after which it declines. This compares favorably to the threshold o f 250
percent. Debt service as a percentage o f exports increases from 1.5 in 2008 to 5 by 2014,
well below the 20 percent threshold. PPG debt service as a percentage of revenue i s in the
2.5-9.0 range through 2014 and declines thereafter, again well below the threshold of 30
percent.


                1.
               1 1 THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

3 1.   The government's long-term development objectives are articulated in its
National Vision 2030. The National Vision 2030 stipulates that` Zambia intends to
become "a prosperous middle-income country by the year 2030." The vision will be
carried out through five-year medium-term planning instruments containing specific

                                              11
policies, programs and projects predominantly targeted towards wealth creation and
poverty reduction. The FNDP4 i s the first o f these medium-term plans, and i s being
implemented f r o m 2006 to 20 10.

32.   Zambia completed i t s first Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper in 2002 and
has initiated its Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP) for 2006-2010. The
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) focused o n promoting growth in key sectors
(particularly those associated with rural poverty), diversifying both output and exports,
improving economic and political governance, bolstering macroeconomic stability,
enhancing social services delivery, and strengthening private investment. The FNDP for
2006-20 10 i s intended to emphasize labor-intensive growth supported by macroeconomic
stability, infrastructure investment, and improved social services for the poor.5

33.   I n addition to the long-term program articulated in the FNDP, the
government also presented its medium-term programs. The specific strategies
designed to contribute to the achievement o f the long-term goals have been articulated in
the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and the Performance Assessment
Framework (PAF). These medium-term programs are further operationalized in the
annual budgets.

34.     The MTEF identifies the need for improved competitiveness and
diversificationto sustain economic growth and reduce poverty. In order to support the
diversification efforts o f the country as a whole, the MTEF states that the government
will focus o n improving competitiveness through structural reforms designed to
strengthen energy, transport and communications infrastructure. In the energy sector
these will include the adjustment o f electricity tariffs t o cost-recovery levels in order to
attract much-needed private investment in the sector and addressing the performance o f
ZESCO with the a i m o f improving i t s efficiency, governance, and quality o f service. In
transportation the m a i n goal will be improving existing railway infrastructure, and in
communications it will be the liberalization o f international gateways to allow greater
access t o the domestic market. In order t o augment these reform efforts the government
                                                                                                     .
also recognizes the need to continue reforms in public expenditure management and
budget execution. The MTEF also recognizes the need to create more fiscal space to
increase poverty-reduction spending in the medium term; in t h i s area the MTEF
highlights the need to clear domestic arrears t o suppliers and pensioners.

The Public Sector Reform Program

35.    The Government Strategy for the three priority areas of the Public Service
Reform Programme (PSRP), outlined the government's overall intentions and
commitment to enhancing institutional and human capacity in the public service.
The interventions proposed in the Strategy were intended to provide the impetus for the
government's political, economic and social reforms in general and to improve public-
expenditure management, the quality o f service delivery and democratic governance in

particular. In addition, the interventions were intended to address the specific challenges
identified under each o f the three priority areas o f reform. Among the major challenges
include weak public-expenditure management and financial control systems, a bloated
and unsustainably expensive public service, and an inefficiently high degree o f
centralizati,ono f government functions and processes. The three priority areas for reform
identified where: (i)    Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability
(PEMFA), (ii)   Public Service Management (PSM); and (iii)     Decentralization.

a) P E M F A

36.    The P E M F A reform program was viewed as central to meeting the country's
targets f o r economic growth and poverty reduction, and therefore crucial to the
realization o f Zambia's development aspirations. Over the last 10 years Zambia has
undertaken a number o f fiscal reforms aimed at improving public expenditure
management and financial accountability with the support o f its cooperating partners.
While substantial progress has been made, significant weaknesses still remained in the
areas o f budget planning, preparation and implementation, budget execution and
procurement, financial reporting, and auditing. In November 2003 the Government o f the
Republic o f Zambia, with the support o f a number o f cooperating partners led by the
World Bank, completed a comprehensive analysis o f its public expenditure management
and financial accountability status based upon the Public Expenditure Management and
Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) and Country Procurement Assessment Review diagnostic tools.

Six key priority actions were identified within the Zambia PEMFAR:

    1. Revise the public financial management legal framework;

   2. Strengthen Parliament's oversight o f the budget;

   3 . Improve the presentationo f the budget;

   4. Strictly limit the use o f supplemental appropriations;

    5. Establish quarterly expenditure ceilings for line ministries, back ceilings with
       actual cash releases, and sanction officers who exceed their allotted budgets; and

    6. Ensure the independence o f the Office o f the Auditor General by creating an
       oversight body that reports to Parliament.

37.     The P E M F A R was adopted by the GRZ to serve as the basis for the
implementation o f a comprehensive and integrated public service reform program.
The comprehensiveness o f PEMFAR distinguished i t from previous, less inclusive
efforts. While this comprehensive approach was risky (as the capacity o f government to
address many reform areas at the same time was limited) its integrated approach provided
an opportunity for achieving the significant improvements in the quality o f public
expenditure management that have eluded many o f the previous reform efforts.

of the new accounting system, Integrated Financial Management Information System
(IFMIS), a substantial r e f o r m o f the public procurement system, and several reforms to
the overall budgeting and oversight processes in Zambia.

overarching p o l i c y goal o f the P S M component i s to enhance the delivery o f services for
Zambian citizens and t o create an appropriate institutional environment for reducing
poverty. The component has four sub-components: (i)                                Rightsizing; (ii) Reform; (iii)
                                                                                                              Pay
Performance Management; and (iv) Payroll Management and Establishment Control,
whose goals have been identified as follows:

   1.       Rightsizing. All government ministries and institutions have staff complements
            which are appropriate t o their agreed mandates and are affordable in relation to
            their respective budget ceilings.
  ..
  1.
   1        Pay reform. Employee remuneration i s related t o j o b type and performance; the
            public service i s able to attract and retain essential technical, professional and
            managerial staff; pay arrangements support and reinforce improved service
            delivery; and increases in pay levels are consistent with the resource envelope.
  ...

  1.        Performance Management. All government ministries and institutions are
            managing performance effectively within an agreed framework o f planned
            objectives and standards, and are taking action to improve their capacity to deliver
            better services.

  iv.       Payroll management and Establishment Control. Personnel emoluments and
            establishment8 for the public service are effectively managed and maintained at
            agreed-upon levels.

local government system. The measures taken included an elaboration o f the country's
governance regime, the inclusion o f decentralization in the PSRP as well as the passing
o f various amendments to the Local Government Act and related legislation to strengthen
the capacities and standing o f Councils. Towards the end o f the 1990s however, the
government recognized that in spite o f these measures little positive change was being
registered, particularly with respect to improvements in service provision, while the
PDCCs and DDCCs had generally remained ineffective. It i s in this context that the
government adopted i t s Decentralization Policy on November 18, 2002. The Policy was
subsequently launched by the President o n the August 20,2004. While this policy action
i s important o n i t s own, i t also represented the culmination o f a series o f other initiatives
that preceded it and which were also aimed at addressing the shortcomings o f the public
service, particularly at the local level.

The Private Sector Development Reform Program

41.    Zambia needs to implement pending structural reforms to maintain its
growth momentum. Enacting a number o f pending structural reforms will be crucial in
order for Zambia to face the current global crisis and improve the long-run
competitiveness o f i t s economy. These reforms include expanding electric generating
capacity and improving the operational efficiency o f ZESCO, enhancing the business
climate and ensuring greater institutional transparency to promote private investment
growth, all o f which are stated goals o f the FNDP.

42.     Limited transportation and energy infrastructure remain significant
obstacles to growth and the development o f a more dynamic and diversified export
sector. Despite some recent improvements, the inadequate road system continues to pose
a serious constraint to growth, while railroads are by far the weakest area in the
transportation sector. The communications sector has grown in recent years, but
continues to be hampered by poor government policies. The energy sector, especially the
electric power supply, presents a major challenge to Zambian development. The rapid
expansion o f mining and other energy-intensive activities in recent years, as well as the
need to run generators below capacity to allow for long-overdue maintenance, have
virtually exhausted the surplus o f electric power that characterized Zambia's energy
sector in the 1960s and `70s. Load-shedding (periodically shutting down electric
distribution to different sectors in the country) affects mining and non-mining business in
addition to residential electricity users during peak periods. Over the medium-term, a
potential power shortage threatens to become a major obstacle to the continued growth o f
the Zambian economy. The further expansion o f mining, agriculture, and manufacturing
will require increased access to electricity. With the whole o f southern Africa
experiencing a power deficit, any additional power would need to come largely from new
power generation within the country. While there i s an abundance o f hydroelectric
potential to be harnessed in Zambia, bringing new capacity o n l i n e will require
considerable investment and in many instances long lead times. The poor financial
condition and weak operational performance o f ZESCO, the state-owned power
company, render it ill-equipped to undertake the new investment needed to build power-
generating capacity. Furthermore, electricity prices are currently very low, and far from
sufficient to cover i t s operating costs (according to ZESCO, a 60 percent increase in the

                                                15
electricity t a r i f f would be necessary to meet the cost o f p r o d ~ c t i o n ) During 2007-2008,
                                                                                      .~
the rehabilitation o f power stations marginally increased electricity output.

43.      The government has designed a Private Sector Development Reform
Program (PSDRP) to promote private sector growth. The PSDRP i s a program
designed t o focus o n the business environment by improving access to financial services,
building and rehabilitating infrastructure, opening up both regional and international
markets, establishing transparent regulatory frameworks, bolstering the growth o f micro,
small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and expanding the availability o f skills training
and business development services. The overall objective o f the PSDRP i s to facilitate the
development o f a competitive business environment in Zambia in order t o foster more
rapid j o b and wealth creation.

44.    The key areas of the government's PSDRP have been determined
collaboratively with key stakeholders in the private and public sectors, and include:

  i. Business licensing and regulatory reforms. The costly and cumbersome
        business licensing regime in Zambia has been identified as a critical constraint to
        private sector development. M o s t business licensing processes and procedures
        lack transparency, are needlessly time-consuming, and in many cases are flatly
        unnecessary. V e r y f e w M S M E s are formally registered due to the cost o f
        registration in terms o f both time and money. M a n y laws and regulations are
        obsolete, and licensing practices have, in the main, failed to keep pace with
        modern technologies. The government has successhlly identified the bulk o f the
        licenses to be reduced and/or changed as part o f the PSDRP. The government's
        program includes a reduction in the number o f unnecessary licenses and in the
        costs o f compliance, as w e l l as a reduction and streamlining o f licensing
        requirements, and the establishment o f a Business Regulatory Unit and an online
        business registry.

   i
  i . MSME Development. The growth o f the M S M E s sector i s expected t o have a
      significant impact o n poverty reduction and the quality o f l i f e for Zambian
      households. MSMEs face numerous constraints that adversely affect their
      development, including lack o f access to finance and markets, high costs o f
      borrowing, shortages and high costs o f inputs (working capital traps), poor
      infrastructure, a lack o f skilled labor, limited utility services, and a harsh overall
      business environment. T o deal with these problems the government i s working o n
        the design o f an official M S M E policy, along with a credit guarantee scheme for
        MSMEs, an M S M E incubator program, and a training program for achieving
        access to finance and markets designed specifically for MSMEs.

  i.
 i i Labor Law Reform and Labor Productivity Development. Labor legislation
     has been identified as posing a significant impediment to the growth o f the private
     sector. The high cost o f severance packages as w e l l as the overall rigidities in the

 The electricity tariffs are set by the energy regulator, the Energy Regulatory Board (ERB). The ERB has
agreed with ZESCO that an increase in tariffs will occur as ZESCO improves i t s financial and business
performance, but ZESCO i s thus far lagging in this regard.

                                                  16
       labor market introduced by labor regulations act as deterrents to private sector
       growth. In addition there i s a significant gap between the practical vocational
       skills demanded by the private sector and those produced by the educational
       system. The government plans to reform business related labor laws, including
       issues o f retirement and severance packages, and to develop a system for
       measuring and improving labor productivity.

 iv.   Public Private Partnership (PPP) Development. The government has identified
       PPPs as a viable means o f infrastructure development that can address the
       constraints o n finance and management capacity that the government faces
       regarding public infrastructure and service projects. To develop PPPs the
       government has been working to legislate and put into action a dedicated PPP unit
       and to train private f i r m s and public sector agencies to undertake PPP
       arrangements.

 v.    Trade Expansion. Through cheaper, easier and faster transportation o f goods
       across regional and international borders businesses can develop a higher volume
       and wider variety o f trade in regional and international markets. The government
       i s working to develop more coherence in the policy, regulatory and legal
       framework for trade, while improving trade facilitation and border infrastructure
       and procedures and assuring the legitimacy o f the professional accreditation
       standards, product quality controls, and metrology national system, among other
       related initiatives.

45.     The government has also developed an electricity strategy designed to shore-
up supply, increase investment, and improve the operational and financial
performance o f ZESCO. The electricity strategy specifies the medium- and long-term
investment programs required to build new power stations and enhance the operational
and financial performance o f ZESCO. T o improve the efficiency o f ZESCO, a set o f Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) were agreed upon between the Energy Regulation Board
( E M ) and ZESCO. The KPIs fall under five main categories: (i) customer metering, (ii)
cash management, (iii) productivity, (iv) quality o f service, and (v) system losses.
                       staff

46.      These programs and priorities are reflected in the government's PAF. In
addition to the FNDP and MTEF, the government, in collaboration with national
stakeholders and international donors, has drawn up a PAF which further articulates
policy actions that the government intends to undertake on a subset o f core FNDP areas
o n a three-year rolling basis. The P A F provides a framework for more regular monitoring
o f progress made in undertaking a subset o f reforms that are considered key to the
achievement o f the FNDP goals. The current PAF 2009-201 1 articulates policy actions
that the government will undertake in three main clusters, namely Reform Process and
Financial Management (covering Decentralization, Public Sector Reform, Public Finance
Management and Macroeconomic Management), Wealth Creation (covering
Infrastructure-Roads, Energy, Water, Agriculture and Private Sector Development), and
Social Equity (focusing on Health and Education), as well as cross-cutting areas such as
HIV/AIDS and Environmental Policy. The implementation o f reforms in these areas will
lead to enhanced macroeconomic stability, a more efficient public sector, improved

                                           17
public finance management, improved rural economic connectivity, greater efficiency o f
the energy sector, enhanced agricultural productivity, improved access to and quality o f
social services, and a reduction in the cost o f doing business. Positive outcomes in these
crucial areas will substantially contribute towards the attainment o f the FNDP goals.


       IV. BANK SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT'S
                     PROGRAM

                    A. LINKS TO THE COUNTRY ASSISTANCESTRATEGY

47.     T h e P R S C series i s a k e y component o f the C o u n t r y Assistance Strategy,
approved by the B o a r d in M a y 2008. The CAS FY08-11, which aligns itself with the
government's objectives, supports two key areas o f emphasis: improved public
expenditure management, and investment in infrastructure to increase economic
opportunities and competitiveness. The CAS proposes selective interactions in four
priority areas identified in the FNDP. These four areas are: (i)macroeconomic
management; (ii)     infrastructure development; (iii) institutional capacity enhancement;
and (iv) social sector development.

48.    T h e C A S identifies the r e f o r m areas that t h e annual p r o g r a m o f P R S C s will
support. The PRSCs will support the core objective o f the Bank's macroeconomic
program to help Zambia better manage i t s financial resources so that fiscal policy can be
used to foster more inclusive growth. The main reform areas that the PRSCs will support
are the reform o f the energy sector, the improvement o f the business climate, and
capacity enhancement in public service.

                              B.   COORDINATION WITH THE IMF

49.     T h e IMF leads the dialogue on, and review of, the country's macroeconomic
performance. This assessment i s an underlying principle in the provision o f budget
support to the government, as outlined in the Memorandum o f Understanding (MoU) for
PRBS. The IMF agreed to a new three-year PRGF program in June 2008, in which
structural policy benchmarks in a number o f areas were developed in close consultation
with IDA. Other areas o f close collaboration include financial sector reform, debt-
sustainability analyses, trade policy formulation, and FNDP progress monitoring.

                         c.   COLLABORATION WITH OTHER DONORS

50.     T h e M o U that guides the process f o r p r o v i d i n g P R B S to GRZ was first
signed in mid-2005 by GRZ and i t s cooperating partners (CPs). This M o U was
further revised in June 2008, mainly to include new CPs. In addition to IDA, the
following CPs are part o f the PRES and are providing budget support: The European
Commission, The United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Finland,
Germany and the African Development Bank (AfDB). As part o f the ongoing changes in
the PAF, the M o U i s also likely to be updated, as mentioned by the CPs in the November
25, 2009 Meeting on PRBS. The proposed PRSC i s part o f this joint effort and all

                                                 18
proposed release milestones are part o f the PAF (2009-201 l),  which has been prepared
jointly with GRZ and i t s cooperating partners (cf. B o x 2: Good Practice Principles on
Conditionality).

                   Box 2: Good Practice Principles o n Conditionality
Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership
   The proposed operation draws directly from the Performance Assessment Framework
   (PAF) 2009-201 1, which was jointly prepared by representatives o f the Ministry o f
   Finance and National Planning (MoFNP) and Poverty Reduction Budget Support
   (PRBS) donors. The PAF i t s e l f i s linked to priorities and actions spelled out in
   Zambia's new PRSP/FNDP, which covers 2006-10. As with the PRSP/FNDP all
   indicators selected for the PAF were discussed in the relevant Sectoral Advisory
   Groups (SAGs), which consist o f government 'officials, representatives o f Non-
   Governmental Organizations (NGOs), civil society groups, business organizations,
   and donors. The SAGs are also the main forum used by GRZ to discuss the
   PRSP/FNDP and review progress in i t s implementation.

    The current PAF builds on the PAF for 2008-2010 which was originally developed in
    2007 and on the PAF for 2006-2008 which was developed in 2005 and included
    several actions from the previous Development Policy Operations (DPOs), the
                                                                1
    Economic Management and Growth Credits (EMGCs) Iand 1 . The implementation
    o f EMGC I was deemed moderately satisfactory, while a completion review o f
    EMGC I1 was prepared in the second quarter o f 2009. The implementation o f the
    PAFs and the previous DPOs together with a broadly satisfactory implementation o f
    the PRGF o f the IMF provide an adequate track record.

    The PRSP/FNDP, the PAF, and other ongoing reform efforts-particularly in the area
    o f public sector management-have benefited extensively from IDA and other joint
    analytical work. For example, the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), Poverty
    and Vulnerability Analysis (PVA), and the PEMFAR have all influenced the
    supported reforms, including the P A F and ongoing Technical Assistance (TA)
    Droiects.

Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and otherfinancialpartners on a
coordinated accountability framework
   IDA'Ssupport i s summarized in a brief and focused policy matrix and draws all i t s
   proposed measures from the P A F used by all PRBS donors providing budget support.
   Note that the P A F i s for three years and as such provides an accountability framework
   for the years 2009-11 and will be o f a rolling nature. In addition, the cooperating
   partners that are part o f the Wider Harmonization in Practice (WHIP) group, which
   includes IDA, prepared a Joint Assistance Strategy for Zambia in April 2007 as a
   response to the new PRSP/FNDP in order to further increase aid coordination and
   reduce transaction costs to GRZ.

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities o Bank support
                                                                          f
to country circumstances
    Building o n what has been articulated under principles one and two IDA'S budget
    support operation i s part o f the total support provided by all PRBS donors. As such,
    the biannual reviews agreed upon by GRZ and the PRBS donors are used to set the
    content o f the fonvard-looking PAF, the performance standards under the PAF, and
    the aid modalities that GRZ can expect for i t s upcoming fiscal year. The first two
    issues mentioned are part o f the discussions that take place in June o f each year, while
    the announcement o f the expected aid modalities in the form o f budget support are
    communicated during the October review.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditionsfor
disbursement
    All proposed IDA release milestones are chosen from the PAF. There are 38 total
    indicators monitored through the PAF, o f which eight are proposed to guide IDA'S
    disbursement under this operation. The milestones chosen are those that overlap with
    the objectives o f the CAS and the PRSP/FNDP and are thus critical to support the
    results agenda under the CAS.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and
performance-based financial support
0   Building o n what i s stated under Principle 3, IDA announces in conjunction with all
    other PRBS donors i t s expected amount o f budget support for GRZ's next fiscal year
    at the October PRBS review meeting. These dates are chosen to allow GRZ to
    prepare i t s budget knowing the amount it can expect in budget support.

0   The P A F i s a mix o f process and outcome indicators (see Annex 2) with process
    indicators mostly identified for the first year, i.e. 2008, so as to pave the way to
    achieving the results, which are identified in accompanying outcome indicators for
    later years.

51.     The MoU identifies t w o categories o f performance that are important for
disbursement. First, performance i s measured against underlying principles. These
comprise: (i)  GRZ's commitment to fight poverty, which includes maintaining a pattern
o f public expenditure consistent with poverty reduction priorities as identified in
Zambia's National Development Plan; (ii)         GRZ's commitment to peace, democratic
principles, the r u l e o f law, good governance, and integrity in public life, including the
fight against corruption; (iii)   GRZ' s commitment to public financial management reforms
as demonstrated by satisfactory progress with the PEMFA program; and (iv) GRZ's
commitment to pursuing sound macroeconomic policies, as i s shown by a positive IMF
assessment o f i t s overall macroeconomic performance. Second, performance i s measured
against specific process and outcome indicators specified in the PAF. The PAF i t s e l f does
not include indicators related to the underlying principles.8

52.      The MoU allows each donor to decide how much it will disburse against the
underlying principles and/or against all o r a subset o f indicators spelled out in the
PAF. At present there are 38 indicators and milestones included in the PAF, compared to
34 indicators in the 2008-2010 PAF on which this operation was initially based. For each
o f the indicators and milestones a baseline figure for the year 2007 has been included, as
well as target outcomes for the years 2008, 2009, and 2010. The targets for the two later
years may be revised based upon performance for the year 2008.

53.      The PAF for 2008-10 and the PAF for 2009-11 were jointly prepared with
GRZ, in particular with the staff o f the MoFNP, and the PRBS donors, including
I D A . Extensive consultations took place with the l i n e Ministries and the Sectoral
Advisory Groups (SAGs), which consist o f government officials, representatives o f Non-
Governmental Organizations (NGOs), civil society groups, business organizations, and
donors. The SAGs are also the main forum used by GRZ to discuss the PRSP/FNDP and
review rogress in their implementation. All PRBS donors at the January 2009 review
        !
meeting endorsed the final version o f the PAF 2008-2010, as did the donors present at
the December 2009 review meeting for the P A F 2009-201 1.

54.     The government and the PRBS donors meet twice a year to review
performance in relation to the agreed PAF for the previous year, and to agree on the
contents o f the P A F for the following year. The joint review meetings take place each
year in June and October:

        a. The June review meeting focuses on the PRBS donors and government
           arriving at a joint view on performance, which serves as the basis for
           commitments for the next budget year. The review i s based on the National
           Development Plan's Annual Review, the annual PEMFA progress reports,
           Quarterly Budget Execution Reports and related information, plus the national
           audits.

* The PAF does include indicators that measure macroeconomic performance and public expenditure
management, but the underlying principles include a wider set o f indicators and actions on which the
donors evaluate the performance o f the government.
  The January 2009 review replaced the October review, which was postponed due to presidential elections
after the death o f President Mwanawasa.

                                                  21
        b. The October review meeting focuses o n forward planning and budgeting and
           reaching an agreement o n the PAF for the next budget year. This dialogue i s
            based o n the annual Financial Reports o f the previous budget year, the Annual
            PEMFA Evaluation, and the ceilings in the annual budget for the next budget
            year as specified in Zambia's MTEF Green Paper. During this review meeting
            each member o f the PRBS Group confirms the volume o f i t s commitment, the
            government and PRBS donors agree o n the P A F for the next budget year, and
            any PRBS donor (Le., IDA) intending to provide a floating element confirms
            against the n e w PAF the specific milestones, indicators and/or targets that will
            trigger an immediate disbursement at the relevant review meeting in the
            following year.

                       D. RELATIONSHIP OTHER IDA OPERATIONS
                                     TO

55.     The P R S C program will complement several operations and ongoing
knowledge-based activities identified in the C A S FY 2008-11. In the area o f Public
Sector Reform IDA has in place a TA operation, the Public Service Management
Program", assisting GFU in the area o f c i v i l service and pay reform as w e l l as with
reforms in public expenditure management and financial accountability, including the
installation o f an Integrated Financial Management Information System. IDA i s also
beginning preparation o f a Public Expenditure Review with the government and the
support o f other cooperating partners, w h i c h will focus o n the efficiency and equity o f
public resource allocation across sectors. The reforms in the areas o f wealth creation, Le.,
those related t o the reform in the electricity sector and improvements in doing business,
will support the Bank's a i m to assist the government in improving ZESCO's efficiency
and quality o f services through Investment Lending and TA. In support o f the
government's private sector reform agenda, the Bank i s also working o n a Jobs and
Competitiveness Economic and Social W o r k (ESW) focusing o n the areas o f private
sector development in tourism, beef and dairy production, and value addition in the
copper sector, In the area o f social equity IDA has prepared Public Expenditure Reviews
for the education and health sectors.

                                   LEARNED FROM PAST DPOS

56.     The P R S C program will draw on the lessons learnt from the past DPOs,
             1
EMGC I& 1 . E M G C I I1were t w o DPOs identified in the previous C A S FY2004-07
                        &
to assist GRZ in policy and institutional reforms. EMGC Iwas approved in December
2004 and closed in December 2005, while EMGC I1 was approved in M a y 2008 and
closed in December 2008.

57.    The major lessons to be drawn from EMGC I and I1 for the P R S C program
are based on IEG's evaluation o f the operation.it's The Implementation Completion

lo The PSM project in the amount o f US$30 million was approved by the board on January 5,2006 and was
declared effective on May 10, 2006. The operation contributes to a pooled-funding arrangement and i s in
  art a follow-up on the Public Sector Capacity Building project, which closed in 2005.
   See ICR o f the EMGC operation, report No. 36495 ZA and IEG's evaluation dated March 26, 2007 and
report No. ICROOOOllO7 for the EMGC I1 dated June 25,2009.

and Results Report (ICR) for E M G C I  was finalized in March 2007 and for E M G C 1 was
                                                                                     1
finalized in June 2009. One o f the key lessons from IEG's evaluation o f E M G C II C R i s
the need to recognize that institutional reforms require a longer time horizon than can be
achieved through a one-year disbursing credit. A second (and related) lesson i s that the
conditions o f the credit were not adequate to meet the objectives o f the program. Taking
these lessons into account, the CAS identified a series o f three annual credits, PRSCs, as
the method by which policy reform will be supported. This provides a longer time
horizon in which to undertake the reforms described in the program. Finally, recognizing
the importance o f the reform areas to which the previous credits were directed, the
program will continue to support most o f these reforms.

                              F. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

58.    The proposed program draws from a variety o f economic and sector work.
This includes the P E M F A R 2004, CEM, Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), Foreign
Investment Advisory Services (FIAS) Administrative Barriers to Investment Report,
PVA, as well as the diagnostic work on " constraints to inclusive growth"12 undertakenas
an input into the current CAS (2008-201 1). In addition the credit draws from reports and
evaluations carried out by GRZ, such as "Zambia: Public Financial Management
Performance Report and Performance Indicators", a Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Assessment (PEFA) 2005 and 2008. In the energy sector, the ongoing
work related to the TA o n the "Electricity Sector Performance Review". In the social
sectors the operation draws o n the recently-completed PER for the education sector and
on the preliminary findings o f the health sector PER.

59.     The CEM and I C A reviewed the conditions f o r private investment and
enterprise growth and examined the reasons behind the country's unimpressive
economic performance, worsening poverty, and deteriorating social conditions, in
spite o f its having undertaken major policy and structural reforms for most o f the
1990s. Several key problems were identified: (i)              macroeconomic mismanagement
resulting from poor fiscal discipline and inefficient budget administration; (ii)        lack o f
ownership o f the reform process and poor policy implementation that led to the partial
(and in some cases late) implementation o f several reforms; (iii) weak investment
                                                                            a
climate, i t s e l f largely caused by policy uncertainty; (iv) a poor overall business climate;
(v) inadequate infrastructure; (vi) the lack o f a regulatory framework for key economic
services such as energy and telecommunications; (vii) the lack o f good governance in
general and adherence to r u l e o f law in particular; and (viii) a looming H I V / A I D S
pandemic. The studies recommended an improvement in policy implementation and
ownership in areas where strategies and policies were already in place, maintenance o f
policy stability, implementation o f sound fiscal policy and management, reform o f the
financial and telecommunications sectors to support private investment, the removal o f
other barriers to investment and measures to increase access to markets through improved
service provision key areas such as energy, communications and transportation, and an
improvement in the overall relations between the public and private sectors. Significant

improvements have occurred since the 199Os, especially in the area o f macroeconomic
policy and overall growth, but the structural reform agenda s t i l l needs to be implemented.

60.     The FIAS Administrative Barriers Study described Zambia's licensing as
"cumbersome, time consuming and all too frequently redundant", and recommended
that the government should review all registration and licensing inspection procedures
with a v i e w t o simplifying requirements, reducing discretionary powers, eliminating
redundancy o f procedures and information, promoting information sharing, and reducing
procedural time and cost.

61.       The PEMFAR reviewed the country's public finance management systems.
The report (2004) identifies several shortcomings in the legislative framework and in
public finance information management, w h i c h hindered enforcement and accountability,
as w e l l as in the budget process in terms o f the comprehensiveness, classification and
presentation o f the budget, in the budget execution and procurement processes, and in
expenditure tracking. These were further compounded by a poorly-motivated and largely
unskilled public service. The PEMFAR recommended a revision o f the legal framework
for financial management, stronger parliamentary oversight over the budget,
improvements in the budget processes with regard to preparation and execution,
improvements in the institutional mechanisms for accountability, and public service
reform. The outcomes o f PEFA 2005 benchmarking on the PFM systems were
similar to those o f PEMFAR. PEFA recommended that the government: (i)            focus o n
strengthening expenditure controls before further development o f strategic budgeting; (ii)
ensure better information f l o w throughout the system; and (iii) build better analytical
capacities at a l l levels, particularly in accounting and budget analysis. Some o f the
recommendations in P E M F A R and P E F A were incorporated in the PEMFA project,
w h i c h was part o f the Public Sector Reform program introduced in 2005. The other
recommendations are incorporated as required policy changes in P A F 2008-2010.

62.     The PVA found that despite economic gains poverty levels were unacceptably
high in Zambia, especially among the rural poor. The assessment identifies four
fundamental challenges faced by the country in i t s efforts t o reduce poverty and increase
equity: (i) need for policies designed to expand economic opportunities for the poor;
          the
(ii) recognition that the poverty-reduction impacts o f reforms are contingent o n the
    the
poor having the necessary tools to participate in growth; (iii) need to recognize and
                                                                   the
account for the risk-averse nature o f the poor; and finally (iv) the need to develop a well-
functioning and responsive public administration to improve governance.

63.     The government has made some strides in addressing the problems identified
above, but significant challenges remain. With regard to macroeconomic
management, the government has instilled fiscal discipline in expenditure management,
initiated an MTEF that enables forward-looking and policy-based planning o f the budget,
improved parliamentary oversight through the establishment o f the Public Accounts
Committee (PAC), and effected improvements in the macroeconomic environment. The
government has also been tackling issues in the jinancial sector and the private sector
through the Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP) and the Private Sector
Development Program (PSDP), w h i c h a i m to improve access to finance, financial

                                              24
information, and business licensing in the context o f a more hospitable investment
climate bolstered by a sound trade policy and a commitment to institutional development.
The reforms in public finance and public service management are supported under the
PEMFA project, which receives funding from a large group o f CPs including IDA. TA
operations are included, as noted in paragraph 49 above. The PEMFA includes some o f
the main areas o f public sector management in which Zambia should make
improvements. The others PFM reforms are being addressed under the PAF 2008                -
2010, in areas in which donors, including IDA under PRSC, are offering budget support
to GRZ. There i s no duplication o f policy reforms under PEMFA and PAF. These
improvements are crucial to ensure the sustainability o f the macroeconomic framework
as well as to strengthen the government's ability to direct resources to expenditure
programs that are high priorities in Zambia's PRSP, and to improve the credibility and
accountability o f the government with the business sector and with civil society. One o f
the main conclusions o f the P V A was that the impact o f growth on the poor can be
enhanced by ensuring that rural citizens are able to more fully participate in the economic
process. This finding i s reflected in the FNDP in i t s focus on agriculture and physical
infrastructure, especially rural roads.

64.     Government efforts at tackling some of the problems identified, mainly via
PEMFA and PAF projects, have begun to show modest positive results. The recent
PEFA evaluation (2008) shows improvements in several P F M indicators, notably the
credibility o f the budget, as well as i t s comprehensiveness and transparency (in terms o f
the information provided in budgetary and fiscal reports), and with regard to internal
auditing and accounting and legislative scrutiny o f the annual budget. The Doing
Business report (2009) shows significant improvement in several business-climate
indicators. However, weaknesses s t i l l exist in budget execution: variances across
individual budget heads continue to be significant (averaging 15 percent); the
accessibility o f budget information to the wider public remains limited; internal payroll
controls need to be strengthened; and delays in updating personnel records and in
implementing recommendations by the Auditor-General and P A C persist. Full
implementation . o f IFMIS remains critical in order to process and produce timely
financial information. PEMFA and PAF both include policies that would address these
weaknesses.

65.     However, a number of binding constraints s t i l l exist with respect to economic
growth and poverty reduction, as other recent analytical work has shown. The
constraints analysis to growth in Zambia published by the Bank in 2008 analyzes the
potential for enhancing pro-poor growth in Zambia.I3 A main challenge identified i s to
improve the functioning o f the agricultural sector while enhancing access to markets
through a better road network and broadening the availability o f (micro) finance in rural
areas. The analysis finds that market coordination failures such as poor access to markets,
inputs and information, as well as high indirect costs related to services (Le. energy,
transport and telecommunications), undermine the country's competitiveness, limit j o b
creation, and hinder inclusive growth. The study points to ineffective governance and
regulatory mismanagement (which i s also reflected in a number o f distortionary policies,
especially in agriculture) as a primary factor behind the market coordination failures.

66.     The government program articulated in the FNDP, MTEF, PAF and annual
budget outline substantial and important reform efforts that are being undertaken
to move the country onto a higher and more solid growth path, one that will enable
it to meet the challenge posed by rising poverty and inequality. However achieving
these objectives will require an enhanced and sustained effort by the government to fully
implement the necessary reforms. The PRSC program, described in detail in the next
section, i s designed to support the government's continuing efforts to complete the
ongoing reform process, to confront many o f the challenges already identified, and to
begin to undertake policy actions in areas not previously addressed, such as energy
policy.

                                       (COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM)

70.     A n a l y t i c a l w o r k u n d e r t a k e n o n Zambia indicates that t h e c o u n t r y continues
t o faces several challenges. These range from consolidating macroeconomic growth to
tackling the growing ruralhrban divide, and will require improving government
effectiveness, public finance management, and the quality o f productive services such as
energy, transportation, and telecommunications, as well as creating a non-discretionary
policy environment and improving the overall business climate. The government i s
committed to undertakingthe appropriate policy actions to address these challenges.

71.         In light o f t h e challenges involved, and t o s u p p o r t t h e government's r e f o r m
p r o g r a m , t h e P R S C w i l l focus o n b o l s t e r i n g r e f o r m efforts in the areas o f
macroeconomic management, public service administration, and public finance
management, as well as reforms in private sector development, the management o f the
energy system, and in reducing the cost o f doing business. The areas are as set out in the
PAF and hence the Bank will apply the prior actions and triggers described therein
(previously agreed upon by the GRZ and PRBS donors).

financial crisis in 2008-09 the government has continued to make progress in
attaining macroeconomic stability; however, challenges still remain. The government
experienced many lapses in fiscal discipline in the 1990s, resulting in poor commitment
control and the accumulation o f arrears t o domestic suppliers and the pension fund. The
FNDP recognizes that reforms and advances in these areas over the last five years must
be maintained in order to preserve the gains f r o m macroeconomic stability. In this regard,
critical areas o f concern remain, particularly with respect to the high domestic debt and
an insolvent public pension scheme, w h i c h pose a threat to fiscal sustainability. In
addressing these concerns, the government has been taking steps to reduce domestic debt
by clearing o f f a l l existing arrears to domestic suppliers, clearing a l l pension arrears and
undertaking legislative reform with the recent pension act.

73.      I n addition to attempting to cement the moderate gains achieved in
macroeconomic stability the government i s also pursuing reforms to improve service
delivery by the public sector. Since the early 1990s the government has been slowly but
steadily implementing public service reforms through the Public Service Reform Program
(PSRP). Some progress has been made over the years in public service downsizing, pay
reform for senior public service employees, certain aspects o f public sector restructuring
such as the privatization and commercialization o f parastatals, and in undertaking initial
reforms in public financial management, such as the introduction o f a payroll
management and establishment control system, a financial management system, and the
introduction o f a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). However, GRZ
continues to struggle with the management of, and i t s accountability for, public
resources. Deficiencies persist in most areas o f the public financial management cycle,
f r o m Parliamentary oversight and budget preparation t o internal controls and external
auditing. Public institutions are s t i l l very weak, with limited implementation capacity
resulting in poor service delivery. In an effort to boost the PSRP process the government
presented the second phase o f the reforms to i t s cooperating partners in September 2003.
The PSRP n o w has three distinct components, namely, PEMFA, Public Service
Management (PSM), and Decentralization.

74.    The PRSC program will support the broader reform agenda in the areas o f
pension reform, the clearing o f domestic arrears, compensation reform, payroll
management, and budget execution. Progress in these areas will enable the country t o
achieve some o f the broad macroeconomic objectives required for fiscal sustainability
and the reduction o f domestic debt t o sustainable levels, as w e l l as promoting financial
and budgetary accountability.

(i) Macroeconomic Management

75.     The Public Service Pension Fund. The FNDP (as well as the t w o previous DPLs,
E M G C Iand III4) recognizes that the challenges faced by the two public sector pension
funds, Le., the PSPF and the Local Annuities Superannuation Fund (LASF), pose a risk to
macroeconomic and financial sustainability. The PSPF i s an occupational pension
scheme, which has faced several actuarial constraints due to the government owing
considerable amounts in contribution arrears.

76.      The government has initiated a series of policy actions to address the
situation, which also include a plan to liquidate arrears owed to the PSPF. In order to
correct the imbalance between contribution and benefit accrual rates Article 124 o f the
Constitution, which specifically protects accrued benefits, will need to be revised. The
necessary revisions are included in the proposed amendments to the Constitution
prepared by the Constitutional Review Commission (CRC). Once adopted, a revision o f
benefits can be implemented and PSPF and LASF can be put o n sound financial footing.
In the meantime, to ensure that PSPF can continue to pay benefits until the amendments
have been adopted the government in the FNDP and the MTEF has agreed: (i) reduce to
i t s contribution arrears to PSPF annually during the 2008-10 period; and (ii)     not to
accumulate any significant new pension arrears by enrolling all new employees in the
National Pension Scheme (NAPSA), which i s privately owned. PSPF and LASF have
also taken measures to reduce their administrative costs, and the authorities have agreed
to a phased pay-down o f their contribution arrears such that benefits can continue to be
paid out. W h i l e amendments to the constitution are pending, (they are expected to be
passed in 2010), a business plan evaluating the options for restoring solvency was
prepared by PSPF in 2008 and i s expected to be publicly discussed by the end o f 2009.

77.      The PRSC will support the government's efforts in the area of Pension
Reform, which will in turn support the preservation of fiscal sustainability.
Significant resources could be freed-up once the constitutional amendment to the pension
act i s passed, and could be used towards other poverty-reducing activities outlined in the
FNDP.

PRSC-1 Prior Action: The MTEF commitment to funding the PSPF i s maintained, such
that the value o f arrears owed to the PSPF i s no larger than Z M K 9 3 billion.

(ii) Public Service Reform

78.      The PRSC will support the government's efforts to improve service delivery
through the implementation of service delivery charters as service contracts
between government institutions and their clients. The creation and institutionalization
o f service delivery charters for no less than t e n government institutions i s planned to be
completed by 20 10.

l4See Appendix 1 o f the EMGC program document, No. 29294 ZA, for a detailed description. Note that
both funds are closed to new entrants. New civil service hiresjoin the National Pension Scheme Authority
(NAPSA), which was established in 2000 and serves the private sector and the new hires in the civil
service.

                                                   29
79.     Service Delivery Charters Institutionalized in the Public Service. Service
delivery charters outline the level o f service delivery expected f r o m government
institutions and sets clear efficiency benchmarks. Government institutions have
developed w o r k processes reviews and reengineering methods under the Service Delivery
Implementation Fund (SDIF). This program also includes the Code o f Ethics for the
Public Service, w h i c h outlines core values and behavioral standards f o r ethical conduct
by public service employees in an effort to fight corruption and enhance popular
confidence in the public service. Additionally, guidelines for the administration o f
government business have been developed.

PRSC-1 Prior Action: Service delivery charters for the Ministry o f Lands and the
Department o f Immigration are adopted and institutionalized.

80.     The Development o a Public Service Pay Policy. Efforts have been made to
                             f
enhance salaries and the conditions o f service for public employees since the early 1990s.
These efforts, however, have been ad-hoc in nature and were undertaken largely in
response to sectoral pressures. They have also lacked a systematic approach and policy
context and have lagged behind inflationary trends. The result i s a pay regime
disconnected f r o m the market, a demoralized workforce, and poor quality o f service
delivery. The lack o f properly motivated and skilled staff has been reflected in limited
government effectiveness and identified as a cause o f market coordination failures that
constrain the growth potential o f the country. Hence there i s widespread recognition o f
the need for an immediate comprehensive pay policy as a means o f attracting and
retaining quality staff and motivating improved w o r k performance. As part o f the PSRP a
Medium-Term Pay Reform Strategy (MTPRS) was developed, but i t has not yet been
fully implemented. Under PSM, the government will continue implementing the M T P R S
and will develop a comprehensive pay policy linked to employee performance. The
government plans t o utilize a phased approach in the implementation o f the
comprehensive p a y policy.

8 1.   Recognizing that an ineffective public service has been a binding constraint
to social service delivery and has hindered economic growth in Zambia, the PRSC
will support the government's efforts to design and implement a comprehensive pay
policy. This policy will require institutional restructuring o f the public service and
support the creation o f an efficient and motivated w o r k force. This will improve overall
government p o l i c y implementation capacity, w h i c h i s currently inconsistent in nature.

PRSC-1 Prior Action: Draft Comprehensive Pay Policy completed and submitted for
discussion, with i t s requirements reflected in the 2009 Budget.

(iii)Public Financial Management

82.     As part of the PSRP, the PEMFA reform program targets improvements in
treasury management, the public procurement processes, and budget execution.
GRZ has undertaken efforts to reform budget preparation and execution in order to
establish a more transparent and credible budgeting process and supporting budget
documents. As part o f these efforts GRZ i s expected to implement the budget with

                                              30
greater precision, reducing the variance between the budget documents and actual
spending. Under the PFM cluster the P A F also focuses o n budget execution,
accountability, and the clearing o f arrears: areas w h i c h the PRSC will support.

83.      Budget Execution. The budget execution objective i s to achieve a percent
calculated expenditure o f between 95 percent and 105 percent o f total funding at each
budget head. Budget execution has continued to be a major weakness in the budget
process. The release o f funds i s usually unsystematic, unpredictable, and inadequate,
making it difficult for ministries, departments, and institutions to execute their planned
activities. Weaknesses in public procurement systems have also contributed to poor
budget execution, as the sectors only begin the procurement process once M o F N P has
released the funds. These weaknesses are reflected in the recent PEFA (2008), w h i c h
shows that while modest improvements have been made in the average variance o f
Ministry, Parastatals, and Spending Agency (MPSA) outturns, total budget variance
remains high.

84.        The PRSC will support the government's efforts in improving public finance
management in the area o f budget execution. The PRSC i s designed to aid the
government's efforts in releasing resources in a timely manner and t o enable sectoral
implementation o f identified priority programs. Specific actions will involve the
development and implementation o f a cash management plan and improved budget
preparation at each ministry (head) for every quarter. The plan should include a l l
spending and spending commitments for the period as set out in the budget. The M o F N P
w o u l d in turn be responsible for releasing these funds in a timely manner. Future budget
preparations at ministry level should be aligned with this policy and be realistic as t o
avoid large variances. These actions will ensure that actual expenditures at each budget
head are within a +/-5 percent variance, substantially improving the credibility o f the
budget.

PRSC-1 Prior Action: Enhancement o f overall financial management and establishment
o f commitment control systems such that the percent o f heads whose calculated
expenditure i s between 95 percent and 105 percent o f the total funding i s greater than 82
percent.

85.    Domestic Arrears. As a result o f a previously weak commitment to financial
control and management systems GRZ accumulated substantial arrears to i t s contractors.
Over the past five years GRZ has been making steady progress in reducing these arrears.
Under the P A F program for 2008-2010 and the MTEF for 2008-2010 the government has
committed itself to clearing a l l o l d arrears (Le., those accumulated up to December 31,
2002, w h i c h originally amounted to ZMK674 billion) by the end o f the period and has
earmarked substantial resources to cover these commitments.

86.      The PRSC will support the government's policy actions in this area,
improving the government's credibility vis-&vis its domestic suppliers and reverse
the crowding-out effect o f the domestic arrears o n private investment. The clearing
o f arrears to domestic suppliers will provide an important capital infusion to the private
sector, giving domestic f i r m s the necessary resources to pursue other economic activities.

                                             31
The specific actions that will be undertaken by the GRZ t o deal with arrears accumulated
since December 31, 2002 will include assuming and processing the payment o f the
arrears after an appropriate verification and approval process by the M o F N P . T o avoid
the accumulation o f similar arrears in the future GRZ will continue to implement
commitment control systems in i t s line ministries, allowing commitment requisitions to
be submitted, approved and recorded in an expenditure ledger before payments are
authorized (with appropriate commitment ceilings); GRZ will enforce compliance with
the commitment limits and maintain arrears reports verified by the Controller o f Internal
Auditing (based o n balances recorded in the arrears database).

PRSC-1 P r i o r Action: Domestic arrears to suppliers verified and approved by the
Ministry o f Finance and National Planning and the total balance o f arrears reduced t o
Z M K l 9 3 billion.

87.        By focusing o n t h e r e f o r m s in t h e three above-mentioned areas the P R S C
p r o g r a m will s u p p o r t the government's FNDP objective o f securing a n d sustaining
fiscal stability and deepening s t r u c t u r a l reforms necessary f o r achieving greater
economic growth. The reforms will also support the government's accountability and
governance agenda articulated in the FNDP.

      PILLAR 2: SUPPORTING BROAD-BASEDGROWTH IMPROVING EFFICIENCY
                                               BY
        I N THE ENERGYSECTOR AND REDUCING THE COST OF DOINGBUSINESS

88.     T h e P R S C p r o g r a m will s u p p o r t b r o a d regulatory r e f o r m s designed t o
enable p r i v a t e sector-driven, pro-poor, and broad-based growth. The credit will
support long-overdue reforms in business licensing, w h i c h will improve the business
climate by reducing transaction costs and promoting business formalization, coupled with
reforms in the energy sector focusing o n increasing the utility's efficiency and expanding
access to electricity. Improved efficiency and cost-recovery in the energy sector will
allow for much-needed private investment in the sector, investment w h i c h will be crucial
to the success o f Zambia's economic growth and diversification efforts.

(iv) Private Sector Development

89.    O n e o f t h e k e y elements o f the FNDP i s i t s focus o n p r o m o t i n g p r i v a t e sector
development by i m p r o v i n g the business a n d investment climate. The business
reforms being spearheaded under the Private Sector Development (PSD) program, which
began in 2004, are aimed at providing an enabling environment for private sector growth
while addressing impediments t o both interregional and international trade.

90.         The government, in collaboration with the private sector, has been
u n d e r t a k i n g r e f o r m s in business licensing u n d e r t h e P S D p r o g r a m since 2004.
Business licensing reform i s intended to eliminate a significant number o f licensing
requirements, to make the licensing regime simpler and more transparent, and to make
licensing consistent with legitimate regulatory practices. A process for licensing reform
for the period 2008-2009 has already been drawn up. The reform process combines the
"guillotine approach", whereby a l l licenses that are not legal o r necessary are eliminated

                                                     32
by default, with a quantitative target for reducing the administrative burdens for a l l
remaining licenses. The actions t o be undertaken are: (i) identification and review o f
                                                         the
a l l business licenses in Zambia and the determination o f appropriate recommendations
for reform; (ii)the implementation o f agreed licensing reforms, including the
establishment o f an e-registry and screening mechanism t o ensure that a l l n e w licensing
regulations are appropriate; and (iii)   the development o f a medium-term regulatory
reform strategy. In 2008 the License Working Group undertook the f i r s t phase o f the
reform process. In 2009 a baseline o f a l l licenses to be eliminated was established and a
mechanism for reducing compliance costs will be determined afterwards.

91.       P R S C s u p p o r t f o r this r e f o r m process will enable t h e c o u n t r y t o address a
m a j o r constraint t o p r i v a t e sector p a r t i c i p a t i o n and enable t h e achievement o f t h e
country's g o a l o f p r i v a t e sector-driven economic g r o w t h . Licensing reform will
increase the profitability and promote the expansion o f existing businesses while
allowing for the legitimization o f numerous micro, small, and medium enterprises
currently excluded f r o m the formal private sector by a prohibitively burdensome and
expensive licensing process.

compliance with business licenses as part o f a wider process o f regulatory reform
submitted to the cabinet.

(v) E n e r g y

92.         T h e i m p o r t a n c e o f r e f o r m in t h e energy sector and t h e necessity o f p r o v i d i n g
w i d e s p r e a d access t o electricity a r e recognized in t h e FNDP as c r i t i c a l to economic
g r o w t h , social w e l f a r e , and p o v e r t y reduction. In the early 1980s Zambia enjoyed a
large surplus power capacity due to l o w economic activity and minimal domestic
consumption. Today Zambia i s faced with an electricity deficit, which poses a serious
threat to the sustainability o f the economic gains made in recent years, yet n o major
investments in n e w generation capacity have been made since the 1970s. The national
electrification rate remains at approximately 20 percent nationwide and at only 2 to 3
percent in rural areas. The PAF includes t w o indicators for energy, which have been
agreed upon by the cooperating partners and the government. Neither i s a strong indicator
o f reform per se, but they do reflect a long process o f discussion within the sector, and
the policy that they support, w h i c h i s included in the PAF, i s the implementation o f a
multi-year performance-based t a r i f f framework that i s consistent with the government's
commitment t o achieving cost-reflective electricity tariffs. These measures also derive
f r o m the country's prior experience with performance indicators, for which the
government was unable to provide accurate, up-to-date information. The revised
indicators, by contrast, are both measurable and reliable. Recent changes in the leadership
o f ZESCO have enabled the Bank t o engage in a more constructive dialogue with b o t h
the n e w Board o f Directors and the new management team. The recent 35percent
average tariff increase was a step in the right direction and i s a clear signal o f a renewed
spirit o f engagement between ZESCO and i t s government regulator. The development o f
a strategic plan within ZESCO should further help to advance tariff-adjustment and other
key issues in the future. This will help to create an environment in which efficiency

                                                         33
improvements will translate into increased revenue for the utility and increased energy
access for the population.

93.       Since the development of its main hydro-power stations in the mid-1960's
Zambia has not invested in new electricity generation. However, over the last decade
economic activity has grown substantially, and was supported by the revival o f the
mining sector in the last decade. As a result overall domestic demand has increased
exponentially since the 1960s. A reliable, secure, and sustainable supply o f electricity
will be vital for sustained economic growth. The Rural Electrification Master Plan
estimates that rural electrification alone will require US$1 billion, or US$50 m i l l i o n per
year f r o m 2008 to 2030. A commercially-oriented and sustainable regulatory framework
will be needed to achieve these targets. The current tariff system, w h i c h does not recover
the cost o f supply, discouraging private investment the sector, also limits current public
investments in network maintenance, n e w generation, and access expansion.

94.        I n response to the electricity crisis the government has developed a strategy
to address short-, medium-, and long-term issues in the energy sector. This strategy
calls for significant investment (both public and private) and commits t o a program for
m o v i n g tariffs toward cost-recovery levels and for promoting broader private
participation in the sector. The Energy Regulation Board ( E m ) has agreed with ZESCO
o n a series o f performance benchmarks. Adopted in 2007, these provide a multi-year
incentive tariff framework based o n the use o f self-enforcing incentives that are
embedded in the electricity tariff decision-making framework and are aimed at improving
both profitability and service delivery. In early 2009, in recognition o f the importance o f
an efficient energy sector t o support private sector development and wealth creation, the
government included some o f the actions to be undertaken by ZESCO under the
electricity strategy as part o f the core structural agenda outlined in the PAF (2008-2010).
In the 2009 Budget the government has also committed t o move to a cost-recovery
electricity t a r i f f by 2010, and electricity tariffs were raised by 3 5 percent in 2009. The
PRSC will support the government's policy actions in the electricity sector, which
are principally aimed at improving the efficiency of ZESCO and increasing
household access to electricity. The first energy indicator in the PAF to be supported by
the PRSC i s the increase in the total number o f n e w domestic customers served by
ZESCO. The actions t o undertaken by ZESCO will also contribute to the overall growth
o f the sector and, together with other actions included in the Key Performance Indicators
agreed u p o n with the regulator, will improve ZESCO's financial performance.

PRSC-1 Prior Action: Achievement o f the government's Electricity Strategy objective
o f 18,000 n e w domestic connections to the ZESCO grid.

95.     The PRSC also supports the government's policy actions in the electricity
sector to reduce the number of unmetered customers in order to further improve
the efficiency of ZESCO. The second energy indicator in the PAF that the PRSC will
support i s the decrease in the total number o f unmetered customers served by ZESCO.
Progress in this area will improve the efficiency o f the sector and decrease financial
losses, b o t h o f w h i c h are important goals o f the FNDP and will be essential to putting the


                                                34
electric utility in a sustainable path by attracting much-needed private investment.
Without these reforms Zambia's growth prospects will be significantly limited.

PRSC-1 Prior Action: Achievement o f the Electricity Strategy objective o f reducing the
number o f ZESCO customers who are unmetered to less than 114.000.

                             D. THEPROPOSED PROGRAM (PRSC 1)

96.    This operation will focus on supporting components of the government
program as outlined in the PAF (2008-2010) and (2009-2011) in the areas o f wealth
creation, macroeconomic management, and public-sector reform. These components
will contribute t o achieving the results specified in the CAS and F N D P (see Annex 3).
Accordingly, the proposed program has selected eight prior actions in the areas
mentioned above. These are:

     1. Macroeconomic Management:

        As part o f the pension reform process the government has implemented a plan to
        reduce arrears owed to PSPF. Accordingly, M o F N P has reduced contribution
        arrears owed by GRZ to PSPF t o Z M K 9 3 billion.

     2. Public Sector Reform:

        As part o f the PSRP, and in order to improve the efficiency and accountability o f
        the public service, (a) the government has drafted a performance-based pay policy
        that supports and reinforces improved service delivery, and [b) service delivery
        charters are to be established in t w o public-sector institutions.

     3. Public Financial Management:

        As part o f the PSRP, and in order to improve budget execution and enhance the
        government's credibility with domestic suppliers, (a) M o F N P has established
        greater predictability in budget execution by ensuring that 82 percent o f headsI5,
        (i.e., 36 o f 45 heads), have calculated expenditures o f between 95 percent and 105
        percent o f total funding for fiscal year 2008; and (b) M o F N P has reduced domestic
        arrears t o suppliers t o Z M K 1 9 3 b i l l i o n as o f end 2008.

     4. Cost o Doing Business:
              f

        As part o f the Private Sector Development (PSD) reforms a strategy for reducing
        the administrative cost o f compliance with business licenses has been submitted to
        the Cabinet.

     5. Energy:


15
 Heads are the different units in which the public sector i s organized from a budget perspective, including
ministries and government agencies.

                                                    35
     As part o f the implementation o f the government's electricity strategy, and in order
     to improve household access to electricity and increase the operational efficiency o f
     ZESCO, GRZ has agreed to: (a) the inclusion o f an indicator in the P A F 2008-2010
     that monitors the number o f new customers added to ZESCO's grid, which reached
     18,000 in 2008; and (b) the inclusion o f an indicator in the PAF 2008-2010 that
     monitors the reduction in the number o f unmetered customers, which f e l l to less
     than 114,000 in 2008.

A summary ofprior actions and trippers for the PRSC series is presented in Table 4.

97.     The program of reforms has continued beyond what has been achieved by
end-2008. Even though most o f the prior actions correspond to outcomes achieved at the
end o f 2008, and some o f them during 2009, these outcomes are part o f a reform program
that has a track record and continues to be developed. In the case o f the reduction o f
arrears to the PSPF, these have continually fallen since 2005 and are estimated to have
fallen to around ZMK5O billion by end-2009. In the case o f predictability o f budget
execution and that budget heads expend between 95 percent and 105 percent o f their total
budgetary allocated fbnding, it has continued to improve in 2005, when i t reached 55
percent, to more than 82 percent in 2008 and i s estimated to have reached 85 percent in
2009. Domestic arrears have also continuously fallen from ZMK533 billion in 2005 to
ZMK193 billion in 2008 and are estimated to have fallen to less than Z M K l 0 0 billion in
2009. The Key performance indicators used to measure the operational efficiency o f
ZESCO, including the two prior actions o f total new connections per year and the total
number o f unmetered customers, have, in the case o f the first, continued to increase, and,
in the case o f the second, continue to fall by preliminary end-2009 data.

98.     With the implementationof this set of reforms the program aims, by the end
of the third year of the PRSC series, to have a comprehensive pay policy fully
implemented and to have increased the number o f service delivery charters in the public
sector to include no less than eight government institutions, according to the public sector
reforms. Regarding public finance management, the percentage o f heads whose
calculated expenditure i s between 95 and 105 percent o f total funding i s to be no less than
85 percent, with the IFMIS extended to no less than 24 sites. In macroeconomic
management, the PRSC stipulates that the value o f arrears owed to the PSPF must be
equivalent to no more than two months o f the value o f employer contributions and that an
agreement will be reached on pension rights for new entrants to the system so as to
stabilize the pension deficit. In the energy sector, the program aims at full
implementation o f the government's electricity strategy, including cost-reflective tariffs
and improvements in the operational efficiency o f ZESCO. The operation will monitor
this against a target increase in the number o f new domestic connections in 2010 by at
least 10 percent o f the total number o f customers by end-2009, and a reduction in the
number o f ZESCO clients that are unmetered to no more than 40,000 by the end o f 2010.
In private sector development the compliance cost for business licenses, including labor
costs and out o f pocket expenses, will be reduced by at least 30 percent.

               VI. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                          A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

99.     The proposed PRSC-1 will have a positive, though indirect, effect on poverty
reduction through its support o f the government's efforts with regard to FNDP
implementation and continued growth. The PRSC will facilitate poverty reduction
through three primary channels. The first i s by assisting the government to maintain a
growth-conducive macroeconomic environment, which will provide the necessary
stability for poverty reduction and wealth creation. The second i s through i t s continued
support o f improved public sector management processes that could enhance the
government's ability to direct i t s scarce resources to expenditure programs designed to
reduce poverty. The third i s by contributing to broad-based growth through
improvements in the efficiency o f the energy sector, loosening the binding constraint o f
electricity production and reducing the cost o f doing business.

100.    The effect o f higher electricity tariffs on the poverty rate i s negligible. There
are two reasons for this: (a) under the current system run by ZESCO, the poor have
almost no access to electricity-according to recently revised data from the 2006 Living
Conditions Monitoring Survey only 6 percent or the rural population have access to the
electricity grid, and among the three lowest income quintiles electricity access i s only
around 2.5 percent; and (b) the electricity tariffs contain a cross-subsidy element by
maintaining a fixed price for the first kilowatt/hours o f consumption,

                B.   IMPLEMENTATION,     MONITORINGEVALUATION
                                                 AND

101. Implementation, monitoring, and evaluation o f the PRSC will be completed
in the context o f the assessment o f the PAF in collaboration with other donors. The
agreement reached between the cooperating partners and GRZ, which was made explicit
in the MoU for budget support, defines reporting requirements, bi-annual meetings to
discuss progress and possible revisions to the PAF, as well as institutional arrangements
and platforms for evaluation. In addition the cooperating partners have agreed to provide
budget support in a way that: (i)i s aligned with GRZ cycles for planning,
implementation, monitoring, reporting, and funding; (ii)     improves harmonization by
eliminating bilateral administrative and reporting requirements as well as bilateral
reviews; (iii)ensures the transparency o f conditions and funding; and (iv) enhances the
capacity o f GRZ to meet i t s commitments by providing appropriate technical assistance
and capacity building.

                                C. FIDUCIARY
                                           ASPECTS

102. Zambia's fiduciary framework i s adequate to support the proceeds o f the
credit, particularly in light o f the progress made in the P F M reform program being
undertaken under PEMFA and PAF: projects where the Bank i s offering support. The



                                            39
ongoing reforms under PEMFA and P A F will continue to strengthen the financial
management systems, providing further assurance regarding fiduciary aspects.

103. As noted above, a number o f diagnostic studies o f Zambia's Public Financial
Management (PFM) system have determined that the country's PFM system i s
challenged by several key weaknesses. These studies include the CFAA16 for November
2003 and the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments for
2005 and 2008.17 The P E M F A project has been addressing the weaknesses in PFM, but
while the reform progress has yielded only modest results so far, some notable
improvements have been achieved, including: (i)       commencement o f the IFMIS rollout;
(ii)an improved MTEF green paper; (iii)approved public procurement reform
legislation; (iv) the implementation o f activity-based budgeting; (v) the development o f a
revised chart o f accounts; (vi) a strengthened external auditing process; and (vii)
enhancements in parliamentary oversight, among others. The 2008 PEFA assessment
recorded improvements in transparency, comprehensiveness and accountability in fiscal
management, evidence that progress i s being made under the P E M F A project. Policies
designed to further address P F M weaknesses, mainly the public service pay reform and
budget execution, are also being supported by the PRSC.

104. An updated Safeguards Assessment o f the Bank o f Zambia was completed by
the IMF on January 13,2009. The assessment found that aspects o f the BoZ safeguards
framework have been strengthened since the previous assessment, completed in 2004.
Specifically, the BoZ had implemented International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS) in 2005 and recently strengthened i t s foreign reserves management and oversight.
Weak statutory independence, protracted external audit completion, and lack o f or
delayed publication o f audit information remain safeguard concerns. To address these
issues the assessment recommended that the BoZ:

           -   put in place year-end closing and audit-planning procedures to facilitate more
               rapid completion o f the annual external audit;

           -   enact legal amendments that address all legal safeguard concerns raised in the
               2004 safeguards report;

           -   publish the annual audited financial statements and audit opinion on the BoZ's
               external website no later than one month after audit completion;

           -   commission an external quality-assurance review o f the work practices o f the
               internal audit function and the oversight exercised by the BoZ Audit
               Committee;




l6     A comprehensive Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR)
      was carried out by the Government o f the Republic o f Zambia with the support o f cooperating partners
      and the World Bank in November 2003.
17
      The Government o f Zambia has carried out an internal assessment o f the PFM system based on PEFA
     indicators finalized in 2005 and in 2008.

                                                      40
       -   mandate that the external audit firm, in coordination with the Internal Audit
           Department, verify unissued currency in vaults at year-end and reconcile the
           confirmed balances to supporting documentation from the printing f i r m s ;

       -   request that, the MoFNP fill the vacant seat on the Board by appointing a
           person with professional experience in accounting and auditing, who should
           also serve on the Audit Committee; and

       -   implement a review o f a l l program data for accuracy, and for consistency with
           the technical memorandum o f understanding, conducted by BoZ' s Internal
           Audit Department.

                           D. DISBURSEMENT AUDITING

                                        AD

Disbursements

 105. A single-tranche credit of US$20 million equivalent will be made available
upon the Credit's effectiveness. The proposed credit will follow the Bank's
disbursement procedures for development policy lending. Once the credit i s approved by
the Bank's Board o f Executive Directors and becomes effective, and upon receipt o f a
withdrawal application signed by an authorized signatory, the proceeds will be deposited
by IDA in an United States dollar account designated by the GRZ at the BoZ. The credit
proceeds will form part o f the country's foreign exchange reserves. Within two business
days, the BoZ will credit the Zambian kwacha (ZMK) equivalent o f the credit proceeds to
the consolidated accounts maintained on behalf o f the GRZ for budget execution. The
Accountant-General will be notified accordingly. The BoZ will not impose any charges
or commission on the GRZ for these transactions. The conversion from United States
dollars to Zambian kwacha will be based on the prevailing exchange rate on the date that
the funds are credited to the consolidated account. The government, through the MoFNP,
will: (i)provide written confirmation to IDA within 30 days that an amount equivalent to
the credit proceeds from IDA has been credited to the consolidated account along with an
indication o f the exchange rate applied; (ii) provide evidence that the ZMK equivalent o f
the credit proceeds was recorded as financing the GRZ budget; and (iii)      ensure that the
ZMK equivalent o f the credit proceeds are subject to effective controls sufficient to
ensure its use for eligible, budgeted public expenditures only as per the Credit
Agreement. If the proceeds o f the credit are used for ineligible purposes, IDA will require
the GRZ to promptly refund an amount equal to the total o f the ineligible expenditures.
The refunded amount will be cancelled, thereby reducing the amount o f the credit. The
administration o f the credit shall be the responsibility o f the MoFNP.

Auditing

106. The use of the kwacha equivalent of Credit proceeds to support budgetary
expenditures will be subject to audit by the Auditor General as provided for by the
Zambian Constitution. The Bank will have access to these audit reports. The annual
financial statements o f Central Bank o f Zambia are audited in accordance with
International Standards o f Auditing and the financial statements are publicly available.

                                           ASPECTS
                             E. ENVIRONMENTAL

107. Environmental Impact. The first set o f triggers i s linked to public
administration. The policy goals are enhanced productivity o f civil servants and greater
efficiency in the use o f public funds. The impact o n the environment i s neutral. The
energy triggers are designed to support the government's energy policy and in particular
to effect improvements in the governance and efficiency o f ZESCO. One indicator will
require an absolute increase in electrical grid coverage which, in Zambia, can only result
from an increase in power generation. The potential environmental consequences o f this
should be positive, on balance. O n the one hand, an increase in the number o f
connections could be beneficial to the environment by providing an energy alternative to
charcoal, with positive impacts on deforestation and indoor air pollution. O n the other
hand, the construction and/or upgrading o f hydroelectric dams, or increased non-
hydropower generation, could have a range o f negative consequences for the
environment. The country regulatory systems and environmental legislation to mitigate
adverse policy impacts i s normally adequate, with suitable legislation o n environmental
impact assessment (EIA) and corresponding institutions. Their shortcomings include: (i)
a legal loop-hole that enables the reversal o f the Environment Council o f Zambia's
decisions, and (ii)  the lack o f compliance with and/or enforcement o f decision on
adaptation or mitigation o f industrial, mining or large-scale agriculture operations. The
government has committed to adopting a new Environment Policy and to maintaining a
dialogue with the Bank and PRSC financiers on improved enforcement o f i t s own
environmental legislation.

                            F.   R I S K S AND R I S K MITIGATION

108. Political Risk. The newly-elected government i s not immune to populist
pressures and the allure o f short-term political gains. This could potentially affect the
steady, consistent direction needed to effectively implement the measures supported by
the PRSC in general, and the energy strategy reforms in particular. These political
constrains could affect both the establishment o f a cost-recovery tariff and the necessary
improvements in ZESCO's operating efficiency. To mitigate these challenges IDA,
through the activities identified under the CAS FY2008-11, and specifically in the
ongoing policy dialogue with the energy sector-including IFC's support on the design
o f a new hydroelectric power plant-has contributed to changing the direction o f the
energy policy and could continue assisting the government to implement i t s energy
strategy.

109. Lower-Than-Expected Growth and Macroeconomic Instability. Despite
significant improvements in Zambia's fiscal stance the ongoing effects o f the global
financial crisis and ineffective public-expenditure management processes could generate
risks to macroeconomic performance and imperil the required reform efforts in the public
pension system. I t i s not clear that there will be consensus on h o w to respond to such a
circumstance and, more importantly, that the political resolve by the government to tackle
difficult issues involved in the reform process will be present. However, the new three-

                                            42
year PRGF arrangement with the IMF and monitoring o f budget execution through the
PRBS-related biannual reviews will assist in addressing these potential risks.

110. Governance Issues. The cooperating partners raised key issues and concerns
regarding the underlying principles o f the Memorandum o f Understanding between the
budget support group and the Government o f Zambia. The principles under discussion
were the GRZ's commitment to public financial management and good governance.
These issues, such as the decreased funding to anti-corruption agencies, issues
surrounding road-sector investments and the embezzlement o f funds in the Ministry o f
Health, prompted an agreement between the GRZ and the donors t o initiate a dialogue in
June 2009 regarding the formulation o f a Roadmap with concrete milestones and well-
defined responsibilities. At the PRBS dialogue o n November 25, 2009 the cooperating
partners determined that satisfactory progress had been made against the Roadmap and
the formal dialogue ended with the confirmation o f donor commitments t o the 2010
budget. However, concerns about some o f the advances in governance reform remain,
and the cooperating partners indicated that for actual disbursements to occur GRZ must
continue to demonstrate i t s commitment to the underlying principles o f good governance.
T o mitigate the risk o f weakening governance, the dialogue between the cooperating
partners and the government i s expected to continue.

111.     Implementation Capacity. The government's weak track record in policy
implementation, specifically in terms o f policies linked to public sector reform, the c i v i l
service payment system, and budget execution in public finance management, could
derail the reform efforts. To mitigate those risks an ongoing Public Expenditure Review
i s being implemented by IDA in cooperation with the government, other donors, and the
PEMFA program, w h i c h i s specifically designed to assist the authorities t o improve
institutional capacity and the management o f public finances.

112.    HIV/AIDS Pandemic. H I V / A I D S remains the most significant health threat to
Zambia's population and, indirectly, t o i t s prosperity. The impact o f the disease i s
increasingly visible in a l l spheres o f Zambia's society and economy. With prevalence
rates remaining in double-digit figures, the potential damage i s enormous. The PAF, and
thus the PRSC, monitors the government's efforts to fight the pandemic, and the Bank's
C A S FY08-11 requires that issues concerning H I V / A I D S are part o f each IDA operation.

     Dew Mr. Zoellick,


     1. Iam writing to request 011 behali of' the Gover~iineiito f the Republic of Zambia, a
        credit o f IIS$20 miliioii equivalent fiom the InternationaI Develnpineiit Association
        (IDA) in support o f our ongoing reform cfforts. This Ciedjl, the First Poverty
        Rediictioii Support Credit (PRSC I): to help Zambia sustain the ecoiioiiiic gains
                                                  aims
        i t has achieved over the last few years aiid further entiance our capabilities to sustain
        erowtli and rediice poverty, while providing us with fiiiaticial resources that w i l l be
        ;sed for to implement the f i n a l year of the Fifth National Developtnciit Plan (FNDP).

                                 Fifth N:itional Develapnient Plan

     2   Jn Jaiiuaiy 2007, out Govemmeiit lauiiched our FiNi National Development Plan
         (FNDP), which i s Zambia's second Poveity Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) Cor the
         period 2006-2010. Our FNDP i s guided by the National Vision 2030 (NV2030),
         which has as i t s goal to transform Zaitibia in to "a prosperous middle income cotintry
         by the ycar 2030 " The FNDP i s organised around the theme of "broad-based wealth
         and job c1catioi-r lhrough citizenry pal ticipation and tecliiiological advancement" aiid
         it focuses on "cconoiiiic i n f m t r i i c f u i e and human resouices development".

     .3. The FNDP builds upon the achievements of the first PRSP, for example, strong
         improveiiients in inacroecoiiomjc perforniance and progress in public expenditure
         management. The FNDP iias a straigtiicned focus on key issues relevant for
         Zambia's development, emphasizcs achieving tangible cesuIts, and includes
         monitoiing and evaluation arrangeinents. On policies, i t continues lu place emphasis
         011 (he importance o f a stable mncroeconomic fianicwork, improved domestic revenue




                                                   44
   collection, good goveinance, increased production and productivity in agriculture,
   and strengthened human resource development.

4. The preparation of tlie FNDP was highly participatory. A l l the major stakeholders        -
   civil society, cooperating partncrs, the private sector, permanent secretaries, inembers
   o f parliament and the Cabinet-were involved in the preparation of the strategy. The
   priorities were arrived at through a series o f consultative meetings with Sector
   Advisory Working Groups (SAGs) and other key stakeholders. This consultative
   process integrated the views o f 21 SAGs and included the preparation of 72 district
   development plans that were approved by the respective provincial and district
   Development Coordinating Committees. Consequently the FNDP has a high degree
   o f ownership.

5. The importance o f institutional frameworks for implemeutation, monitoring and
   evaluation are acknowledged and prioxitized by the FNDP The Planning and
   Economic Management Division (PEMD) of the Ministry o f Finance and National
   Planning has served as the focal point for institutional linkages. I t has institutioiialised
   five-year development planning as the means to guide the budget preparation process.
   With the forinal creation of the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit under PEMD during
   the implementation o f tlie first PRSP, the Plan seeks to iiistitutioiialise a system to
   monitor inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts so that resources are strategically
   managed and progress tracked. In particular, nionitoring and evaluation processes will
   provide essential data and insights for drawing lessons, priority setting and for an
   informed review o f the FNDP implementation.

                              Macroeconomic Environment

6. Zambia's macroeconomic environment has improved significantly over the last five
   years, with end-year inflation in the single digits for three of the last five years, and
   fiscal deficits well within sustainable limits. The Government i s committed to
   maintaining and building on these achievements, which i s an important objective o f
   the FNDP The IMF has piovided assistance to GRZ thiough its ECF (foinierly
   PRGF) arrangement to reach this positive position. The current ECF ariangement
   commenced in 2008, and will conclude in 201 1

                       The Performance Assessment Framewoi-k

7. I n line with tlie Government's aspirations in tlie Aid Policy and Paris Declaration,
   Zambia's preferred mode o f aid delivery i s Geneial Budget Support I n this regard, a
   numbei of Cooperating Partners have provided funds in this manner through the
   deveIopinent and signing o f a Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU) for Poverty
   Reduction Budget Support (PRES). At present nine cooperating paitners have signed
   up to this MOU, namely tlie European Commission, DFID, Germany, Norway,
   Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, the World Bank, and the African Developmenl
   Bank while a number o f other partners have expiessed their interest to join in the
   short and medium term




                                        45
8. A framework has since been developed foi assessing performance under the PRBS
   MOU, refened to as the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) It provides the
   basis for discussions over the effectiveness o f PRBS on a bi-annual basis The PAF
   2008-2010 was developed after detailed consultations between the Ministiy o f
   Finance and National Planning (MOFNP), PRBS cooperating partners, and
   representatives from the various sector ministries/institutions The ministries also
   engaged in a furthei series of consultations, through the Sector Advisory Gioups
   (SAGS) i n their selection o f the indicators and areas for inclusion in the PAF

9. The Government and the PRBS donors meet twice a yew to review performance in
   relation to the agreed PAT; foi tlie previous year, and to agree the contents ofthe PAF
   for the next year The joint review meetings take place each year in June and October


     i. The June review meeting focuses on the PRBS donors and Government coming to
        a joint view on performance, which serves as the basis for commitments for the
        next budget year The review i s based on the National Development Plan's
        Annual Review, the annual Public Expenditure Management and Financial
        Accountability (PEMFA) piogress reports, Quarterly Budget Execution Reports
        and related informatioii, plus the national audits;

    ii. The October review meeting focuses on dialogue on forward planning and
         budgeting and agreement on the PAF for the next budget year This diaIogue i s
         based on the annual Financial Reports o f the previous budget year, tlie Annual
         PEFA Evaluation a i d the ceilings i n the annual budget for the next budget year,
         as specified i n Zambia's MTEF Green Paper During this Review meeting, each
         member of the PRBS Group confirms tlie volume o f its commitment. During this
         review meeting, Government and PRBS donors agree on the PAF for tlie next
         budget year, and any PRBS donor, i e IDA, intending to provide a floating
         element will confirm againsL the new PAF the specific milestones, indicators
         and/or targets that will trigger, when met, an inunediate disbursement at the
         relevant review meeting in the following year.

10 A t present there are 33 indicators and milestones included in the PAF covering foul
   aieas, namely:

              a   Refoim Piocess: Including decentralisation, public sector reform,
                  public finance management and inacroeconomic management;

              b. Wealth Creation: Including agriculture, road, energy and water

                                        46
11 Of these, 32 have been used to assess progress for 2008. The choice o f these four
   broad aieas is i n line with Fifth National Development Plan (FNDP) theme and
   stiategic focus Further, the indicators in the PAF are a subset o f the monitoring and
   evaluation framework o f the FNDP and are therefore fully consistent with the K e y
   Performance Indicators o f the FNDP

12. The review o f the PAF successfully took place i n September 2009 and Iattach for
    your information the report outlining progress made under the Performance
    Assessment Framework. This document provides for further detailed discussion o f
    the areas covered aiid the performance o f our Government against each o f the
    indicators evaluated.

13. The Government of llie Republic of Zambia believes that the measures listed in the
    PAF o f which the proposed IDA credit directly supports the critical subset, will
    contribute to achieve robust economic growth and poverty reduction within a
    sustainable niacroeconoinic framework. Further, the outlined policies programmes
    and reforms in the PAF will create a conducive environinent for the effective and
    efficient utiiisation of IDA assistance, and support the implementation of the final
    year o f the FNDP

14. As advanced piepar ations are underway to launch the Sixth National Development
    Plan, which will cover the years 2011-2015, Iwould like to use this oppoitunity to
    reaffirm the Government's appreciation o f the efforts of the Woild Bank in assisting
    with the nation's development objectives. I t is also my hope that as we move forwaid
    with the Sixth Plan, that the excellent working relationship and coninion purpose of
    ending poverty in Zambia will continue to flourish

I M F Executive Board Completes Third Review under the PRGF
Arrangement with Zambia and Approves US$81.2 Million
Disbursement
Press Release 09/458

December 14, 2009


The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the third
review of Zambia's economic performance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion of the review will enable the immediate
disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 51.013 million (about US$ 81.2 million),
bringing total disbursements to SDR 164.91 million (about US$ 262.5 million).

The PRGF arrangement for Zambia in the amount of SDR 48.91 million (about US$79.2
million) was originally approved in June 2008 ( see Press Release No. 08/134), and later
augmented by SDR171.185 million (about US$256,4 million) to SDR 220.095 million
(about US8329.7 million) in May 2009 (see Press Release No. 09/147).

The Executive Board today also concluded the 2009 Article I V consultation with Zambia.
A Public Information Notice and the staff report will be published in due course.
Following the Executive Board`s discussion, Mr, Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:

"The Zambian authorities are to be commended for their solid performance under the
PRGF-supported program. Their prudent macroeconomic management was demonstrated
by the Zambian economy's resilience t o the global economic crisis,

"The 2010 budget is well balanced. The authorities aim to create fiscal space for poverty
reducing expenditure and for infrastructure investment to sustain robust and diversified
growth. The authorities will review tax policy and administration, with a view to
broadening the tax base and reinforcing tax collection. The upward trend in the wage bill
needs to be reversed to free resources for other priority outlays and social spending.
Further reforms to enhance government spending efficiency are also needed.

"Zambia`s risk of debt distress is low and there is some scope for external borrowing on
non-concessional terms to finance the government's share in essential infrastructure
projects, particularly in electricity generation. The authorities plan to adopt a
comprehensive debt management strategy, which will ensure that external borrowing is
consistent with continued low risk of debt distress. The authorities are committed t o
improve aid management and to coordinate closely with donors.

"The floating exchange rate regime and reserve money-based monetary program have
served Zambia well. The authorities' plans to transition to an inflation targeting regime
should be premised on the establishment of the necessary preconditions. The authorities
aim to implement the second phase of their financial sector development plan to
enhance financial system stability and financial intermediation.




                                           48
"Attracting private sector investment in the electricity sector requires aligning tariffs with
cost recovery levels. Efforts t o strengthen the financial and operational efficiency of the
state-owned electricity utility ZESCO should be accelerated," added Mr. Portugal.
