BRAZIL
APPRAISAL OF THE SERGIPE NITROGEN FERTILIZER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project to produce nitrogen fertilizers
with a capacity of 907 tons per day of ammonia and 1,100 tons per day of
urea. The gas-based plant will be built in Northeast Brazil on a new site
at Laranjeiras, about 20 km northwest of Aracaju in the state of Sergipe
not far from the Atlantic ocean. The plant is expected to come on stream by
the beginning of 1981 and will increase Brazil's nitrogen capacity by about
one-fourth. The output from the plant will be primarily for the Northeastern
market and will be handled as at present by the private sector, primarily
existing bulkblending and mixing companies. The project is expected to
require financing of US$283 million equivalent, including US$102 million in
foreign exchange of which the proposed Bank loan would finance U$64 million.
ii.       The project is sponsored by Petrobras Fertilizantes S.A.
(FERTILIZANTES), a wholly owned subsidiary of Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.
(PETROBRAS). FERTILIZANTES was established in early 1976 with the objective
of consolidating PETROBRAS' existing and future fertilizer interests. Control
over PETROBRAS' three existing fertilizer companies has been transferred to
FERTILIZANTES at the beginning of 1977. PETROBRAS is deeply involved in the
production and distribution of nitrogen fertilizers and holds a virtual
monopoly of ammonia and urea production in Brazil. Recent participation of
the private sector in the production of new nitrogen fertilizer capacity did
not occur (as hoped for) and cannot be expected at this time because of the
very high capital requirements of new, large-scale plants, particularly when
compared to the low capitalization of the existing private fertilizer industry
in Brazil and the Government control of feedstock and fertilizer prices.
However, PETROBRAS intends to offer shares of FERTILIZANTES to the private
sector at a later stage.
iii.      The proposed loan would be the second Bank loan to FERTILIZANTES
and the Brazilian fertilizer sector. The first loan (US$50 million) was made
in May 1976 for the Araucaria ammonia/urea project, which is in the early
stages of implementation and is proceeding satisfactorily. Another project
(Valefertil) in this sector, though for phosphatic fertilizers and with
different project sponsors, is scheduled for consideration by the Bank's
Executive Directors at about the same time as this project.
iv.       Brazil's agricultural sector is characterized by extensive
agricultural practices and the country's rising output has resulted mainly
from expansions of cultivated area. Although it is expected that the area
under cultivation will continue to expand, agricultural growth will have to
depend increasingly on raising the productivity of existing land. Growth of
fertilizer consumption has been rapid but also erratic. Up to 1966 there was
little growth reflecting the Government's neglect of the agricultural and
fertilizer sector. Stimulating measures introduced in the mid-sixties



- ii -
brought six years of very rapid growth with annual increments averaging
35% through 1972. Over the following three years (1973-75), fertilizer
consumption grew modestly, primarily as a result of the sharp rise in inter-
national prices and the scarcity of fertilizer in the world market. For 1976
a significant recovery in fertilizer consumption occurred and total nutrient
consumption is estimated to have reached 2.3 million tons. Phosphatic
fertilizers account for nearly 50% of total nutrient consumption which is
agronomically justified on account of Brazilian soil characteristics and
cropping patterns. It is estimated that four crops (sugar, coffee, soybeans
and wheat) account for over half of total fertilizer consumption.
v.        On the supply side, domestic fertilizer production accounts for only
about 40% of consumption. The low level of domestic production has been due
to Brazil's lack or knowledge of easily exploitable fertilizer raw materials,
the rapidly rising capital requirements for the manufacture of chemical
fertilizers and the absence of specific Government policies for the develop-
ment of the fertilizer sector. As a consequence, the local fertilizer industry
has concentrated on importing, mixing, blending and distribution while only a
few companies have their own small-scale production facilities. To overcome
the country's dependency on imports, the Government has embarked on a National
Fertilizer Program establishing a target of self-sufficiency in nitrogenous
and phosphatic fertilizers by 1980 which includes a program for large, basic
production facilities of which the Araucaria, Sergipe and Valefertil projects
form part. Production costs of local fertilizers have generally been higher
than the cost of imports and the Government established an import quota
system, which is regularly revised, to ensure that all domestic production is
used. As the new, large-scale, efficient fertilizer plants enter into produc-
tion, costs of domestic fertilizers are expected to move, in the longer run,
in line with long-term international prices, thereby obviating the need for
the import quota system. Concerned about the impact of the high international
fertilizer prices during 1973-75 on its plans for increasing agricultural
output, the Government introduced a price subsidy to farmers in early 1975
which resulted in a significant recovery in consumption during 1976. However,
with the rapid decline of these prices during 1975 and 1976, the purchasing
power of agricultural products relative to fertilizer improved again and the
subsidy was eliminated in late December 1976. Removal of the subsidy is not
expected to affect demand beyond the first months in 1977 since the relation-
ship between agricultural product and fertilizer prices is still favorable and
is expected to remain so in the future.
vi.       In the absence of detailed historical data for the fertilizer
sector by region and crop, projections of future demand in Brazil are risky.
Assuming an average annual growth rate of about 11%, which compares to one
of 22% over the last ten years, total nutrient consumption can be expected
to reach a level of 3.4 and 5.7 million nutrient tons by 1980 and 1985,
respectively. The projected demand/supply balances indicate that the goal
of self-sufficiency can probably be met in the early 1980s for nitrogen
and phosphates; the domestic supply of potash is considerably more uncertain
and supply will probably continue through imports for some time in the future.



- iii -
vii.      The location of the plant will be just south of the main fertilizer
market of the Northeast, and it will be close to the onshore and offshore
oil and gas fields from which natural gas, the principal raw material for
the project, will be supplied. Reserves are adequate to allow for 15 years
of operation of the project. PETROBRAS already operates some oil and gas
transmission pipelines in this area, but will, outside the project, construct
a gas gathering and conservation scheme which will reduce gas losses and
boost supplies to users.
viii.     The project is based on modern, commercially proven technology, and
will be implemented for FERTILIZANTES by PETROBRAS' fertilizer project imple-
mentation unit supported by PETROBRAS' engineering department. Engineering
contracts, acceptable to the Bank, with Pullman Kellogg (US) and Toyo Engineer-
ing Company (Japan) have already been signed, and these companies will provide
process licenses, basic engineering, procurement assistance, and technical
advisory services relating to the ammonia unit and general site facilities,
and the urea unit, respectively. Detailed engineering will be undertaken by
two Brazilian engineering firms under the direct supervision of Kellogg and
Toyo. In agreement with the Government's and PETROBRAS' policy to support and
develop Brazilian industry, 60% of the equipment and materials required by the
project are to be procured locally, which is estimated, because of the higher
Brazilian costs, to increase the total equipment and material costs by about
11% and the total financing requirements by about 5%. The remaining 40% will
be procured in accordance with the Bank guidelines and will be financed by the
proposed Bank loan.
ix.       The project will be financed by 41% in equity from PETROBRAS (US$116
million) and 59% in long-term loans from: (i) the Bank (US$64 million); (ii)
a cofinancing arrangement which will be either with a foreign commercial bank
or a direct placement of FERTILIZANTES' debt obligations with private investors
in the US (US$25 million); (iii) from the National Development Bank (BNDE) for
the financing of local equipment, materials and services (US$71 million); and
(iv) from PETROBRAS (US$7 million).
x.        The project's financial rate of return is satisfactory at 19%
before and 15% after tax. Financial projections for the project also show
satisfactory results with adequate liquidity, debt service coverage and
debt/equity ratio. To safeguard the financial position of the project and of
FERTILIZANTES, certain financial covenants similar to the Araucaria project
have been agreed upon. The project's economic rate of return is calculated at
17% and would remain satisfactory even under the most adverse forseeable
circumstances. The project will contribute to the stabilization of the
agricultural sector by reliably providing fertilizers to the farmers at
stable prices. In addition, the positive spillover effects from the required
infrastructure will benefit this region which is one of Brazil's poorest and
least industrialized. The local engineering and manufacturing industry will
also benefit, and the project's net annual foreign exchange savings are
estimated at US$65 million.



-iv -
xi.       Few major risks are seen in the project.  It is unlikely that the
project will face major management problems since PETROBRAS has experience
in executing similar projects. Engineering and technological risks are also
minimal since proven processes are used and Kellogg and Toyo are internation-
ally recognized. Financially, the project is largely dependent on Government
controls regarding the input and output prices and the Government has agreed
that it will not take any action that would prevent FERTILIZANTES from operat-
ing on a sound financial basis. A marketing risk exists in so far as
FERTILIZANTES has to rely on others, i.e. the bulkblending and mixing companies
to market its products in the Northeast. However, the fertilizer distribution
function has so far been attractive enough to the private sector to bring
about the needed investments and sales efforts; this situation is expected to
continue. Also, FERTILIZANTES is establishing its own market analysis and
marketing group to closely monitor the developments in the sector; both
therefore should minimize the marketing risk.
xii.      On the basis of the agreements which have been obtained with the
Government, PETROBRAS and FERTILIZANTES, the project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$64 million to FERTILIZANTES, for 15 years including four years of
grace at the Bank's prevailing interest rate to which a fee payable to the
Government would be added increasing the cost to FERTILIZANTES to 10%.



I. INTRODUCTION
A.   Background
1.01      The Government of Brazil has requested a Bank loan of US$64 million
equivalent to finance part of the estimated foreign exchange cost of an
ammonia/urea plantl/ for the government-owned fertilizer company, Petrobras
Fertilizantes (FERTILIZANTES)2/ to be built at Laranjeiras, 20 km northwest of
Aracaju, the state capital of Sergipe in the northeast of Brazil (Map IBRD
12276). The project will be located in an area of limited industrialization
and will contribute to the Government's policy of decentralizing Brazil's
industry while building up the economy of the poverty ridden Northeast. The
plant will obtain natural gas which is the most advantageous feedstock for
production of nitrogen fertilizer, from the offshore and onshore gas and oil
fields of the states of Alagoas and Sergipe where some of the natural gas is
flared at present.
1.02      Total financing required for the project is estimated at US$283
million of which about US$102 million or 36% is in direct and indirect foreign
exchange. These financing requirements will be met by equity and a loan from
PETROBRAS (41% and 3% respectively), by a loan from BNDE, the National Dev-
elopment Bank (25%), by a cofinancing arrangement with foreign private lenders
(9%) and the Bank loan (22%). The plant is expected to start commercial
production in early 1981 and to produce an estimated 216,000 metric tons per
year (TPY) of nitrogen (N) of which about 70% would be sold in the form of
urea and the remainder as ammonia.
1.03      The project was appraised in July 1976 with a subsequent mission
in September 1976 by Messrs. N. Petry (chief), G. Evans and K. Loos of the
Industrial Projects Department. In addition, two consultants were employed
for a brief survey of the Northeastern railways and for a study of the gas
reserves in the Northeast3/.

B.   Bank Group Involvement in the Brazilian Fertilizer Sector
1.04      The proposed loan would be the second loan to FERTILIZANTES 1/.
The first of US$50 million was made in May 1976 for the Araucaria ammonia/
urea project 2/. The implementation of the Araucaria project is proceeding
satisfactorily. Procurement of time critical equipment is on schedule al-
though the overall procurement activity is about two months delayed due to
an initially slower pace of basic engineering work and extensive negotia-
tions with the association of local manufacturers resulting in an increase
in the proportion of local equipment from the appraisal estimate of about 50%
to about 65% of total equipment cost. The expected project completion date
still remains the same as estimated at appraisal, but the financing required
has increased by about US$32 million or 14%, all in local currency. Adjust-
ments in the financing plan have been made to cover the additional costs, and
no difficulties are foreseen to provide the funds as required. Even with the
higher capital cost, the economic rate of return remains satisfactory at about
20%.
1.05      Another project (Valefertil) in this sector, though for phosphatic
fertilizers and with different project sponsors, is scheduled for considera-
tion by the Bank's Executive Directors at about the same time as this project.
II. PROJECT SPONSORS
2.01      The project will be owned and operated by FERTILIZANTES, whose
corporate ownership is described in detail in Annex 2.
A.   Petrobras Fertilizantes S.A. (FERTILIZANTES)
2.02      FERTILIZANTES was established in early 1976 as a wholly owned
subsidiary of the national oil company, PETROBRAS, with the objective of
consolidating PETROBRAS' existing and future fertilizer interests. At the
beginning of 1977 FERTILIZANTES took over Brazil's three existing ammonia
based fertilizer plants (Fafer, Ultrafertil, Petrofertil). FERTILIZANTES
also has responsibility for the country's three new ammonia/ urea projects
Araucaria, Norte Fluminense 3/ and Sergipe, the project here under consid-
eration. It has not been decided yet whether these three projects will be
integrated into FERTILIZANTES as separate independent companies or whether
they will be operating divisions of the existing companies. In addition,
FERTILIZANTES has a 20% interest in Fertilizantes Fosfatados, a recently
established public sector company for the exploitation of the phosphate rock
1/   The Bank Group also participated in the Brazilian fertilizer sector
through an IFC investment in Ultrafertil (para 2.06).
2/   Report No. 1050-BR dated April 23, 1976.
3/   The Norte Fluminense project will use natural gas from the gas and oil
fields offshore Campos (Rio de Janeiro). Brazil intends to request the
Inter American Development Bank to finance this plant.

deposit at Patos de Minas (Minas Gerais) and will most likely be involved in
the exploitation of the potash deposit at Carmopolis (Sergipe). PETROBRAS
owns 100% of FERTILIZANTES' shares and will provide technical and management
support to build and operate the Company's facilities. Initial authorized
capitalization is Cr$1,200 (US$93) million of which Cr$10 (US$1) million is
paid in. Once operations become adequately profitable, PETROBRAS plans to
offer FERTILIZANTES' shares for sale, particularly to private sector
fertilizer companies.
2.03      FERTILIZANTES' organization (Annex 2) is in the early stages of
development with staff largely recruited from other PETROBRAS' operations.
The vice-president and three directors (industrial, administrative and fi-
nancial) have been appointed and transferred from PETROBRAS. In mid-1976
the Company had a head-office staff of about 40 to be built up to its full
strength of 170-200 by end of 1977. The Board of Directors are from PETROBRAS
and FERTILIZANTES and the Company's president is also PETROBRAS' president.
B.   Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (PETROBRAS)
2.04      As noted above, FERTILIZANTES' parent company, PETROBRAS, is the
government oil company established in 1953. It owns eight existing refi-
neriesl/ and is responsible for the exploration, production and imports
of petroleum and petroleum derivatives. PETROBRAS has three other wholly-
owned subsidiaries, one for retailing its petroleum products, one for
petroleum exploration outside Brazil and one which consolidates its in-
terests in the chemical industry.
2.05      PETROBRAS' financial statements and the consolidated statements
for PETROBRAS and its subsidiaries are shown in Annex 2. The consolidated
statements are summarized below:

cannot expand and must buy crude from PETROBRAS. There are some
private oil distributors/retailers but they buy refined products

a/   Consolidated financial statements for 1976 are not yet available but 1976
results are expected to be similar to 1975 results.
PETROBRAS' consolidated statements indicate a sound financial situation with
satisfactory earnings and liquidity and a conservative relationship between
debt and equity. PETROBRAS' annual investment program was about US$1.4 billion
equivalent during each of 1974 and 1975 and is expected to continue at about
this level for the next four years. The annual equity requirements for
PETROBRAS' three ammonia/urea projects estimated at less than US$100 million
over a four-year period are thus small (7%) in comparison to its overall
investment program.
C.   Petrobras Quimica S.A. (PETROQUISA) and Present Fertilizer Operations
2.06      PETROBRAS is deeply involved in the production and distribution of
petrochemicals and nitrogen fertilizers, through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Petrobras Quimica S.A. (PETROQUISA), which holds PETROBRAS' interests in the
chemical and petrochemical industries. PETROQUISA has two operating divisions,
seven subsidiaries and participates in 17 joint ventures (Annex 2). It is
primarily for the reason of PETROQUISA's expanding involvement in the chemical
sector that PETROBRAS removed its growing fertilizer interests from PETROQUISA
and consolidated them under FERTILIZANTES. The three existing fertilizer
companies, as described in detail in Annex 2, have had a good production
record with capacity utilization exceeding 80%. The financial performance of



- 5 -
two of these companies (Fafer and Petrofertil) has also been satisfactory,
but Ultrafertil, which was privately owned until PETROQUISA's takeover in
1974 and in which IFC and the original Brazilian shareholder continue to
hold about 15% of the equity, is financially weak with poor profitability
and an inadequate debt service coverage of 0.5 or less for three out of
the four last years. Ultrafertil's weak financial position might seriously
endanger the financial viability of FERTILIZANTES unless concrete steps are
taken to improve Ultrafertil's profitability and financial position. The Bank
has therefore asked and FERTILIZANTES has agreed to prepare and submit to the
Bank not later than August 31, 1977 a detailed report analyzing the reasons
for Ultrafertil's poor financial performance and setting forth specific
measures which have to be taken to improve Ultrafertil's financial position.
2.07      With its existing operations, the PETROBRAS group has the monopoly
of ammonia production for fertilizer use, and it is expected that this will
continue. Participation of the private sector in the production of nitrogenous
fertilizers cannot be expected at this time because of the very high capital
requirements of new, large scale plants particularly when compared to the low
capitalization of the existing private fertilizer industry in Brazil. The
Government took over basic nitrogen production only because of the inability
of the private sector to expand in this area. And, as mentioned, it is the
Government's intention to offer shares of FERTILIZANTES to the private sector
at a later stage.
III. FERTILIZER MARKET AND MARKETING
A.   Agriculture in Brazil
3.01      Brazil's rising agricultural output has resulted mainly from expan-
sions of cultivated area (Annex 3-1). Although it is expected that the area
under cultivation will continue to expand, agricultural growth will have to
depend increasingly on raising the productivity of existing land. The Govern-
ment in its Second Development Plan (1975-1979) has established a goal of a
40% (7% annually) real increase in agricultural output which appears feasible,
with the aim of making Brazil one of the world's foremost producers and ex-
porters of foodstuffs. To achieve this, the Government has allocated substan-
tial resources for bringing new areas into production and for increasing
agricultural productivity through a number of extension programs and through
more use of fertilizer and improved seeds.
3.02      These programs reflect a shift in agricultural policy.  While the
orientation of the Government's investment for developing the agricultural
sector had previously been toward the promotion and establishment of large and
commercially oriented agricultural enterprises, the new policies are emphasiz-
ing increasingly the importance of raising the productivity of small farmers,
especially in the Northeast.
3.03      No sudden eradication of rural poverty, which has been endemic in
some regions of Brazil for decades, is likely to be forthcoming from these
programs. Nevertheless, responsible efforts to improve the productivity of



Northeast agriculture and at the same time to increase industrial activity in
the region have already resulted in a more rapid growth of per capita income
in the Northeast than in Brazil as a whole; this process is expected to
continue.
B.   The Industry and Government Policies in the Fertilizer Sector
3.04      Brazil's fertilizer industry consists of about 50 relatively small
private sector and three larger Government-owned companies with a total pro-
duction capacity in 1976 of 270,000 tons of nitrogen and 690,000 tons of
phosphate (Annex 3-2). The industry, especially the private sector, has con-
centrated on importing, mixing, blending and distributing rather than on
establishing large scale, efficient production facilities. Most companies
compete at the retail level largely with imported materials while only a few
have their own, generally small, production facilities which have to be pro-
tected when world fertilizer prices are low (or restrained when world prices
are high). The low level of domestic production has been due to Brazil's lack
of easily exploitable fertilizer raw materials, the rapidly rising capital
requirements for the manufacture of chemical fertilizers and the absence of
specific Government policies during the 1960s for the development of the
petrochemical sector in general and the fertilizer sector in particular.
3.05      Large amounts of raw, intermediate and finished fertilizer materi-
als, therefore, have been imported. To overcome this dependency on imports,
the Government in 1974 embarked on a program whose objective was to attempt
to assure self-sufficiency in fertilizers by 1980. For that purpose the
Government has published a National Fertilizer Program (NFP), has established
an interministerial Fertilizer Commission charged with ensuring the rational
development of the sector and has developed a program for large, basic pro-
duction facilities of which the Araucaria, Sergipe and Valefertil projects
form part.
3.06      Production costs of local fertilizers have generally been higher
than the cost of imports. To ensure that all domestic production is used,
the Government established a quota system that requires retailers to pur-
chase a given proportion of domestic fertilizer for each unit of imported
fertilizer. The Government has changed this ratio periodically depending
on consumption forecasts and local availability. As the new, large-scale
efficient fertilizer plants enter into production, costs of domestic fertil-
izers are expected to move, in the longer run, in line with long-term inter-
national prices, thereby obviating the need for the import quota system.
3.07      International fertilizer prices were at a very high level in 1973-75
(Annex 3-2, Chart I) causing a decline in the purchasing power of agricultural
products in relation to fertilizers and inducing a leveling off of fertilizer
consumption in Brazil as in many other import dependent countries. Concerned
about the impact of lower fertilizer consumption on its plans for expanding
agricultural production, the Government, in April 1975, introduced a price
subsidy which reduced the price of fertilizers to the farmer by 15 to 30%.



- 7 -
As a result of the rapid decline in international fertilizer prices during
1975 and 1976, the purchasing power of agricultural products in relation to
fertilizers increased again and the subsidy could not any longer be justified.
The Government therefore eliminated the subsidy in late December 1976. While
this action is expected to adversely affect fertilizer demand during the first
months of 1977, the prospects for continued significant growth of fertilizer
demand are good since the relationship between agricultural products (in-
cluding export products) and fertilizer prices is still favorable and the
Government has assured the Bank that it will remain so in the future. The
removal of the subsidy, when it was no longer economically justified, is an
indication of the attention the Government is paying to fertilizer and of the
Government's determination to follow rational policies in this sector.
C.   Historical Consumption and Supply of Fertilizers
3.08      Growth of fertilizer consumption in Brazil has been rapid but
also erratic as shown in the table below (Annex 3-2, Charts II and III):

a/   As estimated by ANDA (National Association for the Promotion
of Fertilizer Use).
Up to 1966 there was little growth reflecting the Government's neglect of the
agricultural and fertilizer sector. Stimulating measures introduced in the
mid-sixties brought six years of very rapid growth with annual increments
averaging 35% through 1972. Over the following three years (1973-75), fer-
tilizer consumption increased only modestly, primarily as a result of the
sharp rise in international prices and the scarcity of fertilizer in the world
market. As shown above, a significant recovery in consumption was anticipated
for 1976 caused by the Government's subsidy and declining international
prices. The relatively high share of phosphate consumption is agionomically
justifiable on account of soil characteristics in Brazil. Although detailed



- 8 -
fertilizer application rates per crop are not yet available, it is estimated
that four crops, namely, sugar, coffee, soybeans and wheat account for 50% to
60% of total consumption.
3.09      On the supply side, domestic fertilizer production has grown at
an average rate of 22% since 1965, but in 1976 supply from national sources
still represented only about 40% of consumption. On a nutrient basis, 37% of
nitrogen, 51% of phosphates and none of the potash comes from the domestic
fertilizer industry. Most of the domestic phosphate production uses imported
phosphate rock since Brazilian rock production accounts for only 10% of the
country's requirements. It is expected, however, that Brazilian phosphate
rock production would increase to 60% by 1982.
D.   Projected Demand and Supply of Fertilizers
3.10      Given the erratic nature of past growth of fertilizer consumption
in Brazil and the lack of detailed and consistent fertilizer statistics,
demand projections carry a considerable amount of uncertainty. Of all the
factors influencing fertilizer consumption, the most important is the
presence or absence of strong Government support policies to promote the
increased use of fertilizers. In view of the Government's interest in
(i) higher agricultural production for which fertilizers are an essential
input; (ii) its willingness to stabilize the ratio of agricultural product
to fertilizer prices; and finally (iii) its declared goal of assuring a
stable supply of fertilizers by sharply increasing the share of domestic
production, it can be said that the Government is providing a favorable
background for significant further growth in fertilizer consumption. The
limiting factors appear to be bottlenecks in transportation, deficiencies
in the extension services, lack of foreign exchange for the import of fer-
tilizer materials and insufficient allocations of agricultural credit.
3.11      The upper limit for future demand can be estimated by normative
analysis from necessary nutrient replacement and by projections of arable
land and cropping patterns. Estimates of this nature result in a potential
demand of about 12 million nutrient tons (NPK) in 1985, compared to the con-
sumption of 2.3 million nutrient tons expected for 1976 (para 3.08). The
average annual growth between 1976 and 1985 would, therefore, be around 23%.
Actual growth rates through 1985 are expected to be much lower, however,
ranging from 10-12% annually, considering the constraints mentioned in the
preceeding paragraph. On this basis, fertilizer demand is projected as
follows:

a/   National Fertilizer Program.
b/   Years in which projections were prepared.
The above table also shows the 1980 consumption targets of the National
Fertilizer Program (NFP); they are in line with the Bank's estimates for
phosphates and potash but considerably higher than our estimates for
nitrogen demand. While higher levels of agricultural productivity imply
an increasingly larger proportion of N relative to P205 application, the
evolving cropping pattern and the opening of new cultivated areas, which
require relatively more P205 than N, are expected to result in only a minor
change in the country's overall NPK ratio. The regional distribution of
fertilizer consumption is assumed to follow the pattern of the last few
years with about 10% of total consumption occurring in the Northeast,
60% in the Center and 30% in the South.
3.12      On the other hand, the pattern of future fertilizer supply is
expected to differ dramatically from the present one; this is the direct
result of the NFP. Although self-sufficiency by 1980 does not appear to
be achievable, it is anticipated that during the early 1980s domestic fer-
tilizer supply will have a share of 60%-70% of total NPK consumption as
compared to about 40% at present. The table below shows that near self-
sufficiency for N and P205 could be reached in the early 1980s, while no
domestic production of K20 is expected until the mid-1980s at the earliest:

a/   Assumes no further capacity addition beyond Araucaria, Sergipe
and Norte Fluminense plants.
The above production estimate takes into account the three new ammonia/urea
projects, Araucaria, Sergipe and Norte Fluminese. A fourth plant to be
built in Rio Grande do Sul in cooperation with the State Government is pre-
sently being evaluated by FERTILIZANTES. From the above, the most appropriate
start of production for this fourth project would seem to be in 1982/83.
An earlier start-up might lead to a temporary excess production of nitrogen.
To keep abreast of the investment plans in the fertilizer sector and to ensure
that new plants are built in accordance with as realistic demand projections
as possible, assurances have been obtained that the Government will exchange
views with the Bank from time to time regarding the expansion and development
of the fertilizer sector, including investment plans and import and pricing
policies.
E.   Fertilizer Marketing and Distribution
3.13      About 90% of total fertilizer distribution is effected through
blenders which are either owned by fertilizer manufacturers (25% of total),
independent companies (65%) or cooperatives (10%). The Government intends
private firms to continue handling the marketing and distribution functions
in the sector. However, the rapid expansion of consumption expected in
the next few years, and changing pattern of supply, might create a severe
strain on the existing fertilizer marketing and distribution network.



- 11 -
To analyze potential bottlenecks, and their effect on future fertilizer
consumption, the Government agreed, in connection with the Bank's loan
for the Araucaria project, to undertake a marketing and distribution study
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. The study began in
October 1976, and its results are expected to be available by late 1977.
F.   The Market and Marketing for Sergipe's Fertilizer Production
3.14      The Sergipe plant will be located just south of the main ferti-
lizer consumption center of the Northeast and will cater for that region's
nitrogen requirements (Annex 3-3). Growth of fertilizer consumption in this
region has averaged about 22% per year over the last decade, compared to rates
of 34% and 20% for the South and Center, respectively. Because of the poor
soils and the arid and semi-arid climate of the Northeast, fertilizer consump-
tion is primarily restricted to those areas where rainfalls are high or
where irrigation schemes provide the required water for efficient use of
fertilizers. This is the case in the narrow humid belt along the coast (the
Zona de Mata) and in a more limited way in the transition zone (the Agreste)
between the humid coast and the arid interior (Map IBRD 12412).
3.15      Up to the late 1960s, the Northeast used fertilizer nearly exclu-
sively for sugarcane, the predominant crop in the coastal belt. A detailed
farm survey, however, which was done by a joint effort of SUDENE and the Bank
in 1973, revealed that use of fertilizers has become much more diversified.
According to the survey, fertilizer was used in 1973 as follows: 50% for
sugarcane, 15% for cacao, 15% for beans, 10% for manioc and 10% for other
crops. Unfortunately, no time series is available that would indicate how
fertilizer applications have changed over time for each crop.
3.16      Also in 1973, the Government contracted ANDA for a three-year
program to determine the bottlenecks preventing increased use of fertilizer
and to conduct a large number of tests of fertilizer use in the various
states and for all the major crops cultivated in the Northeast. The results
of this program, which was actively supported by FAO and which is likely
to be continued, are now available and are very encouraging; they clearly
show that more fertilizer can significantly increase agricultural yields
as well as gross revenues and net profits to the farmer at benefit cost
ratios which indicate no undue increase in the risk to him.
3.17      Against this background, the prospects for continued growth of
fertilizer consumption in the Northeast are good. However, there are no
detailed studies of the underlying reasons for the past and future
fertilizer demand in the Northeast so that projections have to be based
on assumed growth rates. A normative analysis, similar to the one for
the whole of Brazil (para 3.11), indicates a potential fertilizer demand
of about 1 million nutrient tons by 1985. This would imply an average
annual growth rate of about 19% for the period 1977-1985, against one of
22% for the last ten years. Because of the same constraints mentioned for
the whole of Brazil (para 3.10) it is more likely that the actual growth
rate will be lower and 12% per year is assumed here. The financial and
economic risks of the project associated with an even lower than assumed



- 12 -
growth rate of fertilizer demand are discussed further below (paras. 6.10
and 7.07).
3.18      On the supply side, although reserves of natural gas, the ideal
raw material for production of nitrogen, are limited in Brazil, they are
concentrated in the Northeast and therefore this region is particularly well
suited for the production of ammonia and urea. With an existing plant
at Camacari in the State of Bahia which is presently being expanded and the
Sergipe project, the Northeast will produce considerably more nitrogen than
required by this region as shown below:

Until 1981, the region's demand for nitrogen will be satisfied by the
increasing production from the Camacari plant which will provide an
important stimulus to fertilizer consumption in the Northeast. From 1981
onward, the Sergipe plant, because of its proximity to the market, will
supply the Northeast with nitrogen while all of the output of the Camacari
plant, located near the port of Aratu and some output of the Sergipe plant
will have to be shipped to other regions in Brazil (primarily the Center),
where it will substitute for imports. By 1986 demand in the Northeast is
expected to exceed the production from the project, and in the following
years, the Camacari plant will again increasingly supply the Northeastern
market.
3.19      Of the total nitrogen consumption in the Northeast, it is
estimated that in 1976, 65% was consumed in the form of urea and 35% as
ammonium-sulfate. The completion of the Camacari expansion, the Sergipe
project and the planned MAP/DAP plants will bring the share of urea
consumption to about 70% with the remaining N requirements being satisfied
by MAP, DAP and ammonium sulfate, this is not a significant change from the
current compositon of N consumption. Urea has been accepted in the market
as an efficient fertilizer, and from tests done by the extension services,
the universities and the fertilizer companies, it can be concluded that
urea is a fully suitable fertilizer.



- 13 -
3.20      The project's urea output will be sold to bulkblenders and mixers
who have plants close to the ports of Recife and Maceio. Transportation of
urea to Recife and Maceio is planned to be mostly by railway with most of it
in bags. However, FERTILIZANTES intends to increase bulk shipments to large
customers for which bulk unloading facilities would be economic. Exploita-
tion of the potash deposit at Carmopolis, about 30 km to the northwest of
the project site and expected to start by the mid-1980s, will make the area
attractive for the location of new mixing and blending installations.
3.21      Of the project's saleable ammonia output of 80,000 TPY of ammonia,
48,000 TPY are expected to be consumed by ammonium phosphate plants planned
for Recife and Maceio, and the remaining 32,000 TPY would be shipped to other
regions in Brazil via the new chemical port of Aratu, which will include
facilities for the storage and handling of ammonia and bulk fertilizer
materials. PETROBRAS will be responsible for the coastal shipping of
ammonia and will either buy or charter boats for that purpose. The ports
of Santos (Center) and Rio Grande (South) to which ammonia can be shipped
have adequate special storage and handling facilities for ammonia.
3.22      As a result of the Camacari expansion and this project, the rail-
way transportation requirements in the Northeast will significantly increase.
While the capacity of the lines is sufficient to handle the expected traffic
up to about 1995, the operations of the Northeastern railways (they are part
of the Federal Railway Authority (RFFSA) to which the Bank has made two loans)
will have to be improved as described in Annex 3-4. The recommendations made
by the Bank to this end have been agreed to in principle by RFFSA and their
execution will be supervised by the Bank as part of its follow up of the
existing loans to RFFSA. Special rail cars for the transport of liquid
ammonia and bulk urea will be purchased by FERTILIZANTES as part of the
project. Box cars for bagged urea, tank cars for gas and Bunker C oil and
locomotives will be supplied by RFFSA.
3.23      The projected continued growth in fertilizer demand will require
significant additional investments in the marketing and distribution system
in the Northeast. In the past, the private sector has made these invest-
ments as required and as long as the Government support policies keep the
marketing and distribution business profitable, the required future invest-
ments are expected to be forthcoming. For FERTILIZANTES it is most important
to keep in close contact with the developments in the fertilizer sector in
the Northeast and all of Brazil. For that purpose FERTILIZANTES has set
up its own market analysis and marketing group. The main tasks of this group
are (i) to analyze the market in order to gain an understanding of the
forces affecting demand (including Government policies); (ii) to make regional
and overall fertilizer demand projections; and (iii) to closely monitor the
development of the marketing and distribution system which is largely in the
hands of the private sector.

IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope
4.01      The project involves the construction of a 907 TPD (1,000 short
tons per day) ammonia plant and an 1,100 TPD urea plant on a grass roots
100 hectare site at Laranjeiras, about 20 km northwest of Aracaju in the
state of Sergipe. The site has good road and rail connections as it is
served by the existing road from Aracaju and by the Salvador-Recife railway
passing within about 5 km (Annex 4-1). The project will include all neces-
sary production ancillaries, and both the ammonia and urea units will be
single train of standard size capacities employing modern commercially
proven technologies to ensure reliable operation. On the basis of 330
stream days per year and an assumed maximum capacity utilization of 90%
projected for the third year of operations (1983) and thereafter, the plant
will produce about 270,000 TPY ammonia and 327,000 TPY urea. Of the ammonia
production 190,000 TPY will be used by the project as intermediate in the
production of urea with the balance of about 80,000 TPY being sold directly
(para 3.21). The project includes specialized railcars for the transport of
ammonia and urea and will contain provision for bagging the entire urea
output, but it is anticipated that a significant proportion will be shipped in
bulk. A detailed description of the project is given in Annex 4-2.
B.   Raw Materials and Utilities
4.02      Principal raw materials to be consumed (Annex 4-3) by the project
at full capaciSy will be natural gas and vacuum gas oil at an annual rate of
215 million NM and 109,000 tons, respectively. Additionally, about 50,000 TPY
Bunker C fuel oil will be required for steam generation. Natural gas will be
supplied by PETROBRAS from its own onshore and offshore deposits in the states
of Sergipe and Alagoas. PETROBR.S has determined the to5al reserves in these
areas currently as 19 billion NM including 10 billion NM  p5oven, out of which
the project will be allocated, a quantity of 3.1 billion NM sufficient for
about 15 years operation at full capacity. Details of these reserves and
their projected consumption are given in Annex 4-4 and specifications for the
gas, vacuum gas oil and Bunker C fuel oil in Annex 4-5. The gas is especially
suitable for ammonia production containing about 97% hydrocarbons and only a
very small quantity of sulfur.
4.03      PETROBRAS currently operates a gas transmission pipeline supplying
the state of Bahia with gas from its gas compression and distribution center
9 km south of Aracaju. PETROBRAS will construct a new gas liquid separation
plant adjacent to this center and a new dry gas supply pipeline to the proj-
ect site. Additionally, PETROBRAS is constructing a gas gathering and con-
servation scheme in the states of Sergipe and Alagoas to reduce gas losses
and boost supplies to the Aracaju terminal. These facilities are not part
of the project but are essential for its operation and are planned for com-
pletion well in advance of completiol of the project. PETROBRAS has agreed to
dedicate a minimum of 3.1 billion NM of gas from its offshore and onshore



- 15 -
gas reserves in the states of Alagoas and Sergipe to the exclusive use of the
project and to build and maintain any facilities (including the construction
of pipelines and compressor stations) that are required to provide the project
with adequate supplies of gas.
4.04      Vacuum gas and Bunker C fuel oil requirements will be met from
PETROBRAS' Mataripe refinery (near Salvador, Bahia) and will be shipped in
rail tank cars via the existing railway service over some 450 km to a storage
terminal to be constructed by PETROBRAS adjacent to the project site (Annex
3-4). To supply the project with water and electricity, a water pipeline and
additional electrical transmission lines will be built, as described in Annex
4-2. The electrical supply facilities will be constructed by the local
authorities independently of the project, but approximately 17% of the cost
of the water pipeline will be financed by FERTILIZANTES as part of the
project. To ensure that these raw materials and facilities will be available
to the project as required, satisfactory arrangements for the supply of
natural gas, vacuum gas oil and Bunker C fuel oil and for construction of the
water and electricity supply facilities involving firm obligations from
suppliers are conditions of loan effectiveness.
C.   Project Administration and Implementation
4.05      PETROBRAS' fertilizer project implementation unit (COFEN) I/ sup-
ported by PETROBRAS' engineering department will supervise project execution
on behalf of FERTILIZANTES, coordinate the work of the foreign and local
contractors, and contract directly with local firms (yet to be selected) for
civil works and erection. Procurement of all but critical items will be
undertaken by FERTILIZANTES' own procurement department. PETROBRAS has
already signed contracts with Pullman Kellogg (USA) for provision of process
license, basic engineering design, procurement assistance, and technical
advisory services relating to the ammonia unit and general site facilities,
and with the Toyo Engineering Company (Japan) for provision of similar services
and process license relating to the urea unit. Selection of Kellogg and Toyo
as the foreign engineering contractors was based on the results of competitive
offers received by PETROBRAS in 1972 for the Petrofertil ammonia/urea project.
On the basis of that result, an assessment of these companies' charges
for the Sergipe project and the benefits to be gained from standardization
of technology and better prospects for technology transfer, FERTILIZANTES'
appointment of Kellogg and Toyo for the Sergipe project is acceptable.
4.06      Detailed engineering of the ammonia unit and general plant
facilities will be undertaken by a Brazilian firm, Promon Engenharia S.A.
(PROMON), acting as a nominated subcontractor and under the supervision of
Kellogg. Another local engineering firm, Montreal Engenharia S.A. (MONTREAL),
will undertake detailed engineering of the urea unit as nominated subcon-
1/   Construcao de Fertilizantes Nitrogenados (Construction of Nitrogen
Fertilizer Facilities).



- 16 -
tractor and under the supervision of Toyo 1/. Selection of these companies
followed a comparison of unit rates charged by local engineering firms adjudged
by PETROBRAS to have the necessary qualifications and available capacity.
Given the wide experience of PETROBRAS and the availability of technical ad-
visory services from Kellogg and Toyo through the detailed engineering, pro-
curement, construction, and start-up periods, this arrangement is considered
satisfactory. Aside from signing contracts with the engineering firms,
FERTILIZANTES has already acquired the site for the project and commenced site
preparation work, but has not yet entered into any commitments for the supply
of equipment and materials. The project schedule shown in Annex 4-6 provides
for commencement of commercial operations by January 1, 1981. With four years
to commercial production, the implementation schedule is somewhat longer than
what has been estimated for similar Bank-financed fertilizer projects. Taking
into account, however, the low level of industrialization in the Northeast,
the somewhat complicated coordination procedures between FERTILIZANTES and
PETROBRAS and the engineering companies, and the actual implementation schedule
of projects now being constructed, the above estimate appears realistic.
D.   Ecology
4.07      The Sergipe plant will include facilities for removal of contaminants
from the condensates of the ammonia unit and urea evaporator before discharge,
and for collection and removal of oil from waste waters (Annex 4-2). Addition-
ally, cooling tower blow down will be treated for removal of chromates and
demineralization plant waste neutralized. A sewerage treatment plant will be
provided for sanitary waste. The overall effluent treatment system inclusive
of these facilities will be based on existing Brazilian standards which have
been adjudged as satisfactory.
E.   Employment and Training
4.08      Thie project will provide direct employment for about 384 people,
most of whom will be professional, skilled or semi-skilled (Annex 4-2). It
is expected that most of the staff will be recruited from the Aracaju area
or transferred from PETROBRAS refinery or FERTILIZANTES's existing fertilizer
plants. Except for an initial period during commissioning when expatriate
supervisors will be present, the project will be staffed entirely by Brazilian
personnel. It will be the responsibility of FERTILIZANTES to acquire the
necessary personnel and have them trained to ensure smooth start-up and
operation of the project. FERTILIZANTES will be able to benefit from the
excellent facilities that PETROBRAS has for the purpose of training the large
number of skilled staff required for its major refinery and petrochemical
expansion programs. Additionally, the ammonia/urea complex of Petrofertil
will be used for "in-plant" training, and the project's process licensors
1/   The employment of local engineering firms and the concomitant transfer
of technology is an important contribution to the development of
Brazil's engineering industry which will facilitate implementation
of future projects.



- 17 -
and contractors will provide special training in the process technology
involved and some practical training in similar operational ammonia and
urea units for selected personnel. FERTILIZANTES has agreed to provide the
Bank not later than March 31, 1978, with a detailed plan, acceptable to the
Bank, for recruitment, training and staffing of the project.
V.  CAPITAL COST, FINANCING PLAN, PROCUREMENT AND ALLOCATION OF BANK LOAN
A.   Capital Cost
5.01      The total financing required for the project is estimated at
US$283.4 million equivalent (Cr$3,500 million) of which US$101.9 million
(Cr$1,258 million) is in foreign exchange. The estimate is summarized
in the following table and shown in more detail in Annex 5-1 together with
the assumptions made:

- 18 -
5.02      The above costs are based on estimates prepared by the foreign
contractors and PETROBRAS' engineering department in June 1976 and updated
in January 1977, and take into account prices for equipment and materials
presently being procured by PETROBRAS on other similar projects. In compar-
ison with capital costs estimates for similar fertilizer projects financed
by the Bank, the above estimate appears somewhat high; for this a number of
reasons exist: First, the project includes relatively large amounts for
infrastructure for water supply and the railway extension and special rail-
cars totalling US$19 million equivalent. Second, charges for price escala-
tion and interest during construction are high because of the somewhat longer
implementation period (para 4.06). Third, Brazilian costs for equipment and
services are high when expressed in US dollars. This can at least partially
be explained by the use of the official rate of exchange which is estimated
to overvalue the Cruzeiro by about 25%. And fourth, as a result of the
Government's and PETROBRAS' policy to support and develop Brazilian industry,
60% of the equipment and materials required by the project are to be procured
locally. This, because of the higher Brazilian costs, is estimated to in-
crease the cost of equipment and materials by about 11% and the total financ-
ing requirements at the official exchange rate by a maximum of 5%.
5.03      All imported equipment and materials for the project will be exempt
from import duty. The cost of foreign engineering services and licenses
included are the estimated values of the contracts which were signed in
November 1976. The estimated cost per man-month (exclusive of travel and
subsistence allowance) of local and foreign engineering services range from
US$3,000 to 4,000 and US$7,000 to 8,000 respectively. Physical contingencies
equivalent to about 9% of the base cost estimate have been added. Price
escalation for equipment 1/ is calculated on the basis of projected price
increases of 8% per year in 1977 and thereafter in major equipment supplying
countries because of worldwide inflation. On civil works, escalation rates of
12% per year in 1977 and thereafter have been assumed based on the estimate,
as in the recent past, that the cost of civil works in Brazil will rise faster
than the general price level. The above cost estimates, including physical
and price contingencies, are considered adequate.
5.04      Initial working capital requirements for the project (excluding
spare parts and initial supplies of chemicals which are already included
elsewhere in the above cost estimate) are detailed in Annex 5-2 and estimated
at US$15.0 million equivalent. Interest during construction is estimated
at US$25.3 million based on the disbursement as shown in the debt service
schedule (Annex 6-3, Page 2) and on interest rates of 10% and 4% for foreign
and local loans 2/, respectively.
1/   The international price inflation rate is also used for estimating
price escalation of local purchases (expressed in US dollars) on
the assumption that differences in the domestic and international
inflation rates will be accounted for by continuing adjustments
in the exchange rate as is the Government's policy.
2/   These interest rates are not directly comparable since interest on
foreign loans is expressed in current terms while the interest
on local loans is given in real terms, i.e., with the interest and
principal subject to regular adjustments in line with domestic
inflation.

B.   Financing Plan
5.05       The financing plan for the project will be as follows:
Proposed Financing Plan
(in Cr$ Million)         (in US$ Million)         %
Equity (PETROBRAS)           1,435                      116.1            41
Debt
World Bank                790                       64.0             22
Cofinancing               310                       25.0              9
Local Loan  BNDE          875                       71.0             25
PETROBRAS    90                         7.3             3
Total Debt      2,065                      167.3             59
Total Financing              3,500                     283.4            100
The project will be financed with about 41% equity and 59% debt.  PETROBRAS
will provide the entire equity funds and a loan of about US$7.3 million equiva-
lent for local currency expenditures. The latter could also be provided in
the form of equity or through other local or foreign loans to be determined
jointly by PETROBRAS and FERTILIZANTES. An analysis of PETROBRAS' cash flow
projections indicates that PETROBRAS will be able to provide these funds as
well as cost overrun financing should this be necessary. The remainder of the
local currency financing will come from the National Development Bank (BENDE)
which has in principle agreed to provide these funds; nevertheless, BNDE is
presently undertaking a final evaluation of the project and loan approval is
expected by mid-1977. Repayment terms for the BNDE loan are expected to be
about the same as those of the Bank, i.e. 15 years including four years of
grace.  While the loan will be expressed in constant terms with an interest of
4% per year, loan disbursements and debt service payments will be in current
terms using a monetary correction factor tied to the domestic inflation
rate.
5.06       The foreign exchange financing will come from the proposed Bank
loan and from cofinancing arrangements with foreign private investors.
Although untied as to purpose, the cofinancing is intended primarily to
cover the foreign component of interest during construction (US$17.6 million).
At this time, FERTILIZANTES has not decided whether the cofinancing will come
from a foreign commercial bank or through a private placement of its debt
obligations with institutional investors in the US. This will be determined
by market conditions prevailing at the time FERTILIZANTES will seek such an
arrangement. The terms for this type of financing will probably be seven-nine
years maturity including three years of grace with an interest rate of about
10% per yearl/. FERTILIZANTES agreed that it will make its best efforts to
obtain about US$25 million in untied foreign exchange through a cofinancing
arrangement not later than six months after Bank approval of the proposed
loan.
1/   The financial projections in this report assume maturity of eight
years including a grace period of three years and annual interest
of 10%.



- 20 -
5.07      A Bank loan of US$64 million is proposed for 15 years including
four years of grace at the standard Bank rate (currently 8.5% annual
interest) plus a guarantee fee to the Government to bring total annual
interest to FERTILIZANTES to 10%. The Bank loan will be made directly to
FERTILIZANTES which will also carry the foreign exchange risk.
5.08      As in the Araucaria project, a number of assurances have been
obtained from PETROBRAS and the Government regarding the financing plan of the
project; these are as follows. Should any shortfall occur in the financing
plan or should the project require additional funds, PETROBRAS will assure the
provision of all necessary funds in the form of equity and/or loans to com-
plete 1/ the project promptly in such a way that its (the project's) debt/
equity ratio will not exceed 60/40 and its current ratio be at least 1.2.
PETROBRAS also agreed to assist FERTILIZANTES in its efforts of obtaining
financing through the proposed cofinancing arrangements and from BNDE. In
the event that some loan repayments will be due before project completion,
PETROBRAS agreed to refinance or arrange financing for such repayments. In
addition, the Government agreed to take all necessary steps to assure that all
funds, including foreign exchange are provided as required to complete the
project without delay and in a form satisfactory to the Bank and that all
approvals for implementation of the project, and all necessary imports are
timely provided.
C.   Procurement
5.09      All procurement for the project will be undertaken by FERTILI-
ZANTES's own purchasing department with the exception of some technically
specialized items which will be procured by the foreign engineering contrac-
tors (Kellogg and Toyo). Prequalification of suppliers to participate in ICB
following placement of international notices will be undertaken by PETROBRAS'
engineering department utilizing, as appropriate, advisory services from
Kellogg and Toyo; the list of prequalified firms will be subject to the Bank's
approval. Except for a reserve list of equipment for local manufacture which
has been prepared by FERTILIZANTES and will be reviewed by the Ministry of
Finance in consultation with the domestic manufacturers' association and which
will also be subject to Bank approval (estimated at US$73 million equivalent
ex-factory), all remaining equipment and materials for the project (estimated
at US$55 million equivalent c.i.f.) will be purchased through ICB (US$30
million equivalent) and through international shopping (US$25 million equiva-
lent) in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines. Of the equipment
and materials so procured, it is estimated that Brazilian suppliers will be
able to compete with offshore suppliers for items totalling about US$20
million of which Brazilian suppliers are expected to win equipment and mate-
rials totalling US$12 million equivalent. For the purpose of bid comparison,
Brazilian suppliers participating in ICB will be granted a preference of 15%.
It is planned to appoint one contractor for all major civil works and one for
all plant erection after competitive bidding amongst local firms.
1/   The project is considered complete when the plant has operated during
a period of 60 consecutive days at 80% of its capacity.

D.   Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Funds
5.10      The proceeds of the Bank loan would be used to finance 100% of for-
eign expenditures or 100% of the ex-factory price for products manufactured
in Brazil for (i) equipment and materials procured through ICB (US$30.0
million); (ii) imported critical and highly specialized items with restricted
bidders lists approved by the Bank (US$13 million); (iii) imported items
and packages costing less than US$100,000 each procured through international
shopping (US$12 million); and (iv) foreign engineering and advisory services
(US$9 million). It is anticipated that prior to loan signature advance
contracting will amount to US$9 million for foreign engineering services
with consequent retroactive Bank financing of such expenditures not exceeding
US$1.5 million. No advance contracting and retroactive financing for equip-
ment and materials will be necessary. The anticipated Bank loan disbursement
and allocation schedules are shown in Annex 5-3 and Annex 5-4.  Any surplus
funds remaining in the loan account after completion of the project will be
cancelled.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.  General
6.01      The medium and long-term financial outlook for FERTILIZANTES is dif-
ficult to assess accurately at this time since the details of the takeover of
the existing companies are presently being worked out and because it is not
yet clear in which manner the presently planned future undertakings will be
integrated under FERTILIZANTES. For the next 3 - 4 years, the Company's
strength will be dependent on the three existing operations (Fafer, Ultra-
fertil, Petrofertil) of which only Ultrafertil will need to be significantly
strengthened (para. 2.06), the other two being financially sound. From 1980
onwards, however, the financial position of FERTILIZANTES will be increasingly
determined by the new large-scale ammonia/ urea plants to be built in Araucaria,
Sergipe and Norte Fluminense and the Company's participation in the exploita-
tion of the phosphate and potash deposits at Patos de Minas and Carmopolis
respectively. Because of its newness, FERTILIZANTES has so far not prepared
any long-term financial projections for all its operations combined. However,
FERTILIZANTES should soon be sufficiently well established to prepare a 5-year
financial forecast and has agreed to prepare such projections by July 1, 1977
and update them annually and make them available to the Bank as part of the
Company's reporting to the Bank. In the absence of such projections at this
time the financial analysis is carried out here by treating the project as an
independent financial entity and assessing its strength.
6.02      All money values in the financial projections are expressed in
current US dollars using an assumed annual inflation rate of 8% until 1979 and
7% thereafter up to 1985. Using US dollars instead of Brazilian Cruzeiros
has the advantage that no estimate of Brazilian future inflation is required.
This approach assumes that the difference between domestic and international
inflation is taken care of by appropriate exchange rate adjustments which has
generally been the case in the past. The assumptions made in the financial
analysis of the project are given in detail in Annex 6-1 and summarized
below.



- 22 -
B.   Production, Sales Prices and Operating Costs
6.03      It is assumed that the project will start commercial production
in January 1981 and that capacity utilization will increase from 70% during
the first year of operations to 90% during the third year (1983) and there-
after. At 90% capacity utilization the project would produce for sale
327,000 TPY of urea and 80,000 TPY of ammonia. It is estimated that about
70% of the urea output would be sold in bags at an estimated bag and bagging
cost of US$11 per ton urea.
6.04      So far, FERTILIZANTES has not developed a detailed pricing policy
for its fertilizer products. However, it is committed to two main objec-
tives. First, since FERTILIZANTES intends to sell shares to the private
sector, prices have to be high enough to generate sufficient profits and
dividends to make the Company's shares attractive to private investors.
Second, FERTILIZANTES has a mandate from the Government to produce and sell
fertilizer materials at stable prices comparable to those prevailing over
time in the international market. The Bank's long-term international price
forecast indicates, in 1976 terms, a range between US$165 and 171 per ton
urea (f.o.b., bagged) from which an ex-factory price for the Sergipe project
of about US$205 per ton urea (bulk) destined for the Northeast market, can
be determined satisfying both considerations mentioned above. For the urea
which will be shipped to other regions, primarily the Center, a lower ex-
factory price of US$175 per ton is assumed, reflecting the additional trans-
port costs between the plant and the Center. These prices compare to Petro-
fertil's mid-1976 ex-factory price for urea of about US$180 per ton and a
maximum Government controlled retail price of US$280 per ton. On average,
ammonia is assumed to have a 1:1 price relationship to urea (bulk), which
reflects the production cost relationship of N in ammonia to N in urea.
These pricing principles have been discussed and agreed upon with the Govern-
ment and FERTILIZANTES.
6.05      The prices of the principal raw materials for the plant (natural
gas, vacuum gas and Bunker C oil) are all price controlled by the Government.
On July 1, 1976 the Government increased the prices for these materials
by about 40% but leaving them still clearly below world market levels. The
revised prices are: US$0.84 per MSCF natural gas, US$58.4 per ton vacuum
gas oil and US$49.2 per ton Bunker C oil. It is assumed that, except for
adjustments for domestic inflation, the above prices will prevail during
the planning period. The sensitivity analysis on the financial rate of re-
turn (para 6.10) indicates how the project would be affected if economic raw
material prices were to be charged instead of the financial ones.
C.   Production Costs and Financial Forecasts
6.06      Under the price assumptions made above and at a capacity utili-
zation of 90%, the production cost (excluding financial charges) per ton
of ammonia and urea will be US$105 and US$115 respectively in constant
1976 terms (Annex 6-2). Feedstock and fuel, depreciation and others
(including labor) each account for about one-third of the estimated total
annual operating costs.

6.07      The financial projections as shown in Annex 6-3 and as summarized
below indicate a sound financial situation for the project entity:

a/   Total assets minus cash surplus
6.08      The sales value is expected to increase from US$87 million in
1981 to US$136 million in 1983 when the target capacity utilization (i.e.
90%) is expected to be reached for the first full year. The operating
ratio (operating profit as % of sales) will improve from 35 to 45% over
the same period. The project's profitability is demonstrated by a
steady growth of profit after taxes from US$12 million in 1981 to US$35
in 1983 and profitability will further increase thereafter with declining
interest payments. By 1983, the profit and cash breakeven capacity utili-
zation is about 52 and 43% respectively.
6.09      The project's cash generating ability together with the assumed
loan terms is expected to maintain a debt service ratio of 2.0 or better
during the forecast period. In spite of heavy debt service payments which
will reach some US$30 million (about 27% of sales value) in 1982 the enter-
prise can still accumulate sufficient funds for reinvestments. After the
first year of operation, the project will be able to make an annual contri-
bution to FERTILIZANTES's dividend payments at a rate of 10% of its equity.
It is projected that the project will have no difficulty of maintaining
a current ratio of 1.2 or better from the first year of operations. The
debt/equity ratio is 48/52 at the end of 1981; it also will steadily improve
and benefit from the revaluation of equity over the subsequent years.
D.   Financial Rate of Return
6.10      The financial rates of return of the project are 15% after and 19%
before taxes; these are satisfactory. Sensitivity tests are presented in



- 24 -
Annex 6-4 and summarized in the table below indicating the relative effect on
the above returns resulting from various + changes in costs or benefit streams:
Sergipe - Sensitivity Tests
+ Relative Change in
Change in:                              Financial Rate of Return
(before tax)
Ammonia/urea prices (+ 10%)                      3.0
Capital Costs (+ 10%)                            1.9
Operating Costs (+ 10%)                          1.1
Operating Costs (Economic Instead
of Financial Raw Material Prices)              2.3
Capacity Utilization (+ 10%)                     2.3
Delay in Completion (1/2 year)                   1.4
Capital Costs & Delay in Completion              3.3
(+ 10%, 1/2 year)
Similar to other fertilizer projects, the return is most sensitive to a change
in sales prices and least sensitive to changing operating costs. As the
sensitivity tests in Annex 6-4 indicate, even under the unlikely adverse
condition of a 20% decrease in the assumed sales prices the project's rate
of return before taxes of 12% would still remain acceptable. If prices for
raw materials were to increase to economic or world market levels, the return
would drop to 16%. In the event that the annual growth rate of fertilizer
demand in the Northeast would, from 1980 onwards, be only half of the pro-
jected 12%, thus requiring larger quantities of the plant's output to be
shipped to other regions, the project's before tax return would only decrease
by about 1% to 18%.
E.   Major Risks
6.11      It is unlikely that the project will face major management problems
since PETROBRAS has previous experience in executing similar projects such as
the ammonia/urea plant at Camacari. Neither does it appear likely that major
engineering and technological risks will arise as the engineering contractors
are internationally recognized and are using proven technology and processes.
The same foreign contractors are being used in the presently implemented ex-
pansion of the Camacari plant. The employment of less experienced local
engineering firms, more complicated coordination and procurement arrangements
than in PETROBRAS' most other projects, are taken into account by giving a
6-month longer period for project execution than in similar cases.
6.12      Financial risks exist because the prices for raw materials, the
retail prices of fertilizers and the agricultural product prices are all
subject to Government regulations and thus outside FERTILIZANTES' control.
Since demand for the Company's products and the profitability of FERTILIZANTES



- 25 -
are governed by these prices, the Government has agreed that it will not take
any pricing measures which would prevent the Company from covering its costs,
servicing its debts and earning a reasonable return on its investment under
conditions of efficient operations.
6.13      The demand for the project's ammonia and urea output is a derived
demand originating at the farm level with the bulkblenders and mixers being
the intermediary between the farmer and FERTILIZANTES. For the marketing of
its products, the Company, therefore, has to rely on the bulkblending and mix-
ing companies without being able to directly influence demand. As mentioned,
FERTILIZANTES also has to rely on these companies to meet the investment
requirements of the distribution system stemming from a fast growing demand
in fertilizers in the Northeast. This constitutes a marketing risk. It will
be reduced by FERTILIZANTES' own market analysis and marketing group (para
3.23) and by the actions taken on the recommendations of the Fertilizer Market
and Marketing Study (para 3.13) which will indicate the measures that have to
be taken by the Government and the other entities involved in the sector.
F.   Financial Covenants
6.14      Following project completion, FERTILIZANTES will be required to
follow prudent financial practices and has agreed to observe, both as a
Company and for the project, the following financial covenants, which are
essentially the same as agreed to for the Araucaria project:
i)   maintain a debt/equity ratio of 60/40 or better;
ii)   maintain a current ratio of at least 1.2:1.0;
iii)   not incur any long-term debt if its debt service coverage
will fall below 1.5;
and FERTILIZANTES will:
iv)   limit its dividend distribution (except for dividends on
preferred shares), or its financial commitment to any of its
subsidiaries, or prepayment of any debt if such action
would cause its current ratio to fall below 1.5;
v)   operate the project as a separate profit center with its
own income, cash flow and balance sheet accounts for
control purposes; and
vi)   continue to have its accounts audited by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank.

VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   General
7.01      In economic terms, the project substitutes temporarily for imports
into other regions, primarily the Center as dicussed in para 3.18. For the
valuation of the economic benefits, this means that the output of the project
has to be valued at c.i.f. prices, since port handling charges and inland
transportation to the consumption centers would take place in any case. In
addition, the transport patterns with and without the project and their
associated costs have been analyzed to determine the incremental transport
costs and benefits accruing to the economy as a result of the project.
7.02      For the economic analysis of the project, costs and benefits are
divided into tradeable and non-tradeable items and are valued at their re-
spective world market and domestic prices. Most significant in the economic
analysis is the valuation of the raw material and fertilizer prices. The
economic rate of return has been calculated using a shadow rate of exchange
25% higher than the official rate to reflect foreign trade distortions caused
by import tariffs, export taxes and subsidies, as well as other forms of
import restrictions or export incentives. The costs and benefits during the
project's operating life are expressed in constant 1976 US dollars. The
assumptions for the economic analysis of this project are detailed in Annex
7-1.
7.03      After the increases in 1973/74, international fertilizer prices
started to fall in 1975 and reached their low point during the first half
of 1976. Bagged urea has been selling at about US$120 per ton f.o.b. during
the latter half of 1976 and it is expected that real price increases will
bring the price level in constant 1976 terms to about US$165 and US$171 per
ton in 1979/1985 respectively 1/. Using the price forecast for 1985 as an
average f.o.b. price during the project's operating life, a c.i.f. price of
US$185 per ton bulk urea is derived after taking into account ocean freight
(US$25 per ton) and bagging charges (US$11 per ton). For ammonia, the
same price of US$185 per ton is used assuming - as in the financial
analysis - an ammonia/urea price relationship of 1:1.
B.   Prices of Raw Materials and Economic Product Costs
7.04      The limited natural gas resources of the Northeast make it
necessary to restrict the use of gas to purposes where it can be used as
a feedstock for the petro-chemical industries. Other consumers, who would
have used the gas for heating purposes, will have to use other fuels,
mainly heavy fuel oil, which is readily available. Therefore, the oppor-
tunity cost of gas has been established on a calorific equivalent basis with
heavy fuel oil. Assuming an f.o.b. crude oil price of about US$11.5 per
barrel and an f.o.b. heavy fuel oil price of about US$63 per ton, the oppor-
I/   Price Prospects for Major Primary Commodities, June 1976, WB Rep. No.
814/76.



- 27 -
tunity cost of the gas consumed by the project is estimated at US$1.48 per
MCSF. As fuel, the project requires Bunker C and vacuum gas oil, both
traded commodities, with estimated long-term economic f.o.b. prices of US$65
and US$80 per ton respectively. The economic product costs deducted
from these price assumptions for raw materials are shown in Annex 6-2.
C.   Transportation
7.05      As a result of the project, rail transportation costs of moving
fertilizer from the Camacari plant to the market in the Northeast are saved,
while additional coastal shipping costs are incurred for moving the Camacari
output to other regions, primarily the Center. Economic rail transport costs
between Camacari and Sergipe have been estimated at about US$11 per ton of
urea which covers all of the railway's variable costs and a portion of total
fixed costs attributable to the fertilizer traffic. Costs of coastal shipping
between the Northeast and the Center have been estimated by PETROBRAS at about
US$12 per ton of ammonia/urea. With these rather conservative cost assump-
tions it is estimated that the project will add about US$2.0 million per year
to the overall transportation costs of the economy (Annex 7-2 and 7-3). These
costs are added to the cost streams for calculation of the economic rate of
return.
D.   Economic Rate of Return
7.06      Under the assumptions outlined above, the project's economic rate
of return is 17% (Annex 7-4). This return is slightly lower than the financial
return before taxes, mainly because of higher economic costs for feedstock
(75%) and fuel (50%) and slightly lower economic revenues. The same sensitivity
tests were carried out for the economic analysis as for the financial analysis
and are summarized below:
Sergipe - Sensitivity Tests
+10%                                   + Relative Change in
- 10% Change in:                         Economic Rate of Return
Ammonia/urea prices                              3.2
Capital Costs                                    1.8
Operating Costs                                  1.4
Capacity Utilization                             2.4
Delay in Completion (1/2 year)                   1.2
Capital Costs & Completion Delay                 3.0
7.07      The economic rate of return, as the financial return, shows a high
sensitivity to changes in product prices and to a lesser degree to changes
in capital and operating costs. If gas were abundantly available, and it
could be economically justified to use it not only for feestock but also
as fuel, the economic rate of return would improve by about 1.2%. If demand
for fertilizer in the Northeast from 1980 onwards would grow at only half the



- 28 -
projected growth rate, requiring substantially larger quantities of the
project's output to be sent to other regions, the economic rate of return
would drop by only about 0.5%. Using the official instead of the shadow rate
of exchange the return would be 12%.
E.   Other Benefits
7.08      The project, by increasing Brazil's nitrogen capacity by about one-
fourth, will contribute to the stabilization of the agricultural sector by
reliably providing fertilizers to the farmers at stable prices. Also, the
plant will be located in one of the poorest and least industrialized regions
of Brazil and there will be positive spillover effects from the recuired
infrastructure and training. The project will also provide support of the
Government's policy of industrial decentralization.
7.09      The local engineering firms involved in the project implementation
will gain valuable experience (transfer of technology) which will be signi-
ficant for the execution of future chemical undertakings in Brazil. Out of a
total amount for equipment of US$121 million, US$73 million or some 60% of the
total will be supplied by local manufacturers; this constitutes an important
contribution to the development of the Brazilian industry. Of the project
management, engineering and erection services, about 80% or some US$64 million
will be provided domestically. The project's net annual foreign exchange
savings before provision for principal and interest payments on foreign loans
at 90% capacity utilization are estimated at US$65 million (in 1976 terms).
VIII. AGREEMENTS
8.01      Assurances and agreements were obtained from the Government,
PETROBRAS and FERTILIZANTES on the following major points:
1.   From the Government that it will:
(a)  Exchange views with the Bank on the development of the
fertilizer sector (para 3.12);
(b)  Take all necessary steps to assure that all funds,
including foreign exchange, are provided as required
to complete the project and that all approvals for
implementation of the project, and all necessary imports
are timely provided (para 5.08);
(c)  Not take any action with regard to the prices of raw
materials required by the project, of urea and ammonia,
and of agricultural products that would prevent FERTILI-
ZANTES from making a reasonable return on investment
under conditions of efficient operations (para 6.12);



-29 -
2.   From PETROBRAS that it will:
(a) Dedicate a minimum quantity of 3.1 billion NM3 of
natural gas to the exclusive use of the project (para
4.03);
(b) Assist FERTILIZANTES in obtaining untied foreign
exchange financing of about US$25 million equivalent
and a loan from BNDE of about US$71 million equivalent
(para 5.08);
(c) Refinance, as necessary, any loan repayments due before
project completion (para 5.08);
(d) Supply both foreign exchange and local funds, as
necessary, to complete the project, on terms and
conditions such that at project completion the
project entity will have a debt/equity ratio of
60/40 or better, and a current ratio of at least
1.2 (para 5.08);
3. From FERTILIZANTES that it will:
(a) Submit to the Bank not later than August 31, 1977 a detailed
report on the financial condition of ULTRAFERTIL and on its
plans for improving the latter's financial performance
(para 2.06);
(b) Provide the Bank not later than March 31, 1978,
with a detailed plan for recruitment, training and
staffing of the project (para 4.08);
(c) Take all necessary steps to obtain a loan from BNDE
of about US$71 million equivalent with a grace period
and maturity similar to the proposed Bank loan (para 5.05);
(d) Obtain untied foreign exchange financing through a
commercial bank loan or private placement of its debt
obligations of about US$25 million equivalent not later
than six months after the Bank's approval of the
project (para 5.06);
(e) Provide the Bank with yearly updated 5-year financial
projections for the company as a whole and for each of
its units, the first such projections to be submitted to
the Bank by July 1, 1977 (para 6.01);
(f) Observe the financial covenants as described in para 6.14.



- 30 -
8.02      In addition, as a condition of effectiveness, satisfactory arrange-
ments will have to be made for the supply of gas, vacuum gas oil, Bunker C
fuel oil, and for the construction of water and electricity supply facilities
(para 4.04).
8.03      With the assurances listed above, the project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$64 million equivalent, to be made to FERTILIZANTES, for 15
years, including four years of grace at the Bank's prevailing interest rate to
which a fee payable to the Government would be added increasing the cost to
FERTILIZANTES to 10%.

ANNEX 1

BRAZIL - SERGIPE FERTILIZER PROJECT
GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS
Ammonia.  A compound of nitrogen and hydrogen (NH3) obtained by synthesis of
nitrogen and hydrogen. It is a gas at normal atmospheric temperature and
pressure. It can be liquefied at -330C (-280F) at atmospheric pressure but
it can also be liquefied at ordinary temperatures by application of pressure.
For instance at 60F (15.50C) a pressure of 107.6 lbs. per sq. in. (7.3
kg/cm2) or about 7 atmospheres would be required. Ammonia is applied as a
fertilizer because of its high nutrient content (82% N) but it requires
special expensive equipment for storage, transportation and application
and soils having high temperatures may result in prohibitive losses.
Ammonium Carbamate. An intermediate chemical formed in solution during
synthesis of urea from carbon dioxide and ammonia. On reduction in pressure
it decomposes into urea with the formation of byproduct water. Ammonium
carbamate is a highly corrosive material and requires the use of special
materials in equipment required to handle it.
Ammonium Nitrate. A nitrogenous fertilizer containing 35% nitrogen made by
producing nitric acid as an intermediate by the oxidation of ammonia and
then reacting with additional ammonia.
Ammonium Phosphate. White crystalline solids made by the interaction of
ammonia and phosphoric acid. The two compounds of interest to the fertilizer
industry are mono-ammonium phosphate (NH4)H2P04 - (11-48-0), and di-
ammonium phosphate (NH4)2HP04 - (21-53-0).
Ammonium Sulphate. One of the earliest chemical fertilizers containing 21%
nitrogen, now produced largely as a byproduct in chemical industry. Gradually
being displaced by urea although still extensively used, and especially
suitable for certain crops notably tea.
Annhydrous Ammonia. Ammonia in pure form either in the gaseous or liquid
state having no water content.
Biuret. An impurity, NH(CONH2)2H20 found in commercial urea, brought about
by a partial decomposition of the urea to biuret and ammonia. For certain
applications, particularly when the urea is ultimately sprayed on citrus
trees, the biuret content should be kept as low as possible, in the range
0.1 to 0.3 wt. %.
Bulk Fertilizer. The term bulk fertilizer can be taken to mean commercial
fertilizer delivered to the purchaser, either in the solid or liquid state,
in a nonpackaged form to which a label cannot be attached.

Bunker C. A heavy residual fuel oil supplied to ships and industry.
Caprolactam. An intermediate in the production of Nylon-6. In the traditional
caprolactam manufacturing processes approximately 4.5 tons of byproduct
ammonium sulphate are produced per ton of caprolactam.
Chromates. Chemical compounds of chromium sometimes used in the treatment of
cooling water to inhibit scaling and corrosion.
Complex Fertilizers.  All three primary nutrients (N, P205, K20) are
frequently applied to the soil at the same time in ratios varying with the
nutrient requirements of different crops. Complex fertilizers contain at
least two chemically combined nutrients. To facilitate handling, the
several required chemicals are usually agglomerated into uniform granules for
distribution. The analysis of each nutrient is given as a ratio to describe
the NPK product. Thus 15-15-15 complex fertilizer contains 15% each of N,
P20s, and K20; and 12-24-12 complex fertilizer contains 12% N, 24% P205 and
12% K20.
Diammonium Phosphate. (See ammonium phosphate.)
Eickmeyer Catacarb Process. A liquid scrubbing process for the removal of
carbon dioxide from synthesis gas using hot potassium carbonate solution
containing an amine-borate activator and corrosion inhibitor. Process
developed and licensed by Eickmeyer and Associates.
Gas Oil. The heaviest vaporizable fraction of petroleum having a viscosity
and boiling range between kerosine and lubricating oil. So called because of
its previous extensive use in the gas industry in the production of carburetted
water gas.
Heavy Fuel Oil. A mixture of the liquid residues from refinery distillation
and cracking processes blended with fractions of suitable boiling point range
from the distillation of crude oil.
K22. Historically the potassium nutrient content of a fertilizer has been
expressed in terms of potassium oxide equivalent (K20), even though K20 as
such is never found in fertilizer.
Liquid Ammonia. Ammonia in the liquid phase either by virtue of high pressure,
refrigeration or a combination of the two.
MAP. Mono-ammonium phosphate (see ammonium phosphate).
Muriate of Potash.  The principal source of potassium for fertilizer.
Muriate of potash, the chemical name of which is potassium chloride, is
usually sold on the basis of material containing 95-99% KC1, with a K 20
equivalent of 60-62%.

Naphtha. A light petroleum distillate between kerosine and gasoline having
a final boiling point up to 2200C.
Nitric Acid. A strong mineral acid. It is produced by the partial oxidation
of ammonia over a metallic catalyst and dissolving the reaction products in
water.
Nitrochalk.  A mixture of ammonium nitrate and finely pulverized limestone
approximately in the ratio three p arts to two by weight. The material
contains 20.5% N.
NPK. (See complex fertilizers.)
Nutrient. Any element taken in by a plant, essential to its growth, and
used by it in elaboration of its food and tissue. The primary plant
nutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K). (See also
complex fertilizers.)
P2O . Traditionally the phosphorous nutrient content of a fertilizer has
Veen expressed in terms of the available phosphate equivalent (P205).
Phosphate Rock. Phosphate-bearing ore composed largely of tricalcium
phosphate. Phosphate rock can be treated with strong acids or heat to make
available forms of phosphate.   Finely ground rock phosphate is sometimes
used in long-time fertility programs.
Phosphoric Acid. (H3POh). An inorganic acid used in the manufacture of
concentrated calcium phosphates, ammonium phosphates and sometimes for
direct application through irrigation water.
Potash.  A term used to denote the potassium oxide (K20) equivalent of
materials containing potassium.  (See also K20.)
Potassium Chloride.  A salt containing not less than 48% potash chiefly as
chlorides and the principal source of potassium.
Pbtassium Sulphate. A salt containing not less than 48% potash, chiefly as
sulphate, and not more than 2.5% chlorine.
Prills. Spherical particles prepared by spraying molten material down-
ward through a countercurrent stream of cooling air; this operation is
performed in a prilling tower. The particles obtained have excellent
storage and handling properties in that they are hard and have less surface
area than crystals.

Refinery Gas. A mixture of gases gathered in a petroleum refinery from
the various refining units.
Simple Superphosphate. A product obtained by treating phosphate rock
with sulfuric acid and consisting of a mixture of monocalcium phosphate
CaH4(PO4)2, dicalcium phosphate CaHPO4, tricalcium phosphate Ca3(P04)2, calcium
sulphate and other impurities. Tricalcium phosphate is totally insoluble and
is not included in the P205 content of the superphosphate (16% to 18%).
Sulfuric Acid. A strong acid made from various sulfur materials. It is used
in the manufacture of fertilizers such as ammonium sulphate and super-
phosphate.
Triple Superphosphate. Obtained by reaction of phosphate rock and
phosphoric acid. Since it contains no calcium sulphate, its P205 content
(about 46%) is much higher than in single superphosphate.
Urea. Urea is known chemically as carbamide or NH2CONH2--the normal amide
of carbonic acid; this compound contains about 46% N, all in the ammonium
form. It is considerably less hygroscopic than ammonium nitrate and it is
the most widely used straight nitrogen fertilizer today.
Vacuum Gas Oil. A distillate produced from the distillation of residual oil
under vacuum.

BRAZIL - SERGIFE FERTILIZER PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF PROJBCT SPONSORS
1.        The Sergipe project is sponsored by Petroleo Brasileiro S.A.
(PETROBRAS) which will supply all the equity funds for the project. Responsi-
bility for implementation of the project is with PETROBRAS' fertilizer project
implementation unit (COFEN) supported by PETROBRAS engineering department on
behalf of a recently created wholly owned subsidiary, Petrobras Fertilizantes
S.A. (FERTILIZANTES). FERTILIZANTES' proposed organization chart is shown in
Chart I. FERTILIZANTES will be the owner of the project and has responsibility
for procurement of all but critical items required by the project and for
recruiting and training the staff necessary to operate and manage the plant
once it is completed.  FERTILIZANTES was established to consolidate PETROBRAS'
existing and future fertilizer interests. Until the end of 1976, PETROBRAS'
existing fertilizer operations were owned by Petrobras Quimica S.A. (PETROQUISA)
also a wholly owned subsidiary of PETROBRAS. By early 1977, however, control
over these operations has been given to FERTILIZANTES so that PETROQUISA
will not any longer be involved in the fertilizer sector. A description of
PETROBRAS and the existing fertilizer operations is given below.
I. Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. (PETROBRAS)
2.        PEIROBRAS is the Government oil company established in 1953.  It
owns eight existing refineries, has a large retail system and is responsible
for petroleum exploration, all imports and petroleum and gas production.
There are two small refineries not owned by PETROBRAS. However, they cannot
expand and must buy crude from PETROBRAS. There are some private oil distri-
butors/retailers but they buy refined products from PETROBRAS and retail
prices are controlled by the Government.
PETROBRAS' corporate organization chart is shown in Chart II, and
the consolidated statements for PETROBRAS and its subsidiaries are shown in
Tables 1-5.
PETROBRAS' consolidated investment program was US$0.6 billion in
1973 but increased sharply to US$0.9 billion and about US$1.4 billion
during 1974 and 1975, respectively, and is expected to remain at this
level for the next four years. Historically (1972-1975) internal funds
provided 54% of the total fund sources with new capital including special
Government contributions adding 15% and new debt 31%. More than one-half
of the funds, about 54%, were utilized for capital investments with the
balance used for debt service, additional working capital and dividend
payments. Assuming that the new capital and new loans were used exclusively
to finance capital investments, the investment program would have been financed
with 15% internal funds, 28% new capital and 57% debt which is a sound
capitalization structure. Substantially the same pattern of fund sources and
uses are projected for the next four years.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
PETROBRAS has typically been using foreign commercial bank lines
of credit, and tied export or buyer's credits, to finance imported goods.
These credits, arranged well in advance of disbursement, are not initially
allocated to a specific project. While these buyer's credits are always tied,
PETROBRAS, by using them on an unallocated basis coupled with negotiations,
apparently has not suffered any particular price disadvantage vis-a-vis ICB.
II. Existing Fertilizer Operations
1.        Fabrica de Fertilizantes (FAFER)
FAFER was established in the early 1950s to use the refinery gas
of the Cubatao (Sao Paulo) refinery for the production of ammonia, nitric
acid, ammonium nitrate and nitrochalk with a concentration of 27% nitrogen
(N) to be used as fertilizer. The plant also has a sulfur recovery unit
extracting sulfur from the refinery gas. Production started in 1956, but
it was only in 1958 that all start-up problems had been overcome and a
capacity utilization of 80% reached.
In 1974 FAFER started its nitric acid concentration unit which
concentrates the plant's acid of 54% to 63% and 99%. Actual fertilizer
production in 1975 reached about 25,000 tons of N which equals about 12% of
Brazil's domestic production of N and 6% of Brazil's N consumption in 1975.
A summary of the unit's production is given below:
HISTORICAL PRODUCTION OF FAFER
(in tons)
Product          1973      1974       1975
Nitric Acid (54%)    15,317    23,926      9,539
Nitric Acid (63%)      -         7,910       434
Nitric Acid (99%)      -           674     8,710
Nitrochalk           86,390    95,738    92,387
Ammonia for Sale      1,884      1,785     4,295
Ammonium Nitrate     11,893    114,836    11,232
Sulfur                2,478        511     4,076
Ammonia production has suffered in the past from irregularities of
refinery gas supply because of extensive overhauls and modernizations in the
refinery. FAFER has therefore imported ammonia when required to maintain
full production of the other units in the plant.
Although the plant has now been in production for 20 years, it
still operates with a small profit margin, and it is expected that the plant
can continue to operate in this manner for a number of years.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
Originally, FAFER was a subsidiary of PETROBRAS, but with the
creation of PETROQUISA in 1967 it became an operating unit of PETROQUISA.
With the reorganization of PETROBRAS fertilizer operations at the beginning
of 1977, FAFER became an operating division of ULTRAFERTIL.
2.        Industria e Comercio de Fertilizantes S.A. (ULrRAFERTIL)
ULTRAFERTIL was established in 1966 as a joint venture between
Phillips Petroleum, a US petroleum and fertilizer company, the Brazilian
Ultra group and IFC. In 1974, because of financial difficulties, Fhillips
sold its shares to PETROQUISA and ownership of the company now is to 85%
with FERTILIZANTES, 10% with the Ultra group and about 5% with IFC.
The company's facilities at Cubatao (Sao Paulo) include a 450 ton
per day naphtha based ammonia plant with auxiliary facilities to produce
ammonium nitrate and diammonium phosphate fertilizers. Pbrt-
handling facilities for ammonia and fertilizer materials are also included.
At present, the company is completing an ammonia storage tank of 20,000
tons capacity and is altering the ammonia nitrate plant to produce calcium
ammonium sulphate in the future.
Together with its production facilities at Cubatao, ULTRAFERTIL
established 14 distribution centers intended to handle about half of the
company's total production. The centers are located in South Central
Brazil, the market area for ULTRAFERTIL. However, soon after production
had started in late 1970 it became apparent that the distribution centers
were overdesigned and only six of them are now operating, the other being
used for storage.
Production has been reasonably stable with capacity utilization
for the whole plant averaging about 90% over the last three years:

With a total N production of around 90,000 Tfl, ULTRAFERTIL is
presently the largest producer of N in Brazil. ULTRAFF1IL's production
equals about 56% of Brazil's domestic production of N and 21% of its
consumption in 1975.
Because ULTRAFETIL also mixes and blends fertilizer materials,
part of which is imported, its sales are very diversified as shown below:

TOTAL                 617    567    582        301
The sales volume has been rather stable over the last three years,
and 1976 sales are expected to follow the same trend, although sales of
complex fertilizers are lagging behind.
ULTRAFERTIL's financial performance has been less than satisfactory
(Table 6). In 1974 the company made, after three years of operation, its
first profit of US$21.5 million, which reduced the accumulated deficit from
US$33.2 million at the end of 1973 to US$11.7 million at the end of 1974.
Profitability in 1975 was marginal with net income being only about 1% of
net revenues and a sizeable loss of around US$10 million is projected for
1976. As a consequence of the poor performance, the debt/equity ratio
deteriorated to 95/5 in 1973, but has improved in 1974 and 1975 to about
60/40. The debt service coverage has been only between 0.3 and 0.5
except in 1974 when it was satisfactory with 1.3. Additional long-term
debt and share capital contributions from PETROQUISA provided the necessary
funds to keep ULTRAFERTIL alive.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
The reasons for ULTRAFERTIL's poor financial performance are
manifold. While the company's production performance has been satisfactory,
production costs have been high caused partly by built-in inefficiencies in
the plant and partly by high overheads. Also, ULTRAFERTIL had initially
difficulties obtaining Government approval for sales price increases for their
products. In addition, ULTRAFERTIL is affected by the import quotas, which
are established at times of low international fertilizer prices to protect
the domestic industry. These quotas, however, are dependent on consumption
and production forecasts which are never completely accurate. As a result,
there might be an excess of imports, which penalizes higher-cost domestic
producers such as ULTRAFERTIL or not enough imports which restricts overall
growth of fertilizer consumption.
3.        Petrobras Quimica Fertilizantes S.A. (PErROFERTIL)
PETROrFERIL was established in 1966 and started production of
ammonia and urea in 1971. The production facilities consist of a 200 TPD
ammonia and a 250 TPD urea plant. The plant is located in the Salvador
petrochemical complex in Camacari, close to Salvador (Bahia). Natural gas
from oil and gas fields of the state of Bahia is used as feedstock and fuel.
The following table gives production and capacity utilization since
the beginning of production:
PETROFERTIL - PRODUCTION HISTCRY

Urea                   3.8      47.3    66.3    77.8    77.5
Capacity Utilization
Ammonia Plant          5%       52%     65%     79%      79%
Urea Plant             5%       57%     80%     94%      94%
Overall                5%       55%     73%     87%      87%
Production performance has thus been satisfactory with the company's overall
capacity utilization now stabilizing at about 87%.
Financially, the company is very strong (Table 7), which is some-
what surprising because ammonia plants of this size cannot compete with
modern large-scale plants. The reason for the canpany's high profitability
lies in the fact that a considerable portion of the fixed asset costs were
absorbed by PETROBRAS before transferring the plant to PETROFERTIL. De-
preciation and financial charges are therefore very low, and the company's
ammonia and urea production costs are even lower than prices for imported
material. Debt/equity and current ratio are also satisfactory.



ANNEX 2
Page 6-
The company is presently expanding its production facilities and
is adding a 900 TPD ammonia and an 800 TPD urea plant which will also use
natural gas as feedstock and fuel. However, as for the Sergipe project,
the plant is designed to also use vacuum gas oil for fuel if it is
necessary to conserve gas. Production from the new plant will start at
the end of 1977. PETROFERTIL will then be the largest nitrogen producer
in Brazil. By that time, the company expects that the output of the
presently producing plant will be consumed entirely by non-fertilizer users.

ANNEX3-
BRAZIL - SERGIPE FERTILIZER ROJECT
AGRICULTURE IN BRAZIL
A. Development and Government PolicY
1.        Over the period 1967-75, the agricultural sector has performed
well in supplying domestic demand for food and fibers while producing a
rising volume of export comiodities, with output growing at an average of
5.5% annually despite adverse climatic conditions in four out of nine years.L/
The agriculture sector's contribution to NDP has declined from 20% in 1967
to about 15% at present, but its contribution to exports has remained
significant and currently accounts for over 50% of the total value of exports.
Because of the seriousness of the balance of payments constraint, the strategy
of Brazil's Second National Development Plan (1975-79) aims at a more
efficient development of Brazil's agricultural potential. Besides its
favorable impact on balance of payments, the new growth strategy also has
favorable implications for domestic price stabilization and equality of income
distribution.
2.        Until 1970, growth in agricultural production was attributable
almost entirely to expansion of land under cultivation. Little if any
effort was expended on improvement of productivity in agriculture. Inspite
of having been relatively neglected by policy makers, the agricultural sector
managed to grow at about 4.5% annually during 1950-70. Inflation, price con-
trols, erratic Government intervention in marketing of products, overvalued
exchange rates and export controls, tended to distort prices particularly in
the early 1960s, discouraging production and exports. The movement of agri-
cultural activity into the interior of the country created a need for an
elaborate infrastructure to handle product distribution which remained largely
neglected untili the mid-1960s. Changes in overall economic management since
then have helped to eliminate some of these distortions and improve incentives
for farmers. Recent growth has tended to be higher, although there have been
fluctuations due to climatic factors. Brazil has become the world's largest
producer of sugar and its second largest supplier of soybeans, while remain-
ing the world's leading coffee producer. Coffee continues to play a very
important role in the agricultural sector accounting for about 12% of output,
though its share in total exports has declined from 44% in 1967 to about
11% in 1975. It is expected to rise to almost 17% in 1976 despite a lower
volume of exports than 1975 due to a large price increase. Annual variations
in coffee production, largely resulting from frosts, are generally responsible
for year-to-year fluctuations in the growth of the agriculture sector. The
1975 frosts which caused extensive crop damage in the states of Sao Paulo,
Parana, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso, will result in an estimated 70% decline
in coffee production in 1976 and will reduce overall growth of the agriculture
sector from an estimated 4% in 1975 to between 0-2% growth in 1976.
1/ Tables 1-4 of this Annex gives some basic agricultural statistics about
development of area, production and yield of the country's main crops.



ANNEX 3-1
Page 2
3.        The agricultural policies of the Government have multiple objec-
tives: they are designed to stimulate output to meet the increasing demand
of Brazil's population, to encourage production for export to make a substan-
tial contribution to foreign exchange earnings; and, as instruments for raising
income levels of the rural poor. The Government's price stabilization
objectives depend upon the extent to which agricultural production meets the
increases in domestic demand. More balanced and abundant increments in
production relative to population increase would alleviate the commodity
scarcities which have complicated stabilization efforts in recent years. The
agriculture sector in Brazil, besides employing relatively little in way of
imported inputs, has enormous potential as a supplier of primary commodities
to a world increasingly afflicted by food shortages. Agriculture is and will
continue for some time to be a key generator of foreign exchange. The aim of
the Government is to make Brazil one of the world's foremost producers and
exporters of foodstuffs.  Finally, with almost 45% of the population engaged
in agricultural activities, a more balanced and equitable development process
can only be achieved with comparatively higher increases in agricultural pro-
duction and productivity than those experienced in recent years. Substantial
increases in per worker productivity in the rural areas can alleviate poverty
where it currently is most heavily concentrated. The Government is thus
giving more attention to the modernization of agricultural production and
marketing and expansion of the frontier of cultivation.
4.        Brazil has the potential for sustaining relatively high long-term
growth in agriculture and the Plan target of a 40% (7% annually) real increase
in agricultural output for the 1975-79 period appears feasible. To support
these growth objectives, the Government has allocated substantial public
resources to programs to incorporate new areas to agricultural production.
Brazil is one of the few countries in the world that still has available
abundant land on which continued expansion of output can be based, so that
reasonably high growth is possible if accompanied by modestimprovements in
agricultural technology. The goal of these programs is to expand agricul-
tural area by 5% annually and to encourage settlement to bring these areas
into production as quickly as possible. A second component of the Government
strategy is to increase productivity and production options through moderni-
zation of agriculture research and increase domestic production of improved
seeds, fertilizers, and substantial expansion in the supply of credit and
complementary technical assistance for the purchase of modern agricultural
inputs. These inputs should bring about a 2% annual increase in productivity
necessary to achieve the overall growth target for the agriculture sector.
Government policies and programs are already stimulating considerable progress
both in expanding land under cultivation and increasing productivity of
activities for domestic and external markets.
5.        Following the example of the comprehensive programs created in the
early 1970s for the development of Northeast agriculture (PROTERRA), the
Amazon (PIN), Mato Grosso and Goias (PRODESTE), Valley of the Sao Franciso
River (PROVALE), the Government in 1974, launched a program (POLOCENTRO) to
focus on the technical and infrastructure requirements for initially exploit-
ing 3.7 million hectares of land area in the Campos Cerrados area. This



ANNEX 3-1
Page 3
program will also finance agricultural research, feeder roads, rural
electrification and agricultural storage facilities. The Government has also
initiated a program (POLONORDESTE) designed to improve small farmer productivity
in the Northeast through the formulation and execution of integrated rural
development projects. This constitutes a significant shift in the emphasis of
governmental programs which in the past have concentrated on expanding socially
oriented programs in the fields of education, health, nutrition, sanitation
and broadening the application of social security and labor legislation rather
than on production oriented programs aimed at low income groups. These re-
gional programs are designed to bring about a fuller utilization of the
country's land and related resources in order to provide a means for the
alleviation of poverty and underemployment, which are particularly pressing
in the Northeast. Whiile no overnight eradication of rural poverty, which has
been endemic in the Northeast for decades, is likely to be forthcoming from
these programs, responsible efforts to improve the productivity of Northeast
agriculture together with programs to increase industrial activity in the
region already have resulted in a more rapid growth of per capita income in
the Northeast than in Brazil as a whole, and with the initiation of new pro-
grams this process is expected to continue under the Second Development Plan.
6.        Considerable emphasis is also being given to agricultural research
and to the dissemination of research findings through a national extension
network. The Brazilian Agricultural Research Enterprise (EMBRAPA) and the
Brazilian Technical Assistance and Rural Extension Enterprise (EMBRATER) have
been strengthened to carry out these objectives.  Guaranteed minimum price
support and subsidized credit for financing acquisition of modern inputs are
being employed to encourage farmers to take advantage of technological improve-
ments resulting from these research and extension activities. A program of
agricultural infrastructure improvements (Export Corridors Program) is being
implemented in the South and Center regions to facilitate movement of export-
able agricultural surpluses from the interior of Brazil through the major
ports of the region (Vitoria, Santos, Paranagua and Rio Grande).
7.        Since 1965, with the creation of the National System of Rural
Credit, the Government has made a continuous effort to increase the amount
of loanable funds for agriculture. Agricultural credit is crucial to reso-
lution of the challenges confronting Brazilian agriculture, particularly
expansion of land under cultivation and use of modern inputs. Currently,
about 27% of total Brazilian bank credit is directed into agriculture prin-
cipally by the Bank of Brazil and through Central Bank refinancing programs
using the private commercial banks as agents. Agricultural credit as a per-
cent of Brazil's agricultural domestic income has increased from about 23%
in 1966 to over 80% in 197L. Agricultural credit lines are available for a
multiplicity of purposes including working capital, acquisition of modern
inputs, irrigation, land acquisition by small holders, retention of breeding
stock, pasture improvement, etc. Agricultural credit is extended at subsi-
dized interest rates differentiated in favor of the small holders and of
development in certain regions, particularly the Northeast. The Government
has also established an insurance scheme or fund to cover debts of farmers



ANNEX 3-1

when affected by natural disasters. This Insurance Program for Agricultural
and Livestock Activities (PROAGRO) has been extremely useful in reducing
risk of credit operations both to lenders and borrowers. The Government
recently extended this coverage to 80% of the losses in Parana guaranteed
under the PROAGRO program when the State was devastated by the severe frosts
of mid-1975.
8.        A major difference between the approach of the Second National
Development Plan and efforts heretofore made to improve Brazil's agricul-
tural performance lies in better coordination of the activities of the
many agricultural development agencies. Institutional changes made since
March 1974 suggest that for the first time there is a chance for effective
coordination between agro-policy makers, agricultural research and extension
agencies, agrarian reform and regional development agencies.
B. Major Export Crops
9.        Three agricultural commodities, coffee, soybeans and sugar,
generate over 35% of total export earnings and, including unprocessed or semi-
processed agricultural exports, the agricultural sector accounts for more
than 50% of total value of exports. The diversification of agricultural
exports, which over 1967-75 period has been more important than even the
spectacular growth of manufactured exports, is all the more remarkable since,
unlike manufacturers, they benefit little from fiscal incentives.
10.       Brazil is the largest exporter of coffee in the world although its
share of the world market has declined from 5   in the early 1950s to an
estimated 20% in 1976. With the exception of the 1965-66 harvest, domestic
production has been consistently below requirements for domestic consumption
(8 million bags) and exports (18 million bags), leading to a gradual depletion
of stocks. Due to a large build-up of stocks and the tremendous excess of
production capacity in 1966, the Government initiated a coffee tree eradication
program. However, the movement of coffee planting into the interior of the
state of Parana by the early 1960s had left substantial portions of Brazil's
production capacity exposed to frosts. After the frosts of 1969 which reduced
1970 crop to less than 11 million bags, the Government was forced to reverse
its policy and establish price and credit incentives for new tree planting.
The impact of the program was felt in 1974 with production of some 26 million
bags. The severe frosts of 1975, which drastically reduced production capacity
with an estimated production of 6 million bags in 1976, may start a new phase
in Brazilian coffee history, and coffee production may gradually move out of
frost-prone Parana. The danger of movement into the over-production stage of
the coffee cycle still exists, though greater attention on the part of the
Government and the declining comparative advantage of coffee over other crops
tend to forestall this. The increased cost of fertilizer and pesticide, and
the emerging shortage of agricultural labor in the coffee regions discrimi-
nates severely against coffee since no mechanized means of coffee harvesting
has ever been developed. Continuation of a moderate coffee tree planting



ANNEX 3-1
Page 5
program at moderate levels should maintain Brazilian production capacity at
adequate levels, and should permit the Government to recoup the decline in
Brazil's share in world exports that occurred in 1974-76.
11.       With the recent decline in Cuban production, Brazil is now7 the
largest producer of sugar in the world. Until 1970 sugar production in-
creased very slowly but, in response to rapidly rising world prices, large
increases took place in 1972 and 1973. Due to unusually bad weather (drought
and frosts in Center-South and heavy, unseasonable rains in the Northeast),
production declined in 1974 and 1975, and despite exhaustion of its sugar
stocks early in 1974, Brazilian sugar export in that year surpassed coffee as
Brazil's principal foreign exchange earner. Most of the increases in cane
production have been due to expansion in harvested areas, with practically no
increases in average yields. Increases in Brazil s exportable sugar surplus
(from 1.1 million tons in 1968 to peak of 2.8 million tons in 1973 with 1975
exports of only 1.7 million tons) have been facilitated by a Government
program to reform the production and processing of sugar in the Northeast.
This reform has various elements including the creation of credit lines
to merge and re-equip sugar mills and to integrate and reallocate cane
production and milling; the adoption of a uniform sugar price throughout
the country; the establishment of a gradually declining subsidy to be
eliminated over a six-year period, to compensate for the currently higher
production costs of the Northeast; and the allocation of PROTERRA funds to
finance the re-employment of cane and mill workers displaced by productivity
improvements. Additional planting of land area in sugarcane and improvements
in productivity are expected to increase sugar production from about 7.7
million tons at present to about 10 million tons by 1980, out of which only
23% would be for exports due to growing requirements for domestic consumption.
12.       The production of soybeans has increased from less than 1 million
tons in 1968 to an estimated 11 million tons in 1976, making Brazil the third
largest producer in the world, behind the U.S. and the People's Republic of
China. Soybeans represent the most startling example of the speed at which
new products have been added to the export flow as exports of soybeans, soy-
bean meal and soybean .oil increased from US$40 million in 1967 to US$1,302
million in 1975. This vast expansion has taken place mainly in the states of
Sao Paulo, Parana, and Rio Grande do Sul and has been instrumental in re-
structuring southern Brazilian agriculture. Up to 1975, most of the expansion
came from double-cropping of wheat areas and cultivation of natural pastures
and thus has not provoked any significant reduction in the output of alternative
crops. In addition, per hectare productivity has increased and at present
Brazilian productivity is only slightly lower than in the U.S. and Canada,
and higher than in Japan. Most of the Southern region presents favorable
conditions and sufficient land available for further expansion of soybean
cultivation. The area under soybean cultivation is expected to increase from
5.2 million hectares in 1974 to 10.5 million hectares by 1980, and production

is expected to reach 18 million tons, with exportable surplus at 11-12 million
tons compared to 6.7 million tons in 1975. In terms of production capacity,
soybeans clearly constitute one of Brazil's principal opportunities for
expansion of agricultural exports.

BRAZIL - SERGIPE FERTILIZER PROJECT
THE FERTILIZER SECTOR
A. Fertilizer Industry - General Backaround
(i) Resource Endowment
1.        Brazil is not well-endowed with good raw material resources for the
production of chemical fertilizers. Natural gas, the ideal raw material
for nitrogen (N) fertilizer production, has been found only in modest
quantities in three areas: (a) Sergipe and Alagoas (Northeast), (b) offshore
of Campos, near Rio de Janeiro (Center), and (c) 200 Ian offshore of Amapa
(North). The reserves in the Northeast have been known the longest and
they have the advantage of being located close to the Northeast fertilizer
consumption center. These reserves are limited in size but will provide
the feedstock for the Sergipe project and PETROFERTIL's existing and
presently expanded ammonia/urea plant. The oil and gas fields offshore
Campos have just been discovered,and priority for the use of this gas has
been given to fertilizer production. At this time, no information is avail-
able on the likely quantities involved. The gas in the North has also just
been discovered, but the location of the reserves will make exploitation
difficult, and it is not likely that gas from these fields will be used
for fertilizer production in the near future. The other feedstocks for N
fertilizer production, naphtha and fuel oil, are indirectly imported as
they are derived from crude oil,and Brazil imports some 80% of its crude
oil requirements. The Araucaria fertilizer project under construction at
Parana will use fuel oil, and the proposed project in Rio Grande do Sul
will probably also use fuel oil feedstock.
There are six major deposits of phosphate rock (Table 1 and MAP
IBRD 12055R.) with an average P205 content ranging from 5% to 17%, well below
the 20% to 30% average P205 content found in comercial deposits in other
countries (USA, Morocco, Jordan, etc.). At present, only one deposit
(Jacupiranga with an average of 5% P205 ore grade) is commercially develop-
ed, in conjunction with a cement factory, which improves the economics of
the combined cement/phosphate fertilizer enterprise. The Jacupiranga
deposit provides the rock for the QUIMBRASIL fertilizer plant and accounts
for just about 8% of the 1976 P205 consumption. However, with the recent
local development of a commercial beneficiation technology capable of
producing ore concentrates with 35% P205 at a high recovery factor_/ and
the increase in the international prices of phosphate rock and phosphatic (P)
fertilizers, Brazil has embarked on a phosphate mining/beneficiation
l/ The beneficiation process is now well proven at Jacupiranga and the
Arafertil pilot plant at Araxa.  A unique feature of the process is
its ability to attain a fair, from 50% to 80%, P205 recovery from
the low grade igneous ores common in Brazil.  On a comparable basis,
the standard metallurgical process used on U.S. sedimentary type ore
in the 5% to 8% P205 range shows recovery factors of about 30% to 50%.

investment program to develop its low grade deposits. The ARAFERTIL mining/
beneficiation project at Araxa and the VALEP project at Tapira are scheduled
for commercial operation by mid-1977 and late-1978, respectively. Feasibility
studies for developing the Catalao deposit, the Patos de Minas deposit and
the Ipanema deposit are underway. These six deposits have potential reserves
of about 345 million tons of P205 of which about one half can be considered
as proven. With an average P205 recovery factor of 60%, the proven reserves
of about 170 million tons of P205 is equivalent to 90 times the 1976 annual
P205 consumption. Elemental sulfur, another important raw material for
phosphoric acid production, has not been found in comnercial quantities in
Brazil.
2.        Finally, only one significant potash (K) deposit has been found,
in Carmopolis (Sergipe). The deposit is in the form of potassium
chlorinated salts with the equivalent of at least 30 million tons of K20
or equal to about 50 times the 1976 annual consumption. However, the
existence of oil in the same area, the lack of adequate technology, and the
disagreement among the different parties concerned have so far prevented
the commercial development of this deposit. Consequently, all potash require-
ments will continue to be imported for some time.
(ii) Industrial Structure
3.        With international prices for raw materials, intermediates
(phosphoric acid and ammonia) and fertilizer products relatively low up to
1973 and because of Brazil's low natural resource endowment, the Brazilian
fertilizer industry has concentrated on importing, mixing, blending and
the distribution of fertilizers, rather than on establishing large scale,
efficient production facilities. Brazil's fertilizer industry, therefore,
consists of a large number of small to medium-sized, mostly private sector,
firms with relatively uneconomic production facilities. Because of their
high production costs, producers have to be protected except when world
fertilizer prices are high. Over the next five years, however, the industry
will undergo major changes, with new and larger facilities providing
economies of scale and being mostly owned by public sector enterprises, not-
withstanding the Government's policy of encouraging the private sector to
invest in the industry. The large financial requirements for new projects
will prevent the private sector, with its limited financial base, from
participating in a major way in the capacity expansion of the industry.
Consequently, the new, large-scale projects have to be financed and under-
taken with the help of sources outside the present industry. Most of the
new projects are, therefore, sponsored by the large, Government-owned
industrial enterprises such as Petroleo Brasileiro (PETROBRAS), the national
oil company, and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce S.A. (CVRD), a large mining company.
However, it is expected that the blending, mixing and distribution of
fertilizer products will continue to be in the private sector.
4.        At present, there are 20 firms producing fertilizers and about
30 more enterprises just engaged in mixing, blending and retail operations.
Of the 20 producers, only one firm (ULTRAFERTIL) has primary production
facilities for both ammonia and phosphoric acid; three firms (PETROFERTIL,



ANNEX 3-2
Page 3
FAFER and RHODIA) have amonia production units; and two firms (COPEBRAS
and QUIMBRASIL) have phosphoric acid production facilities. However, only
QUIMBRASIL uses local phosphate rock. Both COPEBRAS and ULTRAFERTIL use
imported rock. The other 14 manufacturing firms import the intermediate
products (ammonia and/or phosphoric acid) for final processing and/or
produce low analysis products such as thermophosphates and single super-
phosphates (SSP) which do not require phosphoric acid and ammonia. Of the
20 firms, five produce complex (NP and NPK) fertilizers, another five produce
just N fertilizers, and the remaining ten P fertilizers only.
5.        Following the extraordinary increase in international fertilizer
prices in 1974 (Chart I) which almost tripled the fertilizer import bill from the
US$169 million in 1973 to US$492 million in 1974 and about US$500 million
in 1975, the Government initiated a National Fertilizer Program (NFP) which
stipulated self-sufficiency in fertilizer by 1980. To implement the NFP,
the Government established the National Fertilizer Commission with
representatives from the Ministries of Finance, Industry, Commerce, Transport,
Agriculture, and Planning. The Commission has overall responsibility for
planning and formulating policies to facilitate the growth of the industry,
especially the expansion of the production capacity.
As a result of the NFP, three new large-scale ammonia/urea
projects are now firmly planned at Araucaria (under construction), Sergipe
and Norte Fluminense, all of which will be undertaken by FERTILIZANTES, a
subsidiary of PETROBRAS. The three projects will almost triple the ammonia
capacity from the 1977 level of 477,000 TPI of N to 1,300,000 TPY of N
by 1981.
6.        One large public sector phosphate fertilizer project is under
construction by VALEFERTIL, a CVRD subsidiary, which will more than double
the domestic phosphoric acid production capacity from 220,000 TPY of P205
to 510,000 TPY of P205. Three other large phosphate fertilizer projects
are planned in the private sector, but all face serious financing problems
and are not expected to start production until 1981 or later. The three
are: the ARAFERTIL project at Araxa, the Luchsinger project in the South,
and the ICC project, also in the South. Both the ARAFERTIL and the
Luchsinger projects will have phosphoric acid capacities of about 190,000
TPY of P205 and the ICC project 105,000 TPY of P205. However, only the
VAIEFERTIL and the ARAFERTIL projects will be based on local phosphate rock.
The two projects in the South will have to use imported phosphate rock as
no phosphate deposit has been discovered in that region.
In all, there are nine firm projects, supported by the NFP, which
are estimated to cost almost US$1.9 billion and include four phosphate rock
mining/beneficiation projects (Araxa, Tapira, Ipanema, Patos), two phosphate
fertilizer projects (VALEFERTIL, ARAFERTIL), and three ammonia/urea projects
(Araucaria, Sergipe, Norte Fluminense).
7.        There are four industrial associations for the fertilizer industry:
(a) The Associacao Nacional Para Difusao de Adubos (ANDA), which is
responsible for the general promotion of and research on fertilizer use;



ANNEX 3-2
Page 4
(b) The Syndicato de Materias Primas, which represents the domestic producers
of fertilizers, (c) The Syndicato da Industria de Adubos e Colas do Estado
de Sao Paulo, and (d) The Syndicato Estado de Rio Grande. The last two
associations represent blenders, mixers and retailers. ANDA also acts as
consultant to the Government and in the past has engaged the services of
foreign firms (e.g. Tennessee Valley Authority and FAO) for special projects.
The syndicates collect and disseminate information on consumption, production,
stocks and distribution. They also prepare special studies to support the
industry's views to the Government whenever changes in prices, subsidies
and import quotas are contemplated. With the Government's manifest interest
in the industry, the associations have begun to improve their system of data
collection, their role as information sources and are now engaged in fore-
casting likely fertilizer consumption levels.
B. Agriculture and Fertilizer Use
(i) Factors Affecting Fertilizer Use
8.        Four main factors, other than weather, affect the fertilizer
usage in Brazil. These are: (a) the development of the cultivated area;
(b) soil characteristics; (c) the cropping pattern and the level of
agricultural technology; and (d) the Government policies concerning relative
agricultural input and output prices, subsidies, credit, agricultural
extension services and special programs related to agriculture. The
Government's agricultural policies are generally discussed in Annex 3-1,
and fertilizer prices and subsidies are discussed in Section C of
this Annex.
9.        Table 2 provides information on the potential agricultural areas
that could be developed in the different regions of Brazil. The total
potential agricultural area that could be used is estimated to be between
165 to 250 million ha. with a best estimate of 210 million ha. During the
period 1960-1970, cultivated area increased at an annual rate of 3%, from
28.5 to 38.5 million ha. During 1970-1975, however, the cultivated area
increased only slightly (Annex 3-1, Table 2) and for 1975 was about 41.5
million ha., representing just about 20% of the estimated potential of 210
million ha. Thus, the Government's Second Development Plan (1975-79)
objective of increasing the cultivated area by 4% to 5% annually is slightly
higher than the average rate achieved in the past.
Brazilian soils are generally acidic and seriously deficient in
phosphorus. Table 3 shows the average phosphorus and potassium content of
the soils by states, indicating that on a national basis, an average of 77%
of the presently cultivated area is low in phosphorus (or phosphate) with
the remaining 23% containing medium to high levels of natural phosphate
nutrients. In contrast, only about 29% of the cultivated area is considered
seriously deficient in potassium (or potash). This deficiency in phosphorus
coupled with the acidity of the soil has led to the unusual NPK consumption
ratio of about 1:2.3:1.3 (average for the period 1972-1976), with phosphate
consumption more than twice the nitrogen consumption. The planned
increase in cultivated area, mostly involving soils with nutrient deficiencies,



ANNEX 3-2
Page 5
will clearly require an increase in fertilizer use, especially phosphatic
fertilizers. To correct for soil acidity, large quantities of lime are
applied since acidity is not compatible with most crops and in addition,
the efficiency of N fertilizers is reduced, depressing agricultural yields.
There are adequate domestic lime deposits and production capacity.
10.       The cropping pattern and the level of agricultural technology is
the third important factor affecting fertilizer use. As shown below, there
has been a marked change in the cropping pattern. The area cultivated with
coffee, for example, decreased from 4.4 million ha. in 1960 (15.4% of the
cultivated area) to 1.4 million ha. in 1976 (3.2% of the cultivated area).
In contrast, the area planted with soybeans increased from a 1960 level
of 0.2 million ha. (0.7% of the cultivated area) to a 1976 level of 6.3
million ha. (14.5% of the cultivated area). The increase in the areas
planted with crops such as wheat, rice and soybeans, which receive more
fertilizers than other crops,partly explains the increase in fertilizer
consumption experienced during the 1966-1976 period.

11.       The recommended fertilizer application rates, which are shown in
Table 4 and summarized below, show that most major crops, with the notable
exception of coffee, require more P nutrients than either N or K. Actual
fertilizer application rates are difficult to obtain since there is no
systematic collection of data on fertilizer use by crops or by year, and
only rough estimates can be made on the basis of fertilizer credit application
data. One estimate of actual fertilizer application rates for different
crops for 1974 is shown below. The recommended levels are low by inter-
national standards but are appropriate for the existing level of agricultural

technology. The actual application rates range from about 35% to 70% of
the recommended level except for corn and rice, which are much lower. The
six crops below account for almost 7% of the total fertilizer used in Brazil.

2/  This is the estimated average for 1971, 1973, and 1974. The 1971 and 1973
estimates were derived according to the distribution of fertilizer credits.
The 1974 data is an ANDA estimate.
3/ This is probably in the 10% to 20% range considering that the corn area
was 2.8 times the rice area in 1974 while rice accounted for 7% of
fertilizer consumption compared to 10% for corn.
12.       The differences between the recommended application rate and the
actual rate can be partly explained by (a) the inadequacy of complementary
inputs or technologies (plant varieties, cultivation method, correction of
soil acidity, etc.) and agricultural extension services; (b) the low level
of commercialization in several areaswith concomitant high transportation
costs for both agricultural inputs and outputs and lack of accessibility to
credit sources; (c) the general poverty of the small farmholders who are
mostly non-users of fertilizers; and most importantly (d) the decline in the
purchasing power of agricultural crops relative to fertilizer prices during
1974 as a result of the large increase in international fertilizer prices
(para 26).
13.       The cropping pattern also affects the seasonal or monthly usage of
fertilizers. About 70% of the fertilizer used for coffee, 60% of the
fertilizer used for soybeans and 50% of that used for sugarcane are applied
during the four months from July to October. Consequently, more than 50%
of the total fertilizer consumption is used during July to October and about
70% is used during the six months from May to October (Table 5). This
seasonal pattern of consumption is also reflected in the pattern of imports
with about 50% of total imports occurring during May to August.

14.       Of the Government policies affecting the use of fertilizers, the
policies for the agricultural credit system are particularly important.
The Government has been well aware of the importance of working
capital and liquidity for the modernization of agriculture; however, the
effectiveness of the programs instituted is somewhat debatable given the
relatively low overall efficiency of agricultural production and the lack
of sufficient statistical data and analysis. In 1965, the Government created
the National Rural Credit System (SNCR) which involved a complete revolution
in Brazil's rural credit system. SNCR is made up of the Central Bank (which
has a supervisory role in the system) and the Bank of Brazil, Bank of Amazonia,
Bank of the Northeast, and the National Credit Cooperative Bank. The National
Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA), the State official
banks, the National Savings Bank, the private banks, and the rural credit
cooperatives are linked informally to the SNCR. To coordinate, guide and
control the behavior of the different components of the credit system, a
special department was established in the Central Bank.
15.       The subsidy for the modernization of agriculture, specially the
consumption of fertilizer, began with the foundation of FUNFERTIL which
paid the total interest on loans used for buying fertilizer. In 1964 it
was substituted by FUNDAG which provided most credit at an annual interest
rate of 7% for buying modern inputs except for fertilizers where credit was
interest free until 1974. This accounts for the large (95%) share of
fertilizer purchases through the agricultural credit system. In addition
rural credit plays a major role in special development programs such
as the National Integration Program (PIN), the POLOAMAZONIA and POLONORDESTE.
The POLOCENTRO, PRODEPAN and GRANDE DOURADOS programs will be of special
importance for the development of fertilizer consumption in the western part of
the Center. With the introduction of the price subsidy, interest on fertilizer
credit was increased from 0% to 13 and 15% for medium/large and small farmers,
respectively. The average maturity for fertilizer credit is 7-10 months,
although it can be extended up to two years for crops like sugarcane and coffee,
which require a longer gestation period.
16.       Rural credit increased by a factor of seven from Cr$12.9 billion
to Cr$90 billion in current terms (a factor of 3 in real terms) between
1971 to 1975 (Table 6). The share of fertilizer credit to the total rural
credit gradually increased from 7.3% in 1971 to 8.3% in 1973. As a result of
the steep rise in fertilizer prices in 1974, the share of fertilizer credit
increased to 1h% of the total rural credit but declined slightly to 11.4%
in 1975 partly reflecting the drop in fertilizer prices and the slower growth
in consumption during that year. Regionwise, fertilizer credit has the
largest share in the Center followed by the South and the Northeast. It
should be noted that the Center region in Table 6 does not include the
State of Parana which is included in the South. The regional distribution of
fertilizer credit according to the definition of the fertilizer market and
marketing regions (where Parana is part of the Center) would have to be
adjusted therefore to be about 8%, 75% and 17% for the Northeast, Center
and South, respectively, while consumption of fertilizer is about 9%, 60%
and 31%. This would indicate that the South is making less use of fertilizer
credits than the Center. Lacking more specific data, it is difficult
to find an explanation for this.

(ii) Agricultural Productivity
17.       Until 1970, the growth in Brazil's agricultural output was mostly
accounted for by the expansion of the cultivated area. With the exception
of a few crops such as coffee, wheat and potatoes which registered remarkable
increases in yields, the productivity of most crops showed only slight
improvements from 1961/63 through 1968/70. During 1968/70-1973/74, cotton,
cacao and soybeans achieved gains in yields as shown below.  Over the
period 1961/63-1973/74, five of the major crops achieved average productivity
increases exceeding 2% annually.

l/  For estimating the annual increase in yield, the fl-year period, 1962/1973,
is used.
18.       Different levels of agricultural technology for the various crops
account for most of the difference in productivity gains or lack thereof.
Coffee, being the most important crop in terms of export earnings, has
probably the most advanced agricultural technology in terms of high-yielding
varieties, cultivation methods and fertilizer application. In addition, it
also has well-developed supporting services such as extension services,
credit facilities, and marketing system.  As a result, the 50% reduction



ANNEX 3-2
Page 9
in the area cultivated with coffee between 1960 and 1974 was offset by a
doubling of yields in the same period. The shift in the coffee areas away
from the frost-prone zone of the southern part of the Center region towards
the central part of the Central region with its more favorable weather
conditions should ensure more stable and better yields in the future.
19.       The level of agricultural technology and supporting services,
even for the same crop, varies among the different regions in Brazil. In
general, the most agriculturally developed region is the South, followed by
the Center with the North and Northeast regions the least developed. The
regional differences in productivity during 1973 is illustrated in Table 7.
The best productivity is in the South and Center regions while the lowest is
in the Northeast region. Thus, the regional distribution of the cultivated
area for a particular crop affects the overall productivity for that crop.
For example, practically all the wheat and the soybean areas are in the South
and Center regions. In contrast, about 96% of the sugarcane areas and
practically all the cotton areas are in the Center and the Northeast regions.
The gains in cotton productivity, however, mostly originate from the Center
region, which accounted for 60% of the 1973 cotton output but only 28% of
the cultivated area. Finally, most of the recently cultivated land is
in less developed areas with a low productivity, thereby depressing the
overall national yields for those crops introduced in the newly cultivated
land.
20.       An international comparison of agricultural productivity, as
shown below, indicates a large potential for improving agricultural productivity
in Brazil, even among those crops which have shown significant yield improve-
ments during the last 15 years.

21.       While Brazilian agriculture will continue to be extensive in
character as opposed to intensive agriculture as practiced in the Netherlands
or Japan, the Government's objective of a 2% to 3% annual increase in
agricultural productivity during 1975-1979 (Annex 3-1) appears reasonable.
Such improvements, however, will require a systematic and deliberate approach
to agricultural development considering that most of the newly cultivated
land will be located in less developed areas requiring the development of
transportation and marketing systems. Both the expansion of cultivated area
and the improvement in the level of agricultural technology imply a continued
growth in the demand for fertilizers.
22.       The extensive nature of Brazil's agriculture is further demonstrated
by low fertilizer application rates, when compared to other countries, as
shown below:

C.  Agricultural Input and Output Prices
23.       In pursuing its agricultural production and productivity objectives,
the Government has traditionally relied on two policy instruments: providing
credit to finance agricultural inputs (as discussed) and setting minimum
prices for agricultural outputs to guarantee a reasonable level of profit-
ability for agricultural production. The system of minimum prices for
agricultural output was started in 1945 and has since extended its coverage
from six major crops (rice, beans, corn, peanuts, sunflower and soybeans)
to almost all agricultural products and most products of animal origin. The
Consejo Interministerial de Precos (CIP) is responsible for operating the
minimum price system. The minimum price is generally announced 60 days
before the crop is planted and the Government guarantees the purchase of
the production at this price. Financing is also provided for about 180 to
216 days at 100% of the estimated value of the production based on the
minimum price. The geographical coverage of the system has expanded from
the export ports and large consumer centers to many intermediate points in the



ANNEX 3-2
Page 11
country thereby creating homogenous price zones.  From 1966 thr agh 1974,
farm prices of most agricultural products increased in real terms (Table 8).
24.       Up to 1974, the Government has not intervened in the determination
of fertilizer retail prices, allowing market forces to set prices.
Consequently, fertilizer prices have been affected by both international and
domestic economic trends as indicated below by the cyclical pattern of
prices (in constant terms) during the last 30 years.

the subsidy the index would be 209.
2/ Prices are expected to decline slightly (in real terms) during 1976
and 1977.
25.       The combination of real term increases in farm product and decreases
in fertilizer prices increased the purchasing power of agricultural products
relative to fertilizers as shown below:

26.       The purchasing power of agricultural crops relative to fertilizer
declined dramatically during 1974 as a consequence of the large increase in
international fertilizer prices. Concerned about the possible adverse effect
of the increase in fertilizer prices on fertilizer usage and agricultural
production, in 1975 the Government introduced a 40% subsidy towards the
purchase of fertilizer and a 15% interest rate on fertilizer credits which
had been interest free prior to 1975. The net effect, however, was favorable
and brought the purchasing power of most agricultural crops back to the
1972 level.  International fertilizer prices began to decline in the third
quarter of 1974, and by 1976 have settled back to the 1972/73 levels (Chart I).
As a result of the rapid decline in international fertilizer prices during
1975, the purchasing power of agricultural products in relation to fertilizers
increased again and therefore the Government eliminated the subsidy in late
December 1976. This however, is not expected to have any adverse effect on
fertilizer demand, since the relationship between agricultural product and
fertilizer prices is expected to remain favorable. The removal of the subsidy,
when it was not any longer economically justified, is an indication of the
attention the Government is paying to the fertilizer sector and of the
Government's determination to rol ow rational policies in this sector.
27.       To avoid abuses within the fertilizer price subsidy program and
to prevent the fertilizer industry from making excessive profits arising
from the preference position granted to the industry by the import quota
system for fertilizers (para 40), the Government in 1975 initiated a system
of maximum fertilizer prices at the retail level. The CIP computes the
maximum price per nutrient based on the proportion and expected cost of
imported and domestically produced fertilizers, and an allowance for blending
and distribution costs. The resulting price is then published as a ceiling
price and credit or subsidy is only given to fertilizers purchased at prices
equal or below the ceiling price. For the first half of 1976, the CIP
published the following maximum retail prices: US$640/ton of N, US$690/ton
of P205, and US$250/ton of K20 as derived below.

28.       The maximum retail prices, on a US$ equivalent basis, have
declined by 28% for N, 13% for P205 and 23% for K20 between 1975 and the
first half of 1976. For the second half of 1976, the CIP has increased the
maximum prices at a monthly rate of 1.5%, which is considerably lower than
the inflation rate of 2% to 4% per month expected for the same period.
This intended reduction in the maximum retail price level in real terms is
appropriate considering the downward trend in international prices from
1975 through 1976. As the maximum prices are conservatively estimated and
include a safety margin in the import, production and distribution costs,
it has been observed and can be expected to continue that, on the average,
actual prices because of competitive pressures at the retail level will
tend to be 15-20% lower than the stipulated maximum.
29.       The estimate for domestic production costs indicate that they are
about 52% higher for N and 39% higher for P205 compared to the cost of
imported fertilizers. Several factors could explain this difference.
Firstly, the domestic production facilities, particularly for N, are small
and do not enjoy the economies-of-scale common in the export oriented
plants of other countries. Secondly, the industry is based on imported raw
materials and intermediate products, particularly phosphate rock, sulfur,
phosphoric acid and ammonia whose international prices have not decreased in
the same proportion as the prices of finished products. Whiile this is a
short-term phenomena that is expected to change, the immediate effect is a
situation whereby the cost of importing the raw materials and intermediates
required for the production of some fertilizers into Brazil is higher than



ANNEX 3-2
Page 14
the cost of importing the finished product.  Finally, the domestic costs are
provided by the local firms and the cost data probably contain some upward
bias, to ensure higher profits or to incorporate anticipated cost increases
that may not be fully matched by increases in the stipulated maximum prices
in the future.
30.       The export of agricultural output continues to be the primary
source of foreign exchange for Brazil. The Government's economic objectives
especially the management of the country's precarious balance-of-payments
situation, depends heavily on the export performance of the agricultural
sector. Thus, there is within the Government increasing attention on
agricultural policies designed to increase agricultural exports. To enhance
Brazil's competitiveness in the agricultural export market, it is important
that agricultural inputs be provided at cost levels comparable to those
prevailing in other exporting countries. The introduction and abolishment
of the 40% subsidy for fertilizer is illustrative of the Government's increasingly
active role. In mid-1976, Brazilian fertilizer retail prices without the
subsidy are somewhat higher than those prevailing in the USA as shown below.

However, during the latter half of 1976, Brazilian fertilizer prices
further declined in real terms and in early 1977 they are estimated to be only
slightly above those prevailing in the USA. In the longer run, as the new
fertilizer production facilities come into operation, the average cost of
domestic production is expected to decline and come in line with the lower
international prices forecast for the end of this decade.
D. Fertilizer Consumption
(i) Historical Fertilizer Consumption Patterns
31.       Between 1959 and 1966, the year-to-year apparent consumption of
fertilizer fluctuated considerably, but did not show any underlying growth



ANNEX 3-2
Page 15
trend (Table 9, Chart II), reflecting in part the Government's neglect of
the agriculture and fertilizer sectors during that period. By the mid-
sixties, however, the improvements in the credit system, the favorable
economic climate, the continued expansion of the cultivated area, the shifts
in the cropping pattern, the improving relationship of agricultural product
to fertilizer prices and the increasing availability of high analysis
fertilizer products, provided the stimuli for increased fertilizer use.
During the six years from 1966 to 1972, fertilizer consumption increased at
an average annual   rate of 35%.  This rapid growth in fertilizer use is also
reflected in the marked improvement in the intensity of fertilizer use between
1966 and 1972 as shown below:

2/ From para 27.  The price index is in real terms with 1963 = 100.
For 1976, the index shown is for 1975 and is based on a 40% price
subsidy. Without the subsidy, the index would be 209. A slight
decrease in real prices is expected between 1975 and 1976.
The strong upward trend was only interrupted by adverse weather
in 1969 and 1973 and slowed down by the large increases in international
fertilizer prices during 1974 and 1975. The introduction of the fertilizer
retail price subsidy (paras 26 to 28) during 1975 helped apparent consumption
grow at a modest rate that year. The continuation of the subsidy system and
the continued decline in international prices have caused apparent consumption
to rise by 17% in 1976.
32.       The absence of systematic statistics on changes in the fertilizer
inventory levels makes it difficult to estimate actual year by year
consumption, which would probably show less annual fluctuations and a more
discernable trend compared to apparent consumption. The Ministry of
Agriculture has made an estimate of actual consumption for the last six
years which shwws a more stable growth as shown below:

33.       Phosphate is the most important nutrient consumed because of the
soil characteristics and cropping pattern in Brazil (paras 9 to 12). This
has led to the NPK consumption ratio of about 1:2.3:1.3 for the 1972-1976
period. As can be expected, there is a marked difference in the NPK
consumption ratio between the South, the Center and the North/Northeast
regions (Table 10, Chart III) as summarized below. The highest ratio of P
to N is in the South, where most of the soybean and wheat areas are located.

34.       Fertilizer consumption has increased most rapidly in the South,
at about 34.4% annually over the last 10 years (Table 1l), followed by the
Northeast (22.4%) and the Center (19.7%). The higher growth rate in the
Northeast compared to the Center reflects the relatively lower consumption
levels in the Northeast during the mid-sixties. Although the South is
the most intensive user of fertilizer, the Center, with its larger cultivated
area, accounts for almost 60% of total nutrient consumption over 1972-76
(Table 12) followed by the South (31%) and the North/Northeast (9%).
35.       Although a significant shift towards higher analysis fertilizer
products occurred in the late sixties, only the phosphatic fertilizers
continued the trend between 1970 and 1974, with TSP displacing SSP
(Table 13). The limited domestic production capacity for urea is partly
responsible for the continued dominance of low analysis products in the
nitrogen fertilizer area.

(ii) Fertilizer Demand Forecast
36.       In 1972, the Government commissioned a study of the fertilizer
sector. The study was executed by SEITEC under the joint supervision of
BNDE (The National Development Bank), IPEA (a planning institute in the
Ministry of Planning) and ANDA.  The report, published in May 1974 on the
basis of actual data up to 1970, estimated fertilizer demand at about 4.0
million nutrient tons by 1980 equivalent to an application rate of 80 kg of
nutrient/ha. compared to about 52 Kg/ha. during 1976. The demand forecast
formed the basis for the Government's National Fertilizer Plan (NFP) of
early 1975.
37.       The upper limit for the potential demand for fertilizer can be
estimated on the basis of normative analysis of necessary nutrient replace-
ment rates, and projections of both increases in cultivated area and cropp-
ing patterns. This approach results in a potential demand estimate of about
12 million nutrient tons in 1985. Given the 1976 consumption of 2.3
million nutrient tons, an upper bound of 23% annual average growth rate
from 1976 to 1985 can thus be established. On the basis of the trends of
the past ten years, the Government's agricultural programs for achieving
its goal of an increase of about 7% annually for agricultural output
(Annex 3-1) during the Second Development Flan period (1975-1979), and
the increasing availability of more economically produced local fertilizers,
demand growth rates ranging from 10% to 15% annually appear likely, which
would be somewhat lower than the actual rates for 1970-76 (para 34). Higher
growth rates could probably not be sustained because constraints such as a
slower development of complementary agricultural technology, and limitations
in the extension services, credit facilities and the transportation and
marketing systems would be much too difficult to overcome. The Bank's
forecast on the basis of a 10% to 11% annual NPK demand growth rate is
shown below, together with the forecast contained in the NFP. The NFP
forecasts the NPK ratio to shift significantly to about 1.0:1.14:0.7 by
1980, since generally, at more intensive levels of fertilizer use, pro-
portionately more N is required compared to P. However, because of the
planned increase in newly cultivated area, which require considerably more
P than N; and the evolving cropping pattern showing several major crops
such as soybeans and wheat which also require more P than N, it is very
likely that only a modest shift in the NPK ratio will materialize.

E. Fertilizer 54pply - Imports and Production
(i) Historical Pattern of Fertilizer Supply
39.       Brazil imports a major portion of its N and P and all of its K
nutrient requirements in the form of raw materials (phosphate rock), inter-
mediates (phosphoric acid and azrnnonia) and finished products as mentioned in
para 3.  From 1960-1965, total nutrient imports accounted for 55% to 65% of
apparent consumption. From 1966 to 1975, the share of imports has increased
to about 65% to 80% (Table 14) reflecting the low natural resource endowment
of the country. Nonetheless, an increasing proportion of imports represented
raw materials and intermediates, especially for P, rather than finished
products. This reliance on imported fertilizer materials has proved expensive
when international fertilizer prices increased threefold between 1973 and 1974
(Chart I). The fertilizer import bill for 1974 and 1975 were about US$500
million compared to US$169 million in 1973.
40.       The reliance on imports of finished as well as intermediate products
prior to 1973 has helped maintain retail fertilizer prices at reasonable
levels, since local production costs were generally much higher than the
costs of imports (para 29). To protect local producers and ensure that all
local production is consumed, the Govermnent has instituted an import quota
system for finished fertilizer products. The system requires retailers to
purchase a given proportion of local production for each unit of imported
fertilizer product. The ratio changes depending on local availability and
consumption expectations. When international prices are exceptionally high
as in 1974 and 1975, imports are not restricted. But under more normal inter-
national price conditions, when local production costs exceed the cost of
imports, the quota system is implemented. For 1976, the quota in the North-
east was 1:1 (1 ton of imports per ton of local purchases) for N and P205
could be imported without limit. In the South and the Center the 1976 quota
was 1.6:1 for N (1.6 tons of import per ton of local production) and about
0.4:1 for P205.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 19
41.       Imports are seasonal (Table 15), reflecting the seasonal structure
of consumption (para 13) and has allowed Brazilian blenders, mixers and
distributors to minimize their inventory costs by timing deliveries just
slightly ahead of the fertilizer season. The blending and mixing production
levels are easily changed from one or two work shifts during the slack
season and three to four work shifts during the peak season, thereby also
minimizing working capital requirements. About 80% of imports are processed
through two ports, Santos (60%) and Rio Grande (20%), reflecting the
concentration of consumption in the States of Sao Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul.
42.       The historical production of N and P fertilizers are shown in
Table 16. Significant increases in production occurred only
after1l968/69 when the QUIMBRASIL phosphate project started production with
a phosphoric acid capacity of 65,000 TPY of P205 and a total phosphate product
capacity of 100,000 TPY of P205. During 1970/71, the ULTRAFERTIL plant
(123,000 TPY of N, 65,000 TPY of P205) at Sao Paulo and the PETROFERTIL plant
(55,000 TPY of N) in Bahia came on stream. The COPEBRAS phosphate project
started production in late 1975 with a phosphoric acid capacity of 90,000
TPY of P205 and a total phosphate product capacity of 145,000 TPY of P205.
The PETROFERTIL ammonia/urea expansion project (247,000 TPY of) is scheduled
for completion in mid-1977 and will double Brazil's ammonia capacity from
230,000 TPY of N to 477,000 TPY N.
During 1973-75, the local N production accounted for about 35%
of N consumption while the domestic P production accounted for about 45%
of P consumption. However, since all K nutrients are imported, the total
nutrient (NPK) production just represented some 30% of total NPK consumption.
(ii) Production Forecast
43.       As discussed (para 3), the Government, through the NFP, is supporting a
number of projects which will transform the fertilizer industry into a major
industrial sector in Brazil's economy. One fuel-oil-based ammonia/urea
project (325,000 TPY N) is under construction at Araucaria, Parana, with a
Bank financing of US$50 million (Loan No. 1256 BR). Two other ammonia/urea
projects, both gas-based, are in an advanced stage of planning. The most
advanced is in Sergipe in the Northeast (247,000 TPY N) which is being pro-
posed for Bank financing. The other is at Norte Fluminense, Rio de
Janeiro (247,000 TPY N) which replaced the Paulinea project after the dis-
covery of offshore oil and gas near Campos. The Norte Fluminense project is
being proposed for financing by the Inter American Development Bank. The
three projects are expected to start commercial operation in 1979 and 1981,
respectively, and will be owned by FERTILIZANTES with a combined financing
requirement of about US$800 to 850 million. Since ULTRAFERTIL, PETROFERTIL
and FAFER will also be subsidiaries of FERTILIZANTES to consolidate all
fertilizer enterprises of PETROBRAS, FERTILIZANTES will hold the monopoly
of the ammonia/urea production capacity in the country. A fourth ammonia/
urea project probably based on fuel oil to be located in the South (Rio Grande
do Sul) is in the initial stages of planning by FERTILIZANTES and the State
Government, but is not expected to come into production until 1982/83.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 20
44.       Table 17 shows the development of the ammonia capacity and
production rom 1976 through 1985, indicating an almost sixfold increase in
capacity between 1976 and 1981. During 1976 through 1979, about 75% to 80%
of the ammonia production will be available for fertilizer use, the balance
will be needed for industrial uses. By 1980 and 1981, however, when the
Sergipe and Norte Fluminense projects start operation, about 85% to 90% of
the total ammonia production will be available for fertilizer use.
45.       The phosphate rock production capacity of Brazil is also expected
to increase about six times from about 130,000 TPY P205 in 1976 to about
875,000 TPY of P205 by 1979 (Table 18) with the operation of three mining/
beneficiation projects at Araxa the ARAFERTIL project - 225,000 TPY P205)
in mid-1977, at Tapira (the VALEP project - 345,000 TPY P20 ) in late-1978
and at Ipanema (the QUIMBRASIIVSERRANA project - 105,000 TP  P205).  The
Ipanema rock and the output from pilot plants at Patos and Catalao (METAGO),
which will start production in 1977, will all be used for direct application.
Between 1980 and 1985, three additional mining/beneficiation projects, now
under initial planning, are expected to be operational. These are the Patos
de Minas project of FERTILIZANTES (350,000 TPY of P205) expected to start
operation in 1981 at the earliest; the Catalao project of METAGO (220,000
TPY P205) and another project at Catalao by Mineracao Catalao (200,000 TPY
of P205). The two projects at Catalao in the state of Goias are private
sector ventures and will probably come into operation about two to three
years apart, starting 1983 because of transportation difficulties, financing
constraints, and inadequate market demand before 1984. The financing
requirements of a large mining/beneficiation project based on low grade rock
can range from US$150 to US$200 million.
46.       Several phosphate fertilizer projects are also in the planning
stage (para 6). The most advanced is the VALEFERTIL project at Uberaba
with a phosphoric acid capacity of 290,000 TPY of P205 and a total phosphate
product capacity of 333,000 TPY of P205, expected to be completed by mid-1979.
The VALEFERTIL project will use the phosphate rock from the VALEP project. A
Bank loan has been requested for the VALEFERT1IL project. A second project,
by ARAFERTIL, will be located at Araxa to use the Araxa phosphate rock. The
ARAFERTIL project will have a phosphoric acid capacity of 190,000 TPY P205
and a total phosphate product capacity of 220,000 TPY of P205.  While the
project has been ready for implementation for sometime, financing constraints
have delayed construction and the project is now expected to be completed by
1981. In the meantime, the Araxa rock will be sold to producers in the
State of Sao Paulo. Two projects are proposed to be constructed in the South,
with a combined phosphoric acid capacity of 285,000 TPY of P205 and a total
product capacity of about 330,000 TPY of P205, or about the size of the
VALEFERTIL project. These two projects will be owned by LUCHsINGER and by
ICC and will likely be completed in 1980. They will both use imported
phosphate rock because no phosphate deposit has been discovered in the South.
Table 19 contains the forecast of phosphoric acid capacity and production,
while Table 20 shows the forecast of total phosphate fertilizer nutrient
output.

F. Forecast of Fertilizer Demand and Supply Situation
47.       The regional as well as national forecast of fertilizer demand and
supply is given in Table 21 for N and Table 22 for P205. All K20 is expected
to be supplied from imports. The forecasts are summarized below and indicate
that with the three new ammonia/urea projects Brazil will be increasingly
self-sufficient in N with local production accounting for 33% of consumption
in 1975 and reaching full self-sufficiency in 1981. The Northeast will have
a surplus of N fertilizers which will be shipped to the Center which will
continue to be a net importer of N. If demand should continue to grow at
10% annually, a new N fertilizer project will be needed to come into
production every two years starting in 1983 to keep local production close
to the demand levels. Thus, the ammonia/urea project in the South can be
planned for completion by 1983.

48.       The supply and demand forecast for P indicates that the South will
continue to be a deficit region, inspite of the planned doubling of capacity
from 328,000 TPY of P205 in 1976 to about 643,000 TPY of P205 by 1980. The
deficit could be eliminated by adding another 130,000 TPY of P2C5 product
capacity for 1980/81, and then increasing capacity by about 150,000 TPY of
P205 every other year thereafter. The South will also be importing all its
phosphoric acid and phosphate rock until 1980 when LUCHSINGER and ICC
complete their phosphoric acid projects. By 1981, the South would still be
only about 50% self-sufficient in phosphoric acid requirement, and will still
import all its rock requirement. While a potential surplus of phosphate
rock (from Catalao) exist in the Center region for 1982-1984, the prohibitive
local transport cost makes shipment into the South uneconomic except when
international prices increase much higher than presently estimated.
49.       The phosphate product supply and demand  situation in the Center
region will change, however, from a deficit situation up to 1978, to a
balanced situation in 1979, and then to a potential surplus situation



ANNEX 3-2
Page 22
during 1980 and 1983. The potential surplus is about 100,000 to 150,000 TPY
of P205 and exists only because four firms (UNIAO, FERTIBASE, MANAH and
INDAG) have the flexibility of producing some TSP, based on imported
phosphoric acid, or SSP, based on imported sulfuric acid or sulfur. If
these four firms produce the maximum TSP, they will supply 50% more P205
nutrients than if they produced only SSP.11 The four firms could produce
the maximum P205 nutrients (TSP) and ship part of their production to the
South, which is expected to have a deficit of about 100,000 to 150,000 TPY
of P205 between 1980 and 1983 and a much larger deficit after 1983. But
these four producers may not be competitive with imports into the South.
The production forecast for phosphate products in Table 21 assume that
during 1980 through 1983, these four firms will adjust their product mix
between SSP and TSP such that a surplus of P205 nutrients in the Center
region is avoided. This assumption is reasonable since the VALEFERTIL
and the ARAFERTIL projects, which come on-stream during 1979 and 1981,
respectively, will supply the necessary TSP and MAP based on their own
phosphoric acid production. By 1984, however, this potential surplus will
disappear and a deficit will occur again by 1985. It appears, therefore,
that the Center region will not need additional phosphate product capacity,
other than the VALEFERTIL and the ARAFERTIL projects, until 1984. Starting
1985 or 1986, additional capacity of about 100,000 TPY of P205 will be
required each year to keep production in line with increases in demand.
50.       The North/Northeast region will have a deficit of phosphate
products up to 1979, when the proposed PROFERTIL TSP project and the
AGROFERTIL MAP project are expected to be completed. Beyond 1979, the region
should be self-sufficient in P205 products, although it will import all the
phosphoric acid and phosphate rock raw materials.
51.       A summary of the phosphate product demand and supply situation is
given below:

52.       The Center region is expected to be self-sufficient in phosphoric
acid between 1980 and 1983 with the VALEFERTIL and the ARAFERTIL projects.
In addition, the region will also be about 85% to 95% self-sufficient in
phosphate rock with the completion of the four projects at Araxa, Tapira,
Ipanema and Patos de Minas (Table 18). The present plans for the Patos
deposit envisions a mining/beneficiation project (310,000 TPY P205) to be
completed perhaps by 1981 to substitute for imported phosphate rock. At
that time, the ARAFERTIL fertilizer project will likely come on stream and
use the Araxa phosphate rock. Thus, the Patos project will continue to
supply rock to the present producers, notably COPEBRAS and ULTRAFERTIL. An
expansion project for Patos, probably to be ready by 1985 or 1986, will
involve a doubling of the mining output for processing into phosphatic
fertilizers. This expansion project will be identical in scale to the combined
VALEP-VALEFERTIL complex and will provide the additional phosphoric acid
capacity needed in the region. Development of one of the Catalao deposit for
production by 1983 and the second Catalao project for operation by 1986 would
ensure the Center region self-sufficiency in phosphate rock through the end
of the 1980s.
G. Distribution System
53.       The structure of the Brazilian marketing and distribution system
is schematically shown in Chart IV. Most of the fertilizer passes through
three levels on the way to final consumption:  (i) primary production,
(ii) blenders and (iii) wholesale and retail sales organization. In
addition, domestic producers, who supply about one-third of consumption, are
also usually involved in importing as well as blending and seIling.  About
90% of total consumption is processed through blenders, which are either
owned by manufacturers (25% of total), independent companies (65%), or
cooperatives (10%). Blenders are also involved in importing.
54.       Sales organizations are either:  (i) dependent organizations of
the manufacturers,  (ii) commission agents, (iii) independent dealers
and (iv) cooperatives. Dependent organizations are extensions of the
manufacturer's marketing organization and employees work on a fixed salary.
Commission agents depend on the blending operation or the domestic
manufacturers by an agreement which obliges them to sell only fertilizer
products of the corresponding companies. The local agents who sell on a
commission basis can be exclusive fertilizer dealers or general rural
salesmen. Companies which sell by commission agents employ one regional
sales manager and 4-6 inspectors for every 50-150 local agents. The regional
sales manager is a salaried employee of the company, the inspectors may or
may not receive fixed salaries. Local agents receive a commission of about
4% from the sales as an average ranging from 3 to 10%. The agent helps the
farmer in arranging bank credits and transportation.
55.       Independent dealers have lost importance and this trend is continu-
ing. At present they are primarily used in new areas in which the amount of
fertilizer sold at the introductory phase does not pay a company-owned
selling system.  Similarly, cooperatives are not a major sales outlet, and
are not expected to grow significantly in the near future. Sales on commission
is still the most frequently used marketing channel. However, the exact



ANNEX 3-2
Page 24
distribution on the different market channels is not known, and the percentage
numbers given in Chart IV are only rough estimates.
56.       The distribution of storage between manufacturers, blenders and
local retailers is not accurately known. Blenders try to avoid storage as
far as possible because of the lack of working capital. Considering the cost
of storage it is usually more profitable for them to adjust their blending
operation to the seasonal structure of consumption by increasing the daily
working time from 8 to 24 hours, than to store large quantitites over 9
months of the year. Farmers participate only marginally in storage also due
primarily to lack of working capital and insufficient discount and credit
facilities.  Thus, most of storage is done by the manufacturers, who usually
rent storage in the peak season. The problem of storage will become more
serious with increasing degree of local production, since adjustment by
imports will lose its present importance.
57.       Transportation is one of the most important distribution elements
in Brazil because of the long distance between production and consumption
centers. It is also a significant constraint to the growth of fertilizer
consumption especially in the regions which will become crucial for the
further increase of agricultural production. The Government (GEIPOT) has embarked
in 1975 on a country-wide transportation study and has completed Phase I which
studied the present and expected transportation pattern of ten commodities
which constitute the bulk of Brazil's transportation requirements. One of
the commodities studied was fertilizer, and the following is an extract from
the Phase I report.
58.       In principle, highway transportation, railway transportation and
coastal shipping compete against each other. But transport by ship along
the coast or on the great rivers has not gained importance in domestic
transportation. Road and rail transport are, therefore, the only significant
means of transportation,and the split for the two modes is shown below for
1974:
BRAZIL - TRANSPORT MODES OF FERTILIZER, 1974
(in %)
Region            Product         By Road  By Rail  Total
Northeast  Finished Products         96.9      3.1    100.0
Center     Raw Materials             95.9      4.1    100.0
Intermediate Products   88.0      12.0    100.0
Finished Products        84.8      15.2    100.0
South      Finished Products         81.7     18.3    100.0
Source: GEIPOT
59.       Most fertilizers are thus moved by road transport despite the fact
that rail transport may be cheaper in many cases. The principal reason for
this pattern is the greater flexibility and convenience provided by road



ANNEX 3-2
Page 25
transport particularly for the distribution of finished fertilizer. Para-
doxically, the share of rail transport in the Center is larger for finished
products than for raw materials (15.2% versus 4.1%). This is due to the
lack of a railway link between the fertilizer terminal in Santos and the
railway network of the Center. All raw materials entering the port of Santos
have to be loaded on trucks before they can be moved by railway. A rail link
is being built and financed under the Bank's First Port Project. The share of
fertilizer raw materials carried by the railways in the Center can be expected
to increase once the line is completed.
60.       The lack of specialized freight cars for corrosive bulk materials
and the fact that many manufacturers and blenders do not have adequate
facilities for loading and unloading bulk materials from railcars is one of the
most important handicaps which have prevented the railways from capturing a
larger share of the transport of raw and intermediate materials. Manufacturers
generally have to bag intermediate products in order to use the railway's
standard box cars. The blender receiving the material has to tear the bags
as an additional operation before he can use the material. Unless the
distances are very long, the additional cost of bagging and unbagging normally
offsets the cost advantage of the railways, thus road transport, which is also
generally faster, is used.
61.       The industry would use the railway for transport of bulk materials
but for the lack of proper railcars. To overcome this situation, it would be
necessary to identify those transport routes which carry a considerable
amount of bulk materials and to convert such routes to rail transport by
working out an agreement between the companies involved and the railroad
authority. The necessary analytical work for this is being done as part of
the Fertilizer Market and Marketing Study (para 70).
62.       The GEIPOT study also evaluated the port situation which is impor-
tant to the fertilizer industry as over 50% of all the nutrients still come
from overseas. In terms of importance, the ports of Santos and Rio Grande
rank first and second and they handle about 80% of imported fertilizer
materials. The table below gives a breakdown of the volumes handled by
each port for 1974 and also an estimate of the fertilizer unloading capacity
for some of the ports:

63.       Rio Grande is the best equipped port with special fertilizer handling
equipment and storage installed by FERTISUL and by LUCHSINGER. Santos also
has a special fertilizer terminal with a nominal capacity of unloading 12,000
tons per day per ship. The actual unloading however, reaches only about
1,800 tons per day per ship because of the design of the berths, the low capa-
city of the grabs, and the tendency of the fertilizer to cake. The other
difficulty in Santos is the lack of a railway link as mentioned earlier. The
ports in the Northeast are much more inefficient, and Recife, which handles
more than 50% of the imports for the Northeast will require a fertilizer
terminal to cope with the larger volume expected in the future.
64.       The new chemical port being built in Aratu (Bahia) to move the raw
materials and finished products of the chemical complex in Camacari (which
includes the PETROFERTIL plant) will have excellent fertilizer handling
facilities. The excess fertilizer production of the Northeast can thus be
very efficiently shipped from Aratu.
65.       Port handling charges average about US$20 per ton depending on the
port and the material handled. Costs in Rio Grande and the new port of Aratu
are and will continue to be much lower than in other ports.
66.       Table 23 gives a comparison of some representative routes and costs
for rail and road transport in the Center and the South. It shows that while
the railroads charge less than the trucking companies on a per ton-km basis,
this advantage, particularly for distances less than 600 road km, is offset
by the fact that the trains have to cover a much greater distance
between any two given points compared to highway travel. There appears to



ANNEX 3-2
Page 27
be an interesting regional difference between the Center and the South. The
South's rail tariffs are considerably lower, while road transport charges
appear higher, than the Center's. As a result, rail transport in the South
is generally cheaper than by truck, while the Center shows a slight advantage
for road transport. This probably explains why rail transport has a higher
share of fertilizer shipments in the South than any other region.
67.       The future transportation pattern will be significantly altered by
the expected growth of the fertilizer sector and by the shift from imports to
local production of raw and intermediate materials. This will generally ease
the load on the ports, but will increase the inland transport requirements
significantly.  Starting in 1977 when PETROFERTIL's new ammonia/urea plant
will commence production, large quantities of ammonia will have to be moved
over long distances. At present, only small amounts of ammonia are moved, all
by truck. The companies and the railroads have to make a considerable invest-
ment in ammonia moving facilities. PETROBRAS is presently studying this
problem and specific recommendations are expected by early 1977.
68.       Because the Northeast will become a net exporter of nitrogen
fertilizers, coastal shipping will become a more important mode of transport
to move ammonia and urea. It is also possible that the production from the
proposed plant at Norte Fluminense would best be moved by ship, further
increasing the role of coastal shipping in the fertilizer sector.
H. Proposed Fertilizer Market and Marketing Study
69.       In connection with the Araucaria project, the Government has under-
taken a study of the market and marketing aspects of the fertilizer sector.
While the Government intends that the private sector handle the marketing and
distribution of fertilizers, as has been the case in the past, it is crucial
that the Government help identify potential bottlenecks in marketing and
distribution, to ensure that the Government's policies and programs comple-
ment to the fullest degree, and facilitate, the rapid expansion of fertilizer
use. The Government has also agreed to exchange views with the Bank regarding
the expansion and development of the fertilizer sector including fertilizer
import and pricing policy, and the results and recommendations of the
proposed study.
70.       The proposed study would have the following major objectives:
(i)    Develop a methodology for and estimate fertilizer demand
and supply for a 10-year period and propose institutional
arrangements for annual updates;
(ii)   Make recommendations as to the optimal location of future
fertilizer plants considering regional increase in
consumption and likely shifts in fertilizer distribution
patterns;



ANNEX 3-2
Page 28
(iii) Identify specific constraints that may prevent the more
efficient and broader use of fertilizers;
(iv)   Define improvements and/or expansion of storage, transporta-
tion and mixing/blending facilities that are required to
support the expected increases in fertilizer production/
consumption; and
(v)    Recommend possible new Government policies (including
credit and pricing) and programs that would be needed
to ensure that the required marketing/distribution
investments are undertaken either by the private or public
sectors, and encourage broader and more efficient fertilizer
use.
71.       Detailed terms of reference for the study were prepared by IPEA,
which will supervise the study, and have been reviewed by the Bank.  It is
expected that the final report of the study which began in October 1976
should be available in the fall of 1977.

BRAZIL - SERGIPE FERTILIZER PROJECT
FERTILIZER MARKEr AND MARKETING IN THE NORTHEAST
A. Fertilizer Use and Agriculture in the Northeast
With a population of about 30 million inhabitants and an average
per capita income of less than US$200, the Northeast of Brazil contains the
largest concentration of poverty in Latin America. Almost 60% of the
population lives in rural areas. Agricultural yields in the region are
generally low as the facts of poor ecological conditions--semiarid weather
and scarcity of fertile lands--are compounded by problems emerging from
concentration of land ownership and associated sharecropping and renting
arrangements. Important bottlenecks to agricultural development, such as
inadequate research, insufficient technical assistance, poorly developed
marketing channels, primitive production techniques, uneconomic allocation
of credit, insufficient economic and social infrastructure and weak public
institutions have persisted despite considerable concern and efforts to
alleviate them.
The Bank in its report, "Raral Development Issues and Options in
Northeast Brazil" (June 1975), has analyzed the agricultural sector of
the Northeast in detail. The Bank is also conducting an extensive
agricultural sector survey together with SUDENE, and some results of this
are now available. No attempt is made here to summarize the findings
of these and other reports dealing with the Northeast. Instead, this
discussion concentrates on the state of agriculture only insofar as the
past and future consumption of fertilizer is affected.
Fertilizer consumption in the Northeast is concentrated geographi-
cally by being nearly exclusively restricted to the coastal "Zona de Mata" and
the "Agreste," the transition zone between the humid coast and the arid center
(Map IBRD 12412).
This geographical concentration of fertilizer use is basically ex-
plained by the fact that mainly the Zona de Mata along the coast and in a
more limited way the Agreste has the climate and the soils which lend
themselves to the successful use of fertilizers. The remaining area with the
exception of some fertile, relatively high rainfall pockets has a semiarid
or arid climate with a high incidence of droughts. To use fertilizers in
these areas has a high element of risk, and it has been shown that for most
crops the farmer is better off using the traditional farming methods, which
do not use fertilizer, and have correspondingly low yields. It appears that
a considerable amount of research is required to develop technological
packages particularly suited to these areas of the Northeast. Undoubtedly,
these packages will have to include intensive use of irrigation which so far
is very little used in the Northeast. One area where irrigation is used
successfully and where agricultural production and fertilizer use has

Page 2
increased quite significantly over the last years is along the San Francisco
river valley where mostly vegetables, particularly onicns, are grown.
From the Bank - SUDENE farm survey of 1973, some more specific
insights can be obtained about the geographical distribution of fertilizer
users. In terms of the percentage of farms using fertilizer, the following
breakdown can be derived by physiographic area:
PERCENTAGE OF FARMS USING FERTILIZER, 1973
Zone           ZorAe Description              %
A            Frontier Maranhao             o.64
B            Middle Maranhao               0.02
C            Sertao                        1.34
D            Southeast Bahia               9.00
E            Zona de Mata (excl.Babia)  14.40
F            Zonade Mata (Bahia)& Cacao  34.30
Area
G            Agreste                       9.95
From this it can be observed that the level of adoption of fertilizer use is
generally low and does even in the Zona de Mata not exceed 35%. As could be
expected, adoption levels are highest at the coast and rapidly decrease for
the interior. Farms in the Sertao and the interior of Maranhao practically
do not use any fertilizer at all.
From the available statistics, it can be seen that adoption of
using fertilizer is best correlated to (i) the value of land; (ii) the density
of landless labor; (iii) the capital endowment and size of family farms; and
(iv) the price of fertilizers. Of these variables, the value of land and
the price of fertilizer were found to be by far the most important ones.
Since the value of land in turn is highly correlated to population density,
adoption of use of fertilizer is therefore largely a function of the popula-
tion pressure and fertilizer prices.
For the geographical distribution of fertilizer consumption, the
following table can be obtained:
ESTIMATED FERTILIZER CONSUMPTION BY ZONE
Zone          Zone Description          % of Total Consumption
A & B    Frontier & Middle Maranhao               -
C      Sertao                                   2%

ANNEX 3-3
Page 3
As indicated by the range in the percentages, there is considerable
uncertainty about the consumption breakdown for zones E, F and G. But even
with this uncertainty, a share of fertilizer consumption of 25% or more for
the Agreste indicates that diffusion of fertilizer use is taking place at a
rate greater than what is generally believed. From the evidence available,
it appears that fertilizer use is not any longer restricted to the coastal
strip of the Zona de Mata, but that its use is spreading into the Agreste.
With respect to the cropwise use of fertilizer, a similar diffusion
process can be observed. During the 1960s, surveys showed that about 85%
of all the fertilizer was used for sugarcane. From the Bank - SUDENE
survey of 1973, it appears that only about 50% is used for sugar with other
crops receiving more and more of the fertilizer as shown below:

Although sugarcane has become less important a fertilizer user
than before, it still is the only crop using significant application rates
with an average rate of about 160 kg/ha, which compares to a recommendation
of 250-300 kg/ha. Because of the importance of sugar to the fertilizer
sector in the Northeast, a brief description of the history and future
potential for sugarcane production is given below.
Sugarcane has been grown in the Northeast for over 400 years.
The industry was started in 1532; and in less than a century, the region
became one of the major sugar producing areas in the world. With the
recent decline in Cuban production, Brazil is now the largest producer
of sugar in the world; and Brazilian sugar exports in 197!  surpassed coffee
as Brazil's principal foreign exchange earner. Although sugarcane production
was originally restricted to the Northeast, the Center region, in particular



ANNEX 3-3
Page 4
the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, gained more and more importance.
By 1940 already 45% of total sugar production came from the center, and its
share further increased to about 65-75% at present. The main advantages of
the Center are the better soils, a more favorable topography and a well-
established economic and social infrastructure. As a result, production
costs in the Northeast are higher than those in the Center; and the
Government has established a gradually declining subsidy program to be
eliminated over a six-year period to compensate for this.
As can be seen from Table 1, more and more of the sugarcane
production has been used for production of sugar. For the next few years
it is expected that about 75-80% of the sugarcane production would be used
for sugar, 10-15% as animal feed and 10% for other uses, particularly for
alcohol production.
Increases in production have come mainly from an increase in
area. Agricultural and industrial yields in the Northeast and Center
have more or less stagnated with around 45 tons/ha as the average agricultural
yield. This is low in comparison to other regions in the world of which some
show yields of 150 tons/ha and higher. One of the main reasons for the low
and stagnating yields besides the limited fertility of the soils and the
unfavorable topography is the lack of higher yielding varieties in the
Northeast. Although, as mentioned above, sugarcane has been in the area for
four hundred years, serious development effort for higher yielding varieties
started only in 1970. Since it takes between six-eight years to develop
new varieties to the level of commercialization, this effort will only start
to pay off in the late seventies.
Agricultural practices in the Northeast in sugarcane farming
vary considerably. Generally, the large mill owners, representing about h0%
of the production of cane, use more advanced farming methods than the
smaller, independent farmers.  Much of the soil preparation is done manually
making use of relatively cheap labor.  About 25-30% of the sugarcane growing
area is on steep hills with a gradient of 20% or more where heavy soil
preparation equipment cannot be used.  With labor becoming more expensive,
it is necessary to use these lands for pasture or reforest them and con-
centrate the sugarcane production in those areas that are more favorable to
mechanized farming methods.
In 1933 the Government created the Institute of Sugar and Alcohol
(IAA) as an independent federal body that is charged with regulating the
supply of sugar to the domestic and export markets in order to avoid wide
fluctuations in the production of sugar. The IAA determines the production
of sugar for each season, specifies by state how much is to be made available
to the local and how much to the export market. Minimum prices for sugarcane
as well as raw and crystal sugar are set, and the IAA purchases all exportable
surplus and is responsible for its marketing. The main export market has
traditionally been the USA with a market share of up to 50%. Recently, the
USSR and Mainland China have purchased significant amounts totaling 25% of
Brazil's exportable sugar surplus.



ANNEX 3-3
Page 5
With a domestic demand growth of 4-5% annually and a promising
outlook for the export market, the prospects for increased sugar production
in Brazil are good. With its more favorable position, the Center will
continue to supply the major share of Brazil's production, but the Northeast
should be able to hold its share by increasing sugarcane planting on the
topographically more favorable areas by phasing out sugarcane production on
steep hills and by improving productivity through increased use of mechanized
equipment, new higher yielding varieties and modern inputs, particularly for
ratoon crops which appear to be neglected at present.
C. Past Fertilizer Consumption and Future Demand
Apparent fertilizer consumption data for the period 1966-1976
is given in Annex 3-2, Table 4, and shows a nearly eightfold increase
equivalent to an average annual growth of about 22% during that period. As in
the other regions, apparent fertilizer consumption has fluctuated widely and
no data is available for estimated real consumption. This very rapid growth
is contrasted by a slow growth for sugarcane production which increased by
only about 25% during the same period which is equivalent to an average annual
growth of only about 2.1%. Although fertilization of sugarcane has significant-
ly increased over the past ten years, the high growth rates for fertilizer
consumption can only be explained by the geographical and cropwise diffusion
process described earlier. However, without a year-by-year history of
fertilizer consumption by region and crop, no detailed analysis and explanation
for the rapid growth is possible.
The relationship between realized sugarcane prices and the cost of
fertilization has, as in the case of other crops, deteriorated with increased
world fertilizer prices during the 1973-75 period, but improved very
significantly in 1976. The table below shows the amount of cane that could
purchase the fertilizer required for one ha using a formula of 50-150-100
kg/ha:
PURCHASING POWER OF SUGARCANE
1972     1973      1974     1975      1976
Tons of Sugarcane
Required for Purchase of   8.5    1l.6        20.4      17.2      5.1
300 kg of Fertilizer
The figure for 1976 takes the 40% price subsidy into account. However, even
without the subsidy the cane requirement would be about back to the 1972 levels.
Considering that the cost of fertilizers should be not more than about 20% of
the value of the crop, equivalent to about 12 tons of cane, the present ratio
is conducive to stimulating the use of fertilizer for sugarcane.



ANNEX 3-3
Page 6
Four years ago, the Government had contracted ANDA to embark on a
three-year program of determining the bottlenecks preventing increased use of
fertilizer consumption and of conducting a large number of tests for fertilizer
use in the various states and for all the major crops cultivated in the North-
east. The results of this program, which was actively supported by FAO and
which is likely to be continued, are now available and are very encouraging.
As bottlenecks, ANDA identifies as the two greatest problems the ignorance of
farmers on the use of fertilizers and the difficulty of obtaining fertilizers
in many areas of the Nor-theast where a considerable potential for increased
consumption exists. As a result of ANTDA's efforts, which included more than
5,000 demonstration and research tests, many more farmers are now aware of the
beneficial effects of fertilizer and modern agricultural practices, and new
companies start to move into areas previously not serviced by fertilizer
suppliers.
As mentioned, with the limited amount of data available, it is not
possible to gain a real insight into the many factors which influence fertilizer
consumption in the Northeast. Projections for the future development of
the Northeastern fertilizer market are therefore bound to have a consider-
able degree of uncertainty.  As is the case for the whole of Brazil,
Government policies in the agricultural and fertilizer sector are probably
the single most important factor which affect the continued growth in
fertilizer consumption. Through the National Fertilizer Program, the
establishment of the Fertilizer Commission, and the introduction of the
subsidy, a considerable amount of interest has been generated in this
sector and it appears that Government policies will be favorable to the
continued growth. Considering that the area averaged an annual growth of
about 22% over the last 10 years, the assumed future growth rate of about
12% per annum used in Annex 7-2 appears feasible.
D. Fertilizer Marketing
The urea and ammonia output of this project will not be sold
directly to the farmer, but to the manufacturers, blenders and mixers
located in the Northeast which will retail complex fertilizers in a variety
of formulas. Traditionally, the Northeast has depended on imports of raw
materials and finished fertilizers and at present only about 50% of N, less
than 10% of soluble P205 and none of the K20 is manufactured in the Northeast.
The industry has therefore settled close to the ports of Recife, Maceio
and Salvador.  Of the 16 companies registered in the Northeast, 12 are
located in Recife, three in Salvador and one in Maceio. However, the mixing
and blending capacity is distributed more closely to the pattern of demand with
about 60% located in Pernambuco (mostly Recife), 20" in Alagoas (mostly
Maceio) and the remaining 20% in other states.  In the near future this
pattern is going to continue, but in the long run a change can be expected
with the exploitation of the Carmopolis potash deposits which is likely to
take place during the 1980s.  The Carmopolis deposit is only about 30 km
to the north of this project so th-at t-o cf the three required nutrients
would be located very close to each other favoring the location of mixing



ANNEX 3-3
Page 7
and blending plants in the same area. This would be a particularly attractive
location if a new port is built nearby through which the required P205 could
be efficiently imported and the excess K20 exported to other Brazilian regions.
During the initial years of the project, production of N is likely
to exceed the requirements of the Northeast (Table 2) and ammonia as well as
urea will have to be shipped to the new port of Aratu and from there to
other regions. Because of the locational advantage of this project to supply
the Northeast with fertilizer, the production from the existing and expanded
plant in Camacari will have to be exported to the Center and South either
via railway but more likely through coastal shipping from Aratu.
Transportation of finished fertilizer in the Northeast is
presently to 97% by road and to only 3% by rail. With the quite limited
railway network and its present inefficiencies, it can be expected that
road transport will remain the dominant mode for finished fertilizers.
Distances for shipping raw and intermediate fertilizer materials
are generally very small because the mixers and blenders are located close
to the ports through which these materials are imported. The only exception
is the urea produced in Salvador which is to 70% shipped by rail to the
companies in Recife and Maceio. The lack of appropriate bulk cars and of
bulk handling equipment at the receiving companies require that PETROFERTIL
ship all the urea which is transported by rail in bags. At the receiving end,
the companies have to tear the bags open to use the urea in their blending
and mixing operations. So far, the volume involved was relatively small
because of the limited capacity of the PETROFERTIL plant in Camacari. However,
with the coming on stream of the expansion in Camacari, all of the nitrogen
required in the Northeast will have to be shipped from Camacari making it more
attractive to ship in bulk although some bag shipments will still be required
to companies which are too small to install bulk unloading facilities. W-ith
the necessity of shipping more intermediate products over large distances, the
railways should become a more important transport mode in the Northeast. The
capacity of the railways to do so and the problems that have to be overcome
have been analyzed by a railway consultant, and his report is summarized in
Annex.
At 90% capacity, the output of the project will include about
80,000 TPY of ammonia for sale of which about 60,000 TPY are likely to be
consumed by ammonium phosphate plants to be built in Recife, Maceio and
Salvador. At present none of these plants is being built, but plans exist
by about five companies of which three are expected to go ahead and build these
plants. The remaining 20,000 TPY of ammonia will probably be exported to
other Brazilian regions together with the excess ammonia of PETROFERTIL's plant
in Camacari.
OnlY very small amounts of ammonia are presently shipped in the
Northeast, and no railway cars are available at this time. Since the output
of ammonia from the Sergipe plant will have to be moved to Recife, Maceio and



ANNEX 3-3
Page 8
Salvador, proper rail cars will be required to do so. Because of the
specialized nature of these cars, BRASFERTIL will most likely have to purchase
and own the cars required and will obtain an appropriate tariff reduction
from the railways in return. The proposed Bank loan includes US$8 million
earmarked for the procurement of specialized railway cars. The exact require-
ments have still to be determined by BRASFERTIL in collaboration with the
railway authorities.
The change from importing nitrogen to local production in the
Northeast will make it necessary to increase the overall storage capacity to
accommodate the cyclical nature of fertilizer consumption. Wiith the very
high cost of short-term financing for working capital, blenders and mixers
try to keep their inventories as low as possible and prefer to adjust to the
cyclical pattern of consumption by working more or less hours per day. To
enable BRASFERTIL to produce steadily at the highest capacity utilization
possible, some form of sharing of inventories with the mixers and blenders
will have to be worked out. It might also be possible to motivate the
farmer to keep higher inventories during the off season by offering him
financial incentives to do so.
Under the growth assumption of 12% per annum made for the Northeast,
the retail and distribution facilities have to be expanded to accommodate
this growth. These facilities are entirely in the private sector, and it is
the Government's policy to provide the policy framework required for the
continuation of the private sector role. In the past, the retail and
distribution system have been able to accommodate very significant fluctu-
ations in the volumes processed, and it is expected that the private sector,
with the support from the Government, will continue to provide the necessary
flexibility. The Fertilizer Market and Marketing Study presently carried out
by the Government has as one of its objectives the identification and formu-
lation of Government policies which would further facilitate the continued
growth of fertilizer use.

BRAZIL - SERGIPE FERTILIZER PROJECT
BRIEF SURVEY OF THE NORTHEASTERN RAILWAYS
The project will be dependent on the railways for the supply of
vacuum gas oil and Bunker C and for shipping ammonia and urea to bulk-
blenders and mixers in Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe and Bahia. The Federal
Railways of Brazil (RFFSA) which operates the railway system in the North-
east, is the recipient of two Bank loans (Loan 786-BR in 1971 of US$46
million and Loan 1074-BR in 1975 of US$175 million) and is now under
active review as part of the Bank's regular project supervision activities.
As part of its appraisal, the Bank asked a consultant to evaluate the capacity
of the railways to reliably move this additional traffic at a speed acceptable
to PETROBRAS and its clients. Most of the traffic will be along the Salvador-
Aracaju-Maceio-Recife line on which the analysis concentrates. The
consultant's findings are briefly summarized below.
I. Traffic Projections
RFFSA has recently, with the help of consultants, completed traffic
origin destination studies for the whole system using 1974 as a base year.
These traffic origin destination figures have now been projected for the
year 1980, and it is hoped in the near future to have these extended to 1985.
The figures for the Salvador-Recife corridor, however, do not include the
expected traffic from the proposed ammonia/urea plant at Laranjeiras (18 km
northwest of Aracaju).
Using RFFSA's projections for 1980 and projecting them to 1995
assuming a 5% per annum growth and adding the traffic which will be generated
by the project results in an upper bound traffic which is probably somewhat
optimistic but which can be used to determine whether line capacity is
sufficient. Table 1, gives some details for the expected traffic between
Salvador and Aracaju which indicates that any reasonably expected traffic
level for the forseeable future is well below what the line in its present
condition can carry at acceptable standards of service. Tonnages projected
for the Aracaju-Recife corridor have not been fully completed, but are
considered lower than those of Salvador-Aracaju.
The characteristics of the line are such that even assuming that
unexpected increases over and above those projected were to take place,
the lengthening of selected crossing sidings and the use of multiple
fraction to haul longer trains could be easily and economically carried out.
No serious problems regarding future line capacity can therefore
be expected as relatively rapid and economic solutions are possible.



ANNEX 3-4
Page 2
II.  Track
Track alignment is not difficult, with minimum curves of 1') m
radius and relatively short ruling grades of 17/000. Xlith the exception
of some 28 kms of earth ballast, stone ballast is used.  However, much
of it (70%) is large, improperly crushed stone which requires cleaning and
re-crushing to allow efficient and economical use of mechanized maintenance
equipment.
RFFSA's track renewal program for the Salvador-Recife corridor
<or th-e next three years, which is considered adequate, includes complete
renewal of all sections of the main line with no stone ballast and presently
laid with 60 lb. rail. Strengthening or replacing of bridges with a less
than 20 ton axle load limit is also included.
III. Speed and Reliability
Density on the Salvador-Recife line is low, with no passenger
service and only an average of 2.5 freight trains per day. All trains are
pick-up trains and consequently average speeds are low because much time
is lost in yards switching and locating cars for unloading. Freight train
maximun speeds are established at L0 km/h and running speeds average
about 30 km/h. With small improvements in track maintenance levels, it
should be possible to raise maximum train speeds to 50 km/h.
Average commercial speeds over the whole of this system are
15 m,/h. This could be considerably improved by programmed unit trains
between Recife, Maceio, Camacari, Mataripe and the project site. The
transport requirements of the project lend themselves very well to unit
trains, and this would constitute a significant improvement over present
operations where trains are not scheduled but are run according to demand.
It is estimated that about 10% of the trains running in the North-
east have some form of a derailment often caused by poor track maintenance,
non-obeyance of speed limits and other operator errors. This large
number of derailments must definitely be reduced to reliably move the
products required for the project. This is particularly required for the
safe transport of ammonia, a hazardous cargo with a great destructive
potential.
IV. Rolling Stock
Besides locomotives and standard boxcars for bagged urea shipments
and to be supplied by RFFSA, three type of special cars are needed for the
project:
(i)   Standard fuel tank cars for shipping vacuum gas o_l and
Bunker C. These will be supplied by RFFSA with no
purchases additional to those already included in the
investment program;



ANNEX 3-4
Page 3
(ii)   Liquid ammonia tank cars will have to be procured
by FERTILIZANTES since they will be the only user of
these cars. It is estimated that 65 cars are required; and
(iii) Covered hopper cars, fully lined for the transport of
urea in bulk. These will also have to be procured by
FERTILIZANTES, and an estimated 45 cars are required.
These cars would initially be used to ship the surplus
urea to the port of Aratu and later for the supply
of bulk urea to companies in the Northeast.
FERTILIZANTES has already exchanged letters with RFFSA agreeing
in principle to the above division of procurement. Agreements on who will
be responsible for maintenance of the cars to be owned by FERTILIZANTES will
still have to be worked out.
V. Recommendations
RFFSA is at present in a unique and favorable situation with regard
to the Salvador-Aracaju-Maceio-Recife line. Present traffic is insignificant
with no priority passenger traffic to take precedence.
The alignment, trace and installations have been bu-lt to basically
good standards and the renewal and upgrading program between now and 1979
can provide a rail line capable of handling 1,000,000 tons annually and of
being further upgraded at reasonable cost to handle very much larger
tonnages. Due to the present low traffic density, upgrading and renewal
can be carried out under optimum conditions and a complete new working time-
table can be established for the future. Preference should therefore be
concentrated on this work as indicated in the following recommendations.
1. Operation
RFFSA should make a new study of proposed traffic for the Salvador-
Recife line and establish a timetable based on scheduled trains giving
priority to through freight and special traffic moved by unit trains.
Consideration should also be given to determine the overall
economies in speed and turnaround of using two locomotives instead of one,
increasing the train loads to 17 to 18 cars. Train routing would then
prove more flexible and terminal operations more economical.
2. Track
The renewal program as now drawn up should be reviewed and
priorities allotted to those sections whose work can be carried out rapidly
during daylight hours without interference from traffic.
Improved track maintenance is a must if speed and reliability is
to be increased and derailments avoided.



ANNEX 3-4
Page 4
3. Stations
Secondary track and auxiliary track in stations is laid with
lighter rail and, although in acceptable condition for the existing services,
should be put into better condition for the expected future increase in
traffic.
Switches and turnouts should be thoroughly repaired and brought up
to standard to avoid excessive speed restrictions and danger of derailments.
Switch position indicators on the main line should be installed and switch
blade locking bars used also on main line switches in the interests of
speed and safety.
VI. Implementation of Recommendations
The consultant's report has been made available to FERTILIZANTES
and to RFFSA and the appraisal mission discussed the consultant's findings
in detail with these two organizations. The railways in principle agreed
to the consultant's recommendations, but it will be up to FERTILIZANTES to
ensure that the necessary steps are taken to their implementation. Since
the Bank is already actively involved in RFFSA, the Industrial Projects
Department's supervision effort to monitor implementation of the above
recommendations will be coordinated with the Bank's regional project
department's transportation staff.

BRAZIL - SERGIPE FERTILIZER PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A.    Production Processes
1.        The rated output of the plant will be 1100 MTD urea and 269 HD
ammonia after use of 638 MTD ammonia as an intermediate in the production
of urea. Annual production of end products based on 330 days operation at
100% capacity will be 363,000 tons urea and 88,800 tons ammonia. For the
production of ammonia, the Kellogg high pressure steam reforming process
shall be used starting with natural gas feed originating from PETROBRAS on
and off shore deposits in Sergipe and Alagoas states. Typical gas compositions
for both dry and wet gas are given in Annex 4-5 and the reformer unit and
catalyst will be chosen to handle either composition although dry gas will be
the normal feedstock. For the production of urea, the Mitsui Toatsu total
recycle C process will be used, using ammonia and carbon dioxide produced in
the ammonia process as raw materials. Specifications of ammonia produced
both for sale and conversion into urea will be :
Anhydrous ammonia                    99.8 wt. % max.
Water and residue content             0.2 wt. % max.
Oil content (by weight)             10 ppm max.
Liquid ammonia produced for storage and sale will be at -33oC.  Urea shall
be produced in prilled form to the following specifications
Total nitrogen  (by weight)          46.3% min.
Biuret           ("  )                0.9 % max.
Moisture         ("    "   )          0.3 % max.
Iron             (         )            2 ppm max.
Ash              ("        )           20 ppm max.
Free ammonia    ("    "   )           200 ppm max.
Grain size 1.2 - 3 mm ( " )            90 % min.
Consumption of raw materials and services in the production of ammonia and
urea are given in Annex 4-3.
2.        For the production of ammonia synthesis gas, natural gas feedstock
shall be delivered to the plant at a minimum pressure of 200 psig and then
compressed inside the plant to 450 psig by a steam driven centrifugal
compressor and desulphurised by reaction with hot zinc oxide. Ammonia
synthesis gas is produced from the compressed sweetened feedgas in a series of
steps beginning with a primary reforming with steam. Here the feed gas is
combined with superheated steam in an amount approximately equal to a 3 to 1
steam/carbon ratio. The combined stream at a pressure of approximately 450
psig is then preheated to about 950 degrees F. and passed through catalyst-
filled 25/20 chrome nickel alloy tubes suspended in the radiant section of
the reformer. In passing through the tubes the hydrocarbon components, mostly
methane, are partly converted to carbon oxides and hydrogen and exit at a



ANNEX 4-2
Page 2
temperature normally in excess of 15000 F.  The reformer tubes are heated
externally by combustion of vacuum gas oil having a very low heavy metal
content (less than 0.2 ppm vanadium and 0.1 ppm nickel) to avoid contamination
and weakening of the reformer tube alloy material. The reformer is also equipped
with soot blowers to remove any unburnt material from the tube surfaces.
The parti ally reformed gas from the primary steam reformer then passes to a
secondary reformer where it is mixed with preheated air in a quantity necessary
to reform the unconverted hydrocarbons and at the same time provide the required
amount of nitrogen for ammonia synthesis.  Air required for the secondary
reforming step is supplied from a centrifugal steam turbine driven compressor.
Reformed gas from the secondary reformer now containing less than about 0.4%
methane is cooled in waste heat boilers down to about 7000 F. prior to
introduction to the high temperature shift converter where part of the carbon
monoxide content of the gas is converted to carbon dioxide by reaction with
steam with an equivalent production of hydrogen.  To complete this conversion
of carbon monoxide the gas after cooling in additional waste heat boilers
and after a protective fine sulphur removal is introduced into a second stage
low temperature converter where the carbon monoxide content of the gas is
reduced to less than 0.5%. The raw synthesis gas now contains essentially
hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and small amounts of hydrocarbons and
carbon monoxide and now goes through a series of purification steps to
provide an ammonia synthesis gas with a hydrogen/nitrogen ratio of 3 to 1.
In the first of these carbon dioxide is removed via the Eickmeyer "Catacarb"
process using hot potassium carbonate solution containing an amine-borate
activator and corrosion inhibitor as absorbent and a split stream absorption/
desorption cycle to reduce energy consumption. Remaining oxides of carbon
are then removed from the semi-purified synthesis gas by conversion to
methane and water by reaction with hydrogen over a suitable catalyst. The
final synthesis gas consisting of nitrogen and hydrogen then contains less
than 10 ppm oxides, (the maximum that can be tolerated by the ammoLia
synthesis catalyst), as well as small amounts of methane which are continually
purged from the following ammonia synthesis loop.
3.        In the synthesis of agmonia fresh synthesis gas (nitrogen and
hydrogen) and ammonia converter recycle gas containing about 11% ammonia,
are compressed to a pressure of approximately 2500 psig in a two case steam
turbine driven centrifugal compressor. The compressed gas is then water
cooled and subjected to three stages of chilling to condense out ammonia
which is removed in a liquid separator. The disengaged gas containing
only about 2% ammonia vapour, is then reheated by heat exchange with the
compressor discharge gas and converter effluent before entering the
convertor. Ammonia synthesis takes place in this converter which contai,ns
four beds of triply promoted iron catalyst and is of special des gn to
remove the reaction heat developed while maintaining or,timum reaction
temperature for maximum yield and catalyst life.  The converter effluent
containing about 11% ammonia Is cooled from the reaction temperature of
about 9000 F first in preheating boiler feedwaater and then by heat exchange
with incoming converter feed gas, before recycling to the second case of
the synthesis gas compressor as described. A three stage refrigeration
system provides the refrigeration for ammonia condensation in the synthesis
loop, recovery of ammonia from purge gas, synthesis compressor interstage
chilling, and refrigeration of the anhydrous liquid ammonia product. Liquid
ammonia from the separator is let down through a low-pressure separator and
the refrigeration system before being delivered at -330G to storage.

4.        In the production of urea, carbon dioxide (desorbed from the CO2
removal process rich solution) and ammonia are combined at a pressure of
2,000 - 3,500 psi and a temperature of approximately 200 degrees C when
ammonium carbamate is formed as an intermediate product, which is sub-
sequently dehydrated with formation of urea. Neither of these reactions,
however, proceeds to completion with the result that the reaction product
consists of a urea/ammonia carbamate solution containing large quantities
of dissolved ammonia and carbon dioxide. The next step in the production
of urea therefore is to separate the non-converted carbamate and reaction
gases and recycle them to the reactor, and the means of doing this
represents the major distinction between the various processes commercially
available. In the Mitsui Toatsu Total Recycle C improved process gaseous carbon
dioxide (compressed to reaction pressure by combined centrifugal and
reciprocating compression system) and liquid ammonia enter the urea
synthesis reactor together with recycle ammonium carbamate solution. The
operating conditions in the reactor are 3675 psig and 1950 C and the
molecular NH3/C02 ratio is 4, giving a one-pass conversion of carbon
dioxide to urea of about 68%. The reaction products consisting of urea,
unconverted ammonium carbamate, excess ammonia and water leave the top of
the reactor through a pressure let-down valve and pass to the decomposition
section of the process, where excess ammonia and unconverted ammonium
carbamate are separated from urea solution step wise in a high pressure
decomposer, low pressure decomposer, vacuum decomposer, and filter,
operating at 257 psig, 29 psig, and 9 pst respectively. The urea solution
leaving the vacuum decomposer has a composition of about 72% urea, 0.3%
ammonia and 0.3% biuret.  In the recovery section of the plant the overhead
gases from the three decomposers are condensed and absorbed in their
respective condensers or absorbers using condensate from the vacuum absorber
as absorbent for the low pressure absorber and solution from the low pressure
absorber as absorbent for the high pressure absorber with the solution from
the high pressure absorber being finally pumped back to the urea reactor.
The overhead gas from the high pressure absorber, pure ammonia, is absorbed
in water and also returned to the reactor. The urea solution from the
vacuum decomposer after filtration is sent to the vacuum concentrator for
concentration up to 83% by weight and then pumped to the urea solution
evaporator on top of the prilling tower to produce a 99.7% urea melt. As
the molten urea falls down the prilling tower, it is prilled and cooled by
up-coming air from the fluidised bed cooler at the base of the tower and
from natural draft. The effluent air from the top of the tower containing
urea dust is scrubbed with urea solution in an effluent scrubber located on
top of the tower. The prilled urea is removed from the base of the tower
by a belt conveyor, through a trommel to remove any lumps, and a belt scale
to measure production.
B.    Plant Facilities
5.        The following facilities for the storage and handling of products
are provided as part of the project. Prilled urea after weighing is
conveyed to a urea coating plant for coating with an agent consisting of
clay, limestone and diatomacious earth. The bulk urea storage building has
a capacity of 30,000 metric tons and is equipped with four dehumidifiers.



ANNEX 4-2
Page 4
Urea reclaiming is by portal scraper reclaimer discharging to a reclaim
conveyor which directs reclaimed urea either to bagging or bulk load-out.
For bulk load-out, three 100 ton load-out bins are provided each equipped
with load cells for weighing pre-set loads into rail cars or trucks. The
bagging plant which is capable of bagging the entire urea output if
required, consists of four bagging lines each equipped with 50 ton feed
bins, 40-50 ton per hour four-spout bagging machines, and conveying
equipment for bagged product. A dehumidifying unit provides dehumidified
air to all feed bins and dust collection equipment serves all necessary
locations. Bags are 50 kg capacity valve type polyethylene. Filled bags
are conveyed to semi-automatic palletising station from which the palletised
loads are taken by fork lift to storage (3000 ton capacity) or loading
stations. The palletising, load-out and storage areas are contained in the
bagging building. Liquid ammonia is stored in a 10,000 ton refrigerated
storage tank located close to the ammonia unit battery limits and operated
at - 330 C under a slight positive pressure using the battery limits
ammonia refrigeration system but with a 50 ton standby refrigeration unit
provided. Load-out facilities to handle 400 metric tons per 8 hour shift
are provided consisting of six rail car and two tank truck loading arms
with pumping equipment, as well as one loading scale each for rail and road
tankers.
6.        In addition to the facilities for raw water supply (described
in para 10) and the effluent treatment provisions (described
in paras 7-8), the following ancillary facilities are provided as part
of the project to support the materials processing operations. Incoming
raw water to the plant site is stored in a raw water storage basin having
a capacity of 6 million gallons, sufficient for 4 hours fire water and 24
hours raw water supply. Water from the storage basin is pretreated in a
clarifier by addition of chlorine, alum, coagulant aid and lime before
being filtered and stored in a 920 M3 pretreated water storage tank. A
three train 650 GPM water demineralisation plant is provided to produce
boiler feedwater suitable for use in a 1500 psig steam system. An 1800
M3 demineralised water storage tank is included. The plant cooling system
is based on a closed circuit cooling water system complete with multi cell
induced draft cooling tower, cooling water pumps and chemical treatment
system. A complete fire protection system is provided including firewater
loop with cross-overs and hydrants, fixed water spray system to protect
major machinery, foam protection system for fuel storage, foam truck,
standby pumps and controlls.  Primary electric power distribution within
the plant site is at 13.8 KV to transformers at the ammonia unit, utilities
area and urea unit. The plant steam system is based on 1500 psig within
the ammonia unit (self generated) and 650 psig elsewhere generated by two
120,000 lb./hr. service boilers each normally operating at 50% capacity. Condensates
from the two systems are treated in separate systems. Centralised plant air
and instrument air systems normally supplied from the ammonia unit air
compressor are provided to serve the ammonia, urea and offsite facilities.



ANNEX 4-2
Page 5
A 500 CFM inert gas generator acts as backup to the instrument air system
and is used to supply inert blanket and purge gas. Storage tanks for
vacuum gas oil and Bunker C of capacities 10,000 barrels and 5,000 barrels
respectively are included. One steam turbine driven emergency power
generator is provided to supply all lighting and instrumentation require-
ments, sustain continuous operation of the ammonia unit, and provide enough
power to the urea unit to permit orderly shut-down. The project will also
be complete with maintenance, administration, warehousing, and other
necessary facilities to allow self contained operation.
C. Ecology
7.        Discharge of noxious materials into  the atmosphere and  inland
waters is presently controlled by the Pbllution Control Agency (PCA) acting
under the authority of the Minister of the Interior through the Environmental
Special Secretary (SEMA). Under decrees issued in 1973 and 1975 inland waters
within the national territory may be classified into four groups according to
their main uses, with maximum concentrations of contaminants for each being
fixed. Discharge of effluent is permitted into waters of all classes except
that intended for household supply without previous treatment, provided the
effluent conforms to set standards relating to acidity, temperature, insoluble
matter and concentration of noxious substances and providing that after dis-
charge, the limits of contaminants for the particular classification are not
exceeded. Maximum allowable quantity of effluent discharged is determined by
the PCA. Order No. 231 published by the i-Linistry of the Interior in I4ay 1976
established standards for air quality. Both of these regulations covering
air and water quality standards, which will be applied to the operations
of the project, have been adjudged as satisfactory.
8.        Modern ammonia/urea plants are not significant polluters of the
environment. Major atmospheric pollutants are sulfur dioxide in the flue gas
from the primary reforming unit and auxiliary boilers, and carbon dioxide
extracted from the crude ammonia synthesis gas. For the Sergipe plant flue
gas stacks for both the primary reformer and auxiliary boilers will be of
sufficient height to maintain ground level S02 concentration within acceptable
levels while about 70% of the carbon dioxide produced will be converted to
urea. Other potential atmospheric pollutants are small leakages of ammonia
from pressure relief valves and compressor seal pots, and urea dust from the
top of the Prilling Tower, but these are expected to be minimal. Sources of
liquid effluent pollutants are process condensates from the ammonia unit,
oily waste waters, cooling tower blowdown, demineralization plant wastes,
losses of urea from urea evaporator condenser, spillage from the urea unit,
and sanitary effluent. The Sergipe plant will include facilities for removal
of contaminants from the condensates from the ammonia unit and urea
evaporator before discharge, and for collection and removal of oil from waste
waters. Additionally, cooling tower blow down will be treated for removal of
chromates and demineralization plant waste neutralized. A sewerage treatment
plant will be provided for sanitary waste. The overall effluient treatment
system inclusive of these facilities will be based on the above-mentioned
Brazilian water and air quality standards.

D. Site Description and Justification
9.        The company has purchased a 100 hectare grass roots site at
Laranjeiras about 20 kmn northwest of Aracaju in the state of Sergipe for
construction of thc plant. The site is situated on the Sergipe River and has
good road and rail connections being served by the existing road from Aracaju
and by the Salvador-Recife railway passing nearby. A 5-km line linking this
railway with the plant will be constructed by Brazilian railways but financed
by the company.  This rail link will permit shipment to the north and south
of bulk liquid ammonia and urea in special rail tankers and box cars to be
purchased by the company, and delivery of heavy fuel oil and vacuum gas oil
to a fuel storage depot to be constructed beside the site by PhTROBRAS
which will serve the entire Aracaju area in addition to the plant itself.
Electric power for the project will be supplied at 69 KV from the Guajara
substation (to be completed in 1977) some 12 km distant via an exclusive
transmission line, and via a second normal line from the same substation.
These transmission lines will be built by ENERGIPE, the local power authority,
independently of the project.
10.       WIater requirements of the plant will be met via a new 90 Jkm long, 900-
1,200 mm diameter water pipeline and 4,500 HP pumping station to be constructed
by PETROBRAS to draw water at the rate of 5,040 cubic meters/hour from the Sao
Francisco River for supply to the towm of Aracaju and to Petrobras Potash
Works about 25 km northeast of Laranjeiras.  A branch line from this main will
supply the project's normal requirements of 900 cubic meters/hour and maximum
demand of 1,800 cubic metersAhour. The whole scheme has been studied by a
Brazilian consulting firm (HIDSANIl - Engenharia Hidraulica e Sanitaria Ltda.)
who has estimated its total cost at Cr$375 million. This cost will be
shared 17% by the company, 17% by PETROBRAS and 66% by the National Housing
Bank for the state of Sergipe.
11.       Prior to selecting the Laranjeiras site, the company examined five
potential sites in the general area of Aracaju purstuant to an instruction from
the Government consistent with its policy of decentralizing industrial develop-
ment from the Salvador area. In considering each of these locations, the
company took into account the following factors: topographical, geological,
air and water pollution, security, power supply, railway and highway access,
prevailing wind direction, limitation on expansion, land acquisition constraints
and shipping and receiving of materials. An economic comparison of site
development costs was also prepared on the basis of costs of land acquisition,
site preparation, and provision of water, power and gas supplies, and
construction of rail and road connections.  Within the constraint of the
restrictions on building high structures within 20 u'i of the Aracaju airport,
the Laranjeiras site was identified as the economic optimu.m.

The staff will be recruited from the Aracaju area or transferred from
PETROBRAS refinery or Petroquisa's fertilizer plant operations. It is
expected the local university will provide many of the staff required to fill
the professional positions.
13.       PETROBRAS has an excellent training program to supply the large
number of skilled staff required for its expanding refinery and petrochemical
operations, and its subsidiaries operate two ammonia/urea complexes that can
provide in-plant training. These facilities will be available to help the
company train the required number of staff to fill skilled positions.
Additionally, the ammonia plant contractor (Pullman Kellogg, USA) will arrange
for a two-month training program for six of the company's engineers (process,
operation and maintenance) in his own offices and in a similar operational
ammonia plant involving the participation of his own expert technicians.  The
urea plant contractor (Toyo Engineering Corporation, Japan) will provide a
similar training program for six of the company's engineers. These key
personnel will, therefore, receive intensive instruction abroad in the latest
ammonia and urea process technology and plant operational techniques.
1/ In the table on page 2, Annex 4-6, most technical support personnel have
been assigned to manufacturing units for purposes of computing manufacturing
costs.

F. Description of Project Organization
The project -will be executed on behalf of FERTILIZANTES by PETROBRASt
Fertilizer Project Implementation Unit (COFEEN). This unit is organized into
technical, contracts, and procurement divisions with the technical division
being split into three groups each under a project manager with responsibility
for the Sergipe, Araucaria, and Campos projects, respectively. COFEN
supported by PETROBRAS' Engineering Services department will assume overall
responsibility for project management and technical supervision, co-ordinate
the work of the foreign and local engineering companies, and contract
directly with local firms (yet to be selected) for construction of the
facilities.  The unit is administratively responsible through PETROBRAS
Engineering Services department to PETROBRAS executive directors, bu-t for
matters relating to the project it will be directly responsible to the
executive directors of FEIRTILIZANTES. iERTILIZANTES' own procurement
department will be responsible for procurement of all equipment and materials
required for the project other than critical items which will be procured
by the foreign engineering companies.
G. Implementation Plan
l5.       Contracts have been signed with Pullman Kellogg (USA) for provision
of process license, basic engineering design, procurement assistance, and
technical advisory services relating to the arnonia unit and offsites
facilities, and with the Toyo Engineering Company (Japan) for provision of
process license and similar services for the urea unit. Detailed engineering
of the ammonia unit and general plant facilities will be undertaken by a
Brazilian firm, Promon Engenharia S.A. (PROMON), acting as nominated sub-
contractor and under the supervisicn of Kellogg.  Another local engineering
firm, Montreal Engenharia S.A. (MONTREAL), will undertake detailed engineering
of the urea unit as nominated subcontractor and under +he supervision of
Toyo.  The project is scheduled for commencement of conP-e-cial operation by
January 1, 1981, as shown in Annex 4-6.

BRAZIL - SERGIPE FERTILIZER PROJECT
NATURAL GAS RESERVES - SERGIPE AND ALAGOAS STATES
1.        Gas reserves in Sergipe and Alagoas States available for use by
the project are located in four different areas, most of which are still
in the exploratory and development plan. These areas and the producing
fields within each are as below:
1.  Sergipe Onshore           Carmopolis
Siririzinho
2. Sergipe Offshore           Guaricema
Caioba
Camorim
Dourado
Robalo
Tainha
3. Alagoas Onshore            Furado
Cidade de Sao Miguel dos Campos
Sao Miguel dos Campos
4. Alagoas Offshore           Mero
Cavala
2.        Table 1 shows the reserves of gas in these four areas as estimated
by PETROBRAS in November 1976 from basic geological, engineering and
production data collected by the company. A firm of petroleum consultants
hired by the Bank (Ise Keeling and Associates, Tulsa, USA) reviewed the
companyIs evaluation techniques and procedures, random checked electric
logs, reservoir data, PVT analysis, fluid characteristics, performance
data, test information and studied structure and isopachous maps made
available.  A1l of the offshore fields are still in the stage of develop-
ment and exploration so estimates of reserves of these fields are subject
to considerable variation. However, prospects for further increasing the
reserves estimates are claimed to be excellent due to the expectation of
developing several dry gas wells presently "shut-in" for which no reserves
are currently assigned and the geological potential of the presently unex-
plored area which PETROBRAS estimates may amount to over 10 billion cubic
meters.
3.        During 1976 six fields were producing gas at a total rate of
approximately 30 million cubic meters per month. Three of the onshore fields
(Furado, Carmopolis and Siririzinho) have been producing oil and associated
gas since prior to 1973, and most of the excess gas produced in these areas
has been flared.  However, PETROBRAS has tentative plans to reinject and



ANNEX 4-4
Page 2
store some of the Furado and Carmopolis gas during the years 1977-79. Five
presently drilling offshore and six additional platforms have recently been
approved for construction.  The rate of gas production is continuing to
increase in all fields as new wells are drilled.
4.        The cluster of four fields lying directly offshore from the plant
site are being developed at this time. Caioba and Guaricema fields have been
connected to shore installations since 1973/74 while Dourado and Camorim
fields were connected in June 1976. Oil and associated gas are processed
in the gas/liquid separation installation onshore. Oil is then shipped to
PETROBRAS refinery in Bahia and gas transported to Bahia through a 14-inch
transmission line. For complete utilization of gas to be produced in the North-
east region, PErROBRAS will construct a new 170 km long, 10-inch diameter
transmission line from the Furado field to Carmopolis passing through the
intermediate gas field areas. At Carmopolis new gas gathering and compression
facilities will be built to recover gas presently being flared. A new 50 km
long, 14-inch pipeline will then transport this gas and gas from the Northeast
to the Aracaju treatment plant which will also be expanded.  Dry gas from the
e7panded treatment facilities will be supplied to the plant site through a
new pipeline to be built by PETROBRAS.
',.       Table 2 shows projected production and consumption of gas up to
1995 with remaining reserves based on present estimated proven and total
~I -rY .ves.

ANNEX 5-1
Page 1
BRAZIL - SERGIPE FERTILIZER PROJECT
CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS
1.        The Base Cost Estimate reflects estimated prices as of December
1976. Local expenditures have been estimated in Cruzeiros and foreign
expenditures in US dollars. Estimates were made by PETROBRAS' engineering
department using data supplied by the foreign engineering firms and prices
for similar equipment purchased by PETROBRAS and escalated to December 1976.
The exchange rate used is Cr$12.35 = US$1.00 which was the official rate as
of December 31, 1976. Below is a summary of the main assumptions made.
2.        Land requirements are about 600,000 m2 at a unit cost of Cr$2.0
per m2.
3.        The water pipeline which will serve the project is estimated to
cost a total of Cr$375 million of which 17% would have to be borne by the
project. Civil works for this are shown under infrastructure and are
estimated at Cr$27 million, while materials are shown under production
equipment and materials and are estimated to be Cr$37 million.
4.        The 5-km raillink between the main line Salvador-Recife and the
project site and the railway yard has been estimated by the Bank's consultant
to cost about Cr$56 million (or Cr$17 million in mid-1976 prices).  Of the
expected traffic, about 35% would be used by PETROBRAS' distribution company
to service its storage facilities to be built adjacent to the project site.
Therefore, only 65% or Cr$37 million are shown as a cost to the project of
which Cr$18 million are shown for civil works under infrastructure and
Cr$19 million for materials under production equipment and materials.
5.        Unit costs for general civil works including all offsite buildings
such as administration, restaurant, laboratories, security, maintenance
workshops, etc., are as listed below:
Administration         (1,000 sq.m.)    -    US$430/sq.m.
Guard House            (80 sq.m.)        -    US$595/sq.m.
Restaurant, etc.       (800 sq.m.)       -    US$595/sq.m.
Maintenance            (3,000 sq.m.)    -    US$265/sq.m.
Laboratory             (400 sq.m.)       -    US$570/sq.m.
Industrial Safety      (200 sq.m.)       -    US$570/sq.m.
Warehouse              (1,500 sq.m.)    -    US$220/sq.m.
Urea Store             (9,000 sq.m.)    -    US$240/sq.m.
6.        Plant civil works have been estimated by using PETROFERTIL's actual
and estimated costs of the Camacari expansion as a basis and by escalating
these to December 1976. The Camacari expansion is expected to be commissioned
during the latter half of 1977.
7.        The production and miscellaneous equipment and material costs have
been estimated by using PETROFERTIL's actual costs and PETROBRAS' and the



ANNEX 5-1
Page 2
engineering firms' estimates. The split between international and local
procurement has been made in a way that the overall amount of equipment
reserved for Brazilian suppliers would be 60% on an FOB basis. The number
of railway cars required for the project has been estimated by PETROBRAS in
detail in cooperation with the federal railways. As a result it is estimated
that 45 bulk urea cars (50 tons net) and 65 ammonia tank cars (40 tons net)
to be owned by FERTILIZANTES would be required at a unit cost of Cr$630,000
and Cr$840,000, respectively.
8.        Plant construction costs have also been estimated by using
PETROFERTIL's actual costs as a basis.
9.        Cost of engineering services is based on actual contract obligations
and estimated reimbursable costs.
10.       Freight and insurance for items internationally procured is
estimated at 15% of the FOB value. For locally procured items, 5% of the
FOB value is used for this. These estimates are based on average actual costs
incurred in PETROFERTIL's project in Camacari.
11.       Physical contingencies are calculated according to Table 3 of this
Annex. Contingencies for price escalation have been determined by estimating
commitment dates for equipment orders and mid-disbursement dates for civil
works, as shown in Table 4. and by using the follo-wing escalation rates:
1977 1978 1979
For Equipment and Materials                 8%    8%    8%
For Civil Works and Plant Construction   12%   12%   12%
12.       Interest during construction calculations are based on a Bank loan
of US$64 million at 10% interest (8.5% foreign, 1.5% local), a cofinancing
arrangement of US$25 million at 10% interest in foreign currency and a BNDE
loan of US$81.2 million at a real interest of 4% in local currency. The
assumed disbursements are as follows:
1977    1978    1979    1980
Bank, BNDE     7%       30%      43%     20%
Cofinancing    -       100%      -        -
13.       Table 1 of this Annex gives the capital cost estimate by type of
currency requirement, i.e. foreign and local. Table 2 shows the capital
costs by type of procurement, i.e. ICB and local and also showing in the
second column the amounts for equipment and materials expected to be won by
Brazilian suppliers participating in international competitive bidding. To
calculate Table 1, it has been assumed that the indirect foreign exchange
content of Brazilian equipment and materials would be 25% and 15% for civil
works and plant construction.
14.       Detailed working capital calculations are given in Annex 5-2.

BRAZIL - SERGIPE FERTILIZER PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
A.   Inflation Accountina
1.     Brazil has been forced to cope with considerable rates of
inflation over the past two decades. In 1964 it promulgated a system of
'monetary corrections and flexible exchange rates' to obtain better con-
trol over rising inflation rates. The 'Brazilian Model' worked satisfactory un-
til the oil crisis provoked a sudden push of imported inflation in early
197I which let inflation rates rise up to a level of about hL% p.a.
2.     To avoid unnecessary distortions as a result of an uncertain
development of Brazil's inflation and to facilitate comparisons with other
similar projects it was decided to express all financial projections in
current US Dollars. Assuming that the policy of the Government taken in
the past to adjusting the foreign exchange value of the Cruzeiro according
to the difference of domestic and international inflation rates will continue,
the following inflation rates were applied within the financial analysis:
International               Inflation Rate %
Year       Price Inflation %         Mid Year    End of Year
1976              9                     0            a 5
1977              8                   8.5             8.0
78             8                   8.0             8.0
79             8                   8.0             8.0
80             7                    7.5            7.0
81-93              7                   7.0             7.0
3.     Since the formulation of the monetary correction system in
1964 a series of laws and decrees were introduced regulating the use of
the monetary correction factors within the financial statements of
companies. These regulations - especially in respect of income tax
purposes - change from time to time, as the federal authorities wish
to stimulate or to depress internal expansion and savings. For the
purpose of the financial projections the latest accounting rules were
applied, with the difference that instead of the domestic 'monetary
correction factor' the international inflation rate as 'indexing factor'
was used.
L.     According to Brazil's accounting principles, fixed assets
as well as local long-term loans are subject to monetary adjustments
and are indexed respectively. The difference between the reevaluation
1/ For reasons of simplification, a reevaluation of total fixed assets
at every year's end is assumed whereas Brazil's accounting rules allow
only tie application of indexation starting with the year following
the acquisition.



ANiA 6-1
Page 2
of fixed assets and of the local long-term loans is added to equity to
restore the balance between the asset and liability side. Since the
financial projections are expressed in current US$ there is no need
to consider adjustments reflecting increases of principle repayments
for foreign loans due to changes in the exchange rate. In accordance
with the present accounting procedures applied by Petrobras, no pro-
visions for indexation of working capital are made.
5.     The computation of the indexed values in the fixed assets
schedule (Annex 6-3 Tablel) and debt service schedule (Annex 6-3 Table 2)
is done in the following way: AU expenses and incoming funds were
discounted into terms of constant Dollars of mid-1976 and afterwards
inflated to current US Dollars. For assets, the end-of-year index is
used whereas for outstanding debts, the mid-year index is applied.
B.   Revenues
6.     So far, FERTILIZANTES has not developed a detailed pricing
policy for its fertilizer products. However, in principle the company
is committed to two main considerations. First, since FERTILIZANTES
intends to sell shares to the private sector, prices hpve to be high
enough to generate sufficient profits and dividends to make the company
attractive for private investors. Second, FERTILIZANTES has a mandate
from the Government to produce and sell fertilizer materials at stable
prices comparable to those prevailing in the international market. The
Bank's long-range international price forecast shows in constant terms
of 1976 an FOB price range between US$165 and US$171 per ton of bagged
urea 1/ for the years 1980 and 1985 respectively. From an international
FOB price of US$171 per ton of bagged urea an ex-factory price for bulk
urea of US$205 per ton in constant 1976 dollars can be determined which
would gratify both requirements mentioned above and which is deduced as
follows:
Constant 1976
Urea (h6% N)                                   US$/Ton
FOB Price (bagged)                               171

7.     Ammonia is assumed to have a 1:1 price relationship to urea
(bulk) reflecting that the production costs of N in amuonia are about 55%
of the production cost of N in urea. Consequently, a sals price fcr surplus ammonia
of US$205 and US$175 is estimated for deliveries to the Northeast and Center Region, respectively.
C.  ODeratinU   Costs
8.     It is assumed that the plant will start commercial operations
by January 1981. During the first twelve months a 70% utilization of
capacity is assumed which will increase to 80 and 90% in the second and
third twelve months period respectively and will stay constant thereafter.
A 90% utilization corresponds to the following production volumes if 330
operating days/year are considered at 100% capacity utilization (leaving
35 days per year for scheduled maintenance):
Daily        Yearly Production at a 90%
Capacity     Capacity Utilization in
in tons      Thousand Tons
Ammonia                                907              296.4
Surplus Ammonia to be sold             269               79.9
Urea                                 1,100              326.7
9.    AU the operating costs as shown in Annex 6-2 are calculated
on the basis of 1976 prices.  The resulting operating cost estimated for
ammonia and urea are then escalated with the international inflation index
to the respective year when they enter the projected income statement
(Annex 6-3 Table 3)
10.    The prices for feedstock and fuel ex-pipeline or ex-distribution
terminal used in the financial analysis are based on the information given
by the 'Consejo Nacional de Petroleo' taking into account the most recent
price increase which took place July 1, 1976.

11.    The price for electrical power varies slightly with the amount
of consumption, since part of the power costs are charged on a fixed monthly
basis independently of the amount of consumed KWHs. Based on the demand
forecasts of electrical power at a 90% capacity utilization, the price per
KWH amounts to US$0.02.

12.    The water will be supplied from the Sao Francisco River through
a water pipeline which will provide the town of Aracaju as we1l as the
project with sufficient quantities. Most likely FERTIIIZANTES will partici-
pate in the financing of the pipeline cost with an amount of US$8.6 million
and will receive in return the required water quantities at the preferential
rate of US$0.17 per cubic meter.
13.    To bag its urea output, the Sergipe plant will use domestically
produced 50 kg polyethelene bags. The mid-1976 price for this kind of bag
was Cr$ 4.0. In spite of the plant being equipped with facilities which
allow the bagging of 100% of the urea output, it is assumed that only 7C%
of urea will be delivered in bags. During the first four years of opera-
tion approximately 3C0 of the urea output will be sent to the Center as
bulk. In 1985 practically no shipments from the Sergipe plant to the
Center will take place. However, by that timne a considerable part of the
urea customers (bulkblenders, mixers, cooperatives and wholesalers) should
have installed facilities to handle bulk urea.
14.   At present 85% of all fertilizers are carried by road trans-
port in the Northeast. But it is the explicit plan of the Government to
shift as much traffic as possible to rail transport. Since it is the
policy of RFFSA (the federal railroad company) to provide only rolling
stock which can be used for multi-purposes (locomotives and box cars for
bagged urea) FlRTILIZANTES has to acquire its own rail cars for ammonia/
urea (bulk) transport. The project includes some 110 wagons at an estimated
cost of US$8 million. These cars will be financed by FERTILIZANTES,
which will recover its investment by reduced tariffs.
15.   The annual depreciation I/ in terms of 1976 prices is calculated
as per the table below:

16.    The project is expected to have the following structure of
employment:
Number of Employees
a)  Operating Directors                                3
b)  Administrative Staff                             156
c)  Technical Staff                                  112
d)  Factory Staff                                    113
Total                                        38h
17.    At an average salary of US$1,000 per month, the estimated
yearly payroll is US$4.6 million.
18.    Cost of maintenance is assumed to be about 2.6% of the
capitalized value of the plant.
19.    To estimate product costs for ammonia and urea, operating
costs have been estimated for each cost center including the production
units for ammonia and urea and all utilities. The variable and fixed
costs (except for general overhead) of utilities have been allocated to
the production units according to the demand for the services provided
by the utilities to the production units. The costs of general overhead
facilities were allocated to the ammonia and urea unit on the basis of
their capital cost ratio (60/h0).
20.    Projections of FERTITIZANTES' debt (Annex 6-3, Table 2)
include a local loan of US$78.3 million equivalent of which US$71 million is
expected to come from BNDE and the remaining US$7.3 million from PETROBRAS.
D.   Financial Return
21.    Annex 6-4 gives a breakdown of the project's revenue and
cost streams and summarizes the results of the sensitivity tests: the
financial return is 18.6% before and 15% after taxes.

BRAZIL - SERGIPE FERTTTTLER FROJECT
ASSUKPTIONS USED FOR CAIAULATING THE ECONCHIC RATE OF RTURN
1.        In comparison with the financial analysis, several adjustments had
to be made in order to be able to reflect correctly the economic impact of the
project's specific nature. The basic purpose of the Sergipe project is import
substitution of fertilizer. The substitution effect will be of major importance
for Brazil's Center region (states of Sao Paulo and Parana), which is presently
together with the South, the principal importer of fertilizer. However, the
location of plant will be in the state of Sergipe in the Northeast of Brazil. The
basic rationale for such a decision is the objective of making maximum use of
Brazil's natural gas resources. By locating the Sergipe plant directly in
the neighborhood of its future market and feedstock sources in the Northeast,
the output of another ammonia/urea plant located in Camacari, Bahia _ close
to the seaport of Aratu - will be freed and can be shipped to the Center region.
As a result of the plant location in Sergipe, the following implications
arise which penalize the project to a certain degree and which are explained
in further detail in the upcoming paragraphs;
(a) The import substitution effect is slightly diluted in
comparison with other projects insofar as no savings in port handling, and charges
in land transportation cost will be realized;
(b) Comparative transportation situation (basically, shipping
costs against savings in railway transport).
2.        For the calculation of the economic rate of return, a shadow exchange
rate (SER) of 25%1/ is applied to all the local components of the cost and
benefit streams which are expressed in terms of 1976 US dollars.
A.  Capital Costs
3.        TiDue to the fact that the project is 100% exempt from import duties,
the capital costs are the same as used in the financial analysis with the
exception of the adjustments by the shadow exchange rate.
B. Economic Benefits
4.        The economic price of urea is based on its CIF price in Brazil and
derived as follows:
Constant 1976
US$/Ton
FOB Price (bagged)i/                        171
Freight & Insurance                        24
CIF Price                                   196
Less: Bagging Costs                          11

Page 2
5.        The economic price of us$185 per ton urea (bulk) is relatively low.
The reason lies in the specific nature of the project. The practical impact of
the project is - as indicated in paragraph 7.01 - the substitution of overseas
imports of fertilizer by "imports" fram the Northeast to the Central region.
Since the surplus fertilizer of the Northeast will have to be moved by
coastal shipping and land transport to the points of sale in the Center
region, the costs for port handling and inland transportation will be incurred with
or without the Sergipe project and thus cannot be added to the CIF price of
urea.
6.        As in the financial analysis, it is assumed that ammonia and urea
(bulk) will have a long-term price relationship of 1:1.
C. Economic Price of Natural Gas
7.        Since natural gas, which will be used as feedstock is not abundantly
available in the Northeast, the use of gas is restricted to petrochemical
users. Other potential users who could employ it for heating purposes will
have to consume heavy fuel oil (HFO). Therefore, the economic price of
natural gas is assumed to equal the price of heavy fuel oil on a calorific
equivalent. Since Brazil is a net exporter of refined petroleum products,
the economic price for heavy fuel oil as well as for bunker C and vacuum
gas oil are derived by applying the FOB prices. There is no consideration
of port handling charges and transportation cost from the refinery to the
port, because they are minor charges in relation to the total costs and
because the producing refinery of Mataripe is just adjacent to the Bunker
Terminal of the port of Madre de Deus. Since the majority of the important
natural gas consuming industries - which would eventually have to switch to
HFO - are located in the vicinity of Salvador, B3ahia, the transportation costs
of HFO from refinery to the point of consumption can also be disregarded. The
economic gas price is derived as follows:
Constant 1976

D. Fuel Prices
(a) Bunker C Oil
Bunker C is a petroleum fraction with characteristics very similar
t.o those of HFO. However, it is normally traded at a slightly higher price,
since thanks to its higher content of hydrogen, the heating value is
slightly better than the one of heavy fuel oil. An FOB price of US$65 per
ton is assumed. After adjustments for refining and domestic transportation,
the economic price of bunker C comes to US$73 per ton.

(b) Vacuum Gas Oil
9.        Vacuum gas oil is a petroleum fraction, whose density lies between
heavy fuel oil and naphtha. In the recent past, there has been a great
demand in light refining products and due to time-lags in adjustment of
refining capacity, the common price relationship between these three products
bas been distorted. Most likely the present bottleneck situation will be
only of a temporary nature, so one can assume the old long-term price relation-
shinp wlll be restored by the end of the seventies. For the purpose of this
analysis an FOB price of US$80 per ton of vacuum oil is applied which is
the approximate mean between the heavy fuel and the naphtha price. After
adjustments for refining and local transportation, the economic price of
vacuum oil arrives at US$86 per ton.

E. Incremental Transportation Costs
10.       Without the project the fertilizer requirements of the Northeast
would be met by the presently expanded ammonia/urea plant at Camacari
(close to Salvador, Bahia).  After completion of the Sergipe project in



ANNEX 7-1
Page 4
1981, the Northeast will be supplied with fertilizer from Sergipe whereas the
output of the Camacari plant will be shipped via the new port of Aratu to the
Central region. For an estimate of the project's total economic benefits and
costs, it iF therefore necessary to compare the transportation costs by rail-
way between Camacari and Sergipe with the coastal shipping costs from Camacari
to Santos. The resulting comparative transportation costs/benefits have to be
considered in the calculation of the total net benefit stream of the project.
U.        The railway tariffs (Annex 7-2) which took effect in July 1976 are
covering on average only the long-run variable costs of the railway operations
in the Northeast. The variable costs are about 50% of the total costs. Con-
sequently, the railway depends presently on subsidies from the Government
since it is its the explicit goal to maintain the only major railway line in the
Northeast. Without the project in Sergipe, the freight traffic between
Camacari and Sergipe would increase by roughly 100% which would mean consider-
ably higher maintenance costs. Hence, the assumption was made that the long-
run incremental economic costs equal approximately the variable cost plus 50%
of the fixed costs. The resulting rail transport costs are not significantly
different to those for road. The project will also benefit from the inherent
advantages of rail transportation such as reliable and relatively fast trans-
port of goods and efficient product handling.
12.       The incremental coastal shipping costs, which have to be considered
in the case with the project, are assumed to be in constant terms of 1976
US$12 per ton of urea/ammonia in accordance with a study done by PETROBRAS.
The table in Annex 7-3 shows that the project will have to bear a slight
penalty since the coastal shipping costs are not completely compensated by
savings in rail transportation. During the years of full production, about
US$2.0 million per annum in additional transport costs will have to be
absorbed by the economic benefit stream.
13.       The projected annual growth rate of 12% for fertilizer demand in the
Northeast implies that the consumption of urea will exceed the project's out-
put by 1986. The balance will be supplied by the plant at Camacari. The
corresponding quantities will not have to be sent anymore to the Center region
and can be, consequently, regarded as import substitution. However, for the
calculation of a new economic urea price not only port handling charges and in-
land freight but also additional transportation costs from the project's site
to the market area have to be considered. The incremental transport costs are
about the same as the port handling charges and, thus cancel each other out.
Hence, no additional price adjustments had to be made to reflect the situation
of import substitution during the later years of the project's operating life.
F. Economic Rate of Return
14.       Annex 7_4 contains a summary of the economic costs and benefit
streams indicating an economic return of 17% and also gives the results of
the performed sensitivity tests.
