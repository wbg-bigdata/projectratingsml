MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO ALBANIA FOR AN URBAN WORKS
AND MICROENTERPRISE PILOT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Albania for SDR 2.6 million, the equivalent of US$4.0 million, on standard IDA terms with 40 years
maturity, to help finance a project to support urban works and microenterprise development, extending
a successful rural pilot project (Credit 2461-ALB) to urban areas.
2.    Background. Albania's recent emergence from forty-five years of strict central planning and self-
imposed isolation was accompanied by a severe economic crisis. Following the adoption by Government
of a comprehensive program of reforms in mid-1992, the macroeconomic environment has stabilized.
Yet the challenges remain immense. Stabilization will be tentative until the structural transformation of
the economy-the creation of an entirely new privately based economy in place of the centralized system
of the past-is much further advanced. Meanwhile, the necessary macroeconomic and structural reforms
are taking a social toll. It is estimated that over 30 percent of the labor force in urban areas, where 40
percent of Albania's population lives, is unemployed.
3.    Privatization has been rapid in rural areas-nearly all cooperative land and state farm land has
been distributed, creating over 400,000 family farms. The result of land reform and price liberalization
has been a rapid agricultural supply response, with sector growth of 18 percent in 1992, 14 percent in
1993, and nearly 7 percent in 1994. Industry, however, remains in a state of collapse; it will take time
before it is privatized and modernized and able to again absorb a large part of the urban labor force.
Informal private sector growth in urban areas has been significant, but it has not made up for the loss of
employment caused by the collapse of state-owned industries. About 25 percent of the urban labor force
depends on unemployment benefits or economic assistance (ndihmi! ekonomike). In 1994, about US$71
million-16 percent of Albania's budget expenditures-were spent on unemployment compensation and
ndihmc' ekonomike. Clearly, Albania's budget resources are too meager to provide subsidies for an
extended period; a significant change in the socioeconomic situation of people living in urban areas is
necessary. Programs need to be introduced that combine poverty alleviation with economic development
while moving away from pure subsidy programs.
4.     A wide range of private-sector activities are needed in urban areas to replace activities formerly
undertaken by the state and to serve the new market economy.  Many of these services and
products-including bicycle and car repair, home improvement services, small trade, and small
manufacturing-could be provided by small-scale producers. Despite such business opportunities,
however, many potential microentrepreneurs are constrained by lack of credit, business know-how, and
appropriate small-scale technology. A few programs exist to assist small and medium enterprises. The
ORT Human Resources Development Program, financed by USAID, has provided adult training to 3,000
Albanians, particularly ex-political prisoners, since its inception in January 1992. The EU PHARE-
funded SME Development Project was initiated in February 1992 to provide credit (loans average
US$10,000) and business advice to small and medium enterprises.' The IDA-financed Labor Market
Development Project supports a Training, Enterprise, and Employment Fund (TEEF) for adult training
and job-insertion subprojects and creation of small business incubators and small business clubs. There
1/    Average loan size is expected to increase to USS15,000 during the project's second phase (1995-1996).



- 2 -
remains an important need and opportunity, however, to assist microenterprise development, such as self
employment or economic activities requiring less than US$5,000 in investment.
5.     Meanwhile, urban infrastructure--poor to begin with-is deteriorating, thereby providing a further
obstacle to market development, and it is coming under increasing pressure from rural migration. Large
infrastructure projects, such as water supply and sanitation, remain largely the concern of the central
government and are being addressed hy projects such as the IDA-supported Durres Water Supply
Rehabilitation  Project.  In accordance with the Government's policy of decentralization and
deconcentration of central government operations, however, significant economic and administrative
authority is being transferred and delegated to local government, including infrastructure investment and
maintenance.
6.     The June 1992 Law on the Functioning and Administration of Local Government (No. 7572)
reorganized and gave greater powers to local governments, especially to the 44 newly-created
municipalities and 312 communes. There are still many issues of local government and decentralization
to be resolved, including, importantly, local budget and finance.2  While the final outcome of
decentralization is yet to be determined, it is already clear that local government, having no previous
experience in market-economy administration and few resources, is ill-equipped to handle the
responsibilities being transferred and delegated. Most roads and other urban infrastructure are now the
responsibility of districts and newly-created municipalities. Municipalities are not only unprepared to
undertake proper maintenance, but probably unable to address the many new infrastructural needs
associated with privatization and a market economy. Nor can local government be expected to develop
the very innovative local development programs desperately needed to initiate and nurture a private
sector.
7.     Local economic development problems in rural areas are being addressed by the on-going, IDA-
supported Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project (RPAPP-Cr. 2461-ALB), which is expected to close
in 1995, and the follow-up Rural Development Project, which became effective on May 23, 1995. The
Government has requested that a similar program be developed to respond to the serious problems in
urban areas. The proposed five-year Urban Works and Microenterprise Pilot Program involves (a) public
works; (b) small-scale credit and technical and business advice to microentrepreneurs; and (c) studies and
local government training. The Program is being implemented in a phased way as follows:
Phase 1:      Pre-piot phase, underway since February 1994, is testing organiizational and technical
approaches; financing is being provided by a Japanese PHRD grant (US$400,000); the
UNDP (US$100,000); the Fondation pour le Progres de L'Homme, a Swiss foundation
(US$100,000); and Freres d'Esperance, a French NGO (US$13,000). (See para. 10)
Phase 2:      Pdot phase, to be supported by IDA and Government, which would focus on further
testing and designing project components tor two years; activities would be focused in
eight municipalities. This is the project described in this Memorandum.
Phase 3:      Full-scale project, amounting to approximately US$18 million, could be cofinanced by
IDA and other donors if the pilot phase is successful and if external cofinancing is
available. It would extend the project to all urban areas for three additional years.

8.     A Modular Approach. The pilot project and full-scale program  lend themselves easily to a
modular approach, whereby project area and component intensity can be scaled in accordance with
financing resources available.  For example, the pilot project could be expanded if supplemental
cofinancing is secured, as was the case for the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project when supplemental
cofinancing from the Italian Government was used to finance additional project districts.3
9.     Lessons from Previous Bank/lIDA Involvement. The proposed project is based on the successful
experience of the IDA-supported RPAPP, which became effective in April 1993 following six months
of pre-pilot actions funded by the UNDP and a French NGO. An autonomous agency, the Rural
Development Fund, was established by Government to implement the RPAPP's three components-(a)
rural works; (b) small-scale credit; and (c) studies. training, and transfer of technology. The Rural
Development Fund was transformed by Government into the Albanian Development Fund in September
1994. Under the pilot project, operational procedures and mechanisms of technical and financial control
have been developed. Overall, the participatory, process approach has proven an effective method by
which to develop a grassroots, demand-driven project in Albania's transition environment, while
providing for rapid and visible results. The project has demonstrated that local government-communes
and villages-are reliable partners, and that basic project methodology for rural works and small-scale
credit appears effective. Preliminary findings and conclusions of an OED performance audit are highly
positive.4
(a) Rural Works:  As of June 1, 1995, 188 labor-intensive works in 25 districts have been
financed (91 have been completed) at an average cost of US$16,000 per subproject. The
rehabilitated infrastructure-consisting of 86 roads, 24 potable water supplies, 24 schools,
23 health centers, 23 small irrigation schemes, and 8 foot bridges and other-benefits about
300,000 people and represents over 600,000 days of employment.
(b) Small-Scale Credit: A total of 63 village credit funds (VCF) have been established in seven
districts to disburse small loans (average size US$350) for income-generating activity; 3,121
small credits have been granted. Loan recovery, which commenced in November 1993, has
been nearly 100 percent (it has been 100 percent in all but one village)-an achievement
largely attributable to village solidarity and procedures based on local decision making.
About 500 subloans have been repaid, and 1,380 subloans are in the process of being repaid.
(c) Transfer of Technologv: Experimental actions to transfer small-scale technology were started
in late 1993. Three potential agroprocessing demonstration projects were identified, one of
which-a goat cheese production/demonstration unit-is expected to be fully operational in
1995.
10.    Experience under the Pre-Pilot Phase. A pre-pilot phase (US$620,000) is currently underway
under the responsibility of the ADF and is providing important feedback for the proposed pilot project.
Two urban infrastructure works have been carried out-rehabilitation of outdoor markets in Shkoder and
Shijak-and a second phase of the Shkoder market rehabilitation, consisting of building market stalls, has
3/     As of June 1995, the EU Phare is considerinig to finance a U$1O million Local Communities Program, which would
consist of rural and urban works (infrastructure rehabilitation), and which could be implemented by the Albanian
Development Fund.
4/     An OED mission was undertaken from June 6-10, 1994 to evaluate the pilot project prior to the appraisal of the full-scale
project. The PPAR was presented to the Board of Directors in January 1995.

begun. Partial cost recovery of the second phase investment-using taxes collected from the market-is
being tested.  Under the pre-pilot small credit program, 62 small credits have been granted for
microenterprise creation, experimenting with various types of loan guarantee mechanisms.
11.   Project Objectives. The pilot project would help the Government develop a five-year program
to boost employment and small-scale economic activity in urban areas, based on the successful approa-E
of the RPAPP. Objectives of the proposed five-year Urban Works and Microenterprise Program wot .
be: (a) to create employment and stimulate private sector activity in urban areas; (b) to repair basic urban
infrastructure; (c) to promote microenterprises; and (d) to assist local governments obtain the skills they
need for promoting economic development in the long run. The pilot project would test approaches to
the program's implementation during its first two years.
12.    Project Description. The Urban Works and Microenterprise Pilot Project, which would be
implemented over two years, consists of the following components:
(a) Urban Infrastructure Public Works (Base Cost US$1.7 million-41 percent): The pilot
project would finance about 30 public works, which would be focused in six municipalities.
Works would be demand driven, presented for ADF evaluation and approval by municipality
authorities according to the needs of the local population and within a framework of criteria
defined by the project. Subprojects, which would only involve infrastructure under the
responsibility of the municipality, could include: rehabilitating market facilities, cleaning city
waterways, rehabilitating public buildings (such as schools and hospitals), repairing
municipality roads and sidewalks, preparing sites and services for squatter settlements,
planting trees and urban landscaping, and constructing garbage shelters. Works would be
carried out by private contractors selected by municipalities using national shopping, with the
assistance and oversight of the ADF. A few type of works that require mainly manual labor
(such as grading or cleaning riverbanks) could be undertaken by municipalities, which would
directly hire unemployed or disadvantaged workers. Subproject cost would range from
US$10,000 to US$150,000, and is expected to average US$48,000 during PYI and
US$63,000 in PY2.
(b) Small-Scale Credit and Microenterprise Support (Base Cost US$1.8 million-43 percent):
The pilot project would develop and test urban microenterprise lending, building a credit
delivery system that combines poverty alleviation with economic growth on a progressively
sustainable basis. During the project period, about 2,000 small loans would be granted in
five municipalities for income-generating activity, assisting potential microentrepreneurs who
are unemployed or receiving social assistance and who have difficulty in accessing banks.
Potential microbusiness activities to be financed include: small trade, small businesses
(pharmacies, bakeries), services (repairing of television sets, bicycles, etc.), artisanal
production of all types (soap, candles, furniture, sweets, tailoring, shoe making), and basic
construction and rehabilitation. Special attention would be given to opportunities for women.
Loans, which would be denominated in lek and would normally range from US$300 to
US$5,000 equivalent with an absolute maximum of US$10,000 equivalent, are expected to
average about US$2,000, and interest would be in line with commercial rates.5 Loan
duration, which would vary according to the activity financed, would be expected to average
nine months.  Guarantee mechanisms to be tested include solidarity groups, notarized
contracts (currently practiced for some types of informal lending), and character referrals.
5/     During the pre-pilot phase, the annual interest mte has been 24 percent.

Business and technical advice would be made available to microentrepreneurs by the credit
team, with the possible support of local consultants. In addition, a small "innovation fund"
would be established to help create about five model microenterprises in key subsectors, such
as textiles, wood processing, metal processing, and carpet production. These demonstration
projects, which would be initiated by private entrepreneurs, would transfer small technology
and new forms of supply, production, and marketing. Other support actions to be financed
under the component are training, market and technical studies, and a microenterprise data
base and information center.
(c) Studies and Training (Base Cost US$0. 1 million-3 percent): Municipalities are unprepared
to address basic urban infrastructure needs, much less to develop the innovative programs
needed for long-run economic development. Assistance and training would be provided to
municipalities to develop skills in local development, and the project would provide seed
money to initiate professional exchanges in order to provide rapid exposure to local
development practices that have proven successful elsewhere. Also, beneficiary assessment
studies would be funded under this component to evaluate project impact.
(e) Implementation Support (Base Cost US$ 0.6 million-13 percent): The pilot project would
support program implementation by financing the project-related operating costs of the
Albanian Development Fund, and by strengthening ADF administration and management
through training and technical assistance.  Operational procedures and mechanisms of
technical and financial control for the project would be further refined during the pilot phase.
13.    Methodology. The project would adopt a participatory, process approach like that of the RPAPP.
It would be built from the bottom up, first identifying the needs and constraints of the municipalities and
potential microentrepreneurs, then working with them to develop methods and procedures. Project
activities would be adjusted continually according to feedback and results.
14.    Pilot Project Area. Project activities would be focused in eight municipalities: Berat, Elbasari,
Gramsh, Kavaje, Peqin, Shijak (Durres District), Shkoder, and Tirana (see map). Pilot municipalities,
which must be accessible from Tirana to permit efficient use of pilot project resources, have been selected
taking into consideration variety (of size and region), microenterprise development potential, and
unemployment and economic assistance per capita.   Urban works would  be focused  in six
municipalities-Berat, Elbasan, Gramsh, Kavaje, Peqin, and Shkoder-although works may also be
undertaken in smaller towns located in the same districts. The small-scale credit and microenterprise
support component would focus its activities in Berat, Kavaje, Shijak, Shkoder, and Tirana.
15.    Project Implementation. The proposed project would be carried out by the Albanian Development
Fund, which was established by the Council of Ministers (Government Decision 427, September 8, 1994)
to operate in rural and urban areas as the successor to the Rural Development Fund (FDF).6 This
transformation has been accompanied by a change in the internal organization of the institution, as well
as strengthening of its financial and administrative capacity. Under the RPAPP, the ADF has proven its
ability to implement project components effectively and efficiently. A mid-term review would be carried
out after approximately 12 months to adjust project components and design the full-scale program.
6/     The RDF was established by Govemment Decision No. 12 (Januaiy 9, 1993). The RDF was transformed into the ADF
in order to extend project activities to urban areas.



- 6 -
16.   The project cost is estimated at US$4.4 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$1.2
million equivalent. The Bank would finance US$4.0 million equivalent, 91 percent of the total project
costs. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods
of procurement and of disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in the Albania are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
13410-ALB dated June 30, 1995, is being distributed separately.
17.   Project Sustainability. The Albanian Development Fund is intended as a transitional-rather than
a sustainable-institution, and project components would be expected each to evolve differently. Small
infrastructure rehabilitation would be eventually organized directly by municipalities and financed by their
investment budgets, and the urban credit component could become over time a special program for
commercial banks, providing intermediation for the smallest borrowers.
18.   Rationale for Bank Involvement. The proposed project closely reflects the development priorities
formulated in the Country Assistance Strategy for Albania, as discussed by the Board in August 1993:
the project would promote new entrepreneurship and private initiative, and would promote stability by
providing immediate and visible results. The project would complement on-going IDA-financed projects
in Albania. It would provide an urban counterpart to the Rural Development Project, and linkages could
be established between the two projects. Main IDA-supported projects address structural change at the
national level (such as the Agriculture Sector Adjustment Credit, the Social Safety Net Development
Project, and the Labor Market Development Project) or major infrastructure needs (such as the Transport
Project, the Housing Project, the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, the Durres Water Supply Project, and
the Rural Roads Project). The proposed Urban Works and Microenterprise Pilot Program would provide
an interim approach for dealing with a serious employment and poverty problem in the urban areas while
providing time for longer-term, sustainable measures to take root.
19.   Agreements Reached. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government and
ADF on the following:
(a) ADF would employ, until project completion, an executive director whose experience and
qualifications would be at all times acceptable to IDA, and would consult with IDA with
respect to the replacement of the executive director prior to any such replacement;
(b) ADF would carry out project activities in accordance with Operational Guidelines acceptable
to IDA, and any changes in the Operational Guidelines would only be made in consultation
with, and with the approval of, IDA;
(c) By November 30 of each year, ADF would prepare and submit to IDA for review work plans
and budgets for project activities, which would include specific proposals for the use of
Government's contribution;
(d) Each microenterprise subproject to be supported under the "innovation fund" would be
submitted to IDA tor prior approval;
(e) ADF would take all measures to ensure that individual subloans under the small credit
program would not exceed US$10,000 equivalent, and that individual subloans under the
"innovation fund" would not exceed US$15,000 equivalent;



- 7 -
(f) The ADF would maintain accounting practices acceptable to IDA, including satisfactory
provisions for periodic reporting, and an annual audit would be undertaken by independent
auditors acceptable to IDA;
(g) The ADF would submit to IDA quarterly reports in a format acceptable to IDA on the
progress and execution of the project;
(h) the ADF would undertake a mid-term evaluation of the project no later than September 30,
1996 for the purpose of adjusting pilot project activities and designing the full-scale project.
20.    Conditions of Effectiveness. Approval of Operational Guidelines by the ADF satisfactory to IDA
and execution of a subsidiary agreement acceptable to IDA between the Ministry of Finance and the ADF
would be conditions of effectiveness.
21.   Environmental Aspects. In accordance with Operational Directive 4.01, the project has been
assigned to environmental screening category "B." The small scale of project activities makes any
significant negative environmental impact unlikely. Some public works could have an environmental
focus. Environmental guidelines and checklists for rural works developed under the RPAPP would be
adapted for urban infrastructure subprojects.
22.    Program Objective Categories. Although not all project components contain specific mechanisms
for targeting the least well off, it is expected, given the nature of the project and its components, that the
population of project beneficiaries would have a larger proportion of poor people than the population as
a whole. Consequently, the project would be rated as "Poverty Category: Program for Targeted
Interventions" in accordance with the provisions of OD 4.15.
23.   Participatory Approach. The project emphasizes the same participatory and process (phased)
approach used for the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project. Mechanisms and systems for small
infrastructure rehabilitation, credit delivery, and microenterprise support would be worked out and tested
in continuous dialogue with the stakeholders-local government, potential microentrepreneurs, and
borrowers. By starting small, feedback would be easily incorporated into project design, and continued
participation would be used to adjust project activities and methods as necessary.
24.   Project Benefits. Given the pilot nature of this project, the type of the investments proposed and
the project design, a conventional economic analysis is not meaningful. However, a methodology to
confirm efficient use of funds would he tested during the pilot project. In the meantime, urban works
will be selected on basis of criteria designed to meet priority needs of communities. Subloans for
microentrepreneurs will be required to have viable financial cashflows with market interest rates
(currently 20%). Direct and immediate benefits would flow from the labor-intensive public works, which
would inject cash resources into the urban economy and create over 5,000 months of employment, and
the small loans, which would allow potential microentrepreneurs to undertake income-generating
activities. Improved urban infrastructure would help provide an environment conducive to increased trade
and market activity. By focusing on microenterprise development, the project would boost market
activities in urban areas, while benefiting the most needy. The demonstration projects initiated by private
entrepreneurs would introduce practical, sustainable models of microenterprises that are widely replicable
and would promote new forms of marketing through creation of marketing networks with the foreign
private sector. The project would also provide the framework for improved long-term local development
and planning by municipalities.

25.   Risks. Potential risks include deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and political
interference. Political risks would be minimized by paying special attention to the establishment and use
of written operational guidelines. The development of an appropriate mechanism for credit delivery
would be critical to the component's success; careful follow-up monitoring of the credit program would
be undertaken to mitigate design and repayment risks. Project implementation capacity is considered
adequate given the experience under the RPAPP. Project-specific risk should be minimized because the
project would be built with the full participation of local authorities and the beneficiaries themselves.
Moreover, the process approach provides for continuous adjustment of the program in accordance with
local needs and constraints, as long as project feedback is effectively incorporated.
26.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
