PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NORTHEAST POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (LOAN 1300-BR)
Preface
1.        This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Northeast Power
Distributton Project, which was partially financed by Loan 1300-BR (US$50.0
million equivalent). The borrower was Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras, S.A.
(ELETROBRAS), which reloaned all but a small part of the proceeds to the
distribution companies serving the states of Bahia, Pernambuco, and Ceara.
The PCR was prepared by the Energy Division of the Latin America and
Caribbean Regional Office based on information in the Bank files, final
project reports prepared by the borrower and the beneficiaries, and
discussions with staff of the Bank, the borrower, and the beneficiaries.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluations Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft PCR
to the Government, the Borrower and Executing Agencies. The comments received
from ELETROBRAS expressing concurrence with the findings of the completion
report are attached.

Improvement
1/ As ELETROSRAS provided only Bank-ftnanced foreign-cost data on the actual
cost of sub-Project D. the appraisal-cost estimatce has been
correspondingly adjusted to reflect only the estimat of Bank-financed
foreign costs. The appraisal estimate of foreign currency cost expected
to be financed by ELETROURAS amounted to USSO.70 milLion *nd the estimte
of local currency coats amounted to USS0.46 million thereby bringtig the
total appraisal cost eutimte for the Project to USSI45.34 million.
2/  Actual and appraissl cost data are not fully comparable. given the
substantial changes to the Project (para.3.2.4-3.2.9).
3/ Exchange adjustmnt Eavorable to the borrower: USS8.66 million.
t/  Except for one transmission  tine, all project components were completed
by December 1982 (pars.3.2.5). The delayed completion reflected a late
start of physical execution of the Project (par-.3. Z2). the
unfamiliarity of the benficiaries wvth Dank procedures (pra.3..2.3). and
changes to the Project (paras.3.2.4-3.2.9). The transmiasLon line will
be completed tn 1985.
S/ Less-than-expetcd level of actual returns reflects: (i) coer overruns
(paras.3.4.2); (ti) tariffs set at levele below the mrginal cost of
supply (para.4.3.1); and (iLL) expected implemntation of the current
agreemnt between Dank and Brailan power authorities.  This agremnt
requiree ralsing tariffs to prmict 12 annual Lncreas in sector rate of
remuneration until a 10S rate of remuneration is achieved (pars. 5.2.4).
Appraisal returns reflect assumption that marginal operating costs would
amount to six percent of costs of investment program; actual returns differ
bv being based on actual marginal operating costs.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
NORTHEAST POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (LOAN 1300-BR)
Highlights
1.        The project was successful in obtaining its objectives   D
supporting the Government's accelerated development effort in the Northeast,
aiding low-income consumers, strengthening the financial management and
planning capabilities of the beneficiaries, and diversifying geographically
the Bank's power lending effort in Brazil.
2.        This success materialized inspite of substantial delay
characterizing the processing and implementation of a comparatively complex
transmission/distribution project. In order to process the proposed Project,
the Bank needed decisions which were slow in coming from Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras, S.A. (ELETROBRAS) and various agencies of the Brazilian
Government; it took almost two years of preparation before appraisal could
occur. ELETROBRAS now has the capacity, formerly lacking, to process
transmission/distribution projects.
3.        Implementation of the Project started almost a year late because of
slow decision-making by the Government concerning incentives to be offered
local manufacturers. Staff of ELETROBRAS felt that there was no action
available to the Bank which could have avoided this delay. Further delay
occurred because of changes to the scope of the Project, to which the Bank
agreed.
4.        The declining financial performance of the power sector during the
period 1976-1982 was the central subject of dialogue between Brazilian power
authorities and Bank staff. To address this situation, the Bank and the
Government negotiated in 1981 an agreement on tariff increases for the sector
which superceded existing revenue covenants. This agreement represented an
easing of revenue targets as originally covenanted. In 1983, the Bank and
the Government negotiated a new agreement which specified realistic
rate-of-remuneration targets. The sector has complied with the terms of
these two agreements.
5.        By holding down tariffs, the Government has weakened the sector
which has also been affected by the recession and sequences of devaluation
that occurred in recent years. Despite this development, the Brazilian power
sector continues to be well managed, with a better than average performance
in satisfying an extremely rapid market growth, and with good investment
planning.



BRAZIL
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS BRASILEIRAS, S.A. (ELETROBRAS)
NORTHEAST POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT (LOAN 1300-BR)
I. BACKGROUND
1.1 Bank Participation in Sector Financing
1.1.1       Since 1949, the Bank has made 38 loans to the power sector of
Brazil, amounting to US$2.35 billion equivalent. Prior to 1976, most Bank
loans helped to finance the construction of hydroelectric plants and
associated transmission facilities in the Southeastern and Southern regions.
1.1.2       Since 1976, there has been a reorientation of Bank lending to
support distribution projects in all regions of Brazil. In connection with
such projects, the Bank has provided the power sector with eleven loans,
amounting to USS1.37 billion, including six loans to Centrais Eletricas
Brasileiras, S.A. (ELETROBRAS), amounting to US$0.87 billion (Annex 1.1). In
all cases but one, proceeds of the loans to ELETROBRAS have been reloaned to
state power companies to help support their distribution and rural
electrification expansion progrA  .  The exception was a loan to finance the
purchase of supervision and control equipment currently being installed at
ELETROBRAS and at interconnected companies (federal and state) with major
generating plants.   This loan also helped to finance studies of the marginal
cost of electricity supply. Currently, the efforts of the Bank are centered
on assisting the sector to improve its finances.
1.1.3       The first Bank loan to ELETROBRAS (1300-BR; US$50.0 million;
1976) has helped to finance the Northeast Distribution Project, the subject
of this report. ELETROBRAS reloaned the bulk of the proceeds of Loan 1300-BR
to the state power companies of Bahia, Pernambuco, and Ceara-Companhia de
Eletricidade do Estado da Bahia (COELBA), Companhia de Eletricidade de
Pernambuco (CELPE), and Companhia de Eletricidade do Ceara (COELCE). These
loans helped to support the expansion, extension, and rehabilitation of their
respective transmission/distribution systems. ELETROBRAS employed a modest
portion of the proceeds of the loan for training and various consulting
services.
1.1.4       The second Bank loan to ELETROBRAS (1538-BR; US$130.0 million;
1978) has been benefitting three state power companies which have been
expanding their distribution systems. While completion of the substation
component of this project has been delayed four years to December 1985
because of lagging demand and concomitant project revisions, no cost overrun
is expected. The third Bank loan to ELETROBRAS (1939-BR; US$32.0 million;
1981) has been helping to finance the purchase and installation of
supervision and control equipment (para. 1.1.2). This project is expected to
be completed two years late (June 1987) due to procurement, managerial, and



-2-
counterpart funding problems; but, again, no cost overrun is expected. The
remaining loans to ELETROBRAS have been helping to support the distribution
programs of other state power companies. Two of these projects are facing
delays because of counterpart funding difficulties. Annex 1.1 sets forth
details on Bank loans to ELETROBRAS.
1.1.5       In addition to helping with the financing of generation,
transmission, and distribution works, Bank participation in the power sector
has also contributed to the efforts of Brazilian authorities to improve
sector organization and planning (see Project Completion Report on the Salto
Osorio Project, dated March 19, 1979). Bank participation has also
facilitated access to foreign financing (commercial and bilateral)
benefitting the power sector. For example, the Itumbiara hydroelectric
project (Loan 923-BR) benefitted from such financing. The sectoral roles of
ELETROBRAS, its operating companies, and the state power companies are
discussed below.
1.2 Sector Organization
1.2.1       The Brazilian power sector has evolved into a relatively compact
structure of federal and state utilities. Decree No. b8,024 of June 7, 1967
established the legal, technical, and administrative structure of the power
sector and defined the structure as consisting of the National Department of
Water and Electric Energy (DNAEE), ELETROBRAS, and the various federal,
state, municipal and private concessionaires, all under the jurisdiction of
the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME).
1.2.2        DNAEE has been performing regulatory functions, including the
granting of licenses for hydroelectric sites, assigning concession areas,
setting tariffs, and approving sector expansion plans. Since 1981, the
authority of DNAEE to set tariffs and approve expansion plans has been
reduced by the effective transfer of final authority to the Secretariat of
Planning (SEPLAN), which has been reviewing and approving tariff increases
and invest,nent plans within a broader policy context.
1.2.3        ELETROBRAS is a mixed economy corporation, whose principal
shareholder is the Government of Brazil. ELETROBRAS has been performing the
functions of: (a) utility holding company for those power utilities where the
Government has acquired financial control; (b) investment banker by
administering public funds for use by its subsidiaries and by state power
companies; and (c) coordinator of the external borro,iing efforts of the
individual power companies. ELETROBRAS has also been carrying out a planning
function for generation and transmission companies and is responsible for the
development and periodic updating of a national master plan. It also has an
operational co-ordination function through the Co-ordinating Groups for
Interconnected Operations (GCOI's). Operating on a regional basis--one for
the South-southeast and one for the Northeast-the GCOI's are charged with
the responsibility for the most efficient operation of interconnected
generating plants and transmission systems.
1.2.4       At the operating level, the sector consists of federal, state,
municipal, and private concessionaires. Since 1974, in accordance with



3
Government policy, construction and operation of major new power generating
facilities and related high voltage transmission systems are reserved largely
to four ELETROBRAS subsidiaries which cover Brazil's five geo-economic
regions. These companies are Centrais Eletricas do Norte do Brasil
(ELETRONORTE), Companhia Hidro Eletrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF), Furnas
Centrais Eletricas (FURNAS), and Centrais Eletricas do Sul do Brasil
(ELETROSUL). ELETROBRAS has been investing in distribution companies; but
the distribution function is carried out at the state level mainly by
utilities controlled by state governments.
1.3 The Beneficiaries of Loan 1330-BR
1.3.1       Since their respective creations in 1960, 1968, and 1971, COELBA,
CELPE, and COELCE. have been planning, building, and operating their
respective systems (primarily sub-transmission and distribution networks);
and have been substituting power generated by the CHESF interconnected system
for the power which was formerly generated by their own small plants (mainly
diesel). In their respective states, they have been practically the sole
concessionaires, though CHESF also supplies power to major industries
connected to the 230kV network. Some small municipalities retail power
supplied to them by the beneficiaries. COELBA, CELPE, and COELCE are stock
corporations, the main shareholders being the governments of their respective
states (para. 1.1.3).

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1 Origin and Rationale for the Project
2.1.1     The Northeast Distribution Project had its origin in preliminary
discussions (January-February 1974) between CHESF and Bank staff concerning
the possibility of a Bank loan to CHESF to expand the distribution network in
the states of Bahia, Pernambuco, and Ceara, where coverage was comparatively
low-about 27X. The proceeds of the possible loan would be reloaned to
individual state power companies for rural and urban (low-income)
distribution expansion.
2.1.2     However, as these arrangements would have been inconsistent with
the roles assigned to CHESF (construction and operation of generating plants
and high voltage transmission networks networks - para 1.2.4), CHESF withdrew
from preparations for the proposed distribution project, its place being
taken by ELETROBRAS. To proceed with the proposed project, the Bank needed
dcisions from ELETROBRAS and from technical agencies of the Government.
These decisions were slow in coming, as ELETROBRAS had only limited
capability for evaluating distribution projects and as the technical agencies
had to agree on uniform distribution standards. Subsequent processing of the
proposed project to Board presentation took more than two years.
2.1.3     Concerning its role in relation to the proposed project, ELETROBRAS
felt (May 1974) that it would be unable to provide supervision because of
other commitments, but that it would act as a conduit through which Bank
funds would be channelled to state power companies. A visit by Bank and
ELETROBRAS staff to COELCE, COELBA, and CELPE identified elements of an urban
distribution project suitable for Bank lending--namely, additions, expansion
and rehabilitation of the low and mid-tension networks in major cities and
around nearby towns and villages (in effect, the normal expansion program);
and the connection of low-income urban households. To avoid duplication of
and interference with existing rural electrification efforts financed by the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the Bank decided not to participate in
rural electrification.
2.1.4     In addition to the normal technical and economic benefits, the
proposed Project, from the point of the Bank, offered other advantages: (1)
support of the Government's accelerated development effort in behalf of the
impoverished Northeast; (2) geographic diversification of the Bank's power
lending (para. 1.1.1); and (3) substantial social benefits, especially the
component aiding low-income urban consumers. Further, the proposed Project
would complement the generation and transmission program of CHESF, which the
Bank was helping to finance with Loan 1008-BR; and would provide an
opportunity for strengthening the financial management and planning
capabilities of the beneficiaries.
2.2 Project Preparation and Appraisal
2.2.1     Bank preparation and appraisal missions (November 1984; June,
August, and November, 1975) focused on the issues of project definition,



-5-
project cost, loan size, procurement arrangements, implementation periods,
uniform distribution standards, and financing schemes for the low-income
component. After lengthy discussions, staff of the Bank, ELETROBRAS, and the
beneficiaries agreed that the proposed Project would include works
constituting the major portions of the normal sub-transmission and
distribution expansion programs of the beneficiaries for the period June 1976
- December 1979. These future works would consist of lines and substations
(at 138 kV to 13.8 kV, plus low tension) and the installation of
miscellaneous control equipment and 309,400 meters (including 41,000 meters
for low-income customers). COELBA, CELPA and COELCE would carry out
sub-projects denominated a.i Parts A, B and C of the project.
2.2.2     Based on initial conversations with the proposed beneficiaries
(November 1974), Bank staff expected that the iow-income consumers would
reimburse the power companies for all the costs of connection and interior
wiring through low monthly installment payments. But later (April-May 1975),
based on revised market data showing that the fi.iancing capacity of
low-income consumers was more limited than expected--only 45,000 customers of
a potential low-income consumers pool of 156,000 could afford the expected
cost of US$44.34 per connection and of US$27.86 per interior wiring- Bank
staff proposed exempting the low-income consumers from repaying the cost of
connection. It was expected that the cost of connection would be added to
the rate base for tariff-making purposes. Bank staff also proposed
eliminating from Bank financing the cost of materials and equipment used for
interior wiring. This cost would still be repaid by the low-income consumers
through low monthly installment payments. It was hoped that these proposals
(which the beneficiaries accepted) would lead to a substantial increase in
the number of low-income consumers availing themselves of connections; but
at appraisal, the number of low-income consumers expected was estimated at a
conservative level: only 41,000.
2.2.3     The proposed Project would also include studies, training and
technical assistance for procurement denominated as Part D. ELETROBRAS would
carry out Part D. For the beneficiaries there would be local training
organized by ELETROBRAS in the areas of public utility management; and there
would be consultant services for the procurement process to assist the
beneficiaries wbo iqre unfamiliar with the Bank guidelines for procurement.
2.2.4     Of interest to the sector, there would be overseas training of
DNAEE staff in the areas of tariff and regulatory policies and a
DNAEE-supervised tariff study to determine whether the level and structure of
tariffs ensured for the sector an appropriate balance of social, financial,
and economic objectives. For ELETROBRAS, there would be consultant services
to determine system extension criteria and lower-cost technical standards for
distribution facilities in low-density areas.
2.2.5     It was expected that the Project would cest about US$145.3 million
(foreign cost: US$50.5 million) and wouled be allocated among the



-6-
beneficiaries as follows: COELBA, US$66.4 million; CELPE, US$50.4 million;
COELCE, US$27.0 million; and ELETROBRAS, US$1.5 million. It was also
expected that a proposed Bank loan of USS50.0 million would cover the direct
and indirect foreign cost of training, studies, and material/equipment
requirements of the Project, including the cost of connecting low-income
consumers. It was expected that procurement consultants (para. 2.2.3) would
carry out their function according to the Bankts guidelines for procurement.
2.3 Negotiations, Presentation and Effectiveness
2.3.1     No problems delayed negotiations (April 19-24, 1976).  Board
approval occurred on June 24, 1976; representatives of the Bank, ELETROBRAS,
COELBA, CELPE and COELCE, and the national and state governments signed Loan,
Project, Shareholder and Guarantee Agreements on August 27, 1976. Loan
1300-BR amounted to US$50.0 million; the term was 20 years, including 3-1/2
years grace. The interest rate was 8.85%; the commitment fee, 3/4 of 1%.
Effectiveness of the Loan Agreement was delayed to January 31, 1977 because
of slow action on the part of the Government in providing a legal opinion.
As discussed in the next chapter, this delay was not a major factor in the
late start of physical execution of the Project. Other factors were more
important.
2.4 Major Covenants of the Loan, Guarantee,
P-roject, and Shareholder Agreements
2.4.1     Annex 2.1 sets forth major covenants of the Loan, Guarantee,
Project, and Shareholder Agreements. Brazilian authorities complied with
their respective major covenants, except in the areas of tariffs and
revenues. After 1977, Government tariff decisions resulted in low revenue
levels for the beneficiaries and non-compliance with respect to their
covenanted rate of remuneration 1/. Chapter 5 sets forth details on the
tariff policy of the Government and its impact on the finances of the sector
and the beneficiaries.
1/  Under Brazilian legislation, the remunerable rate base includes elements
either different from or additional to those defined in           Bank loan
agreements for power projects. Those elements include: (i) average net
fixed assets in operation established on a time weighted basis (rather
than an arithmetic average based on values at the beginning and end of
the year); (ii) an allowance for working capital; and (iii) the
accumulated revenue shortfall of prior years.

III. PROJECT EXECUTION AND COST
3.1 Actual and Forecast Data on Project Execution and Cost
3.1.1     Annexes 3.0 to 3.2 compare actual and forecast completed works and
completion dates for components of sub-projects A, B, and C. Annex 3.3 sets
forth the deflation factors for converting current costs of the sub-project
into constant costs.  Annexes 3.4 to 3.6 compare actual and forecast costs of
the sub-projects. Annexes 3.7 and 3.8 compare, respectively, actual and
forecast allocations of the loan proceeds and actual and forecast annual
disbursements. The following paragraphs discuss the information contained in
the above annexes.
3.2 Timetable, Changes, and Supervision: Parts A, B and C
3.2.1     Physical execution of the transmission/distribution works
constituting Parts A, B and C of the project (para. 2.2.1) began in October
1977, about nine months late. CELPE completed its sub-project, Part B, by
December 1981. COELCE completed its sub-project Part C, by September 1982.
COELBA completed almost all of its sub-project, Part A, by December 1982.
Certain transmission lines at 69 kV were not completed until July 1983; and
the Governador Mangabeira-Tomba line (at 220 kV) will not be completed until
1985. For purposes of this report, December 1982 is considered to be the
date of project completion, except as otherwise noted.
3.2.2     The major factor contributing to delayed initial project execution
of Parts A, B, and C was the late decision (April 1977) by the Government to
grant fiscal incentives to local manufacturers to participate in
international competitive bidding for goods to be procured from the proceeds
of the Bank loan.  A Bank supervision mission (December 1976) estimated that
the late Government decision would delay by about nine months (from November
1976 to May 1977) the initial placement of equipment orders and would lead to
a corresponding delay of initial physical execution. Staff of ELETROBRAS and
the beneficiaries later expressed the opinion that, because the timing of the
Government decision depended upon the reconciliation of competing local
interests, there was nothing which Bank staff might have done to avoid the
problem through anticipatory action; or to accelerate the timetable of
solution.
3.2.3     Also contributing to the initial delay but of lesser importance
than the late Government decision was the general unfamiliarity of the
beneficiaries with the preparation of technical specifications and with
complying with the various procedural requirements established by the World
Bank. In the course of project execution, the beneficiaries became familiar
and adept in both of these areas. These improvements occurred with the
administrative support provided by ELETROBRAS and through the self-help
efforts of the beneficiaries with the assistance of Bank staff involved in
supervision of the Project.
3.2.4     The late completion date of the Project (December 1982 as compared
with the completion date expected at appraisal, December 1979) was due to a
variety of factors, the most important of which were the late initial start



- 8 -
of physical execution and the subsequent decisions of the beneficiaries to
change, with Bank agreement, various sub-categories of the Project (through
additions, deletions, and substitutions). These changes had the effect of
increasing the scope of the distribution portion of the Project, of requiring
redesign of some works, of rearranging construction priorities, and of adding
to the construction period needed to complete the Project. Also contributing
to the late completion date for the Project were such problems as the late
delivery of equipment, the delivery of damaged equipment, delays in obtaining
rights of way, etc.
3.2.5     The delay to the sub-Project of COELBA, the largest of the three
sub-Projects, had its origin in the decision (taken in 1976-1977 after
appraisal) of the federal power company, CHESF, to build its own transmission
line (220 kV; 615 km) to serve the western part of the concession area of
COELBA. Because of this decision, COELBA eliminated the proposed 138 kV
transmission line (Jequie-Igapora) from the Project with the agreement of the
Bank. The Bank then reallocated the proceeds of the loan originally
dedicated to the Jequie-Igapora line to other components of ODELBA's
expansion program not originally included in the Project. The most important
additions to COELBA's sub-Project were the 138 kV transmission lines,
Brumado-Victoria de Conquista (120 km) and Ilheus-Funil (66 km); and an
increase in the transformer capacity of 138/69 kV substations (from 47.5 to
87.5 MVA). Further transformer capacity was added in 1982. The final
element of Part A, the transmission line at 220 kV between Hangabeira and
Tomba (about 49 km), will be completed in 1985. Problems of ownership,
design, and funding have delayed completion of this element.
3.2.6     Most of the changes to the Project reflected the findings of
studies carried out by the beneficiaries, which showed the markets of the
individual beneficiaries growing in patterns different from those anticipated
at appraisal. The extent of these changes should not be considered unusual,
as heterogeneous transmission/distribution projects must be flexibly
implemented to adapt to evolving market developments. Further, there is no
obvious method for differentiating Project and non-project works if they are
connected. The changes featured substantial increases in distribution
transformer capacity and large additions to the distribution network (lines)
at 13.8 kV and at low tension. There were substantial increases in consumer
connections over the level expected at appraisal.
3.2.7     While the volume of actually completed distribution works surpassed
substantially that which was expected at appraisal, construction of
transmission lines at 138 kV (as measured in km) was less than expected. The
construction of transmission lines at 69 kV surpassed that which was expected
at appraisal.
3.2.8     The table below summarizes Annexes 3.0 - 3.2; and compares actual
and forecast works completed by December 1982:

3.2.9     Between December 1976 and July 1981, Bank staff carried out several
technical supervision missions of the transmission/distribution works
constituting the various sub-Projects. Bank staff took an understanding view
of the initial delays to Project execution (para. 3.1.1). By stimulating
action to correct design flaws of the 69 kV sub-stations, Bank staff
contributed to successful implementation of the sub-Projects of COELCE and
CELPE; and Bank staff contributed to project implementation with quick action
on requested Project changes. As discussed in Chapter 5, the major focus of
Bank supervision related to remedying the financing difficulties of the
sector.
3.3 Timetable, Changes and Supervision: Part D
3.3.1     ELETROBRAS was responsible for the execution of Part D of the
Project, which consisted of training, studies, and technical assistance for
procurement. Consultants provided satisfactory assistance in: (i) the area
of procurement (para. 2.2.3); and (ii) the preparation of a tariff structure
study based on the concept of long-run marginal cost of supply. The



- 10 -
preliminary draft of this study was sent to the Bank in March 1979, about 15
months late. The final version of this study served as the basis for
additional tariff structure studies financed by other Bank loans (1824-BR and
1939-BR). These studies have resulted in tariff structure changes which are
being introduced progressively. Marginal cost-based tariffs are available on
an optional basis to about 500 high-voltage (69 kV and above) customers.
About a quarter of this group has taken advantage of the new tariffs which
contain seasonal and hourly features. Because of the expense associated with
special metering equipment, the new tariffs are being extended to medium
voltage customers (69 kV to 13.8 kV) at a slow rate.
3.3.2     Part D also included a study to determine nationwide standards for
service extensions and a study to lower the cost of extending rural networks.
The Bank agreed to eliminate the study to determine the nationwide standards
for service extensions on the grounds that the diversity of development among
the various geoeconomic regions of Brazil rendered impossible the
establishment of such standards. In 1981 (about three years late),
ELETROBRAS, together with other power companies, completed studies which,
according to ELETROBRAS, led to a reduction (24.4% or US$1,300) of the per
kilometer cost of extending rural electrification systems.
3.3.3     Under the training component of Part D, ELETROBRAS provided
extensive administrative support to CELPE and COELCE to improve their
financial departments. In general, the Bank was satisfied with the
improvements to the financial planning and management information systems;
and urged action which is resulting in the implementation of improved
internal control systems. ELETROBRAS also maintained a training program for
staff of other sector entities. By August 1982, some 91 individuals had
benefitted from training provided by ELETROBRAS with the costs of such
training partially or fully funded from the proceeds of Loan 1300-BR. Under
other Bank loans, Baik staff assessed favorably the training program of
ELETROBRAS.
3.3.4     The training programs of COELBA and CELPE benefitting from funding
under Loan 1300-BR consisted of foreign training for a small number of
engineers and some modest purchases of equipment. COELCE's Bank-funded
training program consisted of equipment purchases only. ELETROBRAS did not
participate in the preparation of the training programs of the beneficiaries,
which Bank staff reviewed at the planning stage.   Subsequently, Bank staff
monitored their late implementation, which was carried out without the
benefit of the supervision of ELETROBRAS.
3.4 Project Costs
3.4.1     Through 1982, expenditures for the Project amounted to almost $193
million, or 33% greater than the cost estimate prepared at appraisal.
ELETROBRAS expects that by 1985, COELBA will have spent an additional US$11.0
million to complete its sub-Project (para. 3.1.1), thereby bringing the total
cost of the Project to about US$204.0 million, or 41% greater than the
appraisal cost estimate.

a/ Actual cost data supplied by ELETROBRAS for its part of the project
reflected only disbursements from Loan 1300-BR -- that is, actual cost
data did not include information on costs covered by ELETROBRAS. To make
actual and forecast costs comparable, the appraisal cost estimate has
been altered to exclude costs (US$1.16 million) which were expected to be
covered by ELETROBRAS.
b/ A reallocation of the proceeds of Loan 1300-BR to reflect expenditure for
training by beneficiary would reduce the project cost attributed to
ELETROBRAS by US$0.36 million and increase the costs of COELBA, CELPE,
and COELCE by US$0.22 million, US$0.06 million, and US$0.08 million
respectively.
3.4.3     The above cost comparison is not a fully meaningful exercise
because of changes which enlarged the scope of the Project, especially the
distribution component, and which increased the cost of the Project. CDELBA
was responsible for the major portion (73%) of the cost increase. According
to ELETROBRAS, besides increases in the scope of the Project, other factors
contributing to the cost increase included: (1) the two and one-half year
increase in the implementation period; (2) an upgrading of the technical
sophistication of certain equipment which improved the reliability of the
system; and (3) an underestimation at appraisal of the costs of some
categories of equipment. This last factor did not lend itself to
verification, as the appraisal report did not include estimated unit cost
data which could be compared with actual unit cost data.
3.4.4     At appraisal, the Bank was expected to supply US$50.0 million of
financing with the balance, US$94.18 million, to be supplied by the
beneficiaries and ELETROBRAS. Through 1982, actual project financing
included US$49.78 million from Loan 1300-BR with the balance, US$143.03
million, furnished by the beneficiaries and ELETROBRAS.

3.5 Low-income Component
3.5.1     An important component of the Project was the pilot program to
extend service to low-income consumers (para. 2.2.2).  The actual number of
connections surpassed expectations: COELBA, 88,415 vs. 8,000; CELPE, 26,368
vs. 21,000; and COELCE, 69,153 vs. 21,000 (through December 1980). CDELBA
established a special unit which successfully carried out connections for
low-income customers. COELCE's achievement was basically due to a well
conceived campaign to educate potential customers concerning the advantages
of electricity as compared to other forms of energy.
3.6 Changes to the Closing Date, Allocation of Loan
Proceeds and Timing of Disbursements
3.6.1     As a result of changes and delays to the Project, the closing date
and allocation of loan proceeds differed considerably from what was expected
at appraisal. In response to the request of ELETROBRAS, the Bank agreed to
extend the closing date of the Loan Agreement three times. The original
cl-sing date was June 30, 1980. The revised closing dates were December 31,
1980, December 31, 1981 and June 30, 1982. Annexes 3.6 and 3.7 compare
actual and forecast data on allocation of loan proceeds and the timing of
disbursements. On June 30, 1983 at the request of ELETROBRAS, the Bank
cancelled the undisbursed balance of the Loan (US$223,858) which could not be
utilized for project-related expenditures. Cancellation was made effective
retroactively to the date of final disbursement, November 22, 1982.

IV. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
4.1 Actual and Forecast Data on Justification of the Project
4.1.1     Annex 4.1 compares actual and forecast annual sales levels of
COELBA, CELPE, and COELCE for the years 1976-1979; and sets forth actual
sales levels for 1980 and 1981. Annex 4.2 compares actual and forecast
growth rates of the residential, commercial and industrial markets of COELBA,
etc., for the period 1975 - 1979 and their respective percentages to total
sales. Annexes 4.3 to 4.5 set forth the return on the actual investment
programs of CDELBA, CELPE, and COELCE. The following paragraphs discuss
the information in these annexes.
4.2 Economic Justification of the Project
4.2.1     At appraisal, Bank staff and Brazilian power authorities expected
that the proposed Project would contribute to the economic growth of the
Northeastern region and the improvement of the standard of living of the
population, especially through the pilot program to provide service to
low-income customers. To reach these objectives and to provide for expected
load growths, the proposed Project was designed to be part of a least-cost
transmission/distribution investment program.
4.2.2     During the period 1975-1979 the actual level of COELBA summary
sales (12,289.9 GWh) surpassed the forecast level (11,964.6 GWh) by a small
margin (2.7%). The corresponding data for the other beneficiaries was as
follows: CELPE: 11,920.6 GWh, 12,326.4 GWh, and -4.0%; COELCE: 4,432.4 GWh,
4,031.7 GWh, and 9.9Z (Annex 4.1). Given that actual and forecast summary
sales levels were reasonably close, one may judge the sales forecasts to have
been satisfactory.
4.3 Return on Investment
4.3.1     The appraisal report cont!'ined the following estimates for the
returns on the investment programs of the individual beneficiaries: COELBA,
16.5%; CELPE, 18%; and COELCE, 16%. Based on actual investment cost data for
the period 1976 to 1981, actual revenue and operating cost data for the
period 1976 to 1984, and expected revenue and operating cost data for the
period 1985 to 2011, the returns en investment for the beneficiaries were;
COELBA, 8.4%; CELPE, 9.4%; and COELCE, 7.7%. The revenue data for the years
after 1985 reflects an expected gradual improvement in the real level of
sector tariffs such that the sector and the beneficiaries would be earning
10% annually after 1989. Since tariffs are used as a proxy for benefits, the
lower rates of return reflect the deterioration of real tariff levels that
took place during these years.

V.  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1 Actual and Forecast Financial Data, 1976-1979;
and Actual Financial Data, 1980-1981
5.1.1     Annexes 5.1 to 5.12 compare for the years 1976 to 1979  actual and
forecast financial data for COELBA, CELPE, and COELCE in the areas of: key
financial indicators, income statements, sources and applications of funds,
and balance sheets. The annexes also include actual data for 1980 and 1981.
Annex 3.3 sets forth the deflators used to convert actual data stated in
current prices into constant prices of June 1975. As no forecast financial
data for ELETROBRAS appeared in the staff appraisal report for the Northeast
Distribution Project, no actual financial data on ELETROBRAS appears in this
report. Actual financial data for the beneficiaries for years subsequent to
1981 is not included in the above annexes, as all but a small part of the
project had been completed by the end of 1981 (para. 3.2.1).
5.2 Government Tariff and Financing Policies for the Sector 1964-1982;
Revenue Covenants; and Tariff Agreements of the Early 1980's
5.2.1     Under the present sector organization (paras. 1.2.1 to 1.2.5), the
Government takes the most significant financial decisions, particularly with
respect to the setting of tariff levels, with little participation on the
part of the state governments and power utilities. In such a situation, the
financial performance of the beneficiaries of Loan 1300-BR paralleled that of
the sector, which in turn reflected tariff policies established by the
Government. Between 1976 and 1980, the legal return of the sector declined
from 11.4% to 4.9%, and then recovered to 7.9% in 1981. There was a
corresponding decline and recovery for COELBA, CELPE, and COELCE. As an
understanding of Government policy with respect to tariffs and financing for
the power sector is fundamental to an understanding of the financial
performance of the individual power utility, the following sets forth a brief
description of Government policy over the last twenty years. There is also a
discussion of the revenue covenants of the Project Agreements and the various
tariff agreements negotiated with the Bank since 1980.
5.2.2     In the early 1960's, by establishing ELETROBRAS, and later in the
early 1970's, by delineating the responsibilities of the Federal and state
operating companies, the Government created a new structure for sector
organization to make the power sector an important contributing factor to the
economic development of Brazil. To provide adequate levels of funding for
the ambitious sector investment program, the Government contributed high
levels of equity funding and set tariffs at realistic levels - that is, at
levels sufficient to earn the legal rate of remuneration (10-12%) on annually
revalued remunerable assets.
5.2.3     As a result of these tariff policies, the contribution or consumer
based funding to the growing investment program increased steadily throughout
the mid 1970's, at which time the sector reached a peak of financial
soundness. In 1973, the net (after debt service) consumer-based funding



- 15 -
provided 56Z of the sector's funding mix whereas borrowing had a share of
only 30%. Equity contributions composed the balance of the funding mix.
5.2.4     The oil crisis of the mid 1970's created a new set of financial
conditions for the power sector: (i) inflation affected substantially the
unit costs of the investment program of the seccor; and (ii) the Government's
fight against inflation resulted in a deterioration of real tariff levels and
of the consumer-based contribution to the investment program. As a
consequence of these conditions, the sector became increasingly dependent on
borrowings, resulting in a heavy debt service burden in the late 1970's and
early 1980's. Also, as a consequence of these conditions, many Brazilian
power companies were no longer able to meet the revenue requirements
covenanted with the Bank.
5.2.5     Section 4.04 of the Project Agreements and Section 3.02 (a) of the
Guarantee Agreement for Loan 1300-BR required, respectively: (i) COELBA,
CELPE, and COELCE to take all action necessary for tariffs to be set at
levels to produce revenues as provided by Braziliani law; and (ii) the
Government to take all reasonable action necessary to enable COELBA, etc., to
comply with obligations contained in the Project Agreements. Brazilian law
called for a return of 10-12% on remunerable assets,which level of
remuneration the sector failed to earn subsequent to 1978. The following
table compares for the period 1976-1981  the actual rates of re-muneration of
the sector and the beneficiaries:
Rates (X) of Remuneration , 1976-1981

*  Above returns include transfers to COELBA, etc., from Global Guarantee
Fund (GGF) if received.
5.2.6     In 1980, having experienced increasingly disappointing results in
obtaining compliance on the part of the power sector with existing revenue
covenants, the Bank reached an understanding whereby the Government would
increase tariff levels to achieve a rate of remuneration of 10% in 1981 and
future years and the recovery of revenue shortfalls of prior years over a
three-year period. The table above shows a substantial improvement in the
rate of remuneration of the sector in 1981, as compared with the previous
year, but a rate of remuneration which still fell short of the level agreed
in 1980. In 1981, sales growth fell short of projected levels because of
macroeconomic conditions, consideration of which further inhibited the
Government from raising power tariffs sufficiently to earn a return of 10%.
This unwillingness to raise tariff levels led to additional discussions with
the Bank and the formulation of a new revenue agreement. This agreement
represented an easing of revenue targets as originally covenanted.



- 16 -
5.2.7     In October 1981, the Bank and the Government agreed that the latter
would increase tariff levels by 3% in real terms in 1982 and 5% annually
thereafter, until the sector achieved a 10% rate of return and past
shortfalls were recovered. Having accepted this new approach, the Bank
formally agreed not to require compliance on the part of Brazilian power
borrowers with existing revenue covenants. In November 1983, this approach
was amended to reflect new financial conditions: both parties agreed on a
program of tariff action and other measures to increase the sector rate of
remuneration by one percentage point each year until 1989, when the sector
should earn a return of 10%. The various agreements referred to above did
not lead to an amendment of the revenue covenants of COELBA, etc., under Loan
1300-BR. Rather, the Bank committed itself not to seek enforcement of these
covenants as long as tariff levels were increased as agreed.
5.2.8     The successive revenue agreements after 1980 reflected the efforts
on the part of the Bank and Brazilian power authorities to establish tariff
levels under adverse and trying circumstances. With respect to the most
recently established revenue agreement (1983), the financial performance of
the sector in 1984 has been satisfactory; but the restoration of sector
finances will not be achieved in the near term.
5.2.9     The following paragraphs discuss the financial performances of
COELBA, CELPE, and COELCE for the period 1976-1979.
5.3 Sales, T,riff Levels and Finances, 1976-1979
5.3.1     The table below summarizes on an aggregate basis the financial Aata
of COELBA, CELPE, and COELCE for the period 1976-1979, the period of project
implementation originally expected at appraisal.

5.3.2     The above table shows that the actual level of aggregate sales,
average revenue per kWh sold, and operating revenues, while close to the
levels expected at appraisal for the group as a whole, did not grow as fast
as operating expenses, especially after 1977. Because the Government did not
increase tariff levels in line with increases for operating costs, the
beneficiaries as a group experienced declining rates of remunerable and
lower-than-expected levels of self financing.
5.3.3     By 1979 none of the beneficiaries were earning the rate of
remuneration provided by law (10-12%). The larger-than-expected level of
net interna!. cash generation of COELBA (Annex 5.3) was offset by the
lower-than-expected levels of net internal cash generation of CELPE
(Annex 5.7) and of COELCE (Annex 5.11), resulting in a self-financing
shortfall for the group as a whole amounting to Cr$128.5 million. To finance
this shortfall (Cr$128.5 million) and to finance increased funding
requirements (Cr$690.6 million) for construction expenditures and
expenditures for non-cash working capital, the beneficiaries resorted to
additional long-term borrowing (Cr$290.2 million) and additional net e'uity
contributions (Cr$528.9 million). The contributions helped to maintain the
debt equity ratio of the beneficiaries at acceptable levels -- between 15/85
(COELBA) and 32/68 (COELCr).
5.4   Financial Performance, 1980-1981
5.4.1     The deteriorating financial trend of 1978 and 1979 continued into
1980 and 1981. COELBA, CELPE, and COELCE earned returns on remunerable
assets of, respectively, 5.0%, 6.2%, and -5.6% in 1980. In 1981 COELBA,
CELPE, and COELCE earned returns or. remunerable assets of, respectively,
8.2%, 9.1%, and -4.0%. In addition to low rates of return, the beneficiaries
suffered rising levels of overdue accounts receivable. The unsatisfactory
financial performances in 1980 and 1981 did not result in delayed project
execution during those years. COELBA, CELPE, and COELCE received adequate
local funding from equity contributions and loans from ELETROBRAS.

VI.  INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1 The Borrower
6.1.1     During 1976-1981, ELETROBRAS supervised the following external
bodies, which hay made a significant contribution to improving the
functioning of the sector including the distribution function: (i) the
Committee for Distribution (CODI); (ii) the Coordinating Group for System
Planning (GCPS); and (iii) the Center for Electric Research (CEPEL). In
addition to establishing technical, operational, and commercial standards for
distribution companies, CODI provided ELETROBRAS with the capacity to
coordinate in improved fashion sector distribution planning. GCPS has
developed a set of mathematical planning models and programs specially suited
to the size and complexity of the power sector. GCPS has elaborated a
satisfactory methodology for annually updating generation and transmission
planning, taking into account the different needs of federal and state power
companies. CEPEL has carried out useful research on various metals (such as
aluminum for wiring residential structures) and corrosion.
6.2 The Beneficiaries
6.2.1     Annexes 6.1 to 6.3 compare, for the years 1976 to 1979, actual and
forecast technical indicators of performance. On balance, the Bank was
satisfied with the performance of the beneficiaries, which showed increasing
efficiency and administrative expertise as the implementation of the project
progressed. Bank staff were pleased that the beneficiaries, especially
COELBA and CELPE, were implementing management information systems which are
expected to be satisfactory. By not completing installatior of its
management information system, COELCE has not achieved the same leveL of
improvement as COELBA and CELPE.
6.3 The Bank
6.3.1     Bank participation in the sector encouraged the development of
co-ordinated sector operations and planning; and facilitated access to
foreign financing (commercial and bilateral) (para.1.1.5).
6.3.2     The Bank staff successfully 3ided implementation of the Project by
stimulating action to correct design flaws and by responding quickly to
requested changes (para. 3.1.9).
6.3.3     In the late 1970's and early 1980's, as part of its effort to
combat inflation and taking int) xccount economic and political
considerations, the Government did not adjust tariff levels in the amounts
required by the original revenue covenants. Faced with the fact of
non-compliance, the Bank was willing to take an understanding attitude toward
the changed conditions of the Brazilian economy, and accordingly negotiated
in 1981 and 1983 new sector revenue agreements. Subsequent financial
performance of the sector was in conformity with these agreements and
indicated that Brazilian power authorities took a serious attitude with



- 20 -
respect to their new obligations. Renegotiation and enforcement of new
tariff agreements was a reasonable approach; and indicated flexibility on the
part of Bank staff (para. 5.2.4).
6.4  The Government
6.4.1     By holding down tariffs, the Government has weakened the autonomy
of the sector which has also been affected by recession and sequences of
devaluation that occurred in recent years. Despite this development, the
Brazilian power sector continues to be well managed, with a better than
average performance in satisfying an extremely rapid market growth, and with
good investment planning.

VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1 A Successful Project
7.1.1     On balance, the Northeast Distribution Project should be judged
as successful in its results. The delays in initial project execution did
not constrain the subsequent abilities of the beneficiaries to service their
growing demand. ELETROBRAS and the beneficiaries strengthened and improved
their organizations. The financing shortfall due to low tariff levels did
not delay project implementation.
7.2 Monitoring Sector Policies
7.2.1     The sectoral developments during the execution of the Northeast
Distribution Project (para 6.4.1) illustrate the need to pay continuing
attention to basic policies, even in relatively well-managed national power
sectors, such as that of Brazil.
