APPRAISAL   OF   NORTHEAST POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
CENTRAIS EIEIRICAS BRLSILEIRAS S. A. (ELEIROEAS)
EZMI
SUMKARY AND OONCLUSIONS
i.       This report covers the appvaisal of an electric power distribution
expansion program in three states of Northeast Brazil for which Centrais
Eletricas Braaileiras S.A. (ELETR0BRAS), a government-owned corporation and
executing agency for the Brazilian electric program, has requested financial
assistance from the Bank. The borrower would be ELETR0RAS, which (except
for the amount needed for training and consulting services benefitting the
sector as a whole) would on-lend the proceeds of the proposed US$5O million
loan to Coapanhia de Eletricidade do Estado da Bahia (COELBL),       Coapanhia
de Eletricidade de Pernambuco (CELPE), and Companhia de Eletricidade do CearL
(CODLCE), hereinafter referred to as the beneficiaries. These companies are
joint-stock corporations whose principal owners are the states which they
serve: Ehia Pernambuco snd Cear respectively. The loan would be the first
the Bank would make to ELEQERAS.
iI.      The Brazilian power sector is well organized and managed.  The National
Department of Water and Electric Energy (DNAEE) performs the regulatory
functions and ELETROERAS discharges the planning, technical coordination,
financing, and administrative functions, both under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Nines and Energy. Power generation and high voltage transmission
is concentrated in a few specialized utilities and distribution is increasingly
the responsibility of state-iwned utilities such as the proposed boneficiariea.
A stable tariff system featuring service-at-cost, including a reasonable return
on annually revalued assets, has produced the massive consumer-based resource
mobilization required to support the sector's impressive growth in installed
capacity.
iii.     The beneficiaries' 4-year expansion programs consist of urgent
transmission and distribution works needed to keep pace with recent rapid
industrial growth and concomitant expansion of residential and commercial
power demand. The project oonsists of facilities to be initiated by
July 1, 1976, and completed by December 31, 1979,      for which financing
has not been secured from other sources. The project features a pilot
promotion program for extending aervice to low-income urban consumers, expected tt
benefit at least 41,000 households. Studies of regulations and standards for
system extensions which should contribute to improve planning and execution of rural
electrification programs throughout the country, and of possible areas of
improvement in     tariff structures which would be taken into account in
future Bank lending to the sector would also be carried out.
iv.      The projectls estimated cost is US$145 million, with a foreign ex-
change component of US$50 million witch would be covered by the proposed



- ii -
Bank loan. The remaining costs would be covered by funds contributed by the
beneficiaries? consumers (net internal cash generation and reinvestment of
power sales taxes).
v.        Ihe proceeds of the Bank loan would finsnce equilment and consulting
services and the foreign costs of training. Procurement of Bank-financed
equipment would be through international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Bank's guidelines, with Brazilian suppliers being granted a preference
over foreign suppliers equivalent to 15% of the latterts CIF price or the
applicable custom duty, whichever is lower. The beneficiaries vould be
assisted in the procurement process by consultants. No retroactive financing
or financing of interest during construction is proposed.
vi.       The project is technically sound.  Its estimated cost and under-
lying load growth are r=asonable. On the basis of estimated marginal costs
of energy to be distributed by the beneficiaries and current tariff levels,
the return on investments would be 16.5% for COELBA, 18 for CELPE and 16% for
COELCE. The average return for the three beneficiariest combined programs
would be 16.9%. The project's standard engineering would be performed by
the beneficiaries' technical staff. Design of special facilities would be
carried out with the assistance of consultants. Service extension works
would be contracted while rehabilitation works would be performed directly
by the beneficiaries.
vii.      The beneficiaries should be capable of implementing the project
with technical and managerial assistance from ELETROBRAS and consultants.
CELPE s and COELCE's financial management and control need strengthening;
the proposed loan would be instrumental in achieving improvement in these
areas with the support of ELETROBRhS.  The prospective financial perfomance
of the beneficiaries is good.  Daring the project construction years they
will cover 74% of their overall expansion program with resources contributed
by power sector consumers and achieve average financial rates of return of
9.8% (COELBA), 14.4% (CELPE) and 8.8% (COELCE).
viii.     Given the agreements reached with ELETRO3RAS, the beneficiaries and
the Federal and State Governments listed in Chapter 7 of this report, the
project forms a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$50 million, with a
term of 20 years including 3-1/2 yearst grace and guaranteed by the Federative
Republic of Brazil.



BRAZIL
UMLISAL OF N(RTHEST POWER DISTRIBTIl flWOJECT
CBliTRAIS ELICAS BRASItLIAS S.Ai (EISTROBA)
I . INTRODUCTIQI
1.01      Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (ELETROBAS)) a corporation whoa.
principal owner is the Goverment of Brazil and which serves as the Goverment's
agent in the power sector, has requested financial assistance for a distribution
expansion progra  in three states in Northeast Brazil: Bahia, Ceara and Forambuco.
1.02      The progrm consists of urgent tranmission and distribution works to
be carried out in the three states during the period 1976-1979, for which financing
has not been secured from other sources. The works would be carried out by the
electric power utilities serving the three states, which are corporations whose
main shareholders are the respective state goverments and EL3TR(nRAS. The boue-
ficiariesy Companhia de Eletricidade do Estado da Bahia (CCELBA), Companhia de
Eletricidade de Pernambuco (CELPE), and Companhia de Eletricidade do Ceara (OOELCE),
would receive technical and managerial support frm ELERDBRAS and consultants.
1.03      The transmisaion and distribution programs of the beneficiaries are
needed to support a continuation of the recent rapid growth of the industrial
sector in their service areas and the concomitant expansion of residontial and
cmmercial power demand. In the case of CMLCIE, a considerable effort is being
made to increase service coverage outside the city of Fortalesa, which is low even
by Northeast Brazilian standards. The project would include a pilot progran for
extending service to the low-income urban households which, though capable of
paying the minimum monthly bill, have not been able to afford the cost of connection
and interior wiring. At least 41i,000 households with an income well below the
median for the region's cities are expected to benefit from it.
1 .O4     The project would also include a study of criteria for system extensions
and of possible cost reductions in installations serving areas of low consumption
density, which should make an important contribution to the planning and execution
of rural electrification works in the whole country. The loan would also be
instrumental in the carrying out of tariff studies designed to identify possible
improvements in power tariff strustures.
1.05      The proposed loan of US$50 million would finance the project's foreign
cost. It would be the first by the Bank directly to ELETROBRAS (the Bank has made
mazW loans to ELETROtAS subsidiaries). ELETROBRAS would onlend the proceeds to
the three beneficiaries (except for the amount needed to pay for certain consulting
services and training). The participation of ELETRCBRAS is a key element of the
project. The three beneficiaries are generally weaker managerially and financially
than the Bank's previous borrowers in the Brazilian power sector. Without the
assistance of ELETROBRAS in project preparation and supervision it would have been
difficult to envisage Bank participation in their progras * It is anticipated
that this approach will be followed in other areas  of Brazil  in which the
weakness of the local utilities has precluded Bank aselstance in the dovelopment
of power distribution, an essential ingredient in the growth of medium- and aall-
scale industry.

1.06     This report is based on a feasibility stucly of the beneficiaries
1976-79 expansion programs prepared with the assistance of ZLETRORNAS and
on the findings of an appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. Jaime Acevedo-
Navas and Renato E. Salazar who visited Brazil in October 1975 and a mission
by Mr. Bernard Montfort to discuss power tariff structures with the Brazilian
authorities in March 1976. To shorten the presentation, findings are
organized by subject heading with subheadings for the three beneficiaries as
required.

2. THE POWER SECTOR
Energy Resources
2.01      The estimated total gross consumption of energy in Brazil in 1975
was 107,880 M.T.o.e. (0.99 T.o.e. per capita)3/ and it is expected to grow at
about 8% p.a. in the next 5 years, reaching about 1.26 T.o.e. per capita in
1980. Oil products account for about 50% of the national energy consumption,
wood products and wastes 27% and hydroelectricity 20% (see Annex 1).
2.02      Brazil's proven oil reserves are limited.  Present domestic production
of crude covers only 18% of the country's requirements and is concentrated in the
Northeast. To increase domestic production, the Government intends to accelerate
prospection. To this end the Government is seeking to attract the participation
of fortign firms in the exploration and possible exploitation of the oil reserves
in certain areas. *Btuminous and sub-bituminous coal reserves, which are locatea
in the South,are estimated at 3200 million tons. Coal extraction is rather
costly because shaft mining is predominantly required. Brazil is well endowed
with hydroelectric resources with a potential of about 100,000 MW of which less
than 15% has been utilized so far. Further economic utilization of these
resources would require installation of a proportion of non-hydro generating
capacity to firm up hydroelectric generation and to this end 3,000 MW of nuclear
generating capacity are expected to be in operation in the Southeast region by
1985. Gross consumption of electric energy in 1975 was 80,200 GWh (25$ of total
energy consumption) and has increased at a rate of 12.3k p.a. during the last 5
years, reaching a per capita gross consumption of 739 kWh.
2.03      The Northeast region, with 30% of Brazil's population, accounted for
about 25% of the total energy consumption of the country in 1975, with a per
capita consumption of about 0.8 T.o.e., more than half of which comes from wood
products and wastes.  Bagasse is used for production of process steam mainly in the
sugar industry. In 1970 the consumption of oil products accounted for 24h,natural gas
11% and hydroelectricity 7% of the total Northeast consumption (see Annex 1).
2.04      The country's main producing fields of oil and natural gas are located
in the Northeast region, the utilization of the latter being restricted to
this region. The region's principal hydroelectric resources is the Sao
Francisco river, with a potential of about 8000 MW of which 159b has been
utilized.  Electric energy consumption in the Northeast has grown at a rate
Of 17.7% p. a. in the last 5 years, reaching a consumption per capita of
266 kWh in 1975 and it is expected to reach about 400 kWh by 1980.

sector is ostablisbo*by Icree No. 68,024 of June 7, 1967, which defiea
the structure as consisting of the National Departuwnt of Water and Electric
Eergy (DN1), Z=OMAS and the various federal, state, municipal and
private concessionaires, al.1 under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Xines
and Energy (MHZ)  MM  performs regulatory functions including the graoting
of licenses for hydroeloctric sitea, assignrent of concession areasJ, setting
of tariffs and approving expansion plans. *LETROBRAS, which operates as an
executing agency under the jurisdiction of the 14E and in coordination with
DSAZE, performs the functions of (a) holding cmap&v. for those utilities wbere
the Governuent has acquired financial control, (b) financial institution
adcinistoring and allocating public funds among its subsidiaries and electric
utilities owned by stato govoriments and coordinating sector borrowings from
abroad, and (c) coordinating and assisting the development of the country's
electrification programs inoluding the rendering of technical, managerial and
training services (soe para. 3.02).
2.06      In accordance with Goverment policy, the power generation function
and related high voltage tramission is reserved largely to rour or               sub-
sidiaries which oover Brazil's five natural regions. They are Centrais ElBtricas
do Norte do Brasil (ELZTR0NCRTE) covering the North and part of the 1enter-Westj,
Companhia Hidro Elgtrica do Sao Francisco (CHESF) covering the Northeast, Furnas -
Centrais Kl6tricas (FURNAS) covering the Southeast and part of the Center-West,
and Contrais El6tricas do Sul do Brasil (ELETR(6UL) covering the South. Brazil
has standardized its generating system frequency at 60 cycles per second.
2.07     Also in accordance with Oovernment policy, the power distributi&M
functi.on at the state level is carried out mainly by utilitiea
controlled by the state goverments. In line with this policy, there have boen
in recent years a number of acquisitions and mergers of smaller municipally-and
privately-owned distribution companies by state-owned utilities as well as
transfers to them of soe of LETROB RAS' subsidiaries engaged in distribution.
Todsy, with the exception of the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo areas which are
served principally by Light-Servigos de lletricidade, S.A. (LIGHT), a privatoly-
owned enterprise, most of the power distribution is made through one company in
oach state.
2.08      Sector Planning and develolment is carried out4y EL=TROBRAS, which
has boen issuing aultiannal budgets for the sector (OP) which cover 5-year
periods and are revised and updated annually, since 1968. These budgets enable
EIETROBRAS and the Goveriment to select projects to meet anticipated demand and
to provide for them adequate financial support. Because the OP$E contain infor-
mation regarding equipment requirements, they also afford manufacturers of
electrical equipent opportunitios for better planning of their activities.
The Northeast Sub-sector
2.09      In 1975, about 97% of the electric power consumption of the Northeast
region was supplied by C5SF, the balance being supplied by industries which
generate their own power, usually in coordination with the use of process steam.
Industry and agriculture account for more than 57% of consumption, and the
second largest consumer category, residential, for just under 20%. CHESF sold
in 1975 about 80% of its power to the distributing companies of the Northeast
region, anong which are the proposed beneficiaries, the remainder being sold
I/ Orgamento 1lurianual do Setor de Energia E16trica.



directly to large industries connected at 230 kV. The proportion of energy to
be sold through distribution companies including the three beneficiaries, is
likely to decrease due to the increasing proportion of energy for irrigation
(see para. 2.11) which would be distributed through government agricultural
agencies.
2.10         CHESF has a generating capacity in operation of 1853 MW (see Annex 2),
91; of which is hydro and 9% steam or gas turbines. 92A of the hydro capacity
corresponds to the Paulo Afonso stations of the Sao Francisco river. CHESF has
3910 MW generating capacity under construction which would cover the demand up to
1980. The main item of generating capacity under construction is the Paulo Afonso
IV Project, with 2000 MW installed capacity for which the Bank has provided
financial assistance under Loan 1008-BR. CHESF's transmission system serving the
beneficiaries' systems is shown in map IBRD 119L0.
2.11         CHESF has been able to supply power to the distribution companies of
the Northeast permitting them to serve the ultimate consumers at levels consistent
with increasing demana and is expected to do so in the future. Its expansion pro-
gram is based on the market study made by ELETROBRAS for the Northeast for the
period 1975-1985. According to this study, the expected composition of the load for
the period is as follows:

As can be seen in the table the proportion of the residential, commercial and
Government consumption is expected to decrease and the industrial and irrigation
loads to increase; the latter two are a result of the programs which the Govern-
ment has undertaken for the development of the Northeast.
Electric Power Tariffs
2.12         Since 196L Brazilian electric power tariffs have been based on a service-
at-cost system, whereby rates have been set at the levels required to pruduce suf-
ficient revenues to cover operating expenses (excluding financial charges), de-
preciation, reversion ?I and a reasonable return on investment. Since 1966 the
annual revaluation of assets has been mandatory, and since 1971 a statutory rate of
return 2/ of not less than 10C and not more than 12* at DNAEE's discretion has been
in effect. This system, which is consistent with sound financial and public utility
practices, has been the cornerstone to the development of the sector, which since
its inception increased installed capacity at an average annual rate of 10.1h
reaching about 20,100 MW in 1975, to keep pace with an average annual growth in
gross consumption of 9.2> and improve reserve margins.
3. Average annual rate of growth for the previous 5 years.
/ A special electric power sector tax. Refer to Annex 5 for details.
/ Because of the inclusion of reversion in its calculation and the use of year-end,
rather than average values, this statutory return is not comparable to the
rates of return on average net fixed assets in operation commonly used in appraisal
of public utilities (see Annex 13).



- 6 -
2.13         DNAEE has in recent years used its discretionary powers to achieve
progressive equalization of customer rates throughout Brazil, a government
policy enacted into law in 1974. While the social objectives of this policy are
appreciated, the possibility of economic demerit arising from it should be in-
vestigated further (para. 2.17). Because the rate equalization was effected by
granting lower tariff increases to the comparatively higher cost utilities, it
resulted in some erosion of tariffs in real terms and adversely affected their
rates of return.  This was the case with the proposed beneficiaries (para. 6.02).
Although the shortfalls were carried forward in the utilities' accounts to be
offset over time against future surplus returns, this practice resulted in some
liquidity problems for the power sector.
2.14         The Government took  action in 1975 to resolve these problems, by
raising tariffs and establishing the Global Guarantee Fund jV, a cross-subsidization
mechanism intended to assure qualifying utilities a statutory return of up to 10A.
This mechanism is funded by an increase of up to 2% in reversion charges and the
proceeds used to supplement the tariff revenues of qualifying utilities. Along
with this redistributive mechanism, whereby greater sums are collected from
the regions where the comparatively more financially efficient utilities operate
to be reallocated to the less developed regions where the comparatively higher
cost utilities operate, DNAEE put into effect a number of measures to control
the latter utilities' operating efficiency with a view to increasing their
productivity. In substanoe, these measures restrict the utilities benefitting
from this mechanism from increasing their operating costs, undertaking invest-
ments and expanding their markets without DNAEE's prior approval. In addition,
to qualify for the benefits of this mechanism, a utility must submit to DNAEE
evidence that it has (a) signed an agreement with its respective State providing
for the settlement of any overdue accounts, and (b) entered into an agreement
with the majority Government shareholder providing for the reinvestment in
share capital of all its future dividends. As explained in para. 6.11, transfers
from the Global Guarantee Fund are an important element of the financing plan
of the project and the beneficiaries agreed that, in the event it would be
necessary for them to receive transfers from the Fund,they would maintain their
eligibility for such transfers.
2.15         As under nrevious loans to Brazilian electric power companies,
the beneficiaries agreed to maintain their earnings (inclusive of transfers
from the Global Guarantee Fund) at levels consistent with sound financial
and nublic utility practices and in accordance with existing legislation.
The Federal Government agreed that DNAEE will take a timely action on the
beneficiaries' applications for tariff and adjustment or transfers. Finally,
the Federal Government has agreed to confirm  the Bank's understanding that
DNAEE will exercise its discretionary powers to allow the beneficiaries a
statutory return of at least 10. Any change in legislation which would
materially and adversely affect the beneficiaries' financial position, would
be an additional event of default.

-7-
Tariff Structures
2.16     The schedules applied to consumers of the three beneficiaries are
shown in Table 1 of Annex 5. To appreciate the relative prices of energy
charged to the consmers, the average unit price for some typical conswmer
levels of the main categories have been calculated and shown in 1Uble 2 of
Annex 5. Tariffs charged to large industrial consumers consist of a sizeable
(approximately 58% of the revenue from medium and high-voltage supply)
capacity charge and a relatively low energy charge, reflecting the cost
structure of Brazil's predominantly hydroelectric generating capacity.
Tariffs charged to medium and large-scale urban residential and commercial
consumers    are among the highest in the world (after considering the sole
tax which these customers must pay) and should discourage any nonessential
consumption. 9anll urban consumers and rural consumers are given a discount.
2.17     The present tariff schedule is basically rational and simple, and
it should result in a high level of resource mobilization while discouraging
nonessential use of electricity.  There are, though, some important aspects
that should be investigated and Bank staff has been assisting DNAEE   and
ELETROERMAS in preparing a study of electricity tariffs throughout Brazil.
The study should allow the Government to assess the desirability of modifying
the tariffs to ensure that their level and structure achieve an appropriate
balance in pursuing the various sector objectives, namely financial, social
and economical. Some of the specific topics that will be considered are
as follows:
a) whether present consumer classifications and relative price
levels among consumer categories and among regions are
the most appropriate on social and economic grounds;
b) the economic advantage of charging different prices for the
sake load categories for some types of consumer (large or
power intensive industries, etc) according to the location
of load, in line with the long-term marginal cost of service;
c) the economic effect on the whole power system (generation,
transmission and distribution) and thb feasibility of
establishing "off peak" and seasonal tariffs, particularly in the
Northeast.
An aspect relevant to the extended transmission system of CHESF is the
inadequacy of the conventional penalty charge for reactive energy which could
be substituted by a penalty based on "on peak" reactive power.
2.18     The Government has confirmed that the tariff study will be carried
out by DNAEE with the participation of ELETROBRAS and the assistance of
consultants as necessary.  It undertook to present to the Bank, when available,



terms of reference for the study satisfactory to the Bank and the study's
resulta. The Government also confirmed that the topics listed in the
previous paragraph will be included in the study. The proposed loan would
provide funds for financing the consulting services for the tariff study
and for overseas training of DNAEE's staff (see Annex 14).



3. THE BORROWER AND THE BENEFICIARIES
The Borrower
3.01         The borrower would be ELETROBRAS. Its role in the project consists
of coordinating its preparation locally, participating in the various studies
carried out during its execution, formulating some improvement plans, pro-
viding some managerial assistance and serving as a channel for on-lending
the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan to the beneficiaries, all of which are
consonant with ELETROBRASt statutory functions.
3.02         Established in 19611/ as an open capital corporation and owned almost
entirely by the Federal Government, ELETROBRAS has successfully discharged its
role of planning, financing and coordinating the Brazilian electric power
program. It acts as a sectoral planning unit, holding company and development
bank.  Its resources consist of net cash generation (dividends, interest, loan
amortization payments and miscellaneous other income less debt service and net
dividend payments) which in the period 1970-75 together averaged 38% of total
resources; sole tax, 10%; reversion reserve, 19%; compulsory loan, 23%; federal
budgetary appropriations, 4%; and borrowings, 6%. Outstanding borrowings at
year-end 1975 totalled Cr$15.3 billion (about US$1.7 billion equivalent), of
which 49% in the form of debentures arising from the compulsory loan, 28%
representing reversion accruals to the Federal Government and 23; in loans. Of
these loans, (totalling Cr$3.5 billion-about US$O.4 billion equivalent) 64% came
from sources abroad (IDB, bilateral agencies, commercial banks and utility
holding companies) and 36% from domestic sources. Annex 6 contains ELETROBRAS'
summarized financial statements for the period 1970-1975. Its large and growing
sources of funds V constitute a broad base for expanding its borrowings, and
ELETROBRAS is expected to become increasingly active in foreign financial markets.
The Beneficiaries
3.03         The beneficiaries would be COELBA, CELPE and COELCE which are stock
corporations, the main shareholders being ELETROBRAS and the states of BEhia,
Pernambuco and Ceara respectively, as shown in Table 2 of Annex 2. Theae
corporations have the concession for planning, building and operating transmission
and distribution systems in their respective states where they are practically
the sole concessionaires, with the exception of CHESF, which supplies power to
major industries connected at 230 kV, and some small municipalities which retail
the power delivered to them by the beneficiaries. Table 2 of Annex 2 summarizes
the main statistical information on the beneficiaries for 1975.
3.Ol         The beneficiaries have been created by consolidating several
small utilities in their respective states, most of which generated their own
power in small plants (mainly diesel). These plants have now largely been
replaced by power delivered from CHESF's Northeast interconnected system. The
major exceptions are in the state of Bahia where OOELBA still operates isolated
generating facilities in areas that are now in process of being integrated with
the interconnected system. Part of the project consists of transmission lines
to integrate such isolated areas.
1 Decreee Law No. 3890-A of April 25, 1961
d See Annex 5



- 10 -
3.05         COELBA was founded in 1960 and gradually incorporated other companies
of several areas of the state of Bahiasuch as Centrais Eletricas do Rio das CDntas
in 1968 and Companhia Energia Eletrica da Bahia (a subsidiary of EIETROBRAS whichI
had the concession of the city of Salvador and surroundings) in 1972.
CELPE was created in 1968 after the state of Pernambuco took over
the Pernambuco Tramways and Power Company, Ltd. and later absorbed other small
utilities operating in the state.
COELCE was created in 197i as a result of consolidation of four
utilities of the state: Companhia Noreste de Eletrificagao de Fortaleza,
Companhia de Eletrificagao Centro Norte do Ceara, Companhia de Eletricidade do
Cariri, and Companhia de Eletrificacao Rural do Noreste.
3.06         The quality of service provided by the 3 companies is adequate and
the level of distribution losses seems acceptable. Service coverage is discuased
in para. 3.12. The beneficiaries are gradually modernizing their distribution
systems in areas where old installations still remain. Engineering designs of
new works are in accordance with up-to-date standards. Designs adopted at
present for rural or semi-urban sectors, where small loads are distributed in
large areas result in relatively high capital investment per kWh sold which
make this type of works uneconomical (para. 3.14).
Organization and Management
3.07         The beneficiaries are each administered by a bard of Directors and
a Consultative Council whose members are elected by the Shareholder's Assembly
(Annex 12 shows their respective organization charts). Each beneficiary has a
president, who is also a member of the Board. In the longer-established bene-
ficiaries (CELPE and COELBA) lines of responsibility are clearly defined, with
the president being the chief executive officer whereas in the more recently
established one (COELCE) management of the day-to-day business is divided
between various board members (one of whom is the President of the company)
each of whom heads a group of departments.  CELPE's and OOELBA's presidents
are each assisted by a vice-president, who are primarily in charge of planning
and who are also members of the respective Boards. The Consultative Coun¢ilts
prime function which emanates from the Law of Corporations is to advise the
Boards and to participate in the Shareholder's Assembly.
3.08         Management of the beneficiaries' operations seems adequate, although
as in most distribution companies in developing countries, the main emphasis
is given to day-to-day operations i.e., "to maintain service", while the technical
planning is given low priority, and excepting COELBA, financial management
and control is practically nonexistent. COELBA's middle management has
wider experience in power distribution although they tend to be somewhat
conservative in their attitude towards system expansions. CELPE's seems to
be the most dynamic and receptive to new methods among the three. COELCEI5
organization needs streamlining, including the clarification of lines of
authority under a single chief executive. ELETROERAS is aware of this problem
and is giving considerable managerial support to COELGE with a view to
strenghening its organization. To improve financial management and planning
in CELPE and COELCE, ELETROBRAS and the two companies have agreed to prepare
and submit to the Bank within twelve months from loan signature an improvement
program for the financial functions of the two companies. ELETROBRAS, CELPE
and COELCE agreed during negotiations to carry out this program by December 31,



- 11 -
1978. It is expected that the experience gained in preparation and execution
of the Bank project and with the monitoring during loan supervision (para. 5.10)
will promote a better balance between day-to-day concerns and planning and
control in all three companies.
3.09        The beneficiaries have had little or no experience in procurement
under international competitive bidding. To assist them in this regard they
would al employ the services of Companhia Auxiliar de lnpresas Eletricas
Brasileiras (CAEEB) a Brazilian consulting campany, which is also assisting
Companhia Paranaense de Energia ELetrica (COPEL) in connection with its
distribution project.
Personnel and Training
3.10        The number of employees of the beneficiaries in 1975, classified
in three levels of training background and the percentage engaged in  con-
struction works are shown in the table below:
COELBA      CELPE        COELCE
University                      156   4.7   128  3.4   120  4.1
Vocational                     1309  39.8  1269  33.7  1155  39.6
Skilled and semi-skilled labor 1816  55.5  2363 62.9  1639
Total                        3281 100.0   3 100.0  2914 100.0
% engaged in construction works      15.0         1L.8         14.i
3.11        The composition by training background is similar for the three
companies and shows, as in most power distribution companies in Latin America,
a high proportion in the skilled and semi-skilled labor category. The bene-
ficiaries are aware of the fact that a higher proportion in the other
categories is desirable for improving productivity. Training for higher
level staff takes place mainly in universities. ELETROBRAS has agreed to
propose a training program satisfactory to the Bank for the beneficiaries'
technical staff within twelve months from loan signature. The foreign
cost of the training for specialized personnel and of experts hired for
this training program would be financed by the proposed loan (see Annex 1l).
For the intermediate and lower levels the beneficiaries have ample and
modern training facilities which seem to be effectively utilized. The
targets for improvement in the proportion of high and medium level staff
are included among the project performance indicators (para. 5.10).
Distribution System EKtensions and Rural Electrification
3.12        As indicated in Annex 2 electric service coverage in the beneficiaries'
concession areas is low, ranging from about 63% in highly populated areas to
about 3% in the rural areas of COELCEts concession. Coverage is particularly
poor in COELCE's system outside the city of Fortaleza. Only 14A of the popula-
tion of other urbanized areas in the state of Ceara have service (as compared to



- 12 -
40-50% in the corresponding areas of the other two states. Statistics on
rural consumption in the areas served by the beneficiaries are unreliable. A
rough estimate indicates that the proportion of rural consumption in the
total, which was below 1IN in 1970 would increase to at least 156 by mid-
1979. The main obstacle to increasing coverage in sparsely populated areas
is the poor investaent return due to high capital and operating cost per
kWh sold. Ehergy consumption is low in these areas because of the low
average income of the population.
3.13     As explained in Annex 3, the beneficiaries have different criteria
to select which system extensions should be executed among those requested by
interested groups. A general regulation on selection of system extensios
appears necessary and the Government agreed to carry out a study on this
matter, under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, to be presented
to the Bank not later than 6 months after the signature of the proposed
loan. The results of the study would be presented to the Bank within eighteen
months of loan signature. It is expeoted that DNAEE wil1 carry out the
study with the assistance of ELETRORAS.
3.i4     One possibility for increasing service coverage in areas of low
consumption density is to reduce investment cost by adopting lower cost
standards (compatible with safety requirements) for distribution facilities
in these areas, even at expense of some reduction in service reliability.
ELETROBRAS and the Bank agreed that this aspect will be studied by ELETROERAS,
under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank, with the assistance, as
needed, of consultants experienced in power supply in low-density areas.
The findings of the study, which is expected to be completed within eighteen
months from loan signature, would be discussed with the Bank.
Service to Low-Income Households
3.15     One important feature of the proposed loan is a pilot program to
extend service to low-income consumers. The beneficiaries agreed to promote
the connection of households that are in the position to pay the minimum elec-
tric bill (30 kWh per month) at present but cannot afford the payment of
connection fee and the instaIlation of their household wiring.
3.16     The beneficiaries will offer to householders living in areas with
low-tension distribution lines at their doors but which are not connected:
a) exemption from the usual connection fee;
b) financing of the installation within the household of minimum
wiring facilities, which will be repaid in monthly installments
to be added to the electric bill.
3.17     The precise impact of this part of the project on the low-income popu-
lation of the concession areas is unknown at this time, as there are no reliable
data on the low-income population without electric service and no way to predict



- 13 -
possible response to the proposed plan. The beneficiaries' estimate of
the minimum response to this plan is: 21,000 connections for CELEI,
8,000 for COEIBA and 12,000 for COELCE. These estimates are very conservative,
especially that of COELBA. The information to be obtained in the execution
of the pilot program could be applied for formulation of future programs,
either in the beneficiaries'service areas or in those of other utilities
of the Northeast region. To stimulate efforts in this direction, somewhat
higher targets are included in the proposed performance indicators (para. 5.10).
3.18     The cost of household wiring and the total value of monthly electric
bills for potential low-income consumers as estimated by the beneficiaries
are shown in Annex 3. Based on the latter, the minimum monthly income of
the households that could participate in the plan has been estimated at
US$75-98 which corresponds to an annual income of approximately US$172-227
per capita. The estimated median income of urban households in the Northeast
is US$227 per month, well above the minimum required for participation.
Audit
3.19     The accounts of ELETROBRAS and the beneficiaries have been audited
by Messrs. Boucinhas, Campos, Coopers & Lybrand, Ltd., an acceptable firm
of independent auditors. The scope of the auditor's work appears satisfactory.
ELETROBRAS and the beneficiaries agreed during negotiations to continue appoint-
ing independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and to send to the Bank their
audited financial statements together with their auditors' reports within five
months of the end of their fiscal year, each year for the duration of the loan.

4. THE PROJECT
Expansion Program
4.01     The beneficiaries' 1976-79 expansion program can be summarized as
follows:
COELBA      CELPE     COELCE

13.8/low tension       232          205       127
Proportionally to its present demand, COELCE has the largest expansion program
of subtransmission and distribution systems due mainly to a special effort,
financed by the State Government, to provide service in the extensive areas
of the state of Ceara, which do not at present have access to public service
supply. The program covers both the works to be financed under the Bank loan
(the project) and other works for which specific financing from state agencies
is available (the complementary works) 1/.
4.02     The estimated cost of the program including escalation and excluding
,4nterest during construction is US$216.07 million equivalent as follows:
COELBA      CELPE     COELCE    TOTAL
-UST  million)
IBRD project               67.08        50.92     27.34    145.34

Total                    92.82       75.32      47.93    216.07
Because this program consists of many small, scattered works, it does not lend
itself to supplier financing. However, there is a possibility that co-financing
may be arranged (see para. 6.09).
The Project
4.03     The project includes a portion of the above program to be carried out
between June 30, 1976 and December 31, 1979 (the project period), and the studies
and training for which EIETROBRAS would be directly responsible. The main
components are as follows (see Annex 4):

the isolated system in the Northwestern area of the state
of Bahia around the village of Bom Jesus da Lapa to CHESF's
Northeast interconnected system. The other 70 km would re-
inforce the transmission system between Itabuna and Ponto
Asterio in the Southern part of the state. 16 km of 69 kV
single circuit underground cable between Matatu and Graca
substations in the city of Salvador.  117 km of lines of 34.5

Cost Estimates
4.04       The total and foreign costset the Bank project are estimated at
US$145.3 million and US$50.5 million equivalent, respectively. The proposed
US$50 million Bank loan would finance the for ign cost of the project. The
cost estimates for the Bank project,which are shown in the table below, were
prepared by the benefioiaries in collaboration with consultants, reflect
prices of June 1975, and include physical contingencies of 5% of direct
cost which is reasonable for this type of project. While mid-1975 prices
have not been adjusted to a more recent base in order to maintain consistency
with the beneficiarios financial projections, adequate price contingencies
have been added to cover actual and expected foreign sad local price increases
as follows: 7% in the second half of 1975, 9% in 1976 and 8% thereafter. These
contingencies are ewpressed in terms of US dollars and converted into Cr$ at
the rate prevailing in June 1975 (see para. 6.05).

Engineering and Project Execution
h.05      Standard engineering phases of the project would be carried out by the
beneficiaries' engineering staff. Design of special parts of the project, such as
underground distribution facilities, would be carried out with the assistance
of consultants. The beneficiaries employ contractors for the construction of
new transmission and distribution lines and substations and use their own forces
for the rehabilitation of works in operation. CAEEB will assist the beneficiaries
in the procurement process, i.e., preparing bidding documents, publication and
evaluation of bids and inspection, and in coordinating the equipment requirements
of the three beneficiaries, by consolidating orders aiming at cost reductions and
simplification of procedures. Consulting services to be financed by the proposed
loan have been estimated at 76 man-months (Annex 14)Y. The base costs (excluding
travel and subsistence) average uS$4,550 per man-month.
4.o6      The procurement process for the equipment required by the project started
in February 1976 with the advertising and issuance of specifications; orders are
expected to be placed by November-December 1976, which would permit starting
construction in early 1977. ELETROBRAS would be responsible for the consulting and
training component of the loan, which as explained in Annex 14, contains some
elements which are of interest to the power sector as a whole. The project is
expected to be completed in December 1979. Annex 7 shows the proposed project
implementation schedule, which will be used to monitor progress during project
execution.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.07      Procurement of the equipment to be financed by the Bank will be through
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
Manufacturers of equipment financed by the proposed loan, whose bids contain
components manufactured in Brazil equal to at least 50% of the value of the bid
would be given a margin of preference of 15%, or the applicable import duties,
whichever is lower. Brazilian suppliers of the items included in the project are
reasonably competitive. Foreign cost estimates assume thats (i) US$49.2 million



- 18 -
equivalent of equipment and materials will be acquired through ICB in accordance
witl Bank guidelines, under the proposed Bank loan; and ii) Brazilian suppliers
would be awarded up to two-thirds of the value of the contracts placed through
such bidding.
4.08       The equipment component of the program which would not be financed
under the proposed loan, will be procured locally under the beneficiaries'
non.&I procedures which are satisfactory. The beneficiaries' consultant
(CMEED) maintains a roster of qualified suppliers and invites an appropriate
number to submit quotations. Brazilian legislation precludes ICB for items
not financed by long-term foreign loans that can be produced locally. However,
an noted above, such locally produced items are reasonably competitive in
price with international products and project cost should not increase
significantly over the estimate as a result of these restrictions.
4.09       As stated above, TTS$49.2 million equivalent of equipment needed
for the project has been selected for Bank financing under ICB. The Bank
loan would also include US$0.8 million equivalent for consulting
services  and  training.-Disbursements  fr6mi  the Bank loan would
be made  against  appropriate  documentation---for 1006 of  the
foreign exchange cost of imported goods or 100A of the ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured goods, and for the total cost of specific consultant
services and 100% of foreign exchange cost of trainingt  No  disburse-
ments will be made in respect of expenditures made prior to the signing of
the Loan Agreement. Because of the ongoing nature of investments in dis-
tribution, any loan funds remaining undisbursed upon completion of the project
could be applied, after agreement with the Bank, to other works of similar
nature included in the beneficiaries' program. Estimated loan disbursements
are shown in Annex 11.
4.10       Out of the US$M9.2 million equivalent assdgned for the equipment
component, US$46 million (93%) would be alloted directly among the three
beneficiaries in proportion to the equipment and materials requirements for
their individual participation in the project, as follows:
US$ million
OOELBA                                 22.0
CELPE                                  15.5
OOELCE                                  8.5
TOTAL                       'V.0
The balance (US$3 .2 million or 7%) would be available to finance additional
equipment and materials required for the completion of the beneficiaries'
projects on a "first come-first served" basis. This procedure would permit
the setting of the ultimate amounts of the sub-loans on the basis of the
utilities' demonstrated performance in carrying out their projects. It is
also intended to facilitate the early full utilization of the loan by the



- 19 -
beneficiaries. The portion of the Bank loan used for training and consulting
services to the beneficiaries (paras. 3.08, 3.11 and 4.05) would be alloted
to them by EIETROEAS in proportion to their use of these services.
Environmental Aspects
4.11     It is not expected that the project will have adverse effects on
the environment.

5. JUSTIFMATIOE (O THE   OCT
ProJect ObJective.
5.01      A reliable SUPPly of electric power is easextial to the xortheast '
economic growth and the improvemnt of the standard of living of its population.
The proJect is the major elment of a progrm being undertaken by the
beneficiaries to provide the eseatial infrastructure nded to support
a cootinuation of the recent rapid growth of the industrial sector and the
concomitant expansion of commercial and residential power dmand. In the case
of the state of Bahia, the expasion of the interconnected system through
the 138 kV lines contemplated in C(ZLBA'I segment of the project would
contribute to substitution of oil generated energy by hydroelectric enrgy
supplied fro CMEMS'. sstem.
5.02      In addition to supporting infrastructure for productive activities,
the project will assist CLCEN's efforts in improving service outside the
city of Fortalesa and would include a pilot progrm btr a  three companies for
providing electric service to a portion of low-ineome sector of the population
which cannot pay the connection fee and the household wrinAg. The Bank's
participation would stimulate revision of rural distribution designs to reduce
costs, rationalising regulations for system extensaoms and revising the tariff
structure for better utilization of the facilities of the electric power sector.
Load Forecast
5.03      The projeotion of the growth in demand in the area  served by the
three bonficiaries ws based on a major power market studr for the Northest
region prpared in 1971 by a coordinating committee headed by  ITICUAS with
participation of the distribution companins, Superintandezcia de D1senvolvimento
do Nordeste (SUDIE) and other rgionAl agencies and oonaultants, which was
updated by the beneficiaries in 1974 and 75. The stud  analvses the demographic,
social and economic develop ent expected in each of 75 districts over the period
1970-1985. The load projections are baseds maoog other factors on an expected
average GNP growth for the region in 1975-79 of 10% p.a. which in not expected to
be affected by the slow down in GNP growth being experienced in the Southeast
and South regions. Tho results of this market study (with aome adjustments made
during the appraisal mission) are reasonable. Actual and forecast sales are
shown in table 1 of Annex 8.
5.014     The composition and evolution of the enrgy sold per consumer
category for the period 1970-74 and forecasted for 1975-79 is shown in table 2
of Annex 8. The proportion of residential, commercial and industrial consumption
in the total sales of COMM* and CELPE was quite siailar in 1970 add it is
expected to be the same in 1979. Industrial consumption accounts for the largest
shar  of sales (54% and 49% for CMTLBA and GULPS respectively) and residential
saloe are about 21% of the total. These two util1ties expect industrial sales
to increase more rapidly than other categories over the poriod 1975-79. This
is due mainly to the increase of industrial activity in the states of Bahia
and NFrnambuco and the transfer by CHLSF to the distribution companies of large
conouers connected at 69 kV. Industrialisation is less advanced in the state
of Ceara, and only 35% of CGULCE's sales are to inhustrial conoumers. Residential
consumers account for 29% of COXLCts sales. Tbese proportions are not expected
to change significantly over the period 1975-79.



- 21 -
Iast-Cost Solution
5.05      The project is the aajor segoent of the beneficiaries' '19'76-79
distribution investment program, which is required to take care of the load
increase during this period. The program is based on the selection of the
least-cost solution in all cases where alternatives exist.
5.06     As explained in Annex 9, the proposed program is adequate to neet
the load lcrease during the construction period.
5.07     Another aspect to consider in judging the adequacy of the program
are the investment costs per incremental [VA demand during the project
period (soo Annex 9) which in U$S/VA are: 369, 256 and 454 for COKKL&,
CILM and C4ELCZ, respectively, and are reasonable. CNLB&A's higher unit
cost over CKLPI*$a is due to the substantial proportion of underground ins-
tallations required in the distribution system of Salvador. The compleentary
works in CELC's program include more than 5,000 kas of 13.8 kV distribution
lines to integrate its rural systm and to open now areas, with low load
density (para. 4.01), which account for the higher unit cost of its program.
Return on Investmet
5.08      In view of the complexity of the system's effects, and of the
difficulty in interpretation, an internal rate of return on the ProJect has
not been calculated. However, a rate of return on the overall investment
progrm has been estimated. This return has been evaluated as shown in Annex
99 by equalising the present worth of the zevenues derived frm incremeatal
output and the present worth of coats, defined to include not only those costs
directly related to the distribution project itself, but also incremntal
generation and trauseission costs. Under these asumptions, the rate of
return mounts to 16.5% for COKLBA, 18% for aILFE and 16% for CGOLC=9 which
suggest that on average the price that consumers will be requested to pay
for powr will be considerably in exosso of incremental system costs. A
sensitivity analysis was also carried out to determine the effect of a 10%
increase in project investment and operating cost and a 10% of reduction in
benefits. With a 10% increase in instment and operating costs, the rates of
return would respectively be: 15.4%, 16.7% and 15%, for C(ELB&, CAM and
CCaC. With a 10% decrease in benefits the value would be: 14.3%, 15% and
14.5%. The averag return for the combined programs of the three beneficiaries
would be 16.J%. The senitivity analysis yields returns of 15.7% and 14.7%
for the cobied rogram, if cots are assumed to rise by 10% ad bnofits
to declin  by 10s, respectively.



- 22 -
5.09       The above rate of return calculation uses revenues as a proxy
for the benefits derived from the program. Electric power prices are
regulated rather than being set by market forces and actual prices paid
by  consumers do not neessarily reflect the benefit. obtained in us.
of electricity. Prices paid by low income and rural consumers, in
particular, are low and probably do not reflect the full benefit that
these consumers derive from electric lighting, appliances and use of
simple machine tools.
Performance Indicators
5.10       The project is expected to lead to improved erficiency through
proper planning of the beneficiaries activities, maintenance or reduction
of present levels of distribution losses, improvement of labor productivity
and of asset management. The project would also be a vehicle for extending
electric service to areas without electricity and for the connection of
low-income consumers.  Indicators of expected progress towards these
objectives during the project period are shown in Annex 10. ELETROHEAS
and the beneficiaries confirmed them during negotiations and will report
on progress during project execution.

6. FUIWCS
u=sz
6.01      The capital structurs of the proposed beneficiaries have been and
will roeain unsually strong.  however, their finacial perfozraneo has not
been entirely satisfactory reflecting their far-flung operations, the multi-
plicity of low-density markets they serve and the financially uiattractive
services they have sometimes been induced to render. The levels of their
operating costs, customer receivables and materials inventories need watching.
Their financial outlooks would be unsatisfactory were it not for the cross-
subsidization mechanisa put into effect in 1975, which would assure them the 10%
return on resunerable investment on which their financing plans are based.
To quality for this mechanism, the beneficiaries will have to accept a much
ti*tIr financial disciplino than in the past. Daring the Bank project construc-
tion years they would financo 74% of their overall capital investmext program
with funds contributed directly by power conaumers. Their actual and estimated
financial statments together with details on their present and future finances
are contained in Annex 13, which comploeenta the summary analysis presented
below.
Financial Performanoe
6.02      The beneficiaries' statutory rate of return has generally been lower
than the 10% to 12% attained by other Brazilian power utilities financed by the
Bank. This stems from the nature of the areas they serve which require higher
investment costs per custoer and per kWh sold. Their 1973-74 rates of return
were as follows:
Statuto  V1         Financial&'
CEL1S              10.9    8.0         16.4   13.0
CaELBA              9.0    7.8         10.5  10.4
CCELCB              8.1    5.3         no.a    8.7
The appreciable drop in 1974 was due largely to substantial mandatory salary
readjustments.
6.03      While as noted in paragraph 2.14, DNUA  has initiated a program to
Improve the operating officiency of the higher cost utilities such as the
boenficiaries, the latter should pay special attention to controlling their
operating cost levels. The beneficiaries should also improve the management
of their accounts receivable and inventories. In order to monitor progress
in increasing labor productivitys, controlling operating expenses and improving
management of current assets, ELETROBRAS has agreed that indicators of the
beneficiaries' performance in these areas will be monitored during project
exeoution (paragraph 5.10).

6.06      Constriction expenditures inlude the beneficiaries'1976-79
expansion progrm described lu para. 4.01 (cosiating of the Bank project
and the compleantary works) which repreeents 62% of capital invetment
durizg the period, the cmpletion of on-going works, purchase of facilities,
ancflaery investments not directly related to meeting load growth require-
ments and the initiation of future expansion works. Under the agreement
mentioned in paragraph 6.13, the Bank would be in a position to review a
substantial portion of these inestments before they can be undertaken.
6.07     About 74% on the a-verage of the capital investaent during the
period would be covered by rusouroes contributed directly by power consumrs
(net internal cash generation including reinvestaent of dividends, capital
contributions made by the states and municipaLities with proceeds from the
sole tax and customer contributions in-aid for construction).
6.08     The proposed US$50 million Bank loan would complete the financing
of the project. It would be made to ELUTROBRAS for a torm of 20 years
including 3-1/2 years graoc at the current Bank intereat rate, assumed to be 8.85%.
The loan proceoed, except for those corresponding to that portion of the train-
ing and consulting services (paragraph 4.03) bonefitting the power sector as
a whole and which cost would be borne by ETROBRAS, would be on-lent to the
beneficiaries with the .ae maturity and grace period. ZLETROBRAS would charge
them a one-time coiiasion of 1/2% on the loan mount and a service fee of 1/4%
p.a. on the disbursed mounts during the disbursement period and of 1/8% p.a.
thereafter (2.0%, 1.0%, mad 0.5%, respectively, are its normal charges). Debt
service payomnts would be madu by the beneficiaries to 3IZTROAS on terms
substantially equal to IEaTROBRAS' payments to the Bank but each in amounts
proportional to its participation in the loan disbursements. The beneficiaries
would carry the foreign exchange risk. During negotiations EIETR03RAS and the
beneficiaries agreed on these on-lending terms.
6.09      The goveraent grants shown for CCELBA roprosent expected additional
contributions by the State of Bahia earmarked for rural service xtensions
which are not a part of the Bank project. "Other loans" represent drawdowns
of existing loans for on-going works, and new loans to help finance works
other than the Bank project. In addition to the proposed Bank project, the
beneficiaries' program include approximately US$25 million of foreign exchange
expenditures which are currently planned to be financed from local sources.
ZLETR0BRAS is considering borrowing a part of this mount for foreign exchange
expenditures (other than those financed by the proposed IBRD loan) from foreign
financial institutions. Such funds would be on-lent to the beneficiaries. The
Bank would be prepared to assist ZLKTRORAS in securing better terms for those
borrowings than would otherwise be available, through suitable co-financing
arrangments.  The form of these arrangeoents would be similar to those entered
into in connection with the latest Brazilian steel project. A similar provision
was made in the case of the recently approved COPEL power transmission and
distribution proJect (Loan 1257-ER).

Financial Outlook
6.,0        The beneficiaries' financial projections are reasonable and indicate
a satisfactory financial outlook. Their prospective debt-service coverage
would be adequate and their capital structures would remain strong. However,
the favorable outlooks, including the availability of adequate financial
resources to carry out their expansion programs, depends on the beneficiaries
maintaining themselves qualified to receive the benefits of the cross-subsi-
dization scheme as long as the policy of uniform national power tariffs is
maintained (paragraph 2.13-4).   However, as explained in Annex 13, the
beneficiariesI financial performance would still be satisfactory, since they
would achieve financial rates of return of 8%-i$% during the project period.
These rates of return (referred to as finanieal returns to diatinguish them
from the statutory returns described in Annex 5) do not include transfers
from the Global Ouarantee Fund and contributions to the reversion
fund made by the beneficiaries. While according to current legislation
reversion payments are included as operating expenses for rate setting
purposes, they really are a financial surcharge or tax on utility revenues
and not an actual operating expense as the term is normaly used in public
utility accounting. The States of Bahia, Cear and Pernambuco agreed tbai in
the event there should arise reamons to believe that their respective bene-
ficiary would not have sufficient funds to assure the timely completion of
the Bonk project, they wiil provide them in a form satisfactory to the Bank.
Furthermore, the Federal Government also agreed to make arrangements, satisfac-
tory to the Bank, for funds to be provided to complete the prnject if the
funds available to any of the beneficiaries are insufficient for this
purpose.
6.11        Tb ensure their future operation on a sound financial basis, the
beneficiaries agreed not to incur debt without  the Bsnk'a consent if by
such incurrence their debts would exceed 66.2/3% of their remunerable investment,
and not to incur debt with *n original term of less than 8 year without the
Bank's consent if by so doing the total outstanding principal of such debt
would exceed 5% of total remunerable investment. Similar provisions have been
included in recent loans for electric power in Brasil. In this case, however,
the definitions which are a part of the covenant  were  modified as follows:
first, the term "debt " which has been defined as "any outstanding debt
maturing by its terms after one year from the date in which it is incurred"
would include the substantial interest-bearing obligations of the beneficiaries
which by their terms are repayable on demand at any time by the creditor,
although in practice they remain outstanding on a long-term basis, ("instru-
mentos de reconhecimento de debito" IRD's). And second, borrowing capacity
would be related to remunerable investment, rather than to fixed assets in
operation plus work-in-progress (see psra. 6.12).



- 28 -
6.12         The borrowing capacity of the beneficiaries would be related
to remunerable investments which in turn determine the level of their revenues
and, to a large extent, their internal cash generation. In the case of
the beneficiaries, remunerable investments differ considerably from the
customary fixed assets in operation.  The difference corresponds to
those assets financed by direct contributions from State Governments,
Municipalities and customers.  State Government contributions earmarked
for rural service extensions constitute in fact a reinvestment of the
state share of the sole tax proceeds contributed by electricity consumers.
However, since benefits from such investments usually do not fully accrue
to the power sector but are related inter alia to overall economic development
objectives in the region, DNAZE excludes such investments from the tariff
base. The study on rural service extensions (para.3.13 ) will examine the
economic benefits and the financial implications of such extensions.
6.13        Also, as in the case of similar Bank loans to the Brazilian
electric power sector, the sub-borrowers agreed not to undertake during the
Bank project construction period any major expansion other than the proposed pro-
ject and the complementary works without giving the Bank evidence that (a)such expansion
is economically Justified, taking into account inter alia the economic
development objectives in the region in which the project is located; (b)
adequate financial resources for carrying it out are available; and (c)
the expansion has been approved by DNARE. Fbr this purpose, a major expansion
is one whose cost exceeds 1% of remunerable investment.

7. AGRED4ENTS REACHED AND REOOHHEDWATIONS
7.01       During negotiations agreement was reached on the following principal
pointss
(a) in the event the beneficiaries would need transfers from the Global
Guarantee Fund, they would maintain their eligibility for such
transfers (paragraph 2.14);
(b) the beneficiaries' earnings (inclusive of transfers from the Global
Guarantee Fund) would be maintained at levels consistent with sound
financial and public utility practices and in accordance with existing
legislation; any change  in legislation which would materially
and adversely affect the beneficiaries' financial position would be
an event of default (paragraph 2.15);
(c) that terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank and the results of the
tariff  stuywhich the Goverment intends to have carried out by DNAEE with
the participation of ELETROERAS would be presented to the Bank (para-
graph 2.18),
(d) ELETROERAS, CELPE and COELCE would prepare and carry out an  improvement
program for the financial functions of CELPE and COELCE (paragraph 3.08);
(e) that consultants acceptable to the Bank will continue to be employed
to assist the beneficiaries in matters relating to procurement
(paragraph 3.09);
(f) ELETRDBRAS will prepare a training program for the beneficiaries'
technical staff (paragraph 3.11);
(g) the Government will carry out a study of a general regulation on
system extensions (paragraph 3.13);
(h) ELETROBRAS will carry out a study of lower cost design standards for
areas of low-consumption density (par.graph 3.14);
(i) the beneficiaries will carry out a pilot program to extend service to
low-income consumers (paragraph 3.18);
(J) that the borrower and the beneficiaries will continue to have their finan-
cial statements audited yearly by independent auditors acceptable
to the Bank (paragraph 3.19);
(k) that in the event there should arise reasons to believe that their
respective beneficiary would not have sufficient funds to assure the
timely completion of the Bank project,  the States of Bahia, Cear&
or Pernambuco, as relevant, and, ultimately, the Federal Government,
will provide them in a form satisfactory to the Bank (paragraph 6.10);



- 30 -
(1) that the beneficiaries shall not incur debt without the Bankts
concurrence if by such incurrence their debt would exceed 66-2/3%
of their remunerable investments; and not incur debt with an
original term of less than 8 years if by so doing the total out-
standing principal of such debt would exceed 5% of their
remunerable investments (para. 6.11); and
(m) that the beneficiaries shall not carry out any major expansion
without first giving the Bank evidence that the expansion is
economically justified, that adequate financial resources for
carrying out are available and that it has been approved by DNAEE.
For this purpose, a major expansion is one whose cost exceeds
1% of remunerable investment (paragraph 6.13).
7.02   A condition for disbursement in respect of any beneficiary would be
that the Bank has received evidence that all necessary approvals or ratifications
for the validity of the agreements relating to such beneficiary's participation
in the project have been given.
7.03  With agreement on the above, the project would constitute a suitable
basis for a Bank loan of US$50 million for a tenm of 20 years including 3-1/2
years of grace, to be on-lent to the beneficiaries (with the exception of up
to US$800,000 to cover the cost of consulting services and training which
would benefit the power sector as a whole) on the tesms and conditions stated
in paragraph 6.08.

CENTRAIS ELETRICAS BRASILEIRAS S. A.
Distribution System Extensions
System Coverage
1.         Table 2 of Annex 2 shows the present coverage of electric service
in the beneficiaries' concession areas. The average coverage of the 3 bene-
ficiaries in large urban centers (more than 100,000 people) is of the order
of 63% and drastically decreases to about 12% in COELBA and CEIPE and 3~ in
COELCE in rural areas or small urban areas (less than 10,000 people). The
most important limitation to extend electric services in new areas is the
lack of financial viability.
Two main types of extension works can be distinguished in dis-
tribution companies of the Northeast:
a) extension of lines requested by specific consumers; and
b) systems extensions requested by municipalities or the state
to serve areas without electric service.
Srstem Extension Criteria
2.         The most frequent situation concerning the first type is the ex-
tension of low-tension lines; this case is regulated by article 139 of Decree
41019 of MME. According to it the concessionaires are obliged to build
such extensions at their own cost if the cost of the extension is equal or
less than 3 times the estimated annual revenue from the new consumers. If
this condition is not met the prospective consumer may supplement the
necessary funds and this additional funds are not included in the rate base.
For financing mid-tension (34.5 or 13.8 kV) extensions of the type (a),
although not regulated by decree, the beneficiaries generally follow
article 139.
3.         For the construction of the second type of extensions (case b)
the utilities analyze the expected revenue vis-a-vis the required investment.
At this electrification stage of the beneficiaries concession area, practically
aIl requested new extensions do not meet the test of article 139 and there are
no uniform criteria to decide about which requested extension should be accepted.



ANNEX 3
Paeo 2 f 4
CELPE and COELCE basically decide on the basis of the proportionof the cost
of the extension covered by financial resources made available by the
state and municipalities, which provide special funds for what is called
"obras pioneras" U/ making use of the sole tax charged to the consumers (para.
5   of Annex 5 ). COELBA,on the other hand, decides on the expected discounted
rate of return for a period of 10 years of operation and does not approve
the requested extension if such rate of return is below 12%, regardless the
fact that the extension works may be fully financed by funds for "obras
pioneras" or other sources.
h.         COELBAJs test aeems more reasonable although the expected rate
of return limit could be reduced to 10% in line with Brazilian present
legislation on power system investment. A general regulation on system
extensions appears necessary and it is recomended that DNAEE and ELETROBRAS
carry out a study on this matter.
Desin Standarda
5.         One important step that would make future system extensions more
financially viable and in this way increase electric service coverage in the
Northeast, would be a systematic study directed to invesment cost reductions
in design of mediuam-tension lines and substations for areas of low density
consumption such as in most rural areas, villages or urban areas where low-
income population lives. In ome examples examined during the appraisal, it
was found that economies could be achieved by modifying some basic planning
concepts, even at some reduction of service reliability, but compatible with
safety requirements. For this purpose several aspects should be investigated
such as making wider use of single phase distribution system adopting higher
subtransmission voltage levels and use of voltage regulators, instead of in-
creasing conductor sizes in long mid-tension distribution extensions (50 km
or more) which at present are designed at 13.8 k., and use smaller size
distribution transformers in light loaded circuits. Discussions with locaL
equipment manufacturers could also result in lower investnent cost through
simplification of designs and adaptation of specifications to their production
facilities. All these aspects should be studied with assistance of experienced
consultants on power supply for low-density areas.
Connection of Low-Income Consumers
6.         In the periphery of large cities and in villages located in the
interior of the Northeast states there are an undetermined number of house-
holds without electric service in areas with low-tension lines at their
doors. The main reason for auch situation is the householders' lack of
economic resources to finance their household wiring and connection fee and
to pay the electric consumption.

ARME 3

7.         A pilot plan has been devised to assist householders that do not
have resources for paying the connection fee and interior wiring but are
in a position to spend a moderate proportion of their income in paying the
electric bill. For such purpose it has been agreed with the beneficiaries
to promote this plan which would consist of:
a) exempt   the low-income consumers from payment of connection
fee. For these cases the cost of connection between the low-
tension line and the household would be incorporated to the
rate base;
b) financing a minimum interior wiring installation which
will be repaid to the beneficiaries in monthly install-
ments added to the electric bill.
In table below, an estimate of the minimum monthly income of the
households eligible for this plan has been calculated under the assumption
that during the period of repayment of the interior wiring installation
the consumer would not devote more than 3% of his monthly income in paying
the electric bill, which results in a figure varying between US$75 and US$
98 per month.

years by the Water Code as amended from time to time. Regulatory powers
have been vested in the Ministry of Mines and Energy, which since 1969 has been
exercising its authority through the National Department of Water and
Electric Energy (DNAEE).
3.        Since the adoption of the Water Code in 19343, electricity tariffs
have been based on a service-at-cost principle. Noteworthy amendments have
been:  the introduction in 1941 (Decreto-Lei No. 3128) of a rate of return
on assets of up to 10%; the introduction in 1957 (Decreto No. 41019) of the
concept of a "guaranteed" rate of return on the historic asset cost; the
authorization in 1964 (Decreto No. 54938) to revalue assets to reflect price
level changes; the making in 1966 (Lei No. 5073) of such asset revaluation
mandatory; the raising in 1971 (Lei No. 5655) of the allowed rate of return on
revalued "remunerable assets" (see paragraph 12) from 10% to 12% at DNAEEts
discretion; the introduction in 1973 (Lei 5899) of the concept of cross-
subsidization; and the enactment into law in 197h (Decreto-Lei 1383) of the
objective of tariff equalization.
4.        The guiding force in the evolutirm of Brazilian tariff legislation
has been recognition of the need to mobilize massive financial resources
through consumer charges to support sector growth. A noteworthy departure
was in 1959-1963--the period of rampant inflation-- when tariff levels were
allowed to lag substantially behind soaring price levels, with the result
that sector expansion came to a virtual halt, particularly the extension
of the distribution netwwrks. With the implementation of asset revaluation
in 1904-1966, sector development gathered the momentum which produced the

impressive 10.1% average annual growth in installed capacity over the
last decade to keep abreast of growth in gross electricity consumption of 9.2k
over the periodr-12.3h annually over the last five years,
5.        In 1973 the tariff authorities began implementing a government
policy intended to reduce regional inequalities and to promote, over the
longer run, a more geographically balancea economic growth. To achieve
this objective, tariffs are being set coll-ctively within regions rather
thar. by utility as had been done heretofore. This collective rate setting
was also designed to induce gains in operating efficiency. When the rate
unification effort was well underway, however, Brazil was confronted with
the energy crisis and the attending generalized price inflation and
tightening of world financial markets. Rekindled domestic inflation together
with the fact that electricity tariff levels in any given year reflect asset
revaluation coefficients for the proceding year, caused tariff increases in
1973 and 1974 to again lag substantially behind the general price increases.
The reference price for kWh for the whole of Brazil excluding surcharges
(tarifa fiscal - see para. 1h) decreased from about US$3.6 cents in 1972 to
US$2.9 cents in 197h. The lower revenues together with rapidly increasing
operating costs brought about a liquidity squeeze, which became particularly
acute in those utilities engaged in the construction of large generation
projects characterized by long-gestation periods and which faced substantial
project cost overruns. This also caused returns on remunerable assets for
the comparatively higher cost/financially less eficient utilities well below
the 10% minimum. Although tariff legislation provides that the shortfalls
may be carried forward to be offset over time against future surplus returns,
the magnitude of the shortfalls and their widespread occurrence rendered this
practice incongruent with the service-at-cost system.
6.        Sector finances were also affected since, as will be seen later,
overall sector revenues vary in direct proportion to changes in the average
price per kWh. Sector revenues decreased at the time when they were most
needed and when it became increasingly difficult to secure borrowings on
suitable terms. Overall sector revenues decreased from Cr$8.2 billion in
1973 to Cr$7.5 billion in 1974, both expressed in 1974 cruzeiros.
7.        Faced with (a) an expected growth in electricity consumption at an
even higher rate (13% p.a.) than in the last decade and (b) little prospects
of favorable changes in the world panorama in the foreseeable future, and
convinced that the most appropriate means of achieving an orderly, increasing
utilization of Brazilts vast hydroelectric potential is through the maintenance
of a realistic pricing policy assuring the sector an adequate supply of long-
tenm resources commensurate with its massive investment requirements, the
Brazilian authorities adopted the following principal measures:
(i) the granting of gradual tariff increases at higher rates than
those affecting the domestic general price level, and which in
1975 caused the reference price per kWh to develop as follows:

4th Quarter               30.3                3.314
(ii) the granting, beginning July 1, 1975, of discounts equivalent
to 20% for residential consumers within the 30 kWh/month
minimum consumption, and to 10% for low-tension rural
consumers.
(iii) the freezing until 1983 at the 1974 level (32.5A) of the
compulsory loan (see paragraph 15) rate applicable to industrial
consumers, which was on an annually declining scale until its
elimination in 19814.
(iv) the establishment of a cross-subsidization mechanism, the
"Guarantee Fund", to harmonize the rate equalization effort
with the service-at-cost principle. This is accomplished
by the funding of the "Guarantee Fund" through a surcharge of
up to 2% on assets in operation and using the proceeds to
supplement tariff revenues to increase the returns of qualifying
utilities earning less than the 10) minimum.
(v) the adoption by DNABE of a number of strict measures aimed at
controlling the operating efficiency of those concessionaires
benefitting from the cross-subsidization mechanism, including
the rationalization of their investments and the maximization
of the use of sector revenues to meet sector expansion require-
ments. Utilities falling under these measures, mostly
distribution companies, are restricted from increasing their
operating costs, undertaking investments and expanding their
markets without DNAE's prior approval, and their majority
governmental shareholders must maintain their service accounts
current and reinvest their dividends.
(vi) the standardization of straight line depreciation at mandatory
rates of year-end gross fixed assets of 5% (up to 5% previously)
for thermal installations and 3% (up to 3%) for hydro instal-
lations and other equipment.
8.       In addition, ELETROBRAS is seeking that it be permitted to continue
to utilize a high proportion of the federal governmentts share of the sole
tax., which according to present legislation is to be transferred in annually
increasing proportions to other sectors through the recently created National
Development Fund (paragraph 14).
9.        This is the first time that DNAEE has set out to exercise its
controlling powers in a comprehensive mamer. In preparation for this
task DNAZE has been strengthening its staff with-tariff specialists drawn
mainly from the concessionaires# ranks.

The Present Tariff Level System
10.       The law provides that tariffs s1dould be set at such levels as
to cover:
(a) operating, maintenance and administrative expenses;
(b) taxes other than on income (mainly property taxes);
(c) foreign exchange losses arising from the service of borrowings
in foreign exchange;
(d) straight line depreciation of estimated year-end gross fixed
assets in operation (land excluded) at the mandatory rates
already mentioned (point vi, paragraph 7);
(e) reversion (defined in paragraph 11) of between 3% and 5  of the
estimated year-end utility plant in service, less the sum of
accumulated advances, contributions and grants ("investimento
reversivel"); and
(f) a legal return ("remunera.ao legal") of up to 12% of remunerable
investment ("investimento remuneravel", defined in paragraph 12),
at DNAEE's discretion.
II.       Beginning January 1975, (Decreto-Lei 1383) reversion ("Reserva Global
de Reversao") consists of:
(a) a tax levied by the Federal Government to secure funds to com-
pensate private concessionaires for their assets when their
concessions revert to, or are taken over by, the Government.
This tax currently amounts to 3% of the corresponding asset
base ("investimento reversivel", defined in the previous para-
graph). Its proceeds are administered by EE¶TROE)AS, which
channel the funds to support investments by the public conces-
sionaires, mostly by the large, federally-owned generation
concessionaires; and
(b) the contributions to the Guarantee Fund (mentioned in point (iv)
of paragraph 7), a redistributive mechanism made necessary by
the rate equalization effort, whereby tariff revenues are
channelled from the more financially efficient utilities to those
which achieve a return (before this transfer) below the 12P
minimum. All utilities are subject to this contribution, which
may be of up to 2A of the reversion base at DNAEE's discretion.
Monthly transfers from this fund are only authorized to those
qualifying utililities which, on a month-to-month basis, submit
evidence satisfactory to DNAEE of their adherence to the con-
trolling measures mentioned in point (v) of paragraph 7.



Pago 5 of 11
12.       Remunerable investment ("investimento remuneravel") is calculated
as the difference between:
(a) the sum of:
(i) the revalued gross book value of the utility plant in
service 3/;
(ii) an allowance for inventory;
(iii) an allowance for other net working capital items; and
(b) (i) accumulated (revalued) depreciation and amortization V/;
(ii) the year-end surplus/(deficit) arising from the difference
of prior year's actual returns and the allowed legal returns;
(iii)  the year-end sum of advancea, contributions and grants.
13.       Sector legislation provides that concessionaires should apply to
DNAEE every three years for a revision of their tariff level. Up through
1974, revisions were made annually on the basis of applications prepared
by the concessionaires using asset revaluation coefficients prepared by
Government authorities, reflecting price level changes during the preceding
year. Concessionaires were authorized to add interim surcharges to the
basic tariff approved by DNAEE to compensate for increases in wages, social
benefits, fuel costs, cost of purchased power and increases in foreign ex-
change debt service arising from fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates.
Beginning in 1975, tariff level adjustments are made entirely at DUAEE's
initiative, based not on the concessionaires' actual tariff calculations as
before, but on selected cost and investment data which all concessionaires
must now sutmit on a monthly basis to DNAEE. In 1975 four general tariff
increases were authorized by DNAEE (January, June, September and December).
Other Charges
B. The Sole Tax (Imposto lJnico. IUEE)
14.       This is tax originally imposed to provide additional financial
resources for the sector. Since 1972 (Lei 5655) this tax applies to commercial
and residential consumers only. The rates applicable are 60% (commercial
consumers) and 50% (residential consumers) of the "tarifa fiscal", a country-
wide reference electricity tariff calculated every three months by DNAEE.
Consumers not reaching the minimum 30 kWh/month level are exempt for this tax.
3 UP to 1975 DNAEE had accepted year-end values, but it is now adjusting them
to reflect the period of time plant added during the year has been in operation.
/ Amortization was charged instead of reversion before 1971. Its accumulated
value as of that year, as revalued, is kept on utilities' books and treated
as a deduction from plant in source. Reversion is not treated in this wqy.



ANNEX 5

Page 6of 11
The proceeds from this tax are distributed 40% to Federal agencies, 50% to
the States and 10% to the municipalities. The funds returned to the States
are prorated among them on the basis of their area (20%), their population
(60%), their electric power generation (2%), their electricity consumption
(15%) and their total flooded areas (reservoirs) (3%). Through 1973, the
funds allocated to Federal agencies were distributed as follows: ELETROERAS
(37%)) DNAFE (2%), and Ministry of Nines and Energy - NME (1%). Beginning
in 1 97, the funds allocated to the sector are on the following declining
scale (%):
ELETOBRA       ME       National Development Fund
1974                     36.0        4.0%               -
1975                     32.4        3.6               4.0
1976                     28.8        3.2               8.0
1977                     25.2        2.8              12.0
1978                     21.6        2.4              16.0
1979 on                  18.o        2.0              20.0
Thus, the direct share of the sector in the portion allocated to the Federal
Goverrment is to be reduced by 50% over a five-year period; some of the
proceeds accruing to the National Development Fund are budgetted for the
ITAIPU bi-national project and ELElROEAS intends to apply for further
appropriations from the fund for that sector.
C. The Compulsory Loan (Emprestimo Compulsorio)
15.       This forced investment scheme was also established to supplement
sector resources and, like the sole tax, is based on the "tarifa fiscal"
mentioned in the previous paragraph. It applies to industrial consumers
only, at the rate of 32.5% from 1975 to 1983 as currently established by
Law (previously at 35$ until 1974 and on an annually declining scale until
its elimination in 1984, point (iii) of paragraph 7). The law requires that
industrial consumers take 20-year, 6% interest bearing bonds issued by ELETROBRAS,
and which are subject to monetary correction. Compulsory loan proceeds are to
be allocated by EIETROBRAS as follows:
(a) 50% for investment in hycdroelectric plants in the ParanA River
basin, mainly ItaipfG.
(b) 15% for investment in hydroelectric plants in the Sgo Francisco
River basin.
(c) 10% for additional capital subscription in ELETRONORTE, and
(d) 25% for the construction of regional transmission systems in
extra high voltage and in the development of the nuclear power
plant program.

(Previously, 50% of the funds collected from each State had to be invested
in the respective state-owned power distribution concessionaire).
D. Social Security Tax
16.       All consumers are required to pay this tax at the rate of 1% of
their power bills (3% before June 1973).
Financial Impact
17.       The following table shows the average revenue per kWh in Brazil
in 1972:
Cr$d/kWh      US$4/kWh
Concessionaires' revenues (ex-
cluding reversion)                 19.92         2.94          71

Total consumer contribution      28.0                       100
18.       The concessionaires' average revenue (US$2.94 cents/kWh) is
comparable to that experienced in advanced industrialized countries.  The
consumer contributions (US$1.Z0 cents/kWh or L1%) over and above the cost
of service results from the Government policy of having sector finances
rely on stable, internally generated long-term funds, rather than depend
to any sizeable extent on government budget allocations or capital market
resources. The following table summarizes the sectors' (ELETROBRAS and
the concessionaires) sources and applications of funds in 1974 and in
the period 1975-79 (the latter at June 1975 prices) :

ELETROBBAS' Financial Stateaents
1.        This Annex contains the following summarized tables, each covering
the years 1970 to 1975:
Table 1        Balance SheotB
Table 2        Stateents of Income
Table 3        Sources and Appli±tion of Fwnds
2.        Tables 1 and 2 are based on audited statements prepared by ELETROBRAS'
independent auditors, Messrs. Boucinhas, Campos, Coopers & Lybrand. Minor
reclassification of accounts has been made as required to achieve consistency in
the series.
3.        On December 31, 1975, ELETROBRAS' share capital was represented by
14,342,401,580 comon shares and 257,598,420 preferred shares, with a par value
of Cr$1.00 each. The preferred shares have no voting rights and presently yield
a 12% dividend, compared with 9% on the common shares. 99.6% of all the
shares are owned by the Federal Government.
4.        The balance shoots (Table 1) indicate a satisfactory liquidity situation
reflecting a consistently high capital/total debt ratio.
5.        The statemeats of income (Table 2) indicate sustained low operating
costs (ranging from 5% to 7% including depreciation and taxes) and a satisfactory
interest coverage, which has exceeded five times the annual interest charges
over the period (7.1 times in 1975). Net income of Cr$3,675 million in 1975
(about US$440 million equivalent) represented a 18.6% return on average equity.
6.        The Source and Applications of Funds Statements (Table 3) shows a
satisfactory debt service coverage. EIZTROBRASW total requirements were covered
as follows in the period 1970-75s
Net cash generation                     38
Proceeds of energy (sole) tax           10
Reversion                               19
Compulsory loan                        23
Governmnt transfers                      4
Borrowings                               6
100
7.       As noted in Annex 5, ELEROBRAS is supposed to receive a declining
proportion of the proceeds of the sole tax (down from 36% in 1974 to 16% in
1979), but is seeking to be permitted to continue to utilize a high proportion
of the Government's share of this resource. Its other sources of funds should
increase in line with the growth of power sales and are protected against inflation

by the provisions of the Brazilian power legislation. ELETROBRAS should
therefore continue to be in a position to provide a large proportion of
the local currency requirements of major generation and transmission
projects through loans and equity investments in the utilities responsible
for their construction.

BRAZIL
APPRAISAL OF NORTHEAST POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
CENTRAIS ELETRICAS BRASILEIRAS S.AoM(ELETRONAS)
JIJTJSILF1CATION OF THE BENEICIARIES DISTRIBUTION EXPANSION PORM
1.         This Annex is divided into two sections.  The first contains an
analysis of the proposed distribution capacity additions to the system
of each beneficiary, which concludes that the programs are generally
consistent with the expected growth of demand over the program's implementation
period.  The second section contains a cost-benefit analysis, which shows
that the expected rate of return on the proposed investment programs are well
in excess of the opportunity cost of capital in Brazil. This indicates that
electricity prices will, on average, be considerably higher than incremental
sytem costs, suggesting that wasteful use of electricity, and therefore
premature expansion of capacity, will be avoided. Because the project is
an integral part of the beneficiaries' expansion programs, it would be
extremely time-consuming to attempt to justify it in isolation. However,
the high rates of return calculated for the entire program are likely to
hold for its component parts.
2. Distribution Capacity Requirements
2.1        The most useful aggregate measure of distribution capacity is the
MVA of transformer capacity uti4ized to deliver power to consumers at dif-
ferent voltage levels# In the following analysis the transformer capacity
available at the end of the program period has been compared with the peak
demand at that date of loads at different voltage levels and at individual
substations taking into account losses, diversity and necessary reserve.
2.2        To determine load requirements at different transforming stages,
an equivalent power flow diagram has been made for each of the sub-
borrowerts distribution system. The case of OOELBA is particularly complex
as CHESF has more than 5O delivery points at different voltages, plus the
power generated by COELBA's own facilities.  The energy flowing through
transformers was determined from the flow diagram for the configuration ex-
pected in 1979, taking into account energy losses from CHESF's feeding
points to the high-tension side of the 69/13.8 KV and distribution trans-
formers. The table below shows the integrated peak demand at each trans-
formation atage.  This integrated peak demand was determined from the
energy delivered at each voltage level, the load and power factors, losses
and diversity factors, which are also indicated in the table.

2.3        The average load factor of 69 and 13.8 KV loads was estimated on
the basis of a sample of bills of industrial consumers connected at these
voltages, which contain demand and energy information. The load factor for
low tension was derived from the oveuall system load factor, the load factor
of the high and medium-tension levels and diversity factors shown in the
above table, at the end of the project period (December 31, 1979).  The ratio
of installed capacity to peak demand has been computed for the end of the
program period in the following table.

/ Includes deliveries at 6.6 KV

2.4      Ratios of installed capacity to peak demand of 69/13.8 kV sub-
stations of COAELA and CELPE seem adequate considering 20% of transformers
overloading normally accepted.  The higher ratio for COELCE substations
is due to the number of substations in low-density consumption areas where
the installed capacity corresponds to the minimum size of transformers
available. The high ratio for COEIBA's distribution transformers reflects
the high proportion of underground substations and overhead installations
in crowded areas of Salvador where too frequent expansions are difficult
and uneconomical.
2.5       CELPE's ratio of 13.8 kV substations appears too low even
considering overloading, which indicates that their expansion program for
the distribution network is too tight to meet the projected demand. The
Bank recommended that such expansion program should be revised and an
increase of US$10 million to the investment in the complementary works of
the expansion program has been added in the financial projections and economic
return calculations. During negotiations CELPE agreed to carry out this
additional investment using its own resources, which would permit them to
obtain an acceptable value for its ratio: total peak demand to installed
capacity.
2.6       The incremental peak demand during the project period, cost of the
distribution expansion program and unit cost of the program at market prices
are shown below:

OE=LBta higher unit cost over CELPE'a is due to the substatial propwtion
of udrground installations in the distribution stem of Salvador. The
complemnt   works in 0ELCZ I a progrm inold  more thn 500 km of 13.8 5V
distribution lines to integrate their rral sytem and to open now area, with
low-load denity, which account for the high cost of their program. The
above unit costs ar therefore reasonable.
3.  Cost - Benefit Analysis
3.1       Costs and befits were evaluated at prices prevailing in Jun  1975.
The basic assumptios are listed in Table 1 and explained in more detail below.
A shadow price for the exchag  rate of 9.76 Cr$/US$, 1.2 times the financial
rate at time of appraisal ;,/ was adoptd. Oter cost inputs, for example,
skilled and sei-skilled labor cost, which are the main components, were
evaluated at maroet prices as has been considered that the actual market cots
adequately represent their economic value.
,/ Does not include US$11.6 million corresponding to the transmission (139 KW)
system in the interior of the state of Bahia.
I lncludes US$10 million above the amunt shown in the feasibility report, to
cover additional distribution capacity required to met the demand in 1979.

Costs
3.2        The total investment cost and schedule of investments for the
program period (project plus other works commissioned during the project
period) are shown in the first part of table 1. The marginal cost of operating
and maintenance (0&M) has been evaluated at 6% the investment cost of works
in operation of the sub-borrowers' expansion program. The beneficiaries will
purchase the power to be distributed by the works included in the program
from CHESF. To supply this power, CHESF has undertaken a program to expand
its hydroelectric generation capacity and associated transmission facilities,
which is partly financed by IERD Loan 1008-ER. The cost of this program
has been analyzed to estimate the marginal cost of power purchased by each
beneficiary. Section 3 of Table 1 shows the investment cost per KW of
maximum demand for generation and transmission at the main delivery points
to the beneficiaries' cost systems. On this basis, the investment and O&M cost
of generation and transmission has been calculated and shown in Table 2.
Benefits
3.3        Because prices charged by electric power utilities are regulated
rather than being determined by market prices, they may not reflect the full
benefits received by consumers. However, it has not been possible to estimate
the additional social and economic benefits not reflected in revenues, and it
has been assumed that the price paid by the ultimate consumer is a measure
of the minimut benefits obtained from the program. The average total cost
per kWh paid by the consumer is shown in Table 1 and consists of the average
price of energy plus the "sole taxw (see para.    of Annex   ).  The benefits
are measured by the incremental sales attributable to the program, assuned to
be equal to sales growth in the beneficiaries' systems from January 1, 1977
through June 30, 1900, and assui=ng that it would take 6 months to put the
works into service after t4e equipment is on site.
3.4        Part of the program works commissioned  during the period, consists
of transmission lines and substatlons of 138, 69 KV and 34.5 KV, which will
not be fully utilized until about 1985, therefore a residual value of this
part of the program has been deducted from investment in 1980. Table 2 shows
the projection   of cost and benefit extended through the project life for
the investment program of each beneficiary, together with the equalzing
discount rate. According to it, the equalizing return for cOELBA is 16.5%,
for CELFE is 18%, and for COLC  16%. if investment and operating costs
inacrease by 10% the equalizing returns will be 15.4%, 16.7% and 15.0%, for
CRLBA, CI3LI: and CMLC3 respectively. If bonefits decrease by 10%, the equa-
lizing return will respectively be: 14.3%, 15.0% and 14.5%. The econoic -
return for the throe  boneficiaries' ambined progrm  is expected to be 16.9%,
with a 10% increase ia investment and operating costs it would be 15.7% and with
a 10% decrease in sales it would be 14,.7%.

Introduction
1.*      This Annex contains details on the beneficiaries' finances which,
tegether with the following financial tables, supplement the analysis in
Section 6 of th. text:
Table 1 - Selected Financial Indicators 1972-79
Table 2 - Cost of Service 1972-79
Table 3 - Income Statements 1972-79
Table 4 - Balance Shoets 1972-79
Table 5 - Log-tern debt, 12/31/74
Table 6 - Financial Charges on Long-term Debt, 1975-79
Table 7 - Amortization o-f Lag-term Debt, 1975-79
Table 8 - Soures and Applications of hmds 1975-79
2.       Attachmet 1 contains notes an the financial statements and the
assumptions  derlying the forecasts.
Financial Position ad Performance
3.       The beneficiaries' finacial position as reflected in the financial
iadicators shon in Table 1 is satisfactory. The rates of return on average
net fied assets in operation for 1974 were 10.4, 13.0 and 8.7 for OOELBA,
CUI   and C0UL0, respectively. These rates of return (referred to as financial
returns to distinguish thm frm the statutory returns described in Anex 5)
do not include reversion payments and trasfers from the Guarantee Fund in the
aemputation of operatizg incom. While reversion is included in operating expenses
for rate setting purpose, it is really a financial surcharge or tax on utility
revenues and not an actua  oeting expense as the term is normally ued in
public utility accounting.
4.       The beeficiarie  have not charged uniform depreciation rates on their
fied as"ts in operation following a prviouly generalized practice in the power
sector, and some of their charges my not have been in accordane with sound utility
practices prior to 1974 (Table 1). However, DIR  bas now standardised depre-
ciation rates for a  Brasilian utilities at satisfactory levels (see Annex 5,
para. 7 (vi) and future depreciatio  chargs should be adequate. The 1973-74



ANNEX 13
Page 2 of 3
financial rates of return shown in Table 1 have been calculated using a notional
depreciation rate of 3% of average gross fixed assets in operation.
5.        For the project period (1976-1979), the average financial return
for the three beneficiaries would be: COELBA: 9.8%; COELCE: 8.8%; and CELPE:
14.4%.  These rates of return are before reversion payments ana receipts
from the Guarantee Fund and are satisfactory.
6.        As shown by the various financial ratios in Table 1, the beneficiaries
present a sound financial structure characterized by a large equity base.
7.        The bcneficiaries' operating ratios (operating costs relative to the
sum of operating revenues and receipts from the Guarantee Fund) have been
rising significantly in recent years. At the time of appraisal they were
estimated at 31i for COELBA and CELPE and 34% for COELCE in 1975.  These
levels are relatively high for Brazilian standards and need watching.
ELETROBRAS agrees. Over the project period average operating ratios would be
31.54 for COELBA, 3O6 for CELPE and 33% for COELCE. While this is only a
meager improvement in absolute terms, they should be acceptable since attainment
of these levels will require substantial management attention given the
increases in average salaries in real terms planned over the forecast period
and the personnel additions needed to support their expanding distribution
networks (see note 22 in Atta4hment 1 to this Annex).
8.        The beneficiaries' borrowing capacity would be related to their
remunerable investments which determine the level of their revenues (Annex 5)
and, to a large extent, their internal cash generation and debt service
coverage. This is necessary because the beneficiaries' remunerable investment
(the asset base for statutory return purposes - see Table 2) differs considerably
from the customary net fixed assets in operation principally because of the
exclusion of those assets which have been financed by direct contributions
and grants from the Federal and State Governments, Municipalities and
customers. In 1974 the proportion of these assets to total net fixed assets
in operation ranged from 15% (CELPE) to 24% (COELBA).
Amortization and Reversion Reserves and Reversion Payments
9.        Up to January 1972, Brazilian legislation required power utilities
to provide, in addition to depreciation, for an amortization reserve calculated
as a percentage of gross operating assets. Such reserve was then replaced
by "reversion" contributions to an interutility fund, the "Global Reversion
Fund" administered by ELETROBRAS. This fund provided ELETROERAS with
resources to support and coordinate sector investments of national interest.
Since January 1975, reversion contributions have been increased and the
excess over 3% is allocated to an interutility compensatory scheme, called
"Global Guarantee Fund" (Reserva Global de Garantia). Eligible power companies
receive transfers from this Guarantee Fund so that they can attain up to a
10% return on remunerable assets. During the project period (1976-79) the
beneficiaries would contribute Cr$397.1 million in reversion payments   while

Net Reversion Payments        105.2   148.1       (38.9)       214.4
Accounts R-ceivable - Customers
10.       As explained in para. 6.03 of the text, the beneficiaries should
improve the management of their accounts receivable.  It is expected that
the receivables' average collection period will be lowered to the levels
shown in Table 1 of this annex because for a benfficiary to qualify for
transfers from the Guarantee Fund, the respective State Government should
maintain its service account current or enter into a binding agreement
with the utility providing for the settlement of overdue amounts at DNAEE's
satisfaction (Annex 5, para. 7(v)). As mentioned in para. 2.14 and 6.11, the
beneficiaries have agreed that they would, if transfers from the Guarantee Fund
are required, maintain their entitlement to such transfers.
Fizancing Plan - Price Escalation
11.       The financing plan presented in para. 6.04 of the reports is in
constant June 1975 prices and consequently does not include price contingencies.
To cover price escalation, adiditional funds will be required as follows:

their State contributions and capital resources (sole tax - IUEE) in line
with inflation, allowing them to cover approximately Cr$400 million of the
additional requirements for funds shown above. The beneficiaries should have no
difficulty in arranging additional borrowings (including the proposed co-
financing (see para.6.09 of the text) to cover the balance of approximately
Cr$58 million.

NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS
1.        Financial statements for the 1972-1974 period are based on the bene-
ficiaries' audited reports which values are stated at the corresponding current
cruzeiros. Daring 1972 COELCE took over a number of companies and, there are
no consolidated financial statements for that year available.
2.        As it is customary for Brazilian utilities, forecast statements for
the 1975-1979 period are in constant June 1975 cruzeiros. This is acceptable
since current tariff legislation (see Annex 5) allows for tariff increases to
reflect price level changes. Forecasts are based on the assumption that the
principles of the tariff legislation and their current application will be
maintained during the project period.
3.        Utility plant in service includes monetary correction.  The amounts
used by COELBA and COELCE to calculate their remunerable investment correspond
to their gross fixed assets in operation. However, the differences with utility
plant in service which excludes assets not being utilized is not material.
4.        Depreciation reserve was transferred from the equity account to
the corresponding assets. For calculation, see Annex 5, para. 3(b).  Depreciation
values through 1975 include monetary correction. Forecast depreciation was
computed on "depreciable assets" (which exclude land) at the rates set by law
(see Annex 5, para. 7(vi)).
5.        Ca ital resources consist of capital contributions arising from sole
tax reinveisEmen Ty sa eand municipal governments, as follows:

6.        The allowance for working capital in set annually by 1NAEE in
accordance with the law. Since 1975 it is calculated as the sum of the monthly
average of inventories and of other net working capital items (excluding the
current portion of long-term debt), plus the year-end cash balance to the extent
it does not exceed the reserve for depreciation.
7.        Sales forecast for the beneficiaries were projected using the
electricity rate. in effect in June 1975 (DNAEE, Portaria 042 - June 12, 1975),
except where they produced a return on remunerable investment in excess of 10%,
in which case rates were assumed to be set at a level sufficient to earn 10%.
The June 1975 rates were not sufficient in some years to earn the assumed 10%
return. For those years, it was assumed that transfes would be received fromM
the Guarantee Fund.
8.        Forecast fixed asset accounts reflect the expansion program discussed
in Section 4 of the text, as follows:

9.        Accounts receivable were proj_ cted as a function of sales volume
allowing for improvement in collection periods (Annex 3, para. 5), as follows:
-Average collection period in days--
1975    1976    197     1978    197
COELBA                    56       50      49      48      44

CELPE                     46       45      45      45      45
In all cases, the average collection period includes one month of unbilled sales.
Audited balance sheets were reclassified to transfer the reserve for doubtful
accounts from the equity account.
10.       Materials and supplies were projected as a function of the utility plant
in service, allowing for moderate decreases in their level (see text, para. 6.03).
11.       Income Tax: The beneficiaries (and CHESF, the bulk power supplier in the
Northeast) are specifically exempt from income tax.
12.       Dividends were calculated based on the beneficiaries' current dividend
rates, as follows:
COELBA       CELPE        COELCE
Stock
Conmon                      6%            6%            6%
Preferred                  10%           10%            6;
The projections assume that dividends payable to the state governments will be
reinvested in capital stock. Dividends payable to ELETROBRAS were assumed to
be reinvested only in the case of COEICE.
13.       In the calculation of the beneficiaries' remunerable investment cash
(all three beneficiaries) and receivable (COELCE) allowances were not included
following the particular beneficiary's practice since, at the time of appraisal,
DNAEE had not issued the corresponding regulations.

23.      Labor expenses were projected as a function of the number of consuners,
allowing for some productivity improvements. The average employee compensation
is expected to increase substantially during 1975-1976 as the beneficiaries
implement the Government policy to bring power sector salary levels more in
line with those of other sectors in the Northeast. From then on, further increases
correspond to moderate productivity improvements and seniority allowances. The
detailed personnel forecast is as follows:

design with emphasis in designs for rural areas as required to help it carry
out the studies on lower investment cost distribution designs to serve areas
of low-density loads. The main subjects to be investigated are given in
paragraph 5 of Annex 3. The results of these studies should be reflected in
standard designs for distribution systea and equipment specifications which
should be adopted by the beneficiaries and other Brazilian utilities.
1.2       A foreign tariff specialist would be employed to assist DNAEE in the
study of tariff structures (paras. 2. 17-8 of the text).
2.        Consulting services of interest to the beneficiaries
2.1       The use of consultants for assisting the beneficiaries in the
procurement process (preparation of bidding documents, publication, bid
evaluation, inspection) is expected to save time and reduce costs as purchases
can be made in larger lots, combining requirements of the three beneficiaries.
2.2       Similarly, the beneficiaries should be able to achieve economies
in using specialized engineering consultants for the project through
ELETROBRAS' coordination of the work programs of such experts.
3.        Training Program
The training component of the loan will consist of:
(i) overseas fellowships for selected staff members of DNAZE
who would receive training in tariff and regulatory policy,
and for members of the beneficiaries' technical staff; and
(ii) coursea to be organized by ELETROBRAS at the training centers
of the beneficiaries.
In the latter, technical and financial staff of the beneficiaries and of
other distribution companies would receive training in public utility operations}
distribution system planning; participation of power distribution in integrated
urban, rural or regional planning; financial planning and control; and personnel
management.
1/ See annex 7 for the timing of the various services financed by
the loan.

4.        Cost Estimates
The estimated unit cost of consultant services is based on market
prices for services of individual experts belonging to cosulting firm  or
organizationas required for the type of work envisaged in the above-mentioned
program. Their cost, therefore, could be substantilly higher than the
average cost per man-month of regular engineering studies of the sort where a
large number of individuals of different profesional levels are required.
