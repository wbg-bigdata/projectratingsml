MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDiT TO
THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKE;TAN FOR A
PRIVATE TUBEWELL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit for SDR 26.3 million (US$34.4 million equivalent) to the Islamic
Republic of Pakistan, is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms with 35 years maturity to help finance a Private
Tubewell Development Project.
Background
2.       Despite agriculture's declining share in the overall economy, the
sector accounts for 222 of GDP, employs 522 of the labor force, and generates
551 of total export earnings. The significant improvement in agricultural
performance during the last decade stems from the positive response of farmers
to the government's policies and programs for stimulating agricultural
production. These measures include the rationalization of agricultural
pricing policy, and broadening the availability of inputs, such as high-
yielding seed varieties, irrigation water, fertilizers, and credit. More
recently, under the Sixth Plan, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) has put more
emphasis on reducing subsidies, developing agricultural research and extension
services, upgrading the seed industry, improving on-farm water management,
increasing farm mechanization, rehabilitating canals and drains, and further
extending rural electrification.
3.       The development of water resources in Pakistan has been a joint
public and private effort. While the public sector provided the major
infrastructure-storage dams, canals, and horizontal and vertical drainage to
prevent waterlogging and salinity-the private sector contributed to the
development of groundwater resources by installing private tubewells (TWs) in
fresh groundwater areas (FGW). In 1979, the Government issued the UNDP-
financed and Bank-executed study, the "Revised Action Programme for Irrigated
Agriculture" (RAP). The RAP concluded that future development of FGW areas
should be left to the private sector while the public sector would continue
its program in saline water zones. In the National Agricultural Policy
statement issued in 1980, the GOP reaffirmed its commitment to promote private
TW development in FGW areas. This policy was implemented throughout the Sixth
Five-Year Plan (FY84-88), and has since continued. The proposed project
evolved from GOP's continued effort to induce the private sector to actively
participate in the development of FGW.



-2-
4.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Since 1952, the Bank has assisted the
Government of Pakistan in: (a) financing a series of agricultural and water
sector projects; (b) formulating a balanced investment program that would
ensure selection of priority programs and allocation of adequate resources
with a view to increasing agricultural productivity; (c) improving the
formulation and implementation of effective agricultural pricing policies; and
(d) mobilizing additional resources, through improved cost recovery, that
would help finance priority investment programs/projects. The sector strategy
and programs grew out of a strengthened technical and policy dialogue with the
Bank. The Agricultural Sector Adjustment Loan (Ln. 2986-PAK), the Bank's most
recent operation in agriculture, was formulated with a view to promoting
agricultural productivity by focusing public and private sector investments in
high priority projects, and phasing out fertilizer and irrigation operation
and maintenance (0&M) subsidies. An important element in the reduction of
irrigation O&M subsidy is the agreement on a plan of action to privatize
existing public TWs in FGW areas, and promoting private TWs in the remaining
FGW areas. Since the proposed project is the first pilot operation following
the adoption of the O&M cost recovery program under ASAL, and given the
importance of IDA's role in promoting privatization of public TWs, it is
important for IDA to remain associated with TW development in the near
future. IDA's involvement in the proposed project would ensure that the
erging lessons would be adequately monitored and evaluated to develop a
least cost private TW investment program for the remaining FGW areas.
5.       Project Objectiv2s.  The primary objective of the proposed pilot
project is to test the viability of an integrated private TW development
program for increasing agricultural production by: (a) providing reliable
supplementary irrigation water to farmers; (b) controlling and preventing
waterlogging; and (c) improving agricultural and water management practices.
These objectives would be achieved through the provision of a coordinated
incentive package of electrification, credit, and supporting services to
predominantly small farmers to promote investment in TWa, which have proved to
be one of the most effective means of controlling watertable and providing
reliable and timely irrigation water. The project would also contribute to
improving the living standards in the project area through the extension of
electricity service to villages and small agro-industrial units.
6.       Prolect Description.  The proposed project, which is the first
government effort to facilitate the development of intensive private TW
installation in FGW areas in Pakistan, would consist of (a) a complete
distribution network adequate to extend electricity to about 8,000 TNs, and
infrastructure for about 200 villages and 300 agroindustry units, and
implementation of a pilot load management scheme for 500 existing TWs to
minimize TW operation during peak electricity demand hours; (b) improvement of
320 watercourses (out of the total provincial program comprising 680
watercourses) and establishment of pilot pressurized irrigation schemes;
(c) technical assistance to provide needed expertise for the implementing
agencies and to train project staff; and (d) engineering and office
equipment. The installation of the TWs would be financed by farmers by
availing themselves of funds from the Agricultural Development Bank of
Pakistan. Lining of selected minors and irrigation system improvements in the
project areas would be financed under an ongoing canal rehabilitation program
(Cr. 1888-PAK).

7.       Agreed Actions.  IDA has obtained agreements from GOP, Water and
Power Development Authority (WAPDA), and Government of Punjab (GOPunjab) that
they would take the following actions. Prior to Credit effectiveness, the
Project Proforma (PC-1) would be approved by the Executive Committee of the
National Economic Council (ECNEC). Other agreed actions include: (i) WAPDA to
review with IDA the findings and recommendations of the review and analysis of
WAPDA's design and construction standards and pilot load management scheme and
prepare an implementation plan by June 30, 1989; (ii) WAPDA to recruit project
consultants by August 31, 1989; (iii) WAPDA to charge the full tubewell
connection charges; and (iv) GOPunjab to recover from beneficiaries 252 of the
cost of materials for watercourse improvement works.
8.       Benefits.  The proposed project would benefit 26,000 farm families.
The project components (para. 6) would facilitate private sector investments
in TWs and would give farmers control of groundwater resources for timely and
reliable supplementary irrigation supplies, while also controlling water-
logging. The additional water availability would permit farmers to increase
cropping intensity by 40% and, coupled with improved water management and
cropping practices, would increase agricultural production and promote crop
diversification. The project's estimated economic rate of return is 25%. The
project would also provide important lessons for designing similar FGW
development projects in other areas of Pakistan.
9.       Proiect Risks.  The proposed project does not entail any unusual
risk.  The TW technology is widely known in Pakistan and its adoption by
farmers of the project areas would be accelerated, provided that electricity
service and credit are made available to them. Among the risks facing the
project is a possible failure in coordination of project implementation.
Farmers would be frustrated if electric connections are not provided on time
after they have installed the TWs. To avert this risk, the project has a
mechanism to closely monitor project implementation and identify causes for
delays and initiate appropriate remedial actions. The other risk is the
failure to ensure adequate and timely power availability. To minimize the
risk of power shortage, the proposed load management scheme would minimize
power demand during peak hours, when load shedding is common. Moreover, under
the current practices, electricity in rural areas is available 8-10 hours a
day, which is adequate for TW operation.
10.      Recommendation.  T am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.
