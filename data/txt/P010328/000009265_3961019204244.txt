IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
PRIVATE TUBEWELL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Cr. 2004-PAK)
Preface
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Private Tubewell
Development Project, for which Cr.2004-PAK in the amount of SDR26.3 million (US$34.4
million equivalent) was approved on April 11, 1989, and made effective on January 22, 1990.
There was no co-financing.
2.    The credit was closed on the original closing date of December 31, 1994. The credit
account was kept open for four months beyond the closing date to accommodate final
withdrawal applications. The last disbursement was made on May 9, 1995, raising the
disbursed total to SDR25.3 million (US$35.3 million). The undisbursed balance of SDR1.0
million was canceled as of this date.
3.    The ICR was prepared by a mission from the FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program,
which visited Pakistan in January/February 1995, and reviewed and revised by the Agriculture
and Natural Resources Operations Division, Country Department 1, South Asia Region.
Preparation of the ICR was initiated during the final supervision mission in October 1994, and
is based on material in the project files. The Borrower contributed by submitting a draft
evaluation report upon the ICR mission's arrival, providing other data required during the
mission's stay, and assisting in the preparation of the mission's Aide-Memoire.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
PRIVATE TUBEWELL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Cr. 2004-PAK)
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
1.         The project was processed and approved as a sequel to the commitment of the Government of
Pakistan (GOP) to promote private tubewell (PTW) development in fresh groundwater (FGW) areas.
Project Objectives
2.         The project was designed as a pilot scheme to test the viability of an integrated private
tubewell development with a view to increasing agricultural production in one of the least developed
regions in Punjab Province by providing reliable supplementary irrigation, controlling and preventing
waterlogging and salinity, and improving agricultural and water management practices. To achieve these
objectives, the project envisaged electrification of about 8,000 tubewells, 300 agro-industrial units, and 190
villages, and improvement of 320 watercourses. Technical assistance, training and equipment were also
provided.
3.         The project objectives were clear, sound and in line with the Government's sector policies and
the Bank's assistance strategy for Pakistan at the time.
4.          During the course of project implementation, mainly due to relatively higher increases in the
electric tariff as compared to diesel oil prices which the Bank did not correctly forecast, and the widespread
dissemination of an efficient new technology, most farmers opted for diesel tubewells (DTWs) rather than
electric tubewells (ETWs). Consequently, the project's physical target for tubewell electrification was
significantly reduced, and the number of villages to be electrified was increased instead, which made most
of the project expenditures spent for village electrification. The farmer preference for DTWs became
apparent after most of the investment in the electrification infrastructure had already been made.
Therefore, restructuring the project at that time was impossible and increasing the number of villages to be
electrified was the only way for utilizing the surplus electric supply capacity. However, the ERR for the
village electrification component (83% of project expenditures) is calculated to be below the opportunity
cost of capital, and hence our overall assessment of the project's outcome as unsatisfactory.
Implementation Experience and Results
5.         The sector objectives of controlling and preventing waterlogging and salinity through the
private sector, and the project's physical objectives of developing PTWs and improving water management
in the project area were largely achieved. It is, however, mainly because farmers installed more than 5000
DTWs during the implementation period without the project's physical intervention. As there are currently
no administrative restrictions on the number of tubewells or technology of pumping, considerable
disruption of the aquifer could occur if either the number of tubewells continues to increase, or positive-



- iv -
displacement pumps/turbines are introduced. Sustainability, therefore, requires Government regulation and
eventually construction of horizontal drainage systems. The project targets for watercourse improvements
were partly achieved (58 percent of the target), mainly due to a shortfall in counter-part funding, resulting
from an anomaly in the project PC-I.
6.          The adjustment in ETWs and village electrification targets was timely and effective. While
the electric infrastructure established under the project was not fully utilized until the Credit Closing Date,
WAPDA is electrifying further PTWs and villages, and it is expected that adequate capacity utilization
would be achieved during the next few years.
7.          The Bank's appraisal did not explicitly forecast the relative price movement for electricity and
diesel oil in both financial and economic terms. As the implicit assumption that there would be no relative
price change turned out to be wrong, with the result that demand for ETWs was only 6% of the forecast,
the Bank's performance during appraisal is judged to have been unsatisfactory. This project could also
have greatly benefited from closer farmer participation secured through the use of social organizers.
Procurement and disbursements proceeded exceptionally well and in accordance with the appraisal
estimates. As soon as it became clear that the demand for ETWs and electrical connections was far lower
than anticipated at appraisal, the Bank took the initiative and reached agreement with WAPDA and
GOPunjab to adjust the project targets.
8.          The Borrower's performance was satisfactory.   However, the consulting firm  for the
preparation of the feasibility study relied on secondary sources and underestimated the number of already
existing PTWs in the project area. Unfortunately WAPDA could not detect this anomaly through
independent checks. Had the actual number of PTWs been knowvn at appraisal, much lower targets would
have been fixed for ETWs in the Layyah project area. WAPDA also could have recruited the project
implementation assistance consultants in far less time than it took (more than two years).
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
9.          By the Closing Date the original project targets for ETWs were only partially completed,
although the revised targets and the overall project objectives were substantially met.  The project
contributed to demonstrating that waterlogging in FGW areas can be controlled, or prevented from
developing, by encouraging the private sector to invest in PTWs although most of these PTWs were
installed without the project's physical intervention. The village electrification component benefited the
population of two least developed areas of Punjab. The installed electric network will continue to benefit
the project areas through electrification of additional villages, PTWs, and industry. However, the ERR for
village electrification component was below the opportunity cost of capital. The overall assessment of the
project is thus unsatisfactory.
10.        Future operation and sustainability of the power distribution network and improved
watercourses are assured.
11.        There are six lessons to be learned from this project: (i)reliable data is essential at the design
stage, which in most cases can only be arranged through detailed field surveys and preparation of
inventories rather than from secondary sources; (ii) realistic forecast of critical input prices including diesel
oil and electricity should be made during project preparation; (iii) there should be mechanisms at the project
level to continuously monitor and report changes in economic conditions surrounding projects; (iv)
irrigation  projects involving  farmer participation  should  have provision  for promoting  social



organization/community development; (v) future groundwater development projects should have a built in
component for developing a regulatory framework to ensure sustainability; and (vi) in Pakistan, the Bank
should ensure consistency of the PC-1 with the SAR and legal documents.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PAKISTAN
PRIVATE TUBEWELL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Cr. 2004-PAK)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.         Background.            Until the late 1970s, the Government of Pakistan (GOP)
followed a policy of addressing waterlogging problems in fresh as well as saline groundwater
areas through a series of salinity and reclamation projects (SCARPs). The SCARPs in fresh
groundwater (FGW) areas involved large scale government investment in tubewells " that
served the dual purpose of providing subsurface drainage as well as supplementary irrigation
supplies. Although the SCARPs in FGW areas were initially successful in meeting their
objectives, because of various factors (of technical, financial and managerial nature), their highly
subsidized operations soon became a major liability for the government. While the performance
of the SCARPs declined over time, their demonstrative effect coupled with the introduction of
low cost technology for tubewells, resulted in a boom of private tubewells 'in most parts of
Punjab, except some of the least developed areas, including D.G. Khan and Thal. The growth
of PTWs in the SCARP areas compensated for deterioration of the SCARP tubewells by helping
to maintain the groundwater table at appropriate depths, and serving as a supplementary source
of irrigation under the farmers' control. In view of these developments, in 1980, as part of its
National Agricultural Policy Statement, GOP announced a new strategy for groundwater that
envisaged transferring the responsibility for development of fresh groundwater areas to the
private sector. The Private Tubewell Development Project (PTDP) was an outcome of this new
strategy. It was the first government effort to facilitate the development of fresh groundwater
areas through intensive private tubewell (PTW) installation.
2.                 The primary objective of the project was to test the viability of integrated
private tubewell (PTWs) development with a view to increasing agricultural production in two
FGW areas located in one of the least developed regions of the Punjab Province by: (i)
providing reliable supplementary irrigation water to farmers; (ii) controlling and preventing
waterlogging and salinity; and (iii) improving agricultural and water management practices. One
sub-project area (with cultivable command area (cca) of 95,200 ha) lies in a FGW zone on the
west bank of the Indus river and receives non-perennial water supply from the D.G. Khan canal
system. When the feasibility study of the PTD project was carried out, the groundwater table
in the D.G. Khan area was shallow, with less than 4 feet depth "over 80 percent of the area.
The second sub-project area with a cca of 60,600 ha is located in a FGW zone on the left bank
of the Indus and receives perennial supply from the Thal canal system. When the project's
feasibility report was prepared, the groundwater table was 4 to 12 feet deep and it had a slightly
rising trend. It was envisaged that installation of PTWs would provide farmers' control over
I"         About 11,000 public tubewells were installed in FGW areas.
21         As of 1987, over 250,000 PTWs had been installed in the country, with the majority in Punjab.
3/         According to GOP's classification, areas with water table depths of less than 5 feet are termed as
waterlogged and in need of subsurface drainage.



supplementary irrigation water, and at the same time help drain waterlogged areas, thus
precluding the need for public sector investment in subsurface drainage in fresh groundwater
areas. The project objectives were to be achieved through a coordinated package of incentives,
comprising electrification, credit, agricultural support services for small farmers, and technical
assistance, which was designed to promote investment in PTWs.
3.                 The main project components were (i) development of new  fresh
groundwater areas through intensive PTWs installation; and (ii) introduction of improved water
management and cropping practices to increase cropping intensities and yields. The project
envisaged electrification of about 8,000 PTWs, 300 agro-industrial units, and 190 villages; and
improvement of 320 watercourses. It also included a pilot load management scheme to minimize
operation of electric tubewells (ETWs) during peak demand hours. The total project cost was
estimated at US$ 50.3 million, of which the electrification component accounted for 83.4
percent; on-farm water management (OFWM), and 15 small pilot pressurized (drip and bubbler)
irrigation schemes 11 percent; and technical assistance, and training 5.2 percent (see Part II,
Table 8A).
4.                 The Project objectives were clear, sound, and in line with the
Government's sector policies and the Bank's assistance strategy for Pakistan at the time.
5.                 Project implementation was routine for the main executing agencies,
WAPDA and the Directorate General of OFWM (DGOFWM) of Punjab's Department of
Agriculture. Hence implementation risks, as such, were minimal.
6.                 Based on the comparison of capital and operating costs of tubewells with
electric and diesel prime movers, and a detailed farmer survey, it was determined at appraisal
that farmers would find electric tubewells (ETWs) financially and operationally more attractive
as compared to diesel tubewells (DTWs) because of lower costs and ease of operation.
However, during the course of project implementation, mainly due to relatively higher increases
in the electric tariff as compared to diesel oil prices which the Bank did not correctly forecast,
and the widespread dissemination of an efficient new technology (diesel oil based "Peter"
engines), most farmers opted for DTWs rather than ETWs.
7.                 To address the emerging pattern of farmer preference for DTWs and to
make the best use of the installed electrical infrastructure, the project targets for electrification
of PTWs and agro-industrial units were decreased, and those for the number of villages to be
electrified were increased"; this made most of the project expenditures spent for village
electrification. The above mentioned factors and the consequent farmer preference for DTWs
became apparent after most of the investment in the electrification infrastructure had already
been made and most of the Credit amounts had been utilized. Therefore, restructuring the
project including cancellation of part of the Credit was impossible and increasing the number
of villages to be electrified was the only way for utilizing the surplus electric supply capacity.
However, the ERR for the village electrification component is calculated to be below the
The target for PTWs connections was reduced from 8,000 to 500, and for village electrification
increased from 190 to 340. Subsequently, however, WAPDA increased these targets to 750 ETWs
and 840 villages.

opportunity cost of capital mainly because the project area is relatively sparsely populated. The
ERR would have been much lower if the number of villages to be electrified had not been
increased.
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
8.                  The sector objectives of controlling and preventing waterlogging and
salinity through private sector intervention, and the project's physical objectives of developing
PTWs and improving water management in the project area were largely achieved. However,
it is mainly because farmers installed more than 5,000 DTWs during the project implementation
without the project's physical interventions. The total number of PTWs in the project area is
now approaching 15,000 and the sustainable aquifer capacity in the Layyah project area is almost
fully utilized. As a result of the operation of PTWs, the extent of waterlogged area has
decreased. Even though the PTWs growth in the project area cannot be attributed solely to the
project interventions, the project's outreach activities" contributed to encouraging investment
in PTWs.
9.                  The project targets for on-farm water management activities (watercourse
improvements) were partly achieved, mainly due to a shortfall in counter-part funding, resulting
from an anomaly in the project PC-12F(see para 18). Only 184 watercourses were improved
against the target of 3203'.
10.                The project benefited substantially more people than envisaged at appraisal
because of the larger number of villages electrified (840 instead of 190). The adjustment in
ETWs and village electrification targets was timely and effective.  While the electric
infrastructure established under the project was not fully utilized until the Credit Closing Date,
WAPDA is electrifying further PTWs and villages, and it is expected that adequate capacity
utilization would be achieved during the next few years.
11.                 Comparison of the economic rate of return (ERR) estimated at appraisal
and at implementation completion should be made keeping in view the revised project targets.
In the original project, the benefits were to accrue mainly from PTWs electrification while with
the changed project targets, the benefits are mainly from village electrification. At appraisal,
the ERR was estimated at 25 percent. This figure was arrived at by charging 60 percent of the
cost of the electrification component to ETWs and taking into account the benefits of ETWs
only. The balance 40 percent of the electrification cost was attributed to electrification of
villages and agro-industries but an ERR was not estimated for these components. The overall
ERR taking into account the full cost of electrification was estimated to be 22 percent4.
The project fielded multidisciplinary teams to promote installation of PTWs, and conversion of
DTWs to ETWs.
2/          PC-1 stands for Planning Commnission Proforma 1: A GOP document that authorizes project costs
and expenditures.
3/          The shortfalls in the targets were made up under an ADB assisted project which covered the same
project area.
4/          The details of the overall ERR estimate are not available.



- 4 -
12.                 The overall ERR at completion, taking into all costs and benefits" is
estimated at 10.4 percent. The ERR for the watercourse improvements and ETWs electrification
component is 21.3%, in which 10% of the total cost of electrification is attributed to ETWs (The
separate ERR for village electrification component would be 8.4% if we assume that 90% of the
total cost of electrification is attributed to village electrification)2'. For estimating economic
benefits of village electrification the methodology adopted in the power sector has been used.
The benefits of ETWs are based on actual data on cropping intensities, and yields collected
through a sample survey in the project areas.
13.                 The relatively low ERR is mainly due to the fact that: (i) the project area
is relatively sparsely populated; and (ii) the electrical network was originally designed primarily
for connecting PTWs rather than villages. Consequently the network is so far not fully utilized.
It must be noted that secondary benefits, such as improvements in productivity and the quality
of life of the rural population, have not been taken into account in the above estimates. Village
electrification may also reduce migration to urban areas, thus alleviate population pressures
there, and promote new economic activities in the project area.
14.                 Cost recovery  for the  watercourse  improvement component was
unsatisfactory. As of the Credit Closing Date, only 23 percent of the amounts due had been
recovered from the farmers. To improve cost recovery, the Government of Punjab assigned the
responsibility for collecting arrears to the Revenue Department. However, the desired results
could not be achieved, partly because the Department had to soften its stand when flood damages
in 1994 made it difficult for the majority of farmers to pay, and recovery operations had to be
suspended for one year.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
Factors Not Generally Subject to Government Control
15.                 As indicated in para 7, the original project targets for ETWs had to be
substantially reduced, as farmers opted for DTWs rather than ETWs. The farmers' preference
was a consequence of two main factors (i) relatively higher increase in the electric tariff
compared to prices of high speed diesel oil (the flat rate electric tariff increased by 120 percent
between 1989 and 1993, while diesel oil prices increased only by 60 percent during the same
period); and (ii) the wide spread availability of a locally made high speed diesel engine (the
"Peter" engine), which is efficient and economical, and which was not locally available to
farmers when the project was appraised. Both these factors made DTWs more attractive at low
operating factors3' that generally prevail in the project area.
The benefits of the 23 agro-industries that have been provided electrical connections have not been
taken into account.
21          The SAR allocated 60 percent of electrification costs to the 8,000 ETWs. The ICR mission assumed
that the balance 40 percent was evenly split between 190 villages and 300 agro-industrial units.
Since 750 ETWs and 23 agro-industrial units have actually been electrified, it is reasonable to
allocate 10 percent of the cost to ETWs and agro-industrial units for estimating impacts of ETW
installation.
31          ETWs are still more economical than DTWs for operating factors higher than 25 percent.



16.               The load management pilot could not be operationalized because of the
small number of ETWs in the project area. In a sense this pilot no longer remained relevant to
the project area.
17.               The Bank required that farmers should contribute 30 percent of the total
cost of pilot pressurized irrigation schemes that were to be introduced under the OFWM
component; this was in line with the cost recovery provisions under the IDA assisted Third On
Farm Water Management Project (Cr. 2245-PAK). However, this resulted in the schemes not
being established, as farmers were unwilling to finance their share of the cost. While the pilot
schemes could have been implemented on a fully subsidized basis, it is doubtful whether the
result could have been replicated without continuing the heavy subsidy.
Factors Generally Subject to Govermnent Control
18.               At appraisal it was agreed that farmers would be charged only the cost of
low voltage electric connections from the distribution transformers. This was estimated to cost
about Rs 4,000 per ETW. Later, however, the Government decided to increase the charge to
Rs 19,500 ". This increase coupled with the increase in electric tariff made the ETWs less
attractive for farmers as compared to DTWs. While the OFWM component was carried out
satisfactorily, only 58 percent of the original target for watercourse improvement was achieved.
The main reasons for this shortfall were the lack of counterpart funds, and delays in appointing
field staff during the first two years of project implementation. There was an anomaly in the
PC-1, which somehow wrongly assumed that salaries of field teams were reimbursable from the
Credit. This resulted in exhaustion of counterpart funds before project completion. The
Directorate of On-Farm Water Management could have revised the PC-1 to address this issue.
Factors Generally Subject to Implementing Agency Control
19.               Unfortunately, WAPDA delayed the recruitment of the local consulting
firm that was to advise on project implementation and monitor and evaluate progress, for over
two years. Had the consulting firm been fielded on time the PTWs inventory and farmer
surveys for ETWs promotion would have been completed much earlier, and adjustments in the
project targets could have been made before the procurement of electrical equipment was
completed.
20.                The consulting firm that prepared the project feasibility report and a
Supplementary Study, highly underestimated the number of PTWs that already existed in the
project area. Had the actual number of PTWs been known at appraisal, much lower targets
would have been fixed at appraisal for ETWs in the Layyah project area. The performance of
the consulting firm which provided project implementation assistance was generally satisfactory.
However, it took longer than expected to update the PTWs inventory in the project area. Had
this inventory been completed expeditiously, adjustments in project targets could have been made
at an earlier stage. Furthermore, the location of the consultants' office at Lahore (about 4 to

per connection.

6 hours journey from the two project areas) was not conducive to close contacts between the
consultants and the beneficiary farmers".
D. Project Sustainability
21.                 Farmers in Punjab, including those in the project area, are well familiar
with tubewell technology. Workshop facilities and spare parts are generally available locally.
The PTWs are, therefore, likely to be sustainable from the operation and maintenance point of
view. However, some of the aquifers (e.g. in Layyah) have limited capacity, are fragile, and
prone to mining and intrusion of saline groundwater from adjacent or deeper aquifers. Although
the low tubewell operational use (about 6% in D.G.Khan and 3% in Layyah) would not
adversely affect sustainability, clustering of PTWs around villages and towns could place
sustainable operation in jeopardy. It could lead to over-drawing of the water resources, resulting
in salt water intrusion21.
22.                 The amount of salt now added in the project area (gross 180,000 ha) by
existing tubewells is about 100,000 tons/year, as compared to about 200,000 tons/year from
canal water. Like other areas that rely on groundwater use for irrigation, horizontal drainage
may eventually be required in the project area to remove the excess salt to keep the land fertile.
Moreover, as there are currently no administrative restrictions on the number of tubewells or
technology of pumping"1, considerable disruption of the aquifer could occur if either the
number of tubewells continues to increase, or positive-displacement pumps/turbines are
introduced.   Sustainability, therefore, requires Government regulation  and  eventually
construction of horizontal drainage systems. GOPunjab recognizes the need for introducing
groundwater regulation, and intends to develop a framework for introducing groundwater
regulation under the proposed Punjab Privatization of Groundwater Development Project,
recently appraised by IDA.
23.                 The villages electrification network, and watercourses improved under the
project should be sustainable. WAPDA will be responsible for the operation and maintenance
(O&M) of the net work, while farmers, who shared the cost of watercourse improvements, will
maintain the watercourses. In general, improved watercourses are well maintained in Pakistan.
E. Bank Performance
24.                 The Bank's performance during appraisal was unsatisfactory because it
incorrectly forecast demand for ETWs: by not correctly projecting the relative prices of
electricity and diesel oil, demand for ETWs was less than 6% of the forecast (500 rather than
8,000). The project concept was fully in line with the Government's and Bank's strategy of
addressing  waterlogging  problems in  fresh  groundwater areas through  private  sector
IDA supervision missions suggested to WAPDA to shift the consultants office to the field but
somehow this suggestion was not implemented.

which warrant concern.

interventions. Project preparation started in June 1983 under the UNDP-funded, Bank-executed
"Investment Project Preparation in Water, Agriculture and Energy Sectors (Pakistan Umbrella
Project)" and a Feasibility Report was completed in September 1985. The Feasibility Report
was reviewed jointly by the Government and Bank. The Bank proposed, and it was agreed, that
further field surveys should be carried out to study the utilization of existing PTWs and to
ascertain demand for ETWs in the project area. A Supplementary Study was completed in June
1987. During the Supplementary Study some 774 farmers (about 10 percent of the expected
number of farmers who were supposed to install ETWs under the project) were interviewed.
Over 98 percent of the respondents expressed a clear preference for ETWs over DTWs, mainly
because of lower O&M costs and ease of operation. Despite these surveys, however, the
appraisal mission's estimates of ETWs' demand proved to be optimistic. It didn't explicitly
make a forecast of the relative movement of the electric tariff and diesel oil prices both in
financial and economic terms; if it had been made, the project might not have encouraged ETW
connection. Furthermore, like many other older generation projects, this project could also have
greatly benefitted from closer farmer participation secured through the use of social
organizers". The inclusion of social scientist in the appraisal mission would also have been
beneficial in addressing farmer participation and community organization issues more effectively.
25.                 The Bank's performance during project implementation was satisfactory.
A project preparation facility (PPF) advance greatly helped project start-up. Procurement and
disbursements proceeded exceptionally well and in accordance with the appraisal estimates.
Although not envisaged in the original project design, supervision mission recognized the need
for outreach activities and introduced the multidisciplinary teams in the project to promote PTWs
installation. As soon as it became clear that the demand for ETWs and electrical connections
was far lower than anticipated at appraisal, the Bank took the initiative and reached agreement
with WAPDA and GOPunjab to adjust the project targets. More than 90% of IDA credit
amounts were disbursed at that time, which made the restructuring of the project impossible;
however, in hindsight, the project could have been restructured if the relative price movement
of electricity and diesel oil had been continuously monitored. All of the villages to be electrified
meet the selection criteria for village electrification applied in the power sector. Supervision
missions (see Part II, Table 13) were, in general, effective in facilitating achievement of the
project's revised targets. The last supervision mission initiated the preparation of the ICR and
Operational Plan.
If          Although the project used multidisciplinary teams to promote PTWs, the teams consisted of
primarily WAPDA, ADBP and Government employees who had no past experience of community
organization. While these teams succeeded in promoting individually owned PTWs they did not
have the expertise required for community/social organization. Consequently they did not advocate
the concept of ETWs jointly owned and operated by the community or farmer groups. Jointly
owned ETWs would have had higher utilization factors and would have been financially more
attractive as compared to individually owned DTWs.

F. Borrower Performance
26.                As the government cooperating agency for project preparation, WAPDA
supervised the consulting firm responsible for preparing the project feasibility report on a day-to-
day basis. In general, WAPDA's performance during project preparation was satisfactory. The
consulting firm, however, relied on secondary sources of data, and thus underestimated the
number of already existing PTWs in the project area". Unfortunately WAPDA could not
detect this anomaly through independent checks. Had the actual number of PTWs been known
at appraisal, muc'h lower targets would have been fixed for ETWs in the Layyah project area.
WAPDA's day to day management of project implementation was satisfactory. Its performance
in procurement of equipment was exceptionally good.  WAPDA's performance in the
construction of the electricity distribution network was also satisfactory. The low demand for
ETWs and electrical connections for agro-industrial units, was due to factors beyond its control.
However, WAPDA could have recruited the project implementation assistance consultants in far
less time than it took (more than two years). The delay was due to the long processing time at
WAPDA headquarters rather than at the project level.
27.                The DGOFWM's performance, including its ability to secure farmer
participation in watercourse improvement, was satisfactory. The watercourse improvement
targets, however, were only partly completed, due to shortfalls in counter-part funding (see
para. 18). The DGOFWM could have resolved this issue by revising the project PC-1. The
DGOFWM could also have played a more aggressive role in convincing farmers to participate
in the pilot pressurized irrigation schemes which could not be implemented mainly due to
farmers' reluctance to share the costs.
28.                Compliance with covenants was generally satisfactory, except for cost
recovery on watercourse improvement and delay in the recruitment of consultants.  The
Government of Punjab made the Revenue Department responsible for effecting recoveries.
However, the desired results could not be achieved, partly because farmers were granted a one-
year grace period due to the havoc played by floods in the project area in 1994.
G. Assessment of Outcome
29.                By the Credit Closing Date the original project targets for ETWs were only
partially completed, although the revised targets and the overall project objectives were
substantially met. The project contributed to demonstrating that waterlogging in FGW areas can
be controlled, or prevented from developing, by encouraging the private sector to invest in
PTWs although most of these PTWs were installed without the project's physical intervention.
The project also precluded the need for public sector investment in FGW areas and thereby
averted increasing the government's fiscal burden that would have been associated with the
operation and maintenance had a conventional SCARP type project been implemented instead.
The watercourse improvement component of the project also facilitated the introduction of
improved water management practices in the project area. The village electrification component
it         The supplementary report estimated that there were 2,600 PTWs in the project area while an
inventory prepared during project implementation placed this number at 7,300.



benefitted the population of two least developed areas of Punjab. The installed electric network
will continue to benefit the project areas through electrification of additional villages, PTWs,
and industry. However, the ERR for this component is below the opportunity cost of capital.
The overall assessment of the project is thus unsatisfactory.
H. Future Operations
30.                The responsibility for operation and maintenance of grid stations and
distribution lines rests with two WAPDA formations, the Grid System Operation and the
Distribution Operation Sections. The organizations have adequate staff and resources for
operation and maintenance.- The electrification infrastructure established under the project has
already been handed over to them. Spares parts are maintained by the Inventory Control
Department of WAPDA.
31.                The responsibility for carrying out further electrification works, such as
connection of additional villages and PTWs, rests with the Superintending Engineer (SE),
Distribution Operation, D.G. Khan.
32.                The ripple control equipment procured under the project would be installed
outside the project boundaries in the area served by the Farooq Abad Grid Station, under the
control of the SE Operation, Sheikhupura which has sufficient number of ETWs to allow testing
of the ripple control system.
33.                Farmers (grouped in Water User Associations) would maintain the
improved watercourses, while the Irrigation Department will continue to be responsible for
O&M of the canals feeding the watercourses.
34.                An Impact Evaluation study is being carried out by the Planning
Directorate of WAPDA. The performance indicators to be monitored include: (i) groundwater
abstractions in different parts of the project area; (ii) water table depth and quality; (iii) cropping
intensities and crop yields; and (iv) O&M of all electric network established under the project.
I. Key Lessons Learned
35.        There are six key lessons learned from this project:
(i)      reliable data is essential at the design stage, which in most cases can be
obtained only through detailed field surveys and preparation of inventories
rather than from secondary sources (see para. 20, 26);
(ii)      realistic forecasts of critical input prices including diesel oil and electricity
should be made during project preparation (see para. 24);
(iii)     there should be mechanisms at the project level to continuously monitor
and report changes in economic conditions surrounding projects (see para
25);



- 10 -
(iv)      irrigation projects involving farmer participation should have provision for
promoting social organization/community development, preferably through
the inputs of sociologists/anthropologists with the required expertise (para
24);
(v)       future groundwater development projects should have a built in component
for developing a regulatory framework (if it does not already exist) to
ensure sustainability (paras 22); and
(vi)      in Pakistan, the Bank should ensure consistency of the PC-1 with the SAR
and legal documents. A mechanism may have to be developed to ensure
consistency such as having it a condition for processing a loan (see paras.
18, 27).

electrical tubewells as originally conceived by the project.

6'    This is rated as unsatisfactory because the Bank did not correctly forecast the relative price movement
of diesel oil and electricity; it should be noted that their failure to correctly forecast the relative price
was partly due to the fact that almost all farmers interviewed in the project areas showed their
preference on ETWs. The Bank's performance for other points was satisfactory during appraisal.
2'    This is rated as unsatisfactory because the ERR for village electrification, which represented 83% of
the project expenditures, is below the opportunity cost of capital. It should however be noted that the
electricity supply infrastructure constructed under the project will continue benefitting additional villages
and TWs in the long-run.

' After the closing date, another 500 villages are to be connected through supplementary GOP funding (Rs 130 million).
This is to be achieved by the end of 1995.
Another 250 TWs were connected through GOP funds in the areas adjacent to the project areas
3' This was achieved with project funds and additional GOP funding of Rs 50 million.

4'  The project was brought about by a UNDP study carried out by Pakistani consultants under the auspices of the Bank.
There is evidence that Bank missions were undertaken during this period (see Table 12) but no mission details could

6' F = Financial problems: Lack of funds to complete the improvement of the original number of watercourses.
2'  T = Technical problem: It was anticipated that farmers would use electrical instead of diesel tubewells. The project
therefore had to be restructured since the electrical distribution system to be established by the project for this
particular purpose was essentially in place.
1'  Form 590 completed by the October 1994 supervision mission does not have 'Overall Status' but 'Implementation
Progress' instead. This was rated as highly satisfactory (HS) for the following reasons: (i) the electrical distribution
network to be established by the project was indeed fully established; and (ii) the number of renovated watercourses
was less than originally planned, but this was partly due to shortage of funds caused by a misunderstanding prior
to implementation.
2'  The rating is based on the number of private tubewells established in the project area (15,000 against 8,000
projected) at the end of the implementation period. However, the intent of the project was to install electrically-
operated tubewells, which the project attempted to promote by establishing an electrical distribution network costing
about US$42 million, or 84% of total project cost. Only 500 such tubewells were connected, the remainder were
all diesel-operated tubewells.



Appendix 1
ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT
1.        The economic rate of return (ERR) of the project is estimated to be 10.4% including
additional 500 village electrification to be completed by GOP. The reason for this relatively low
ERR is the low use (electricity consumption) made of the high-cost project investment
(distribution network). The ERRs for ETW connection and OFWM are estimated to be 21.3 %
and 21.0% respectively.
2.         Specific reasons for the poor economic result for the village electrification
component are: (i) the project area is relatively sparsely populated and villages are mostly small,
reducing the scope for least cost connections to the distribution network which was constructed
for a different purpose; and (ii) the project was designed as a private tubewell development
rather than a village electrification project; and . However, in the circumstances there was no
choice but to utilize the distribution system for village electrification.
3.        It must be borne in mind that the above assessment is based on measurable benefits
only. Non-measurable benefits, such as improvements in productivity and the quality of life of
the rural population have not been taken into account. These improvements may slow migration
to urban areas, alleviating pressures there, and help start new economic activities in the project
area.

The long-run marginal cost of electricity of Rs 1.977 per kWh (see Report No. 11286-PAK, Power
Sector Development Project, June 3, 1994) represents the economic cost of electricity supply. The
figure was adjusted by 20% since the distribution element is already included in the project investment
cost.

Economic Benefits From Electric Supply for Rural Households
Main benefits are: (1) Resource Cost Savings; and (2) Consumers' Surplus. The
Resource Cost Savings are the benefits for new residential users derived from the
substitution of existing methods of lighting (kerosene lanterns) by electric lighting. The
Consumers' Surplus is derived from the additional quantity of electricity above the
substituted level caused by the large drop in the price of energy that comes with a switch
from non-electrical method of lighting to electric forms. More specifically, the benefits
are calculated as the difference of the areas ABCDO and P3*Q2 (see graph).

1/ 10% of electrification investment cost. Converted from current to constant FY94 Rupees. Adjusted by SCF.
2/ Rs 24000 for each TWs; connection costs from main lines are included in the project cost.
3/ The long-run marginal cost of Rs. 1.977 /kWh (see Report No. 11286-PAK, Power Sector Development Project,
June 3, 1994) represents the economic cost of electricity supply; the figure was adjusted by 20% since the
distribution element is included in the project cost (Rs. 1.582 /kWh). Economic cost for operating ETW is
2190hr/year* 11.2 kW*Rs 1.582/kWh.
4/ Benefits for new installation of ETWs are based on the sample survey carried out under the project. Basic
assumptions are:
(1) Cropping intensities increased from 105.4% to 160.3% in D.G. Khan, and from 115.2% to 146% in Layyah;
(2) Average capacity of ETWs is 1 cusec; (3) Average CCA per ETW is 20 ha; (4) Operation factor of each TW
is 25%. For conversion from existing diesel TWs to ETWs, benefits were assumed to be 50% of those for
new installation. This is because main benefits for conversion comes from the increase of operating factors
from diesel to electric TWs. Based on the information provided by WAPDA, the number of newly
installed ETWs is 700, and the number of converted ETWs from DTWs is 50.

1.    INTRODUCTION
Private Tubewell Development Project (PTDP) has been implemented jointly by GOP
and GOPb in parts of districts of D.G. Khan, Rajanpur and Layyah as a pilot
initiative to facilitate the development of fresh groundwater (FGW) areas through
intensive Private Tubewell (PTW) installation for reliable supplementary
irrigation, controlling water logging/salinity and improving agricultural/water
management practices, to boost the agricultural production. The areas covered in
D.G.Khan and Rajanpur are termed as D.G.Khan sub-project while in Layyah as Thal
sub-project. Under the PTDP electrical infra-structure has been erected for
connecting   tubewells,   villages   and  agro-based  industrial  units.   The
implementation of the Project was started in January,1990 and carried out by:
*     Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) through Project
Director SCARP Electrification Central Division Water; and
*     Directorate General of OFWM, through Project Director OFWM (PTDP);
in collaboration with other public agencies and Messrs NESPAK as the Consultants.
2.    PROJECT EVALUATION
2.1   OBJECTIVES
The primary objective of the project was to test the viability of integrated
private tubewell development with a view to increase agricultural production
through a coordinated package of incentives comprising electrification, credit
and support services in one of the least developed regions of Punjab Province
for:
-     providing reliable supplementary irrigation water to farmers;
-     controlling/preventing waterlogging;
-     improving agricultural/water management practices; and
-     raising the living standard of the people through village electrification
and connections to agro-industrial units.
2.2   PROJECT COMPONENTS
2.2.1 Electrification
Under the Project, WAPDA was required to construct/augment distribution network
facilities for extending electricity to about 8000 private tubewells, 190
villages and 300 agro-industrial units as under;
*     Six grid stations (4 in D.G.Khan sub-project and 2 in Thal sub-project);
*     About 3900 CKM of Distribution Lines Network;
*     Installation  of  Ripple  Control  Load  Management  system at  Fatehpur
(Layyah), and
*     Accommodation and allied services including a ware-house at Muzaffargarh.
2.2.2 On-Farm Water Management
Under the Project, the On-Farm Water Management Directorate Government of the
Punjab was responsible for:
1



- 36 -
-     improving 320 watercourses along with establishment of demonstration
centres;
-     installation of 15 pressurized irrigation schemes; and
-     training of 240 OFWM, Agricultural Officers/Field Assistants.
2.2.3 Technical Assistance
Provision of technical assistance for the preparation of design, construction
supervision and carrying out hydrogeological studies.
2.2.4 Establishment of multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs) for tubewell promotion
and out-reach activities.
2.2.5 Impact Evaluation Studies (By WAPDA).
2.3   DESIGN, IMPLEMENTATION AND OPERATION EXPERIENCE
For design, construction supervision and hydrogeological studies the services of
NESPAK-Consultants have been utilized. The Consultants also associated with the
multi-disciplinary teams (MDTs) established for tubewell promotion and out-reach
activities. By November, 1993 about 15000 private tubewells in the project area
had been installed against the targeted 8000 Nos. tubewells envisaged under the
project. However, most of these tubewells were diesel run due to low capital and
O&M cost as compared to the electricity run tubewells.
To compensate for the short fall in extending electricity to the Private
Tubewells the November, 1993 IDA (World Bank) Technical Mission agreed with the
Project Management Cell (PMC) to change the Project priorities through its re-
structuring for optimal utilization of the electrical infrastructure built under
the project. Hence, the original targets for electrification of Private
Tubewells, Villages and Agro-Industrial Units were revised as under on
concurrence by GOP and GOPb:
a)    Private Tubewells.              500  within  the  project  area   to  be
electrified  by   31.12.1994   under   the
project.
b)    Villages.                       340  within  the  project  area  to  be
electrified by 31.12.94 under the Project.
c)    Agro-Industrial Units.          25 to be electrified by 31.12.1994.
d)    Ripple control load             Shifting of ripple control load
management equipment           management system to some other
installed at Fatehpur          area in Punjab where adequate
(Layyah).                      No. of electricity run Tubewells
would be available to monitor
the equipment performance.
As for the works related to OFWM component the same were lagging behind the
schedule due to;
-     late start of the field works; and
-     non-availability of compatible local funds.
IDA (WB) Technical Mission (November, 1993) apprehended that the target of
improving 320 watercourses may not be achieved by June, 1994 (As per PC-1 of OFWM
Component). Accordingly, the target for watercourse improvement was reduced to
220 (subject to availability of local funds).

2.5   BORROWER PERFORMANCE
As per IDA's laid down schedule during the Project implementation period
(January,1990 to December,1994) WAPDA erected the electrical infrastructure as
originally envisaged under the PC-1 and extended the facility to tubewells,
villages and agro-industrial units as per revised targets. Achievements of
targets under the OFWM Component remained behind schedule as there were time
losses due to delay in release of counterpart local funds. Regular submission of
Audit Reports to the Bank was ensured as required under the Development Credit
Agreement.
2.6   BANK PERFORMANCE
Bank's participation, technical supervision and guidance, and financial control
for release of funds/reimbursement applications has been commendable.
2.7   KEY LESSONS LEARNED
i)    Gestation period in the implementation of the Project was too long. The
basic data for feasibility study was collected in 1985-86; and the
implementation started in 1990. During the above period a number of
parameters controlling economic costs of electric and diesel tubewells had
changed.
ii)   A certain time lag in planning and implementation cannot be avoided hence,
periodic re-assessment of the objectives and parameters controlling
demand, economic costs etc. should be carried out during implementation.
iii) With the introduction of increased electricity tariffs in April 1991, the
survey for assessing the number of farmers interested in obtaining
electric connection should have been carried out. This survey was
initiated in the end of 1992 and the results were available in 1993 by
which time most of the distribution net work had already been constructed.
iv)    Financial package of providing electric connection to the farmers @ Rs.
19,500 was not an alluring incentive as change over from Diesel to
electricity involved:
-     disposal of diesel engine;
-     payment of (cash) Rs. 19,500 for electric connection and security
deposit of Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 10,000.
-     purchase of electric motor;
-     bear higher operation cost; and
-     face the consequences of load-shedding. Farmers need groundwater
during peak demand periods in Kharif and/or during the closure of
canals in Rabi when the load shedding at the maximum.
v)    Availability of counterpart local funding should be assured at the time
of implementation. There was some ambiguity in the matching of local funds
in case of OFWM component. Such matters need to be cleared before starting
implementation.
vi)    In most of the countries where electricity load management system has been
introduced incentive in the shape of rebated tariff during off-peak load
hours has been provided. As such incorporation of load management devices
in the WAPDA Power system as envisaged under energy sector credit 2078-PAK
may not yield the desired results unless the provision for rebated tariff
is made.

3.    OPERATION PLAN
3.1   ELECTRIFICATION COMPONENT
In WAPDA set-up the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) of grid stations and that of
HT/LT lines rests with its two different formations namely Grid System Operation
and Distribution Operation, respectively.
As such 34 No 11 KV feeders constructed under the project have been handed over
for O&M to S.E distribution operation Power D.G. Khan and the newly
constructed/augmented/extended grid stations have been handed over for O&M to S.E
Grid System Operation Power, Multan.
Thus the electrification component are to be operated and maintained by other
formations of WAPDA who have requisite technical personnel and logistics. WAPDA
are already maintaining electricity network in the region. Hence, this project
will be a routine take over of reponsibilities.
3.2   OFWM COMPONENT
Under OFWM component 184 watercourses have been improved with one demonstration
centre at each site. O&M of watercourse does not involve any special
technology/funds other than periodic clearance which will be arranged by WUAs
(Water User's Association)/farmers.
Watercourses will be maintained by the farmers and will not involve any special
financing. Irrigation Department will be responsible for O&M of canals.
Agriculture Extension and ADBP (Agriculture Development Bank of Pakistan) will
be operative in the area to help the farmers on technical/financial matters.
4.    GENERAL
4.1    HYDROGEOLOGY OF THE PROJECT AREA
At the time of the feasibility study, the Project area, particularly D.G. Khan
sub-project, was assumed to be threatened with water logged condition due to
imbalance in:
-     net groundwater recharge through precipitation and irrigation system; and
-     groundwater discharge through pumpage.
During implementation of PTDP these components are more or less in conformity
with each other. Figures for recharge and discharge are as below:
Sub-project                           Recharge                           Discharge
AF/Yr.                               AF/Yr.

After   (1994)                        331,490                              319,516

After   (1994)                        181,535                              192,746

This balance in groundwater recharge and discharge will help to maintain water
table at a desired depth, i.e. below the root zone of crops. However, it will
accelerate the salinity accumulation in the Project area.
4.2   LOWERING OF WATER TABLE
Pumping through more than about 15,500 tubewells has helped in lowering the water
table in larger part of PTDP-particularly D.G. Khan sub-project which had about
75% of the area with less than 5 feet depth to water before the project
implementation.
Distribution of various depth to water table zone (as percentage of GCA) under
'before' and 'after' PTDP for the month of October (depicting the worst scenario)
are as below:
D. G. KHAN SUB-PROJECT
Year                         Depth to Water Table (feet)
0-3                  3-5                > 5
1986                57.5%                 25.1%              174.4%
1994                20.8%                 33.5%               45.7%
THAL SUB-PROJECT
Year                         Depth to Water Table (feet)
0-5        1        5-10                 > 10
1986                 Nil         |        52.8                47.2%
1994                 Nil                  65.5                34.5%
4.3   IMPACT EVALUATION STUDY
Impact Evaluation study is being carried out by Planning Directorate (Water)
WAPDA to collect detailed information on existing yields and determination of ERR
(Economic Rate of Return) under the present conditions and O&M of augmented power
capacity.
The performance indicators will be:
*     Groundwater abstractions in different parts of the Project area;
*     Water level and chemical quality of groundwater;
*     Cropping intensities and crop yields; and
*     Satisfactory operation and maintenance of electric hook-up established as
part of PTDP.

DRAFT IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PRIVATE TUBEWELL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
COMMENTS
It has been mentioned in the draft Implementation
Completion Report (ICP) of Private Tubewell Development Project
that targets for its watercourse improvement component were partly
achieved due to shortfalls in counter part funding. It has been
further stated that the Director General Agriculture (Water
Management) could have resolved this issue by revisina the project
PC_ T
It is pointed out that there was an ambiguity in project
PC-I and Development Credit Agreement (DCA) signed by the
government of Pakistan and the World Bank regarding sharing of the
project costs between donor and the borrower. PC-I of the project
indicated 70:30 ratio of project financing by the donor and the
government of the Punjab. respectively. DCA of the project provided
that 00% of the civil works and non recurring expenditures were
reimbursable by the donors and no provision was made for IDA
contribution  towards  pay  and  allowances  and  recurring  costs.
Government of the Punjab had. accordingly, been providing 30%0 of
overall  PC-I  funding  which  left  very  little  amount  for  its
contribution  towards  civil  works.   As  a  result  of  lesser
availabilitv of  matching  funds  for  civil  works.  the  advances
provided by donors could not be fully utilized due to which targets
could  not be achieved  as per PC-I  schedule.  Full  funding  for
watercourse improved could only be provided by revising PC-I or DCA
i.e. modification of atleast of the two documents.
It is further pointed out that Private Tubewell
Development Project (PTDP) was an umbrella project of the WAPDA
(implementing agency!. It had a very small On Farm Water Management
component. involving onlv 12 percent of the total project costs.
PC-I of the entire project was required to be amended even for such
a minor component but this is a very lengthy process. A reference



-47-
was. however. made by Directorate General Agriculture (Water
Management) to the government for approaching the World Bank for
amending the Development Credit Agreement. The government did not
acceded to the proposal and decided to follow more pragmatic and
easy option of completing the remaining project watercourses
through another ongoing scheme adjacent to the area of PTDP. The
remaining 136 watercourses have accordingly been improved under ADB
assisted Second On Farm Water Management Project, D.C. Khan. As far
as implementa-ti-on of pilot pressurized irrigation schemes are
concerned. the same have also been implemented under Productivity
Enhancement Program (PEP) funded by the federal government during
1992-93.
As explained above. all the OFWM1 activities envisaged
under the PTDP have been carried out, though the pending targets
were achieved under different projects. The desired impact
envisaged  under  the  project  through  implementation  of  OFWM
activities can thus expected to be accrued as all targets assigned
to OFWM in the PTDP area have been accomplished.

RE:       PRIVATE TUBEWELL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (C
DRAFT IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Receipt of the Draft Implementation Completion Report
dated October 23,1995 is acknowledged with thanks.
After going through the report one reaches the inescapable
conclusion that it thoroughly covers all the aspects of the Project
leaving no room for making any suggestions/comments for its
improvement.We accordingly commend the efforts of the representatives
of the Bank in compiling the report.
Since M/s.NESPAK Consultants worked both for the
electrification as well as On-Farm Water Management components of
the Project we sought their comments on the report as well,who vide
their letter No.J-1443/63351 dated November 16,1995 (copy enclosed)
too have upheld the report as acceptable without any reservations.
The views of the Consultants as such both for the electrification
as well as On-Farm Water Management components are duly endorsed
by this office.
