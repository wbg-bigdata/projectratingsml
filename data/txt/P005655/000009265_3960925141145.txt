TE',HNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT
(Loan 2197-TUN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR for the Technical
Assistance Project to the Government of Tunisia for which Loan 2197-TUN in the
amount of US$5 million, was approved by the Board in September 1982. The loan
was closed on June 30, 1988, eighteen months behind schedule. It was fully
disbursed, the last disbursement occurring on December 30, 1988.
The PCR was prepared with substantial inputs from the Agriculture
Operations and Industry and Energy Operations Divisions of Country Department
II of the EMENA Region for Parts I and III. Parts I and III were sent to the
Borrower for comments but none was received. Despite the Bank's requests, the
Borrowar did not prepare Part II.
The preparation of this PCR's industrial and energy component was
started with a mission in November 1989. The preparation of the agriculture
component was started in early 1989. The PCR is based on the findings of
these two missions as well as the Steff Appraisal Report; the Loan, Guarantee,
and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank
and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectivel
The objective of the project was to assist the Tunisian
authorities in increasing the number of projects for the 6th Development Plan
(1982-86) and in improving their quality in the areas of agriculture,
industry/exports, and energy.
Implementation ExRerience
The agriculture component produced several useful studies
(paras. 8-11 and 21-23). They were behind schedule, but if the planning
department of the Ministry of Agriculture (DPSAE) had not shown the initiative
it did (para. 34), they might not have been produced at all because
responsibilities has not been clearly assigned to concerned agencies
(para. 3). The industry component was hampered by its dependence on two
agencies that were themselves being reorganized or absorbed into another
agency (paras. 5 and 11). The energy component was hampered by the shortage
of expertise available to them at the crucial moments in procuring complex
information technology and equipment (paras. 7 and 15-18). All the project
suffered from Tunisian government procurement procedures, which had to be
circumvented by various devices, such as implementing project components
through autonomous agencies (paras. 8, 15, 31 and 34).
Results
The agricultural component yielded useful results in the form of
studies that provided the basis for future Bank lending (paras. 22-23). The
industry/export coi.ponent's results were confined to some organizational
improvements, studies that led to the creation of two export enterprises, and
some training for young entrepreneurs (paras. 24-25). The energy component
led to improvements in the data systems of the oil company, ETAP, the electric
power company, STEG, and the meteorological institute, INM. It also resulted
in a pilot windmill program run by the INM and an energy assessment program
run by a specialized agency, AME (paras. 26-30).
Sustainability
The longer term outcome of the agricultur   '!omponent are seen in
the Bank loans that made use of it (para. 22). The inaustry/export component
does not appear to have had a signific-nt sustained effect, since the
organizational improvements it achieved have been limited (paras. 24-25). The
energy assessment program has already led to energy saving in several
industrial enterprises and appears to be well established.



- iii -
The STEG data systems have become or are becoming fully
operational (para. 27), but the INM and ETAP have been having difficulties
with their systems because of the lack of expertise in selecting them
(paras. 16 and 18). The windmill program has been equally affected by poor
supplier performances as well as problems of competition with the STEG
(paras. 18-20), though it provides the first tests of a potentia'.ly sizable
energy source (para. 30).
Findings and lessons learned
Although the basic idea of providing technical assistance to
improve the capacity for creating investment projects was attractive, the
execution through numerous agenicies under different authorities led to great
problems. It led to oddities such as the executf.on of studies by agencies
whose own funcrions were put in question by the pro;ect and to the lack of a
central project authority that could ,;.    sound choices of software and
suppliers. This dispersion of effort wab ..airrored in the Bank for which the
project cost in terms of staff time was high and continuity in supervision
difficult to maintain.

Proiect Identity
Project Name.            Technical Assistance Project
Loan Number:             Loan 2197-TUN
RVP Unit:                EMENA
Country:                 Tunisia
Sector:                  Agriculture, Energy and Industry
Background
1.          At the start of Tun'.sia's Sixth Development Plan (1982-86), the
portfolio of well prepared projects in agriculture and industry slated for the
Plan was insufficient to meet sectoral targets. This situation prompted the
Ministry of Planning and Finance (MoPF) to request technical assistance from
the Bank to help strengthen project preparation capabilities in Tunisia, to
increase the number and improve the quality of investment projects, and thus
help achieve Plan targets.
Prosect Oblectives and Descriotion
2.          Given the Government's objectives, the project included three
components: agriculture, industry and exports, and energy. The agriculture
component comprised the preparation of feasibility studies, national programs
and action plans and assistance with the start-up of an Agency for the
Promotion of Agricultural Investments (APIA). The industry and export
component included preparation of six priority subsectoral studies,
feasibility and export-marketing studies, review of the institutional
environment for export promotion, and establishment of an export expansion
system. In the area of energy, the project was to have made assessments of
renewable energy sources, energy conservation audits, plans for handling
petroleum products, geological surveys, and power system planning.
Design and Organization
3.          Under the agriculture component, providing MoA with the means to
conduct, a number of nationwide studies on key services and institutions was a
beneficial innovation. Until then the Ministry's capacity for studies was
geared to projects, rather than policy or institutional issues. In practice,
only two technical departments took leading roles for studies in their fields
(Farm Mechanization and Forestry), while APIA took full responsibility of the
Investment Support Component. Some technical departments showed almost no
involvement (the extension study). In some cases (marketing, irrigation
management), no technical department was identified for responsibility for the
study, too much emphasis was given to statistical and analytical aspects and
insufficient attention was given to policy issues.



4.          The industry and export component was carried out by two different
agencies, Centre National D'Etudes Industrielles (CNEI) and Centre de
Promotion des Exportations (CEPEX).
5.          One of the main criticisms of the design aspect of this component
involved the merger of CNEI and API as a result of one of the component's
studies. It is difficult to understand how a dissolved agency or even a newly
merged one would have been designated as the responsible agency to effectively
implement another series of studies which was the case with CNEI. Although
CNEI did perform several of the studies including one on electronics, there
was no coordination at all between the two studies done on the electronics
sector by CEPEX and CNEI which resulted in substantial overlapping of studies.
Such coordination should have been incorporated into the original design of
the project.
6.            te energy subcomponents of this project were executed by several
agencies: Entreprise Tunisienne d'Activites Petrolieres (ETAP), Institut
National de la Meteorologie (INM), Societe Tunisienne de l'Electricite et du
Gaz (STEG), and Agence de Maitrise de l'Energie (AME).
7.          In general, training needs and expert services were inconsistently
designed and greatly underestimated for this particular component. ETAP staff
could have benefitted very much from the provision of expert advice in writing
the specifications for their geological database, in overall training in the
use of the software and hardware and the input of the collected data into the
database in an adequate form. STEC and INM also needed more training than was
originally foreseen during the design stage owing tr, their inexperience in
writing bid specifications, preparing bid documents and using collected data
correctly in the context of databases acquired under the project. In the case
of STEG, the additional training resulted in a substantial underestimation of
the cost involved.
Implementation
8.          The studies in the agricultural sector were carried out with, on
the average, about one year delay. Delays were basically due to the
Government's complicated procedures for selection and recruitment of
consultants; reluctance of MoA or certain of its agencies to the execution of
studies, or to their execution by consultants; and the difficulty of obtaining
approval for the purchase of vehicles.
9.          Preparation of the N.W. Agricultural Prcduction Project and the
shallow well study were carried out by Government staff assisted by FAO/CP,
which at Government and Bank request was in charge of report preparation. For
the preparation of the forestry study, the Government signed a Fund-in-Trust
Agreement with FAO, which provided additional funding for the study through
its Technical Cooperation Program (TCP).
10.         The farm mechanization input distribution, irrigation management
and marketing studies were carried out by consulting firms, in all cases



except one (the input distribution study) consisting of an association of a
foreign and a local firm.
11.         The industry and export components experienced difficulties and
delays in implementation due to problems arising from the reorganization of
some of the key agencies involved in the project, such as CEPEX and CNEI,
lengthy implementation of studies, lack of follow up on such studies and
little institutional memory.
12.         Three studies regarding the country's export promotion program
were undertaken hy the chosen consultant. The first study (May 1985)
concluded that the effort for export promotion in Tunisia was spread among too
many different entities and was not well coordinated. To counter this
problem, the study recommended a merger between CEPEX and the export promotion
arm of the Office du Commerce de la Tunisie (OCT) and at the same time a full
reorganization of the resulting entity. This reorganization did occur in the
first half of 1987, however, the long implementation period of the studies
resulted in portions of the studies becoming irrelevant as a result of the
changes in the country's trade policies.
13.         CNEI also carried out several subsector studies, including those
completed for the electromechanical (1984), ceramic (March 1985), pickaging
(May 1985), electronic (December 1987), glassware (January 1985) and
automotive parts (September 1985) sectors. These studies led to several
positive developments including the identification of projects in the
electronics sectors and the integration and restructuring of production in the
glassware sector. Specifically, the three studies on the export prcmotion
program led to the identification of two projects involving the assembly of
electronic cards for computers and production of printed circuits. Both
projects have been implemented.
14.         Despite these accomplishments, no follow up was performed on the
subsectoral studies mentioned above and no one in API is responsible for such
follow up actions. None of the feasibility studies for the newly identified
projects from these studies has been undertaken nor was the study on
promotional activities for private industrial projects made. At this point,
one must acknowledge that, in all likelihood, the money spent on the studies
has been wasted because the studies have become outdated.
15.         The energy component experienced difficulties and delays in
implementation as well. Its situation developed from problems with
inexperience in system implementation, inexperience with the Bank's
procurement process, untimely authorization of purchases, contractor delays
and changes in location for installations.
16.         In regard to system implementation, ETAP experienced considerable
delays as a result of its inexperience in this field and because of problems
with the software. During the bidding phase of the project, the supplier
indicated that the database could be easily applied to the development of
ETAP's information system. However, in the actual implementation phase, this
database turned out to be too global to include important details.



17.         STEG also incurred a delay in purchasing its load measurement
equipment and accompanying software due to the lack of authorization coming
from the Comite National d'Information. Collection of data for the database
has been accomplished by sampling four groups of consumers for four months
each. This measuring program is now well underway.
18.         Lack of experience in the Bank's procurement process and problems
with the contractor caused delays in INM's portion of the energy component.
Implementation of this component took, in total, three years longer than
estimated.   il general, the performance of the contractor with this
particular subcomponent was below standard expectations. For example, ordered
spare parts are still undelivered. Moreover, the same contractor provided
some instruments without a manual and has acknowledged that it does not know
how to integrate these instruments into the whole system.
19.         Although fifteen windmills (under AhE s subcomponent) were
installed for irrigation purposes in the region of Cap Bon between July and
September 1986, eight of these mills are currently inoperative. This
situation developed because some of the farmers or whose land the pumps are
located have access to STEG's Electric grid and refuse to pay for maintenance
costs for the windmills. Due to the existence of subsidies, electricity is
cheaper for them than phying maintenance costs.
20.         AME also experienced some difficulties in the installation of wind
generator-s because of a change in location. The original choice for the
location of the generators, Sidi Oued Labid, had to be abandoned because STEG
extended their grid to this town after an Italian-Tunisian joint venture
decided to build a cheese factory there. A new location, Jabouza, had to be
chosen whi.ch caused an important delay.
Prolect Results and Sustainabilitv
21.         At the policy level, the a6riculture component of the project
provided the C.vernment with important recommendations for decision making in
resource man -ement (irrigation, forestry), support services (research,
extension, input distribution) and institutions (land tenure, marketing, farm
mechanization).
22.         The studies have also led to important investments aimed at better
resource use and improved support services. The Irrigation Management,
North;est Agricultural Production and Forestry Projects (Loans 2573-TUN,
2502-TUN and 2870-TUN) with a total loan amount of $57 million, are the direct
result of the studies made under the Project. The Research and Extension
Project, also resulting from studies made under the Technical Assistance
Project, was approved on June 5, 1990.
23.         Finally, several studies resulted in projects with an important
institution building aspect (irrigation management, forestry, research and
extension) and thereby are having a long term impact. The Project's support



to APIA also resulted in a greatly improved capacity of systematic
identification, appraisal and follow up of investments.
24.         One of the results of the industry and export component involved
the reorganization or merger of various institutions in the industry and
export sectors. In the case of CEPEX and OCT, this activity led to a somewhat
clearer definition of roles for the two agencies which had previously
overlapped in function. But the API, whose function had been to examine and
approve industrial investments, has not found a clear sanse of direction now
that the need for such approvals haE been largely removed.
25.         CEPEY is now contcentrating on export promotion for small and
medium sized industries, by arranging participation in trade fairs and helping
exporters meet specifications and quality required in the targeted export
country. It is also organizing in conjunction with API and other export
associations educational training for small industries and identifying
products which have the potential to be manufactured in Tunisia.
26.         ETAP implemented a pilot project for heating ten greenhouses.  The
results are very promising with an agroindustrial project a very possible
outcome of the study. It appears that a joint vent4re is possible with an
Itaiian and Tunisian company for participating in such a project.
27.         STEG's objectives in its subcomponent are generally meeting
expectations. The LODEN program is being fully utilized at this time, but the
SICRET program will not be fully operational until the necessary data is
collected from the newly installed measuring instruments.
28.         As for INM, the experience with the measuring equipment in the
fifteen operative stations is good. There are some difficulties with
processing the data in the GEOPAD database, because INM officers were never
trained to program this system with the particular sensors. that the contractor
installed. Regarding any further follow up activity, INM pointed out that
they are very interested in completing the original system as soon as the
contractor supplies the needed spare and missing parts. They would also like
to have additional training in using the GEOPAD system. As a next step,
further coverage of the country with more automated stations is necessary.
29.         All phases of AME's auditing subcomponent have been completed and
full reports have been issued. Five of the six audited enterprises ara
implementing the recommendations of these studies. One enterprisa, Socidte
industrielle d'acide phosphorique et d'engrais (SIAPE), will make the
recommendations part of a full site restructuring plan which will be started
shortly. The energy savings from this exercise will amount to 15,000 toe per
year.
30.         Under the windmill subcomponent, fifteen windmills have been
installed. Although some farmers (within STEG's electricity grid) are no
longer utilizing the installed windmi'lls, Tunisia, nevertheless, has a
potentially good market for these windmills since more than sixty percent of
Tunisian farmers cannot tap into Steg's grid.



Bank Performance
31.         Under the agriculture component, the speed of project preparation
and loan processing was an important factor for the success of the
agricultural component. The Bank showed considerable flexibility in enabling
the Government to carry out several of the studies with FAO/CP assistance, or
through arrarxgements with international organizations.
32.         The Bank's comments on draft reports of the various phases of the
studies weze not always made on time. In those cases, MOA was obliged to
provide the consultants with its comments within the time limits specified in
the contract before it had received the Bank's observations. Finally, a
larger degree of continuity of Bank staff responsible for supervision would
have been an asset in providing the Bank's support to project execution.
33.         The energy and industry components of Loan 2197-TUN were, in a
sense, two "casualties" of the Bank's reorganization. Implementation of this
project took place during the reorganization period with the result that the
people who had originally worked on these components had either transLarred to
other departments or had departed the Bank altogether. Consequently, these
two components lacked continuity in Bank supervision which was especially
critical given the complexity of the subcomponents involved. Regular and
consistent supervision by Bank staff in conjunction with experts would have
helped the implementing agencies identify and correct any difficulty which
arose thereby reducing delays and very likely costs. In general, the Bank
underestimated the effort and money necessary for successful implementation of
these components. During appraisal, the Bank also failed to consider the
impact of electricity subsidies on the choice of energy sources by users.
This is evident in the windmill example.
Borrower Performance
34.         Within the context of the agriculture component, the planning
department of the Ministry of Agriculture, the DPSAE, displayed considerable
leadership, butc due to various other tasks its staff sometimes could not
devote sufficient time Lo the studies.  With a few exceptions, the technical
departments were much iess involved than planned.  The role of the steering
committees was variable; in most cases they performed an important function in
the review of studv iecommendations and conolusions. A main cause for delays
in execution of the stuidies was the required submission of consultant contract
proposals to the procuremrent commission (commission de marches) for approval,
and consequently the need to follow public invitation for bid procedures
instead of the Bank's short list procedure.  The situation was improved when
the Bank agreed. on l(0% fitnanr.ing of the Foreign Exchange part of Consultants.
35.         The Borrower &,t)vely followed up on many of the main conclusions
of the studies in regard to reform and strengthening of support services
(research, extension) and improved resource management (irrigation, forestry).
The conclusions ot the agLicultural mechaiiization study were presented at a



seminar attended by MoA staff as well as representatives of farmers'
organizations, farm machinery traders and the local farm machinery industry.
The Government should have been encouraged to initiate a more concerted follow
up of the shallow well and marketing studies.
36.         If the Bank underestimated the effort and money necessary for
successful implementation of the industry and energy components, the Tunisians
overestimated their capabilities. ETAP, for example, was inexperienced in
implementing a geological database system. Because of this inexperience,
decisions which were needed for following up this project were postponed at
several levels. CNEI's segment of the project was totally lacking in
management direction. Although the Bank may have been at fault in designating
a reorganized enterprise to carry out subsector studies, it appears that
CNEI's and API's management of th studies was practically nonexistent.
37.         The Borrower in these two components also failed to contribute its
portion to the PCR. During the project completion mission, the borrower was
asked to provide a summary of its feedback on the project, but this was never
done.
General Conclusions and Recommendations
38.         The agricultural component was more successful than either the
industry/export or the energy components. Its main success was that most of
the studies contributed to the preparation of Bank loans, namely the
Agriculture Sector Adjustment Loan (ASAL), the Northwest Agricultural
Production Project, the Forestry Development Project, and, most recently, a
second ASAL and the Research and Extension Project. No Bank loans emanated
from the industry/export component, whose main benefits were the
organizational improvements affecting the CEPEX. Since the API has not yet
become effective in a new vocation after having lost its former authority, the
absorption of the CNEI does not appear to have achieved anything. Two export
enterprises were created, and some training for young entrepreneurs took
place. The energy component was followed by a small Bank loan, the Petroleum
Exploration Project, for $5.5 million, and it. yielded a useful geothermal
assessment that indicated several project possibilities. Moreover, the energy
assessment program has already led to considerable energy savings and is
expected to add regularly to them in the future.
39.         However, much of the project did not bear fruit or fell much
behind schedule. In agriculture the main causes of delay were due to the lack
of clear and workable allocations of responsibilities. The fact that the CNEA
played only a marginal role, when it was meant to be the main agent, would
have produce much worse results had the DPSAE not shown the leadership it did.
Procurement of consultants by ministries has been a continuous problem in
Tunisia, which has to be circumvented by devices like implementing project
components through autonomous age-^ies, which are not bound by the same rigid

40.         In the industry/export component the basic weakness seems to have
been that the studies were entrusted to agencies that were themselves being
put into question. The CEPEX survived and produced some results, but the CNEI
was, in effect, eliminated by being absorbed into the API and losing much of
its staff. The API, itself, appears not to have felt committed to the project
and the efforts of the CNEI were lost. The energy component suffered most
from the insufficient expertise provided to help the ETAP and INM, both
inexperienced, at a time when it was essential to ensuring that the equipment
and software that they were obtaining was adequate and would be adequately
serviced.
41.         Finally, the project was a victim of the Bank's reorganisation.
Since ir lacked a strong central component that ensured a commitment within
the Bank, it was virtually orphaned after the reorganisation. It resulted in
tangible benefits that seem to have outweighed its nominal cost, but the same
results could have been achieved cheaper under different circumstances.

Total                                       US$   1,320,000       526,840
The underspending for the different items is partly caused by the non-
performance of some studies (feasibility studies, promotional study for
industrial projects), partly by using cheaper sources of consultants (advisory
consultants), and partly by under-performance (training). It is not clear why
the institutional study is so much cheaper than foreseen. There is probably a
large differential between the terms of reference as estimated at appraisal
and the actual ones. The overspending on the equipment item was paid by
CNEI/API.
It should be noted that the money spent on the electronic subsector is
extremely high (US$217,670 for a private consultant study). API thought this
may have been caused by the consultant's travelling for which CNEI was
charged.
CEPEX
The board members who were interviewed about CEPEX's portion of the
project had no precise id3a about the cost of the study, and no statistical
data was available. The board members estimated the cost of CEPEX's portion
at US$ 400,000 which is exactly the originally estimated cost. They were not
sure how the various subcomponents were financed either. According to Bank
information, US$ 200,000 were to be financed from the loan 2197 and US$
200,000 from the Industrial and Trade Policy Loan.

Actual costs amount to approximately three times the original estimate.
Part of this is due to the fact that ETAP had to hire another consulting firm
to help them adapt the original database to handle the required seismic data.
This necessitated additional hardware, software and training which involved an
extra investment of US$ 411,000.          * - Information not available

STEG has paid the cost overrun from its own resources.

Although the actual costs are very close to the estimated costs at
appraisal, it must be noted that separate orders for spare parts are not
included here while required extra training will have to be financed
separately.
