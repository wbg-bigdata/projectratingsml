It is proposed to finance the ex-factory cost of cars for which CN is the suc-
cessful bidder. This means that up to about US$21 million of the loan could
finance local currency expenditures, depending upon the outcome of the com-
petltive bidding.
v.        Procurement of another 1,400 freight cars is proposed to be reserved
to CN in line with minimum utilization of its existing capacity. It was agreed
during negotiations that the price for the reserved procurement of freight cars
would be (a) for cars to be delivered in 1973, equal to CN 1972 prices plus
inflationary cost increases not higher than 5% and (b) for cars to be delivered
in 1974, not higher than 125% of the average of the 1973 prices as in (a) above,
and the lowest qualified bid under international competitive bidding.
vi.       The economic rate of return on the project is at least 17%.  The
main economic benefits will be derived from the decrease of railway operating
costs and the avoidance of costly diversion to road of freight traffic. The
financial benefits from the project will also be substantial, reducing a pres-
ent operating deficit of over US$108 million a year to about US$3 million in
1976. The financial projections assume substantial rate increases in 1974
and 1976 to compensate for rising labor and social security costs and pro-
gressive elimination of the deficit on passenger train operation. Freight
rate increases amounting to some Ps 250 million a year are now needed to
conform to the principle, agreed by Government and N de M, that all rates
should cover long-run variable cost and make some contribution to fixed cost.
Because of a slowdown of economic growth, however, Government is unwilling
to increase rates prior to 1974 but will pay to the railway, in the form of
identifiable user subsidies, the difference between existing and proposed rates.
During negotiations, Government and N de M agreed to raise rates in 1974 and
1976 and, in the course of this and the next four years, to progressively
eliminate the passenger deficit.
vii.      In addition to the operating losses of the railways, the Government
must also meet the cost of debt service on railway borrowings and that pro-
portion of railway investment which is not financed by further borrowing. To-
tal Government support of all its railways has increased by more than 14% an-
nually since 1964 and reached about US$200 million in 1971. By implementing
the Plan of Action, the trend should be reversed. Government support of N de
M is forecast at US$45 million in 1976 and total support of all railways should
be less than US$65 million. An important contribution to this improvement is
expected to result from borrowings for investment on repayment terms more close-
ly related to the economic life of the investment than the short- and medium-term
loans and suppliers' credits that have hitherto been traditional.
viii.     Although the upper level of N de M is capable, implementation of the
project will require assistance from consultants. N de M has concluded a satis-
factory two-year contract with consultants TOPS of Southern Pacific Railway
(USA). The Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) will also retain
consultants satisfactory to the Bank for strengthening transport sector plan-
ning procedures and carrying out a study on road user charges.
ix.       The project is submitted as being suitable for a Bank loan of US$75
million equivalent for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of five years.



MEXICO
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project to modernize and renew the plant and
equipment of the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico (N de M), to improve oper-
ations and to reduce the financial deficits of the railway. N de M is state-
owned and is by far the largest railway in Mexico, operating 70% of the route-
km and carrying 80% of the total railway traffic of the country.
ii.       The proposed loan of US$75 million would be the second loan to Mexico
for railway purposes and the eighth in the transport sector.  Loan 103-ME in
1954 (US$61 million) was for rehabilitation and modernization of the Ferro-
carril del Pacifico; six highway loans totalling US$176.8 million were for
construction of highways, toll roads and bridges. Execution of all projects
has been generally satisfactory. In the case of the railway loan, however,
agreed financial targets were not achieved, mainly because of increasing la-
bor costs, not matched by tariff adjustments.
iii.      The N de M, which plays an important role in the movement of freight
traffic in Mexico, operates largely with new equipment and good track but suf-
fers an acute financial problem which poses a heavy and increasing burden on
tile Government budget. The losses are mainly the result of the railways per-
forming social and economic functions through the provision of unremunerative
passenger services and the carrying of minerals and agricultural products at
rates below long-run marginal cost. There is also waste of capital resources
due to rigid labor rules imposed by a strong labor union. The project is in-
tended to start a drive toward improved performance and financial viability
after the Government, accepting recommendations regarding the transport sector
made by the Bank, declared it national policy that the railways should be run
on a commercial basis. Implementation of the varicus measures ultimately to
achieve financial viability is not going to be an easy task. Increases in
rates and fares, pruning of passenger services and uneconomic lines, and
changes of work rules are likely to encounter strong resistance from the
groups to be affected. However, the Government and the management of the N
de M are determined to initiate action.
iv.       The project combines the Plan of Action, based on the Bank's rec-
ommendations on rail transport, with N de M's 1972-1973 Investment Plan. In-
vestment will mainly be for locomotives and rolling stock, components for lo-
cal construction of freight cars, track renewals, bridge strengthening, ter-
minal improvements, modernization of telecommunications and consulting serv-
ices for modernizing the railways and strengthening transport planning. The
total estimated cost of the project, including contingencies, is US$203 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$113 million. The proposed
loan of US$75 million will finance about two-thirds of the foreign exchange
cost. Included in the foreign exchange component of the project and in the
loan will be about 1,400 freight cars which will be offered to international
competitive bidding with the Mexican state-owned firm Constructora Nacional (CN)
participating in the biddings with the normal preference to local manufacturers.



MEXICO
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Mexico and the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico
(N de M) have asked the Bank for assistance in financing N de M's investments
during 1972 and 1973, estimated at Ps 2,536 million (US$202.8 million equiva-
lent).
1.02      This will be the second railway loan to Mexico.  The first loan
(103-ME) of US$61 million for the rehabilitation and modernization of the Ferro-
carril del Pacifico was made in 1954 and the works were completed success-
fully in the late fifties. Between 1960 and 1970, six Bank loans totalling
US$176.8 million were made for construction of highways, toll roads and
bridges; physical execution of all projects has been generally satisfactory.
In the case of the railway loan, however, agreed financial targets were not
achieved, mainly because labor costs increased faster than revenues. The fi-
nancial situation of all the Mexican railways deteriorated in the sixties de-
spite a continuous increase in traffic and large investments made for the re-
habilitation and modernization of the system. This was mainly the result of
Government policy of giving priority to social objectives and using railway
tariffs to subsidize passengers in general as well as important freight hauls.
The Bank made an in-depth review of the railways in 1964, updated in 1966 and
1969. The deficits of the railways were increasing but public policy remained
unchanged throughout the period.
1.03      Early in 1970, the Government of Mexico concluded that major efforts
must be made to effect improvements in the transport sector and that the advice
and assistance of the Bank should be sought. A mission of transport special-
ists from the Bank visited Mexico in April 1970 and, after extended discussions
with the Mexican Government, completed its report in May 1971 (hereinafter called
the 1971 Report). 1/ Its recommendations, encompassing all modes of transport,
were well received by the Government and are reproduced as Annex 1. In
April 1971, the Board of N de M, chaired by the President of Mexico, formally
adopted a statement of railway policy, along the lines suggested by the Bank.
According to this document, reproduced as Annex 2, the Mexican railways are to
be operated on business principles, and action has already been initiated, aim-
ing primarily at achieving financial stability. At the same time, a National
Ports Coordinating Commission has been established, responsible for policy for-
mulation, overall planning and coordination of public and private interests re-
lated to ports.
1.U4      During 1970 and 1971, consultants from Canadian National Railways,
with Mexican counterparts, studied the problems of N de M. The implementation
of the consultants' recommendations has already produced satisfactory results
and has prepared the way for detailed action plans, described in this report.

-2-
1.05      The Mexican railway system comprises five Government-owned railway
companies, of which N de M, with some 70% of the total route network, is by
far the most important. Coordinated investment plans through 1973 and action
plans through 1976 have been prepared for the five railways in consultatlon
with thie Bank and are briefly reviewed in this report. The detailed techni-
cal, economic and financial analysis of this report concentrates, however, on
N de M's Plan of Action for its operational and financial rehabilitation and
on its 1972-1973 Investment Plan, which forms the basis of the proposed proj-
ect. The Plan involves expenditure of about Ps 2,536 million (US$203 million
equivalent), toward which the proposed Bank loan would contribute US$75 mil-
lion.
1.06      This report is based on (a) N de M's 1972-1973 Investment Plan;
(b) the Report on the Transport Sector of Mexico; and (c) findings of the ap-
praisal mission of September 1971, consisting of Messrs. R. Loven (railway
engineer-consultant), L. Marco (economist) and F. Sander (financial analyst).
2. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
A.   Operations in the Transport Sector
2.01      The Mexican transport sector in its inception was designed primarily
to link by road and rail the major ports with the industrial and urban centers
of the interior; secondly, an intricate network of roads and railways was con-
structed within the central plateau to link Mexico City with the main surround-
ing centers; and, finally, road and rail connections were provided for foreign
trade with the USA through a dozen border points along the frontier. Most ma-
jor towns and cities also have commercial airports. As a result, Mexico has a
comprehensive and strongly competitive land transport infrastructure, with port
and airport facilities to complement the other modes (see Map). The efficient
operation and coordination of the transport sector, which will receive about
one-fifth of total public investments in the seventies, is important for a
curtailment of public deficits and for the achievement of the long-term econ-
omic goals. A detailed analysis of recent economic developments and prospects
is given in the 1971 Economic Report on Mexico. 1/
2.02      The road transport industry is very active.  In 1970, there were more
than half a million heavy trucks operating over 40,000 km of paved roads, with
a road carrying capacity estimated at about 100 billion ton-km/year. Trucks
have been providing efficient service and competing effectively for new traffic.
Statistics concerning the intermodal split of land freight traffic are lacking
but indications are that foreign trade tonnage is almost evenly shared by road
and rail and will continue to be so through 1976. Railway freight traffic dou-
bled over the last 15 years; the growth is expected to continue, but at a
slower rate than in the past. Keener competition is expected in the future as
more and bigger vehicles enter the road industry.
1/   IBRD, "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Mexico," 1971, CA-14.



2.03      Legally, although not always effectively, public roa.d transport iin
Mexico is regulated by a system of concessions, permits and officially pre-
scribed maximum trucking rates. The system, however, does not apply to cer-
*        tain trucks operating under constitutional injunctions against the Secreta-
ria de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT) granted by the Courts in suspension
of SCT's refusal to issue permits to the owners. These trucks stimulate keen
price competition as they are not regulated in any way.  Government is already
taking steps toward an abolition of the present regulations.
2.04      A comprehensive reorganization of the ports is under way.  The Gov-
ernment has established a Ports Coordinating Commission to improve port man-
agement and organization and, with the help of consultants, to prepare traf-
fic forecasts and develop a long range port development program. A first
port loan was approved by the Bank's Executive Directors on May 2, 1972.
B.   Role of the Railways
2.05      In the face of strong competition from the roads, the railways have
substantially contributed to economic growth by carrying an increasing volume
of goods at low, and in real terms, steadily decreasing cost. Railways have
a clear cost advantage over road transport for the carriage in bulk of the
products of the mining, agricultural, and heavy engineering industries and for
most other goods over medium and long distances. (Details are shown in Annex
3.) However, unsound pricing policies, fully discussed in Chapter 6, have
caused some distortion of freight traffic and created an artificial demand for
passenger services.
2.06      Main traffic flows follow the historical pattern mentioned in para-
graph 2.01. Grain imports arrive at the Pacific ports of Guaymas and Man-
zanillo to feed the Central Plateau urban centers; raw materials move from all
over the country to the industrial centers, Monterrey, San Luis Potosi, Guada-
lajara and Mexico City, where finished industrial products originate in turn
and are destined for export to USA through Mexicali, Ciudad Juarez, Piedras
Negras, Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros. Exports are also shipped from Sonora area
in the northwest through Guaymas (cotton), from Veracruz in the southeast (man-
ufacturing), and from Tampico in the east (petroleum). Due to the uneven qual-
ity of railway services and to the greater efficiency and flexibility of road
transport, the trend of inland transport of refined oil products has been away
from the railways to the roads. The railways and PEMEX, 1/ in compliance with
the transport policy of Government, are jointly exploring ways to improve
railway service and make better use of existing railway facilities.
2.07      The most important task in the seventies will be the strengthening
of the railways' competitive position through equipment modernization, oper-
ating improvements and increased emphasis on marketing. The most dynamic
sources of foreign trade and railway traffic will continue to be exports of
fruits and vegetables, fluorite and other minerals and manufactured goods,
and imports of machinery and parts for road vehicles. In the decades ahead,
Mexico will have to rely on efficient railways to export, mainly to USA, bulky
agricultural products from northwestern areas and the central plateau - and
1/   Petroleos Mexicanos.



later from southern regions - and to channel machinery imports into industrial
regions in Monterrey, Guadalajara, San Luis Potosi and the Mexico City area.
Many railway interconnections around Mexico City will have to be removed and
the unified railway network will have to concentrate on long hauls.
C.   Transport Coordination
2.08      Following the comprehensive survey undertaken by the transport mis-
sion and the subsequent recommendations of the 1971 Report, important steps
have been taken by the Mexican Government. A national transport policy is
being progressively implemented in railways and ports, aiming at achieving
the least economic cost for the country while obtaining financial viability
for the operating agencies.
2.09      Past experience brings out clearly that authority for transport in-
vestment and operations should be vested in the same agency, and the recommend-
ations of the 1971 Report on transport policy aim at merging the Secretariat
of Public Works (SOP) into SCT in the future. SOP still has authority to pro-
pose new investments to the Secretariat of the Presidency; these transport in-
vestments are not always supported by adequate economic justifications or al-
ways sufficiently coordinated with alternative modes. The objective of merging
SOP into SCT involves considerable administrative and political difficulties
and its achievement is not feasible during the project period. As a first
step in this direction, the Government has agreed in principle to strengthen
the sectoral Planning Directorate in SCT (a) to formulate and coordinate long-
range policy and (b) to introduce project evaluation procedures. The Planning
Directorate will appraise all investment proposals in the transport sector and
will channel them to the Secretariat of the Presidency with its recommendations.
Agreement was reached during negotiations (a) to employ consultants, accept-
able to the Bank, to help SCT to strengthen the sectoral Planning Directorate
and (b) to carry out a training program for staff of the sectoral Planning
Directorate. Both items will be financed out of the proceeds of the loan.
2.10      A comprehensive study of passenger traffic has been undertaken by SCT
to determine a coordinated and efficient long-term passenger transport strategy;
this study, to be completed before mid-1972, is expected to be the first source
of interagency coordination. During negotiations, agreement was reached with
the Government to submit the draft study to the Bank for review and comment
by June 1972 and to consult with the Bank on the implementation of the study.
2.11      The 1971 Report recommended a thorough examination of the present
road user charges by a joint Government committee. The Government agreed during
negotiations (a) to undertake a study on this subject, to be completed no later
than 1973, under terms of reference, and assisted by consultants, acceptable to
the Bank; and (b) to consult with the Bank on the implementation of the conclu-
sions of the study. Consultants for this study will be financed out of the
proceeds of the loan.
2.12      The Government's long-term objective is to have one single, autonomous,
Government-owned railway system in order to achieve the benefits of (a) unified
and standard train operations, (b) a common tariff and service approach, (c) sim-
plified and standardized maintenance of railway facilities, and (d) economies



- 5 -
of scale in management, administration and procurement. SCT has already pre-
pared a plan, whose objectives were agreed upon during negotiations, for
unified operation of, among other things, yards and standard trains, and
specialization of maintenance shops. The study of a common tariff is also
under way; it was agreed upon with the Government during negotiations that
the comnon railway tariff would be introduced by 1975.
3. THE RAILWAY SYSTEM
A.   Introduction
3.01      The eleven separate railways existing until 1964 were consolidated
in the late sixties to five Government railways, offering public service over
almost 20,000 km route-km as detailed below:

Total         18,780         1,007           19,787    100.0
Although SCT lines are part of the formal trunk system they are, to a large
extent, long branch lines to the main Nacionales and Pacifico systems (see
Map). Rolling stock and motive power are interchanged through five main
junctions.
3.02      Substantial developments took place on the Mexican railway system
during the 1960's. Wlile the length of the system increased only marginally
to 19,300 route-km, freight traffic increased at an average rate of 5% p.a.
to over 48 million tons in 1970. Passenger traffic increased more slowly at
1.4% p.a. Total revenues rose only about 6% in real terms over the decade
and reached about Ps 2.8 billion in 1970. Steam locomotives have been phased
out completely in favor of diesel operations. Rail has been renewed or up-
graded - over half the network now has heavy rail (100 lbs or more per yard).
Telecommunication systems have been improved, as have freight yards and major
stations. The total number of freight cars has increased only 11%, with most
of the increase being in specialized equipment (e.g. hopper cars, gondolas,



-6-
refrigerator cars, etc.). Finally, there was only a small increase in the
labor force from 70,000 to 72,800. To bring about these developments, large
investments were made; for example, in the second half of the period (1965-
1969), investments attributable to the railways themselves averaged Ps 760 mil-
lion (US$60 million) p.a. and those by the SOP on line extensions and major re-
alignments of existing main lines averaged Ps 177 million (US$14 million) p.a.
3.03      N de M and del Pacifico are autonomous Government agencies.  In thie
conduct of operations they are managed by the same General Manager, appointed
by the President of the Republic, with Boards of Directors representing var-
ious Secretariats, the Chamber of Commerce and the Syndicate of Railway
Workers. The other public railways are operated as a Directorate of SCT
and are run by General Managers, appointed by the Secretary of Communications
and Transport, who serves as Chairman of the Board of all Government railways.
Through the SCT, the Government controls safety and engineering standards and
the tariffs of all railways. Railway operating and capital investment budgets
have to be approved by the Secretariat of the Presidency. Although the pro-
grams of the N de M and Pacifico are made known to the SCT, they are, in
effect, direct submissions to the Secretariat of the Presidency whereas those
for the other railways have to go through a screening process by the SCT be-
fore final submission. The sectoral Planning Directorate in SCT (para 2.09)
will in the future coordinate all railways' investments plans.
B.   Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico
(i) Management, Organization and Staff
3.04      In October 1970, the new Mexican Government, which will remain in
office until end 1976, brought a new General Manager to N de M and, at the
same time, three new posts of Assistant General Manager were created:  one
for Operations and Engineering; one for Finance and the third for Planning.
In this manner, the number of staff reporting directly to the General Manager
was substantially reduced. The persons appointed to the four managerial posts,
although without previous railway experience, are men of considerable indus-
trial, commercial and managerial capacity. They appear to have good under-
standing of the problems of the railways and the actions needed to solve them.
3.05      Organization at the operational level, subdivided into 17 divisions,
needs a major overhaul. The divisions are highly departmentalized, each op-
erating virtually independently. Negotiations with the labor union will be
needed to change certain of the present operational practices as these are
agreed in the labor contract. Consultants will be retained under the project
to assist the railway - inter alia - in projecting future organization at the
field level (para 4.15).
3.06      Total staff has remained practically stable since 1966 and numbers
about 59,000. As a part of N de M's Plan of Action, and with the assistance
of consultants (terms of reference in Annex 4), a manpower plan is to be pre-
pared to show how many staff and what skills are needed in each part of the
railway and to set up related training programs. This is an important and



urgent task as there is little doubt that a considerable number of men are
redundant, although the productivity per man employed was 375,000 traffic
units (pass-km plus net ton-km) in 1970, which is similar to that of solne
European railways (Netherlands, 392,000; Switzerland, 333,000; France, 319 ,),000).
The expected traffic increase will absorb much of the redundancy. The Gov-
ernment has directed that the railway should not reduce staff because of the
present high unemployment, but Government and N de M have agreed not to in-
crease the labor force through 1976. This was confirmed during negotiations
and has been incorporated in the Plan of Action (Annex 7).
(ii) Railway Property
3.07      N de M operates approximately 13,900 route-km of single track rail-
way. A short stretch of the standard gauge line (103 km) is electrified.
Centralized traffic control has been installed over some 500 route-km of main
line. Control on the remainder of the system is by train order. The tele-
communication system is in process of modernization.
3.08      The motive power fleet consists of 821 diesel locomotives, 9 elec-
tric locomotives and 34 diesel railcars. All steam locomotives were phased
out in 1968. Of the diesel fleet, 151 locomotives are over 20 years old
(Annex 5). It is expected that 187 will be retired during the next three
years due to wrecks and obsolescence. Forty new locomotives have been
delivered in 1971, and 90 more are contemplated in the project (para 4.08).
3.09      There are approximately 1,600 passenger cars, of which 830 are more
than 30 years old and cause problems of maintenance and unsatisfactory serv-
ice. The freight car fleet of 22,200 (end 1970) is relatively new. Only
6,660 cars (30%) are between 25 and 30 years old and still have 5 to 10 years
of service life left. Most of the remainder are less than 15 years old
(Annex 5).
3.10      In general, track and equipment are maintained satisfactorily.
(iii) Operations
3.11      The most important operating statistics are presented in Annex 6.
Freight train loads have increased with dieselization from 812 net tons in
1966 to 931 tons in 1970, which is satisfactory for a country like Mexico
where grades are often severe and where there are many sections of light
traffic.
3.12      Utilization of motive power and rolling stock is poor.  Diesel loco-
motives are used in train service less than 10 hours a day rather than, say,
18 hours, because diesels are being worked in the same way as the former steam
locomotives. No records are kept of kilometrage of each individual locomotive
which prevents doing maintenance on a kilometrage basis, as it should be done.
At present, maintenance is on a time basis at low average kilometrage, result-
ing in the locomotives being in shops and running sheds too often. Overload-
ing of locomotives frequently leads to failures in service but the railway is



- 8 -
taking steps to improve the situation. There is no central control of loco-
motive and car utilization, resulting in unsatisfactory turnaround times and
contributing to locomotive and car shortages and empty car runs. Consultants
to be retained under the project will pay special attention, as part of the
Plan of Action, to locomotive usage and availability. Physical targets in
locomotive usage and availability have also been agreed upon during negotia-
tions (Annex 7).
3.13      In addition to its own cars, N de M operated on its lines, in 1970,
an average of about 1,400 cars of the other Mexican railways, 7,500 Mexican
private owners' cars, 4,200 foreign private owners' cars, and 7,500 foreign
railway cars (USA and Canada).  The average number of N de Hf cars on otlher
railways inside or outside the country was approximately 1,400.  By improving
car utilization, N de M will reduce by two-thirds its dependence on foreign
cars and its resulting rental payments.
(iv) Uneconomic Lines
3.14      The Plan of Action for N de M contemplates the removal, of sections
which prove to be uneconomic and for which alternative modes of transport exist
or could be provided more economically. The 1964 Bank Transport Sector mission
estimated that there were about 2,600 km of low traffic density branclh lines
for which there was doubtful economic or financial justification (Annex 8>.
Potential net avoidable losses in those branch lines are estimated at about
Ps 90 million p.a. (US$7.2 million equivalent), a large part stemming from
passenger services. During negotiations, the Government and N de Mi agreed,
as part of the Plan of Action, to make a feasibility study of low traffic
lines before end 1973 and, where it is not possible to establish suchl lines
on a profitable basis, to make appropriate recommendations to Government and
to take action to reduce the deficit (see outline Terms of Reference for the
study in Annex 8). The Government also agreed, during negotiations, not to
build any new railway line before the end of 1975 unless its economic and
financial feasibility has been established and agreed with the Bank.
(v) Accounts and Audit
3.15      The accounts of N de M are maintained and presented in a satisfac-
tory manner, and are audited by a well-known firm of public accountants,
Roberto Casas Alatriste.
(vi) Freight Traffic
3.16      N de M's freight traffic increased from about 14.4 billion ton-km
in 1965 to about 18 billion ton-km in 1970, mainly due to a substantial in-
crease in traffic of petroleum, steel and building products. By securing new
traffic of mineral and steel products, average hauls have also increased from
446 km in 1965 to 472 km in 1970. In conjunction with Bank staff, N de M has
made detailed freight traffic forecasts through 1976 by major commodity groups
(a summary is given in Annex 9). As a general principle, it has been assumed



- 9 -
that tariffs for both railway and road will be proportional to their respec-
tive operating costs and that the railways will secure traffic only where their
operating costs and resulting tariffs for any commodity are lower than the cor-
responding road operating costs and tariffs, after appropriate allowance for
differences in quality of service. Annex 3 gives a detailed test of the traf-
fic forecast. Substantial increases in rail traffic are expected in sugar
cane, grains, fruits, fluorite, petroleum products, building materials and
manufactured goods. An average annual growth of 3.3% is expected through 1976,
compared with 4.1% p.a. obtained since 1965, and a traffic of 23.6 billion ton-km
over an average haul of 498 km is expected by 1976. Based on consultants' re-
commendations (para 1.04), N de M is developing a new commercial strategy to
secure all traffic for which the railways are the lowest cost mode of transport.
(vii) Passenger Traffic
3.17      Passenger traffic, which grew by less than 2% p.a. between 1950
and 1965, grew by more than 2.8% p.a. between 1965 and 1970 as a result of
increased economic activity and a decrease of fares in real terms (para 6.04).
In 1970, N de 14 moved more than 33 million passengers, and the total traffic
was 3.4 billion pass-km, most of it second class; urban traffic is negligible.
The losses of this service, calculated in Annex 10 as the difference between
avoidable costs and actual revenues, are estimated at about Ps 285 million in
1971 (about US$23 million equivalent), or one-fourth of N de M's net operating
deficit in the same year. Targets for elimination of passenger deficits are
part of the Plan of Action (para. 4.03 and Annex 7). In accordance with this
Plan, N de M has already studied 20 passenger services and submitted the re-
sults to the Government; the methodology developed will apply to the whole
network. No dependable forecast of passenger traffic can be made because it
is not possible at this time to forecast in what measure the loss of passenger
train operation will be reduced by curtailing or abandoning services, increas-
ing fares and other charges, or subsidy of the users by Government. Neverthe-
less, an average rate of decrease of about 5% p.a. ,can reasonably be expected
through 1976.
4. THE PROJECT
A.   The Investment and Action Plans of the Mexican Railways
4.01      The five Mexican railways have prepared coordinated 1972-1973 In-
vestment Plans wlhich have been approved by the Government and included in
the Government's annual budgets.  The Plans are considered acceptable and
are summarized as follows:

Annex 11 contains a detail of the requirements, for all railways, of locomo-
tives, rolling stock and workshop plants. Since all railways are interconnect-
ed and rolling stock is frequently exchanged, reductions in investments by the
other railways might have a negative impact on N de M's performance and carry-
ing capacity.  During negotiations, the Government undertook to implement the
1972-1973 Investment Plans for all the railways.
4.02      With the help of SCT and N de M, all the railways are to prepare
Corporate Plans, similar to that of N de M, and coordinated investment plans
through 1976. During negotiations, the preparation and introduction of Cor-
porate Plans for all railways, under the coordination of SCT, no later than
D)ecember 31, 1973, was agreed by the Government.
B.   The Project
(i) The Plan of Act:Lon of N de M
4.03      As part of the project, N de M has prepared a Plan of Action for the
period 1972-1976. The Plan follows the recommendations of the 1971 Report and
the consultants' studies (paras. 1.03 And 1.04) and has been agreed with the
Bank; its main objectives are discussed in various sections of this report
and are listed in Annex 7. These are (a) to prepare before 1973 a comprehen-
sive Corporate Plan designed to achieve agreed quantitative targets through
1976 aiming at improving operations and greatly reducing operating deficits
by 1976; (b) to eliminate the deficit on passenger traffic by 1976; and (c)
to introduce a new freight tariff system.



- 11 -
(ii) The 1972-1973 Investment Plan of N de M
4.04      Based on expected traffic requirements, N de M has prepared a 1972-
*         1973 Investment Plan, which will supplement and support the Plan of Action in
order to continue improving N de M's operational performance and especially to
initiate a concentrated effort toward financial viability. Total investment
is estimated at Ps 2.5 billion (US$203 million equivalent) with a maximum for-
eign exchange component of US$112.8 million (paras. 4.17 and 4.23).
4.05      Cost estimates are based on mid 1971 prices.  N de M's budget is
expressed in monetary instead of physical terms and price increases in local
cost will be dealt with through carryovers into the 1974 budget. No price
or physical contingencies have been allowed for local costs. N de M will
procure most of the local materials for the project at an early stage; since
local prices have remained stable in recent years, neither significant over-
runs nor imbalance between local and foreign components are expected. Total
price contingencies of about 9% have been added on items to be financed by the
loan, and only 2% on items to be financed by bilateral lenders, the majority
of which is already committed. The main items of N de M's 1972-1973 Invest-
ment Plan are summarized in the table on page 12 and details are given in
Annex 12.
4.06      A brief description of the main items of the Investment Plan
follows.
(a) Rolling stock and motive power
4.07      Freiglht cars.  An amount of Ps 625 million (US$50.0 million) is
allocated in the project for acquisition of freight cars and Ps 21 million
(US$1.7 million), for roller bearings necessary for car rehabilitation, to-
gether representing 26% of total investment during the project period. Annex
13 shows the calculation of freight car requirements through the end of 1973.
Substantial improvements in carload and car availability are expected to cope
with needs created by new traffic. Since appraisal, N de M has informed the
Bank that, by implementing further operating improvements, it is believed that
the number of cars to be delivered in the two years 1972-1973 can be reduced
by about 10%.  The project has not been altered, however, since the reduced es-
timate may well be exceeded if the higher standards of utilization are not
achlieved or if traffic should grow faster than estimated.
4.08      Locomotives and spare parts.  During 1972-1973, N de It will purchase
or commit 90 locomotives and spare parts for a total amount of Ps 420 million
(US$33.6 million), representing 17% of total investment during the period. The
number of 90 (40 ordered for 1972 and 50 about to be ordered for delivery end
1973) has been based on (a) the need to replace 187 old locomotives and (b)
the expected traffic increase (Annex 14). Account has been taken of planned
reductions in passenger services and improvement of locomotive utilization
by changing existing work rules. Since N de M fears that the next renego-
tiation of the labor contract - necessary to change the relevant work rules -
would take a long time to conclude, N de M has agreed to review, assisted by

consultants and in consultation with the Bank, the appropriate timing for
the procurement of the 50 locomotives, before placing any contract.
4.09      N de Di's locomotive fleet is composed of about equal quantities of
only two makes, General Motors of USA (GM) and Alco of Canada. The locomo-
tives included in the project are to be procured from these two manufacturers
to maintain locomotive standardization.
4.10      Passenger cars.  N de M proposes to purchase 64 second hand pas-
senger cars in the USA or Canada and to rehabilitate them for service as first
class coaches. In addition, 64 mail and express cars are to be acquired, also
second hand. In general, investments in passenger cars would not be justified
in view of financial losses now incurred by railways in passenger traffic.
Nevertheless, by partially renewing the obsolete stock of first class coaches
(Annex 6), and by improving the first class service, all rates can be substan-
tially raised, and losses can be mitigated.
4.11      Workshop equipment.  In line with the general concept of modern-
izing the entire railroad, it is planned to rationalize the number of main-
tenance facilities for cars and locomotives and possibly reduce their number.
The shops to remain in service require upgrading to enable them to handle
increasing work loads as other shops are phased out. The project contemplates
tlhe acquisition of workshop machinery up to a total of Ps 72 million (US$5.8
million equivalent).
(b) Ways and Structures
4.12      A total of Ps 890 million (US$71.2 million equivalent) is included,
representing 34.2% of the total investment. Among the main items are:
(i)  690 km of new rails, amounting to 9.3% of total project
investment, to replace used rails in six high traffic
density sections; ballasting of certain sections (1% of
total investment) and easing of extreme gradients and
curvature on the main lines (1.2% of total investment);
(ii) four million timber sleepers, amounting to 8.7% of total
project investment, for normal replacements and to over-
take arrears in replacing sleepers in medium to low den-
sity sections of the railway and particularly in dry
areas of the country;
(iii) bridge renewal and strengthening, amounting to 7.2% of
total project investment, to cope with the heavier axle-
loads demanded by the operation of heavier locomotives
and cars; and
(iv) way maintenance machinery, welding equipment, track work-
shops, small tools and engineering equipment, amounting
to 2.7% of total project investment, to be used over the
whole network.



- 14 -
(c) Terminals
4.13      An investment amount of Ps 189 million (US$15.1 milllon equivalent),
or 7.4% of total investment, will help (a) to increase the efficiency of the
remaining workshops; (b) to introduce track revisions and extensions at the
terminals of Guadalajara, Monterrey, San Luis Potosi and Veracruz, whichl are
presently handling the highest car volumes; and (c) to carry out minimum in-
provements of freiglit sheds and stations.
(d) Telecommunications
4.14      Investment under this heading will amount to Ps 189 million (US$15
million equivalent) or 7.4% of total investments. The bulk of it will be in
line construction, installation of carriers, dispatch circuitry, highway cross-
ing protections, and train control, resulting in improved turnaround of rolling
stock and safety standards.
(e) Consultants
4.15      As a part of the project, N de M will be assisted by consultants
over the project period in the following fields: corporate planning, including
manpower planning; line and yard operations; locomotive and car control; lo-
comotive and car maintenance; telecommunications; costing, accounting prin-
ciples and financial forecasts and control. N de M has concluded a satisfac-
tory two-year contract, under terms of reference agreed with the Banlk (Annex
4), with consultants TOPS of Southern Pacific Railway (USA). The expected
foreign exchange component of US$0.7 million has been included in the loan.
4.16      Strengthiening intermodal coordination in the Mexican transport sec-
tor is one of the main objectives of the Government and the Bank. Also as
part of the project, consultants satisfactory to the Bank will be appointed
1by SCT for strengthening its Sectoral Planning Directorate, introducing trans-
port sector planning procedures and assisting the Govertment in carryin- out,
under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, a study on road user charges.
The expected foreign exchange component of US$0.5 million is included in the
loaui (paras. 2.09 and 2.11).
C.   The Proposed Loan
4.17      A loan of US$75 million is proposed to finance the foreign excliange
component of the project except for diesel locomotives and passenger and ex-
press cars which are to be financed on a bilateral basis. Some local currency
financing may be involved, depending on success of local industry in winning
bids for procurement of freight cars under international competitive bidding
(para 4.23). The possibility exists of a small retroactive financing of con-
sultant service for N de M if a contract for the provision of such service is
signed in May 1972. Loan items are described in Annex 15 and have been sum-
marized in the table on page 12.

D.   Execution, Procurement and Disbursement
4.18      N de M, assisted by consultants, is capable of carrying out the
project. All goods financed by the loan would be procured through interna-
tional competitive bidding.
4.19      The Mexican Government has requested that part of the freight cars
included in the project be supplied by the only domestic freight car manufac-
turer, the state-owned firm Constructora Nacional (CN), which operates effi-
ciently on a commercial basis, producing high-quality cars. The prices quoted
by CN are competitive and have, in recent years, attracted orders from rail-
ways in the USA, Panama and Colombia. N de M has already ordered about 1,000
freight cars from CN for delivery in 1972. All further tenders for freight
cars to be invited prior to the end of 1973 will be called simultaneously for
two groups of cars of similar types: 50% (Group A) to be acquired under
international competitive bidding in which CN would participate and 50%
(Group B) to be reserved for CN. The number of cars to be ordered under
this arrangement, covering N de M's needs up to the end of 1974, is estimated
at about 2,800. In the Group A bidding, CN should enjoy a margin of prefer-
ence of 15% on CIF prices, or the prevailing custom duty, whichever is lower.
4.20      In Group B, CN will supply freight cars at an average per unit price
not exceeding, in cars of comparable specifications: (a) for cars to be deliv-
ered in 1973, the 1972 CN average price plus inflationary cost increases of less
than 5% and (b) for cars to be delivered in 1974, 125% of the average of 1973
CN prices described in (a) and the price under the lowest qualified CIF bid of
cars in Group A. This procedure ensures a double objective: it puts a ceil-
ing on prices paid by N de M and it forestalls the possibility that CN could
charge unduly high prices for the cars in Group B to enable it to quote unduly
low prices for the cars in Group A. The number of freight cars reserved for
CN, together with other cars to be supplied by CN to the other Mexican rail-
ways, is sufficient to ensure minimum occupation of CN's existing capacity.
4.21      The landed cost of cars in Group A (ex-factory, if bids are won by
CN), has been included in the proposed loan, and it is recommended that the
Bank finance it whether the contracts are won by foreign firms or by CN. While
the Bank will not finance the cars to be ordered from CN in Group B, it is pro-
posed that the Bank should finance the cost of imported components for such cars.
These components, comprising mainly roller bearings, steel wheels and axles and
heavy underframe members, are to be procured under international bidding and on
a worldwide basis, in full conformity with Bank guidelines. The sum involved,
Ps 55 million (US$4.4 million) is included in the proposed loan.
4.22      There are four million timber sleepers in the project, of which two
million (50%) hard wood sleepers are included in the proposed loan and will be
procured through international competitive bidding. The other two million,
soft wood sleepers, not proposed for Bank financing, are reserved for the
large number of Mexican manufacturers whose productive capacity and competi-
tion the Covernment wishes to support.
4.23      The proposed loan would involve local financing up to a maximum of
US$21 million, depending on the outcome of the competitive bidding for freight
cars. This is considered reasonable in view of the fact that it assures in-
ternational competitive bidding for substantial items in N de M's investment
program which, so far, have been procured exclusively on the local market.



- 16 -
4.24      N de M is subject to import duties.  At the same time,Mexico is
a member of the Latin America Free Trade Association (ALALC) and has nego-
tiated preferences for the importation of lists of products originating in
member countries of ALALC. As of now,this will apply only to hardwood timber
sleepers and axles for freight cars. Should offers be submitted in inter-
national tenders from suppliers located in ALALC countries, N de M proposes
to evaluate bids on the basis of CIF landed price plus import duties.
4.25      Any savings in the loan account resulting from prices lower than
estimated would be used to finance similar project items in the ongoing pro-
gram subject to agreement with the Bank. Disbursements would be made on the
basis of CIF costs of US$67.4 million imported goods (or ex-factory costs,
excluding identifiable taxes, of locally procured goods), and of thie foreign
costs of consulting services (US$1.2 million). The balance of the loan funds
(US$6.4 million) is unallocated. Annex 16 shows estimated quarterly disburse-
ments assuming the proposed loan becomes effective in the third quarter of
1972.
E.   Financing Plan
4.26      Throughout the project period, N de M will be unable to provide from
earnings any finance for investment, which will consequently have to be found
entirely from borrowing and from Government resources, in the following manner:
Local    Foreign      Total       %
-TJUS$ million----------
IBRD loan                               -       75.0        75.0      37.0

Total      90.0    112.8        202.8      100.0
4.27      No difficulties are expected in securing finance at reasonable terms
for the 50 locomotives. For other items, short and medium-term loans will be
secured from traditional local sources. During negotiations, the Government
undertook to provide the balance of any funds required, now estimated at
about US$48 million equivalent.

5. ECONOMIIC EVALUATION
A.   General
5.01      The railways move about 40 million passengers and 48 million tons of
freight per year, and are an essential part of the Mexican economy. Freight
traffic on all railways, which has been increasing at 6% p.a. for the last
seven years, is now moving at costs substantially lower than those of road,
over hauls from 150 up to 2,000 km, averaging 458 km. As explained in Annex
3, it is economically sound to carry this traffic, which is paying for the
marginal cost of moving it in most cases and is expected to cover all long-
run marginal costs after the new tariff adjustments are introduced (para 6.03).
The benefits of the 1972-1973 Investment Plan and coordinated action for all
the railways are (a) the reductions of railway operating costs obtained by
increased workshop efficiency and better utilization of rolling stock and (b)
the savings in road operating costs and road construction obtained by avoiding
freight traffic diversion to road. A cost effectiveness analysis is given
in Annex 17.
B.   The 1972-1973 Project of N de M
(i) The Plan of Action
5.02      Independently from the capital investments, important savings are
to be obtained from the Plan of Action. First, the diversion to road of
passenger traffic by reduction of services and tariff increases will save
transport operating costs, including foreign exchange cost of locomotives,
and associated workshop investments, which will be released for freight traf-
fic. Second, the unification of railway operations will improve turnaround
time of rolling stock and utilization in workshops. Third, the Corporate
Plan, and especially the manpower plan, will reduce the need for capital in-
vestments. Finally, a new comercial approach will help N de M to capture new
traffic and, by improving service, to pass on to users the benefits of the
project.
(ii) The Investment Plan
5.03      The benefits attributable to the components of the Investment Plan
have been evaluated by assigning incremental benefits to successive increment-
al investments in four major groups. Sensitivity analyses have been carried
out, assuming (a) variations of unit operating costs and/or overruns in in-
vestment cost and (b) different levels of benefits arising from the four groups
of items. Possible labor savings have not been considered; the returns would
be higher with a reduction of N de M's staff.
(a) Ways and Structures
5.r04     The maiin benefits are (a) higher speeds, greater safety and improved
turnaround of rolling stock; (b) savings in materials resulting from mechan-
ized and improved trackc maintenance and from use of new rail; and (c) savings



- 18 -
in operating costs per traffic unit stemming from heavier train loads. Minor
savings are also to be obtained from lower inventory cost and easier maintenance
due to standardization of type of rail. The weighted internal economic return
(IER) of investments included under this heading is 14%.
(b) Telecommunications
5.05      The benefits of line construction, carriers and dispatclh circuitry
will be improvement of train selection and control, better turnaround of
motive power and cars and better service to users. First year benefits of
this investment are estimated at 20%, excluding benefits to be expected only
from improved operations according to the Plan of Action. Telecommunication
investments are expected to yield an IER higher than 20%.
(c) Freight Cars and Roller Bearings
5.06      For evaluating purposes, two-thirds of the investments in mainten-
ance shops and shop machinery have been included in this item (I'S$2.74 mil-
lion). Freight car requirements have been calculated through the end of 1973,
making allowance for the planned reduction of two-thirds in the number of
freight cars to be held and operated by N de M (para 3.13) and for withdrawal
of 900 cars due to wrecks, obsolescence and conversion to work equipment. Sub-
stantial improvements in carload turnaround time and car availability were
assumed as a result of the Plan of Action and investments in telecommunica-
tions and workshops. The benefits come mainly from avoiding traffic diversion
to road.  An IER of at least 21% is expected from this investment.
(d) Locomotives atid Spare Parts
5.07      For evaluating purposes, one-third of investments in maintenance
shops and shop machinery have been included in this item (US$1.37 million).
The benefits due to the new locomotives required to move the traffic forecast
tlhrough the end of 1973 take account of potential improvements in average net
freight train load, locomotive utilization, locomotive availability, and in-
vestment in telecommunications and workshops. Under these assumptions, sub-
stantial savings will accrue by reducing operating and maintenance costs of
the over-aged locomotives to be scrapped during the project period. It is
assumed that N de M will have a sufficient number of freight wagons during
the project period, either owned or rented.  A return, ranging between 14,
and 21%, has been obtained; the most probable IER is 17%.
C.   Conclusion
5.08      On the basis of the above estimation, the weighted IER of the four
major investment items, representing about 83% of the total project investments,
is at least 17.6%, which is satisfactory. The rest of the investments consist
of improvements to yards and consultants' services whichi are, necessary for
the project as a wqhole and whose benefits will spill over the whole project.
The overall IER of the combined Investment Plan and Plan of Action is at
least 17% (Annex 17). All returns calculated assume parallel implementation



- 19 -
of the Investment Plan and the Plan of Action. The whole project has a
sound rationale and deserves early implementation.
6. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Costs, Rates and Fares
6.01      The 1971 Report presented an in-depth study of railway costs and the
relationship between costs and revenues by individual service and commodity,
appended as Annex 10. A summary of the conclusions follows.
(i) Costs
6.02      There is excess employment in railway service but this is not a
major cause of the financial problem (para 3.06). While real wages have in-
creased substantially over the years, the rate of such increase has been ex-
ceeded by productivity. In real terms, unit costs have tended downward. In
1969, at current prices, freight long-run variable costs were equivalent to
UStO.6 per ton-km and, on a fully-allocated cost basis, to US41.04 per ton-km,
both of which may be considered reasonable. At present, the figures will be
only marginally higher, most of the price increases having been offset by im-
proved productivity.
(ii) Freight Rates
6.03      N de M's long-term objectives in setting freight rates are that:
(a) rates shall not fail to cover long-run variable cost and shall make some
contribution to fixed cost and overhead; (b) they shall not be set so high
that they divert to, or fail to attract from, competing modes of transport
any traffic which the railways can carry at lesser economic cost; and (c)
they shall not be set so high as to dampen demand. Average freight revenue
per net ton-km is presently equivalent to USJ0.8, which more than covers
long-run variable costs but falls below fully-allocated cost by a substan-
tial margin. Only a small number of freight rates (which, however, apply
to large tonnages of traffic) fall below long-run variable cost. The above-
mentioned objectives would require that revenue be increased by about Ps 250
million annually. Government accepts the principle that tariffs should be
adjusted in line with costs but is not prepared to contemplate a railway
tariff increase prior to 1974 because of a slowdown of economic growth and
the higher priority given to rate increases in power and petroleum sectors.
Instead, in 1972 and 1973, Government will pay the required sum into railway
revenue in the form of a user subsidy identifiable by commodity and user.
In 1974 and 1976, rates to the public will be increased to the extent neces-
sary to meet the pricing principle defined above and to partly compensate
for increasing costs. The amounts of the increases have been estimated at
about Ps 325 million in each of the years involved - a cumulative increase
of Ps 650 million in 1976.



- 20 -
(iii) Passenger Fares
6.04      Passenger fares were increased in 1970 for the first time since 1959.
The increases amounted to 30% for first-class and 20% for second-class travel.
The overall effect was to increase the average revenue per passenger-km from
the equivalent of USJ0.35 to USJ0.37. The increase in fares has apparently
discouraged short-distance travel, and thereby increased the average length
of journey. The level of passenger fares in Mexico is still extremely low -
the lowest in the world relative to per capita GNP and in absolute terms sec-
ond only to Brazil. Total passenger revenue at present fails by a substantial
margin to cover even the immediately avoidable cost of providing the service.
There is ample room for fare increases but, in view of the high elasticity of
demand for rail passenger service in Mexico, it is almost certain that where
alternative services exist, greater financial benefits to the railways will
accrue from elimination of trains and curtailment of services than from raising
fares. It is on this basis that management is approachling the problem. Tar-
gets for eliminating the passenger train deficits are outlined in the Plan of
Action which was agreed upon by the Government and N de WI during negotiations
(Annex 7).  A tentative assessment of the effects of implementing this action
is included in Annex 18.
B.   Past and Future Earnings
6.05      Annex 18 presents the income account of N de N for the years 1964-
1976, supported by statistics, financial data and explanatory notes. Provi-
sion is made for all foreseeable increases in costs of labor and material.
Wages, salaries and other staff costs are expected to continue their upward
trend, at current prices and in real terms. Government and the railways have
agreed that no increase in the labor force will be allowed through 1976 (para
3.06).
6.06      It is crucial to the attainment of financial viability that the large
losses from passenger travel should cease.  If the present situation is allowed
to persist, total revenue from existing passenger services will fall short of
the immediately "avoidable cost" of providing these services by at least Ps 400
million by 1976.
6.07      The financial projections assume that freight revenue will be in-
creased in 1972 by Ps 250 million a year through the medium of a Government
subsidy to railway users and by a further Ps 650 million in 1974 and 1976
through increases in rates to the public (para 6.03); that the railways will
be able to equate passenger train revenues to the avoidable passenger train
costs by 1976 (para 6.04); and that, in accordance with Government's railway
policy statement (Annex 2), the railways will be called upon to pay social
security costs no greater than those paid by private inldustry. Other assump-
tAons, which were confirmed and agreed upon during negotiations, are that:
(a) the tax of 12.2% of gross freight revenue, which has hitherto
been levied on rail transport but not on competing modes, will be
retained as revenue by the railways, with retroactive effect
to January 1, 1972 (Annex 18); and



- 21 -
(b) the railways, which in the past have been called upon to carry
mail for a token fee, will be paid for the cost of this ser-
vice, beginning not later than July 31, 1972 (Annex 7).
6.08      On the basis of expected traffic growth and the agreed actions,
freiglht revenue is forecast to increase from Ps 1,775 million in 1970 to
Ps 3,497 in 1976. N de M's average revenue per net ton-km in 1976 will be
14.8 centavos (USd1.18) as compared with 11.2 centavos (USiO.90) in 1964 and
11.0 centavos (USd0.88) in 1970, both the latter figures inclusive of Govern-
ment tax. At current prices, this represents an increase of 34.5% over 1970;
at constant prices, and on the assumptions of further price level changes
made in Annex 18, the average freight rate in 1976 would be only 2% higher
than in 1970.
6.09      Including user subsidies and compensation for social security costs
in excess of those borne by private industry, N de M's operating deficit of
Ps 38 million forecast for 1976 is in sharp contrast to the operating deficit
of Ps 1,357 million recorded in 1971. If user subsidies and compensation for
social security costs are excluded, the deficit will be reduced from Ps 1,357
to Ps 620 million. The improvement in the operating results may be summarized
as follows:
Inclusive of user subsidies and                  Exclusive of user subsidies
reimbursement of social                      and reimbursement of social
security costs                                  security costs

Th'  operating, ratios shown in the last column above were agreed during nego-
tiations to be the targets to be achieved by Government and N de M.  The
achiievemerlt of those targets will require, inter alia, increases in freight
rates, as shown in paragraph 6.03. Operating ratios exclusive of subsidies
were adonted as targets, rather than those inclusive thereof, because they
providp the ultimate test of Government and N de M performance in passing on
to the user the cost of providing railway service.
6.10      The improvement in the operating ratio is gradual, declining from
106 in 1971 and 143 in 1972 to 117 in 1976.  The Bank pressed during negotia-
tions for an early increase in those tariffs which are currently below mar-
ginLal costs, whichn would have made possible a more rapid improvement in the
operating ratio.  While the Government accepted the principle that tariffs
should be adjusted in line with costs, it was not prepared to contemplate a



- 22 -
tariff increase prior to 1974 because of the current slowdown of economic
growth. Under the circumstances, the operating ratio targets shown above
are the best that can be achieved through increases in operating efficiency,
curtailment of passenger services and other economy measures, combined with
some adjustments in tariffs beginning in 1974.
6.11       The achievement of financial viability, defined as the ability to
service debt and make a substantial contribution (say 40%) to investment in
a normal year, including timely renewal of all its assets, would in 1976 re-
quire N de M to earn net operating revenue of at least Ps 1,000 million a
year, equivalent to a return of 6% on the value of net fixed assets in serv-
ice; from a present deficit base of Ps 1,357 million, this is scarcely pos-
sible within the coming five years. In a second plan period of the same
duration, the objective might be attainable. Agreement was reached during
negotiations that the ultimate aim of N de M should be to achieve financial
viability and that the financial projections and associated actions will
be reviewed and adjusted periodically in agreement with the Bank according
to the progress made during the 1972-1976 period (Annex 7).
C.   Government Support
6.12       Government financial support of N de M has increased over thie past
six years at an average rate of about 14% p.a.:

/1   Including working capital requirements
The figures shown above for the N de M should be increased by about Ps 600 mil-
lion per year to cover support of the other four Government railways and the
railway investment expenditure incurred by SOP. In 1971, Government support
of all its railways is estimated at about Ps 2,600 million (US$208 million).
The effective implementation of the Plans of Action, applicable over the
entire railway sector, would result in a dramatic improvement in the finan-
cial situation, the relevant comparative figures for N de M being as follows:

In absolute terms, Government's support of N de M is expected to decrease
from its present level of about Ps 2,000 million (US$160 million) in 1971
to about Ps 563 million (US$45 million) in 1976, exclusive of any subsidy
to users of railway services which Government may decide to be necessary
(estimated at Ps 423 million in Annex 18) and reimbursement of excess social
security costs (estimated at Ps 159 million).
6.13      The cash flow of N de 1l, which is submitted as Annex 19 and sum-
marized below, indicates the extent to which Government has had to provide
funds in support of railway operations, debt service and investment.

A grace period of five years is recommended for the repayment of the proposed
Bank loan, to help to reduce the burden of N de M's debt service during a pe-
riod of continued financial difficulty.
D.   Balance Sheets
6.14      The balance sheets of N de M are reproduced in summary form in
Annex 20. Outstanding debt was reduced by Ps 322 million between 1964 and
1970. Borrowing traditionally took the form of short to medium-term loans



- 24 -
and suppliers' credits, the average repayment period being of the order of
six years. At the end of 1964, total outstanding debt amounted to Ps 2,478
million; in the ensuing six years, debt repayments totalled Ps 3,481 million;
new borrowing in the same period was Ps 3,159 million. As railway revenues
have been inadequate to meet even the costs of operation, interest charges and
debt repayment have been financed entirely by Government, as part of the Gov-
ernment subventions which have been treated as non-interest-bearing contribu-
tions to railway equity. The improvement in the debt-equity ratio from 20:80
in 1964 to 15:85 in 1970 has therefore been achieved at the expense of an ever-
increasing burden on the Government budget. Moreover, the trend followed by
capital investment in the past six years has not been commensurate with traf-
fic growth, the shortfall having been met by increased productivity. In the
six years from 1971 to 1976, capital investment is forecast at Ps 5,480 mil-
lion, compared with Ps 3,639 million in the previous six years. This higher
level of investment will result in a 27% increase in the net value of assets
in service during the period. As freight traffic is expected to grow by 31%,
a further improvement in productivity will be needed and may, with confidence,
be expected.
6.15      If such a higher level of investment were to be financed on the
same terms and conditions as in the past, the burden on Government would be
considerably greater than is shown in the projections. As will be seen from
the balance sheet for 1976, the projections assume that a substantial portion
of new borrowing will be either on Bank terms, or terms comparable thereto,
in the latter case particularly where purchases of locomotives are concerned.
The relief to Government provided by borrowing on repayment terms more close-
ly related to the economic life of the related equipment, rather than on tra-
ditional terms, is estimated at Ps 860 million (US$69 million) in the next
five years.
6.16      In 1976, N de M should be able to provide a debt service coverage
of about 0.3 from operations. The goal of financial viability will not have
been attained, but at least a base will have been established from which the
final assault can be made, provided that N de M's future borrowings are on
reasonable terms. During negotiations, agreement was obtained that N de M
would not incur any short- or medium-term debts, expressed as loans having
a maturity of less than five years, if after December 31, 1973, the total of
such debts outstanding at any time, including the debts to be incurred, would
exceed 10% of total capitalization, represented by total debt plus Government
capital contribution, subsidies and grants, less accumulated deficits on op-
eration.
7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) implementation of 1972-73 Investment Plans for all the rail-
ways (para 4.01);



- 25 -
(b)  preparation of Corporate Plans for all the railways (para
4.02);
(c) N de M's Plan of Action (para 4.03 and Annex 7);
(d) strengthening of, and provision of consultants for,
the sectoral Planning Directorate in SCT (para. 2.09);
(e) review by the Bank, and subsequent implementation, in con-
sultation with the Bank, of the study of passenger trans-
port in Mexico now being undertaken by SCT (para 2.10);
(f) completion of a study on road user charges no later than
1973, and consultation with the Bank on its implementation
(para 2.11);
(g) objectives and timing of the plan for unified operation
of all Government railways (para 2.12);
(h) date of introduction of a common tariff for all railways
(para 2.12);
(i) no new railway line construction to be undertaken prior to
December 31, 1975 unless its economic and financial feasi-
bility has been satisfactorily established and agreed with
the Bank (para 3.14);
(j) tax of 12.2% of gross freight revenue to be retained as
revenue by the railways (para 6.07(a));
(k) debt limitation covenant (para 6.16).
7.02      The project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$75 mil-
lion equivalent to the Nacional Financiera, with the Ferrocarriles Nacionales
de Mexico as joint-borrower. The loan should be extended over a period of
25 years, including a grace period of five years.

MEXICO
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Outline of Transport Policy and Recommended Plan of Action
Based on Transport Sector Report
No PTR-88 of May 1971 1/
A.   Introduction
The national transport network has made a very significant
contribution to the economic and social development of the country. The
Government and the private sector have in the past done all they could
to prevent transport from holding back development in any way)but funda-
mental deficiencies are now beginning to come to light and must be corrected.
The only way to solve the problems of an economic, social and other nature
now facing the transport sector is by adopting definite guidelines on trans-
port policy and this calls for important political decisions, administrative
changes, studies and other measures. The following problems can be given as
cases in point:
(1) Despite traffic growth, higher returns and higher levels
of productivity and efficiency, the financial situation of the railways
has been registering a rapid decline. They have a serious financial
deficit which now amounts to more than Ps 11 billion accumulated since
1959 and in the course of this year this figure is likely to go up by
Ps 2.5 billion, with an approximate annual increase of 12% to be expected
in future if the present trend continues. This would mean an additional
burden on the order of Ps 20 billion on the federal budget, between 1971
and 1976, without this money benefiting any specific economic and social
group.
(2) Highway improvement does not sufficiently reflect the
economic and social priorities of the nation, particularly as regards
pioneer roads. As far as motor transport is concerned,there are legislative
and administrative deficiencies (especially concerning freight), considerable
limitations on the power of the Executive Branch to introduce the necessary
measures and a lack of coordination between state, municipal and federal
transport networks. The absence of a single central authority responsible
for policy-making and planning has had the effect of causing over-investment
in trucking equipment, under-utilization of available capacity and operational
deficiencies.

Government but not yet adopted as an official statement.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
(3) The system of toll roads and bridges suffers from high con-
struction and maintenance costs and deficiencies in connection with tariffs
and expansion plans.
(4) The seaports are generally inefficiently operated, their
economic and financial viability is shaky and some investments are neither
well placed nor coordinated with other modes of transport.
(5) PEMEX's strategy toward investing in pipe lines, tankers
and port improvements is not closely coordinated with efforts being made
in other areas of the transport sector. Consequently it is possible that
some oil products are not being transported by the most economic means.
The present price policy and the tax system that applies to PEMEX probablv
amounts to a subsidy on diesel used by trucks and it is not clear to what
extent this affects the amount and application of the tax on gasoline con-
sumption; no studies have been made to prove the need or advisability of
this situation.
(6) With regard to air transport, the planning and construction
of infrastructure has been partially separated from its use and operation.
The financial position of the airline companies has improved during the
last few years but still remains in the balance as concerns the future.
Aeronaves de Mexico, S.A. in particular has excessive liabilities which
ought to be refinanced. The reason for this is that the company absorbed
the routes and debts of private companies that had gone out of business
after being set up without proper planning.
(7) As regards urban transport, greater effort is needed,
especially in Mexico City, in planning to overcome congestion, fight
pollution and meet the needs of a city whose population is expected to
reach the 20 million mark by the turn of the century.
(8) The proliferation of Government departments that have legal
or de facto authority in the establishment of general communications
systems and in the operation of the transport systems is a well-known fact.
Decentralized agencies are known to authorize, plan and construct general
communication lines that are not within their scope of authority.
(9) The autonomy of decentralized administrative service agencies
with independent management of their budgets makes it impossible, as things
now stand, to establish a general transport policy, and even if one were
established, it would be inoperative.
(10) There is no central planning and policy-making body in the
general transport sector to provide coordination with national planning, with
the result that decisions regarding investments, prices and operations in the
sector are made on the basis of partial programs which do not tie up with a



ANNEX 1
Page 3
comprehensive plan. In many cases investments are made on the basis of tech-
nical plans that satisfy partial specifications but lack the necessary pre-
investment studies, financial studies of recovery of and return on investment
and, generally speaking, without establishing the socioeconomic goals that
are sought. Furthermore, there is no scheduling to coordinate transport in-
vestments with those made in other sectors.
B.   General Objectives
In order to attain the general objectives of a transport policy
designed to overcome the problems mentioned above, account must be taken
of the rapid technological changes that are taking place in that sector
and the fact that transport operations are effected in a complex and highly
competitive ambience.
These general objectives can be outlined as follows:
(1) To create a transport system that makes the best possible
use of the human resources and capital available and which:
(a) Is integrated, efficient and safe;
(b) Considers the needs of all users at national,
regional and local level; and
(c) Meets the economic, political and social needs
of the country.
(2) To ensure that investments reflect national, economic and
social priorities.
(3) To ensure that tariffs or prices are such that they make it
possible to operate the system at least on an economically self-supporting
basis and for additional funds to be generated wherever possible so that
the operators will have funds available to plow back into their own invest-
ment programs, thus reducing the burden on the National Treasury.
(4) To do away with the practice of using transport as a means
of subsidizing Government and private users. When it is necessary to
promote the development and welfare of private groups, the provision of
subsidies must be clearly defined and paid by the Government to the in-
terested groups direct.
(5) To eliminate all discrimination between the different modes
of transport, resulting from regulations, tax systems or financial measures.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
C.   Administrative Structure
The formulation and application of the new transport policy along
the lines of the general objectives listed above and those referred to in
each subsector must be supported by an administrative structure capable
of providing unity of action, efficiency and continuity. Many years' ex-
perience, and the findings of the studies made, show the need for making
substantial changes in the present administrative structure. The reorgani-
zation proposed is based on criteria of efficiency that tie up with those
followed by the Government in its Administrative Reform of the Federal
Public Sector. Responsibility must be integrated both vertically and
horizontally.
(1) Vertical integration
This concerns general policy, planning, promotion, research, pre-
investment studies, preparation of projects and investment programs, con-
struction, upkeep and operation and liaison with state and municipal
authorities and also with the private sector. To achieve this integration,
it is proposed to merge the Secretariat of Public Works with the new admini-
strative structure of the transport sector. This merger is justified in
that the Secretariat in question deals almost exclusively with transport
works, as other public works are generally executed by the bodies responsible
for policy in each branch (irrigation dams are built by the Secretariat
of Water Resources, electrical works by the Federal Electricity Commission,
pipelines by Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) etc.). The proposed merger would
enable the new transport administrative structure to assume responsibility
for construction and, depending on individual cases, possible upkeep.
(2) Horizontal integration
This concerns all three transport systems: land, ocean and air.
To achieve this integration, the new administrative structure in the trans-
port sector would also be made responsible for ports and ocean transport. The
Secretariat of Communications and Transport would revert to the role it played
until 1940 and the Navy Department would continue to be responsible for the
other functions assigned to it. The new administrative structure, which could
continue to be called the Secretariat of Communications and Transport, would
be organized on the transport side as follows.
(a)  Under Secretary of Transport.
(b) Directors in Chief of Land Transport, Ocean Transport,
Air Transport and Planning, Pre-Investment Studies and
Research.
(c) Directors General, directly responsible to the Directors
in Chief in each branch. For example, the Directors
General of Road, Transport and Railroads would work
directly under the Director in Chief of Land Transport.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
The Directors in Chief in the transport sector would be responsible
to the Under Secretary of Transport. The Director in Chief of Planning and
Pre-lnvestment Studies, however, would be directly responsible to the
Secretary so that the matter of planning is directly linked with the admini-
strative system to ensure its unity and coherence, in kQeping with the new
policy directives. The administrative structure proposed has the added
advantage that the Chief Clerk and the Directors in Chief of Construction,
Tariffs, Information and Legal Affairs would serve both the transport sector
and the communications sector.
It would be advisable to set up a decentralized agency to take
charge of port administration and operation, similar to other agencies
already established, such as Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico (National
Railroads of Mexico), Caminos y Puentes Federales de Ingresos y Servicios
Conexos (Federal Toll Roads and Bridges and Related Services) and Aeropuertos
y Servicios Auxiliares (Airports and Auxiliary Services). Liaison between
the proposed Secretariat of Communications and Transport with decentralized
agencies in the transport sector will be organized to suit each situation
as it arises, but in all cases designations would be announced through the
Secretariat of Communications and Transport so as to guarantee the unity of
action required for effective implementation of the new transport policy.
The proposed administrative structure would enable the Secretariat
of Communications and Transport to submit through the proper channels current
expense budgets and draft investment programs for the transport sector as a
whole for the consideration of the President of the Republic. If experience
should advocate such a move, it would be possible at a later date to form
two Secretariats, one for Communications and the other for Transport, in
which case it would be necessary to establish in each a Chief Clerk's Office
and the departments that provide joint services, i.e., Departments of Tariffs,
Information, Legal Affairs and Construction, which would call for considerable
additional funds.
D.   Objectives of the Subsectors
(1) Railroads
In accordance with the general objectives mentioned above, the
basic policy decided upon concentrates on a determined effort to ensure that
the management of the railroads meets business standards. The Secretariat
of Communications and Transport will, accordingly, formulate fundamental
directives to be used as terms of reference and to assess performance. These
directives will include the following:



ANNEX 1
Page 6
(a) The preparation of a plan establishing quantitative
targets for traffic growth, operational efficiency,
employment, financial results, investments, etc. The
actual progress of the undertaking will be assessed on
the basis of these targets.
(b) The introduction of an effective cost-accounting system
in order to:
(i) provide bases on which to establish tariffs
that will reflect costs entailed at different
levels and in different types of demand; and
(ii) be able to assess the net economic return of
investment projects.
(c) The stepping up of marketing activities and market
research with regard to railroads.
(d) The study of passenger and local services with a view
to identifying those that are uneconomical and programming
their withdrawal wherever possible.
(a) The immediate increase of cargo and passenger tariffs on
a selective basis and the setting up of a permanent system
of reviewing tariffs to ensure that earnings for each
service cover at least the cost of that service so as to
break even.
(f) The preparation of a detailed employment plan, the minimum
aim of which should be not to increase the number of jobs
for the next six years at least. This plan will establish
reassignment and retraining programs for senior personnel
and specialized training both in Mexico and abroad. When-
ever necessary, use will be made of Mexican and foreign
consultants, who will be engaged for specific tasks for
limited periods of time and who will undertake to train
Mexican executives and personnel.
(g) The programming of the diversification of railroad activi-
ties to ensure that they provide an integrated transport
service.
(h) The setting up of an analysis unit to examine the economic
feasibility of projects for investment in railroad
infrastructure, works, equipment and material.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
The efficiency of the measures mentioned above will be reinforced
if the following measures are also taken:
(a) The speedy completion of the amalgamation of the railroad
systems.
(b) The elimination of the 12.2% tax on gross earnings with
respect to freight.
(c) The assisting of the railroads in obtaining foreign
loans on more favorable terms than those obtained
recently.
(d) The elimination of practices that are no longer justified
whereby the railroads provide various services to the
Government without covering their cost (for example, mail
carrying, reduction on passenger fares, etc.).
(e) The making of arrangements for the appropriate specialized
agency to attend to administration, provision of medical
services, payment of pensions and all the other social
security allowances rather than having the railroads pay
these costs directly.
If these measures are adopted and if the directives outlined are vigorously
followed, it is reasonable to expect that the operational deficit of the
railroads can be written off within the next six years. The financial
backing that has to be given them by the Federal Government (at the moment
Ps 2,500 million per year) could then be cut substantially.
(2) Highways and Road Transport
(a) Highways
Thanks to the volume of investments made in highways in
the past, the primary highway network is now reasonably complete. Efforts
should now be directed toward improving it to meet traffic demands. This will
require constant improvements in the collection and processing of traffic data,
in surveys and in project appraisal methods so that extensions or improvements
to the primary network are effected in accordance with adequate specifications
and in a rational order of priority. The emphasis of highway development
strategy should now shift to secondary and local roads. This is essential
in order to bring the large rural population into the economic life of the
country and in order to curb the trend toward urbanization as far as possible
by making it attractive to remain in the country. This will require certain
measures, including the following:



ANNEX 1
Page 8
(i) The decisions that there must be less centralization
and more participation of the States and local com-
munities, accompanied by improved highway planning,
design, construction and maintenance. The federal
authorities should play an active role in providing
advice to state councils and to local communities.
(ii) The introduction of directives designed to ensure
that the transport situation is viewed as an inter-
sectoral whole, which will make it possible to
ensure that potential benefits from investments in
highways are realized to the greatest possible extent
by means of coordinated action with other Secretariats;
this can be achieved by setting up a high-level
Intersecretariat Planning Committee, composed of
representatives of the Secretariats of Communications
and Transport, Agriculture, Water Resources, Public
Health and Welfare, Education, Finance and Public
Credit, the state Governors, the agricultural credit
institutions, etc.
(iii) The carrying out of a study to reclassify roads and
highways according to their economic and social
functions.
(iv) The making of a study aimed toward revising present
bipartite and tripartite financing systems to ensure
that there are sufficient funds available for the
development of secondary and local roads.
(b) Road Transport
There is some evidence that the present system of route con-
cessions and of rate fixing is not only ineffective but might also have con-
tributed to a certain extent to the excess capacity and under-utilization of
truck fleets and to operational defects. A thorough survey is called for to
assess the economic and social cost of the present system and to outline the
bases for a new policy for road transport regulations to foster its develop-
ment on a nmore rational basis.
It appears that diesel road transport does not contribute
sufficiently to the cost of the highways. It is also probable that diesel
road transport is subsidized. Therefore an investigation is called for with
a view to establishing the bases for an efficient policy as regards payment
for the use of highways which will foster competition between road and rail
transport on a sound basis and will recognize the need to be able to obtain
funds on a fair basis in order to make it possible to shoulder the cost of
highway development.



ANNEX 1
Page 9
(3) Ports
Given effective planning and efficient operation, the ports of
Mexico would be able to meet the growing needs of international trade and
at the same time generate much higher earnings than at present, including
foreign exchange. To achieve these results, new policies, organizational
reform and political measures will be needed in order to:
(a)  Set the ports on a commercial footing and under the
management of specialized personnel.
(b)  Limit the role of the Customs Authorities to their
basic function, transferring responsibility for
warehouse supervision to the port authorities.
(c)  Implement a development strategy concentrating on
upgrading a limited number of ports, such as Veracruz,
Tampico, Salina Cruz, Coatzacoalcos, Guayamas, Manzanillo
and Mazatlan.
(d)  Refrain from constructing any new ports until the
existing ones have been improved substantially,
unless the construction of a new port is an
intrinsic part of an important industrial or
mining project.
(e)  Organize handling companies and other companies
performing port services so that they are run on
efficient and profitable lines.
Measures required to increase the efficiency of the planning and
operation of the ports include the following:
(a)  A recruitment and training program with a view to enaging
the services of top quality technicians (engineers,
economists, analysts, financial experts, etc.) to work
on the staff of the agency responsible for port operations.
In order to be able to introduce a modern system of port
operations in the short term, it will be necessary to
establish systems of supervision and accounting so that
traffic studies and other specialized work can be carried
out in conjunction with Mexican and foreign advisers
and also a training program for Mexican personnel to be
conducted in Mexico and elsewhere.
(b) The abolition of the restrictions currently in force
that prohibit freight trucks from entering port areas.



ANNEX I
Page 10
(c) The carrying out of studies dealing with:
(i) The economic growth potential of transport and
transport requirements, including port require-
ments - for the following corridors:
Mexico City - Veracruz
Guadalajara - Manzanillo
Coatzacoalcos - Salina Cruz
Monterrey - Tampico
(ii) The potentiality and feasibility of river trans-
port (preliminary studies).
(iii) The problem of cargo transfer from one mode of
transport to another. In some ports it seems
that the cost of transferring cargo from the time
it enters the port until it comes alongside ship
sometimes exceeds the total cost of transporting
the goods from their point of origin until enter-
ing port, and vice versa.
(iv) The feasibility of using lighters to improve coast-
wise trade, in view of the capacity of Mexican
shipyards to produce lighters and tugs of high
quality.
(v) The economic feasibility of a port and industrial
area in the Matamoros region and the possibility
of integrating it with Brownsville (IJSA).
(4) Civil Aviation
This subsector is technically in a good position to play an
important role in the future economic development of Mexico, especially
in the field of tourism and the transport of export goods by air. For
this potential capacity to be realized, the public, semi-public and private
organizations which now have a say in aviation policy, and which number more
than twenty, must be grouped together under the supervision of one unit.
This unit would be ultimately responsible for bringing civil aviation policy
in line with Government objectives. As regards the coordination of civil
aviation with the rest of the transport sector, this is obviously the re-
sponsibility of the Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT). Major
objectives will be:
(a) To revise the present national airport plan in the
light of past development and future demand, establishing
priority needs that require minimum further investment.



ANNEX 1
Page 11
(b) To assist Aeronaves de Mexico and Compania Mexicana de
Aviacion to improve their operating efficiency and their
financial performance.
(c) To raise the standards of air safety in Mexico.
The measures proposed to accomplish these objectives are:
(a)  The reorganization of the SCT.
(b)  The re-establishment of the Airport Planning
Committee within the SCT.
(c)  A group of major studies as follows:
(i) The air traffic market inside and to and from
Mexico, including charter flight operations.
(ii) The location and appropriate scheduling for
the expansion and improvement of airports.
(iii) The present system of routes and tariffs.
(iv) Investments, organization and other operations
needed to develop the transport of exports by air.
(v) The feasibility of and the benefits to be gained
from the joint use by Aeronaves and Mexicana of
ground facilities for passenger handling, aircraft
maintenance facilities, etc.
(vi) The implications of having only one international
airline.
(vii) The setting up of a system for the better utilization
of the official air fleet for civil air service.
In view of the fact that Aeronaves is in financial difficulties due to an
excessive debt, a decision will have to be taken as to whether this company
should be refinanced.
It will also be necessary for Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares
(Airports and Auxiliary Services) to pay the Federal Government returns on
the capital that the former has invested up until now in airports and also
on capital it invests in the future which could easily amount to about Ps 2
million in the course of the next six years.

(5) PEMEX Transport
The volume of oil products transported is extremely great and there-
fore calls for considerable investments. In 1969 the traffic of oil products
amounted to 19 billion ton-km whereas total traffic by rail amounted to 21.5
billion ton-km. During the last five years PEMEX's investments in transport
and storage amounted on average to more than Ps 600 million, i.e., two-thirds
of the average investment made by the railroads. PEMEX's decision to invest
in pipe lines, port installations and tankers is having serious repercussions
on other forms of transport and on the railroads in particular. To avert this
situation, SCT will take the initiative and will encourage PEMEX and the
railroads to cooperate to ensure that the most economic solutions are adopted
to solve PEMEX's transport problems.
(6) Urban Transport
Although many of the problems afflicting the urban transport do not
fall within the jurisdiction of SCT, their economic and social effect is a matter
of national concern. The study of the transport problems of Mexico City prepared
by the World Bank Mission recommends that no major investments be made until
studies and surveys have been carried out. SCT will have to help with this
task.

SECRETARIAT OF COMMUNICATIONS
AND TRANSPORTATION: RAILWAYS POLICY -
After a number of meetings between representatives of various
public entities connected with transportation in this country, held at the
Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) with the main object
of devising a general concept or policy for transportation, we have arrived
at one for the railways which, of course, represents a general consensus of
the participants. It is as follows:
"The basic policy decided upon in line with overall objectives
is to ensure that railway administration is guided by business management
criteria, not only operational and social criteria.
The SCT and the railway companies, in collaboration with the Sec-
retariat of the Presidency and the Secretariat of the Treasury and Public
Credit, will lay down the basic guidelines that will serve as a frame of
reference and a yardstick for evaluating results. These guidelines will
include the following:
(a) Preparation of a plan establishing quantitative targets
for traffic growth, operational efficiency, employment,
earnings, investments, etc. These targets will be the
yardstick for evaluating the companies' real progress.
(b) Introduction of an effective cost accounting system in
order to:
(i) provide a basis for fixing tariffs that reflect the
costs entailed at different levels and for different
types of demand; and
(ii) to be able to evaluate the net rate of return on
investment projects.

of Directors of the Mexican Railways held on April 12, 1971 under the
chairmanship of the President of the Republic.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
(c) Establishment of a modern management system that will
allow timely decisions to be taken on railway operations.
(d) Upgrading of railway marketing and market research
activities.
(e) A study of passenger and branch-line services to determine
which of them are uneconomic and, where possible, phase them
out.
(f) Selective increases in freight and passenger tariffs, combined
with a system of continuing review of tariffs, to ensure that
the revenue from each service covers at least the costs that
would be saved if that service were not provided.
(g) Preparation of a detailed employment plan, the minimum aim
of which should be not to increase the number of jobs for
the next 6 years. This plan should establish programs for
reassigning and retraining senior staff under a special
training program both in Mexico and abroad.
(h) Programming the diversification of railway activities to
ensure that they provide an integrated transportation service.
(i) The setting up of an analysis unit to examine the economic
feasibility of projects for investment in railway infrastruc-
ture, works, equipment and material.
(j) If necessary, the hiring of domestic and foreign consultants,
for specific assignments to be carried out in a set period
of time, who will undertake to train Mexican executives and
personnel.
The efficiency of the measures mentioned above will be reinforced
if the following measures are also adopted:
(a) Speedy completion of the amalgamation of the railway systems.
(b) Elimination of the 12.2 percent tax on gross earnings with
respect to freight.
(c) Assistance to the railroads in obtaining foreign loans on
more favorable terms than those obtained recently.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
(d) Elimination of practices that are no longer justified whereby
the railways provide various services to the government without
recovering their cost (e.g., mail carrying, reductions on
passenger fares, etc.).
(e) Making arrangements for the appropriate specialized agency
to attend to administration and provision of medical services
and payment of pensions and all other social security allow-
ances, rather than having the railways pay these costs directly.
(f) A decision not to construct any new lines until progress has
been made with implementation of the new coordinated trans-
portation policy, except in the case where the new investments
form part of an industrial or mining project with blanket
authorization."
After this general policy had been established the attached action
list was drawn up.

main bodies active in the railways sector: the SCT, the Secretariat of the
Presidency, the Secretariat of Public Works, the Secretariat of the Treasury
and Public Credit and Mexican Railways. These meetings, held in the confer-
ence room of the Undersecretariat of Communications and Transport, were also
attended on occasion by representatives of CONASUPO, PEMEX, the Secretariat
of the Navy and Almacenes Nacionales de Deposito, S.A., who were invited to
state their views and report on problems connected with rail services. The
relevant files contain summaries of all the meetings, at which the following
plan of work was outlined. This plan will also form the basis of the agenda
for discussions with World Bank staff during their visit scheduled to begin
on March 15 this year.

Analysis of Railway Role Through 1976
Introduction
1.        To test the viability of financial projections and related action
programs as described in this Report, this Annex studies the past and future
evolution of main indicators of N de M actively, namely freight and passenger
traffic in a strongly competitive environment and its relationship to GDP
and tariff level. All the data have been taken from Annex 18, the main
source being N de M and SCT statistics. Money amounts are at constant prices.
The result of the exercise is summarized below. The last paragraphs of the
Annex compare rail and road operating costs in Mexico.

2.        The critical targets which must be achieved in order to reach fi-
nancial viability over the 1971-1976 period are:
(i)  increase of freight (14% over 1973-1976) and passenger
(19%) tariffs;
(ii) substantial increase of labor productivity (27% in
traffic units; 14% in revenues per wage unit); and
(iii) moderate increase of net assets (4.5%).
The feasibility of passenger and freight tariff increases is described below.
The actions tending to higher labor productivity are described in paragraphs
3.06 and 3.12 of the text. All tariff and labor programs are incorporated
in N de M's Plan of Action.
3.        A conclusion of the above table is that the additional revenues
generated under the plan will go
(i) to the staff (23% payroll increase);
(ii) to the railways (14% revenue increase over payroll),
and from there, to users, by means of the commercial
action.
Traffic and Tariffs
4.        To test the aggregate traffic forecasts and the market reaction to
an increase of railway tariffs, the elasticities of freight and passenger
traffic to economic activity and tariff level have been measured using the
model
log traffic = AO + AI log GDP + A2 log average revenue
In the case of passenger traffic, GDP per capita has been used. Constant
prices have been used, deflating the freight revenues by the wholesale price
index, and passenger revenues by consumer price index. The result, and its
projections, through 1976, are as shown on page 3.
5.        The projections of revenue increase in real terms through 1976
appear to be statistically consistent with: (a) the existing trend of eco-
nomic growth; and (b) the market reactions in a competitive environment.
Railway Costs
6.        The following paragraphs describe the test carried out to check
the feasibility and economic rationale of the new system for railway rates
devised by the Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes (SCT).
7.        SCT has calculated a new railway freight rate system based on the
following principles, in each length of haul and commodity:

(a) it will cover railway long run variable costs, in-
cluding vehicle depreciation and way maintenance;
(b) it will be below road rates;
(c) it will take account of the difference in quality
of service between road and rail.
At the average length of haul of carrying the commodity by railway, the new
tariff system follows the proportion:
Highway rates = Highway transport cost (including road maintenance)
Rail rates      Railway operating cost + estimation of difference
of railway/road service quality
This proportionality, however, has been adjusted by SCT in short hauls (a)
by reducing somewhat the theoretical railway tariff to give the railway a
chance for competition, or otherwise (b) by increasing the tariff, discourag-
ing the use of railway in short hauls, when the theoretical railway tariff
could not be reduced further without falling below marginal cost. In long
hauls, the adjustment has always been downwards to pass on to users any pos-
sible surplus.
8.        Out of 116 commodities recorded in the SCT tariff study, Table A
at end of Annex studies 28, representing about two-thirds of N de M traffic,
and lists them by decreasing order of ton-km as given in 1970 N de M statis-
tics. Using the SCT charts which plot rail and road operating costs and rates
for each commodity in function of the length of haul, column (6) represents
the new railway rates, column (7) represents road rates, and column (8) is
the ratio road/railway rates. The adjustments referred to above in paragraph
6, as they have been made in hauls other than average, do not apply to the
table, which is a cross section of railway and road rates at the railway
average length of haul. Column (5) lists railway long run variable costs by
commodity, at the average length of haul, before making allowance for differ-
ences in the quality of service.
9.        First, the conclusions to extract from Table A are:
(i) Substantial rate increases are necessary in iron ore,
crude petroleum, sugar cane, coal, maize, and sorghum
seed. These commodities account for about 30% of N de
M's freight traffic but generate 60% of freight traffic
deficit;
(ii) Rate increases are also necessary in coke, cattle, wheat,
fluorite, asphalt, fertilizers, baryta, sulphur, animal
feed, and sawn timber, which, accounting for about 20% of
N de M's freight traffic, generate 18% of freight traffic
deficit;



ANNEX 3
Page 5
(iii) Rate increases are also granted in commodities, such
as gas for fuel, cellulose, mineral of zinc, lime and
many others where the railway can offer an adequate
service and still have rates well below road rates.
10.       Second, the railway and road costs obtained will be used as proxies
for the calculation of economic benefits carried out in Annex 17. Next para-
graph tests the appropriateness of the road operating costs as obtained in
Table A.
Road Costs
11.       The average road operating cost obtained from the sample of 28 com-
modities, 1.84 x I 10.3/tkm = j 18.9 tkm, can be calculated as follows (data
from SCT and SOP; taxes excluded):

consumption have been calculated; gasoline represents, since 1966, about 68%
of motor vehicle consumption, and diesel represents 32%. Second, cost of
motor vehicle consumption of gasoline and diesel has been estimated. Tile
road maintenance expenditures divided by the cost of fuel consumed and multi-
plied by the percentages mentioned above give the ratios (a) road maintenance
expenditures attributable to gasoline/gasoline cost, and (b) road maintenance
expenditures attributable to diesel/diesel cost. The ratios are about 10%
for gasoline and about 16% for diesel. The proportion of gasoline attrihut-
able to trucks should be higher than 10%, as this 10% is the average between
trucks and private automobiles, which are assumed to cause lower maintenance
expenditures; further refinement is not justified, however, for purposes of
calculating the average road transport cost of paragraph 11.

MEXICO
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Outline Terms of Reference for Consulting Services in N de M
Objective
1.         The objective of the Consultants' services is to assist
the Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico (N de M) in its policy of
operating on sound business principles so that it may play its
proper role in the transport sector of the country with maximum
efficiency, and to train Mexican national personnel in modern railroad
techniques, taking into account the rapid technological changes in the
industry.
2.         As a start toward this goal, the Consultants' services will
provide assistance in the implementation of a Program of Action and
training personnel in the following areas:
(a) Electronic processing;
(b) Telecommunications;
(c) Costing, financial targets and budgeting;
(d)  Line and terminal operations, including
locomotive and car control;
(e)  Preparation of a Corporate Plan including
manpower planning; and
(f) Locomotive and car maintenance.
The specific sub-areas are detailed in paragraph 8.
Scope of Consulting Services
3.         In the conduct of this work, the Consultants shall cooperate
fully with N de M, which will assign counterpart personnel to work with
the Consultants.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
4.         The studies of the World Bank in 1963 and 1970, as well as
the report of Tecsult Interamericana S.A./Canadian National Railways
and the reports on the 1972-1973 Investment Plan, will forn the
basis of assistance in the fields mentioned in paragraph 2.
5.         It is intended that the work shall be divided into two
stages, extended over 24 months. The first stage is not expected to
require more than three months' work for a team of seven highly
qualified experts who will define objectives in writing and establish
written programs of action to achieve maximum efficiency in each of the
six mentioned fields. The team shall have a coordinator and a deputy
coordinator who shall be of different disciplines (e.g., engineer and
economist/financial expert) and shall remain in Mexico over the 24-month
period of Consultants' assistance. The second stage of implementation
will begin immediately upon completion of the first stage. In the first
two   months of the second stage, the recommendations of the Consultants
will be reviewed by N de M and the recommendations resulting thereof will
be sent to the Bank for comments. Upon reception of Bank's comments,
N de M's management will decide with the Consultants which parts of the
Program of Action are to be implemented by N de M's staff and which parts
will require further Consultants' assistance. The five Consultants not
staying permanently in Mexico will make periodic visits to N de M during
the second stage to observe the progress that has been made in their
respective field of action and to offer further advice as may be necessary.
6.         The total work load of the Consultants will cover at least
72 man-months, but this may be increased to a maximum of 98 man-months if
and when the Bank, with the agreement of N de M, considers that work in
all or any of the fields of action shall so require. The experience and
qualification of the individual experts proposed by the Consulting firm will
be subject to Bank approval.
7.         The Consultants shall make progress reports available to
N de M at about three monthly intervals. N de M will make available to
the Bank a copy of these reports as soon as possible.
8.         The specific sub-areas of Consultants' assistance are:

to total operating revenue, excluding any subsidies paid by Government
to N de M and the amounts payable under paragraphs 4 (iii) and 5 (c)
of the Plan.
2.        N de M shall establish, no later than December 31, 1972 or such
other date as shall be agreed with the Bank, a traffic costing system
allowing the determination of:



ANNEX 7
Page 2
(a) the avoidable cost of passenger train operation (shown
separately for first and second class passenger transport)
and of mail and express services; and
(b) the long-run variable cost of freight transport by commodity.
3.        In order to achieve the operating ratios set forth in the table
included in paragraph 1 of the Plan, N de M shall, inter alia, recommend
to Government and take all action necessary for the implementation of such
recommendations:
(a) the amount to be paid by Government, starting no later than
July 31, 1972 or such other date as shall be agreed with the
Bank, for the carriage of mail by N de M;
(b) not later than December 31, 1972, a program for the curtail-
ment or abandonment of, and/or increase of fares for} passenger
transport and express services with deficits, such program to
be designed in such a way as to eliminate said deficits; and
(c) the introduction from time to time of adjustments in N de M's
rates, fares and other charges.
4.        N de M shall from time to time, beginning not later than July 31,
1972, recommend to Government (i) such adjustments of its freight rate as
shall be necessary to cover at least long-run variable costs: (ii) a pro-
cedure for the identification in N de M's accounts of the subsidies given
to users of N de M's services in case Government should not authorize the
said adjustments in freight rates; and (iii) the amount to be paid by
Government to N de M as compensation of losses if Government should not
authorize the curtailment or abandonment of services or the increases of
fares referred to in paragraph 3 (b) of the Plan.
5.        To eliminate deficits on low density branch lines, N de M shall:
(a) carry out a cost study of branch lines with low density
traffic, to be completed not later than December 31, 1973
or such other date as shall be agreed between the Bank and
N de M ( outline terms of reference in Annex 8);
(b) taking into account, inter alia, the recommendations of the
studying referred to in the preceding paragraph 5 (a), take
all action, including the request of all necessary authority
from Government, to reduce operating costs; and
(c) recommend to Government the amount to be paid by Government to
N de M as compensation of losses if Government should not
permit N de M to take the actions for which authority has



ANNEX 7
Page 3
been requested pursuant to the preceding paragraph 5 (b),
such compensation to be paid within six months after the
referred to authority has been requested.
.6.       It is recognized that N de M should achieve by no later than
1981 a financial position permitting it to pay all operating expenses,
service all its debt and make a contribution equal to at least 40% to
its investments thereafter, and to this end the financial projections
and associated actions of N de M shall be reviewed and adjusted
periodically with the Bank according to the progress made in the
1972-1976 period.

APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
A.   N de M's branich lines of low traffic density
(Based on IBRD, "An Appraisal of the Development Program of
Mexico", WH - 137 a, July 13, 1964; volume V, Annex IV, Transportation;
Part I, Railway Revenues and Accounts, Viability of Light Traffic and
Lines (page 83)).
1.        On the basis of net avoidable expenses, or difference between
avoidable costs and revenues to be lost if the lines are closed, 4,150
route-km of N de M were studied in 1964. Avoidable costs comprise track
maintenance, maintenance of line-side buildings, station staff, train
running costs and direct supervision. Revenues to be lost apply to all
traffic using the lines, whether originating and terminating on it or not;
this may be an overestimation of revenues and, therefore, the avoidable
losses given by this calculation are, if any, a conservative lower floor.
Freight operating revenues were calculated from an analysis of freight
traffic distribution by remitting and receiving stations. Passenger re-
venues were based on the average revenue per train-km for the whole rail-
way, that is, passenger trains at Ps 11.66/train-km and mixed trains at
Ps 3.04/train-km. As mixed trains are confined generally to sections of
low traffic density, and passenger trains are not run unless they carry
a minimum number of passengers, the use of average revenues per train-km
in those branch lines is not expected to introduce distortions.
2.        Since 1964, very few changes in traffic have taken place on the
passenger side and costs may have increased by about 20% after making
allowance for economies of operations. The 1971 report estimated (Volume
II Part A - Railways, para 3.40) that the possible excess of direct oper-
ating cost over revenues in 1970, to be avoided by closure of the lines,



ANNEX 8
Page 2
was about Ps 90 million (US$7.2 million). The excess of revenue over out-
of-pocket cost is estimated at about Ps 36 million in 1970 (US$2.9 million).
The list of these lines, which showed in 1964 an excess of direct operating
cost over revenues, is as follows:

23.  Maravatio-Zitacuaro                                 92.2
Total       2,593.9
3.        An assessment was also made in the 1964 Report of further 1,547 km
of N de M lines, showing losses on direct working expenses that are roughly
estimated at about Ps 35 million (US$2.8 million) in 1970. In the case of
these lines, however, the surplus of revenue over out-of-pocket expenses on
traffic hauled to and from the sections over the remainder of the system
amounts to a figure that is estimated at about Ps 47 million in 1970 (US$3.8
million). If the whole of this traffic were to be lost as a result of closing
these branches, a net loss estimated at about Ps 12 million would result to
the railways. If only 50% of the traffic were to be lost, the closure of the



ANNEX 8
Page 3
lines would result in no saving to the railways. This group of lines should
be studied separatelv and in more detail, and the present profitability as-
sessed. The lines are:
24.  Ixtepec-Ciudad Hidalgo
25. Rodriguez Clara-San Andres Tuxtla
26. Julia-Balsas
27. Los Reyes-Cuautla-Atecingo

33. Yurecuaro-Los Reyes
34.  Penjamo-Ajuno
B.   Outline of Terms of Reference for a Study of Low Density Lines
in the Government's Railways
4.        The avoidable costs and revenues of the 34 lines listed in para-
graphs 2 and 3, plus the lines that the railways and the Government deem
necessary to study, will be calculated as outlined in paragraph 1 above.
The lines will he ranked by decreasing order of net avoidable expenses (excess
of direct costs over revenues to be lost if the line is to be closed). The
study will, comprise two phases.   In Phase I a comparison will be made for
each line of the annual avoidable expenses with the annual incremental cost
of road transnort to haul the traffic now being carried by the line.  If the
road incrementnl cost is not more than 50% of the avoidable railway expenses,
the study will conclude at that point with the recommendation that railway
service should be discontinued.  If incremental road cost is more than 50%
of the railwav cost, the study of the line will continue to Phase II.
5.        In Phase II of the study, a forecast will be made of total trans-
port demand on the existing and potential transport services for 15 years,
taking into account planned development likely to generate additional traf-
fic. The economically appropriate division of total traffic between exist-
ing or potential alternative modes of transport and the railway line in
question will he estimated on the basis of (a) the short-run marginal costs
(i.e. avoidable costs) of each alternative and of the railway line, and
(b) the costs of distribution that are related to the particular mode,
including warehousing, inventories loss and damage, etc. The effects of
any planned or potential cost-reducing investments or operational improve-
ments in the railways - as contemplated in the Program of Action or Corpor-
ate Plan - and competing modes of transport will be taken into account.



ANNEX 8
Page 4
6.        A comparison to obtain the least cost solution will be made between
(a) the present value of the total investment and operating cost streams on
the assumption that an alternative (or group of alternatives) must carry the
total estimated transport volume, and (b) the present value of the total in-
vestment and operating cost streams on the assumption that railway services
would carry any part of the total volume and the remainder would be carried
by the alternative transport modes. A discount rate of 15% will be used.
7.        If it were found that the least cost solution over the 15-year
period would involve discontinuance of particular railway services, the year
for the discontinuance would be that in which the savings in avoidable costs
to be made by discontinuing railway services are larger than the increasing
costs in that year involved in carrying the total traffic by the alternative
transport mode plus the discount rate (15%) multiplied by the value of any
investments required immediately upon discontinuance of railway services in
order to handle the forecast railway traffic by the alternative transport
mode.
8.        The annual net avoidable expenses obtained by the studies of the
lines will be reimbursed by the Government to the railways as provided in
the undertakings of the Government.

APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Traffic Costs
Extracts from Report No. PTR-88,
Volume II, of May 13, 1971
B.   Passenger Train Services
3.11      The revenue earned by passenger trains (i.e. passengers, baggage,
express and mails) falls far below the costs that would be immediately
avoided if the services were not to be provided. It makes no contribution
to joint passenger and freight costs or to fixed costs. On the basis of
a "fully allocated cost," passenger train services are responsible for over
80% of the railway operating deficit. Recognizing that it would be unreal-
istic to expect within the foreseeable future that fares and other charges
could be raised to the extent needed to recoup all the costs incurred in
providing the services, the mission has fixed upon immediately "avoidable
cost" as a measure by which the adequacy of fares and other charges, or
the justification for continuing a service, may be judged.
3.12      In determining avoidable cost the most generous assumptions have
been made. For example, in the case of engine-house maintenance for loco-
motives only the cost of materials used for the repair and maintenance of
passenger locomotives has been considered to be an avoidable passenger cost.
Labor costs have been excluded on the assumption that should passenger ser-
vices be discontinued the same number of men would continue to be employed,
although less intensively for the maintenance of freight locomotives only.
Similarly, in marshalling yards which handle both freight and passenger
trains no part of the cost has been classified as avoidable passenger cost.
This is on the assumption that the same number of yard locomotive shifts and
yard gangs would be employed if passenger trains were to be discontinued
and only freight trains remained to be marshalled. Such assumptions possi-
bly understate the avoidable passenger cost, but even so the position in
1968 was calculated as follows:

C. Freight Rates
3.27      The cost study indicates that freight rates for the majority of
commodities are sufficient to cover long-run variable cost and make a con-
tribution to fixed costs. The rates which fail to meet this test are for
the most part those on minerals (iron-ore, coal, coke, manganese, baryta
and fluorspar), although sugar cane - on short hauls - some minor agricul-
tural and industrial products, turpentine, charcoal and livestock fall into
the same category. While there are indications that the "value of service"
principle has influenced rate-fixing, the average rate charged for each
commodity (as reflected by the average revenue per ton-km) generally bears
some relevance to factors which influence costs, e.g. loadability and length
of haul, even though the actual costs themselves are not known. The mission
was informed that a study to determine traffic costs was well advanced on
the Pacifico and was about to be started on the Nacionales. Such studies
are long overdue. The proposal for unification of all the railways will ne-
cessitate the design of a new and comprehensive tariff structure. This is
a task which, if it is to achieve its purpose of encouraging optimum use of
the railways' economic resources, will require a thorough knowledge of costs.
3.28      In Mexico much has been said in support of the concept of the
railways as a public service rather than a profit-earning enterprise and
"the greatest contribution to public service which the railways can make
is to ensure they carry all the traffic for which they are most economic-
ally suited".  Such generalizations do not provide any criteria of success
or failure.  The fact that a railway carries increasing volumes of traffic
is not evidence that it is operating in the national interest.  To achieve
the latter goal means that the economic and social costs of the resources
consumed in the provisions of each service and movement should be known.
Once this information is available, the tariff or pricing principles for
a railway are (a) no rate should be below the marginal cost of providing
the service, (b) no rate should be set so high that it diverts to or fails
to attract from competitive modes of transport any traffic which the rail-
ways can carry at a lesser economic cost, and (c) in the case of "captive"
traffic, it is not set so high as to inhibit the demand for the goods in-
volved by excessive monopoly pricing.
3.29      Increased attention and emphasis should be placed on a determina-
tion of the appropriate rate for each commodity. This means increased re-
search and market analysis by the railway, including information about com-
petitors' activities. For many of the high rated goods which produce a
high multiple of long-run variable cost coverage, a trend has appeared
which shows a reduction in the railway haulage relative to nationwide pro-
duction. While this situation has occurred to a much greater degree in
other railways of the world, the Mexican railways may be unconsciously
contributing to this loss of profitable traffic because of rates which



ANNEX 10
Page 3
are higher than those which would maximize the use of the railway as the
most economic mode of transport. Truck competition has already captured
a significant portion of high rated traffic, and for each commodity in
which serious inroads seem to have been made the railway rate at the av-
erage length of haul is considerably higher than the long-run variable
cost at this distance. Consequently, rate studies of high value commod-
ities should be made to evaluate the overall financial effect of bringing
them closer to long run variable cost. The railway must attempt to fore-
cast the impact of technological change in the trucking industry, as well
as follow road development, to assess the ability of truckers to make
further inroads into the traffic still carried by rail. To determine
the optimum rate for low value commodities, studies should be undertaken
to assess the effect on the demand for rail transport of higher final
prices to consumers when transport rates increase.
3.30      Even though reducing rates on certain high rated goods would
increase the return to the railways in the long run, the short run effect
may be to reduce revenues. To compensate for this, the railways should
test the demand elasticity for low rated traffic also. The effect of
raising rates on low rated commodities with inelastic demand for rail
transport would result in an increased net return which could be sus-
tained, since the increase would still not be sufficient to attract truck
competition. Government may, however, decide that it is not in the public
interest for the railways to raise rates on those low rated commodities
which produce revenues sufficient to cover long-run variable cost and
make some contribution, however small, to fixed cost.  In the case of
rates which fail to cover long-run variable cost, however, they must
obviously be raised to a level sufficient to cover such cost and, where
the state of competition allows it, by a further amount to make a contri-
bution to administrative and other overheads. If subsidies are essential
to sustain the production of, for example, iron-ore and baryta at Alzada
this can in no way be considered a proper function of the railways. In
examining a number of commodities the mission assumed a minimum accept-
able railway rate to be that which covers long-run variable cost plus
25%. This contribution to fixed cost is less than half the average con-
tribution that must be made by all freight traffic if the railways are
to attain financial viability. The analysis was applied to: (a) commod-
ities the revenue from which on the Nacionales now falls to cover long-
run variable costs, and (b) those which now fail to cover the costs plus
25%. The results which are summarized below indicate that on this basis
additional revenues of Pesos 128 million might accrue. In practice, how-
ever, there is an elasticity of demand effect to be considered.

3.32      For the remainder of the rates little comment is necessary.  The
spread between the highest and lowest suggests that "value of service"
pricing still has some influence in rate-fixing. By comparison with most
other railways, however, the influence of this factor in Mexico is rather
limited. The two commodities which provide the highest multiple of long-run
variable cost coverage are illustrative of the continuation of "value of
service" pricing:

ANNEX 1 0

3.33      Translated into US standards these commodities produce an
average revenue of 1.86 and 1.94 US4 per US ton-mile; in many countries,
these figures would be considered not only as reasonable but also, when
considered against the costs of other transport modes, would be thought to
be reasonably safe from competition on the basis of transport price only.
Road transport prices in Mexico, however, are very low; so low, as sug-
gested elsewhere in the mission's report, as to raise doubts that road
transport operators pay the economic costs of providing and maintaining
roads. Taking this factor of low competitive prices into consideration
and the higher quality of service which the road transporter can often
give, the price-fixing flexibility available to the railways is more than
usually limited. As a result, the railways must increase their service
competition to attract traffic.
3.34      The present railway tariffs and the related class rate structures -
there is a separate one for each railway - are in need of complete revision.
The unification of the railways under one management that is under discussion
would offer an ideal opportunity for this to be done. At present, each rail-
way has its own system of class and special or commodity rates. On the Nac-
ionales only 5% of its traffic moves under class rates; on the other railways
class rates account for 30% to 75% of total traffic. There are no through
rates and traffic moving over more than one railway is charged separately
for the distance it is carried on each railway. The number of special, or
commodity rates, under which most traffic now moves are innumerable. Be-
cause costs are unknown, it is probable that many rates are set in an arbi-
trary or discriminatory manner. Experience in other countries has shown
that there is no greater deterrent to railway traffic than a multiplicity
of over-elaborate tariffs. The same situation must exist in Mexico where
railway tariffs are probably comprehensible only to a tariff expert.
3.35      In revising the tariff structure, care should be taken to avoid
the excessive taper on the class-rate curve which has been a feature of
earlier tariffs. At very short distances the class rates have been too
low to cover terminal costs; at medium distances they have been too high
and have encouraged road competition, and at long distances have again
been too low to cover variable line-haul costs. The mission suggests that
an intensive study of freight traffic costs should be undertaken and, on
the basis of its findings, a unified tariff should be designed in accord-
ance with the principle laid down in paragraph 3.28.

ANNEX 17

MFXICO
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Cost Effectiveness Analysis
1.        This Annex presents an analysis of the following points:
(i) What are the benefits of N de M's project, its likely in-
ternal economic rate of return, and the most sensitive
variables which should be acted upon to obtain a higher
return;
(li) What are the benefits attributable to every major invest-
ment item in the 1972-1973 Investment Plan and the returns
obtained.
A.   The Whole Project (N de M's 1972-1973 Investment Plan and
1972-1976 Plan of Action)
2.        Investment costs used in the computation of the internal economic
return (IER) have been taken from Annex 12. Additional operating costs due
to the Plan of Action are accounted for in the "with" column of N de M's
operating cost, Table A. Benefits streams, summarized with explanatory
notes in Table A of this Annex, come from avoiding freight traffic diversion
to road and from reducing N de M's operating costs. Negative benefits come
from retaining some passenger traffic. All computations are at 1971 prices.
3.        In the sensitivity analysis, overruns of +8% in investment and up
to 100% in additional costs of uneconomic passenger traffic have been tested.
The elimination of passenger deficits after 1976 has also been analyzed. On
the side of the benefits, percentage changes of +10% and -25% have been tested
in road operating costs, corresponding to either (a) best estimate traffic
diversion to road, and road transport costs between ].ex 0 18.9 and Max 0
12.9/ton-km, or (b) best estimate road transport cost, and "with" freight
traffic growth of 5.2% p.a. and -2.5% p.a. respectively, compared with the
best estimates of 3.3% p.a. (para. 3.16 of report). Percentages of +25% have
been tested in benefits coming from reducing railway operating costs. The
variations of the variables used here appear reasonable in view of road
transport costs calculated in Annex 3, paragraph 11, the traffic forecast
worked out by N de M and summarized in Annex 9, and railway operating costs
summarized in Annex 18.
4.        Out of the total number of IER obtained with various combinations
of costs and benefits, the extreme, most unlikely cases have been disregarded.
Among the likely IER values obtained and ranked between the extremes accord-
ing to their probability, the minimum and most probable IER are:



ANNEX 17
Page 2
(M) 17%, obtained with 8% investment overrun, 25% overrun in
uneconomic passenger traffic and 25% underrun of benefits
coming from avoiding traffic diversion to road; and
(ii) 22.5%, obtained with the best estimates of costs and benefits
of Table A.
An IER equal to 22.5% has been used for the cross-checking of benefits of
paragraph 18 below. The returns obtained are satisfactory when compared
with the opportunity cost of capital in Mexico.
5.        To obtain a higher IER, the most sensitive factors under control
of N de M and Government are, in this order: (a) early implementation of
the project, (b) implementation of the commercial action contemplated in
the Plan of Action of secure new traffic, (c) reduction of N de M's op-
erating costs, and (d) elimination of uneconomic passenger deficits after
1976.
B.   Evaluation of Main Items of N de M's Investment Plan
(a) Ways and Structures
6.        Investments of Ps 328 million in 1972 and Ps 397 million in 1973
have been evaluated under this heading. Main items are:
(i) Ps 150 million for bridges, mainly in the lines Tampico-
Monterrey-Veracruz. Benefits will come from allowing lo-
comotives in excess of 30 ton-axle loading and, therefore,
heavier trains. Benefits will reach Ps 7 million in 1974
and 1975 and will increase with traffic thereafter by im-
proving axle load by 50% and reducing accordingly the number
of locomotives and rolling stock operating in the lines for
a certain traffic level;
(ii) Ps 236 million for rehabilitation of 690 km of high traffic
densitv lines. The new track rehabilitation plan will con-
tinue the program of "cascading" rail to upgrade secondary
and branch lines and reducing the rail classifications, which
are 25 at present. Gross traffic in the lines to be rehabil-
itated varies between three and nine million gross ton/year,
and traffic between 63 and 215 million gross ton has been
carried on these lines over the last 20 years. Higher speed
and about 25% improvement in turnaround for rolling stock and
motive power will result in savings of at least Ps 30 million
in 1974, calculated as savings in depreciation of rolling stock
and motive power used to carry about 31 million gross ton over
the rehabilitated lines. Benefits will increase in following
years.
(iii) Ps 220 million for timber sleepers. Out of 2,390 reportable
train accidents (most of them minor) for the period 1967-1970,
902 were attributable to defective aleeDer condition. The 1972 and



ANNEX 17
Page 3
1973 program for replacement of four million sleepers will catch
up some of the deferred maintenance and will save at least
Ps 26 million in 1974 by avoiding accidents. In the "without"
section it is assumed that, if there were no replacement of sleep-
ers in 1974 in the sections needing it, and accidents in-
creased, traffic would decrease substantially in 1975; there-
fore, there would be in 1975 a lower level of traffic and ac-
cidents than in 1974. The savings of avoided accidents have
been estimated at Ps 6 million in 1975. Ps 21 million could
be saved in 1974 by improving turnaround of rolling stock and
motive power.
(iv) Ps 40 million for train maintenance equipment, including (a)
a wrecking crane and 40 new longitudinal ballast hoppers to
carry out the ballast program for 1972 and 1973, (b) a new
250 ton capacity diesel crane, and (c) replacement of wornout
train machinery (about 10% of existing stock). The "without"
alternative selected for the evaluation of benefits is the
ballasting and maintenance of track by using more labor and
wornout equipment; and the benefits to be obtained are about
Ps 17 million, evaluating labor savings at shadow wages half
of actual ones;
(v) Ps 50 million for line revision and extension of crossing
loops. Line revision (Ps 25 million) will take place in
Cuichapa-Xuchilea, and the elimination of extreme gradient
and curvature will allow saving of at least half of direct
operating costs in light traffic density sections over a
distance of 35 km; this represents savings of about Ps 3
million p.a. Extension of 40 km in 48 crossing loops (Ps 25
million) will allow longer trains to be accommodated in high
traffic density lines (Guadalajara-Irapuato-Mexico City-Nuevo
Laredo) and will save direct costs of train operation which
are estimated at about Ps 7 million p.a. in 1974.
7.        The IEP obtained by addition of all costs and benefits is 14%.
(b) Telecommunications
8.        Investments of Ps 126 million in 1972 and Ps 63 million in 1973
have been evaluated to calculate the benefits attributable to investment in
telecommunications. The following assumptions have been retained:
Costs
(i) Investments to be carried out in 1972 and 1973 will start to
produce benefits only in 1974;
(il) Although labor savings have not been accounted for in the bene-
fits, skilled labor has been incorporated into operating costs.



ANNEX 17
Page 4
Benefits
(iii) Since usage of locomotives is already being improved by better
working rules, no benefits coming from improvement in locomo-
tive usage have been attributed to telecommunications. The
same applies to freight car usage to a certain extent: improve-
ment of car usage from present 60.0 car-km/serviceable car-day
to 60.6 in 1975 is attributable to investment in telecommunications,
but further improvements are attributable to the Program of Action,
and so are accounted for in paragraph 15.
(iv) Better service to users is implicit in the freight traffic
forecast of Annex 9. For a given level of freight car usage,
benefits as described in (iii) would increase as fast as freight
traffic increases. To avoid an overestimation of benefits,
freight traffic and benefits have been assumed constant after
1975; in other words, the first year benefits (FYB), or bene-
fits in 1975 have been taken as a best estimate of the internal
economic return. The "without" situation in this investment
is equivalent to the "with" situation used in evaluating in-
vestments in ways and structures;
(v) The main benefits are a reduction in the number of freight cars
necessary to move a certain traffic, by improving of the turn-
around time and the number of car km per serviceable car day.
The number of cars saved by an improvement of usage has been
calculated following the same procedure as in Annex 13. The
cars have been valued at US$15,500 each, which is a shadow value
(80%) of the average market value (US$19,500) estimated in the
project for new cars to be purchased by N de M.
9.        An IER of 20% has been obtained for this investment.  It corresponds
to benefits of about Ps 244 million in 1974 and Ps 13 million in following
years, equivalent to savings of 1,260 and 67 freight cars, respectively.
(c) Locomotives and Spare Parts
10.       Benefits of acquisition of locomotives and spare parts and one-
third of shop machinery have been calculated, assuming that all other invest-
ments have taken place. Investments evaluated are Ps 194 million in 1972
and Ps 243 million in 1973. Using N de M data, locomotive running costs
(line and yard) ranged in the last five years between Ps 9 and Ps 14 per km
of a 25 year-old locomotive, excluding depreciation and at usage levels of
about 60,000 locomotive-km per locomotive in traffic. Ninety new 3,000 HP
locomotives are expected to have running costs between 25% and 40% below
old locomotives running costs due to a reduction of fuel consumed and some
reduction of manpower-km obtained with higher speed and easier and shorter
routine inspections. In addition, parallel improvement of operations and,



ANNEX 17
Page 5
in particular, locomotive usage amplifies slightly the impact of the reduc-
tion of running costs; the benefits of improvement of locomotive usage due to
improved operating techniques and upgraded workshop machinery are therefore
accounted for in this investment. The "without" traffic situation here is
equivalent to the "with" situation in telecommunication investments. A
figure of 90,000 locomotive-km per new freight locomotive in traffic has
been used in 1974, resulting in 3.8 million freight locomotive-km for the
90 new freight locomotives minus about 10% permanently in workshops. Further
improvements of locomotive usage are expected beyond 1974. Combining the
ranges of original running costs of old locomotives, reduction of running
costs, and improvements of locomotive usage, the best estimates of benefits
to be expected from reduced running costs are between Ps 10 and 22 million
in 1973, between Ps 26 and 40 million in 1975, and are expected to increase
thereafter as locomotive usage improves.
11.       Locomotive maintenance costs have been compiled by consultants
(para. 1.04 of main text of this Appraisal Report); general repair costs
every 150,000 km range between Ps 75,000 per year for a new 1,500 HP loco-
motive to Ps 120,000 for an old 1,620 HP locomotive; consultant's average
range estimate of Ps 3 to Ps 5 per locomotive-km run and year, including
all periodic inspection, coincide with SCT evaluation of locomotive costs.
The 3.8 million freight locomotive-km to be serviced by the 90 new locomo-
tives at maintenance costs below Ps 3 per locomotive-km will produce savings
reaching about Ps 11 million in 1973 and three times as much in 1975, when
compared with higher unit maintenance costs of more and older locomotives.
Labor savings have been excluded by taking shadow maintenance savings equal
to 65% of maintenance savings at market value.
12.       All benefits range between Ps 53 and Ps 82 million in 1975.  IER
ranges between 13.7% and 20.6%, best estimate being about 17%.
(d) Freight Cars
13.       Benefits attributable to purchase of about 2,800 freight cars,
1,000 sets of roller bearings and two-thirds of workshop machinery have
been measured as the savings of avoiding diversion of freight traffic to
road. Total investments evaluated are Ps 539 million in 1972 and Ps 349
million in 1970.
14.       N de M has been making excessive use of foreign cars in the past;
the foreign freight cars held by N de M were about 25% of total fleet in
1968, and about 20% in 1970. It is not economic for N de M to operate such
a large amount of foreign cars because considerable operational problems are
created and there is also the risk of foreign owners (mainly US and Canadian
railways), who do not consider this practice acceptable, retiring freight cars
and producing a sudden shortage of moving capacity in N de M.  As a consequence,
N de M has started to replace foreign cars by national ones. Foreign freight
cars are expected to be 7% of total N de M's fleet in 1974.



ANNEX 17
Page 6
15.       As shown in Annex 13, the number of new freight cars to be pur-
chased takes account of improved car load and turnaround time brought about
by investments in telecommunications and consulting services. To avoid double
counting, the "without" situation of car usage is the same as the best esti-
mate "with" situation used in the evaluation of investments in telecommunica-
tions, i.e. 60.0 car-km per serviceable car day in 1973, 60.3 in 1974,
and 60.6 in 1975. The "with" situation is 63.0 car-km per serviceable car
day in 1973 and 65.0 in 1974. The traffic to be moved by the new freight cars
is about 740 million ton-km in 1972, and reaches 1,730 million ton-km in 1975,
based on normal availability standards for new freight cars.
16.       On a long-run variable cost basis, 1975 railway freight operating
cost is expected to range between Mex J 8.6 and 10/ton-km at 1971 prices,
depending on whether the present difference up to fully distributed cost
is maintained or reduced (Annex 3, Table A, and Annex 18, page 2). If the
freight traffic to be served by the cars was to be diverted to road, the
cost of moving it would be about Mex J 17.2/ton-km (Table A, footnote 4/).
Since the potential traffic diversion to road is a small part of total
carrying capacity of Mexican truck fleet (100 billion ton-km/year, para.
2.02 of report), no substantial improvement in truck average load should be
expected. In summary, the cost difference road/rail would range between
Mex d 7.2 and 8.6/ton-km, the best estimate being Mex d 7.9/ton-km. The
benefits are estimated at about Ps 160 million in 1975; the probable IER
range between 19% and 23%, and the best estimate of the IER is 21%.
17.       On a financial basis, the return would be higher than 30  and the
revenues foregone by the railway equal to about Ps 225 million in 1975 if
the freight cars were not purchased and freight traffic subsequently lost.
18.       Summary.  The following table summarizes the results obtained in
the evaluation. The benefits attributed to the Plan of Action are calculated
by difference.

1/ Based on Annex 9, through 1976; 2.5% growth p.a. between 1976 and 1979; stable thereafter.  This long ter  traffic forecast assumes that, if the Project is corred mat, N de N can inerese-
its traffic by boht one third in the next decode.
2/ It has teen av--ced a-coulattie tine logo in the with and witul-ot height traffic situations: one year by 1973, one and a ha1f by 1975, three by 197P.
3/  This potential traffic direroion  suld bo mainly cased by not purchasing now freight corn uotil 1975; additional potential traffic ioss beyond 1975 are attributed to lack of omrelal action.
4/ A road transpert cost equol to Men t 17.2/ton-km has been coed, calculoted  -s follows: Road transport root in 1970 as an overage is 6 18.9/ton-lk  (Annex 3, paragraph 10).  This coat is ossoemd to
re-a-n  the  -ane in 1971, 00 gcat-er t-uck efficisncy abo brho iflationary cost increae.  Ths froight traffic diversion tn rood is estirated as aboat 2% cf rood carrying capacity (see psragraph 2.02)
and would in-rease average load femc 50% e-timated in An-ce  3 to 55%.  Thersfore, th  resulting road transport coot is e 18.9/1.10 - d 17.2/ton-ho.

6/  It is -r-noed that pasnengor traffic would increase at 2% p.a. if no measores ame taken to avoid it (An-. 18, page 2).  Highest parsenerr carrying capacity will be reached in 1976.

MEXICO
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND RAILWAY PROJECT
Income Account
Elaboration of the Bases of the Projection
The revenue projection is simply a translation into figures of
the implementation of Government's stated railway policy and the Plan of
Action agreed between Government, N de M and the Bank. The traffic
forecasts are those of the N de M, as discussed and agreed with the Bank.
A.   Operating Revenue
I.        Passengers
The Report on the Transport Sector of Mexico of September 10, 1970,
made the recommendation that "Passenger revenue should be equated to at
least "avoidable costs," by raising fares and/or abandoning services; where
a service cannot be made to pay and yet must be retained for social reasons,
the Government should reimburse the railways for the loss".
It is not possible in this appraisal report to forecast the rela-
tive proportions in which the problem of equating revenue to avoidable cost
will be solved (a) by increasing fares, (b) by reducing services or (c) by
Government subsidy of the users of the service. Revenue and costs of passen-
ger services are therefore projected as if no alteration to the existing
state of affairs were to take place, and net adjustments are made in the
Income Account for "Estimated additional net revenue from abandonment of
passenger services and/or increase in fares" and for "Reimbursement by Gov-
ernment in respect of unprofitable services maintained in the public interest."
Passenger traffic, assuming the "status quo", is forecast to grow
at 2% p.a. On this basis the costs, revenues and subsidies with respect to
passenger services are forecast as follows:

1974               486            80             142           40          120
1975               509           120             130           67          160
1976               518           160             118           69          171
It is appreciated that solution of the problem of equating revenues
and costs will require careful study and difficult decisions. It is not there-
fore expected that costs and revenues will be balanced prior to 1976.
These forecasts are based merely on a rough assessment of the savings
which might be secured from abandonment of about one-third of existing passen-
ger services and the maintenance of the remainder on the accepted principle
that revenue and avoidable costs must be equated, either by incr3easing fares
or by Government subsidy where the section of the population served by the
trains is too poor to pay even the avoidable cost of providing the service.
II.       Express
The revenue of the express service is sufficient to cover the ter-
minal costs of providing the service, but not the cost of transport. It can
be argued that the incremental cost of adding an express car to a passenger
train is little more than the cost of providing and maintaining the car, plus
a negligible addition to the fuel bill. However, it might with equal reason



ANNEX 18
Page 5
be contended that each service provided by a passenger train should bear its
share of the cost of running the train proportionately to the amount of train-
space which the service occupies. On this basis the share of passenger train
avoidable costs attributable to express service in 1970 was estimated to be
Ps 72 million. How costs and revenue from express services can be equated,
either by reducing services or increasing rates, cannot be determined in
this appraisal report. Much will depend on what decisions are made to cur-
tail passenger train services. The Transport Sector report of September 1970
stated "whatever concept of cost is applied, it is certain that at existing
charges express traffic does not pay. Rates should be raised to the extent
which will provide revenue at least equal to avoidable cost, or the service
should be discontinued if its price at this higher level is non-competitive.
It is difficult to believe that adequate alternative road services do not
exist for this type of traffic." This statement is still pertinent. The
projection simply assumes a traffic growth of 2% p.a., in line with the
growth of passenger traffic. Economies of operation, reduction of service
accompanied by a corresponding reduction of staff, and increased rates will
improve financial results of operation to a degree not taken to account in
this projection.
III.      Mail
Up to the present the railways have received only token payments
for carrying mail. Government now accepts the principle that the carriage
of mail by the railways should be paid for on the basis of avoidable cost
as a minimum.  As from 1968 these costs are expected to evolve as shown be-
low, calculated as a proportion of total passenger train avoidable costs
relative to vehicle-km run.

IV.       Freight
The projection of freight revenue assumes the implementation of the
following proposals, all of which have been adopted as part of the Plan of
Action approved by Government and the N de M:
(a)  The retention by the railways as from 1972 of the
12.2% tax on gross freight receipts.
(b)  Freight revenue to be increased in 1972 by about
Ps 250 million (i) to compensate for the added cost
of the 1970 Labor Law and (ii) to cover long-run
variable costs for all commodities. Government
will not agree to raise rates to the public in
1972 or 1973, but accepts the principle that rates
should cover long-run variable cost and make some
contribution to fixed costs; on this basis, Gov-
ernment will pay into railway revenue a user subsidy,
identifiable by cawnodAty and user. It is assumed
that such payments will be made as from July 1, 1972.
(c)  Freight rates to be raised in 1974 and again in 1976
to the extent necessary to compensate for erosion in the
value of the currency.
The calculations are as follows:
Ton-km    Revenue at    Tax on            Increase    Government  Total
existing      gross receipts  in rates    subsidy

The suggested rate ncraaes are the minimum needed to compensate
for projected increases in labor costs. These in turn reflect the projected
trend of the consumer price index. If inflation should be less than pro-
jected, the upward trend of wages and rates would be moderated.
B.   Operating Expenses
I.        Staff Costs
The projection is based on the assurance that the labor force will
not be allowed to increase above its present level of about 59,000 men. Wage
awards are forecast to increase individual earnings by about 15% every two
years, or by more than 53% in the six years from 1970 to 1976. Social security
costs are expected to increase at a similar rate. For comparison, the actual
movements in wages and productivity in the six years 1964-1970 and the cor-
reponding movements projected for 1970-1976 are as follows:
Increases
1964 - 1970          1970 - 1976
Increase in wage levels at
current prices                    45%                   53%
Increase in consumer price
index                              22%                  312
Increase in real wages               20%                  17%
Increase in productivity
per man employed in terms
of traffic units                   38%                  27%
II.       Fuel, rails, etc., other materials and general expenses
These are forecast to increase proportionately to train and
locomotive-km and the volume of traffic handled. Fuel prices are further
increased by 20% to meet a prospective increase in PEMEX prices.
III.      Freight-car rental
After the peak of 1970/71 it is expected that investment in new
cars will enable N de M to reduce the number of foreign cars on line to a
fairly stable level of about 4,000 cars, at a rental of Ps 60 million a
year.
IV.       Depreciation
The increase in depreciation provision is proportionate to the
projected increase in train-km.

V.        Reimbursement by Government of social security costs in excess
of those'paid by private industry
The principle that the railways should not pay more by way of
social security costs than their counterparts in private industry has been
adopted by Government as part of its railway policy. The railway adminis-
tration is preparing a case for relief in this regard but so far no formula
has been evolved. The Bank's estimate of a reasonable cost to the railways
is based on a comparison with other railways in developing countries where
reasonably generous pensions and other social benefits are enjoyed by rail-
way workers. It can be shown that rarely does the cost of pensions, eitlher
in the form of actual payments or contribution to pensions funds based on
actuarial studies, exceed 20% of the wages and salaries bill, and that med-
ical and hospital costs are normally less than 10% of payroll costs. For
the purposes of this projection,the relief from excessive social costs has
been calculated at the amount by which pensions and medical and hospital
costs combined exceed 30% of payroll costs, as follows:
Payroll  Pensions   Medical and   Total pensions   30% of   Difference
hospital costs  and medical and  payroll
hospital costs

(Note:  During negotiations,the projections of payroll costs were changed
in the light of more up-to-date information then made available.
As the above figures are merely illustrative of one of several
approaches which Government may choose in applying the principle
set forth in the statement of railway policy, it is not considered
necessary at this point to change the figures in the last column.)
