REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO ETERROCARRILES NACIONALES
DE MEXICO AND MACIONJAL FINANCIERA S.A. WITH THE GUARANTEE
OF THE UNTITED MEXICAN STATES FOR A RAILWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Ferrocarriles 'Tacionales de Mexico (Nacionales) and Nacional
Financiera, S.A., with the guarantee of the United Mexican States for
the equivalent of $75 million, to help finance a project for modernizing
and renewing Nacionales' railway equipment and improving its operations.
The loan would have a term of 25 years, including five years of grace,
with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - BATK LENDING TO MEXICO
2.        My report and recommendation (P-1036) dated April 19, 1972,
which was distributed in connection with a proposed 3Bnt loan for a pbrts
project, gave recent information on the Mexican economr and its prospects,
and summarized the Bank's past and planned activities in Mexico (for the
relevant sections of that report, see Annex IV attached). As indicated
in that report, the port loan and other loans to Mexico planned for pre-
sentation during the next few months total over $250 million. After
taking into account scheduled repayments during the disbursement period
of the new loans, Mexico's total outstanding debt to the Bank would
increase by about $143 million (from the present total of about $839 to
$982 million at the end of FX1975). If the Bank made no further loans
to Mexico and Mexico did not increase further her outstanding external
debt during this period the Bank's share in the total would increase
from about 20 to 23 percent. However, Mexico will undoubtedly be
borrowing extensively during the coming years to meet the growing ex-
ternal financing requirements of the economy and is looking increasingly
to the Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank in order to help meet
these needs and improve the maturity pattern of her external debt.
3.        In addition to the loans I expect to present for your considera-
tion during the next few months, there is a substantial number of projects
which are at an earlier stage of preparation or review including projects
for rural development and education. Future lending will, of course,.
depend on progress made in preparing suitable projects, as well as on
Mexico's economic performance, particularly in fiscal matters, the
balance of payments and investment planning. If the level of Bank lending
were to average $200 million per year during the next five years, the
Bank's share in Mexico's external debt would increase from about 20 per-
cent at present to 25 to 30 percent by 1980.



-2-
Mexico faces difficult long-term structural problems arising from a
rapidly growing population, the need to improve conditions within
rural areas and to start to reduce income disparities. At the same
time development requires substantial capital which has to come from
additional public savings if excessive reliance on foreign borrowing
is to be avoided. Given sound fiscal policies the near term prospects
of the econony appear favorable. Manufactured exports are expected
to continue to expand rapidly. External reserves are equivalent to
about 5 months imports. Service of the external debt absorbs about
20 percent of exports and non-factor services and is not projected
to increase above that level over the next 10 to 15 years. In the
light of past performance and present prospects I believe Mexico is
creditworthy for the foreign borrowing presently contemplated. At
Annex I is a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments in
Mexico. Country data are at Annex TT.
PART II - THE PROJECT
The Transportation Sector
4.        Over the past three decades Mexico has added an extensive net-
work of high quality Federal highways, satisfactory secondary road
network and an air transport system to a large network of railways and
ports, resulting in a fairly well advanced transport system. Govern-
ment emphasis is now shifting more to the development of tertiary,
feeder and access roads to permit the integration into the modern eco-
nomy of some 20 million people who live in isolated villages and farms.
The Mexican transport sector has grown rapidly but a lack of coordination
has resulted in some misallocation of resources and ad-hoc subsidies
have prevented the optimal division of traffic among various transport
modes. Each system was developed without adequate consideration of the
other modes because the responsibility for operating and maintaining
existing and designing new transport facilities had been dispersed among
numerous government departments and agencies.
5.        The Government of President Echeverria, which took office in
December 1970, has recognized the need to attack the basic problems of
transport and accepted most of the major recommendations of the report
of the Bank's transport sector mission (PTR-88 dated May 13, 1971)
which was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 7, 1971. The
Echeverria Administration quickly initiated a series of actions to
strengthen transport planning and operations. The measures which have
been taken to improve port operations were summarized in my recent report
and recommendation for a port loan. The Government also has been developing
measures to strengthen the institutional framework of the sector and to
help to improve the division of traffic among the various modes. A sector
planning office has been set up within the Secretaria de Comunicaciones y
Transportes (SCT) to develop and coordinate long range transport policies
and investment priorities, and make a comprehensive study of the present
road user charge system to determine to what extent road user charges may
be distorting competition, particularly between rail and roads.



-3-
6.        Mexico has five railways, all government owned, with a total
route mileage of nearly 20,000 kms. Nacionales is by far-the largest
railway enterprise with 14,000 route km; the second largest is Ferrocarril
del Pacifico with 2,300 route km. Both are autonomous agencies with a
common management. The remaining five are directly under the SOT.
Nacionales operates with generally good equipment and track, but utilization
of motive power and rolling stock is poor. Its main problem is a large
operating deficit, that results from the fact that tariffs were not in-
creased for a decade to compensate for increasing costs. Most of the
deficit is caused by extensive passenger services provided at very low
rates. The Government has strengthened the top management of the rail-
roads and has been giving particular' attention to tackling the heavy
burden on the Federal budget resulting from the large and growing
operating railway deficit.
The Project
7.        The proposed railway project forms part of the Mexican Govern-
ment's effort to improve the efficiency of and reduce subsidies to the
transport sector, particularly by helping to modernize the equipment of
Nacionales, improve the utilization of its manpower and rolling stock
and reduce its financial deficit. The project combines Nacionales
1972-73 Investment Plan and its 1972-76 Plan of Action for improving
its operations and financial situation. Both the Investment Plan and
the Plan of Action take into account the recommendations of the Bank
transport sector mission and a team of consultants from Canadian National
Railways who worked in M4exico in 1970 and 1971. The main features of
the project and the proposed loan are summarized in Annex III.
8.        The total cost of the 1972-73 Investment Plan of Nacionales
is estimated at $203 million with a foreign exchange cost of $113 million.
Of the total expenditure, some 26 percent is for freight cars, 16 percent
for locomotives, 26 percent for renewal and maintenance of track and
bridges, 8 percent for terminal and maintenance shops, 8 percent for tele-
communications and 16 percent for other purposes.  Rirther details are
sho,vn in Annex III.
9.        The proposed Bank loan would cover the following items:
$ millions
1,400 new freight cars                                 25.0
Imported components for freight cars reserved
for local procurement                                 4.4
1,000 roller bearings and axles to rehabilitate
old freight cars                                      1.7
Workshop equipment                                      2.5
690 Km of rails and fastenings                         15.7
2 million hardwood timber sleepers                      8.5
Way maintenance machinery and equipment                 2.6
Telecommunications equipment                            7.0
Consultants' services                                   1.2
Unallocated                                             6
75.0



Procurement
10.       All goods to be procured under the proposed Bank loan would
be subject to international competitive bidding. The main foreign
exchange component of the Investment Plan which would not be covered by
the proposed Bank loan consists of 90 locomotives to be procured with
bilateral financing of which 40 have already been ordered. Nacionales
does not wish to increase the number of makes of locomotive beyond the
two it already has and since the benefits of standardization would out-
weight the advantages of international competitive bidding it will
divide the procurement between the two firms in question. Passenger
and express cars are also expected to be financed on a bilateral basis.
11.       Fifty percent of the freight cars would be acquired through
international competitive bidding and would be financed from the loan;
the remainder would be reserved for the domestic state-owned producer,
Constructora Nacional (Constructora), which has been an efficient
producer of high-quality cars. The Bank would finance only imported
components used for the production of these cars. For freight cars
delivered in 1973 under the reserved portion, Constructora has agreed
to keep its prices at not more than 5 percent above the 1972 level;
for 1974, when a new labor contract will be effective, the price ceil-
ing has been fixed at 125 percent of the average of Constructorats
1973 prices and the lowest foreign bid on the freight cars to be
financed under the loan through international competitive bidding.
Constructora would also tender under the international bid portion and
would be granted a preference of 15 percent for evaluation purposes.
12.       Two million softwood sleepers would not be financed by the loan,
but will be reserved for the numerous low-cost Mexican suppliers, mainly
peasants, who produce them from pinewood in the northern part of the
country. Two million hardwood sleepers would be procured under the loan
with international competitive bidding.  Although there are hardwood
trees in the jungles of the southeast, they are not easily accessible
and it is therefore unlikely that Mexican manufacturers will participate
in the international bidding.
Financial Aspects
13.       The Investment Plan summarized above will help to reduce the
large operating deficit of Nacionales by modernizing its equipment and
improving its efficiency.  A much more important contribution towards
this objective will be made, however, by the Plan of Action, which
Nacionales and the Government would be committed to carry out and which
is designed particularly to reduce the deficit. It had been caused
mainly by the fact that for a period of almost 12 years rates and fares
were held constant while costs have steadily increased. Exceptionally
low passenger fares and extensive passenger service account for mucb of
the operating deficit. In addition Nacionales carries certain kinds of
cargo, mainly minerals (iron ore), grains and livestock at rates that
are below long-run variable costs.



-5-
14.        The main feature of the Plan of Action is the preparation
and carrying out of a corporate plan to reach a series of objectives,
particularly that of holding total staff to existing levels, improving
the utilization of rolling stock and motive power and thereby greatly
reducing the operating deficit of the railways by 1976. The Plan of
Action also includes the following steps to improve Nacionales' operations:
(i) the employment of consultants to advise and direct the
improvement of corporate and manpower planning, line and
yard operations, locomotive and car control and mainten-
ance, telecommunications, costing, accounting principles
and financial forecasts and control;
(ii) the establishment of a traffic costing system before the
end of 1972, which would allow Nacionales to determine
the avoidable cost of passenger train operation and
long-run variable cost of freight transport by commodity;
(iii) a study to be finished by the end of 1973 proposing
measures to reduce the deficits caused by low traffic
density lines;
(iv) payment by the Government of the cost of carrying mail,
beginning in 1972; and
(v) a program to cover losses on passenger train services by
1976, either by increasing tariffs, curtailment of
service or Government compensation where curtailment
will not be authorized.
15.        In the Plan of Action, net operating ratios (i.e. ratios of
total operating expenses to total operating revenues, excluding any kind
of Government subsidy) have been established for each of the years 1972
through 1976. They would improve from 1.66 in 1971 to 1.43 in 1972 and
1.17 in 1976. These ratios reflect the expected results of various
productivity and financial measures in the plan and increases in freight
tariffs of 325 million pesos in both 1974 and 1976. The Bank pressed
during negotiations for an earlier increase in those tariffs which are
currently below marginal costs, which would have made possible a more
rapid improvement in the operating ratio. The Government accepted the
principle that tariffs should be raised in line with costs, but it was
not prepared to make a firm commitment to increase railway freight tariffs
before 1974. It maintained that there had to be increases in prices
charged by a number of public agencies and to put these all into effect
over a short period would cause too many dislocations. In these circum-
stances the Government considered that the increases in electric power,
petroleum and water tariffs should take priority. Achievement of full
financial viability, defined as the ability to cover operating expenses,
service debt and provide a 40 percent contribution to investments, is
envisaged to be attained by 1981.



-6-
16.       The loan includes $0.5 million for consulting services to aid
Nacionales in carrying out the Plan of Action, as well as $0.7 million
for consultants, training programs and scholarships to aid in building
a sector planning office within SCT and carrying out a comprehensive
study of the present road user system. Provision has been made for
the possibility of financing retroactively some consultants services.
Economic Evaluation
17.       The railway project is economically well justified.  Nacionales
carries a large share of road and rail transport, mainly bulky products.
It has contributed to economic growth by carrying an increasing volume
of goods at low and steadily decreasing cost in real terms. Even with
increased tariffs as proposed, Nacionales can carry most goods,
particularly bulky commodities, at considerably lower costs than alter-
native modes over distances of 150-2000 kms. The project will improve
operating efficiency and introduce a tariff system designed to attain an
optimum division of traffic among competing modes of transportation. The
economic rates of return, which take into consideration the reductions
of railway operating costs and the savings in road operating and con-
struction costs that result when lesser volume of freight traffic is
diverted to roads, range from over 20 percent for telecommunications to
14 percent for ways and structures. The average rate for the four major
investment items is at least 17 percent.
PART III - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
18.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank, Nacionales and
Nacional Financiera, S.A., the draft Guarantee Agreement between the
United Mexican States and the Bank, the Report of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement
and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
19.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART IV - RECOMMENDATION
20.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

EXTRACT FRaH TIE PRESIDEiT'S REPORT A9D RECOIi1-DDATIOJS CU A PROPOSED
IDAH TO flACIGIAL FfIXICIBRA FOR A PORITS PROJECT (P-1036 DATED APRIL 19,
1972-.)
8.        lexico, with a GDP of around i35 billion a year, ranks closely
behind Brazil as the Bank' s second largest borrower in terms of loans
outstanding. Its economy is comparable in size to Brazil and larger than
that of any other country to which the Bank Group is lending except India.
llexico has been remarkably successful in sustaining a 6-7 percent annual
growth rate over a period of 15 years, wTith only a moderate increase in
the general price level. This achievement is attributable to a unique
combination of historical and geographical factors, intelligent economic
and financial policies (exhibiting a high degree of pragmatism and freedom
from economic dogma) and a continuity in economic management unparalleled
elsewihere in Latin America. Taxation has been kept low (around 9 percent
of GDP), but private savings have been encouraged, and a considerable
proportion of these savings has been channelled into the public sector
tlhrough the banking system. UTational savings have been maintained at
close to one-fifth of GDP. and although there has been a significant
increase in the external deficit on current account since 1968, this
still constitutes less than 3 percent of GDP.
9.        T.here is another side of the picture to which attention has
been drawn in rny previous reports on Iexico. Of all countries in the
world with populations of comparable size, 1iexico has the fastest demogra-
phic growth rate. While per capita: income at current prices has risen
from tR200-250 a year in the middle 1950's to about .'70O a year today, the
increase in income has been very unevenly distributed. While organized
workers and the groning middle class have snared in the benefits of
economic development and a few people have become very rich, relatively
little has been done to alleviate rural poverty. Some 40 percent of the
population still depends on agriculture for a living, but agriculture
accounts for only 11 or 12 percent of the national income. Wlithin the
agricultural sector itself there is a sharp contrast betwieen the prosper-
ous conditions of the larger private farms, particularly in the irrigated
north and along the coast of the Gulf of iLexico, and the desperate poverty
of the small farmers in the central plateau and along tile central and south
Pacific Coast. Rural education and health have not been given much at-
tention; and away from the main roads, communications in most parts of
the country are still quite primitive.
10.       The Administration of President Echeverria, wihich took office at
the end of 1970, has laid great stress on the need to improve the conditions
of the poor and to correct inequalities in income. At the same time, how-i-
ever, the Government has beenIbrced to recognize the ccnstraints imposed
on the growth of the econorm by the widening gap between imports and ex-
ports and the increasing extermal debt which has kept the debt service
ratio above 20 percent in recent years. First priority has accordingly
been given to changes in economic policy and improvements in economic
managernent required to rmlaintain a satisfactory overall growth. As noted
in nm last report on -iexico, a series of new tax measures was enacted in



Annex IV
'Page 2
late 1970, sugar prices were increased, and steps were taken to strengthen
central control of public borrowing. At the same time, newi emphasis was
given to export promotion, and a scheme wras introduced under which manu-
factured exports are entitled to tax rebates up to 10 percent of export
value. A second fiscal package was adopted early this year, including
a new tax on income fron fixed-interest securities, an increase in mar-
ginal rates of personal income tax and tax incentives for industrial in-
vestment. There is also a new taxi equivalent to 5 percent of enter-
prise payrolls, the proceeds of which are to be used to finance workers'
housing through a 1,ational Housing Fund. The twJo tax packages together,
excluding the housing tax, are expected to increase federal tax revenues
by about 10 percent and should raise the ratio of taxes to GDP by approxi-
mately one percentage point.
11.       Public investment was deliberately held dowm in 1971 to protect
the balance of payments, and this was one reason ashy the real growth of
GDP slotted daon to 3 or 4 percent, producing something of a recession from
which industry may now be slowly recovering. On the more positive side,
there appears to have been a net reduction in medium and long-term ex-
ternal public indebtedness during 1971, made possible in part by a small
improvement in the current balance of payments, but more importantly by
a large inflao of short-term funds. International reserves increased by
4200 million during the year and now stand at well over 41 billion.
12.       Improved external debt management has been reflected in the
terms on wihich the Iiexican authorities borrowed in international capital
mark.ets during 1971. For example, loans with maturities of 1 - 5 years,
which accounted for over 40 percent of total external public borrowing
in 1970, made up only 12 percent of such borrowing during the first 9
months of last year. Two major operations concluded with consortia of
foreign bankcs for a total of "p220 million carry final maturities of 8
and 10 years from signing, wxith a grace period of 4 years in each case.
The public issue of D.ilO0 zaillion in Germany in I1ovember 1971 had a term
of 15 years, including 5 years of grace. Another issue of 1'40 million
rarketed in i!ew York, a short time ago has a term of 15 years. TZhis im-
provement in the terms of borrowing from private sources till makce it
easier for iexico to support a continued high rate of economic expansion
without endangering its credit standing abroad. There is, however, little
prospect of the country obtaining all the external capital it needs on
extended terms without substantial contributions froa the 13BRD and the
IDB which are the only official lending agencies in a position to offer
development assistance on non-commercial terms.
13.       Public savings in l.xico must also be increased if expenditures
on rural development and social services are to be raised to more adequate
levels, and tbis has been a constant theme of the Bankts economic reports.
As a result of the tax measures alreacdr described, there does appear to
have been some increase in federal government savings during 1971, and
the savings of the Federal District also improved slightly. On the other
hand, there has been a decline in the total savings of the three major
public enterprises (the national petroleum company, the federal power com-
mission and the railroads) from iHex:;3 billion in 1970 to !,bx$2.1 billion
in 1971, and this trend needs to be reversed - a matter of special concern
to the Dank in view of the proposed loans for railways and power.



Annex IV
Page 3
14.      The primary objective of Bank lending to RLoico has always been
to support the growith of the economny by providing long-term capital for
projects that can both behefit from the Bankts special expertise and
promise high dieeldpmental returns. At the same time, in the case of
the power program and the steel project now under consideration, both of
T*-ich have large import components, Bank participation helps i*lexico to
orgahtize financing from other sources on the basis of broad international
competitive bidding. The Bank has been associated with the pouer sector
since 1949, and while the federal power commission, with the Bank' a
encouragement, now looCA to export credits to meet a significant propor-
tion of its extemal capital requiremaits under joint or parallel fin-
ancing arrangeaents, the iiexican authorities attach great importance to
a continuation of Bank lending for power, particularly for financing
the foreign exchange costs of civil works and equipment for transmission
and distribution. The ilexican Government has also sought the Bankl's
financial and technical assistance for the development of the transport
sector, initially mainly for roads, but since the 1970 sector study., for
ports and railwiays as well.
15.      Power and transport apart, the Bank is giving special emphasis
to projects which directly help to strengthen the balance of payments,
since the balance of payments is liable to be a critical constraint on
economic developmient in an econonm tied to free convertibility of its
currency and heavily dependent at the margin on private capital inflow.
Thiis has been a;n important consideration in past lending for irrigation
(cotton) and tourism and in the lending now proposed for a newi industrial
fund. Additionally, nowi that it is the declared policy of the 1e,xican
Government to give more attention to the quality of economic develop-
ment, especially in rural areas, the Dank is interested in giving what
support it can to programs for education and rural development, and a
cornsiderable amount of staff time is currently being devoted to the
identification of possible projects in these twio sectors. Hownever, the
capital expenditures involved are likely to be quite small. Finally,
in View of the great potential scarcity of water in ilexico, plans are
going ahead for a national wJater study to be carried out w-ritlh the BankWs
help, possibly with some financing froa the UINDP, and a project for the
Supply of water to Iiexico City and adjacent urban areas is scheduled
for appraisal shortly.
16.      The choice of Bank projects in iexico is naturally governed to
an im9portant extent by the priorities of the iiexican Government and by
the availability of financing from other sources. Since in the past the
Inter-American Development Bank has been able to provide soft loans for
projects of a social character, and has also been more liberal in
financing local costs, i exico has sought its assistance in preference to
that of the I3RPD for such projects as feeder roads and minor irrigation
works. The main contribution to thie extemal financing of industrial
development in l exico has coma from export credit agencies and private
sources. Cver the period 1966-70, the 3an1c accounted for 11 percent of
the flowt of medium and long-term capital to ,.exico and the IDB for 5 per-
cent. These proportions are likely to be si&mificantly higher in future

in conformity with the i*edcan Government's aim of improving its external
debt structure, but the greater part of the capital wthich ;'exico requires
from abroad will continue to come from private financial institutions
and export credit agencies. "'
