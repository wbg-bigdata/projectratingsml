INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF
RWANDA FOR A THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Rwanda for the equivalent of US$6.3
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a third highway project.
Belgium has agreed to finance the preinvestment studies included in the
project, which are estimated to cost $560,000.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Recent Economic Developments and Prospects of
Rwanda" (AE-23a) was distributed on April 20, 1972. An economic mission
visited Rwanda in November 1973 and its report will be circulated shortly.
3.        Rwanda became independent in 1962. In July 1973 the army took
power and ended the regime which had been governing the country since inde-
pendence. A new government was formed in which several high officials of
the former regime were retained. The change in government was not violent
and did not affect economic activity. The Government has confirmed that it
is determined to pursue policies favorable to economic and social develop-
ment.
4.        Rwanda is one of the poorest countries in Africa with an annual
per capita income of about US$60, and is included in the UN list of the
25 least developed countries. The economy is predominantly agricultural and
subsistence production accounts for more than half of GDP. Coffee has been
the most important cash crop for several decades and currently accounts for
more than half of export earnings. Tea and pyrethrum were introduced recently
and their production is increasing. Prospects for livestock development are
also good. The only significant nonagricultural resources are limited quanti-
ties of cassiterite and wolfram ore which are being exploited for export.
5.        After independence Rwanda's economy suffered from social and
political dislocation and a concomitant decline in coffee production. The
economy recovered in the second half of the 1960s, and between 1964-1970
GDP increased by 60 percent in real terms. Coffee production increased,
as well as the export prices for both coffee and wolfram. Meanwhile, how-
ever, the population grew by 22 percent. In 1970-72 GDP practically stag-
nated at about $225 million but increased by slightly over 5 percent in
1973. Despite the increase in per capita GDP the standard of living is
woefully low. The pressure on natural resources is great and underemployment
is common.



- 2 -
6.        Although no statistics are available, income distribution appears
fairly even. The level of savings is low. Between 1969 and 1973 gross
capital formation rose by 6.5 percent per year but amounted to only 10 percent
of GDP in 1973. Public sector investment accounted for about half of this
total. About 70 percent of public investment was for basic infrastructure
and 15 percent for agriculture. Foreign aid financed about 80 percent of
public investment as well as a substantial part of current expenditures.
7.        Several constraints hamper Rwanda's development, among which popula-
tion pressure on scarce land resources, high transportation costs, a small
domestic market and the scarcity of skilled manpower are critical.
8.        The population density in Rwanda is 144 per square kilometer, one
of the highest in Africa. Nearly all arable land is fully occupied except
for certain areas where settlement has been prevented by tsetse fly. The
farmland available averages less than one hectare per family. Pastures are
overgrazed. The population is increasing at an annual rate of over 3 percent,
thus putting further pressure on land. Over 90 percent of Rwanda's population
is rural and most of it live at a level close to subsistence. Protein-caloric
malnutrition is endemic. With the scarcity of resources and continual popu-
lation growth, migration and population control may ultimately be the only
possible solutions. Regarding the latter, recent discussions held with re-
presentatives of the new Government that came into power in July 1973, show
that, gradually, a policy to introduce family planning may emerge. Migra-
tion on the other hand is severely constrained by the lack of opportunities
in Rwanda's adjoining territories.
9.        Rwanda's external trade is adversely affected by the high transport
costs caused by its landlocked position and long distance from the sea. Most
of Rwanda's merchandise is transported through Mombasa on the Indian Ocean,
a distance of 1,700 km. Domestic transportation is also costly because of the
poor condition of the national road 'network. In 1968-72 the value of oil
imports averaged about $1.5 million or 6 percent of total imports per year,
As a result of the rising fuel prices the value of oil imports is expected
to increase to about $4.0 million in 1975, representing about 11 percent of
total imports.
10.       The low purchasing power of Rwanda's population and the small size
of its domestic market limit the possibilities for industrial development.
However, there are some possibilities for the development of small to medium
size agro-based industries. With foreign assistance, the Government has already
started processing of tea and pyrethrum and the processing of groundnuts and
soybeans is also envisaged. Thus, foreign exchange earnings could be improved
by broadening the export package.
11.       Rwanda has, however, insufficient skilled personnel to meet even
its current need for technicians and managers and relies heavily, therefore,
on foreign technical assistance. This lack of trained manpower also inevitably
hampers project implementation and will continue for some time. The Government
is, however, introducing a reform of the educational system which would make
it more oriented to rural activities and geared to vocational training.



-3-
12.       The Government's principal development objective is in the agricul-
tural sector, in particular to expand production of export crops, such as
coffee, tea and pyrethrum. These objectives were laid down in Rwanda's first
development plan (1966-1970), from which a number of projects are still to
be completed. A second plan, which would continue the effort to increase and
diversify export crops, is under preparation. It is likely that an attemot
will be made to improve coffee yields through intensification of production
in suitable areas and that high priority will also be given to livestock
development, in particular on non-arable land in the eastern part of Rwanda.
13.       Rwanda receives a substantial amount of foreign aid; between
1969-72, commitments amounted to nearly $100 million, mostly in grant form.
The Bank Group share in this was about 12 percent. In 1972, foreign aid
financed about 540 technical assistants, more than half of whom were employed
in education. In financing its recurrent expenditures, the Government also
received budgetary support from Belgium, in particular for education, public
health, agriculture and transportation. The Government expects to receive
an increasing amount of foreign aid, particularly from European countries
and the European Development Fund (FED). During 1974-78 gross capital in-
flow is expected to be about $150 million.
14.       At the end of 1973 Rwanda's external debt amounted to about $39
million, including undisbursed, of which IDA accounted for $16.1 million
or 41 percent. The debt service burden which was less than 2 percent of
foreign exchange earnings in 1972 is expected to reach about 3 percent in
1980. Assuming some increase in IDA lending, by 1980 the Bank Group's
share in Rwanda's debt and debt service is expected to reach about 60 per-
cent and 15 percent respectively. The high share of debt owed to the Bank
Group is largely due to the fact that most other aid is given on grant terms.
Although the debt service ratio is low, external assistance should continue
to be provided on very soft terms in view of the country's poverty and limited
export potential. Furthermore, because of the lack of development capital
in Rwanda, foreign assistance should continue to finance a substantial part
of the cost of projects including local costs.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN RWANDA
15.       Since Bank Group assistance started in 1970, Rwanda has received
three IDA credits, totaling $16.1 million, of which 76 percent has been for
road improvement and maintenance and 24 percent for agricultural development.
There have been no Bank loans or IFC investments. Annex II contains a summary
statement of IDA credits as of March 31, 1974 and notes on the execution of
on-going projects.
16.       The Bank Group's initial development efforts in Rwanda have focused
on the improvement of the road sector on which the country is almost entirely
dependent for the movement of its domestic and foreign trade. The first IDA
credit of $9.3 million, was made in June 1970 for a road construction project



- 4 -
linking the capital, Kigali, with the Uganda border at Gatuna. This project
is cofinanced with the Belgian Government. Delays by the contractor and un-
foreseen geotechnical problems, together with, more recently, supply and price
problems related to the energy crisis, have hampered its progress (see Annex
II). The Association is examining with the Government the possibility of re-
ducing the scope and thus the total costs of this project, as well as the
feasibility of finding additional financing to complete it. The second IDA
credit, of $3.0 million, was made in March 1972 for a highway maintenance
project based on a UNDP-financed study for which the Bank was executing
agency. The project is cofinanced with the UNDP and the Federal Republic of
Germany. Some delays occurred at the beginning but the project is now pro-
gressing satisfactorily. The third credit of $3.8 million, made in November
1973 for an agricultural development project, aims at improving livestock
development and cash crop cultivation. Work is scheduled to start in July
1974.
17.       A major element of strategy for Bank Group operations in Rwanda
aims at increasing skilled manpower and improving the efficiency of Govern-
mental institutions through rurally-oriented education and vocational train-
ing. We are preparing a first education project in which emphasis will be
given to agricultural education. Our lending program also continues to
focus on agriculture and transport, two sectors which are closely related
and are crucial for increasing production, exports and employment. We are
currently assisting the Government in preparing an integrated agricultural
development project. Because of the shortage of skilled manpower and tech-
nical expertise in the country, development projects in Rwanda require sub-
stantial technical assistance and financial support for training facilities.
Both the second and the proposed third highway project provide for such
assistance.
PART III - THE TRA4SPORT SECTOR
18.       With no railways and only limited water transport on Lake Kivu,
Rwanda is almost totally dependent on roads for the movement of its domestic
and foreign trade. International air carriers connect Kigali with neighboring
countries and Europe, and two local firms provide limited air services to
several airstrips throughout the country.
19.       The highway network is quite extensive, consisting of about 6,300 km
of road, mainly low standard earth and gravel. About 3,000 km are designated
as national roads and maintained by the Directorate General of Roads and Bridges
(DRB) in the Ministry of Public Works and Equipment. The remaining 3,300 km
are local roads maintained by local authorities. Because of inadequate mainte-
nance resulting from a shortage of qualified staff in the DRB and lack of
funds and equipment, a large part of the national road network is in poor
condition. The current highway maintenance project aims at improving this
situation bv providing equipment and training for the staff through technical
assistance. The present staff of the DRB includes only 27 engineers and
technicians, of wlhom 16 are provided by technical assistance from the Federal
RZepublic of Germany, Belgium and the UNDP.



- 5 -
20.       Total highway expenditures by the Government have been considerably
less than total revenues collected from road users. While these revenues in-
creased steadily from 1970 to 1972, and amounted to almost $1.2 million in
1972, recurrent expenditures averaged only about $700,000 per year and capital
investments ir roads about $200,000. This situation is expected to change
during implementation of the Government's draft second five year plan (1972-1976)
which envisages an increase in road maintenance expenditures to about $930,000
by 1976, as agreed under the highway maintenance project. During the plan
period, revenues from road users are expected to increase at an average rate of
13 percent annually (as compared to 18 percent per year between 1970-1972).
About $3.0 million would thus remain for capital investments on roads projected
for construction during the second plan period.  Most of the financing for the
construction of about 1,000 km of main roads (at a cost of about $36 million)
in the second plan will, in the absence of other domestic sources of funds,
have to come from foreign aid.
21.       Rwanda is receiving foreign assistance for upgrading road connections
with neighboring countries in order to improve its outlets to the Indian Ocean.
The Kigali-Gatuna road, the reconstruction of which is being financed by IDA,
is part of the northern route from Rwanda, through Uganda and Kenya, to Mombasa.
The improvement of the Kigali-Butare road to the Burundi border is being financed
by the European Development Fund (FED). This latter road is part of the southern
route to the Indian Ocean, through Burundi and Tanzania, to Dar es Salaam. A
third route from Rwanda to Dar es Salaam is being studied with the assistance
of the People's Republic of China, which would link southeastern Rwanda by road
with the East African Railways at Ikusule in Tanzania.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
22.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Third Highway Project, Rwanda"
(No. 246a-.RW) is being circulated separately. The proposed project is based
on a UNDP-financed feasibility and engineering study of the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi
road, completed in February 1971 with costs updated in 1973. It was appraised
by an IDA mission in March 1973. Negotiations were held in November 1973.
The Government's delegation was headed by the Minister of Public Works,
Mr. Andre Katabarwa. As explained below in paragraph 31, presentation of
the project to the Executive Directors was postponed until the bids for the
construction works were received in order to determine more accurately the
cost of the project. A credit and project summary is provided in Annex III.
The Project
23.       The proposed project consists of:
(i) the improvement to two-lane paved standard of the Ruhengeri-
Gisenyi road (about 60 km);



(ii)  the feasibility study and detailed engineering of the Kigali-
Ruhengeri (116 km) and Ruhengeri-Cyanika (27 km) roads;
(iii)  technical assistance to the DRB Planning and Engineering
Division; and
(iv)  training of DRB highway maintenance personnel.
24.       The improvement of the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road is one of the high
priority projects in the Government's draft second five-year plan.   The road
serves the country's most densely populated and agriculturally rich region,
as well as one of its most attractive tourist areas, and carries transit
traffic between Zaire and Uganda. Gisenyi, on Lake Kivu, has a modern
brewery, coffee and tea processing industry, and is also a tourist resort.
The present road is poorly aligned for part of its length and its surface
deteriorated badly as a result of heavy traffic and insufficient maintenance.
Under the project, the road would be upgraded to two-lane paved standard,
to meet the expected increase of transit and local traffic. Drainage will
be improved, but no major bridge work is required. Detailed engineering has
been completed for the most difficult section but further engineering work
is required before construction of the remainder; the project provides for
completion of this work by the supervisory consultants.
25.       The project includes feasibility and detailed engineering studies of
the Kigali-Ruhengeri-Cyanika road wnich could lead to further highway invest-
ment by the Association. The present road is in poor condition and its re-
construction would provide Kigali with better connections to the north of
the country. Belgium has agreed to finance the studies. Detailed engineering
vitl be undertaken only if the feasibility studies give adequate indication
that construction is likely to be economically justified. Terms of reference
for such detailed engineering will be agreed with Belgium and the Association
(Section 3,05 of Credit Agreement).
26.       The present technical staff of the DRB's Planning and Engineering
Division is hard pressed to handle its present workload, and unless strengthened
would be unable to provide the services necessary to support the road construc-
tion atid maintenance program envisaged over the next few years. The Federal
RepublIc of Germany, which is already providing technical assistance, ba8
agreed to make available an additional engineer. Under the proposed project,
a transport economist would be employed for a period of two and a half years
to heip in the implementation of the ongoing highway investment program (1972-
76) and to draw up a highway development plan for the following years.
27.       Finally, the project includes an extensive training program for high-
way maintenance personnel to complement the effort being made under the ongoing
highway maintenance project. The program calls for practical training for
about 440 technical and administrative personnel. Audio-visual teaching aids
would be procured under the project and would be used by two training experts
recruited to coordinate and supplement the training provided by existing
staff (Section 3.06 of Credit Agreement).



-7-
PrLiect Execution
28.       The DRB in the Ministry of Public Works will be responsible for
executing the project and will be assisted by consultants for construction
supervision (including completion of detailed engineering) and for the
training of maintenance personnel. Construction is expected to begin in
August 1974 and to take about 18 months. The training program is expected
to cover a 2-1/2-year period.
Financing Plan
29.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$7.7 million with
a foreign exchange component of US$5.7 million. The proposed IDA credit of
$6.3 million would finance about 87 percent of total project costs (net of
duties and taxes estimated at $420,000). Belgium has agreed to finance the
preinvestment studies included in the project which are estimated to cost
$560,000. The Government contribution would amount to about $830,000 inclu-
ding taxes and duties.
3(0.      At the end of April, we were informed that UNDP might be prepared
to consider financing part of the project, in particular the technical
assistance program (including the training program for highway maintenance
personnel) and some of the consultant services. UNDP financing could be up
to $700,000. We have however been advised that a firm commitment would not
be possible for a few months. Since Rwanda would not have the resources to
finance this part of the project if UNDP financing does not materialize, we
have included this in proposed IDA financing, with the provision c:hat if and
when UNDP funds are made available, an equivalent amount of the IDA credit
would be cancelled (Section 2.03 of Credit Agreement).
Procurement and Disbursement
31.       Improvement of the Ruhengeri-Gisenyi road will be carried out under
contract after international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA
Guidelines. Because of the uncertainties pertaining to construction costs
resulting from Rwanda's landlocked position, it was thought advisable to call
for bids prior to presentation of the project to the Executive Directors.
Tenders were received in February 1974 and the construction costs have been
estimated oni the basis of the lowest evaluated bid.
32.       The proceecls of the IDA credit would be disbursed over three years
anci would cover; (a) 92 percent of expenditures for road improvement works and
(b) actual foreign exchange expenditures for supervision, technical assistance
and training. About $30,000 would be utilized to finance retroactively consul-
tant services to update cost estimates and to prepare tender documents for
the road improvement works (para. 3a of Schedule I to the Credit Agreement).
Economic Benefits
33.       The major benefit from the proposed project would be a considerable
reduction in vehicle operating costs. In addition, the reduction in transport



- 8 -
costs is expected to stimulate the development of the area served by the road.
The economic return of the project is estimated at 18 percent. As part of
the traffic, particularly that between Uganda and Zaire, is carried by foreign
transporters, or serves the foreign-owned brewery in Gisenyi, it is likely
that some of these benefits would not accrue to the Rwandese economy. On
the assumption that a third of the benefits from the road improvement would
be lost to the Rwandese economy, the economic rate of return to Rwanda alone
would be 12 percent. Furthermore, construction would provide temporary
employment for about 500 Rwandese.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
34.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Rwanda and the Association, the recommendation of the Committee provided
under Article V, Section I (d) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of
a resolution approving the proposed development credit, are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately.
35.       Features of the Credit Agreement of special interest are referred
to in paragraphs 24, 26, 29 and 31 of this report. An additional condition
ef credit effectiveness is the signing of a contract between the Government
of Rwanda and consultants for the supervision of road improvement.
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
37.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

B. PROJECTS IN El.ECUTION-
Credit No. 19oz-IW       Kigali-Gatuna Highvay Project:  $9.3 million of tune 11,
1970;  Closing DatE.: September 30, 1974.
The project consists of the construction and maintenance of
a paved road between Kigali and Gatuna (8 0 km); the purchase
of maintenance equipment; consulting services anc supervision
of construction. T'he project is cofinanced by the Belgian
Government ($980,000) to cover part of the local cost of the
project.
Progress was hampered in the early stages of conLtruction by
unforeseen geotechr,ical and managerial problems. Work was
further delayed in mid-1973 when the contractor encountered
serious difficulties in obtaining fuel and cement,initially
because of interruptions to transport in neighbcuring countries
through which supplies have to transit and later because of
worldwide shortageE.  The contract is now about 20 manths
behind schedule. Detailed investigations by the supervising
consultants indicate that the technical problems, together
with the general increases in prices might cause a cost over-
run of up to $4 million. Discussions are being held with the
Government to find an appropriate solution. This may include
a reduction in the standards of the Kigali-Gatuna road.
Credit No. 2'cl-RW       Highway Mhintenance Project:   $3 million of March 21, 1973;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1976.
The project is the first phase of a highway maintenance program
designed to improve the condition of the 3,300 km national
road network and tc provide the foundation for a maintenance
organization that will be able to keep the network adequately
maintained. The project is cofinanced by the Federal Republic
of Germany ($0.5 million), which covers the foreign costs of
a central workship at Kigali, and the UNDP ($1.1 nillion) for
the provision of fc.reign technical assistance. Despite early
delays in implemencration, the project is now pro(eeding satis-
factorily.
Credit No. 435-TW        Agricultural Develcpment Project:   $3.8 million of November 29,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
The project consists of the development of food and cash crops
and livestock production through organized cropping and
ranching settlements in the Mutara region in the northeast of

paysannat comprising about 4,250 plots and ab(ot 120 group
ranches, including infrastructure consisting Of plot and
grazing area layout, road constructicn, water supply, staff
housing and cattle handling facilities. In adlditicii,
technical and marketing services are provided to project
participants; a bull-breeding ranch will be established
and the tsetse fly eradicated from the project area. A
feasibility study will be made of the complete eradication
of the tsetse fly from Rwanda.  The project, Cor which the
conditions of credit effectiveness are being fulfilled by the
Government, is die to begin in July 1974.
