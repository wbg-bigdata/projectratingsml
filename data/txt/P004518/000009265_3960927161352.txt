MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES FOR A HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of the Philippines for US$70.1 million equivalent is
submitted for approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 20 years
including five years of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest
rate and would help finance a health development project. The Government
of Italy would provide a grant of US$8.1 million equivalent and the Japan
*        Grant Facility would provide US$4.3 million equivalent to cofinance the
project.
2.          Background.  During the 1970s, the Government of the
Philippines made significant progress in improving the health and
nutrition status of the population, and some success was also achieved in
reducing fertility. However, economic stagnation and decline in the early
1980s undercut earlier progress, resulting in increased prevalence of
communicable and preventable diseases, malnutrition and sustained high
fertility. These problems were compounded by weakened health sector
in3titutions and reduced budgetary allocations to the sector. Sector
constraints include: (a) inequitable distribution of services by income
and region, as well as a trend towards an urban and curi.tive bias of
care; (b) unclear policies, procedures and lack of technical guidance for
decentralizing the health sector and providing community-level health
services, especially for underserved areas and high-risk groups; (c)
limited capacity of the Department of Health (DOH) to plan, manage,
monitor and evaluate the health sector; and (d) inadequate expenditures
and financing arrangements to meet priority health needs.
3.          The Government's Medium-Term Development Plan, updated in
July 1988, articulates a health policy which aims to: (a) expand and
improve communicable disease control, with emphasis on targeting areas
with the greatest needs; (b) strengthen decentralization of the health
network and collaboration among the DOH, local governments, private
providers of health services, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
in the development of effective community-based services; (c) strengthen
planning, management, communication and evaluation capacities of the
health sector; (d) strengthen the regulatory functions of Government and
balance public and private sector roles in the provision of curative
care; (e) expand investments in the sector and broaden the mechanisms of
financing health services; and (f) promote responsible parenthood and
strengthening of family planning. To address this broad range of needs,
the Government's strategy is to allocate an increasing share of budgetary
resources to the sector while seeking efficiency improvements, and to
emphasize improvements in preventive and primary health care in the near
term, while laying the groundwork for improvements in curative care
service delivery and financing in the longer term.
4.          The Government has already taken a number of initial steps
towards meeting its health development objectives. In 1987, a family
planning pol *.y was adopted that promotes responsible parenthood and
recognizes individual choice in controlling fertility among medically
safe methods, except for abortion. More recently, DOH has been assigned



- 2 -
responsibility as lead agency for the provision of all family planning
service delivery, including coordination with NGOs providing such
services. Budgetary allocations for DOH have been increased each year
since 1987, and the 1989 budget provides an estimated 52 increase over
1988 in real terms. A new drug policy has been adopted that is expected
to improve significantly cost eificiency in drug use and procurement. A
new health information system has been developed with assistance from the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the World
Health Organization, and DOH has revised its program budgeting and
management information systems. DOH has also developed a new community
health strategy under which (a) targeted area development programs would
focus on expanding services to areas where the health and nutrition
status is below the national average, and (b) priority impact programs
for malaria, tuberculosis, schistoscG.'Isis and maternal and child health
would address the most urgent health needs. In addition to targeting
areas and groups in greater need, both of these programs seek more
effective health outcomes and sustainability through greater community
self reliance in undertaking projects to reduce health risks to their own
communities. An essential part of this process would be increased
collaboration between DOH, local governments and NGOs. The proposed
Bank-assisted project is designed to build upon and extend the
Government's initial efforts to implement its sector development policy
and strategy, and is intended to complement assistance expected to be
provided by other donors, especially as regards maternal and child
health, and family planning services supported primarily by the United
Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and USAID.
5.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Through its involvement in
two population projects (Ln. 1035-PH and Cr. 923-PH), the Bank has played
an important role in the health sector, not only as a provider of
resources for the expansion and improvement of the Government's family
planning and health improvement programs, but also as an active
participant in the policy dialogue with the Government and other major
donors. These two projects showed the need for an increase in the number
of midwives and the enhancement of their role in outreach services and
for additional attention to the flow of funds. These issues have been
addressed in the proposed project. The proposed project would continue
to expand the policy dialogue and would serve as a vehicle for absorption
of substantial grant assistance through cofinancing.
6.          The proposed project also supports recommendations of a
recent Bank report, The Poverty Challenge in the Philippines (Report No.
7144-PH, October 1988). Among the priority areas for action identified
by the report are expansion and improved targeting of public health and
nutrition expenditures, and measures that would support maternal and
child health, fertility reduction and community-based health initiatives.
The proposed project would thus assist the Government in addressing
priority needs in its poverty alleviation efforts.
7.          Project Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed project
would be to: (a) support the Government's priorities to expand and
improve public and primary health care, especially to high risk groups;
(b) strengthen the efficiency Lnd effectiveness of DOH; (c) promote
collaboration among the Government, local governments and NGOs in meeting
community health needs; and (d) establish improved mechanisms for future



health policy development. The project would aim to achieve improvements
in the control of major communicable and endemic diseases, reduce infant
and child deaths and reduce maternal mortality and fertility. It would
also seek to promote health equity through the extension of services to
presently underserved areas and target groups by targeting high-risk
communities and individuals and stratifying services according to the
degrees of risk and/or disease density.
8.          Proiect Description.  The project would be carried out over
six years and would comprise four components: (a) four priority programs
for improvements in the control of major diseases (malaria, tuberculosis
and schistosomiasis) and in maternal and child health; ib) institutional
strengthening of DOH through improvements in management information
systems, planning and budgeting procedures, central laboratory support,
service delivery capacity, commw..cations, training and evaluation
mechanisms; (c) establishment of a program to provide grants for
organizing and implementing provincial-level collaboration among the DOH,
local governments and NGOs for community health collaboration and (d)
establishment of a national health policy council and a secretariat
within DOH and provision for studies. To carry out these activities,
drugs, pesticides, materials, vehicles, equipment, community health
grants, training and technical assistance would be financed under the
project.
9.          Total project costs are estimated to be US$108.4 million
equivalent, net of taxes and duties, with a foreign exchange component of
US$40.6 million equivalent. The Bank loan of US$70.1 million would
finance 65Z of total costs, net of taxes. A grant of USeO,1 million
equivalent would be provided by the Government of Italy to cofinance the
tuberculosis program. A grant of US$4.3 million equivalent would also be
provided by the Japan Grant Facility for project start-up, training and
technical assistance. Total external financing for the project would
amount to 76Z of total project costs, net of taxes. A breakdown of costs
and financing is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in the Philippines are given in Schedules C and
D, respectively. Maps are also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
7665-PH, dated May 25, 1989, is being distributed separately.
10.         Agreed Actions.  Prior to negotiations, the Government
selected a project coordinator.  During negotiations, the Government
provided assurances that it would issue regulations concerning: (a)
procedures for approval and distribution of grant funds within the
project, and (b) appropriate documentation of DOH's expenditures to
permit such expenditures to be eligible for reimbursements under the Bank
loan. Assurances were also received during negotiations that: (a) a
Community Health Policy Committee would be established by January 1,
1990; (b) a DOH directive would be issued by January 1, 1990,
establishing operational guidelines and procedures for a community health
fund including criteria and procedures satisfactory to the Bank ftr
selecting NGOs and other community-level organizations to receive grants
from the fund; (c) a DOH directive would be issued by March 1, 1990.
requiring provincial authorities to develop a plan to target services to
priority communities by October 30, 1990; (d) a National Council for
Health Policy Development with terms of reference agreed with the Bank



- 4 -
would be established by March 1, 1990; (e) an annual review of programs
and activities supported by the project would be carried out no later
than October of each year; and (f) annual audits, semi-annual reports and
a project completion report wodld be submitted to the Bank. A condition
of effectiveness of the loan would be the establishment of a project
coordinating unit in DOH with adequate staffing, formal appointment of a
project coordinator and designation of officers responsible for project
implementation in each implementing DOH division.
11.         Benefits.  The project would result in reduction of the
prevalence of malaria, tuberculosis and schistosomiasis in the areas of
the country identified as meeting high-risk criteria. The project would
also assist in the reduction of mortality among women and children in
high-risk communities targeted under the project, and would support
lowering of fertility through improved maternal health services. The
capacity of DOH to identify and monitor high-risk households within the
highest risk communities would be improved, which would increase both
equity and efficiency of resource use. The probability of Government
reaching the highest risk communities would be enhanced through the NGO
partnership process and this would help set the stage for broader
application to additional communities. DOH planning, management,
communication, support and evaluation capacities would also be improved
which would lead to more effective and efficient del;very of services.
Community resources would be mobilized through partnerships of local
governments and NGOs with DOH, permitting communities to meet their own
critical health needs better. Finally, the project would lay the
groundwork for future policy development.
12.         Risks.  There is a risk that communities targeted under the
project as having high disease prevalence and high maternal and child
mortality risk would be in areas of potential instability, and efforts to
reach these communities could be affected by future political
developments. Sufficient flexibility exists in the selection by DOH of
communities to be supported by the project to overcome the risk that such
developments might affect project scope, although some deserving
communities might not receive support under these circumstances. Also,
strong involvement of local NGOs in project design and preparation reduce
this risk. There is also a risk of slow implementation due to delays in
counterpart funding and to the general complexity of fund flow
procedures. These risks would be minimized through an annual review of
project performance and financial requirements by the Government and the
Bank; through the arrangements regarding the flow of project funds; and
througb the establishment of a Project Coordinating Unit and designation
of individuals responsible for monitoring and problem solving in each of
the implementing units of DOH.
13.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
