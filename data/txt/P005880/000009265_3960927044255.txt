MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PR T
OF THE INTERAT1IONAL DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLES DEMOCRTIC REUBLC OF YEMEN DR
FOR A SECOND HEALTH DEVELOPMEN PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed development
credit to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen for SDR 3.5 millioa
(US$4.5 million) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be on
standard IDA terms with 40-year maturity and would help finance a Second
Health Development Project. The proposed Project would be cofinanced on a
parallel basis by UNICEF, WHO, UNCDF and UNFPA for US$1.1 million equivalent.
The Government of PDRY would contribute the remaining US$2.3 million
equivalent of the project cost.
2.         Ercowi   The country is in the first stages of an
epidemiological transition where the health status of the population is
affected by communicable diseases, high morbidity, mortality and fertility
rates. Life expectancy at birth is 48 years and the infant mortality rate is,
140 per 1,000. The sector suffers from a lack of basic health care
facilities, insufficient health manpower and training schools, and managerial
weaknesses. Prior to 1983, the level of services was very low and only 40
percent of the population had access to basic health care. In 1983, the
Government proceeded with the implementation of a primary health care
gtrategy, and started a program which extended primary health care to 3 of the
6 governorates of the country, serving 1.5 million people. The impact of this
enhanced level of services on the population has been significant as access to
health facilities increased from 40 percent in 1983 to 64 percent today.
3.       The primary health care program was supported by the First Health
Development Project (Cr. 1377-YDR of US$7.6 million dated July 14, 1983) which
covered the three Governorates of Lahej, Abyan and Hadramawt. Implementacion
has been highly satisfactory. The project succeeded in attracting additional
financing from the Islamic Development Bank (US$5.6 million) and the Norwegian
Aid Agency (US$1.0 million), so that the combined investment supporting the
program amounted to US$17.7 million. Following this successful initiative,
the Government has decided to extend primary health care services to the three
remaining underserved Governorates of Shabwa, Al Mabra and Socotra.
4.       IDA has maintained a constructive dialogue with the Government
regarding health sector investment policies. As a major consequence of our
discussions, the Governmert has taken a commendable step in resource
allocation by setting a moratorium on iew hospital construction within the
framework of the current Five-Year Development Plan, thus underlining its
commitment to a sound primary health care strategy. Similarly, IDA's proposed
involvement in the Second Health Development Project had the catalytic effect
of attracting cofinancing from ot' er donor agencies.



-2-
5.       Rationale for lDA  vlvement. IDA supports Government's policy of
extending primary health care to underserved populations and of pursuing
institutional and manpower development. Primary health care programs have a
significant impact on health status by focusing on a limited number of health
problems that are'the greatest contributors to excess morbidity and premature
mortality and that are preventable by means of simple, relatively low-cost
interventions. MOPH needs assistance in upgrading and developing basic health
care infrastructure and services. This assistance is being provided under the
first project but now needs to be expanded for the continued success of the
primary health care strategy.
6.       Project Obectives.  The proposed project would include regional and
central health development operations and would focus on the least served
areas of the country which were not covered by the first project. These
areas, with an overall population of 400,000, have scattered communities
involved largely in agriculture, livestock holding and fishing. The Project
would have four objectives: (i) support the upgrading and extension of primary
health care in the Governorates of Shabwa, Al Mahra, and the island district
of Socotra; (ii) develop and upgrade health manpower in these areas; (iii)
promote family planning and health education in the country; and (iv)
strengthen the management capabilities of the public health sector.
7.       Project Description.  The Project would finance the repair/upgrading/
reconstruction of 26 existing health units; the construction of 19 new health
units, 3 medical stores, a regional nursing school with dormitories, and two
buildings for regional health directorates; and the provision of drugs,
medical supplies, drug information system, health education materials,
furniture, equipment and vehicles. It would also provide for in-service
training of 350 technical staff, 30 administrative health personnel, 10
maintenance staff, 500 health guide volunteers and 60 traditional birth
attendants. In addition, the proposed Project would provide 18 overseas
fellowships and 10 man-month consultant services for dev-e4oping management
skills, family planning and coamunity health information programs.
8.       The total cost of the proposed Project is estimated at US$7.9 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$3.7 million (46%). A
breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procturement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule,
are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in PDRY are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
7275-YDR, dated November 17, 1988, is being circulated separately.
9.       Actions Agreed.  A detailed list of issues and actions discussed at
negotiations are presented in the Staff Appraisal Report. The main issues and
actions agreed upon are sunmarized as follows: During negotiations, the
Government provided satisfactory evidence of the financial arrangements made
with UNICEF, WHO, UNFA and UNCDF. It also provided assurances that the
Government would (i) strengthen the project implementation unit established
under the First Health Project; (ii) establish a revolving fund by February
1989; and (iii) submit and jointly review with IDA by June 30, 1992 the



3-
findings, recommendations and follow-up action plans of the IDA-financed
studies. The Government has already submitted and !DA has approved the terms
of reference of the proposed studies.
10.      Benefits.  (i) Upgrading and developing primary health care would
reduce morbidity, mortality, and fertility rates and improve the health status
and quality of life of underserved communities representing 400,000
inhabitants or 17.4 percent of the population of PDRY. (ii) The primary
health care approach supported by the proposed Project restrains the
progressively escalating demands for the more expensive levels of health care,
thus allowing for a more efficient use of limited resources. (iii) The
proposed Project's family planning component promotes women's health and child
survival in communities where women are major participants in the rural labor
force. (iv) The proposed Project would enhance M0PH's management
capabilities and gradually reduce dependence on external assistance.
11.      Risks. No major problems are anticipated in view of the strong
performance in project implementation exhibited by M0PH staff in the rirst
Health Project. However, difficult communications within the relatively
remote and underprivileged governorates might affect project implementation
and drug delivery. To minimize these risks, the proposed Project would
adequately staff and fund regional project implementation units and establish
regional medical stores.
12.      Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
