SECOND HEA'LTH DEVELOPMENT PRO-JECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
(redit and Project Summary
Borrower:                Government of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen
Beneficiary:             Ministry of Public Health
Amov-tt:                 SDR 3.5 million (US$4.5 million)
Terms:                   Standard IDA with 40 years maturity
Proiect Obiectives
and Description:       The proposed Project constitutes a continuation of
IDA's involvement in the health sector in PDRY within
the framework of the national health development plan
and would focus on the remaining underserved areas of
the country with an overall population of 400,000 or
17.4X of the country's population. The Project would
have four major objectives: (i) support the urgrading
and extension of primary health care in the
governorates of Shabwa, Al Mahra and the island
district of Socotra; (ii) develop and upgrade health
manpower in these areas; (iii) promote family planning
and health education countrywide; and (iv) strengthen
the management capabilities of the health sector.  The
Project would finance the repair/upgrading/
reconstruction of 26 existing health units; the
construction of 19 new health units, 3 m-tdical stores,
a regional nursing school with dormitories, and two
regional health directorates; and the provision of
drugs, medical supplies, drug information system,
health educaLion materials, furniture, equipment and
vehicles. It would also provide for training of
technical and administrative health personnel,
overseas fellowships, consultant services, and for
developing community health information and education
programs.
Benefits and Risks:      The main benefits of the proposed Project would be:
(a) an improved health status and quality of life of
the target population; (b) restraining of the
progressively escalating demands for the more
expensive levels of health care and a more efficient
use of limited resources; and (c) enhancement of
4602V

MOPH's management capabilities and reduction of
dependence on external assistance. Difficult
communications within the relatively remote and
underserved governorates might affect project drug
delivery a-ad supervision. To minimize these risks,
the Project would provide regional medical stores and
locally organized training end supervision teams. No
major problems are anticipated in view of the strong
performance in project implementation exhibited by
MOPH in the First Health Project.

PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
SECOND HEALTH DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
STAFF APPRALSAL REPORT
1. SECTORAL BACKGROUND
A. Introduction
1.01     Administratively, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) is
divided into 6 governorates which are subdivided into 30 districts (Annex 1).
The country pursues a socialist system of government where the Yemeni
Socialist Party is the political authority.  The Supreme People's Council is
the legislative authority and governmental executive authority is vested in
the Council of Ministers.  At the governorate level, the Local People's
Council is the local executive authority.  In addition to Arabic wnich is
spoken throughout most of PDRY, Mahriyah and Socotriyah, both of Himyaritic
linguistic origin, are indigenous to Al-Mahra Governorate and Socotra Island.
1.02     The proposed Project appraised in th4s report constitutes a
continuation of the International Development Association's (IDA) involvement
in the health sector within the framework of the national health development
program. It would continue health development operations that were initiated
with the First Health Project in 1983. Background sectoral information is
provided in Annexes 2-5.
B. Health Policies and Objectives
1.03     The PDRY constitution states that access to medical care is the right
of each citizen and that Government guarantees this right through the
provision of free health services.
1.04     In 1979, the Government endorsed a primary health care (PHC) strategy
aiming at improving the coverage and standard of health services. The
strategy included the following priority areas: development and nationwide
application of the basic components of primary health care; expanded
immunization program; improved materna-i and child health and family planning;
strengthening the control of communicable diseai,?s, specifically malaria,
tuberculosis, trachoma and schistosomiasis; and re-orientation, training and
development of healch personnel. The development of the PHC strategy
includes: integration of -vertical programs; decentralization of health
planning, defining responsibilities of governorate and district health
authorities; organizing health services according to levels of service and
referral; extending and upgrading rural health infrastructure and resources;
and improving the quality of care and support services.



- 2 -
1.05     To underline its commitment to this sound primary health care policy,
the Government has set, in 1988, a moratorium on new hospital construction
within the framework of the Five-Year Plan (1986-1990). The decision was
taken because the cost-efficient PHC strategy was not appropriately reflected
in past investment expenditures where hospital construction was prominent. In
the early 1980's, hospital construction actually absorbed 83 percent of
investment instead of a targeted 52 percent. While hospitals are needed for
the operation of the health care delivery system, the present hospital
infrastructure would be sufficient to support the PHC network if hospitals
were well iategrated into the health care delivery system. Only t'ie
reconstruction (substitution) of Shabwa and Al-Mahra governorate hospitals is
currently foreseen to complete the basic referral network supporting the
primary health care system.
1.06     In 1984, the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) adopted the Essential
Drug Policy assisted by the World Health Organization (WHO) to rationalize
drug use and control recurrent costs. This judicious policy limited
pharmaceutical supplies to a standard list. Morbidity and consumption methods
are used ti calculate drug needs in health units and in hospitals. Drugs are
purchased by the National Drug Company through international competitive
bidding and are shipped to Aden or to Al-Muialla for Hadramawt Governorate. A
variety of standard preparations are produced by the central hospital. The
absence of marketing, advertising and private medical practice limits
overprescription and overeonsumptior.. MOPH has issued a list of drugs which
can be prescribed by each professional category and health facility. Health
guides (HG)s carry a kit with 10 essential drugs, oral rehydration salts and
ointments.
1.07     Strengthening community involvement in health promotion is emphasized
in the Third Five-Year Plan. Efforts would be continued to facilit-te
community participation in village activities such as sanitation, water
supply, nutrition, health education, collection of vital statistics and
literacy campaigns. HGs would assist in mobilizing community resources for
the support and maintenance of rural health facilities and in improving
communication with local authorities and mass organizations. MOPH plans to
issue guidelines explain, g how each mass organization can effectively support
the activities of HGs and rural health facilities. A budget line is earmarked
in the current Plan to encourage innovative approaches to strengthen
intersectoral collaboration. Pilot projects in nutrition and environmental
health at the district level are to be developed by the governorates jointly
with other ministries.
1.08     In line with current international efforts to support the WHO Global
Program on AIDS, a national committee was formed in 1987 to develop the
Short-term Plan for the prevention and control of HIV infections. As of
December 1987, there were no reported confirmed cases from PDRY.
C. Population Policies and Objectives
1.09     In 1976, the Government made a concrete step toward formulating a
national population policy through the establishment of the National Committee



on Population. The Commitcee is headed by the Minister of Planning (MOP).
Although the Government has not adopted quantitative demographic targets, the
official policy as expressed in the various development plans supports:
(a) reduction of maternal and child morbidity and mortality;
(b) decreasing fertility levels, supporting family plaaning and
population information and education;
(d) adjusting spatial distribution; and
(e)  adjusting social and economic factors including education and women's
status.
1.10     The Government has taken legislative and institutional measures to
support the status of women. The Family Law granted equal rights to men and
women with respect to matrimony, family relations and socio-economic
activities. Restrictions have been set regarding divorce and polygamy.
Currently, the Government emphasizes the integration of women into the work
force.
D. Sectoral Services
1 .11    Organization of the Minitry of Public Health. Senior authority is
vested with the Minister who is assisted by one Deputy. Seven departments are
directly attached to the Deputy Minister and consist of the Departments of
Public Health, Maintenance, ^ :-_Ficals, Finance and Administzation,
Health Planning and Statistics, Applied Research and Personnel. The
organizational structure of the Ministry is illustrated in Annex 6, Table 1.
In the regions, each of the six governorates has a Health Directorate whose
standard staffing is shown in Annex 6, Table 2.
1.12     Health Services. The organization of the primary health care
delivery network is pyramidal (Annex 6, Table 3). HGs and trained traditional
birth attendants (TBA)s act as outreach agents of the PHC system. Hgs are
literate non-remunerated volunteers selected from the local residents by the
community. HGs deliver simple messages and advice on health and sanitation,
provide first aid, dispense a few basic drugs for common ailments, and
facilitate referral of patients. In return, HGs enjoy the recognition of
their community.  There are no HGs in Shabwa and Al-Mahra.  In other
governorates, 700 HGs have been trained by MOPH, largely through the First
Health Development Project.
1.13     The first level of clinic-based PHC services rests with 342 health
units (Annex 6, Table 4) which are village-based dispensaries staffed by one
or two paramedical personnel. An unskilled worker is sometimes added Sor
ancillary tasks. The population served in the village and nearby hamlets
varies between 3,000 and 8,000 people. The health unit also supports the HGs



and the trained TBAs. Often, the clinic-based staff provide outreach services
such as vaccinations and patient visits in the community.
1.14     The next level of care is provided by 23 health centers with a total
capacity of 531 beds. Centers are located in big villages or peri-urban
areas. The targeted population per center is estimated at 15,000 persons.
Health centers provide simple in-patient care. They assist in the supervision
of their satellite health units and are the referral link between the
peripheral units and the secondary level of care, but these tasks are not
being adequately fulfilled. Health centers are usually staffed by one
physician, two or three medical assistants, two nurses, two community
midwives, practical nurses, a laboratory technician and a pharmacy technician.
1.15     In major urban centers there are polyclinics which are facilities
that fulfill the role of hospital outpatient clinics and provide services that
include all major medical specialties in an ambulatory care setting. There are
7 polyclinics in Aden and 2 in Hadramawt. The organization of referral from
polyclinics to hospitals is very satisfactory. The public health sector has
34 hospitals with 3,529 beds and 23 health centers with 531 beds. In
addition, the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, the Military, and the Police
have their own hospitals. The bed/population ratio is about 2 beds per 1,000
population which is satisfactory considering the country setting. In western
industrial market economies, the nuiber of beds per 1,000 population varies
between 5 and 11.
1.16     The total number of MOPH health personnel is 5,108 (Annex 6, Table 5)
including 647 physicians of whom 15 percent are expatriates. Of this total,
1,041 persons do not have formal qualifications in the health professions.
The ratio of population per practicing physician is 3,700. If Aden, which
contains the majority of the physicians, is excluded, the ratio falls to
7,660. The average ratio is 8,000 in lower middle-income economies, 5,000 in
middle-income economies, and 530 in industrial market economies.
E. Major Sectoral Issues
1.17     Lack of Adequate Basic Health Care. In the regions of Shabwa,
Al-Mahra and Socotra with 400,000 inhabitants (17.4 percent of the national
population), about two-thirds of existing health care facilities are in
disrepair and lack equipment, supplies, maintenance, personnel and outreach
agents. The staff morale is low and supervision is minimal. In contrast, the
Governorates of Lahej, Abyan and Hadramawt have improved primary health care
services through the First Health Development Project 1983-1988 (para. 1.28).
Existing services are poorly organized and Health Directorate staff are
dispersed in inadequate quarters loaned by local authorities and hospitals.
One health unit in Socotra and one on the satellite island of Abd Al-Kouri
with 500 inhabitants, are housed in caves.
1.18     In existing facilities, the range of services is limited and the
quality oF care needs improvement. Accessibility to health care facilities
located within one-hour walking distance is currently estimated at 66 percent



-5-
of the population in Shabwa, 55 percent in Al-Mahra, and 43 percent in Socotra
in contrast with nearly 90 percent in Aden. This lack of services demonstrate
that Al-Mahra, Shabwa, and Socotra constitute the most underserved areas of
the country.
1.19     Adequate and sustainable inmmunization coverage cannot be expected
until basic health care facilities are upgraded, increased, properly staffed,
and their outreach capacity developed. A survey undertaken in 1985 showed
that zero percent of children under one year were fully immunnzed in Al-Mahra
(A-mex 2). Also, the control of diarrheal diseases will depend on the
extenston and upgrading of the primary health care network and the diffusion
of orai rehydration techniques. Primary prevention, earlier detection and
improved patient management would contribute to improving the quality of life
of the population, to a healthier and more productive work force and to an
elderly population characterized by greater vitality rather than greater
dependency.
1. 20    Health Manpower Deficiencies.  Inadequacies in the quantity, the
quality, and the geographic distribution of health personnel affect MOPH's
ability to provide adequate heL.1th care services. About twenty percent of the
health manpower have no formal qualifications (para. 1.16). The capacity to
provide training and accommodation for nurses and midwives at the regional
level is limited and their shortages prevent the adequate provision of
maternal and child health (MCH) and family planning services.
1.21     Most of the field staff in the targeted project areas have no
in-service training. A strong hospital-based curative orientation constituted
the initial training for most. The "at risk" concept is not used in the
provision of health services. Health workers do not clearly comprehend that
they should identify individuals and families at risk of ill health requiring
special care or preventive measures and advice besides providing regular
services.
1.22     Mnaggement Related Wmsues. Overall, the administrative and
managerial capabilities of the Ministry are adequate at the central level but
are inadequate at the regional level and, excluding Aden, the short supply of
experienced senior staff affects all governorates. The majority of
physicians, nurses, administrators and other staff in charge of essential
activities are relatively young and inexperienced. All the burden of
decision-making lies with a few well-trained professionals in Aden. The
implementat%on of decentralization has also been hampered by unclear
identification of the respective roles of central and local health
authorities. Reporting and evaluation procedures are relatively informal.
Detailed job descriptions are lacking and the delegation of authority is
unclear.
1.23     The Third Five-Year Plan calls for an overall revision of the
planning cycle and the introduction of a continuous review process.
Governorate health pians are to be initiated in cooperation with local
governmental authorities and mass organizations. Centrally, MOPH would
determine national health policies and define technical norms and service



standards. MOPH is currently defining respective tasks and developing the
skills of key medical and administrative staff in health management procedures
through training and technical assistance.
1.24     Family Planning Issues. Limited -iblic education in family planning
(FP) matters results in inadequate information on birth spacing techniques and
affects both females and males. High levels of female illiteracy obstruct the
ability to disseminate FP information and education through written
materials. The capacity to design and implement a strategy of face-to-face
motivation is underdeveloped. Furthermore, the continued high rate of infant
and child mortality reduces the motivation of couples to plan births.
1.25     Outside major urban centers, access to contraceptive services and
promotive activities is limited. The shortage of female staff directly
affects the practice of FP. Trained TBAs can potentially contribute to
promoting birth spacing and FP.
1.26     The Government is planning to increase the involvement of mass
communication media and popular organizations such as the women's union,
social committees and other grass roots groups to improve knowledge and
practice of FP. Effective strategies will require enlightening community
leaders. The distribution of education materials suitable for low literacy
populations should target both males and females. Priority should be given to
training female HGs who can make an important contribution in identifying
women in need of FP advice such as women in post partum, high parity, or women
at the extremes of the reproductive age group. Contraceptive supplies should
be ensured at the community level and referral channels established.
F. Experience with Past Lending and Lessons Learned
1.27     To fulfill its primary health care strategy, the Government started
the First Health Development Project in the fall of 1983 with US$7.6 million
of IDA financing. The proposed Project focused on developing primary health
care services in the Governorates of Lahej, Abyan and Hadramawt. Additional
components, beyond the project scope, were appraised by IDA and attracted
parallel financing from the Islamic Development Bank (US$5.6 million) and from
the Norwegian Aid Agency (US$1 million). Additional support was also provided
by UNICEF and WHO (US$1 million) through their country program. The combined
investment amounted to US$17.7 million.
1.28     Project implementation has been very satisfactory.  The construction
of 55 new health units was completed. Renovation and upgrading involved 140
units. Most of the manpower development targets were achieved. In-service
training involved 580 practical nurses, medical assistants and community
midwives. About 700 HGs were trained, i.e., 200 beyond initial targets. The
management capabilities of MOPH were strengthened and supervision was
reinforced in the project areas through the organization and deployment of 21
Training and Supervision Teams. Health data collection improved. A Central



Health Education Division was established. Three medical stores were built to
facilitate effective and timely drug procurement to peripheral health
facilities. MOPH staff gained valuable experience in planning and
coordinating health services through the ongoing first project which has set
the stage for further operations which would primarily aim at developing the
district health system. The close involvement of the most senior MOPH
officials in the project cycle contributed to smooth implementation.
1.29     Three models of health unit prototypes (classified by size) were used
in the Project. During implementation it was found that the intermediate
size, designated as Type II Health Unit, was most suitable to standardize
staffing, equipment, supplies and service procedures. It provided additional
room for maternal and child health (MCH) services with minimal dead space.
MOPH has adopted this type as a standard for future health units. Also, the
availability of staff housing near the work site was found to enhance
performance and resulted in lower staff turn-over.  For the proposed secornd
project, staff accommodations would be annexed to selected health units in
areas where housing needs are acute.
1.30     During project implementation, it was found that female HGs could
provide a stronger preventive health input than their male counterparts
because women can get more involved in maternal and child health matters,
infants and children nutrition and can visit homes with a greater social
acceptance than men. In general, female HGs appeared to be more cognizant of
their role in health promotion through disease prevention and health and
nutrition education in their communities. In the future, MOPH intends to
select more females among these community volunteers. Also, MOPH is currently
planning to train HGs to administer vaccinations.
1.31     When resources are limited, using village health workers such as HGs
to provide primary health care services is one of the few choices available.
HGs would be more appropriately used as community health motivators and
educators who make use of the formal health structure for referral. At
present, PDRY is in a period of transition in which formal health services are
becoming more accessible. The long-term target is to develop high quality
services in fixed facilities and make a long lasting investment in human
resources. The target conforms with Government's efforts to improve existing
clinic-based PHC services and to upgrade the skills of their staff.
G. Rationale for IDA Involvement
1.32     The Government's policies in the health, nutrition and population
sector is consistent with IDA's strategy that focuses on: (i) extending its
prfmary health program to underserved areas; (ii) developing and upgrading
health manpower especially regional training capabilities for nursing staff;
(iii) strengthening MOPH's :-stitutional capabilities; and (iv) promoting
family planning and health education.

1.33     Primary health care programs have a significant impact on health.
They focus on a limited number of health problems that are the main
contributors to excess morbidity and premature mortality.  These problcms are
preventable through simple, relatively low-cost interventions. However, the
Government needs further technical and financial assistance to develop and
upgrade the basic peripheral health care institutions and infrastructure
necessary to expand the primary health care program to the underserved areas
of the country.
B. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
2.01     The proposed Project would include health development operations at
the national and regional levels. The least served areas of the country,
Shabwa, Al-Mahra and Socotra would be included. These arid areas have
scattered communities involved largely in agriculture, livestock holding and
fishing, with an overall population of 400,000. The targeted areas comprise
17.4 percent of the country's population and were not included in the First
Health Development Project.
2.02     The proposed Project has four major objectives:
(a) support the upgrading and extension of primary health care in the
Governorates of Shabwa, Al-Mahra, and the island district of Socotra;
(b) develop and upgrade health manpower in these areas;
(c) promote family planning and health education in the country; and
(d) strengthen the management's capabilities of the public health sector
at the central and regional levels.
B. Project Description
2.03     The proposed Project would include four components:
(a)  Developaent of Basic Health Services;
(b) Health Manpower Development;
(c) Promoting Family Planning and Health Education; and
(d) Strengthening MOPH Management Capability.
The following paragraphs provide detailed information on each of these
components:



-9-
Development of Basic Health Care Services
2.04     The propoc-4 Project would upgrade and extend both services and
infrastructure of basic health care in Shabwa, Al-Mahra and Socotra, and would
include the following:
(a) renovation/upgrading of 24 health units: 14 units in Shabwa, 5 in
Al-Mahra, and 5 in Socotra (para. 3.07a);
(b) construction of 19 new health units: II units in Shabwa (para.
3.08a), 5 in Al-Mahra, 2 in Socotra and 1 in Berim (para. 3.07a);
(c) reconstruction (substitution) of 2 health units in Al-Mahra (para.
3.07a);
(d) construction of 11 staff accommodations in selected health units in
villages with marked housing shortages (para. 3.07a);
(e) construction of a storage facility in each of the three areas (in
Ataq, Al-Ghaydah and Hadibo) for drugs and medical supplies (para.
3.07a);
Cf) provision of furniture, medical equipment and vehicles (para. 3.07b);
(g) provision of essential drugs (para. 3.07b); and
Ch) extensicn of service coverage through training of rural health
personnel, HGs and TBAs (para. 3.07c).
2.05     Upgrading and strengthening of existing health care facilities,
enhancing personnel skills, improving logistical support, strengthening
organization, and using outreach agents would enhance the impact of health
services. In addition to extensive improvement3 in PHC service quality,
access to health care facilities, located within one-hour walking distance,
would increase from 55 to 75 percent of the population in Al-Mahra, from 66 to
82 percent of the population in Shabwa, and from 43 to 53 percent of the
population in Socotra.
Health Manpower Development
2.06     The proposed Project would establish a regional nursing school in
Ataq, Shabwa, as a branch of the Health Manpower Development Institute (IHMD)
in Aden, at a site near the Health Directorate and Ataq hospital (para.
3.07a). The branch would have 3 classrooms with a capacity of 35 students in
each, and boarding capacity for 60 students. The school is designed to
provide two courses: assistant nursing and community midwifery and has
flexibility to provide other para-medical courses in the future. The duration
of both courses is two years. Initial enrollment is planned at 30 assistant
nurses and 12 midwives every year. About 55 percent of the curriculum is for
theoretical work and about 45 percent for practical work. IHMD in Aden would
provide four instructors who would be lodged at the school. The school would



- 10 -
also provide MOPH with adequate space for in-service training of other health
service personnel working in the region. It would be linked with the
Governorate Health Directorate for administrative matters and with the central
institute in Aden for curriculum and training affairs.
2.07     Providing the community with local health professionals who are
willing to pursue studies close to their homes, to remain in their own
community after graduation, and who are familiar with the socio-cultural
environment, is & priority for addressing local health problems.. Also, the
availability of a regional health institute would provide loca' women with the
opportunity to follow careers in nursing and community midwifery which is a
key factor to promote maternal and child health.
2.08     In Al-Mahra, a similar branch is needed, but cannot be built at this
time due to limited project funds (paras. 2.18-2.19). Assistant nursing
courses are already being provided in Al-Mahra with frequent disruptions, in a
temporary space borrowed from the Ministry of Education. To permit the
continuation of these courses, three new classrooms and auxiliary facilities
would be constructed under the proposed Project on a newly acquired site in
Al-Ghaydah near the Health Directorate (para. 3.07a). Boarding facilities
would be added as funds become available.
2.09     The Department of Public Health through its four divisions (PHC
Services, Hospital Services, Health Education, and Environmental and
Occupational Health) would provide in-service training and continuing
education for staff already employed emphasizing primary health care and
preventive medicine, as follows:
(a) five-day in-service courses for 128 PHC workers (para. 3.08c);
(b) two courses involving five-day training for 60 TBAs (para. 3.08d);
(c) five-day refresher courses for 500 HGs (para. 3.08c); and
(d) one-month in-service training for 10 maintenance technicians
(para. 3.07c).
(e)  two-month in-service training in midwifery and MCH for nurses and
midwives (para. 3.07c).
A list of training courses and technical assistance, including objectives,
duration and number of persons involved, is shown in Annex 7.
2.10     In addition, 200 new HG volunteers would be recruited in the three
project areas and would follow two periods of two-week training (para.
3.07c). Thirteen training and supervision teams would be organized among the
present MOPH staff to perform scheduled operational visits to supervise the
performance of PHC workers at the periphery and to provide them with technical
guidance and continuing education. The PHC Division would organize three
one-week in-service training courses to update team members on supervision and
training methodology and topics to be emphasized (para. 3.08c). The teams



- 11 -
would be directly supported by the Regional Health Directorates for their
transportation during scheduled operational visits. Each team would consist
of one medical assistant, one community midwife and one assistant health
inspector.
Promotine Family Plianin and Health Education
2.11     The PHC Division, through its MCH and Family Planning Section, would
organize in-service training in family planning for about 200 personnel from
the health units, health centers and district hospitals countrywide (para.
3.08d). The courses would include family planning information as well as
clinical skills, in particular IUD insertion.
2.12     Sixteen workshops, organized by the PHC Division, would be held in
all six governorates to raise the awareness and involvement of community
leaders and representatives of mass organizations on the benefits of family
planning for family health and development (para. 3.07c).
2.13     Five physicians and midwives from Al-Mahra, Shabwa and Socotra would
receive overseas fellowships in FP to obtain hands-on experience in advanced
family planning skills and the treatment of contraceptive complications.. On
return from training they would be a resource for further strengthening of
family planning services, as trainers at the governorate level and through
providing a referral service for complications. Also, five health
professionals would receive overseas training in FP management for six weeks.
The objective of this training is to ensure that the proposed Project areas
would obtain human resources capable of planning, monitoring and evaluating of
the family planning activities for health and demographic impact. A
contraceptive prevalence survey would be undertaken by a consultant to collect
data on contraceptive knowledge and use, which would be used as a reliable
baseline against which to measure future progress (para. 3.08d).
2.14     The proposed Project would assist the Health Education Division, at
the central level, to expand its health, nutrition and population information,
education and communication (IEC) activities by providing health education
materials, audio-visual equipment and a vehicle (para. 3.07b). This would
allow the Division to provide population information and health education
through radio and television broadcasts and through public presentations. The
Division will cooperate with the Yemeni Women's Federation and other popular
organizations on the dissemination of health education messages.
2.15     To develop expertise in communication methodologies in Shabwa,
Al-Mahra and Socotra, the Health Education Division would select one candidate
from each of these areas to pursue one-month overseas training in health
education (para. 3.08b). These officers would coordinate the implemnentation
of IEC activities in the project areas as assigned by the Division.
StrenEtheniM MOPH Mlawement Cavabilitv
2.16     To strengthen the capabilities of MOPH in planning, implementation
and evaluation of health services, and the management of pharmaceutical
supplies and health data, the proposed Project would provide for:



- 12 -
(a) the construction of a regional health directorate in Ataq for the
Governorate of Shabwa and in Al-Ghaydah for the Governorate of
Al-Mahra (para. 3.07a). The directorates would be provided with
vehicles and would act as regional project implementation units;
(b) a computerized drug information system for the Department of
Pharmaceutical and Technical Affairs to replace a smaller existing
system for inventory control at the Central Medical Stores (paras.
3.07b and 3.08b). The system would also be used by the Department of
Planning and Statistics for health data collection and processing;
(c) 5.5 man-months of consultant services to assist MOPH's senior
officials and regional health directors in enhancing their knowledge
and skills in health organization and decentralization processes
(para. 3.08b); and
(d) local training in health administration for 30 health officials from
Aden and the governorates in 2 sessions of 1 week each (para. 3.08b).
2.17     The proposed Project would finance the following studies that would
be conducted in 1990-1991 by senior staff of MOPH assisted by the Dean of the
Health Manpower Institute:
(a) an analysis of health manpower requirements (1990-2000) to facilitate
sound planning of human resources development (para. 3.07-); and
(b) an evaluation survey on the performance of HGs and PHC workers to
determine the relevance of their training, effectiveness and
incentives to increase women's recruitment to health professions
(paras. 3.07c and 3.08c). The study would determine any adjustments
needed in educational curricula and recruiting policies.
During negotiations, terms of reference of studies to be financed by IDA were
received and approved fulfilling the one condition of Board presentation.
Moreover, the terms of reference of the study to be financed by UNFPA are
being prepared and will be submitted for IDA's approval. Submission and joint
reviews of the findings, recommendations and agreed follow-up action plans
would be conducted by June 30, 1992.
I
Environmental Considerations
2.18     Provisions were made for the safe handling and disposal of
contaminated wastes at the health units. Occupational health and safety
concerns would be addressed in the health personnel training programs. No
adverse impact on the environment is expected from the civil works of the
proposed Project.
Government's Search for Extending the Project's Seope
2.19     Although MOPH is proceeding with project preparation on the basis of
cost estimates described in the following chapter (US$7.9 million with a



- 13 -
proposed IDA financing of US$4.5 million), it aimr to extend the Project's
scope to include the following additional items for whicui financing is
currently unavailable:
(a)  replacing dilapidated facilities and establishing more health units
needed in rural regions to further expand population coverage as
outlined in Government's original project proposal (41 additional
health units at a base cost of US$3.3 million); and
(b   constructing communal and boarding facilities for the Health Manpower
Institute Branch in Al-Mahra (base cost of US$1.3 million).
2.20     Our analysis supports the Government's objective to establish a
critical mass of facilities and services in the country. Because of limited
availability of project funds and the possibility of obtaining cofinancing
from other sources at a later date, the additional items described above have
been appraised (Annex 12) to assist the Government in its efforts to seek
cofinancing.

Baais of Cost Estimates
3.03     Construction costs for the proposed Project are estimatea on the
basis of unit prices derived from current contracts and on information on
construction costs in general. Costs of furniture and equipment for the
health units and nursing institute are based on current CIF prices,
transportation from the point of entry and installation costs. The estimate
of technical assistance costs is based on recent experience in PDRY for
comparable technical assistance by WHO. The man-month cost of short-term
consultants and specialists includes salaries, travel, housing, office
services, overhead and recruitment costs. Baseline costs reflect estimat'A
prices at negotiations around September 1988. Items directly imported for the
proposed Project are exempt from import duties and taxes, but locally procured
materials are estimated to include about US$0.5 million of duties and taxes.
Conti gency ARlowance
3.04     The project cost includes a contingency allowance of US$0.7 million
for unforeseen physical additions equl to 10 percent of the estimated costs
of civil works, furniture, equipment, drugs and materials, technical
assistance and training. The proposed Project also includes price
contingencies estimated at US$0.5 million for the period beginning at
negotiations (September 1988) to the end of the implementation period (Annex
9). Estimated annual price increases are indicated below:
Table 3.3: EXPECTED ANNUAL PRICE INCREASES
Calendar Year Period          1988-90        1991-2000
Foreign Costs                   3.0%           4.02
Local Costs                     3.0%           3.0%
Foreig Exchange Components
3.05     The estimated foreign exchange component of the proposed Project is
US$3.7 million equivalent or about 46 percent of the total project cost. The
estimate is based on the following assumptions:
(a) most construction materials would be imported;
(b) local architects/engineers would be employed to supervise the works;
and,
(c) all equipment, vehicles, drugs and supplies would be directly
imported.



- 17 -
The resulting foreign exchange content of each category of expenditure is
estimated as follows:
(a) civil works, 45 percent;
(b) equipment, furniture, vehicles, drugs and supplies, 90 percent;
(c) fellowships, specialist services and sZ dies, 80 percent; and,
B. Project Fmancmn
Capital Investment Costs
3.06     The proposed Credit of US$4.5 million would finance 57.7 percent of
the total cost of the proposed project, or 81.2 percent of the estimated
foreign exchange cost and 37.3 percent of the local ,ost of the proposed
project. The Government would finance 54.8 percent of the local costs
amounting to US$2.3 million or 29.1 percent of the total project cost. The
remaining cost of US$1.1 million or 12.7 percent of the total project cost
would be provided by parallel grant financing from UNICEF (US$0.2 million);
WHO (US$0.2 million); UNCDF (US$0.5 million); and UNFPA (US$0.2 million). The
proposed financial plan is summarized below:

3.07     IDA would finance:
(a)  the renovation of all 24 health units; the construction of 5 new
units in Al-Mahra, 2 in Socotra and 1 in Berim; the reconstruction of
2 units in Al-Mahra; the construction of a storage facility in each
of the three areas, 11 staff accommodations, the nursing school
branch in Shabwa, the classrooms in Al-Mahra and the Health
Directorates in Shabwa and Al-Mahra.
(b)  the provision of furniture, medical equipment, hardware for the
computerized drug information system, health education equipment and
materials, implementation supervision, drugs and vehicles; and
(c)  Family planning workshops, training of 200 new HGs, maintenance
training, midwifery and MCH training, project launch workshop, the
health manpower requirements study and the processing phase of the
PHC workers and HGs study.
3.08     UNICEF, UNCDF, WHO and UNDP are financing components that were
specifically designed for the proposed Second Health Development Project and
constitute an integral part of the Government's project proposal of March 1987.
(a)  UNCDF would contribute US$480,000 for the construction of 11 health
units in Shabwa through UNICEF as the executing agency.
(b)  WHO would finance the software and training of the drug information
system, local training in health administration, health education
fellowships, and consultant services in health planning and
management.
(c)  UNICEF would finance in-service training for PHC workers, HGs,
Training and Supervision Teams, the data collection phase of the PHC
workers study and oral rehydration salts.
(d)  UNFPA would finance the training of TBAs, in-service training and
fellowships in family planning and the contraceptive prevalence
survey.
At negotiations, the Government provided satisfactory evidence of the parallel
financial arrangements made with UNICEF, WHO, UNCDF and UNFPA.
Operating and Maintenance Costs
3.09     Incremental recurrent expenditure that would be generated by the
proposed Project at the end of the 5.5-year period when the proposed Project
becomes fully operational are estimated at YD 0.2 million (US$0.5 million).
The reason for this low increase is that, with the exception of 18 additional
nursing personnel in new health units, most of the staff required to implement
the proposed Project is already on MOPH's payroll. The yearly incremental
operating cost including supplies and salaries are estimated at US$0.3 million
while the estimated additional cost for preventive maintenance and occasional



- 19 -
repairs are estimated at about US$0.2 million every year. The total
represents a modest 1.4 percent of the projected recurrent health expenditures
in 1993.
C. Implementation
Organization and Management
3.10     The Project Implementation Unit (PIU), established in MOPH in Aden
under the First Health Development Project, would be maintained to ensure
diligent project implementation. The PIU is an integral part of the Ministry
(Annex 6, Table 1) and would play an important role in transferring experience
gained through the execution of the first and second projects to various MOPH
sections involved. The PIU would:
(a) coordinate and supervise all project activities;
(b) recruit consultants and select fellowship candidates;
(c) carry out procurement and arrange for timely withdrawals of credit
proceeds;
(d) maintain project accounts;
(e) monitor project implementation and prepare annual progress reports;
and
(f) liaise with IDA and ensure adherence to all Credit Agreement
provisions.
3.11     The PIU is headed by the Director General for Planning and Statistics
of the Ministry of Public Health. The unit has a full-time staff consisting
of the project coordinator, an architect, a qualified accountant, two
technical staff and two support personnel. At the regional level, the Public
Health Directorates concerned, reinforced by six additional secretarial and
accounting staff, would carry out project implementation. Their incremental
salaries for five years estimated at US$74,800 would be borne by the
Government. During negotiations, assurances were received that the Central
PIU would be maintained throughout the implementation period of the proposed
Project.
3.12     All sites for project facilities have been acquired by MOPH.
Architectural designs and construction drawings are identical to those used
under the first project and are considered satisfactory. Construction will be
supervised by the Ministry of Construction. Final lists of furniture,
equipment and drugs, are being prepared and will be submitted for IDA approval
by December 1988. The PHC Division would coordinate operational activit'ies
related to the organizatian of health services and to training programs and
curricula. Local training, fellowships and specialist services are estimated
at US$690,400 and their implementation timetables are listed in Annex 7.



- 20 -
3.13     To facilitate project implementation, a project launch %orkshop (PLW)
would be prepared by the Director of Planning in MOPH and would take place at
the beginning of the project implementation.  The three-day workshop would
bring together the governorate health directors and selected key staff members
from MOPH. Project objectives and implementation steps would be reviewed and
experience from the First Health Development Project would be shared. The
implementation schedule of the proposed Project is shown in Annex 9. The
anticipated closing date is June 30, 1994.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
3.14     Progress toward meeting project objectives would be monitored by
input and output indicators and by epidemiological data currently used by MOPH
and/or collected from sample data. General progress in project implementation
would be monitored by IDA missions and by annual progress reports. The PIU
Director would be responsible for preparing the annual report and its
presentation to IDA within the four months following each calendar year.
Procurement
3.15     Procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below:

- 21 -
3.16     Construction of the health manpower institute branch in Shabwa,
estimated at US$1.6 million, would be awarded through International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures according to the Bank Guidelines of May
1985. Other new construction, including health units construction averaging
about US$80,000 for each unit aggregating to US$3.1 million, would be awarded
through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to IDA. Since
the buildings are small and scattered over rural areas, foreign contractors
are unlikely to be interested in bidding on their construction. Upgrading and
rehabilitation of health units, amounting to about a total of US$0.4 million,
would be executed through Force Account by the Government, for which the
engagement of additional personnel would not be required.
3.17     Equipment, furniture, vehicles and materials, drugs and supplies,
estimated at US$1.2 million equivalent including contingencies, would be
grouped to the extent possible into contracts valued at US$50,000 or more and
will be procured through ICB except for:
(a) small items or groups of items estimated to cost less than us$50,000,
or specialized items for which ICB would be impractical, would be
purchased through LCB according to procedures acceptable to IDA.
These items would not exceed an aggregate total of US$0.2 million or
17 percent of the total estimated costs of goods, including
contingencies.
(b) equipment and furniture for the health units amounting to about
US$0.6 million and consisting of standard items from the UNIPAC
catalog, are expected to be procured from UNICEF; and
(c) readily available, off-the-shelf goods costing no more than US$10,000
would be procured through prudent shopping, based on prices quoted by
at least three suppliers. These items would not exceed a total of
US$o.1 million, or 9 percent of the total estimated cost of goods.
3.18     Consultants for IDA-financed services would be selected and appointed
in accordance with the August 1981 "Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants
by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency".
3.19     For comparing foreign and local bids under ICB, qualifying domestic
contractors, and manufacturers would be allowed a margin of preference equal to
the existing rate of customs duty applicable to competing imports or 15
percent of CIF price, whichever is lower.
3.20     IDA would review, before contract award, all draft bid documents  and
contracts for goods to be procured through ICB and all draft contracts and
qualifications of consultants. IDA would also review the draft bid documents
and contracts for the construction of the Health Manpower Institute at
Shabwa. Other contracts for goods costing the equivalent of US$50,000 or
more, would be subject to IDA review after contract award.

Disbursement
3.21     The credit of SDR 3.5 million (US$4.5 million equivalent) would be
disbursed over a period of 5.5 years. Disbursements are expected to be
completed by June 30, 1994, as projected in Annex 10. Disbursement would be
made on the basis of:
(a)  civil works:                  70 percent of total expenditures;
(b)  equipment, furniture,         (i)  100 percent of foreign expenditures
materials and drugs:          for directly imported items; (ii) 100
percent of ex-factory expenditures for
locally manufactured items; (iii) 85
percent of local expenditures for other
items procured locally;
(c)  training and specialist       100 percent of total services;
(d)  project implementation        7J percent of total expenditures
supervision:                  related to supervision travel by MOPH
staff.
3.22     The current country disbursement profile is 7.5 years.  The proposed
5.5-year implementation period takes account of the positive experience with
the First Health Project which is being implemented on schedule in 4.5 years,
but allows an extra year to account for the remoteness of some project sites.
3.23     Withdrawal applications for contracts above US$100,000 equivalent
would be fully documented. Disbursements against contracts below US$100,000
would be based on statements of expenditure. Documentation for these
expenditures need not be submitted to IDA, but would be kept in the PIU and
would be subject to review by project supervision missions and by the auditors.
3.24     To facilitate timely withdrawal of the proceeds of the credit, an
advance disbursement from the credit would be deposited in a Special Account,
opened by the Borrower and maintained in the National Bank of Yemen, from
which the proposed Project can be reimbursed for payments made to contractors,
suppliers and others to cover IDA's share of eligible expenditures. After
credit effectiveness, IDA would, upon receipt and approval of the Borrower's
withdrawal application, make an initial deposit to the Special Account in an
amount up _o US$0.4 million.  The Bank would replenish the Special Account as
requested upon receipt and approval of the borrower's withdrawal application
showing evidence that expenditures paid were eligible for financing out of the
credit. A replenishment request would normally be sent to IDA when 50 percent
of the funds have been disbursed.
Accounts and Audits
3.25     The PIU would maintain records of all project accounts and would
employ for this purpose a full time certified accountant. Project accounts
would be audited annually by the Central Board of Auditing, thereto assigned



- 23 -
by law, within six months of the end of each financial year. During
negotiations, assurances were provided that copies of the auditor's report and
the audited accounts would be submitted to IDA within nine months after the
end of each fiscal year.
3.26     The PIU would prepare a financial report each semester to be
submitted to IDA. All records of expenditures for which withdrawals were
requested from the Credit Account for works carried out by force account would
be made available to IDA's review missions for one year after the credit
closing date.
Iv. BENEF IS AND RISKS
Expected Benefits
4.01     Upgrading and developing primary health care would reduce morbidity,
mortality and fertility rates, and improve the health status and quality of
life of underserved communities. The target population which repre;ents
400,000 inhabitants or 17.4 percent of the population of PDRY, would benefit
frdm the resulting enhancement in the quality of primary health care services
and from an increased access to health care facilities.
4.02     The primary health care approach supported by the proposed Project,
restrain-l the nrngre sivelv Anealatina demands for the more expensive levels
of health care and allows a r3ore efficient use of limited resources.
4.03     The proposed Project's family planning component promotes women's
health and child survival in communities where women are major participants in
the rural labor force.
4.04     The proposed Project would enhance MOPH's management capabilities and
gradually reduce dependence on external assistance.
Risk
4.05     No major problems are anticipated in view of the strong performance
in project implementation exhibited by MOPH in the First Health Project.
However, difficult communications within the relatively remote and underserved
governorates might affect drug delivery and supervision of the proposed
Project. To minimize these risks, the proposed Project would provide regional
medical stores and locally established training and supervision teams.
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01     During negotiations, the Government agreed to the following:
(a) there would be submission and joint review by June 30th, 1992, of the
findings, recommendations and agreed follow-up action plans of



- 24 _
studies concerning health manpower requirements and health workers
evaluation (para. 2.17);
(b)  the PIU, established under the first project, woulc. be maintained
throughout the implementation period of the proposed second project
and the Regional Health Directorates would act as Regional PIUs
(para. 3.11); and
(c) the project accounts would be audited, and certified copies of
project accounts as well as an annual audit report would be submitted
to IDA within nine months after the end of each fiscal year (para.
3.25).
5.02     Subject to the above agreements, the proposed Project would
constitute a suitable basis for an IDA credit of SDR 3.5 million (US$4.5
million equivalent) to the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.

ANE  1
GENERAL COUNTRY BACKGROUND
1.01      Situated in the southvestern corner of the Arabian Peninsula, the
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY) has 5 distinct ecological zones:
the coastal plain where the majority of the population lives, the plateaus,
the valleys, tl mountain areas and the distant island of Socotra. The land
is semi-arid and rainfall is minimal. Agriculture is limited to twelve valleys
(wadis) with a total cultivable area of about 200,000 ha (less than one percent
of the country's land surface). Fisheries are a major resource. Aden oil
refinery constitutes the country's central industry. Other manufacturing
includes foodstuffs, cigarettes, textiles and leather products. The economy
remains highly dependent on remittances and on foreign aid. About a third
of the gross national product is generated by remittances and private transfers
from about 200,000 nationals employed in neighboring oil-producing countries.
Per capita income was estimated at US$420 in 1987.
1.02      PDRY pursues a socialist system of Government.  The Yemeni Socialist
Party is the political authority.  Administratively, six governorates are
divided into 30 districts.  The Supreme People's Council is the legislative
authority and Governmental executive authority is vested in the Council of
Ministers.  At the governorate level, the Local People's Council is the local
executive authority.  Several Nass Organizations such as the Yemeni Women's
Federation and the People's Defense Committees contribute to developmental
activities.
1.03      Since 1982, the pressures on the economy have been mounting and
include natural mishaps such as floods and continued dro^ught; poor agricultural
performance; declining remittan.es of migrant workers due to economic
stagnation in neighboring oil exporting countries as a result of decliijing
oil prices; reduced foreign aid; aad civil war in 1986. Facing serious
budgetary constraints, Government imposed austerity measures and the Third
Five Year Plan was revised. Hovever, with the discovery of oil in commercial
quantities in Shabwa in 1987, the economic outlook appears to be more
promising.

POPULATION. HEALTH AND NUTRITION STATUS
1.01.     Demow raDhic Characteristics.  PDRY's first national census of 1973
showed a total population of 1.6 million. The second national census was
conducted in April 1988 but official tabulations are not expected before
July, 1988. The 1987 population is estimated to be 2.3 million with a
yearly rate of natural increase of 2.7 and a growth rate of 2.5 percent.
Population is projected to exceed 3 million by the year 2000. The crude
birth rate is 44 per thousand. The crude death :ate is 17 per thousand.
The total fertility rate is 5.7 per woman. Because of high fertility, about
46 percent of PDRY's population is under the age of fifteen. The population
will double in 23 years unless the fertility rate declines.
1.02.     The population is distributed among the six governorates
approximately as follows: 31 percent in Hadramawt, a large fertile valley in
the center of the country, 19 percent in Abyan, 19 percent in Aden
(including 3 percent in Socotra), 17 percent in Lahej, 10 percent in Shabwa,
and 4 percent in Al-Mahra (Tables 1 and 2). About 33 percent of the
population is urban, 57 percent rural, and 10 percent nomadic. Nomadic
groups move in predictable cycles within well-defined tribal territories.
Similarly, urban and rural classifications do not correspond to standard
definitions. The concept of urban areas is based on the criterion of living
in an administrative capital irrespective of the size of the population and
its socio-economic organization.
1.03.     Since independence in 1967, primary school enrollment has risen
sharply from 23 to 66 percent and adult literacy programs have been
introduced. But adult illiteracy levelE are still high primarily in females
(adult literacy rate male/female: 59X/25Z). Female school enrollment has
increased substantially since independence. It has trebled for primary
education from 10 to 35 percent and doubled for secondary education from 5
to 11 percent. Variations are sharp between governorates. Female
enrollment is 44 percent in Aden in contrast with 29 percent in Mahra and
on'y 7 percent in Shabwa.
1.04.     The Status of Women.  Serious efforts have been made to remove
barriers to women's economic and social participation. Women's
participation in the formal work force has increased to about 20 percent of
the total work force and, if women's input in agricultural activities were
accounted for, the proportion would rise to 40 percent. Most formal
employment lies in jobs traditionally associated with females such as
typists, teachers, textile workers and cleaners. In Aden governorate, women
now outnumber men in the teaching profession in Unified Schools (Primary and
Intermediate). The percentage of female teachers is 79 in Aden, 36 in
Abyan, 26 in Hadramawt, 15 in Lahej, and 7 in Shabwa.
1.05.     Rural women are burdened with the consequences of water shortages
on health, sanitation and agricultural production. Drinking water is
scarce. Its availability determines where communities can settle and the

Page 2 of 3
tasks falling on women ar.d children who most often collect water for
household needs.
1.6.      Health and Sanitation.  The health status of the population is
among the lowest in the world. Life expectancy at birth is only 48 years:
46.9 years for males and 49.5 years for females. The infant mortality rate
is about 140 per thousand live births. The maternal mortality rate is
estimated to be 100 per 100,000 live births and exceeds 500 per 100,000 in
remote areas.
1.7.      Factors influencing poor health in the country include poor
hygiene, inadequate sanitation and the lack of effective health services.
The scarcity of clean drinking water and proper sanitation constitute
serious health threats primarily to children. Only 24 percent of the
country's population have access to piped water. Communications are not
satisfactory and hinder access to health care. Mahra's 89,000 inhabitants
and Socotra's 70,000 islanders have a much lower standard of living than the
rest of the population. Two years ago, Socotra received its first
electricity generation plant which serves Hadibo for a few hours each day.
There is no piped wacer on the island.
1.8.      The country is in the first stages of epidemiological transition
where the health status of the population is primarily affected by
communicable diseases, infectious and parasitic, and underlyiiig
malnutrition.  The leading causes of morbidity and mortality are gastro-
enteritis and diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections, tuberculosis,
malaria, and perinatal complications.  Among the communicable diseases of
childhood, measles and whooping cough are the two major killers with a case
fatality rate of 10 percent. Gastro-enteritis and its complications are
responsible for 24 percent of all reported infant deaths, and 17 percent of
child mortality. Intestinal parasitosis due to Giardia lamblia and
Entamoeba histolytica are highly endemic, and Hymenolepis nana infestation
is common in the rural population. Plasmodium falciparum malaria is endemic
and its highest rate of morbidity is reported from Socotra. Leprosy is
hypoendemic and there is one leprosy sanatorium-camp in Mukalla. The
morbidity pattern of leading conditions in patients seeking care in Shabwa,
Mahra and Socotra is shown in Table 3.
1.9.      An Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI) cluster survey
undertaken in August 1987 shows that 21 percent of children under one year
of age were fully immunized. These results show progress when compared with
a previous survey taken in 1985 revealing only 17 percent of fully immunized
children under one year of age in Aden and 0 percent in Mahra. The 1987
estimated coverage of children under 5 years of age was 25.7 percent in
Shabwa and 21 percent in Mahra.
1.10.     Maternal Health and Family Planning.  Pre-natal coverage is
estimated at 50 percent in Aden, 30 percent in Lahej and Hadramawt, 14
percent in Abyan, and 7 percent in Shabwa. Only 7 percent are covered by
two doses of tetanus toxoid vaccination. The percentage of post-natal
visits is 7 in Aden, 9 in Lahej, and is practically nil in Shabwa and Mahra.

1.11.     Family planning (FP) services have been available in maternal and
child health (MCH) services of the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) since
1976. Contraceptives "re sold in all pharmacies. Physicians and trained
midwives can insert intra-uterine-devices. According to MOPH's estimates,
the current national contraception prevalence rate among women of child-
bearing age is 13 percent, with corresponding rates of 31 percent in Aden
and 14 percent in Hadramawt. In contrast, Shabwa has a rate of 3 percent.
No figures are available for Mahra. The shortage of female staff is a major
obstacle to improving FP services which are provided only in 30 percent of
health facilities that are supposed to do so, and only in 18 percent of the
peripheral health units (63 out of 342 health units).
1.12.     Nutrition.  Malnutrition is P. common underlying health condition
in PDRY generally due to dietary inadequacies associated with multiple
factors, rather than to inadequate access to food. The etiologies of
malnutrition are complex and have deep ramifications with poor health
condicions. As a contributing factor, malnutrition is associated with the
leading causes of deaths in infants and children, primarily with diarrheal
disease. A 1983 nutrition survey of preschool children, sponsored by the
World Bank, studied representative parts of rural and urban areas in PDRY.
Forty percent of the children were found to be affected by malnutrition,
frequently in mild form, and 3 percent had combined forms of stunting and
wasting. Malnutrition increased in both frequency and severity with age.
Breast feeding is common after birth but declines rapidly with early
introduction of bottlefeeding, often overdiluted with unsafe water, and of
new foodstuffs in the family diet. Marasmus was seen in 3 percent of urban
children, 7.8 percent in the slums, and 6.5 percent in rural areas.
Kwashiorkor was found only occasionally indicating that overall caloric
deficiency seems more important 'han protein deficiency. Sixty percent of
the children presented were found to have anemia, with varying degrees,
largely due to dietary iron deficiency, malaria and other factors. Anemia
compromises general health, resistance to infection, cognitive development
and work performance. No vitamin D deficiency was found in the survey.
1.13.     The average caloric intake is 84 percent of the daily
requirements. An ECWA/FAO 1980 study shows that food represented 58 percent
of household expenditures. The World Food Program has assisted PDRY since
1969 and has focused on pregnant and lactating mothers and their children.
Its average yearly assistance ranges from US$1.5 million to US$2 million.
1.14.     A large proportion of adults enjoy chewing Kat leaves (Cathae
edulis) which contain psychotropic alkaloids with mild amphetamine-like
euphoric and anorectic properties. Kat alkaloids are transmitted to
breastfed infants, thus diminishing their nutritive intake. Kat consumption
constitutes an additional burden on the household budget and its purchasing
power. In its efforts to reduce Kat consumption, Government allows its
trade during the weekend only. These efforts appear to be successful in
urban areas but not as successful in the countryside. Kat is prohibited in
the governorates of Hadramawt and Mahra.

HUKAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT
1.01      The University of Aden opened its Faculty of Medicine in 1975 and
has a yearly output of 55 physicians. About 75 percet of the medical
students are females. The medical training was revised in 1987, and a nev
curriculum emphasizing community health is being adopted. The Health
Manpover Development Institute (IHMD) was founded in Aden in 1970. The
length of most courses varies between 2 and 3 years.   Statistics on courses
provided, yearly output, duration, and sex-distribution are presented in
Tables 1-4.
1.02      The minimum entrance requirement for para-medical categories
varies between 8 and 12 years of elementary schooling. An interview
precedes induction. Entrance examinations will be given beginning in 1989.
Students receive a monthly stipend of YD15 (US$45) of which YD5 are paid
back to IHHD for meals. The dropout rate is about 7 percent during the
first year and 3 percent in the second year. Currently, females constitute
35 percent of the students at the central institute in Aden, and 20 percent
in the governorate branches. The availability of adequate boarding in Aden
is a key factor to higher female recruiting.

HEALTH EXPENDITUREf
1.1.      Ca2ital Investment.  Attention to the financial requirements of
the health sector evolved in the late 1970's. when development expenditures
on health increased from YDO.4 million (US$1.2 million) in 1977 to YD7.2
million (US$21 million) in 1987 at an average growth of about 30 percent
p.a. in nominal terms (Table 1). Health expenditure constituted only 1.8
percent of the total national development expenditure during the period
1976-1980 and increased to 3.6 percent in 1981-1985. Health expenditure is
currently planned at 3.9 percent in the 1986-1990 Five-Year Development Plan
(Table 2). Foreign financing accounts for most of the capital investment in
the sector.
1.2.      Recurrent Expenditure.  Current public health expenditure is about
YD11.6 million (US$34 million) as shown in Table 3. The share of health in
Government's recurrent budget is about 6 percent which is reasonable.
Tables 4 and 5 illustrate the distribution of recurrent health expenditures
by regions and categories. Expenses on drugs represent 10 percent of MOPH
operating costs. Hospitals consume most of the operating budget, and the
central hospital of Al Gomhoria alone absorbs 10 percent (US$3.3 million) of
the recurrent budget.
1.3.      The percentage of total government expenditure cn health amounts
to 4 percent annually which is comparable to similar economies. In middle-
income and lower middle-income economies the rates are 4.4 and 3.8 percent.
Annual per capita Government expenditure on health is estimated at US$21.

ANNEX5
EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR
1.1.      Multilateral agencies such as UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA and WFP are
qtrongly involved in PDRY's health programs. Ridda Barnen (Swedish Save the
Cii.'dren Fund) provides assistance to MCH programs and to tha manpower
institute. Interagency cooperation is good. IDA's experience with these
organizations, in the field, has been positive. Inputs from various sources
are listed in Table 1.
1.2.      Arab countries and eastern bloc countries also assist the health
hector. Between 1978 and 1983, Kuwait provided US$13.5 million and Libya
provided US$14.3 million in hospital investments. Saudi Arabia is financing
the reconstruction of Al-Shaab Hospital in Aden in 1988-1989 for about
US$12.5 million (SR45 million).
1.3.      The Yemeni Council for Family Care, a quasi-NGO associated with
IPPF, assists Government with population activities such as information and
education and with contraceptive supplies. Medecins Sans Frontieres, a
French NGO, has been active since 1986 in the EPI program in Shabva, Al-
Mahra, and Socotra.
