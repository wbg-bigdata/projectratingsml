Borrower:          Republic of Turkey
Beneficiary;       Turkiye Seluloz ve Kagit Fabrikalari (SEKA)
(Turkish Pulp and Paper Enterprise)
Awountz            US$55.1 milliLon
Terms;             Seventeen years including four years of grace, at the
standard variable interest rate.
Relending Termz:  The Borrower would onlend to SEKA, under a Subsidiary
Financing Agreement, $54.8 million for a period of 15 Years
including four years of grace, at an interest rate equal to
the Bank's standard variable rate plus a nark-up of one
percentage point. SEKA would bear the foreign exchange
risk.
Proiect            The proposed project supports the Government's development
Description:       objectives to improve the efficiency of State Economic
Enterprises (SEEs), rehabilitate existing capacity in
manufacturing enterprises and explore the potential for
selective privatization of SEEs. The project would provide
for rehabilitation of the Aksu, Dalaman and Afyon mills, as
well as imported spare parts and energy saving improveMents
for all of SEKA's mills. It would furthermore strengthen
SEKA's management structure and improve operation and
maintenance nrocedures through the provision of technical
assistance to SEKA. A review of the pulp and paper
-subsector including a study of priVatization possibilities
for sELA would also be undertaken.
Benefits           The proposed project would reduce imports of newsprint and
and Risks;         short-fiber bleach pulp and increase the potential for
exporting selected grades. When fully operational, the
project would generate net foreign exchange savings of
about *29 million p.r year and reduce energy consumption.
Unquantified benefits to be derived from the technical
assistance component include improved sectoral policies and
identification of strategies for the future development of
the pulp and paper subsector encompassing both the public
and private sectors; it would also strengthen SEKA's
corporate structure and improve its operational procedures.

The estimated finacial rate of return an investmt is the
Aksu, Dalmm and Afyon mills is higher than could be
expected for investmnts in new pulp and paper projects.
Fhe main risk is that the recimmeded iiets is
SEA's unagenet and operational procedures may not be
fully realized. To increase the chances for an effective
technical and management assistance program and to avoid
delays iu its implementation, technical assistance for SEKA
would be carried out under the guidance of a committee
comprised of representatives from SEKA and consultants. A
second risk relates to the possibility of paper prices
being lower and input prices being higher than those
projected. SEEMs freedom under the law to set prices for
its products in line with market forces and the
arraugeaents proposed for wood supply should significantly
reduce this risk.

INTERNTIOL BANK FOR RCOMSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPHENT
REPORT AND REC     ION OF THE PRESID   OF TIE IBRD
TO THE mCUWIV  DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A PULP AND PAPER     BILI IO PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and reciedation     a proposed loan
to the Republic of Turkey for the equivalent of US$55.1 million to help
finance a Pulp and Paper Rehaubilitation Project. The loan would have a tern
of 17 years including 4 years of grace, with interest at the standard variable
rate. The Goverment would retain t0.3 million and would onlend to SEKA,
under a Subsidiary Financing Agreement, the balance of $54.8 million for a
period of 15 years including 4 years of grace, at an interest rate equal to
the Bank's standard variable rate plus a mark-up of one percentage point.
PART I - THE ECONOIY 1/
2.      An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entiZled "Turkey: Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report of a mission to review the financial
sector, entitled: "Turkey: Special Economic Report - Policies for the
Financial Sect-r" (No. 4459-TU), was distributed in September 1983. A Bank
mission reviei'ed the Government's Fifth Five-Year Plan (1985-89) in
August/September 1984 and its findings are reflected in this section.
3.       Turkey is about as large as France and Germany combined, with a
population of around 48 million and an estimated GNP per capita of $L230 in
1983. The density of population is low (78 per square kilometer of
agricultural land), and about 47 percent live in urban centers. Population
growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the median for middle-income
cuuntries. Despite rapid economic growth in the mid-1970s as vell as
substantial emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more recently, to the
Middle East), the employment situation has deteriorated steadily with an
unemployment rate currently estimated at about 19 percent. There is, however,
little or no absolute poverty, although income distribution is skewed. There
are considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
disparities. Recent data indicate a probable worsening in income
distribution, especially of wage and salary earners, and a sharp real decline
in average earnings. Educational enrollments have expanded greatly, but the
level of adult literacy remains relatively low.
Background
4.       During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustuents to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the consequent deterioration of its terms of external trade.
1/ Parts I and II are substantially the same as Parts I and II of the
President's Report on the Industrial Schools Project (P-3956-TU), dated
April 18, 1985.



Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by raising the
share of public investment in GDP. This was financed initially by workers'
remittances and, following the quadrupling of oil prices, increasingly by
short-term borrowings. The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as
the massive external debt burden led to a sharp deterioration in
creditworthiness severe shortages of imports, and disruptions in industrial
production with a rise in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic
inflation had also become an issue of critical importance.
5.       The Turkish authorities' response to the crisis of the late 1970s was
a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increas_d role to market forces. Policies were
adopted to expand exports and increase workers' remittances which, together
with liberalization of imports, encouragement of foreign investment and
prudent external debt management, were aimed at alleviating the balance of
payments constraint and import shortages. On the domestic front, the
objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource mobilization and better selection of investments, especially in the
public sector.
6.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
five structural adjustment loans, involves far-reaching changes in attitudes,
institutions, and the legal and policy framework, all of which require time to
put in place. Major structural changes have been made in the exchange rate
system, the export and import regimes, the tax system, interest rate and
selective credit policies and the public investment program. Implementation
of the adjustment program was carried out under a military regime during
September 1980 - November 1983 and since then by an elected government.
The Structural Adjustment Program - 1980-84
7.       The Turkish economy has show-n an impressive response to the
structural adjustment program and actual performance met or exceeded the
Government's own targets through 1982. By contrast, results in 1983 and 1984
proved to be mixed, due in part to adverse economic developments on the
external front, slippages in the monetary program, a persistent shortfall in
Government revenues and the renewal of inflationary pressures.
8.       Real GNP expanded by 4.1 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982. In
1983, GNP growth slowed down to 3.Z percent, due in large part to the effects
of a bad harvest and a decline in the contribution of the foreign balance.
The growth rate rebounded in 1984 to an estimated 5.7 percent, supported by
favorable performance in the productive sectors with agricultural value added
growing at 3.6 percent and industrial value added at 9.6 per.ent. Capacity
utilization rates in private industry in 1984 are estimated to have risen by
about 5 percent to an average rate of 72 percent. On the expenditure side,
the average annual real rate of growth of Dublic fixed investment has been
contained to 3.1 percent over the 1980-84 period while the growth rate of
private investment has improved systematically from -17.3 percent in 1980 to
4.8 percent in 1983 and an estimated 5.4 percent in 1984. Private
consumption, which had actually fallen by 5 percent in 1980, grew at
4.9 percent in 1983 and an estimated 5.0 percent in 1984. On the other hand,
helped by strict budgetary discipline, the rate of growth of public
consumption declined from 8.4 percent in 1980 to 1.8 percent in 1983.
Estimates for 1984 suggest a modest growth of 2.4 percent.



- 3 -
9.       Through 1982, the Government met with considerable success in
reducing the rate of inflation through a combination of fiscal, monetary and
incoMes policies. After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the annual average
rate of increase in the wholesale price index declined to 37 percent in 1981
and 27 percent in 1982. In 1983 the downward trend was reversed and the
inflation rate rose to 30 percent. This rise was fueled by an expansion of
Central Bank credits to firms and commercial banks in difficulty during the
second half of 1983 as well as an unexpected increase in the budget deficit.
The resulting liquidity expaDsion, in conjunction vith a lowering of nominal
deposit interest rates, encouraged consumption at the expense of savings.
10.      Inflation accelerated further in the first half of 1984, although it
moderated in the second half. The average inflation for 1984 is estinated at
a little over 50 percent. The major factors that contributed to the worsening
of the inflationary situation were the lagged impact of the expansionary
monetary policy pursued during the second half of 1983, and a significant
increase in agriculture product prices, especially of fresh fruits and
vegetables, as a consequence of export liberalization and higher export market
prices. Other important inflationary factors included substantial "catch up"
increases of SEE prices and higher import prices resulting from the noninal
depreciation of the Turkish lira. In addition, inflationary pressures etemmed
from a larger than anticipated budget deficit in 1984 as a result of a
slowdown in the growth of revenues. Given the tight monetary and fiscal
programs likely to be agreed upon with the IMF as part of a new standby
agreement (para. 25), the expectations are that inflation will decline this
year.
11.      Commercial bank interest rates, which were deregulated in July 1980,
have increased substantially and are now positive in real terms. As a result,
total bank deposits increased by 72 percent in 1980 over 1979, and in 1981
this trend accelerated, with total deposits growing by 103 percent and time
deposits by 274 percent. Growth in total deposits slowed after 1982, and in
1983 and 1984 they grew at 53 percent and 42 percent respectively. The
bankruptcy in late June 1982 of a major non-bank financial institution shook
depositor confidence and was followed by a shift of funds into the larger
banks. The Government averted an immediate crisis in the banking sector and
undertook actions to reform and strengthen the financial sector as a whole. A
new banking law was enacted in June 1983 which covered many of the
recommendations made in the Bank's report on the Financial Sector
(No. 4459-TU). These in-luded measures to reduce the undercapitalization of
banks, place limits on the real assets and investments of banks, link the
establishment of branches to the level of a bank's equity, reduce the
interlocking between banks and corporations, introduce a deposit insurance
scheme, and increase the role of the Central Bank in the supervision of the
banking sector. A new law is currently before Parliament which will further
the banking reform process by introducing standardized accounting for banks
and improved procedures for handling non-performing loans. The Government
also took a major step towards reducing the cost of intermediation by reducing
the financial transactions tax from 15 percent to 3 percent. Separately, the
Government has reduced the level of withholding tax applicable to interest
payments on deposits and bonds from 20 percent to 10 percent. Other important
developments in the financial sector include measures undertaken to revitalize
the capital markets, for which IFC has provided technical assistance, and the
sale of revenue-sharing certificates linked to the income from selected public
facilities (e.g. the Bosphorus bridge).



12.      The Government is comnitted to maintaining an interest rate structure
for deposits which is positive in real terms. Time deposits have been
yielding more or less positive real returns since end-1983, with interest
rates ranging from 45 to 53 percent depending upon the term of the deposit.
While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to save, they
have also meant high borrowing costs. Nominal interest rates range from 60 to
80 percent on non-preferential credits, in part because of the high
intermediation costs of the commercial banks and their widely prevalent
practice of requiring compensating balances. The interest rate differentials
between preferential and non-preferential credits and among preferential
credits are large and need to be reduced. The Government has reaffirmed its
determination to achieve positive real rates on all lending by a combination
of bringing down inflation and phasing out interest rate subsidies on
preferential credits. In January 1985, it eliminated preferential interest
rates on short-term export credits. High market interest rates, together with
the limited availability of credit, have led to considerable liquidity
problem for the private business sector, particularly for businesses
supplying the domestic market. Measures are also needed to lower the
operating costs of banks, which are well above prevailing levels in comparable
countries.
13.      In the fiscal area, progress was evident from 1980 to 1982 but there
have been slippages in 1983 and 1984. The budget deficit to GNP ratio was
reduced from 5.3 percent in 1980 to 2.1 percent in 1982, and the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) dropped sharply from 12.6 percent of GNP to
6.9 percent over the same period. However, the revenue to GNP ratio has been
declining over the past three years. From a high of 20.3 percent in 1981, it
has fallen sharply to an estimated 15.6 percent in 1984. Largely because of
this significant shortfall in revenues, overall fiscal performance has
worsened since 1983 even though government expenditures have been considerably
curtailed (from 24.2 percent of GNP in 1980 to an estimated 20.8 percent in
1984) and budgetary transfers to SEEs as a percentage of GNP have fallen
steadily (from 4.8 percent in 1980 to an estimated 1.6 percent in 1984). The
budget deficit is estimated at 5.2 percent of GNP in 1984 and the PSBR at
8.8 percent. The downward trend in the Government revenue to GNP ratio
highlights the urgency of mobilizing additional public resources. As a step
in this direction, the Government introduced a Value Added Tax (VAT) in
January 1985.
14.      Improvements in the balance of payments were systematic through 1982
with the current account deficit decreasing from $3.3 billion (5.7 percent of
GNP) in 1980 to $1.2 billion (2.2 percent of GNP) in 1982.  However, in 1983
the current account deficit widened to about $2.1 billion (4.2 percent of GNP)
as merchandise exports and workers' remittances fell short of targets.
Exports rebounded strongly-in 1984, growing by 25 percent in dollar terms to
$7.1 billion. Remittances, too, registered a higher than expected increase,
reaching $1.9 billion (up by 24 percent). Concurrently, there was a continued
large inflow of deposits through the Dresdner scheme ($550 million in 1984).
Under this scheme the Dresdner Bank collects deposits from Turkish workers in
Germany and automatically places these funds at the disposition of the Central
Bank of Turkey, which guarantees the deposits and pays an interest rate
commensurate with the Euro-market rate. However, these increases were offset
by a sharp rise in merchandise imports to $10.8 billion (up by 16 percent in
dollar terms). As a result, the current account deficit in 1984 was
considerably higher than projected, reaching $2.1 billion (4.3 percent of
GNP), or about the same level as in 1983.



15.      On balance, merchandise export performance has been impressive over
the 1980-84 period, growing at an average annual rate of about 26 percent in
dollar terms. This growth has been led by the manufacturing sector and has
involved a rise in the share of exports to the Middle Eastern countries.
Industrial exports, comprised primarily of processed foods and textiles, have
risen from 36 percent of total exports in 1980 to 72 percent in 1984. These
results were achieved by a combination of indirect (flexible exchange rate
policy and import liberalization) and direct (tax rebate., preferential
credits) measures to enhance the relative profitability of exports and offset
the traditional bias towards producing for the domestic market. The flexible
exchange rate policy was one of the most important factors contributing to the
growth of exports, together with the penetration of Turkish products in Middle
East markets.
16.      On the import side, the 1982-83 period was marked by a relative
stability in the growth of merchandise imports, mostly due to exogenous
factors. Imports fell by 1.0 percent in dollar terms in 1982 and rose by only
4.4 percent in 1983.  This reflected price decrease3 in both oil and non-oil
imports. Merchandise imports, however, increased substantially in value in
1984. The increase has been most significant in some of the groups (e.g. raw
materials and consumer goods) that have been subjected to major liberalization
in terms of both a lowering of tariff rates and a significant removal of
quantitative restrictions.
Mediumr-Term Prospects
17.      The Governument's Fifth Five Year Plan (1985-89) was approved by the
Grand National Assembly in July 1984. The Plan reaffirms the Government's
determination to pursue an outward-oriented development strategy and to
liberalize the economy by relying increasingly on market forces for allocation
decisions. The public sector is targeted to play a supportive role by
concentrating its investments in infrastructuxe rather than manufacturing,
while the private sector is to be encouraged to play a leading role in the
growth of manufacturing and exports. Some of the key targets are:
{i)   an average annual GNP growth rate of 6.3 percent;
(ii)   an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise exports of
10.6 percent;
(iii)   an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise imports of
8.2 percent;
(iv)   an average annual real rate of growth of 10.9 percent in private
investment and 6.8 percent in public investment; and
(v)   a declining external debt service ratio, from 26 percent in 1984
to around 18 percent in 1989.



-6-
18.          While  the  overall  thrust of the  Plan  is  in  accord  with  the  goals of
the structural adjustment program, certain targets seem optimistic in view of
both past performance and the iuzediate prospects for the economy. The Bank's
projections indicate the need for a continuation of the stabilization program
well into 1987, implying a lower growth rate in GDP for the early years of the
Plan and a return to a higher growth path only in 1988. Key economic
variables in the Bank's latest projections for the period 1985-89 are
presented in Table 1:

19.      Bank projections indicate a GDP growth of 5.6 percent per annum on
average for the Plan period, with a low of 4.9 percent in the initial year of
the Plan (stabilization period) and a high of 6.3 percent for the final year
(growth period). Achievement of these growth rates will depend on the
performance of the productive sectors, namely agriculture and manufacturing.
This in turn will depend to a large extent on the Government's determination
to constrain the growth of the public sector in line with public resources and
to create a more favorable investment climate for the private sector. This
translates itself into a projected real growth per annum in public fixed
investment of about 5.0 percent on average for the Plan period, starting with
a modest increase in the early years. The comnarable figure for private fixed
investment is 10.6 percent or a ;ittle more than twice the growth rate for
public fixed investment. These figures are consistent with the need to meet
the infrastructure requirements of the economy through the public investment
program, while providing for the capacity expansion of the private sector
necessary to meet the export and growth targets.
20.      Merchandise exports are projected to grow at an average 9.4 percent
per annum in real terms. Merchandise imports, on the other hand, are
projected to grow more slowly in real terms through 1986 and then pick up to
an average 7.5 percent per annum in the terminal years of the Plan. On these
assumptions, the current account deficit is projected to decrease through 1986
as stabilization policies act to contain import growth while encouraging
exports. As higher growth rates set in during the middle of the Plan period,
the trend would reverse and the current account deficit would rise moderately
through the end of the Plan. The terminal year 1989 would show a deficit of
approximately $2.0 billion as compared to a 1985 figure of $1.7 billion. The
projected capital account is seen to remain manageable throughout the period
even in the face of some sharp increases in the amortization payments in
1985-87 arising fron. the debts rescheduled during the 1978-80 period and an
imposed constraint on foreign exchange reserves equivalent to at least two
monchs' imports. Consistent with the above is an average debt service ratio
for medium and long-term credits for the Plan period of 21.7 percent.
Including short-term debt the average debt service ratio for the Plan period
is 23.7 percent. Gross capital inflows required in 1989, on these
assumptions, would be about $5.9 billion, or about 38 percent higher than the
amount in 1984. Such an inflow is consistent with a decreasing debt service
ratio from 1986 onwards.
21.      The medium-term scenario presented above is, of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used specifically to illustrate Turkey's potential
in the light of the Government's own development strategy. Given Turkey's
progress in the structural adjustment program, rae favorable response which
this has evoked from the international financial coummunity and the present
view of future resources and export market possibilities, the Government's
somewhat more ambitious Plan targets would be feasible provided they are
supported by slightly higher export growth rates and greater success in the
mobilization of public resources. This may be more difficult to achieve in
the early (stabilization) pt-Ie of the Plan.
22.      In view of the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions of
export and import growth ra -, a downside risk case has also been developed.
With Turkey's export performance heavily dependent on exogenous factors such



as the world economic outlook and moveaents in international prices, a slover
growth of merchandise exports (an average of 6.9 percent over the Plan period)
would lead to a more difficult but still manageable balance of payments
situation, more external borrowing, a lover GDP growth (averaging about
4_8 percent per annum) and a higher debt service ratio (22-24 percent per
annum). In such a situation the Government would have little chance of
absorbing the umemployed and improving tangibly the average standard of
living. However, given the Government's emphasis on export promotion and the
determined efforts to counter the bias towards producing for the domestic
market, there is good reason to support the perspective set out in the
mediumrterm scenario presented in paragraphs 18 to 21.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
23.     At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.2 billion in short-term debt and
$7-0 billion in medium and long-term debt. Between 1978 and 1980, Turkey
rescheduled some $9.2 willion of outstanding obligations through a series of
rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors.
Approxaimately $6.0 billion of short-term debt, including $2.6 billion in
cowertible Turkish lira deposits and bankers' credits and $1.2 billion of
non-guaranteed suppliers' credits, were consolidated into medium-tern loans or
partially converted into Turkish lira obligations. Following the resolution
of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from official sources - major
creditors being the OECD countries, the World Bank and the IMF. Of the
estimated total debt outstanding of $22.7 billion at end-1984, 81 percenr
constituted medium and long-term debt (including IF). Short-term debt as a
percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to about
11 percent in 1982, then increased to 14 percent in 1983 and to an estimated
18 percent in 1984. Much of this growth in the stock of short-term debt is
due to the inflows associated with the Dresdner Bank scheme (para. 14). At
end-1984 the outstanding liabilities associated with the Dresdner scheme are
estimated to amount to $1.8 billion, which would represent about 45 percent of
Turkey's short-term external obligations and 8 percent of its total
outstanding debt. Based on the growth scenario outlined earlie., debt
outstanding and disbursed as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall from an
estimated 41 percent in 1984 to 32 percent in 1989. This translates into a
total debt outstandiug forecast for 1989 of $30.6 billion, with short-term
debt constituting about 23 percent of that total. Dresdner scheme inflows are
projected to be around $600 milliou per annmu  throughout this period and to
account for a large part of the rise in the ratio of short-term debt to total
debt outstanding.
24.     The debt service ratio for medium and long-term credits (in relation
to exports of goods and non-factor services and workers' remittances)
increased from about 14.6 percent in 1981 to a peak of 28 percent in 1983 as a
result of a large repayment of previously rescheduled debt under the earlier
OECD agreements. Debt service obligations are likely to be high over the
coming years and would average about $3.8 billion per year in 1985-89.
However, the debt service ratio is seen to decrease from an estimated
25 percent in 1984 to 19.8 percent in 1989. The debt burden should remain
manageable provided current policies are successfully implemented, the export
drive is sustained, and Turkey continues to receive further support from
international commercial and official sources. There have been encouraging



-9-
signs of Turkey's ability to enter the market for comerial borrowings. From
December 1983 to November 1984, Turkey had secured a little over $500 million
from coaercial credits, contituting about 23 percent of the total external
credits received during this period. The Central Bank of Turkey recently
completed the syndication of a $500 million uulti-component medium-term (seven
years) facility iuvolving a large number of U.S., European, Japanese and
Middle Eastern commercial banks as lead managers.
25.      Turkey's economic program has been supported by the IF through a
series of standby arraugmients. A three-year standby arranmet in an amount
equivalent to SDR 1250 million ma approved by the IMF's Board and became
effective on June 18, 1980. The Government purchased the full amount
authorized under the arra    ent. The Government also purchased
three-quarters of a SDL 225 million one-year standby arrangement Which was
approved by the WT in April 1984 and replaced an earlier one-year arrangement
terminated at the request of the Government. Discussions are presently under
way on a further one-year st.ndby arrangevent.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TUnEY
26.      Through March 31, 1985 the Bank and IDA have lent $5383.5 million 1/
to Turkey, through 81 projects. Agriculture accounts for 19 percent of funds
lent, industry and DFCs for 24 percent, pover for 13 percent, structural
adjustment and program loans for 32 percent, and urban development,
transportation, education, touri-m and technical assistance for the remaining
12 percent. Disbursements f. all sectors combined (excluding structural
adjustment loans) average 49 percent of appraisal estimtes, as compared to
50 percent for Tunisia and 49 percent for Morocco. As of March 31, 1985, IFC
couitments to Turkey totalled about $239 million, of which .aout $64 million
were still held by IFC. Annex II provides a suumary statement of Bank loanr,
IDA cre4its and IrC investments as of March 31, 1985.
27.      Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The main vehicle for the
Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structural
adjustment lending (SAL) program. SAL V, which was approved in June 1984,
completed the series of five loans which the Bank had indicated would be the
maximum to a country. Significant progress has been achieved in the past five
years, but the task of restructuring is by no means over. The next phase will
involve the broadening and deepening of the adjustment process at the sectoral
level. Recent economic developments have underlined the need for a
continuation of the stabilization program without giving up the goals of
1/ Net of cancellations.



- 10 -
sectoral adjustment. Hence the emphasis of Bank lending in the post-SAL
period would be on striking an appropriate balance between sectoral adjustment
leading designed to be quick disbursing and supportive of policy reforms in
the major sectors, and carefully formulated project lending focussing on high
priority projects principally in the agriculture, energy and transport sectors.
28.      Efforts have already been initiated to develop a series of sectoral
adjustment loans for the major sectors over the next few years, starting with
agriculture. The loans for the agriculture sector would help to support a
wedium-term action program aimed at increasing the growth of primary
production and exports, rationalizing public investment and strengthening
sectoral institutions. Sectoral adjustment lending would also support
measures to address the structural problems of the financial sector and
enhance the utilization of industrial capacity in the public and private
sectors, keeping in view the scope for the "privarization" of publie!ly-held
assets in the manufacturing subsectors. Other sectors Where sectoral
adjustment leans could be developed include energy and transport.
29.      Project lending, which will continue to make up the majority of the
lending operations, will be designed to support and strengthen the adjustmet
process. A portion of project leading would be earmarked for the construction
or rehabilitation of key projects in the energy sector. Other projects would
be guided by the major policy objectives of the Government, which include
generation of foreign exchange (including improving productivity in export
industries and providing essential infrastructure for exports), improvement of
institutional efficiency, non-inflationary output growtY. and amelioration of
the social costs of adjustment (including provision of social infrastructure
and employment generation, with some emphasis on the least developed provinces
in Eastern Turkey).
30.      The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and sector
work currently being undertaken includes a review of the five-year development
plan and studies of housing finance, teleconnunications and electronics.
Topics to be covered in the future include a review of the public investment
program, a study focussing on the impact of structural adjustment, a review of
transport investments and studies of engineering and agro-industries.
31.      In addition to this loan to Turkey, other projects being presented to
the Executive Directors this fiscal year include an -.ngineering loan for urban
development, an agricultural sector adjustment loan, and loans for a fourth
power transmission project, a power system operations assistance project,
industrial schools project and a ports project.
32.      Turkey's debt burden is projected to remain manageable throughout
1985-89 (paras. 23 and 24). The Bank Group's share of Turkey's total external
debt was 12.4 perceut in 1983, is estimated at 13 percent in 1984, and is
expected to grow to about 17 percent by 1989. Official debt outstanding is
projected to increase from $11.4 billion in 1984 to $14.4 billion in 1989 and
private medium and long-term debt outstanding is projected to increase from
$5.7 billion in 1984 to $8.8 billion in 1989. The Bank group's share of total
debt service payments is projected to increase from about 12 percent in 1983
to an estimated 13 percent in 1984, and to about 17 percent in 1989.

33.     IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings, food processing and tourism. It has also invested in
the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms. In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistanrce to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory frameork for leasing.
PART II - THE SECTORAL FRMWiORK
The Industrial Sector
34.      The central objective of Thrsey's developmnt strategy till the late
1970s was rapid growth through industrialization and modernization of
agriculture, with special emphasis on import-substitution and
capital-intensive technology. While the private sector was provided with
considerable protection and generous incentives, a major role was assumed by
the public sector. Through the State Economic Enterprises (SEKs), the public
sector provided the necessary infrastructure and basic industries as a
pre-condition for growth.
35.      This str-.tegy produced significant modernization of the industrial
sector. The pattern of growth, however, was inappropriate for Turkey's
resource base and its interaational comparative advantage. The new
development strategy adopted in 1980 entailed moving industry towards outward
orientatioa and giving an increased role to market forces, with greater
emphasis on the private sector to stimulate growth, exports and employment.
The main industrial policy objectives of the Government's program are to
improve public and private sector efficiency, focus public investment in
manufacturing on rehabilitation of existing capacity, promote exports by
developing industries in which Turkey possesses a comparative advantage, and
explore possibilities for the selective "privatization" of SEEs.
36.      The share of industry in Turkey's economy has grown rapidly and in
1983 accounted for 32 perceat of GDP, 30) percent of fixed investment,
10 percent of aggregate employment and 65 percent of total merchandise
exports, which were mainly from the private sector. heavy industries
(i-luding petroleum refining and basic metals, steel, fertilizers, pulp and
p,a -r, cement, coal, sugar, machinery and chemicals) are concentrated in about
twenty manufacturing SEEs in the public sector.
The Pulp and Paper Subsector
37.      Over the last 25 years, the public and private sectors of the pulp
and paper industry have evolved with differences in grade mix, raw material
requirements and the degree of vertical integration. Turkey's first paper
mill was established in 1934 in the public sector by the SEE, Sumerbank.
Responsibility for this plant and all public sector participation in the pulp
and paper industry was later transferred to Turkiye Seluloz ye Kagit
Fabrikalari (SEKA)  which was formed in 1955.  Since Turkey remined a
substantial importer of paper products, particularly newsprint, the Government
undertook a series of integrated pulp and paper mill investments starting in



- 12 -
the early 1970s. At the end of 1984, SEKA had eight pulp and paper mills in
operation, seven of which have an average installed capacity of close to
90,000 tpy, and which account for some two thirds of the country's total
output of paper and paperboard. SEKA is the sole domestic producer of
newsprint and sack paper. Since 1970, the private sector has expanded its
operations and now accounts for about one third of the country's production.
There are 36 mills in the private sector with an average capacity of 5,000
tpy, although five mills are of moderate size (20,000 tpy). The private pulp
and paper sector is based primarily on waste paper, straw and some imported
pulp, and mainly produces hygienic paper, wrapping paper and paperboard.
38.      In 1983, the pulp and paper industry's share of industrial output was
around 2.5 percent of the total, with its 16,000 workers accounting for two                    d
percent of total industrial employment. Over the last decade, the industry
has made significant progress towards attaining a high degree of
self-sufficiency for Turkey in the production of paper and paperboard. By
1983, domestic production of 568,000 tons accounted for more than 90 percent
of consumption. Altbough newsprint and sack kraft have been imported in
varying quantities over the past few years, such imports are expected to
diminish as production in the recently commissioned Akdeniz and Balikesir
mills increases. There has recently been some measure of success in exporting
hygienic paper and coated boards to neighboring countries, amounting to about
five percent of total domestic paper production in 1983.
39.      Wood is the most important fibrous raw material utilized by the
public sector, supporting about 80 percent of SEKA's pulp production. In 1983
about 53 percent of Turkey's paper production came from wood, 28 percent from
waste paper, 10 percent from straw and reeds, and the balance of 9 percent
from imported pulp. Turkey has extensive natural forests in the mountainous
areas of the Black Sea, Marmara, Aegean and Mediterranean regions, virtually
all vested in the state. Total roundwood production over the past five years
has averaged 7.5 million u3/year or about 0.4 m3/hectare. By comparison,
wood production in Scandinavia is about 1.5 m3/hectare. Efforts to increase
industrial roundwood production and improve forestry management practices are
being addressed under the Northern Forestry Project (Loan 1585-TU).
40.      SEKA's wood purchases over the past four years have varied from 1.0
to 1.5 million m3/year, or the equivalent of between 12 to 21 percent of
total industrial roundwood production. The additional volume of coniferous
wood required for the Aksu mill as a result of the proposed project can easily
be met within the current level of wood production. The availability of logs
for SEKA is therefore reasonably secure. However, a number of related
problems have been identified, including delays in wood delivery due to
bottlenecks in log harvesting and delivery arrangements. The technical
assist rce program under the proposed project would examine these issues and
make recommendations on institutional and technical measures to improve wood
utilization, including the possibility of SEKA and other wood-using entities
directly undertaking forest management and wood production.
4L.      Domestic consumption of paper and paperboard products grew at a
relatively steady rate of 6.6 percent per year between 1970 and 1982. About
one quarter of all paper and paperboard currently consumed in Turkey is
newsprint. With the completion of two new mills in 1981 and 1984, imports



- 13 -
(mainly newsprint and specialty papers) have dropped to previous levesa. The
Fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1985-89) estisates that domestic demand for
paper and paperboard products would grow by an average of 5.3 percent per
annum. The demand for packaging paper and paperboard products, which are
critically needed for the export drive, is projected to grow by 10.1 percent
per year over the Plan period. Even with the increase in newsprint production
which would result from the proposed project, only 80 percent of domestic
demand for newsprint is expected to be met by 1990. In contrast, there is
potential to increase exports of sack kraft and linerboard through efficiency
improvements in SEKA's operations.
42.      Under the import liberalization program, significant changes were
made in the trade regime for pulp and paper in January 1984 including, for
example, the relaxation of controls over the importation of paper and paper
products and a substantial reduction in nominal tariff rates. Furthermore,
since the passage of the SEE Reform Law in October 1983, the Government has
encouraged SEEs, including SEKA, to exercise their freedom to set prices
accordiug to market conditions. As a result, in 1984, SEKA's selling prices
for printing and writing paper, newsprint and sack kraft have been increased
substantially and are in line with import parity prices but below the general
landed cost after applicable duty and levies.
The Borrower
43.      SEKA was established in 1955 as the SEE responsible for public sector
operations in pulp and paper. Each of SEKA's eight mills and the Bolu
fiberboard plant are separate legal entities incorporated as companies under
Turkish law. However, autonomy is limited to general and routine operational
matters, and in practice, they operate as divisions of SEKA. SEKA's
authorized capital is fully held by the Government. Under the SEE Decree of
June 1984, SEKA reports directly to a State Minister in the Office of the
Prime Ministry responsible for the manufacturing SEEs. SEKA's Board of
Directors is appointed by the Government for three-year terms and concentrates
on policy issues leaving executive powers to the Chairman, who is also General
Director. Each mill has a management committee to take decisions regarding
mill management in accordance with operating targets, plans and budgets. SEKA
has benefitted from less frequent changes in senior management as compared to
the past. There has also been a trend towards decentralization of decision
making with mill managers being held more accountable for operational
performance. Overstaffing has been a major problem confronting SEKA's
management. SEKA has taken specific measures to address this issue, including
freezing the number of job positions at the November 1980 level, cancelling 50
percent of job positions becoming vacant through resignation, retirement or
death, and allocating priority to staffing new mills from existing manpower.
As a result, between 1980 and 1983 some 1,382 positions or 10 percent of total
job positions in SEKA were eliminated. In spite of these significant
improvements, SEKA's manpower efficiency is low in comparison to major pulp
and paper producing countries. Further improvements in labor productivity are
expected to follow from the proposed project.
44.      SEKA's capacity utilization of about 75 percent in 1983 is low in
comparison with similar mills in North America and Scandinavia where capacity
utilization of at least 90 percent is normal. The major factors which



- 14 -
affected SEKA's performance in the past include price controls, low
operational efficiency, frequent changes in management and difficulties in
attracting and retaining high caliber staff.  1., addition to liberalization of
prices, the SEE Reform Law provides for greater delegation of powers to Boards
of Directors, including the power to appoint Assistant Director Generals and
other high level managers (appointments of Assistant General Managers were
pi-.viously made by the Council of Ministers on the proposal of the Minister
concerned). Employees of SEEs are also to be governed by a new personnel
regime to be announced in the near future, whicE. is expected to give greater
flexibility to SEE managements in determining wages and salaries.
Improvements in SEKA's operational procedures and strengthening of its
management structure would be a major aim of the technical assistance program
to SEKA under the proposed project.
45.      SEKA's financial performance deteriorated fros 1977 to 1983 primarily
because of inadequate pricing policies. By the end of 1983, SEKA had
accumilated losses in excess of IL 30,000 miLlion and had a current ratio of
0.58. As part of its SEE reform efforts, the Government drew up a financial
assistance plan in 1983 for SEKA which provided for TL 12,000 million of new
equity through various measures, along with provision for revaluation of
assets. In addition, in 1984 approximately TL 39,000 million (about $121
million equivalent) of SEKA's debts were consolidated and converted to equity
capital. Following the reaffirmation of the Government's policy of allowing
SEEs to set prices for all their products in the light of market conditions,
SEKA increased its prices by about 40 percent across the board in two steps
during the first four months of 1984. It is SEKA`s intention to continue to
set prices at levels which do not depend on protection measures and are not
increased unduly to cover high costs caused by inefficient operations.
Approach to Privatization
46.      As part of its development strategy, the Government is exploring
opport:inities for the selective privatization of SEEs and is considering
various alternatives including divestiture, sale of shares to the public,
leasing and management contracts. The Government has identified the pulp and
paper subsector as a possible candidate for privatization. A component of the
technical assistance program under the proposed project would review the
possibilities for privatization of some of SEKA's facilities. The Government
has indicated that selective privatization could be pursued even in advance of
completion of the proposed subsector study. SEKA has thus recommended to the
High Economic Council that, as a first step, the Bolu fiberboard plant be
considered as a suitable candidate for privatization.
Bank Participation in the Subsector
47.      Bank participation in the subsector began in 1974 with a loan to the
Government of $40 million for the Antalya Forest Utilization Project
(Loan 95.-TU), of which g35.5 million was onlent to SEKA for the Akdeniz
integrated pulp and paper and saw mills and the remaining $4.5 million was for
modernization of forestry operations. The loan was closed in 1982. There
were delays in the implementation of the Akdeniz component, primarily due to
initial changes in the site location. The mill was commissioned in early 1984
and is now exceeding the production rates estimated at the time of appraisal.



- 15 -
The Bank also provided a loan of $70 million to SEKA for the Balikesir
Newsprint Project (Loan 1258-TU), which was signed in 1976 and closed in
1982. The Project Completion Report dated June 1984 noted that implementation
was delayed on account of a shortage of materials and domestic financing
during a period of general economic crisis in Turkey. The facilities were
commissioned in 1981, and after initial technical difficulties, production
performance is currently at 80 percent of design capacity which is close to
appraisal estimates. The experience gained from these projects has been taken
into account in the design of the proposed project, which includes a
comprehensive technical assistance program aimed at strengthening SEKA's
management structure and improving its operational procedures. The Bank also
made an $86 million loan for the Northern Forestry Project (Loan 1585-TU)
signed in 1978 and still under implementation.  The project seeks to increase
industrial roundwood production and improve the Government's forest management
planning and operations.
48.      In addition to these direct loans, about $7 million in proceeds from
the State Investment Bank (DYB) I and DYB II Projects (Loans 1024-TU and
1379-TU) were utilized to finance investments designed to balance production
facilities at the Dalaman and Caycuma mills, and $20 million for construction
of the Akdeniz mill. The Project Completion Report of February 10, 1984 for
DYB I (Loan 1024-TU) and the Bank report entitled, "Sector Operations Rewiew:
The Industries and DFCs Program in Turkey"' (No. 3077), dated July 18, 1980
concluded that a major lesson from the Bank's experience with DYB is that
improvements in SEE performance can be better achieved through direct loans
and industrial sector policy dialogue. Both of these recommendations have
been taken into account in designing the proposed project. Through the
Export-Oriented Industries Project (Loan 2093-TU). the Bank is also indirectly
involved in the expansion of Kartonsan, a private sector company which
produces coated board. IFC has been actively involved in the private sector
and currently holds equity in Viking Pulp & Paper Company, one of the largest
private sector mills producing about 12,000 tpy of wrapping paper.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
49.      The proposed project was identified during a June 1980 mission and
preparation was financed under a $560,000 advance from the Project Preparation
Facility (PPF). Project appraisal was complered in May 1984. Loan
negotiations took place in Washington, D.C. from March 12 to March 18, 1985
with a Turkish delegation headed by Mr. Tunc Bilget, Chief Financial and
Economic Counselor, Embassy of the Republic of Turkey, and including
representatives from SEKA, the State Planning Organization (SPO) and the
Uadersecretariat for the Treasury and Foreign Trade. A report entitled "Staff
Appraisal Report - Turkey: Pulp and Paper Rehabilitation Project" (No.
5357-TU) dated April 5, 1985 is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. A sumnary of the proposed project is provided at the beginning of
this report and Annex III contains supplementary project data.

Project Objectives
50.      The proposed project supports the Government's objectives to improve
the efficiency of SEEs, rehabilitate existing capacity in manufacturing
enterprises and explore the potential for selective privatization of SEEs. In
line with Turkey's strategy of export promotion and efficient import
substitution, the project also aims at reducing imports of newsprint and
short-fiber bleach pulp, and increasing SEKA's export potential in selected
grades. The project would furtherucre strengthen SEKA's management and
operations.
Project Description
51.      The project consists of the following main components:
(i)   rehabilitation of the Aksu, Dalaman and Afyon mills;
(ii)   purchase of critical spare parts for all of SEKA's mills;
(iii)   identification and implementation of various energy saving
improvements for all of SEKA's mills;
(iv)   technical assistance (a) to the Government to undertake a reviev
of the pulp and paper subsector as well as a study of
privatization possibilities for SEKA; and (b) to SEKA for
improving operational procedures and strengthening its management
structure.
These components are described below.
Rehabilitation of Aksu, Dalaman and Afyon Mills
52.      Aksu Mill. The existing mill became operational in 1971 with a
design capacity of 82,500 tpy of standard newsprint. However, production over
the past nine years has averaged only 65,000 tpy, and since 1981, has been
lower than this level and is on a declining trend. In order to reduce
operational costs and increase newsprint production to 100,000 tpy, the
project would provide for debottlenecking of machinery and equipment including
two new pulp grinders, modernization of the paper machine and a package
boiler. The projected increase in newsprint production would require an
additional volume of coniferous wood amounting to about four percent of SEKA's
present annual wood requirements. The Government has confirmed that SEKA
would be provided with wood supplies sufficient to ensure that SEKA is at all
times able to operate at full capacity, and in this respect, would furnish to
the Bank not later than October 31 of each year a report covering all relevant
information on the suceeding year's provision of wood supplies, and would take
into account the Bank's comments prior to finalizing the protocol with wood
suppliers (Loan Agreement, Section 4.03).
53.      Dalaman Mill. The Dalaman mill was completed in 1970 with a design
capacity of about 75,000 tpy of bleached kraft pulp; one paper machine
currently produces printing and writing paper (38,000 tpy) and the second
produces a variety of paperboard (37,000 tpy), of which unbleached kraft
linerboard is a major component. SEKA's new mill at Akdeniz began comercial
production of unbleached linerboard in 1984, and this grade will nov be
displaced from the Dalaman mill. Under the proposed project, the board
machine at Dalaman would be rebuilt to allow production of a high quality



- 17 -
paperboard which would be coated in an existing but underutilized off-machine
coater. These changes vould allow for production of about 40,000 tpy of high
quality coated and uncoated bristol and chromo boards.
54.      Afyon Mill.   This mill uses straw and reeds to produce bleached
short-fiber kraft pulp which is consumed by both SEKA and the private sector.
The mill is currently producing at 60 percent of design capacity. The
proposed project would include partial replacement and rebuilding of the
straw-handling, preparation and feeding systems. These improvements would
allow production to increase to the mill's design level of 50,000 tpy.
Spare Parts
55.      The proposed project would include purchase of critical imported
spare parts for all of SEKA's mills to make up for past shortages. The
project would also provide support for improving maintenance procedures
including adoption of monitoring systems for spare parts' inventory planning
and control.
Energy Saving Improvements
56.      Several of the proposed rehabilitation components undertaken to
increase production or for quality improvement would result in energy
conservation. In addition, the project would provide funds to identify and
implement low-cost energy saving improvements in all of SEKA's mills,
including increasing recirculation and reuse of process water. SEKA would
select, on the basis of criteria acceptable to the Bank, a program of
energy-saving projects for review and approval by the Bank (Project Agreement,
Section 2.04).
Technical Assistance
57.      Through the Bank's previous involvement and continuing dialogue with
the Government, considerable knowledge of the pulp and paper subsector is now
available. About 30 man-months of expert services would be provided under the
project to undertake a study to assist the Government in identifying a
strategy for the future development of the subsector including possibilities
for privatization of SEKA. This study would examine such aspects of the pulp
and paper subsector as the appropriate industrial structure and policy
environment, the key resources required by the industry and the institutional
relationship between SEKA and the Government. The study would be carried out
by the SPO in collaboration with SEKA and other government agencies. The
Government would make arrangements, satisfactory to the Bank, by
December 31, 1985 for carrying out the study and would furnish to the Bank, by
September 30, 1986, the indings and recommendations of the study for review
aad discussion (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03).
58.      The technical assistance program for SEKA has been designed in two
phases. The first phase would aim at improving SEKA's operational and
maintenance procedures at the Caycuma mill (selected by SEKA as a
demonstration plant) and would concentrate on such areas as production
planning, quality control and inventory and maintenance systems. During this
phase, critical spare parts would be purchased and energy-saving and
environmental improvement programs for all of SEKA's mills would be
developed. The second phase would be undertaken after completion of the
subsector study referred to above in order to take into account
recommendations impacting on SEKA's organizational and management structure.



- 18 -
The second phase would focus on strengthening SEKA's corporate structure
through improving its financial accounting and control systems, developing a
manatement information system and adopting appropriate management training
programs. The project would include approximately 200 man-months of expert
services for these purposes. Agreement has been reached with SIKA on the
terms of reference for the technical assistance program. SEKA would establish
and maintain a committee, with representation acceptable to the Bank, to carry
out its technical assistance program and would appoint the committee chairman
by March 31, 1986 (Project Agreement, Section 2.03 (b) and Cc)).
Environmental Impact
59.      Chemical and fiber losses from SEKA's mills in the effluent are
generally high and in some cases damaging to the environment. The proposed
energy conservation measures would institute changes in mill systems and
operating procedures aimed at reducing water consumption as well as effluent
discharges to the air and water from SEKA's mills. Progress made by SEKA to
reduce pollution from its mills would be monitored against the Bank's effluent
guidelines for the pulp and paper industry. SEKA would furnish to the Bank
semi-annual reports covering its environmental activities and accomplimnments
(Project Agreement, Section 2.05(b)).
Project Implementation
60.      A Project Implementation Unit has been established in SEKA's General
Directorate. Both the Project Manager and his Deputy have broad experience in
the pulp and paper industry. Consultants would be employed for the duration
of the project to assist in project management avd engineering design as well
as for implementing the technical assistance program. These consultants are
expected to be appointed by December 31, 1985. Release of funds under the
loan for the technical assistance component to SEKA and for physical
rehabilitation is subject to appointment of these consultants (Loan Agreement,
Schedule 1).
Project Cost and Financing
61.      The total project cost including working capital and interest during
construction is $86.8 million, excluding taxes and duties. The foreign
exchange component is estimated at $55.1 million or 63 percent of total
project costs. A physical contingency allowance of about thirteen percent
($7.2 million) has been added to the cost of all project items. Price
contingencies, amounting to $17.9 million or 28 percent of the base cost plus
physical contingencies, assume international inflation rates of 3.5 percent in
1984, 8 percent in 1985 and 9 percent for the remainder of the implementation
period. Technical assistance costs include salaries, housing, relocation and
international travel costs of consultants as well as the cost of local
services such as local travel, subsistance, recruitment and overhead. The
Bank loan of $55.1 million would finance the estimated foreign exchange
component of the proposed project. The Governmpnt would finance the balance
of project costs (estimated at $31.7 million) which includes an equity
contribution to SEKA amounting to $31.6 million equivalent (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.01(c)).



- 19 -
Onlending Arrangements
62.      The proposed loan of $55.1 million would be made to the Government of
Turkey for 17 years including four years of grace, at the Bank's standard
variable interest rate. The Government would retain $0.3 million to finance
the foreign '.%change cost of the pulp and paper subsector study. The
Government would onlend to SEKA, under a Subsidiary Financing Agreement, the
balance of $54.8 million for a period of fifteen years including four years of
grace, at the Bank's prevailing variable interest rate plus a mark-up of one
percentage point (Loan Agreement, Section 3.01(d)).  Signing of a Subsidiary
Financing Agreement between the Government and SEKA is a condition of loan
effectiveness (Loan Agreement, Section 6.01). The foreign exchange risk would
be borne by SEKA.
Financial Projections
63.      SEKA's financial situation improved in 1984 mainly on account of the
Government's financial restructuring package and SEKA's price increases (para.
45). Its financial position would be further improved as a result of the
project. The estimated pre-tax financial rate of return for the proposed
project would be about 34 percent. By 1989 when the production targets under
the project are expected to be attained, it is estimated that SEKA's net sales
revenues wouli reach $545 million equivalent, with a pre-tax net income of
about $43 million equivalent. Gross profit on net revenue is projected to be
about 15 percent, with gross profit on cost of goods sold estimated at close
to 18 percent. SEKA's debt-service coverage ratio is projected to reach 2.6
in 1989. It has been agreed that SEKA would (i) maintain a current ratio of
not less than 1.1 for fiscal year 1986, and not less than 1.2 for each fiscal
year thereafter; (ii) not declare any dividend or make any other distribution
with respect to its share capital which would cause the current ratio to fall
below 1.5 in that fiscal year; and (iii) not incur any additional debt unless
a reasonable forecast of revenues and expenditures for each year during the
term of the debt to be incurred shows that the debt-service coverage would not
fall below 1.3 (Project Agreement, Sections 4.03, 4.04, and 4.05). SEKA's
pricing policy is in accordance with the provisions of SEE Reform Decree No.
233 of June 1984 which allows SEEs the freedom to establish prices for their
goods and services in line with market conditions. It is SEKA's objective to
produce efficiently so as to be in a position to set prices at levels which do
not depend on protection measures and are not increased unduly to cover high
costs caused by inefficient operations. SEKA and the Bank would exchange
views, from time to time, at the request of either party, on operational and
pricing policies and measures to be taken for their implementation (Project
Agreement, Section 4.02).
Procurement and Disbursement
64.      All equipment and machinery to be financed by the Bank will be
procured in accordance with Bank guidelines through international competitive
bidding (ICB), except for items of a proprietary nature which may be procured
through direct purchasing, miscellaneous items costing less than $400,000 each
and spare parts, which may be procured through international shopping on the
basis of at least three quotations in accordance with procedures acceptable to
the Bank. The aggregate amounts of such non-ICB purchases would not exceed
$4,000,000 for miscellaneous items and $4,000,000 for spare parts. About 74
percent of the Bank loan is expected to be disbursed against items procured
through ICB procedures (Table 2). Technical assistance would be obtained in
accordance with Bank guidelines for consultants.

65.      The proposed loan would be disbursed against 100 percent of foreign
expenditures and local expenditures ex-factory for machinery, equipment and
materials; 100 percent of foreign expenditures for working capital costs;
100 percent of the foreign exchange cost of foreign consultant services; and
80 percent of the total cost of local consultants. The disbursement
percentage for local consultants is calculated to be equivalent approximately
to the percentage resulting from covering the foreign exchange costs of
foreign consultancy contracts. The loan would also finance interest during
the construction period and would refinance the advance from the PPF of
$560,000 for preparation of this project. 'nlike previous operations in the
subsector, the proposed project involves virtually no civil works, new
processes or design-concepts and is confined solely to upgrading of existing
equipment. Hence the project is expected to be completed by September
30, 1989. In order to ensure that Turkey would have ready access to foreign



- 21 -
exchange, a Special Account would be established in the Central Bank of Turkey
to which the World Bank would make an initial revolving deposit of $4 million.
The Special Account would be replenished against withdrawal applications at
monthly intervals or as appropriate when the undisbursed balance of the
Account is equal to 50 percent or less of the amount of the initial deposit.
Expenditures would be supported by statements of expenditure which would be
made available for examination by Bank supervision missions.
Accounting and Audit
66.      SEKA would maintain records and accounts adequate to reflect its
operations and financial condition, and would provide to the Bank the records,
financial statements and audited reports that are normally requested from Bank
borrowers and beneficiaries. An annual audit would be carried out by auditors
and would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the end of each fiscal
year (Project Agreement, Section 4.01). For this purpose, the Bank's
guidelines on financial reporting would be followed.
Project Benefits and Risks
67.      The proposed project would reduce the average cost of production at
the three mills and improve product quality at the Dalaman mill, thereby
allowing higher selling prices for its products. It would also increase the
production volume at the Aksu and Afyon mills by approximately 50 percent and
60 percent, respectively. The estimated economic rate of return for the three
mills combined is estimated to be 41 percent. Because project components have
been designed to improve and expand existLag facilities, the rate of return is
considerably higher than could be expected for investments in new pulp and
paper projects. The proposed project would reduce imports of newsprint and
short-fiber bleach pulp and increase the potential for exports in selected
paper grades. When fully operational, the project would generate net foreign
exchange savings of about $29 million per year. Additional cost savings would
accrue through energy conservation and improved capacity utilization at SEKA's
mills. Further unquantified benefits to be derived from the technical
assistance component include improved sectoral policies and the identification
of a strategy for the future development of the pulp and paper subsector
encompassing both the public and private sectors. It would also strengthen
SEKA's management structure and improve its operational and maintenance
procedures.
68.      The main risk of the proposed project is that the recommended
improvements in SEKA's management and operational procedures may not be fully
realized. To increase the prospects for an effective technical and management
assistance program and to avoid delays in implementation, technical assistance
for SEKA would be carried out under the guidance of a committee comprised of
representatives from SEKA and consultants. Furthermore, SEKA's management has
demonstrated its commitment to implementation of operational and management
reforms; the technical assistance program has been discussed and agreed with
SEKA and addresses many of the problem areas identified in SEKA's own
diagnostic report on this subject. A second risk relates to the possibility
of paper prices being lower and the costs of fiber and other input prices
being higher than those projected. SEKA's freedom to set prices for its



-22 -
products in line with market forces as well.as the arraugew  s for ood
supply should significantly reduce this risk.
