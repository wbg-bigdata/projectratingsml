INTRODUCTION
The Government of Korea has requested Bank Group assistance in the
financing of a program to improve the distribution of coal and cement in the
country. The objective of the proposed project is to provide the necessary
capacity in rail, ports and inland terminals to efficiently handle forecast
coal and cement traffic and make a start in addressing system inefficiencies
in coal and cement distribution. Nearly 20 million tons each of coal and
cement are distributed annually in Korea, and these quantities are expected
to grow significantly in the future in line with the country's economic
growth and energy conservation policy, which includes greater reliance on
coal in substitution of petroleum. Rationalizing the distribution systems
for these commodities can lead to substantial transport and other cost
savings as well as energy savings.
The Ministry of Transport (MOT) was responsible for the coordination
of project preparation which involved the Korean National Railways (KNR), the
Korea Ports and Maritime Authority (KMPA), the Ministries of Energy and
Resources (MOER), Commerce and Industry (MCI) and the Economic Planning Board
(EPB). A study by local consultants RDRI/KIST was conducted in 1979 and 1980
under financing of the Sixth Railway Project (Loan 1542-KO).






I. TRANSPORT SECTOR
A. Geographic and Economic Setting
1.01      The Republic of Korea has a land area of 98,500 sq km.  About 70%
of the land area is mountainous and agriculture is confined to about 22,600
sq km, or 23% of the total area, mainly in the river valleys, lower
hillsides and coastal plains. The climate is seasonal with very cold dry
winters and hot humid summers. Annual rainfall averages 800 mm to 1,400 mm
with about 60% falling between June and September. The land mass is drained
by a well developed river system with seasonal variations in flow which give
rise to frequent flooding. The rugged terrain, river system and severe
winter climate make the construction of transport facilities, particularly
roads, difficult and costly.
1.02      The population is presently estimated at 38.2 million and growing
at an annual rate of 1.9%. Population density is estimated at 382 per sq km
of total area or 1,670 per sq km of agricultural land. Urban population is
estimated to be growing at an annual rate of 4.9% and has increased from
40.7% of the total in 1970 to 54.8% in 1982. The increasing urban
population has created significant transport demand in the areas around the
cities and industrial centers and particularly in the Seoul greater
metropolitan area.
1.03      Korea's export-led industrialization has been among the most
successful examples of economic development in recent history. During
1962-78, real GNP grew by 10% p.a. and per capita income more than trebled
in real terms. Coupled with industrialization and urbanization, major
developments and changes in the transportation sector complemented and
supported the transformation of Korea's economy. Passenger traffic tripled
between 1964 and 1971 and tripled again by 1981; freight increased nine
times and five times respectively during the same periods.
B. The Transport System
1.04      Throughout much of the past 20 years, the transport system has
been strained by the demands of rapid growth and it has required massive
public sector investments in transport infrastructure. The Government has
been allocating regularly, since the beginning of the Second Plan in 1967,
about one quarter of its total capital expenditure to expand and modernize
transport infrastructure. Investments have been concentrated on the
Seoul-Busan axis where most industrial development is taking place and other
corridors serving the northeastern and southeastern parts of Korea.



1.05      Substantial changes in the modal distribution of traffic are
illustrated by traffic statistics for the 1961 to 1981 period (Tables 1.1
and 1h2).  Freight traffic moving by rail, although showing growth in
absolute terms, fell from 88% of total ton-km to 46%, while the road and
coastal shipping shares increased from 8% to 21% and from 3% to 32%,
respectively. For passenger traffic, the rail share of total passenger-km
fell from 53% to 25% over the same period, while the road share increased
from 45% to 73%. These changes reflect both the economic advantages of the
various modes and the different growth rates experienced among industries
served, as rail and coastal shipping increasingly were concentrated on long
distances and bul]k commodities, while road transport handled the short
distance and more general cargo. In addition, rapidly expanding personal
consumption generated large increases in personal travel, further fueled by
changes in consumption patterns. Road transport has been the main
beneficiary of these increases.
1.06      The Govrernment of Korea's (GOK) basic objective over the past has
been to increase the capacity of the system in line with projected traffic
growth and to avoid major bottlenecks. This objective has been largely
achieved. The present system is reasonably balanced and there is no
substantial uneconomic allocation of traffic among the various modes.
Lnvestments in transportation have been linked to broader concerns in
Korea's spatial and economic planning.  For example, considerable efforts
have been made to develop new industrial complexes in coastal areas, to take
advantage of Korea's natural potentials in harbors and to exploit low-cost
coastal shipping while avoiding excessive congestion on road and rail.
Similarly, in its efforts to ensure that appropriate development priorities
were reflected in the allocation of scarce transportation means among the
competing claims, the Government has maintained fairly tight regulations in
the sector, invol.ving strict licensing of operators in road transport and
shipping, and administered pricing for all transport activities.  Korea's
vehicle fleet has; been kept small due to a policy of high taxation of
domestic cars and, high prices for gasoline.
1.07      Large investments in transportation infrastructure have been
complemented by EL considerable effort to improve the efficiency of the
transportation system, through the establishment and strengthening of
institutions to plan, construct, maintain and operate the facilities and
services.  In the public sector, institutions such as the Korean National
Railroad (KNR), the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) in the Ministry of
Construiction (MOC), the Korean Highway Corporation (KHC), the Korea Maritime
and Port Authority (KMPA) have been strengthened or established in many
instances with increasing financial and managerial responsibility as
semi-autonomous public corporations. In the private sector, a highly
efficient contractor system has evolved for civil works which reflects both
the insistence onL competitive bidding in the award of contracts as a matter



-3 -
of policy, and the large volume of construction work that has been carried
out in Korea during the past 20 years. There are now some 500 firms capable
of handling a broad range of public works. Furthermore, with Government
encouragement, the major construction firms have successfully expanded their
construction activities overseas; in 1981, Korean contractors won overseas
contracts valued at US$13.6 billion.
1.08      The Bank has played an active role in advising and assisting the
Korean authorities in pursuing their transport objectives. Since 1962, the
Bank Group has assisted the KNR through seven railway loans amounting to
US$434 million. The first six projects have been satisfactorily completed
and a seventh is almost fully disbursed. Cost comparisons indicate that
rail transport is still the most economic means of moving bulk cargo over
medium and long distances, and for passenger traffic over long distances.
Bank-supported investments have concentrated on improved capacity and service
relating to these functions. KNR's efficiency is among the highest of any
rail system in the world, with staff productivity per employee of 800,000
traffic units (passenger-km plus net ton-km) in 1981. The Bank has also
maintained an active dialogue on the railway's financial situation, invest-
ment plans, level and structure of tariffs. After some deterioration in the
1970s, Government agreed to implement a financial recovery plan for KNR as
part of the seventh (ongoing) railway project. Discussions of a revised
plan, following the severe downturn of the economy in the early 1980s, are
continuing. The coal and cement distribution project now proposed would
strengthen the capacity of the railways, ports and inland terminals to cope
with the expected increase in transport of these commodities, resulting
partly from large coal imports to substitute for oil.
1.09      Substantial assistance has also been extended for port develop-
ment. In part related to Korea's export drive, freight traffic through the
ports has increased from about L3 million tons in 1966 to over 120 million
tons in 1981. This large increase resulted in serious port capacity
problems, particularly at Busan, the biggest port, which handles 30% of the
country's external trade and is chronically congested. Containerization was
introduced in Busan with the assistance of the Bank under two port loans
totalling US$147 million; the Saudi Fund for Development participated with
the Bank in the financing of the first Busan Port Project. A third ports
project, to further improve container handling capacity, has been studied.
This would be in addition to port works under the proposed project.
1.10      The first four Bank-financed highway projects have had a major
impact in assisting Government with the improvement and expansion of the
national and provincial road networks and with institution building in MOC.
Significant policy changes, relating to the highway subsector, which were
effected through the highway projects include the adoption of more



-4 -
appropriate road standards, revisions of regulations governing vehicle
weights and dimensions, and a modified Government policy on toll roads.
MOC s organization to maintain the national road network was established and
strengthened through the provision of teclhnical assistance and road mainte-
nance equipment. Korean consulting firms have benefitted through their
association with foreign consultants on the design of road projects.
Results of the three projects that have been completed are highly
satisfactory.
C. Transport Objectives and Issues in the 1980s
1.11       The period of rapid and sustained growth in the Korean economy
came to an abrupt close in 1979, following the second major oil price
increase, the subsequent worsening of the international environment, and the
political transition. Near stagnation, accompanied by severe inflation and
balance of payments problems were experienced between 1979 and 1981. A
modest recovery is now in progress, with benefits from Government's deter-
mined efforts to master inflation (which declined from 29% in 1980 and 12%
in 1981 to about 5% in 1982), plus a remarkable improvement in the balance
of trade. Nevertheless, the medium-term prospects for a resumption of
Korea's former rapid progress remain uncertain. The impact on the transpor-
tation sector is two-fold. On one side, the timing of investments needed to
sustain further improvements in transport capacity and quality of service
will be influenced by growth-induced traffic expansion. On the other side,
the capacity of the public sector to finance the necessary upgrading and
extension of infrastructure and facilities in transportation may be sharply
constrained by budgetary limitations. For the medium term, the Fifth Five
Year Plan projects a GNP growth rate of 7.6% p.a. over the period 1982-86,
with a corresponding increase in transport demand estimated at about 47
billion passenger-km and 10 billion ton-km, respectively 507. and 30W above
fourth plan period outcomes. Investments in transportation (public and
private) are expected to increase by about 45% and remain at close to 14% of
the total planned outlay as in the fourth plan. They will amount to some
US$16.3 billion, calculated at 1980 prices and exchange rates.  However,
investments in subiways and aviation will absorb a larger fraction of the
total as will road vehicles and ships. Hence, real investment in the
railway system, road and port infrastructure would increase by less than 20%
above fourth plan outlays.
1.12        Whether or not economy-wide growth, transport demand and invest-
ments conform to pLan expectations, it seems clear that the period of most
rapid development in Korea's basic transport infrastructure is now over.  On
the other hand, the increasingly complex traffic patterns and higher traffic
densities, the growing requirements for maintenance of the expanded system,



- 5 -
and the need to conserve energy, will call for even greater efforts to
maximize efficiency of service and the use of scarce investment capital in
this capital-intensive sector.  Policies relating to pricing and regulation
of transport plus improved planning in respect of system development, are
crucial in the now more demanding economic environment. The preliminary
findings of the Bank's recent sector survey suggest that there is scope for
improvement in several areas.
1.13       Despite considerable efforts, spatial planning of the transporta-
tion system is still hindered by generally inadequate interagency coordina-
tion, a comparatively limited expertise in planning and economic appraisal
techniques, and in the capacity to undertake appropriate longer-term pre-
investment studies. World Bank efforts to provide support and encouragement
for these activities has met with mixed success. In 1970, a study financed
under a Transport Credit recommended that transport planning and coordina-
tion be placed in the Economic Planning Board (EPB). However, Government
decided to set up a Transport Planning Office in the Ministry of Transport
(MOT). The Government tried further, in 1975, to improve transport coordin-
ation via a Transport Coordination Committee (TCC) with representation from
the various ministries most directly concerned. The TCC, however, has not,
in practice, been able to carry out its responsibilities for the coordina-
tion of transport sector investment very satisfactorily. More effective
mechanisms are yet to be worked out. Meanwhile, the Budget Bureau, located
in EPB, exercises considerable influence on year-to-year transport invest-
ment decisions through its budgetary control powers. Currently, a Bureau of
Project Evaluation, established in 1976 in EPB, is showing interest in
transport planning, spurred by the necessity to cut back the public sector
investment program. However, its responsibilities are at present limited to
reviewing individual major investment proposals submitted by executing
agencies on a piecemeal basis. The Bureau's capability in project analysis
has been strengthened under the Bank's 1981 Structural Adjustment Loan.
1.14       The Bank has also through various projects, provided active
support and finance for technical assistance for a range of feasibility and
planning studies relating to national transport development, urban
transportation needs, inter-modal alternatives along major traffic axes
(such as the Seoul-Busan corridor) in addition to more conventional
engineering design work for proposed projects. Here too the record of
accomplishment is patchy, with experience tending to show a pattern of
relatively slow progress, reflecting in part the difficulties of sectoral
planning and transport coordination in the Korean context.
1.15       Pricing policy and the regulatory framework have been a feature
of Bank-Government dialogue for many years. In the 1970s, emphasis was
given to supporting Government's efforts to establish agencies such as KNR,
and KMPA on a sound financial basis, with investment planning linked to



appropriate tariffs and charges in regard to rail transport and ports.  The
role of the Bank has been quite effective in this regard, although the
priority given to reducing inflation in the past two years has led to some
reluctance to raise tariffs - for example in rail transportation - in line
with changes in costs.  The Bank has also assisted Government in the review
of transport and traffic regulation, notably in regard to licensing of
common carriers, road vehicle taxation, axle loading and similar issues
relating to road transportation.
1.16        It is expected that the Bank's policy dialogue would be streng-
thened in future years through the increasing emphasis being given to a
sector and subsector approach in transport lending in Korea. The recently
approved provincial and county roads project will deepen and broaden our
involvement in thes road subsector by extending assistance, for the first
time, to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MORA) which deals with the mainte-
nance of provincial roads and the maintenance and improvement of county
(gun) roads. This new involvement will also provide the Bank with an
opportunity to improve coordination of road planning between MOC and MOHA,
and will strengthen the basis for a possible highway subsector loan.
Similarly, the recently completed ports study examined broadly which ports
should be developed to handle the nation's traffic through the next decade
and may lead to a port subsector loan. For railways, the Bank has tradi-
tionally made secltor type loans, financing time slices of KNR's investment
plans with the sixth and seventh railway projects covering respectively
1978/79 and 1980/81 investments.
1.17       Besides these subsector operations, we are assisting the Govern-
ment in developing multimodal projects. The first is the Coal and Cement
Distribution Project now proposed, involving railways, ports and inland
terminals. It wi:Ll be followed by projects directed toward increasing the
capacity of the system in certain high priority areas and corridors rather
than expanding the system as a whole. The Bank will assist in developing an
integrated modal approach to meet the very high transport demand near main
urban areas where a dense network of facilities are needed. The complemen-
tarity of the various modes will be promoted by developing interconnecting
terminals so as to facilitate the use of the most economical and efficient
transport system. To this effect three separate multi-modal transport
studies have been discussed with Government: one concerning the Seoul-Busan
transport corridor and the feasibility of rail capacity increase between
Seoul and Daejon :is about to start; the second concerning the Seoul
Metropolitan region covering the Gyeonggi province is to follow in 1984; and
the third covering the southeast coastal region from Suncheon to Pohang,
where most heavy industries are concentrated, will follow later.
1.18       Bank transport projects also contain specific components to
promote the local transport consulting industry. A Korean consultant was



- 7 -
responsible for both a coal and cement distribution study and a national
comprehensive transport study. Korean consultants are assuming an
increasing share of the work and responsibilities for studies under the
Bank-s railroad, port and road projects. The development of a competent
consulting industry in the transport sector is likely to lead to significant
import substitution and export of such services.
II. COAL DISTRIBUTION
A. Background
2.01       The Coal Bureau of the Ministry of Energy and Resources (MOER) is
responsible for the administration of the coal mining industry and for
controlling coal imports in Korea. The Coal Bureau directly controls Dae Han
Coal Corporation (DHCC) the only public enterprise engaged in mining domestic
coal. DHCC contributes to about 21% of the national production. It is also
in charge of importing anthracite needed for bridging the gap of domestic
demand and supply. All other coal mining companies are privately owned and

Domestic Production
2.02       South Korean coal is exclusively anthracite; there are no known
reserves of bituminous coal.  Coal mines are concentrated in the Taebaeg
region, about 250 km east of Seoul. This area has the largest mines which,
together, produce some 75% of the country's output. Remaining production is
in the center of the country and on the west coast. A characteristic of
domestic production is the large number of small mines. As shown in Table
2.1 below, 85% of the mines account for only 17% of the production.

2.03      Domestic coal production increased rapidly in the early 1970s from
12.4 million tons in 1970 to 17.6 million tons in 1975. Since then, however,
production stagnated around 18 million tons until 1981, when it exceeded 19
million tons for the first time. The earlier goal of 24 million tons by 1981
set for the Fourth Five Year Plan was revised downward; the present forecast
is 21.5 million tons by 1986. At this rate, total minable reserves evaluated
at 630 million tons would last about 30 years; however, annual production is
expected to decline somewhat in the 1990s.
2.04      Domestic anthracite is used primarily to make briquettes for
household heating and cooking as can be seen in Table 2.2. Briquettes
are the primary form of energy used by lower income households in the cities
as well as in the rural areas. Briquettes are manufactured throughout Korea
by simple technology. Coal fines are pressed into 3.6 kg briquettes without
any special bonding material as Korean coal, with its high ash content, is
suitable for this purpose. The calorific content of domestic coal is low,
with 80% of the production in the range of 4,200 to 5,300 kcal/kg.  The
stipulated minimum calorific content of briquettes is 4,500 kcal/kg.

Imported Coal
2.05      Anthracite.  To supplement the stagnant domestic production,
Government started anthracite imports in 1978. Imported anthracite has a
minimum calorifiLc value of 5,500 kcal/kg and thus enhances domestic coal
which is mostly around 4,500 kcal/kg. However, with the present briquette
type and manufacturing techniques, it is not possible to blend more than 15%
imported anthracite since most of it does not have the same high bonding
characteristics as domestic coal. Imports have been larger than necessary



- 9 -
to meet demand as the Government chose to double the anthracite stockpile
during the last three years; this stood at about five million tons by
end-1980.

2.06       Forecast of anthracite imports for briquette making are 3.4 mil-
lion tons by 1986 and 3.2 million tons by 1991 on the basis of a slight
decrease in briquette consumption as more households, particularly in large
cities, shift to fuel oil and natural gas. Coal briquettes are inconvenient
to handle: they are dirty, they have to be changed a few times during the
day and sometimes during the night, and the burnt briquettes have to be
disposed of. Some anthracite will continue to be imported to fire existing
power plants at Busan and Ulsan. New power plants will, however, use steam
coal.
2.07       Bituminous Coal.  No bituminous coal is produced in Korea.
Imports of coking and steam bituminous coal started in 1973 with the commis-
sioning of Korea's first steel plants. Imports were 5 million tons in 1981,
(up from 0.6 million tons in 1973) of which 4 million tons is coking qual-
ity, and 1 million tons steam coal. In 1980, the cement industry started
its conversion from fuel oil to coal for kiln firing. In 1981 the industry
received over 1.3 million tons of bituminous coal. Coal consumption by the
cement industry is expected to reach 2.7 million tons in 1986 and 3.3 mil-
lion tons in 1991.
2.08       The Government is now encouraging other industries to convert
their boilers from oil to coal. As indicated in para. 5.01, savings are
substantial.  The proposed goal is to have 40-50% of all industrial boilers,
except in Seoul City, burning coal by 1991. Besides the cement industry and
industrial boilers, large quantities of bituminous coal will be imported for
new power-generating plants and for steel making. The latter are all
located on the coast and have their own ports facilities to receive coal;
therefore no inland transport will be required for either steel or power.
Table 2.4 shows a forecast of imports of bituminous coal.

B. Coal Distribution - Issues and Objectives
2.09      In general there are two major distribution patterns: one for
domestic coal and one for imported coal. Domestic coal is distributed from
mines located mostly in the eastern mountains to large urban areas of the
west and south coasts.  It is only recently that significant amounts of
coal were imported by users other than the Pohang steel mill which has
its own port. Th:is coal will move inland from the coasts, i.e., in the
opposite direction of the domestic coal, thus providing return loading
for some of the railway coal cars.
2.10      Almost all domestic coal is distributed by rail, with the
exception of 1.6 million tons, from a mine near the east coast, which go by
coastal shipping to the southern areas of Korea after being transported by
rail to the port of Mugho. In 1981, coal transport accounted for over 40%
of KNR's traffic iLn ton km. Road transport is used mainly between mineheads
and railway stations and for the distribution of briquettes to consumers.
Some road transport is also used to distribute locally the production of
small mines on the west coast. The average transport distance by rail is
around 210 km, that for coastal shipping is 330 km.
2.11      The main flows of coal are thus concentrated on a few railway
lines connecting the Taebaeg area with Seoul, Daejon and Daegu. In 1981,
Seoul City alone consumed 6ver 40% of Korea's domestic coal, and the other
five large cities another 28% leaving 32% for the rest of the country.



- 11 -
Domestic Coal Distribution
2.12      The main issue in domestic coal distribution is its complexity
resulting from the fragmentation of the mining industry and of the
briquette-making industry. There are over 210 mines and 280 briquette
plants. Furthermore, until mid-1982 coal was produced and sold under 24
different categories, according to its calorific content. The end product,
however, is uniform since briquettes have to comply with the minimum
calorific content of 4,500 kcal/kg set by Government. Therefore, briquette
makers arrange purchases of different coal grades from different mines for
blending at the plant in a way that minimizes their costs, but not
necessarily transport costs.
2.13      Over the last few years, the Government began to deal with the
above problem by fostering the consolidation of the briquette industry. In
1976, there were still some 600 briquette plants in the country versus 280
now (Table 2.5 in Annex). The consolidation happened mainly in large cities
where the number of plants was reduced to one third from 118 to 38 since
1978. Consolidation is expected to continue, and the Bugog terminal
included in the project will permit consolidation of briquette plants in the
rapidly urbanizing areas of Gyeonggi Province south of Seoul while the
Seonbug terminal will do the same in the northern suburbs. The Government
confirmed at negotiations that briquette factories will be installed in the
coal terminal by the end of 1986 (para. 7.01).
2.14      During preparation of the project, the point was made that, from a
transportation point of view, it would be desirable to reduce the number of
coal categories. MOER agreed to review the coal grading and pricing system
for domestic anthracite to improve quality control while simplifying the
present transport and distribution system. In July 1982, a new grading
system was introduced, including a reduction of the number of categories
from 24 to 9. This consolidation should enable KNR to gradually increase
the number of unit trains between the mines and the large cities. The
project also includes special side dump cars that will enable faster
unloading of coal at briquette plants and speed up the turnaround time of
freight cars.
Imported Coal Distribution
2.15      As mentioned above, the distribution of imported coal is a recent
development. For instance, anthracite imports jumped suddenly from 0.6 mil-
lion tons in 1978 to 2.0 million tons in 1980 (para. 2.05); and no facili-
ties were available to efficiently handle such large quantities. The main



12 -
issue regarding imported coal distribution is thus the lack of efficient
handling and transporting systems.  The proposed project is addressing this
problem by combined port and railway investments.
2.16       Anthracite.  Imported anthracite will be distributed from the
ports of Incheon, Ulsan and Mogpo (MAP 16509). Rail transport will be used
mainly from Incheon to the Bugog terminal and to the Daejon area via the
Su-In line, which will be extended and widened under the project. Agreement
was reached durin,g negotiations that land rights for the Su In line will be
obtained by July 1, 1986 (para. 7.01). Some coal will also go by rail from
Ulsan to Busan andl Daegu, and from Mogpo to Gwangju. The remainder will go
by truck directly to briquette plants in the vicinity of the ports.
2.17       Bituminous.  Until more industrial boilers are converted from oil
to coal, the main inland users of imported bituminous coal will be the
cement plants in the Jecheon area. Given the concentration of origins, at
the ports of Incheon and Ulsan, and of destinations, 5 plants in Jecheon
area, all this coal will go by rail. In the case of both ports, coal cars,
which are now returning empty to the mining areas from the Seoul or Busan
areas, will obtain a return load: they will be loaded with domestically-
mined anthracite on their departure from the mining area and with imported
bituminous coal on their return to the Jecheon area, which is close to the
mining area. From Incheon, bituminous coal will also use the Su-In line
referred to above.
III. CEMENT DISTRIBUTION
A. Background
3.01      The Cerarmic Industry division of the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry (MCI) is the Government body in charge of supervising cement
related matters. The installed capacity of the Korean cement industry,
entirely private owned, was 23.5 million tons p.a. at the end of 1981 more
than three times above the 1971 capacity of 7 million tons.  Except for two
small plants, the cement industry is concentrated in the north-eastern
corner of Korea (Map 16509). Five plants, located near Jecheon, some 180 km
east of Seoul, account for 42% of the presently installed capacity while two
plants, on the east coast near Bugpyeong account for 53% of the capacity.
About half of the capacity of the coastal plants was added during the last
five years. One plant is now rated at 8.8 million tons p.a. (37.6% of the
country's capacity) which reportedly makes it the largest in the world. The
nine plants in the country are owned by seven companies, with the largest
owning about 50% of the capacity.



- 13 -
3.02      The domestic demand for cement increased rapidly in the 1970s;
from 6.1 million tons in 1971 it peaked near 16 million tons in 1979. It
then contracted abruptly following the general economic downturn, reaching
only 12.4 million tons in 1981, with some recovery taking place in 1982.
Total average annual production over 1978-81, has been around 17-18 million
tons, production in excess of domestic demand was exported (Table 3.1).
Since the energy price rise in 1979 such exports barely cover variable
costs. Capacity utilization in terms of domestic demand reached a peak of
92% in 1978, but as new capacity came on stream at the time of weakening
demand, it fell to 53% in 1981. As a result the cement industry is
presently in difficult financial condition. The conversion from oil to
coal, virtually completed, provides substantial fuel cost savings to the
industry. These are estimated at about US$6 to 8 per ton of cement.

Source: MCI, EPB.
3.03      The Fifth Five Year Investment Plan indicates that the installed
capacity will reach 30.5 million tons by 1986, a 30% increase over the
capacity at the end of 1981. Domestic consumption is forecast at 26 million
tons on the basis of an 8.2% annual increase from a 15 million tons level.
The forecasts have not been adjusted as a result of the unusually low



- 14 -
domestic demand experienced in 1981. At present, however, only 1.35 million
tons capacity increase is underway (a new one mt plant is under construction
on the east coast and a plant in the Jecheon area is being modernized for
.35 million tons); and it is likely that the industry will defer further
capacity increases until clear signs of demand materialize.
3.04       The cement industry with its capital intensiveness cannot readily
adapt to wide fluctuations in demand. Rapidly increasing demand in the
early 1970's led to a doubling of capacity between 1971 and 1976. However,
in 1976 domestic demand amounted to only 69% of installed capacity versus
over 88% in 1971. As a result, in 1976, the cement industry formed a cartel
for the distribution of cement in Korea. The cartel fixes the price, which
is uniform throughout Korea. In December 1980, the Government introduced
the "Monopoly Regulation and Fair Trade Law" which among other things set
the stage for dismantling the cement cartel. The enforcement decree of
April 1, 1981 (Presidential Decree 10267) states that "collaborative
activity to overcome depression" shall only be allowed for one year periods
at a time after which the situation will be reviewed by Government. In
accordance with the above law, the cement cartel was legally abolished in
May 1982. Under the enforcement decree, EPB has granted the cement comr-
panies a one-year exension of cartel-like arrangements, in view of the very
depressed state of the industry. It has also set the following guidelines
upon which such one-year exensions might be granted in the future: when
domestic demand falls below 80% of capacity, production, shipment, and sales
territory arrangements may be permitted and when domestic demand falls below
70% of capacity price arrangements may be permitted.
B. Cement Distribution - Issues and Objectives
3.05       The distribution of cement is fairly complex.  The product moves
from production plants in three forms:  clinker, bulk and bagged cement.
Clinker and some bulk cement go through branch plants for further process-
ing, storage and some bagging while the rest of bulk cement and bagged
cement go directly to final consumption areas. The total amount transported
is thus greater than the total consumed.  In 1981, transported tons were
about 28% more than domestically consumed tons. Each of the three sub-
products are transported by rail, road and coastal shipping. Table 3.2
below summarizes the modal allocation by subproducts.

3.06      As seen in Table 3.2, rail is the main mode of transport for
cement, accounting for over 60% of the products ex-factory. In 1981 cement
accounted for 17% of KNR's traffic in ton-km. Road transport, however,
plays the main role in distribution from branch plants (93% of the indirect
tonnage). The modal allocation reflects the advantages of the various
modes, with rail and coastal shipping carrying long distance clinker and



- 16 -
bulk cement, whi:Le road transport plays a larger role in ex-factory
transport of bagged cement as well as in final distribution from branch
plants. The average transport distance of cement is around 325 km for
coastal shipping, 210 km by rail and 75 km by road.
3.07      Cement consumption is concentrated in the large urban centers.  In
1981, the Seoul-Incheon metropolitan area accounted for 45% of domestic
consumption, the next four largest cities of Busan, Daegu, Daejon and
Gwangju together consumed 35% of the total, and the rest of the country only
20%. The location of branch plants reflect the concentration of
consumption, with 80% of them located in the large cities.
3.08      The main issue in cement distribution is the relatively low pro-
portion of bulk handling which is more efficient than bags. Bulk distri-
bution offers substantial cost savings in handling and transport, the latter
due to faster turnover of equipment. It also saves the cost of bags and
bagging. While some move toward more bulk transport has occurred in recent
years, as shown below, the share of bulk is still far from the proportion
common in industrialized countries, namely 75% to 80%.

The reasons for this relatively low proportion of bulk distribution are:
(a) shortage of bulk cement rail cars;
(b) same rail tariffs for bulk and bagged cement; and
(c) restrictions on expansion and development of ready-mix concrete
(Remicon) installations.
3.09      The proposed project addresses all these points and the proportion
of bulk transport is expected to increase gradually. Rail cars will be
financed by the project and bulk and bagged tariffs will be differentiated
(para. 6.05); the cement industry has plans to install new silos, including
at the Bugog Terminal, which is a part of the proposed project. Regarding
installation of Remicon plants, the land use planning regulations were amended
at the end of 1981 and no further restrictions exist.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The objectives of the proposed project are:  (a) to provide the
necessary capacity in rail, ports and inland terminals to efficiently handle
the forecast coal and cement traffic through the 1980s; and (b) address
system inefficiencies in coal and cement distribution. The main system
inefficiencies described in paras. 2.12 for coal and 3.08 for cement are:
(a) for coal: the complexity of the distribution system due to the
fragmented coal mining and briquette industries; and (b) for cement: the
large proportion of cement still transported and distributed in bags rather
than in bulk.
B. Project Description
4.02      The project would consist of:
(a)  Investments to increase capacity in:
(i) specialized intermodal freight terminals for coal and
cement;
(ii) railways and ports infrastructure at Incheon and Ulsan; and
(iii) specialized cars for coal and cement transport.
(b) Measures to address system inefficiencies
(i) policy measures regarding transport pricing of anthracite
and bituminous coal and of bulk and bagged cement. These
are discussed in Chapter VI;
(ii) operational improvements in train operations and
locomotive utilization;
(iii) operational improvements in the two project ports; and
(iv) studies, technical assistance, and training.
A detailed project description is given in Annexes 4.1 and 4.2.
Intermodal Terminals
4.03      Both coal and cement are heavy commodities transported in large
quantities over fairly long distances in Korea. The small size of many



- 18 -
users, however, does not generally justify the cost of private rail sidings.
Therefore, the delivery of smaller volumes is better handled by truck, which
calls for adequate intermodal terminals. Two are envisaged in the Seoul
area: Bugog to the south and, later, Seongbug to the northeast. Bugog will
have a capacity of 10 million tons per year, and civil works have started,
financed under KNR's budget. The Bugog terminal will be completed during
the project period and rails and ties will be financed by the proposed loan;
equipment for coal handling and for signalling will be financed from the
Government budget and cofinancing.
4.04      The Bugog terminal will provide intermodal services for coal and
cement. In the coal area, land has been reserved for the future instal-
lation of briquette manufacturing plants, some of which would be relocated
from their present sites in downtown Seoul, thereby reducing urban pollution
and pursuing consolidation of the industry. Land has also been reserved for
building cement silos. Part of the terminal will also be used for inter-
modal transfer of containers in order to combine the advantage of lower
costs for rail transport between the Seoul area and Busan and the flexibil-
ity of door to door pick-up and delivery by truck. The project will provide
an ample paved storage area and the container handling equipment will be
purchased by the operating company. The Government confirmed at negotia-
tions that land rights for the installation of briquette factories and for
construction of ceiment silos will be granted not later than January 1, 1984
(para. 7.01).
4.05      At negotiations the Government confirmed also, that it would pro-
vide the Bank not later than thirty days after loan effectiveness with time-
tables for completion by December 31, 1986 of (a) the Bugog terminal
including the access road; (b) the Incheon and Ulsan port coal terminals;
and (c) the widening of the Su-In line.
Investments in Railways and Ports Infrastructure, and Specialized Cars
4.06      Railway investments would increase carrying capacity and reduce
overall transportation costs on the lines carrying the main coal and cement
traffic (Tables 5.5 and 5.7). They comprise: the electrification of a
64 km section of the Jung Ang line, the upgrading of the signalling on
126.8 km of the Taebaeg line, the widening of the Su In line (53.2 km) from
narrow to standard gauge together with the building of a 10 km section to
reconnect it to Incheon port, and the acquisition of specialized rolling
stock: 261 coal and 320 cement tank cars. Details are given in Annex 4.1.
4.07      Due to their proximity to consumption areas, the ports of Incheon,
Ulsan, Mogpo and Bugpyeong were selected to handle imported coal traffic for
household and industrial uses other than those of the steel mill or large
power plants which have their own ports. New terminals are needed at these
ports to handle the expected coal traffic.  Only the terminals at Incheon
and Ulsan are incladed in this project, the other two ports will be developed
later since they are less urgent. Civil works construction at these are



- 19 -
presently designed to handle 4.5 and 3 million tons per year respectively.
These capacities could be increased later should the traffic warrant it.
Details are given inr Annex 4.2.
Operational Improvements
4.08      One of the objectives of this project is to further improve the
already good operational performance of KNR in transporting coal and cement.
To this end, specialized coal cars will be procured including a trial order
of side-dumper cars, a technological improvement to be used for the first
time in Korea. Also, more cement tank cars will be added to the fleet, to
increase the percentage of cement transported in bulk. By speeding up
loading and unloading operations, and by making more use of these
specialized cars in unit trains, the turnaround time and resulting transpor-
tation costs will decrease.
4.09      During the preparation of the project, the utilization of KNR's
locomotives was analyzed in detail. In general, both the availability and
the utilization of the locomotives are better than in most railways in the
world.  Availability is in the 88-90% range for both diesel and electric
locomotives. Diesels run a high average of 156,000 km per year while
electrics run between 117,000 and 120,000 km per year, still a good
performance. However, the electrics are less utilized than the diesels,
because the fleet is large in relation to the length of the electrified
network (90 units for 429 ki).  During discussions with KNR, the conclusion
was reached that, provided lighter passenger trains presently hauled by
electric locomotives are hauled by smaller diesel units, the present fleet
of electric locomotives would be adequate to haul all of KNR's freight
traffic on the extended electrified network, including the additional 64 km
of the Jung Ang line to be electrified under the project. Since light
passenger trains would be haujled by medium power diesels and heavy freight
trains by high power electrics, a better use would be made of the motive
power available. The more efficient use of existing motive power will lead
to substantial cost savings. Furthermore, only five diesels will be needed
after 1986 to cope with the expected traffic increase, instead of 13 should
the Jung Ang line not be electrified.
4.10      Another objective of this project is to improve the operational
performance of KMPA in handling coal in the ports of Incheon and Ulsan.
Towards this end, a coal terminal is already under construction at each
port. Specialized equipment such as unloaders, conveyor belts, stackers,
and reclaimers will be procured. This will result in speeding up coal
unloading operations and in lowering port costs.

Studies, Technical Assistance and Training
4.11      These include:
(a) Consulting services to assist KMPA in preparing technical speci-
fications and tender documents for items to be procured under ICB;
(b)  Training of KMPA personnel in operation and maintenance of coal
terminals; and
(c) Seoul metropolitan region (Gyeonggi-do) integrated transport
study;
Study (c) is not related to this project, but is part of a set of sector
studies aimed at preparing future developments of the Korean transport
system (Annex 4.3).
C. Cost Estimates
4.12      The total cost of the project is estimated at W 357.2 billion
(US$479.4 million equivalent) of which the foreign exchange is estimated to
be about 50% or about US$242 million. Taxes and duties are about 10% of
total project cost. The cost of civil works is based on final engineering.
Unit prices of equipment are in line with prices experienced by KNR and KMPA
in recent procurement and consistent with prices for similar items procured
under Bank loans. Physical contingencies of 5% are included for all items
except rolling stock, maintenance equipment, ports equipment, studies and
technical assistance. Annual price escalation rates were applied to local
and foreign costs in accordance with Bank guidelines, as follows: 8% in
1983, 7.5% in 1984, 7% in 1985 and 6% in 1986. An exchange rate of Won 745
to the US dollar was used for the calculation of the US dollar equivalent
costs.
4.13      The total cost of providing 19 man-months of consultant time to
KMPA for assistance in procurement and layout design for the coal terminals
is estimated at about US$326,000 of which US$228,000 is foreign exchange.
The average man-monrth cost including salary, international travel, subsis-
tence and overhead would be about US$12,000. In addition, $58,000 would be
earmarked for training KMPA personnel abroad.
4.14      Summary project cost estimates are as follows (detailed estimates
are given in Table 4.1):

D. Financing
4.15      The total cost of the project is estimated at US$497.4 million
with a foreign exchange component of US$241.9 million. It will be financed
in part by Governlment budget allocations to KNR and KMPA. The proposed Bank
loan will contribute US$122.0 million equivalent toward the foreign exchange
cost (Table 4.2).  Cofinancing is being arranged for the balance but will
not be needed before end 1984.  The proposed Bank loan would be used for
financing (a) part of the foreign component of the project's railway compo-
nent; (b) a share of the ports component; and (c) studies, technical assist-
ance and training.  The cofinanced borrowing would be applied to the Ports
components includling the financing of any contingencies.  Assurances on this
were obtained during negotiations (para. 7.01). The front-end fee of about
US$0.3 million (W 2 million equivalent) would be financed from the Bank loan
and is included in the loan amount.
Terms of Loans
4.16      GOK will repay the Bank loan over a 15-year period including an
initial three-year grace period at the standard variable interest rate. It
is proposed that a portion of the Bank loan will be onlent to each KNR and
KMPA, through subsidiary loan agreements at the same interest rate and
terms as the Bank loan. KNR and KMPA will bear the foreign exchange risk
for their respective shares of the loan. Government will pass on the
responsibility for repayment of the front-end fee to KNR and KMPA for their
respective portions of the loan. These transactions will be covered under
subsidiary loan agreements, the signing of which would be conditions of
loan effectiveness (para. 7.01). These arrangements were confirmed during
negotiations.
E. Implementation
4.17      To coordinate the goals and actions of the various government
agencies and private firms concerned, the Government established a Project
Coordinating Committee comprising all parties interested in the project.
Under the chairmanship of the Director General for Transport Coordination,
MOT, members of the Committee represent MOT, MOF, EPB, MCI, MOER, KNR and
KMPA. The role of the Committee is only consultative, but its recommenda-
tions carry weight since the most influential ministries and Government
agencies are represented. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
Committee would meet at least four times a year (para. 7.01).
4.18      The Coordinating Committee took an active part in the last phase
of the preparation of this project and was instrumental in ironing out
differences of opinion between some agencies involved. During implementa-
tion of the project, its role will be equally important. To help the
Chairman of the Coordinating Committee, a Project Administrator has been



- -3 -
hired. He is a Korean civil servant whose qualifications, experience, and
terms of reference are acceptable to the Bank. The Project Administrator will
be supported in day to day project administration by an assistant assigned
full time to the Project. Agreement on this was confirmed at negotiations
(para. 7.01). The Project Administrator participated in negotiations.
4.19      The project will be implemented by KNR for the railway related
components, and by KMPA for the port related components. Under its present
status KNR is vested with powers and a degree of financial freedom which
allows it to conduct its operations in a satisfactory manner. Further legal
powers and financial freedom will be needed for improving KNR's efficiency.
KNR will be given such powers by january 1, 1987 under the Seventh Railway
Project (Loan 1836-KO). KMPA does not enjoy the same degree of freedom, a
situation which adversely affects its productivity and related financial
performance. To improve the latter it was agreed at negotiations that GOK
would not later than January 1, 1986 vest K!WA with legal autonomy needed for
(a) incurring debt; (b) prepare and submit its budgets and accounts in a
commercial form; (c) have reasonable flexibility in adjusting approved
operating budgets to meet cost changes resulting from unexpected fluctuations
in port traffic; and (d) open an account with the Bank of Korea for revenue
receipts and payment of obligations (para. 7.01).
4.20      The Coordinating Committee would be responsible for coordination
between them and other ministries involved (mainly MOER and MCI). Both KNR
and KMPA have enough competentI staff to ensure that the project is implemen-
ted correctly and on tiTe.  Some external specialized technical assistance
to KMPA would be required for drafting technical specifications for the coal
handling equipment to be acquired, to assist during the procurement process,
and for trainling port staff in coal handling. Assurances for this were
obtained at negotiations (para. 7.01).
F. Procurement
4.21     AM. civil works contracts are or will be awarded by KNR and KMPA
in accordance with the country's procurement procedures which are satis-
factory. Civil works will not be financed by the Bank. Equipment items to
be procured under the loan and estimated to cost about US$103.2 million
without contingencies, will be subject to International Competitive Bidding
(ICB), in accordance with Bank guidelines. For bid evaluation, Korean
manufacturers will be allowed a preferential margin of 15% of CIF costs of
competing imports or the relevant prevailing level of customs duties, which-
ever is lower. For non-Bank financed items, the Government's or cofinancing
entities' procurement procedures will apply.
4.22      The various components of the port coal handling equipment must be
integrated and will therefore be procured under two tenders, one for each
port.  The Ports equipment will be partially financed by the proposed loan,
the rest by cofinancing.



- 24 -
4.23      Technical assistance to KMPA for the drafting of technical speci-
fications and preparation of tender documents for coal handling equipment
will be selected on the basis of a short list with terms of reference agreed
with the Bank. Training of personnel in coal terminal operations outside
Korea will be arranged by the Government. The foreign cost of this training
will be covered by the loan.
G. Disbursement
4.24      Disbursements will be made on the following basis:
(a)  100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment and
materials for the railways, and 100% for directly imported equip-
ment and materials for the ports;
(b) 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory price) for locally manufac-
tured equipment and materials for the railways and 100% of local
expenditures (ex-factory price) for locally manufactured equipment
and materials for the ports;
(c) 100% of the costs of foreign and local consulting services; and
(d) 100% of the cost of overseas training.
4.25      Bank disbursements are expected to be completed by June 1987.  An
estimated quarterly schedule of disbursements is given in Table 4.3. The
disbursement schedule is based on project implementation schedules with
provision for minor delays. The disbursement profile is similar to that for
previous projects iLn Korea.
H. Environment
4.26      No negative impact on the environment is anticipated from the
project. The inland transport of large amounts of imported coal by rail will
prevent the pollution that would result from moving such quantities by road,
particularly through the large Seoul-Incheon metropolitan area. Also, the
establishment of briquette factories in Bugog will help reduce the pollution
in the Seoul metropolitan area. The electrification of the 64 km section of
the Jung Ang line will reduce pollution in the area.

V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Main Benefits and Beneficiaries
5.01      The project would help improve the efficiency with which coal and
cement are transported and distributed in Korea. It would also contribute to
the effort made by Korea in diversifying its energy sources i.e., substitut-
ing coal for oil. Port facilities, inland terminals and the railway lines
connecting them have to be developed or upgraded to cope with this new coal
traffic. Each ton of imported bituminous coal can substitute for about 2/3
of a ton of fuel oil. At 1982 CIF Korea prices of US$70 per ton for coal
and US$207 per ton for fuel oil, each ton of bituminous coal used repre-
sents savings of about US$70. Imports of bituminous coal through the ports
of Incheon and Ulsan, included in this project, are forecast at 2.6 million
tons in 1986 and 6.1 million tons in 1991. The foreign exchange cost
savings for the year 1986 alone would be almost US$180 million. While other
investments are needed to convert industrial boilers from oil to coal, the
annual savings are indeed large in relation to the investment costs in
transport and industry. Studies made by MOER and the cement industry indi-
cate that the cost of conversion to coal can be recouped within 2-3 years.
5.02      Besides its contribution to a  reduced energy import bill for
Korea, the project will also help increase productivity in the distribution
of two widely consumed commodities, domestic coal and cement. Over 85% of
domestic anthracite goes to make briquettes, the primary energy source of
urban and rural lower income households. Transport cost accounts for 15-20%
of total briquette cost. The project would thus assist Government in its
constant endeavor to keep briquette prices as low as possible. Similarly,
cement is a component of most projects and any cost savings in distribution
will be reflected throughout the economy.
5.03      Of the total project cost, roughly 57% will go to investments
necessary to handle imported bituminous coal, while the remainder will go to
improve the distribution of domestic coal and cement. Included in the
latter is the Bugog terminal, which will serve both domestic and imported
coal, cement and also container traffic. The detailed economic analysis of
the major project components is given below. Some project components are
closely interrelated and can only be analyzed jointly since the benefits
would not occur if only some of the components were implemented.
B. Investments Related to Imported Coal
5.04      These investments include the coal facilities at the ports of
Incheon and Ulsan, the widening of the Su-In line and its connection to
Incheon, and part of the Bugog terminal. The coal traffic forecast through
the two ports and the allocation by mode for inland distribution from the



- 26 -
ports are given in Table 5.1; the detailed traffic forecast for anthracite
and bituminous coal on the Su-In line, is given in Table 5.2. The coal
arriving in Incheon will generally be used in the Seoul-Daejon area and that
arriving in Ulsan in the southeastern industrial area. The exception is the
bituminous coal for the cement plants of the Jecheon area (Map IBRD 16509)
which will arrive through both Incheon (2/3), and Ulsan (1/3). Using
Incheon and the Su-In line is very attractive, as domestic coal cars coming
from the mining areas to Seoul will obtain a return load of imported
bituminous coal instead of returning empty as at present (Annex 4.1
para. 9).
5.05      Incheon Port and Su-In Line.  The port of Incheon is presently not
equipped to receive large quantities of coal and ad hoc lighterage has been
used since anthracite imports began in 1978. The process is very cumbersome
and expensive. Ships anchored outside the port unload their cargoes with
their own gear into lighters, which then have to be unloaded on a wharf,
where storage is done by trucks and bulldozers. Coal is then reloaded on
trucks for distribution within the metropolitan area. Trucks also bring
coal for longer distance transport to the Incheon rail station. This
multiple handling is not only costly but highly polluting in dense urban
areas. The proposed coal terminal would be able to receive efficient size
coal carriers namely 100,000 DWT ships versus 25,000 DWT without the
project; it would also have proper stacking/reclaiming of coal and loading
into rail cars for direct transport to Bugog and the Jecheon area via the
widened Su-In line. The coal pier and its rail connection to KNR-s network
the Su-In line - form a whole which can only be analyzed jointly. Benefits
in terms of transport and handling cost savings, including shiptime savings,
would yield an ERPR of 22% (Table 5.3). As the anthracite traffic is
expected to decrease somewhat between now and 1986, and the cement plants
are virtually converted to coal already, the only uncertainty on the benefit
side is the forecast bituminous coal traffic for other industrial users.
Assuming that only 50% of that forecast traffic occurs, the ERR would fall
to 18%. On the cost side, a 20% increase would reduce the ERR to 19%.
5.06      Ulsan Port.  The present situation is similar to that of Incheon.
The same type of benefits as above yield a return of 28% (Table 5.4). Again
assuming that only 50% of the bituminous coal traffic to industrial users
other than the cement plants materialize, the ERR would fall to 18%, while a
20% cost increase would reduce the ERR to 25%.
C. Investments Related to Domestic Coal and Cement
5.07      Tae-Baeg Line Signalling and Coal Cars.  This is the direct line
between the Seoul area and the major Korean coal fields. The line also
carries some cement from the east coast, and the first section east of
Jecheon, the cement from two of the five plants in the area. The remaining



- 27 -
three plants are on the section of the Jung-Ang line proposed for electrifi-
cation and discussed below. Traffic forecasts on the line are given by
commodity and by section in Table 5.5. In 1981, freight traffic on various
sections ranged from 6.5 million tons (86% coal) to 11.5 million tons (60%
coal, 23% cement); and passenger traffic from 1.0 to 1.4 million passengers.
Beyond the first section to the cement plants, the line is in very moun-
tainous terrain and approaching capacity. Centralized Traffic Control
(CTC), which exists from Seoul to Jecheon, would be extended to the Tae Baeg
Line. The central control of the entire line would remove capacity bottle-
necks for the traffic forecast until 1991, by increasing line capacity by
some 15 to 20%. This would enable the line to carry just under 1 million
ton more coal than now. To carry this coal will also require additional
coal cars. No other transport alternatives exist; and to develop any would
be much more costly than the proposed project. The next best alternative
would then be to substitute imported anthracite for domestic coal which
could not be transported and therefore not produced. At present, the cost
of domestic coal is estimated at US$57 per ton including subsidies and
quality differential and that of imported anthracite at US$66 per ton
(US$60 CIF plus US$6 distribution costs). The project would also enable
transport of more cement both from the east coast and from plants in the
Jecheon area. The benefits of the project in terms of coal import cost
savings and cement transport cost savings yield a rate of return of 25%
(Table 5.6). Increases in either the coal traffic or in the cement traffic
could be nil, or costs could triple before the ERR would fall below 10%.
The coal import cost savings have been assumed to decrease by 50% between
1986 and 1996, to reflect the expected cost increase in real terms of coal
mining in Korea.
5.08      Jung-Ang Line Electrification.  In 1981, traffic on this 64 km
section of the Jung Ang Line proposed for electrification ranged from 6 to
7 million tons (coal 35%, cement 40%), and passenger traffic was about 2
million. Traffic forecasts are given in Table 5.7. Electrification would
permit improved utilization of electric locomotives presently in service on
the western section of the line and the Tae-Baeg line. It would also
generate energy cost savings, and maintenance and labor cost savings. These
benefits would yield an ERR of 22% (Table 5.8). The high rate of return is
due in part to the better utilization of existing electric locomotives.
Other benefits could jointly decrease by 50%, or costs could increase by 50%
before the ERR would fall below 10%.
5.09      Cement Tank Cars.  The utilization of cement tank cars is much
better than that of box cars which transport cement in bags. Due to the
difference in turnaround time (Annex 4.1 para. 12), the capital cost of box
cars that would be needed to transport the same amount of cement as the
proposed tank cars would be W2 billion (US$2.7 million) more than thee cost
of tank cars (Table 5.9). Furthermore, tank cars provide for further
savings in loading and unloading. Including the cost of silos necessary to
implement the conversion to bulk transport, the ERR is estimated at 68%.
This ERR does not depend upon cement traffic growth since the project
applies to a fraction of existing cement traffic only.



- 28 -
D. Overall Evaluation and Risks
5.10      When the costs and benefits of all the above elements are com-
bined, adding also the costs of the two multi-purpose, multi-modal terminals
fo Bugog and Seongbug, and some track maintenance equipment, the overall ERR
of the project is 19% (Table 5.10). These terminals are linked with the
various project components analyzed above and no further benefits are
assigned to them separately. Also, this overall return this does not
include benefits from improved container transport made possible by the
Bugog terminal.
5.11      All project components involve proven technology that has been in
extended use in Korea and other parts of the world; technological risks con-
nected with the project are therefore small. In addition, training is
provided under the project for KMPA personnel involved in operating the new
coal handling equipment. The sensitivity of project component returns has
been described in the respective component analysis above and the risk is
very low that the rate of return would fall below 10% for any component and
even lower for the project as a whole.
VI.  FINANCES
A. Background
6.01       Implementation of the proposed project is expected to allow KNR
and KMPA to meet anticipated increases in demand for transporting imported
and locally mined coal and locally produced cement. The objective of the
financial analysis is to define conditions under which transport of these
two components will help improve KNR's and KMPA's overall financial situa-
tion. The analysis covers the following: (a) KNR's overall financial
situation; (b) cost coverage of coal and cement, rail tariffs; and (c)
conditions under which Incheon and Ulsan ports' new coal terminals will
generate a profit for KMPA.
B. KNR's Financial Situation
6.02      Despite KNR's high technical efficiency, its financial performance
has steadily deteriorated since 1979. This is because KNR's gross operating
revenue declined in real terms due to the stagnation of traffic resulting
from the overall economic situation while operating costs remained virtually
steady. The main financial problem of KNR is the very large losses incurred
on ordinary passenger trains and to a lesser extent on commuters (in Korea
commuters refer to season ticket holders rather than to urban trips). These
losses amounted to W 66 billion (US$90 million) in 1981, compared with a
total net deficit of W 62.9  billion meaning that KNR would have generated a
net profit if it had been allowed to charge cost based tariffs on this



- 29 -
traffic. The same situation is expected to occur in 1982. The reason for
such losses is the very low tariff applied to ordinary train passengers:
6.30 W/km in relation to total costs of 17.6 W/kn in 1981. In comparison,
ordinary bus fares were about 12 W/km. In the past, losses incurred on
ordinary trains and commuter traffic were to a substantial extent offset by
profits generated by express trains. However, this is no longer true due to
the adverse effect of traffic stagnation on express trains' profits. As a
result KNR has not been able to meet the rate of return covenant of Loan
1836-KO (Seventh Railway Project).
6.03      Another problem is KNRs heavy debt service, and in particular
interest payments. As freight tariffs were historically well below cost and
ordinary train tariffs remained at only one-third of costs, KNR could not,
in the past, generate enough funds internally to finance the investments
needed for modernization and expansion. In recent years, investments
financed through loans were made to accommodate traffic expected to continue
growing at the rates experienced in the late 197 . Traffic, however, has
stagnated and KNR is now committed to cover the related debt service while
its revenue anticipation did not materialize. As a result, KNR's short-term
(less than one year) payables as of December 31, 1982 exceeded liquid assets
(cash plus receivables) by W 105 billion of which W 67 billion in loan
maturities. The ratio of current assets to current liabilities by the same
date reached 0.3 instead of the 1.5 objective provided for under Section 3.05
of the Loan Agreement 1836-KO (Seventh Railway Project).
6.04      In our ongoing dialogue with the Cbvernment, we have been discuss-
ing ways and means to improve KNR-s financial situation. In particular, in
November 1982, we suggested that the Gbvernment take action among the
following remedial measures:
(a)  selective tariff increases comprising measures proposed in
paras. 6.04 and 6.05;
(b)  compensation for losses on social services (ordinary passengers
and commuters);
(c)  adjustment of the original 1982-86 investment plan to fit the
anticipated reduction in traffic demand; and
(d)  easing of the debt service obligation of KNR through Gbvernment
subsidies.
6.05      On December 15, 1982, Government increased rail tariffs by 4.5%
for passengers and 6.6% for freight. This is on top of the 4.7% for passen-
gers and 5% for freight applied in July 1982.  In February 1983, the m verr-
ment also submitted a 1983-86 financial plan for KNR based on guidelines
from EPB's budget bureau dealing with the above four matters and KNR's
proposal for reducing costs. Details of the guidelines and the cost reduc-
tion plan are given in the project file.



- 30 -
KNR's Financial Objectives 1983-88
6.06      The major objective of the plan is to gradually reduce subsidies
against operating losses, with a view to discontinue them by 1986. The
plan would lead to rates of return on average net fixed assets of 2% in 1983
growing to 5% in 1986 and 6% by 1988; the latter being the original objec-
tive Section 4.08 of of Loan 1836-KO (Seventh Railway Project) for 1983.
These rates of return would be achieved by the following measures:
(a)  selective annual increases in passenger and freight tariffs
averaging 1% p.a. in real terms;
(b)  progressive application of cost-based tariffs especially for coal
and cement (paras. 6.09-6.12);
(c)  reductions and postponements in the investment program amounting
to 35% of the investments included in the original Fifth Five Year
Plan (1982-86); these include reductions in motive power and
rolling stocks and postponement of a major signalling investment
on the Seoul-Busan line pending results of a feasibility study in
this corridor; and
(d)  improvement of KNR's efficiency by management actions such as:
stringent control over increase in staff; discontinuation of
certain uneconomic lines, stations and training; disposal of
subsidiary activities; and technical innovations.
6.07       On the basis of the above measures and agreed reduced traffic
forecasts, KNRs summarized financial statements over 1982-91 have been
prepared as shown in Tables 6.1 to 6.4. While reaching the rates of return
given above, KNR would only generate a net profit for 1986. Even in that
year it would need cash subsidies to cover its debt service. KNR's working
capital would improve from a negative W 93 billion at the end of 1982 to 0
by the end of 1986 and reach a positive W 95 billion by the end of 1988.
This would also be the first year at the end of which KNR could reach the
1.5 ratio of current assets to current liabilities it was to achieve by
December 31, 1983 under the provision of Section 4.05 of Loan Agreement
1836-KO.
6.08      Agreement between the Government and the Bank on a revision of
the financial objectives of Loan 1836-KO along the above lines was reached
at negotiations. The revised targets are reflected in the related covenants
of the proposed Loan Agreement (para. 7.01). In addition assurances were
obtained at negotiations that the Government would agree with the Bank
before undertaking major new railway investments (para. 7.01).
C. Coal and Cement Rail Tariffs
6.09       Rail freight tariffs in general and those for coal and cement in
particular were historically much below costs. Covenants of successive Bank



- 31 -
railway projects emphasized the need to increase freight tariffs in real
terms. This has been done and the following table shows freight tariffs
were increased by 42% in real terms between January 1976 and July 1982.

6.10      Coal tariffs which were lower than other tariffs were raised 55%
in 1981.  As a result of these increases, both coal and cement tariffs
covered 110% of operating costs (including depreciation) and 95% of total
costs (including debt service) as of December 31, 1981. In 1982 the Govern-
ment increased freight tariffs by 4.7% as of July 1 and by an additional 6%
(6% for anthracite coal) effective December 15. The following table shows
end 1982 costs and revenues per ton kilometer for anthracite, bituminous
coal and cement based on KNR-s preliminary results for 1982.

- 32 -
6.11      Coal and cement tariffs as of December 31, 1982 covered operating
costs but only 98% and 94% of full cost respectively. At negotiations it
was agreed that the full cost coverage will be reached by July 1, 1984 for
coal and by January 1, 1985 for cement and maintained thereafter (para.
7.01). Under present cost projections, coal tariffs as of December 31, 1982
would have to be increased by 14% (i.e. 4.5% every 6 months starting July 1,
1983) and cement tariffs by 24% (i.e. 5.5% every 6 months starting July 1,
1983). These increases include inflation projected at 5% per annum. They
will most likely be lessened as a result of the decrease in KNR's operating
cost which can be anticipated following the recent worldwide decrease in
petroleum product prices.
6.12      KNR applies identical rates for transporting bagged and bulk
cement although costs for transporting bagged cement are higher than for
bulk (para. 3.08), because the turnaround time for box cars used for
carrying bagged cement is longer than for bulk cement tank cars. In addi-
tion to preventing KNR from incurring losses on transport of bagged cement,
the introduction of a new full cost covering rate for bagged cement would
induce the cement industry to increase the more economic transport in bulk.
The measure should consequently be applied as soon as KNR has the cement
tank cars required to meet demand. Agreement that the measure will be
implemented by January 1, 1985 was reached at negotiations (para. 7.01).
The new tariff will cover full costs as its implementation will coincide
with the agreed date for such coverage.
D. Coal Terminals in Ports
6.13        KMPA does not intend to operate the Incheon and Ulsan ports cQal
terminals itself but to lease them to third parties who will operate them on
its behalf.  While no final decision has been taken, it is likely that each
terminal will be leased to a Terminal Operating Company (TOC). Each TOC
would be established under terms and conditions similar to those agreed
under the Second Ports Project (Loan 1401-KO) for the port of Busan. Agree-
ment on this or on alternative arrangements for operating the terminals
should be reached at negotiations (para. 7.01).
6.14        Detailed calculations available in the project file show that if
KMPA had operated the Incheon and Ulsan terminals on its own, the terminals
would have had to generate rates of return on average net fixed assets in
use revalued annually of 5% and 8%, respectively, to meet their need for
funds in 1986 (the first year of operation), and generate adequate profits
thereafter. KMPA should charge annually the future operators (a) the above
rates of return; (b) rental fees equivalent at least to the annual provision
for depreciation of the terminals' assets, including annual additions,
revalued annually and (c) administrative costs incurred by KMPA for super-
vising the activities of the TOC's. Detailed calculations of the fees to be
paid by the Incheon and Ulsan TOC-s (or alternative operating units) under



- 33 -
these conditions are given in Tables 6.6 (Incheon) and 6.8 (Ulsan). Agree-
ment on the method of calculating these fees should be reached at negotia-
tions. This agreement should necessarily cover the above-mentioned rates of
return on average net fixed assets in use (para. 7.01).
6.15        Tables 6.7 (Incheon) and 6.9 (Ulsan) show projected income
statements and sources and applications of funds for each of the terminals
assuming that (a) each TOC (or alternative operator) would pay KMPA the fees
calculated as above, and (b) KMPA would finance from these fees annual
renewals or additional assets and service debts contracted for building/
acquiring assets. The tables show that KMPA would earn a substantial net
profit of Won 5 billion ($6.7 million equivalent) and W 8.2 billion ($11
million equivalent) in cash on the leasing of the Incheon terminal over
1982-86. The leasing of the smaller Ulsan coal terminal would still
generate net profits of W 1.3 billion ($2.1 million equivalent) and
W 0.6 billion (US$0.8 million equivalent) in cash over the same period. The
financial viability of the two terminals is clearly demonstrated by these
results.
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreement was reached or assurances
obtained on the following:
(a) Conditions of Effectiveness
(i) signing of subsidiary loan agreement between the
Borrower and KNR (para. 4.16); and

(paras. 6.06 and 6.08);
(ix) Government commitment to agree with the Bank prior to
undertaking major new railway investments (para. 6.08);

KOREA
COAL AND CEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Railway Investments
A. Electrification of the Jecheon Yeongju Section of
the Jung Ang Line (64 km)
1.        Presently KNR has 428 km of lines (935.5 km of track) electrified,
including 98 km of line (316.5 km of track) in the Seoul metropolitan area.
The Taebaeg line is electrified from Jecheon to Baegsan (106.7 km), the
Jeongdong line from Cheolam to Bugpyeong (62.6 km) and the Jung Ang line
form Cheongryangri (Seoul area) to Jecheon (160.1 km). The system used is
25 KV AC, with technology from Europe and Japan.
2.        Past electrification programs were justified mainly by the added
capacity generated, and to a lesser extent by reduced operating costs. In
Korea, as in other countries, locomotive maintenance is cheaper with
electrics than with diesels. On the other hand, energy cost savings were
minimal in Korea because most of the electricity was produced by oil-fired
power units. In recent years, however, nuclear power generation has
accounted for a greater percentage of the total and coal fired stations
are now being built. This shift in electric generation sources, combined
with the increased cost of oil and diesel fuel, results in significant
energy cost savings for electric traction compared with diesel traction.
3.        The 64 km portion of the Jung Ang line to be electrified under the
project has several sections where capacity is becoming a problem. For the
level of traffic expected in 1986, line capacity will have to be increased.
The mountainous terrain makes it very expensive to double the track, and
electrification would provide the needed capacity at lower costs, while also
reducing operating costs, and increasing the utilization of the existing
electric locomotive fleet.
B. Signalling: CTC on the Taebaeg Line
4.        The Taebaeg line has presently a very dense freight and passenger
traffic, showing a constant increase over the years. This trend is expected
to continue in the future. Signalling is provided by an interlocking system
and the main lines in the stations are equipped with track circuits. There
are no intermediate signals between stations.



- 36 -                       ANNEX 1
Page 2 of 4
5.        To provide the added capacity needed in some sections of the
line, Centralized Traffic Control (CTC) is to be installed on 126.8 km of
track, between Jecheon and Cheolam. /1 In addition to the increased
capacity resulting from a better scheduling of train crossings and from a
reduction of time lost during meets, CTC allows trains to be dispatched in
sequence, without waiting for completely liberated track. Manpower in
stations is also reduced with this improved signalling technique.
C. Su-In Line
6.        In the past, the port of Incheon was linked by a narrow gauge rail
line to Suweon, about 50 km south-east, on the Seoul-Busan main line.
Incheon was also linked to Seoul by a standard gauge line, which was later
doubled. Since Seoul is linked to Busan by a standard gauge double track,
rail capacity was adequate in this northwestern part of the country and the
narrow gauge line Suweon-Incheon (the SurIn line) became redundant.  Rails
were lifted in the! port area and presently only four daily passenger trains
are operated between Suweon and Songdo (10 km from Incheon), the end of the
line.
7.        Over the years, however, traffic built up and urbanization of
both Seoul and Incheon increased enormously. In addition to a sizeable
freight traffic, the Incheon-Seoul line is saturated with commuter trains
which often run at full capacity. The line east of Seoul (the single track
Jung Ang line) also carries a very high traffic and is close to saturation.
To increase track capacity in the Incheon - Seoul - Jecheon corridor,
already electrified and equipped with CTC, double tracking would be needed,
at a very high cost.
8.         In order to cope with the increased traffic projected for the port
of Incheon, and to transport imported coal as a substitute for oil to the
cement plants in the Jecheon area, another solution had to be found. First,
the whole coal import pattern was examined in order to see whether other
ports could relieve Incheon. The result of this study showed that, although
Ulsan should contribute, Incheon was the most economical port of entry for
/1 Cheolam is actually on the Yeongdong line, 4.3 km south of the junction
with the Taebaeg line at Baegsan. Cheolam is the main coal forwarding
station and the end of the electrified line.



- 37 -                       ANNEX 1
Page 3 of 4
about two thirds of the imported coal due for the Jecheon area cement
plants. For the volumes at hand and the transport distance involved, rail
is clearly the most economical transport mode.
9.         In addition, the Bugog area is being developed and a freight
terminal with a capacity of 10 million tons per year is being built. Bugog
is located south of Seoul, on the Seoul-Busan main line, and is only 8 km
north of Suweon. Bugog is scheduled to be an important destination for both
domestic and imported anthracite coal and for some imported bituminous coal
for industry. Therefore, a study was made of the feasibility of broadening
the Su-In line to standard gauge, reconnecting it to Incheon port where a
new coal terminal is being built, and using it for coal traffic to the
Jecheon area via Cheonan and Jochiweon. Although this route is longer, the
transportation scheme would be attractive because the utilization of the
coal cars would be improved. Domestic coal cars coming from the Taebaeg
region would be unloaded in the Seoul area (including Bugog) and about 15%
of them would travel empty to nearby Incheon, be loaded with imported coal
and transport it to the cement plants near the Taebaeg mines. The economic
evaluation showed that this scheme was feasible and the Government decided
to include the broadening of the Su-In line in its 1982-1986 Five-Year
Investment Plan.
10.       The new standard gauge Su-In line would follow the existing narrow
gauge alignment for most of the distance, except for local realignments
justified by the need to provide easier curves for standard gauge rolling
stock. A preliminary engineering study completed in December 1981
estimated the cost of this project at W 88.4 billion, including the cost of
land and buildings, and the connection to the Incheon coal terminal. Final
engineering is presently under way and will be available before negotiations.
D. Specialized Freight Cars
11.       As mentioned in paragraphs 3.08 and 5.09, operational and
economic reasons indicate that more cement should be transported in bulk in
tank cars rather than in bags in box cars. Presently, KNR operates a fleet
of 520 cement tank cars, of which 254 are owned by the cement producers.
About 38% of the cement transported by KNR is in bulk.
12.       Cement tank cars are in great shortage, and all plant managers
contacted by the mission complained about this situation. Utilization of
the tank cars is extremely good with a turnaround time of only three days,
compared with five for box cars which have more time-consuming loading and
unloading operations. KNR has therefore decided to progressively increase
the percentage of bulk cement transport to 40% in 1982, 43% in 1983, 45% in



-38 -                        ANNEX I
Page 4 of 4
1984, 49% in 1985 and 52% in 1986. A total of 320 cars will therefore be
purchased under the project at an estimated unit cost of $68,500.
13.       For coal, the situation is somewhat similar.  Part of it is
transported in specialized hopper cars, which provide for speedy unloading
when the customers: have adequate receiving facilities (elevated tracks and
conveyor belt evacuation systems). The rest of the coal is transported in
ordinary gondolas, for which the unloading operation is more time-consuming,
whether done with mechanical shovels or manually. KNR is progressively
increasing its fletet of specialized hopper cars, in line with the provision
of more unloading facilities by its customers. A total of 261 coal cars
will be purchased under the project, at an estimated unit cost of $66,700.
14.       Coal can also be transported in special gondolas equipped with
pneumatic cylinders for unloading. Air is provided by the train braking
system. With thesie "side-dumpers", there is no need for elevated tracks at
the receiving end so that they can be used almost anywhere. This type of
cars has never beetn used in Korea, but 50 will be purchased under the
project, on a tria,l basis. If they prove successful, more side-dumpers
would be purchased toward the end of the project period, instead of hopper
cars.

COAL AND CEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Port Investments
A. Incheon Port Coal Terminal
1.        Incheon, Korea's second largest port after Busan, is situated west
of Seoul on the Yellow Sea. This location experiences very high tidal
variations, thus the port is divided into a tidal basin with two locks,
south harbour and an outer harbour. Most of the berthing facilities are
located within the tidal basin which contains 5,420 m of quay capable of
berthing 30 ships of sizes ranging between 2,000 to 50,000 DWT. It also
contains some wharves with floating ramps for small vessels. The south
harbour contains a 300 m wharf which is currently utilized for coal handling
from lighters. The outer harbour is mainly used for small vessels. Transit
sheds, storage warehouses and open storage areas are adequate. Power, water
supply, and waste disposal systems are adequate and so are telecommunications.
2.        The tide is semi-diurnal with an average range between mean high
and low water of 5.70 meters and a spring tidal range of about 8 meters.
The approach consists of two navigable paths, the east channel and the west
channel. Both channels can allow ships to pass, with the west channel more
favorable for ships as large as 100,000 DWT, during the high water cycle of
the tides. Tidal currents in the approach channel reach 2.0 m/sec and a
significant wave height of 1.3 m.
3.        The proposed project with its jetty outside the tidal basin
consists of: (Map 16954)
(i)  construction, started in 1980, of a 240 m coal jetty and
mooring dolphins with an alongside depth of 16.0 m below
MLW capable of accommodating a 100,000 DWT bulk carrier.
Also construction of a 14 m wide, 519 m long trestle,
connecting the jetty to the land, capable of carrying two
conveyor belts and a 6.0 m roadway;
(ii) reclamation of the area required for stockpile yard and
other services;
(iii) construction of a seawall and retaining wall around the
reclaimed stockpile and service area;
(iv) construction of the required auxiliary buildings, and
extension of the railway tracks to the stockpile area,
the required shunting yard, and pavements;

4.        Ulsan port: is situated at the estuary of the Taehwa River within the
Bay of Ulsan at the southeastern extremity of the Korean peninsula. It is
only 37 km north of Korea's main port of Busan. This port serves primarily
the petrochemical industry in the area with 16 berths totalling 2,348 m. Two
of the berths can handle 40,000 DWT ships, the rest handle ships of 1,000 to
20,000 DWT. Transit: sheds, storage warehouses, and open storage areas are
adequate. Power, water supply, waste disposal, and telecommunication systems
are adequate.
5.        The tide iis semi-diurnal with an average range between mean high and
low water of 0.3 m and a spring range of 0.5 m. The approach channel has a
depth of 12 meters allowing passage of vessels up to 40,000 DWT.
6.        The proposed project consists of:  (Map 16955)
(i)  construction, started in 1980 of a 270 m coal pier, extending
from the eastern extremity of pier no. 1 north of the port
with an alongside depth of 12.0 m below MLW capable of
accommodating a 40,000 DWT bulk carrier;
(ii) preparation of the area required for stockpile and the
rest of the facilities required for the terminal;
(iii) construction of the required auxiliary buildings and
pavements and extension of the rail tracks to the stockpile
area with the required shunting yard;
(iv)  procurement of coal handling equipment.

KOREA
COAL AND CEMENT DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Studies
Seoul Metropolitan Region (Gyeonggi-do) Integrated Transport Study
1.        This study is part of a set of three aimed at preparing future
multimodal Transport Projects. The two other are the Seoul Pusan Transport
Corridor Study started in March 1983 and the South Eastern Coast Industrial
Belt study due to start in 1984. The first of these studies will be
financed from Loan 1836-KO (Seventh Railway Project). The second will
likely be part of the forthcoming Highway Sector Project and financed from
the relevant Bank loan.
2.        The Gyeonggi-do study, estimated to cost US$1.6 million, was to be
funded entirely under the Seventh Railway Project (Loan 1836-KO); but at the
request of government US$.6 million of this amount will be funded under the
present Coal and Cement Project to allow all urban studies, including the
feasibility of Secondary Cities transport improvements, to be started
earlier under funding from the Seventh Railway Project. The Seoul Region
Transport Study has objectives to (a) assess multimodal transport require-
ments (rail, roads, ports, airports) in the area; and (b) conduct feasibil-
ity studies of selected capacity increase investments.

Note:  This table does not include bituminous and steam coal which will be
imported by the steel mill and the coal-fired power plants since these
are located on the seashore and have their owqn ports. For anthracite
the table only covers needs for briquettes. Small amounts will continue
to be imported for the existing power plants at Busan and Masan. In
addition, coastal shipping from Mukho of about 1.7 million tons p.a. of
domestic anthracite will continue to Ulsan, Mogpo and other ports.

Assumptions:  Anthracite distribution is based on 1981 briquette consumption;
assuming that briquette consumption will decrease by about 30% in
Seoul and in Gyeonggi Province, and remain at its 1981 level in
other areas. Modal allocation assumes for 1986: 1/3 of Seoul City
and 402 of Gyeonggi served by Bugog and using the Su-In Line. For
1991, 50% of Gyeonggi served from Bugog.
Bituminous distribution is based on the number of industrial boil-
ers in 1981 suitable for conversion to coal. The hypothesis is
that 40-50% of boilers will be converted to coal by 1991.
