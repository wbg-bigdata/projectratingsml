INTE.RNATIONAL DEVELORPTNT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOAMENDATION CF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PRCPOSED CREDIT TO JORDAN
FOR AN EDUCATICN PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Credit to Jordan for the equivalent of US $5.4 million on standard IDA
terms to help finance an education project.
PART I - INTRODUCTION
2.        The proposed Credit would be the sixth Bank Group operation in
Jordan, which were all financed by IDA credits, and the first for educa-
tion. Bank Group lending to Jordan began in 1961. It was interrupted by
the Arab-Israeli war of 1967 and the disturbances that followed, and the
projects then under consideration, including in particular a large scheme
for the extraction of potash from the Dead Sea, were put in abeyance. A
number of new projects were identified by a mission in early 1969. The
first of these, the Highway Project (Credit 262-JO) was approved by the
Association in June 1971 and would be followed by the education project
now being proposed.
3.        A summary statement of IDA credits to Jordan is attached as
Annex I. The Government's ability to carry out projects in an orderly
way has been seriously affected by the unstable security situation with-
in the country resulting frcm the 1967 war and the civil disorders parti-
cularly in 1970/71. In the case of the Agricultural Credit Corporation,
which received two IDA credits (Nos. 44-JO and 103-JO), the rate of lend-
ing and the collection of arrears deteriorated sharply necessitating a
postponement of the Closing Date of the second credit. However, there
has recently been a slight improvement. Action taken by the Government
to ensure security in the Jordan Valley, where the bulk of agricultural
activity takes place, and the above average harvest in 1971 have improved
the chances of loan recoveries by the Corporation. The situation remains
precarious however since any renewal of hostilities along the Arab-Israeli
cease-fire line would bring about an immediate setback. Performance under
the two Water Supply Projects (Credits 18-JO and 43-JO), although they
were slow to be completed, is satisfactory on the whole. IFC has not made
any investments in Jordan and has no operations under consideration at
present.



4.        The uncertain political situation in the Middle East, parti-
cularly as this affects Jordan, and the dependence of the Jordan econamy
on substantial amounts of external grant aid, make planning ahead diffi-
cult, especially in the long term. Under these circumstances, develop-
ment strategy in Jordan calls for the choice of development projects which
would help to relieve the immediate economic problems and at the same
time benefit long-term development needs whatever the evolution of the
political situation. Serious attention should be given to development
priorities in order to make the most of the limited domestic financial
resources and to ensure that foreign aid should be channeled to the pre-
paration and execution of projects that fit the above strategy. Due to
the prevailing uncertainties, identification and preparation by the
Government of economically viable projects has often been inadequate.
Efforts are now being made, however, by the National Planning Council with
the advice of the Bank and with technical assistance provided by UNDP, to
draw up a medium term plan which would provide the basis for further de-
velopment.
5.        The proposed project meets the above criterion.  The education
system in Jordan suffers from a number of deficiencies arising from un-
controlled expansion of primary and secondary enrollment in the past with-
out corresponding increases in physical facilities and teaching staff and
without adequate consideration of the country's priority requirements for
vocational education and training. The project aims at redressing the
present imbalance between academic and vocational education and thus, at
the same time, to improve employment qualifications of students and help
to meet Jordan's manpower needs. Other high priority projects in the
fields of water supply and power generation, which were identified by the
Bank economic mission in 1969, are currently under consideration for financ-
ing by the Association. The preliminary findings of an economic mission
which visited Jordan in 1971 show that there is potential for development,
particularly in the field of agriculture and the mission has tentatively
identified a number of areas where further investigations are warranted.
6.        The proposed project was first identified by a Bank/UNESCO
mission which visited Jordan in February 1970 and was prepared by the
Oowerxment with UNESCO assistance.  Appraisal was delayed by the civil
disordser in Jordan and finally took place in May/June 1971. Negotiations
were held in Washington in December 1971. The Borrower's delegation was
headed by Dr. Ishaq Farhan, Minister of Education, and included representa-
tiven '"'f bbc. MUi: k ;f' Z-i7iw.1atton. and the National Planning Council.



PART II - THE ECONGMY
7.        An updating memorandum dated May 21, 1971 on the Current Economic
Position and Prospects of Jordan (EMA4.37a) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on June 7, 1971 (IDA/R7-41). An economic mission visited Jordan
in December 1971 and is presently preparing its report. A Basic Data Sheet
is attached as Annex II.
8.        Following the civil war in Jordan between the armed forces and
the Palestinian guerillas in September 1970, and the action taken by the
army against the guerillas last summer, the Government has now reestab-
lished its control throughout the Kingdom. Since then, the authorities
have concentrated on the task of repairing the war damage, harpered only
by occasional anti-government gestures, to which the Government has res-
ponded firmly.
9.        The Government's success in reestablishing its authority and
control over the country was achieved at the expense of further isolation
of Jordan in the Arab world. The elimination of the guerillas not only
cost Jordan financial support from Libya and Kuwait, but also led to the
closure of the Syrian border to Jordanian trade. This latter action has
had repercussions on the economy of Jordan as the vast majority of Jordanian
exports and imports passed through Syria. Recent reports however suggest
that Syria may consider reopening the border.
10.       From 1959 to the eve of the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 the Jordanian
economy grew at around 8-10 percent per year. Per capita GNP rose from
$208 in 1961 to $260 in 1966, an average increase of over 4.5 percent per
year. Substantial price stability prevailed over this period and, as a
result of considerable foreign assistance, a surplus in the balance of pay-
ments was maintained. The Government made every effort to increase domes-
tic revenues and a complete phasing out of foreign budget support was ex-
pected by the mid-seventies, when all foreign aid was to be channeled to
development projects. The growth of exports and invisibles promised
further improvements in the balance of payments position. Although con-
tinued external assistance w-Tas required, the prospects for sustained
and effective development were good.
U.        The loss of the West Bank in 1967 severely curtailed the growth
of the most promising sectors such as agriculture, tourism and industry;
and the consequent inflow of refugees to the East Bank created a severe
strain on employment opportunities, on current budget expenditures and
urban infrastructure needs. Only large infusions of Arab aid (under the
Khartoum Agreement of August 1967) made an extremely difficult budgetary
and balance of payments position manageable. In 1968, poor climatic con-
ditions severely reduced agricultural production, while increased militancy
on the part of the Palestinian guerillas inhibited industrial growth.



In 1969, however, the economy recovered from the setback of the previous
year as exceptionally good climatic conditions resulted in increased agri-
cultural production, and private investment and construction activity
recovered to 1966-67 levels. The civil disturbances of July 1970 and
subsequently the civil war in September 1970 put a halt to the brief ex-
pansion which had continued into the first half of 1970. The cumulative
effect of these events was to leave the economy in 1970 at about the same
levels of production as in 1967, but with considerably depleted resources.
12.     In the first half of 1971 there was substantial growth in the
economy although investment did not increase as rapidly as other economic
indicators.  A complete recovery to the 1969 levels, however, has not been
possible due to the closure of the Syrian border. In 1971 the deficit in
the government budget is estimated at $42 million, equivalent to 18 percent
of cumulative government expenditure over the same period. To meet its
obligations the Government has resorted to extensive borrowing from the
banking sector.  The financing of the budget deficit, chronic since 1967,
poses a major threat to the economic stability of the country which so far
has experienced relative price stability despite a rapid increase in money
supply. Very stringent budgetary policies are needed to cope with this
situation. On the balance of payments side, large deficits have resulted
from declining revenues from exports, invisibles and transfers.  In 1971,
the current account deficit is estimated at $42 million while overall the
deficit on the balance of payments was $17 million. In view of the
special nature of the decline in export revenues, Jordan received $4.5
million in compensatory financing from the fIF in 1971. Foreign exchange
reserves, reflecting the tight payments position, declined but stood still
at $246.4 million at the end of November 1971, equivalent to about 16
months of imports at 1969 levels.
13.     In spite of short-run difficulties, there are indications that
Jordan is now facing up to the medium and long-term problems. The most
positive sign of this is the decision to draw up a three-year plan. This
exercise is well under way and a final document should be available in
the spring. The importance attached by the Jordanian authorities to the
plan is reflected in the decision to make available to the planning
authority an impressive array of technicians from all economic ministries.
The planning exercise will help the Government to establish its medium-
term investment priorities, and contribute to the rationalization of the
decision making process.
1h.     External public debt outstanding at the end of the third quarter
of 1971 amounted to about $142 million or some $30 million more than at
the end of 1970. Partly as a result of this increase in debt, but also
because of declining export earnings, debt service as a percentage of
exports and gross invisibles has increased from around 2.8 in 1970 to
around 8.5 in 1971. In view of Jordan's limited ability to service external
debt, the limited resources available for development in relation to those
needed to achieve a moderate rate of growth, the low per capita incorme,
Jordan requires substantial and continued external assistance which slhould
be obtained so far as possible on concessional terms.



- 5 -
PART III - THE EDUCATION SECTOR
15.       The education system of Jordan is based on a pattern of 6 years
of primary education, 3 years of preparatory education and 3 years of
secondary education, followed by university and other post secondary
cources, varying in length from 2 to 6 years. Primary and preparatory
education is free and compulsory. In 1970/71 the enrollment in primary
schools was 422,000 or 90 percent of the relevant age group, while prepa-
ratory and secondary school enrollment amounted to 111,000 or 67 percent
and 52,000 or 35 percent of the relevant age groups respectively. In 1970
a total of 6,500 students were enrolled in the University of Jordan and
other post secondary education institutions, compared with saoe 241,000 who
were pursuing higher education abroad.
16,       The Ministry of Education (MOE) has overall responsibility for
primary, preparatory and secondary education, although the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) operates some schools exclusively for
Palestinian Refugees, and some are privately run. The MOE also operates
three training institutions for primary and prop&ratory fthool teachers, and
a fourth is operated by UNRWA. The University of Jordan is an autonomous
institution and receives Government and other grants.
17.       In 1970 the MOE provided 56 percent of national educational ex-
penditures. Other ministries accounted for 10 percent and local authori-
ties for 5 percent. The remaining 29 percent was shared by UNRWA (19 per-
cent) and private sources (10 percent). The ccntribution of the MOE is
entirely spent on government schools at primary, preparatory and secondary
levels, for which the Ministry is directly responsible. Another part of
the costs of these schools is covered by local authorities and UNRWA.
UNRWA thus contributes to the Jordan educational system in two ways, namely
by operating its own schools for refugees and by paying the Jordan Govern-
ment for some refugee children enrolled in MOE schools. Expenditure on
education increased in the ten years prior to 1967 by about 10 percent
annually, and the share of education expenditure in total GNP remained moro
or less constant at 4.5 percent. After 1967 education expenditure patterns
have become difficult to determine but expenditure on education for the
East Bank alone amounted to $24 million equivalent in 1970, representing
6.5 percent of estimated East Bank GNP.



-6-
18.       Although enrollment ratios at primary through secondary levels
are high and the output of the system is numerically impressive, the quality
of education at these levels is deficient. Most teachers are unqualified,
school buildings are unsuitable and basic teaching material is lacking.
The shortage of properly trained primary and preparatory teachers in parti-
cular is a major factor in the poor quality of teaching and a major ob-
stacle preventing the introduction of a more meaningful and diversified
curriculum. Thus the supply of qualified teachers at the primary and the
preparatory levels needs to be improved. At present no facilities exist for
training agricultural and vocational teachers for preparatory schools.
19.       The develcpment of secondary education has been biased in favor
of academic education. oily 9 percent of students are enrolled in vocatio-
nal courses such as commercial, industrial, agricultural and nursing pro-
grams and the remaining 91 percent follow purely academic courses. This
has resulted in a critical shortage of trained manpower in industry, commerce
and agriculture while a growing number of general secondary school graduates
remain unemployed.
20.       Secondary teachers of all types are recruited from graduates of
the University of Jordan and from those returning from training overseas.
The University of Jordan is able to meet the quantitative demand for science
and liberal arts teachers, but it is necessary to improve the quality and
orientation of the secondary teacher training program of the Faculty of
Science. The need for secondary vocational and agricultural teachers is
being met by training abroad.
21.       Present deficiencies in the training of skilled industrial crafts-
men and technicians call for urgent attention. The government plans to
establish a National Vocational Training Council which will help translate
manpower requirements into training programs, develop training standards
and review salary policies for technical personnel. So far the only school
in Jordan for training industrial technicians and craftsmen is operated by
UNRWA.
22.       The Government's educational strategy is to accord top priority
to the task of improving the quality of education by: (i) limiting enroll-
ment expansion to a rate substantially below the growth rate in the recent
past; (ii) increasing the supply of qualified teachers and up-grading teachers
in service; and (iii) diversifying the curricula of both preparatory and
secondary schools to include more vocation-oriented courses. This strategy
is appropriate to tackle the present weaknesses of the education system, and
the proposed project is in direct support of it.

PART IV - TTIE PROJECT
23.       A detailed description of the proposed project is given in the
report entitled "Appraisal of a First Education Project in Jordan" (PE-
36a) dated January 13, 1972 which is being distributed separately. A
Credit and Project Summary is at Annex III. A map showing the location
of project items is also attached. The proposed project would contribute
to the controlled expansion of the secondary and post-secondary educational
system of Jordan, with particular emphasis on technical and vocational edu-
cation, and support teacher training for preparatory and secondary schools,
through the expansion of existing educational facilities and the construc-
tion of new facilities. The project would also contain a substantial tech-
nical assistance component to be financed by the Association and bilateral
and multilateral donors, to cover the training needs of the project. The
main features of the project are given below.
24.       Comprehensive Secondary Schools.  The project would provide
buildings and equipment for two new comprehensive secondary schools which
would represent the first stage in the Government's efforts to introduce
a new form of secondary education. These schools (one for boys and one
for girls) would both be located in Amman and are expected to help correct
the present imbalance between purely academic and vocation-oriented secon-
dary education in favor of the latter. The Government plans to increase
vocational enrollment which, expressed as a percentage of general secon-
dary enrollment, would increase from the present low level of 9 percent to
30 percent by 1980. New construction at the secondary level has the added
advantage of replacing existing unsuitable rented accommodation. The girls'
secondary school would contribute to women's participation in the labor
force. The enrollment in the proposed schools (1,000 students in each
school) would be about equally divided among arts, science, and vocational
education. The two schools together would graduate 610 students per year.
University graduates, of which there is an adequate supply at present, would
be recruited to teach in these two institutions.
25.       Polytechnic and Trade Training Center.  The proposed project would
finance the construction and equipment of a Polytechnic and Trade Training
Center at Marka with boarding facilities for about 35 percent of the total
enrollment of 755 students. A small manufacturing unit would be attached
to the Center for the production of prototype scientific equipment for use
in secondary schools. The Polytechnic would offer two-year post-secondary
full-time courses leading either to further training or to direct employment
at middle-technician level in architecture, building and engineering (its
technician output would be 190 per year). In addition courses would also
be offered for the training of technical instructors (20 per year) for
employment in preparatory schools. The Trade Training Center would offer
one and two-year post-preparatory full-time courses leading to direct



-8-
eniploymint at Cie    .    erel. Graruptes frwv i;he Trade Training Center
(167 per year) are expected to reach supervisory or lower-technician
positions. The facilities of the Polytechnic and 'rrade Training Center
would also be used for evening classes covering a wide range of subjects
appropriate to the needs of those already employed in the area.
26.        Teacher Training College.  It is proposed to build and equip
a co-educational primary and preparatory teacher training college located
at Salt with a total enrollment of 700 students.  Residential facilities
would be provided for 420 students. Graduates from the college (320 per year)
are expected to teach aIl subjects at the primary level and specialized
subjects at the preparatory level and would thus help to meet the need for
additional qualified teachers at these levels.
27.        Agricultural Teacher Training Extension.  The project provides
for the expansion of an existing agricultural school in Shaubak for the
training of agricultural teachers for preparatory schools through a two-
year post-secondary teacher training program for about 60 students. Be-
sides meeting the needs of the preparatory schools, the graduate teachers
are expected to assist in extension work, thus bridging the gap between
agricultural education and the extension service.
28.        Technical Assistance.  In view of the importance of the proposed
project in bringing-about a reorientation of the education system in Jordan
through the introducation of comprehensive secondary education and the sig-
nificant expansion of technical and vocational training, technical assis-
tance financing amounting to about $380,000 would be provided by the Asso-
ciation out of the proceeds of the credit and a further $1.2 million would
be provided by other external sources. Assurances have been received by
the Jordan Government from the UNDP (and ILO who would act as executing
agents for UNDP) and the British Overseas Development Administration (O.D.A.)
covering the latter amount,which would be used for the specialists and
fellowships required for the Polytechnic and Trade Training Center. The
Association would finance the technical assistance requirements for the two
comprehensive secondary schools, the teacher training college, education
planning and the Project Unit. In the event that the UNDP or OVA techni-
cal assistance contributions do not materialize, the Jordan Government has
agreed to finance any shortfall.
29.        Project Administration.  A Project Unit has already been estab-
lished within the Ministry of Education to supervise project implementatiorn5
to coordinate activities related to the project within the Government, with
private bodies and with the Architectural Consultants which would be appointed
for design work and supervision of contractors, and to provide liaison with
the Association. The staff of the unit would consist of a qualified and
experienced Director and Architect acceptable to the Association, a qualified



- 9 -
and experienced Accountant and Procurement Specialist, to be appointed
after consultation with the Association. All staff would be employed
on a full time basis.
30.       Educational Planning and Coordination.  There is a need in Jordan
to improve the panning of education in order to ensure that the education
system is best adapted to the manpower requirements of the country and at
the same time to bring about better coordination between the various Govern-
ment ministries, agencies and other institutions concerned with implementation
in specific areas such as agricultural education and teacher training. Under
the draft Credit Agreement the following steps would be taken by the Jordan
Government:
(a) An Education Planning Committee would be established within
the Ministry of Education whose membership would include the
Minister of Education, the Heads of Primary and Secondary
Education, an Educational Planner (or Planners) to be pro-
vided through technical assistance as part of the project,
and a representative of the National Planning Council.
(b) The Jordan Board of Education would set up a Teacher Training
Committee including the Dean of the Faculty of Science and
the Head of the Department of Education of the University of
Jordan, the Project Manager of the existing UNDP/UNESCO assis-
ted teacher training program and the Head of the Teacher
Training Department of the Ministry of Education.
(c) A Coordinating Committee for Agricultural Education including
officials of the Ministries of Education and Agriculture, the
National Planning Council and the University of Jordan would
be established.
(d) A National Vocational Council would be established with a
Vocational Education and Training Department as its executive
arm. Membership of the Council, for which plans have already
been made, will include representatives of public and private
industries, educational institutions and concerned trade
unions. Representatives of the National Vocational Council,
public and private industries and educational institutions
would also be appointed to an Advisory Council to be estab-
lished for the Polytechnic and Trade Training Center.
(e) To enable the Government and the Association to assess the suc-
cess of the proposed project in attaining its objectives, the
Government has agreed to put into effect a "tracer system" for
all project institutions and for a limited number of tradition-
al secondary schools, which would record all relevent infor-
mation concerning premature termination of education, repetition,
employment and advanced studies of graduates.



- 10 -
31.       Cost Estimates and Financing Plan.  The total cost of the project
is estimated at $9.8 ii9Eon. Wa's'-fotal ~fincludes $1.2 million in techni-
cal assistance for the Polytechnic and Trade Training Center (see paragraph
28 above) expected to be financed by the UNDP and MDA. Of the remaining
$8.6 million for construction, furniture, equipment and other technical
assistance, the proposed IDA credit would finance $5.4 million, correspond-
ing to the estimated foreign exchange component of these items. The Governr-
ment would finance the $3.2 million equivalent in local expenditures. The
recurrent expenditures connected with the project, to be financed by the
Government, are estimated at $0.7 million equivalent a year. The project
cost estimates have been adjusted to take account of the expected effect
of recent currency realignments.
32.       Procurement.  All contracts for the supply of furniture, equip-
ment and books and for construction would be awarded on the basis of inter-
national competitive bidding. In bid comparison local manufacturers and
suppliers would be allowed a 15 percent preference or the import duty, which-
ever is the lower. However, it is unlikely that the local furniture indus-
try would be competitive and furniture contracts are likely to be awarded
to foreign suppliers. Except for furniture and equipment, the project wTill.
probably not attract many foreign bidders. The number and quality of local
general contractors is adequate to carry out construction work under the
project.
33.       Disbursement.  The credit would be disbursed against the CIF
costs of imported furniture and equipment, or 75 percent of the cost of
these items if procured locally, the foreign exchange cost of consultants'
services and technical assistance and 45 percent of the cost of civil works
contracts, representing the estimated foreign exchange component.
PART V - LEGAL INSThURENTS AND AUTHORITY
34.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a Resolution approving the proposed credit are being distri-
buted to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Development Credit
Agreement conforms to the normal pattern for credits for education projects.
35.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit Agreement
would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECMENDATION
36.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.
