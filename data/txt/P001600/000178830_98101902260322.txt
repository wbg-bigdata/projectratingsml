REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALAWI FOR A
KARONGA RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - PHASE II
1.        I submit the 17ollowing report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Malawi, for the equivalent of US$9.2 mill[on on
standard Third Window terms of 25 years including 7 years of grace, with
interest at 4.85%, to help finance the second phase of the Karonga Rural
Development Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled Recent Economic Development and Prospects of
Malawi (No. 560a-MAI) weLs distributed to the Executive Directors on
January 14, 1975. An updating economic mission visited Malawi in November/
December 1975 and its report will be distributed shortly. Country data
are provided in Annex I.
3.        When it attained Independence in 1964, Malawi was the poorest of
the three territories of the former Central African Fe Ieration. W4ith a popu-
lation of about 5 million and a land area of 93,000 km , it is among the
countries with the highest population density in Africa.   Its main natural
assets are moderately fertile soils, good water resources and a cLimate
favorable to crop production. Unlike its neighbors, Malawi has no substan-
tial mineral resources and had attracted little outside interest. Forests
constitute the main, essentially unused, resource which could be exploited
on a significant scale in the future. At Independence, infrastructure
was undeveloped. The tax base was very small and government revenues had
to be supplemented with British budgetary aid to support the smalL adminis-
tration. Prospects for economic development were generally regarded as
bleak.
4.        Measured against its poor natural endowments, progress since 1964
has been remarkable. Between 1964 and 1975, GDP at constant prices grew at
an average annual rate of 7.5 percent, domestic investment and savings in-
creased rapidly, and government finances have improved sufficientLy to
eliminate the need for budgetary aid. Agriculture -- which dominates
the economy and contributed 45 percent of GDP in 1975 -- has been directed
towards export markets by encouraging cash crop estates production and
through integrated rural. development schemes. Diversification has been
promoted. In addition, rapid industrial development (the share of industry
rose from 9 percent of (;DP in 1964 to 14 percent in 1975) has significantly
broadened the economic base.   Despite this economic improvement, however,
Malawi still has a GNP per capita of only $110 and is listed by the United
Nations among the 25 poorest countries.
This document has a restricted distribution and may be used by recipients only in the performance
of their official duties. Its contents may not otherwise be disclosed without World Bank authorization.



5.        Malawi's success has been the result of realistic and purposeful
pLanning by the Government. In 1971, a Statement of Development Policies
(DEVPOL) was pubLishied which provides a general framework within which
thie Government operates a three-year rolling plan. DEVPOL contains
guidelines for major economic indicators up to 1980 and states the main
socio-economic objectives, among which are: (a) to raise living standards
and productivity in rural areas; (b) to achieve an average annual growth
of GDP of 8 percent through the parallel development of sma]l holder output,
estate agriculture and industry; (c) to promote a more balanced regional
development; and (d) to develop local initiatives with a gradual increase
of Local. participation in the economy.
6.        DEVPOL reserves an important role for private investment which,
it is anticipated, will account for about half of total fixed capital
formation. The Government recognizes the role of a healthy private sector
in generating foreign exchange and savings needed to sustain other elements
of the development strategy and has incorporated policies into DEVPOL which
are intended to attract foreign investors and to ensure a continued high
growth of the private sector.   Trade and payments policies are liberal,
profit taxes moderate and wages are deliberately held down to favor
labor-intensive estates and industries. Indeed, the modern private sector
has been the leader in economic growth.    The output of estate agriculture
has increased by 10 percent a year in real terms over the past decade and
industrial production has increased by 13 percent a year.
7.        Within the public sector investment program, which will provide
approximately half of total investment, agriculture will receive 19 percent,
public utilities 17 percent, and social services 15 percent. Government
investment in transport infrastructure will be reduced from 37 percent in
the late 1960's to less than 30 percent of total public investment. Malawi
has an effective administration which has been remarkably successful in
preparing and implementing development projects.
8.        Income distribution is relatively favorable in Malawi.     It is
estimated that in 1969 the poorest 40 percent of households received 15
percent of incomes; the highest 20 percent received 53 percent and the
highest 5 percent received 30 percent. Although these figures compare
favorably with those of other development countries, the rapid develop-
ment of estate agriculture and industry has led to some concentration of
profits in relatively few hands. To offset the adverse distributional ef-
fect of the buoyant growth of the modern private sector, the Government has
directed its agricultural investment program towards the smallholders. In-
directly, wage and price policies have reduced the gap between wage earners
and subsistence farmers. Over the last seven years, real wages have fallen
somewhat, while the real earnings of smallholders have risen. Keeping a
firm check on wage increases has also had a beneficial effect on wage
employment. Over the past seven years, total wage employment has increased
by no less than 10 percent a year on the average. About 20 percent of
Malawi's labor force is now engaged in wage employment as compared to 12
percent in 1968.



- 3 -
9.        Since almost 90 percent of the population lives in rural areas,
rural development is a primary social and economic objective. At the moment,
the majority of farmers are smallholders on the fringe of the market economy.
Their staple crop is almost exclusively maize and their principal cash crops
are tobacco and groundnuts. Until now, the principal instrument for increas-
ing smallholder productivity has been relatively intensive integrated devel-
opment projects in specific areas, which at the moment reach about 25 percent
of the rural population.
10.       In spite of tbe Government's efforts, however, the production from
the traditional agricultural sector has lagged behind that of the estate
sector. Although firm figures are lacking, indications are that t:he pro-
duction from the traditional sector has not increased by much more than
3 percent a year over the past decade. The Government is concerned about
this relatively slow growth and is preparing a country-wide approach to
rural development, which would be a departure from the previous discrete
intensive project approach in that it would primarily concentrate on the
provision of farm inputS and extension services. Investments in infrastruc-
ture, which were emphasized in the earlier projects would be less and would
follow at a slower pace. This new approach - the National Rural Development
Program - is to become the Government's chief vehicle for smallholder devel-
opment.
11.       In the past, the generation and use of domestic resources has been
good. Investments grew from 8 percent of GDP in 1964 to 23 percent in 1974.
Domestic savings, which were virtually nil in 1964, financed 60 percent of
total investment in 1974. The Government's budget has been skillfully man-
aged in order to put government finances on a firmer footing. From 1964
to 1974/75, recurrent revenue grew by 14 percent a year on the average,
while the increase in recurrent expenditures was kept down to 8 percent a
year. British budgetary support - which financed K 10 million, or about
one third of the current budget in 1964 - was gradually reduced and was
eliminated entirely in 1972/73. In 1973/74 and 1974/75, small recurrent
budget surpluses of K 1.5 million and K 5 million were attained. At the
same time, the Government's domestic medium and long term borrowing (in the
form of Local Registered Stock) was also stepped up from K 0.1 million in
1964 to K 13.5 million in 1974/75. The financial situation of public corpo-
rations is generally healthy, and part of their surpluses is used to finance
government investment. As a result of the factors mentioned above, the
domestic contribution t:o the financing of development expenditures, which
was negative in 1964, amounted to 45 percent in 1974/75.
12.       Up to 1974, Malawi's balance of payments has shown a healthy devel-
opment. Since 1967, exports have increased by about 7 percent a year in
real terms, while imports have increased by about 6 percent a year in real
terms. The terms of trade, however, have moved somewhat against Malawi.
Payments for services increased substantially but they were partly offset
by increases in workers' remittances from South Africa. The balance of
payments current account deficit increased from $18 million in 1967 to $45



- 4 -
million in 1974.   This deterioration, however,   was more than compensated by
increasing private and public capital inflows. As a result, official inter-
national reserves increased from $22.5 million at the end of 1967 to $81.5
million (4.5 months of imports) at the end of 1974.
13.       Although information is still incomplete, indications are that
Malawi's balance of payments has deteriorated in 1975. The current account
deficit is estimated to have increased from $45 million in 1974 to about
$80 million. Private and public capital inflow did not increase correspond-
ingly, as a result of which international reserves declined from $81.5 million
at the end of 1974 to $61 million at the end of 1975 (2.7 months of imports).
A number of factors have contributed to the deterioration in Malawi's balance
of payments position in 1975. While merchandise exports increased by 13
percent in real terms over 1974, imports increasea by 15 percent. Moreover,
Malawi's terms of trade deteriorated by more than 10 percent in 1975. As a
result, the trade deficit increased from $39 million in 1974 to an estimated
$70 million in 1975, which explains most of the increase in the current
account deficit in that year.
14.       The sharp increase in the volume of import in 1975 was to some
extent due to the political uncertainties in Malawi's neighboring countries
which led Malawian importers to accelerate their imports in order to build
up precautionary stocks. Among domestic factors which may have adversely
affected the balance of payments is the large expansion of credit, which
amounted to 85 percent in 1975. During the first few months of 1976,
Malawi's international reserves have continued to decline. The Government,
after having received in November 1975 the equivalent of $7.2 million
balance of payments support from the IMF (gold tranche and oil facility),
has approached the IMF for a first standby credit.
15.       Notwithstanding the present balance of payments difficulties,
Malawi's longer term prospects for growth and external trade and payments
are sound. Its agricultural products have generally found ready markets,
particularly in the UK and more recently in the USA. Traditional outlets
and Malawi's associate membership in the EEC offer good prospects of
expanding markets for Malawi's exports.    With the substantial expansion
of sugar production that is about to get under way, total exports in
real terms can realistically be expected to grow even faster in the future
(more than 9 percent a year) than in the past decade (about 8 percent a
year).  However, Malawi's terms of trade are likely to show a further
deterioration of about 8 percent over the next five years. On these
assumptions, the current account deficit is projected to increase from
$80 million in 1975 to some $150 million by 1980.
16.       With the increase in the Government's investment program, net
long-term public capital inflow also increased substantially from $17 mil-
lion in 1967 to $37 million in 1974. The sources of public capital inflow
have gradually been diversified. At Independence, the UK was virtually
the only source, but by 1974, the British contribution had declined to less
than 50 percent. International organizations, especially IDA, provided
20 percent and the remainder came from a variety of bilateral sources.
Development grants amounted to about 25 percent of total public capital
inflow. Loan capital was generally made available on concessionary terms.



- 5 -
From 1971 through 1974 total commitments of public loans and grants averaged
$60 million a year.  The average grant element of these commitments was
77 percent.
17.       At the end of 1975, Malawi's external public debt totaled $322
million, of which $239 million had been disbursed. Debt service in 1975
amounted to $12.7 million, equivalent to about 6 percent of earnings from
exports and workers' remittances. At the end of 1975, IDA's share in Malawi's
disbursed debt was 25.8 percent and servicing of IDA credits accounted for 3.0
percent of total debt services. As Malawi's need for external capital is
expected to grow over the next five years or so, the Government may encounter
greater difficulty in borrowing on terms as soft as those it has received in
the past. Debt service is likely to increase, but even if the average grant
eLement of external assistance declines from almost 80 percent in the recent
past to some 60 percent by 1980, the debt service ratio would not increase to
more than 10 percent by 1985. The external capital requirements will continue
to be in excess of the foreign exchange component of projects costs and
external assistance should, therefore, also cover some local costs.
18.       Malawi is considered eligible for Bank lending on Third Window terms
on the basis of the following criteria:
1.   Per Capita Income
In 1972 Malawi's GNP per capita was $100.
2.   Performance
The Government's development effort has been commendable and, over
the last 12 years, has led to an average annual growth rate of 7.5%. A large
part of the Government'-  investment program is directed towards the rural poor.
3.   Ability to Repay
In view of its excellent economic management and thie present and
prospective modest debt burden, Malawi is creditworthy for limited amounts of
Bank lending, but a substantial part of future borrowing should continue to be
on concessionary terms.
4.   Access to Alternative Sources of Finance
Malawi's need for external financial assistance is increasing. It
has, however, no special access to new sources of concessionary finance, and
cannot     prudently afford to borrow substantial sums oD commercial terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAWI
19.       To date thirteen IDA credits amounting to US$96.8 million equi-
valent have been made to Malawi. Six of these credits, representing US$42.6
million (44 percent of total IDA assistance to Malawi), were for projects
in the agricultural sector. The others consist of two credits totaling



- 6 -
US$21.5 million for highways in 1968 and 1974, two credits totaling US$12.8
million for power projects in 1970 and 1973, two credits totaling US$17.9
million to finance education projects in 1967 and 1975, and a US$2 million
credit in 1974 to help finance the preparation of a proposed wood pulp devel-
opment scheme. There have been no Bank loans in Malawi and the first IFC
investment (US$6 million for a textile mill) was made in February 1976.
Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits as of February 29, 1976
and notes on the execution of ongoing projects. Project execution is good.
20.       Bank Group operations in Malawi will continue to emphasize rural
development. We are presently assisting the Government in devising a national
rural development program, for which we expect to recommend Bank Group finan-
cial assistance in FY78 and for which necessary pre-investmnents are included
in the proposed project. A third Power Project was appraised last November/
December and is expected to be submitted to the Executive Directors for
approval in the early part of FY77. A water supply project for the city of
Blantyre is scheduled for appraisal around October 1976. The Bank Group is
also assisting the Government in the preparation of a major pulp development
project, whose total cost has been estimated at over US$300 million equivalent.
Bank financial assistance for this project would be considered if suitable
external guarantees can be obtained.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IN MALAWI
General
21.       Agriculture is the principal sector in the economy of Malawi.     It
accounts for about half of the country's gross domestic product and provides
employment for about 90 percent of the population. Agricultural commodities
account for over 90 percent of the country's export earnings and provide raw
materials for domestic industries. Between 1964 - 1973, agricultural produc-
tion grew at a rate of 6 percent per annum in constant prices and at about
3 percent since 1973 as a result of a combination of poor weather conditions
and reduced use of fertilizers.
22.       Wlhereas maize, pulses and groundnuts are grown throughout the coun-
try, tea and cotton are produced mainly in the south, tobacco in the central
region and rice along the shores of Lake Malawi. Maize is the principal
subsistence crop. Surplus quantities are marketed, some directly to private
traders and the rest to the Agricultural Development and Marketing Corpora-
tion (ADMARC), a parastatal body which also purchases farm inputs in bulk
for smallholders throughout the country and distributes them to farmers
through its depots. The official minimum prices paid by ADMARC to producers
are reviewed annually. They were most recently increased in September 1975
and are presently high enough to maintain the farmers' incentives.
23.       Prior to 1967, the growth of agricultural production was achieved
largely through expansion of cultivated acreage. Increasing scarcity of
suitable land and the large investments required to open up new land led
to a shift of emphasis towards increases in productivity of land already
under cultivation. Increased production was accompanied by a gradual



- 7 -
monetization of the agricultural sector.    The implementation of rural develop-
ment schemes is expected to accelerate this transition towards a cash economy.
Rural Development
24.       Rural development is a primary social and economic objective of
the Government and is one of the targets in the country's indicative guide-
lines of a ten-year statement of policy objectives announced in 1971.
Beyond the aim of raising agricultural productivity, rural development in
Malawi is also viewed as a vehicle for redistributing incomes in favor of
the rural poor. At the moment, most farmers are smallholders on the
fringe of the market economy.   As an instrument of increasing smallholder
productivity, the Government is undertaking several integrated agricul-
tural development schemes in the Lilongwe, Karonga, Shire Valley and
the Central Lake Shore areas.
25.       With the exception of the Central Region Lake Shore Development
Project which has been financed with assistance from the Federal Republic
of Germany, these schemes are being financed with IDA assistance. Credits
113-MAT, 244-MAI and 550-MAI assisted in financing three phases of the
Lilongwe Land Development Program; Credits 114-MAI and 363-MAI helped
finance two phases of the Shire Valley Agricultural Development Project;
and Credit 282-MAI is helping finance a first phase of the Karonga Rural
Development Project. These four schemes are characterized by the provi-
sion of extension and farmer services, agricultural inputs and infrastruc-
tural components within relatively concentrated areas and have made signi-
ficant contributions to institution building, improved production and
standard of living of about one million people. With the objective of
providing improved production opportunities to the rest of Malawi's farm-
ing population, a Bank agricultural sector mission in 1973 suggested a more
extensive type of development. The Government has adopted this strategy
which has become known as the National Rural Development Program (NRDP).
26.       A target period of 20 years has been set for the NRDP to cover
all rural areas of Malawi. Development would be phased and commence with two
or three years of essentially preparatory activities including land and
agro-economic planning, the establishment of agronomic trials, the streng-
thening of extension activities and, where necessary, construction of infra-
structure. Preparation work started in mid-1975 and the third Lilongwe Land
Development Credit (Credit 550-MAI) included about US$200,000 to help finance
the first year's activities. Financing of preparatory investments for two
additional years would be included in the proposed project. A first phase
NRDP project with emphasis on directly productive investments is expected to
be ready for financing in FY78.
27.       The availability of qualified staff is the limiting factor for
the expansion of agriculture development activities, although training facili-
ties have increased in recent years. They include, among others, the Bunda
Agricultural College (a part of the University of Malawi), Colby College
which trains technical assistants, Mikolongwe School and Livestock Improvement
Center which trains veterinary assistants, the Thuchila Farm Inst:itute which
trains women in farm-home management, as well as other schools for fisheries
and forestry assistants. Together, these schools graduated near:Ly 300 students



- 8 -
in 1975. The United States Agency for International Development has recently
agreed to provide financial assistance for further expansion of Bunda College.
The future manpower requirements of the agricultural sector, particularly in
consideration of the high staffing requirements of NRDP, have not yet been
fully analyzed. The Government will undertake a study of these requirements
for the next ten years and discuss its findings and necessary following up
action with the Bank by June 30, 1977 (see Sec. 3.10 of Loan Agreement).
Karonga Rural Development
28.       The Karonga Rural Development Program (KRDP) evolved in the late
1960's when the Government decided to undertake an integrated rural develop-
ment scheme to increase agricultural production in the Karonga and Chitipa
districts of northern Malawi. The Program sought to achieve this objective
by providing substantial infrastructural facilities including boreholes, and
improved farmer services comprising extension, credit, input supplies and
land consolidation.
29.       The first phase of KRDP was appraised in April 1971 and an IDA
credit of US$6.6 million (Credit 282-MAI) became effective in August 1972.
The project had a slow start, due to initial staffing problems, but is now
progressing satisfactorily. Some of the original targets were reduced during
implementation. Higher than anticipated seepage losses made it necessary
to line the main canals of the 1,000 acre Lufira irrigation scheme; in view
of the high costs involved, the development of a second scheme of 500 acres
at Wovwe has not been executed. The construction of the lake terminal at
Chilumba, together with the construction of a self-propelled vessel, turned
out to be too costly to allow for the rehabilitation of a second terminal
at Chipoka with the funds available for the lake transport component; a
provision for this is included in the proposed project. Because of cost
overruns, especially in the construction sector, it was further decided to
reduce the project period from five to four years.
30.       Despite the implementation problems described above, performance
under the First Karonga Project has been satisfactory. Farmers' participa-
tion has been better than was anticipated. A first survey of crop yields
conducted by the project's evaluation unit during the 1974/75 harvest
season suggests substantial production increases as a result of the proj-
ect activities. The experiences gained so far under the project have led
to a better understanding of the feasibility and timing of various project
activities and the lessons drawn from these experiences have been taken
into account in the design of the proposed Second Karonga Project.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
31.       A report entitled "Malawi - Appraisal of the Karonga Rural Develop-
ment Project, Phase II" dated May 20. 1976 is being circulated separately.
A loan and project summary is attached as Annex III. The project was pre-
pared by the Government with the assistance of the Bank's Regional Mission
in Eastern Africa, and was appraised in October/November 1975. Negotiations
were held in Washington from May 11 to May 13, 1976. The Malawi Delegation
was led by Mr. Austin Madinga, Secretary to the Treasury.



-9-
Project Description
32.       The proposed project would, over a 4-year period, continue to
support the agricultural development program instituted in the Karonga and
Chipoka districts under the first project, would further assist, for a
period of two years, in the preparation of NRDP and would provide for the
rehabilitation of the Chipoka Lake terminal and improvements of the tran-
sport services on Lake Malawi. The project consists of the following major
elements:
Karonga and Chitipa
(i) Extension and Training: Continuation and expansion of the
extension and training services provided under Phase I of
the Karonga Rural Development Project. Additional extension
services staEf would be recruited and trained to increase
the ratio of extension staff to farmers from 1:850 at present
to about 1:64)0 on completion of the project. For farmer training,
two existing rural training centers would be upgraded and a
third would be built in Chitipa.
(ii) Animal husbandry and veterinary services: Expansion oF the
existing program for the provision of animal husbandry and
veterinary services to farmers, including construction of
two additional dipping tanks. The project would make lull
use of the livestock demonstration centers built under the
first projeci: at Karonga and Lufita.
(iii) Civil works: Construction of housing facilities for about
75 additional staff and construction or improvement of
about 90 miles of rural roads, including bridges and
culverts, ancl some 80 boreholes. The boreholes would
improve village water supply in the project area, and in
some parts of Chitipa district would enable the cultivation
of hitherto tncultivated but fertile land.
(iv) Research: Continuation of the agricultural and hydrological
research program started under the first phase project, in
close cooperation with the project's extension staff. Research
work would include in particular farm-scale tests of improvements
for major crops.
(v) Seasonal and Medium-term Credit: Continuation of the credit
program initiated under the first project. Inputs such as
seed, fertilizer and pesticides would be made available
to farmers on short-term credit; work-oxen, ox-carts,
ploughs, chains and cotton sprayers would be provided
on medium-term credit. An estimated 4,000 farmers have
benefited from the KRDP I credit scheme and about 7,000
additional farmers are expected to benefit under the second
project scheme. Farmers would be encouraged to organize



- 10 -
themselves into groups to reduce the administrative costs of the
scheme.  Currently, farmers and farmers' groups are charged 12.5
percent per annum for seasonal credit and 10.0 percent per annum for
medium-term credit. These will be increased progressively to levels
which would reflect the interest and administration costs of the
scheme. The Government is preparing a program which will coordinate
and standardize all the different credit schemes being operated in
the country and will discuss details of the program with the Bank
by June 30, 1977 (see Section 3.07 of Loan Agreement).
(vi) Crop Markets and Stores: Construction and operation of nine
market complexes including input stores, market buildings,
office accommodation and housing for the resident ADMARC
staff. Eight small input sheds would be constructed in
the more remote areas of Chitipa district.
(vii)  Health Facilities:   Construction, staffing and operation
of five maternity wards, seven health posts and staff houses,
to provide preventive and curative medical services, health
education, maternal and child care, communicable disease
control and environmental hygiene, and to collect health
statistics. The design and operation of the facilities
would be in accordance with a plan prepared with the assist-
ance of the World Health Organization.
(viii)  Project Evaluation:   Continuation of the evaluation program
started under the first project, including among others, the
collection and processing of data on crop acreages, produc-
tion, and utilization of agricultural inputs, and analyses
of project achievements.
(ix)  Management and Accounting Services:    Continuation of the
provision of management and accounting services, including
staff, transport, housing and office facilities for KPDP.
The project also includes a provision for the staff and
supporting facilities for administration of the expanded
rural credit scheme.
Preparation of the National Rural Development Program
(x) The services of the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
Resources, which will be responsible for preparing and
implementing the NRDP, would be strengthened with addi-
tional staff, and, if necessary, by short-term consultants
for specialized studies on national credit organization.
The project would include the provision of necessary housing
in Lilongwe and Mzuzu, as well as in the three selected devel-
opment areas expected to be covered by the first phase of the
program. In those areas, investments will also be made for
additional infrastructural facilities such as roads, boreholes,



- 1i -
markets and health facilities. The Government has agreed to
complete an on-going land resource and agro-economic survey
of the three areas and to submit detailed development plans
for them to the Bank by September 30, 1977 (see Section 3.06
of the draft Loan Agreement).
Lake Transport
(xi) In order to increase the speed, capacity and reliability of
freight services on Lake Malawi, the project would incLude
construction of berthing facilities and associated structures,
including cargo handling equipment, at Chipoka and the refitting
of an existing motor vessel to increase its bulk petroLeum
carrying capacity. The Government will establish tariffs as
shall be necessary, to enable the Malawi Lake Service to generate
sufficient revenue to cover its operating costs and depreciation
or debt service whichever is greater (see Section 4.04 of the
draft Loan Agreement).
Project Costs and Finartcin
33.       The total cost of the project is estimated at US$12.1 million
including a foreign exchange component of about US$6.3 million. The breakdowm
of project costs is given in Annex III. The proposed loan of USS9.2 million
would finance 75 percent of the total project cost and would cover the requi-
red foreign exchange and $2.9 million of local costs. As explained in para-
graph 17 above, local cost financing is recommended in Malawi. The Government
and ADMARC would contribute the balance of US$2.9 million.
Project Management
34.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources (MANR) would
have overall responsibility for implementing the project. The health
component would be carried out by the Ministry of Health, and the lake
transports component by the Malawi Railways. ADMARC would be responsible
for the construction of the market complexes. The existing management
unit setup under the first project would be retained. The post of Project
Manager has, since 1975, been held by a Malawi national. Several specialist
positions would, however, continue to be occupied by expatriate personnel in
view of the scarcity of trained Malawian staff. Most of these specialists are
expected to be made available by the United Kingdom. The Director of Exten-
sion and Training at MANR, assisted by a coordinator, would be responsible for
the implementation of the NRDP component. The Government will consult with
the Bank on the appointments of the KRDP Project Manager and of the NRDP
Coordinator (see Sec. 3.08 and 3.09 of Loan Agreement). No disbursements will
be made for the NRDP component until the necessary staff positions have been
formally established (see Schedule 1 of Loan Agreement).

Procurement and Disbursement
35.       Vehicles, machinery and equipment in orders exceeding US$50,000
equivalent would be procured through international competitive bidding in
accordance with Bank Group guidelines. The orders would be grouped whenever
possible. Farm inputs and drugs would be procured on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally; foreign suppliers are well represented in the
country. The Ministry of Works and KRDP's construction unit will undertake by
force account the construction of houses and other required infrastructural
facilities in Karonga and Chitipa district, including staff houses and offices,
roads and health facilities. ADMARC would construct and operate the permanent
markets and input stores. Boreholes would be constructed by the Geological
Survey Department of MANR. Civil works under the NRDP component would be
undertaken by the Ministry of Works except for the construction and upgrad-
ing of rural roads which would be undertaken by force account by MANR.
Civil works under the Chipoka harbor improvement works would be awarded
through international competitive bidding. Execution of the project is expected
to be completed in 1980.
36.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed against
(a) 75 percent of total costs for civil works (except crop markets
and input stores which would be constructed by ADMARC); (b) 100 percent
of foreign exchange costs for imported vehicles and equipment, or 75 per-
cent of costs when purchased locally; and (c) 75 percent of operating
costs of the project including wages and salaries. Disbursements against
(a) and (b) would be fully documented. Disbursement against (c) would be
made against appropriate certificates of expenditure. This procedure is
similar to that followed in the first phase of the Karonga project.
Benefits and Risks
37.       The economic rate of return is estimated to be 14 percent for
component A (Karonga-Chitipa), the cost of which is estimated at US$6.6
million, and 18 percent for component C (lake transport), the cost
of which is estimated at US$2.2 million. The average economic rate of
return on these two components, which account for about 73 percent of
total project cost is 16 percent; this aggregate rate of return excludes
the following components for which no meaningful rate of return could be
estimated because of the predominance of non-quantifiable effects: pre-
paration of the NRDP (Part B of project), research, health facilities,
project evaluation and animal husbandry and veterinary services.
38.       In calculating the rates of return, family labor, whose
employment would be increased under the project, was shadow priced at
zero cost because there is no alternative employment for such labor.
The main risks associated with the proposed project include the possi-
bility that fewer farmers than estimated may adopt the improved crop
husbandry methods and that crop yields may be lower than forecast. For
component A of the project (Karonga-Chitipa), a 10 percent reduction



- 13 -
in the benefits would reduce the rate of return to 8 percent while such
a reduction in benefits coupled with a 10 percent increase in costs would
reduce the rate of return to 3 percent. However, adoption rates and yields
have been assumed on a conservative basis and there is an equal probability
that benefits would be higher than forecast. A cost increase of 10 percent
under the Lake transport component would reduce the rate of return under
that component to about 16 percent while a decrease of 10 percent in the
benefits would reduce the rate of return to about 15 percent.
39.       At full deveLopment of phases I and II of the Karonga Rural Devel-
opment Project, the value of the annual incremental agricultural production
is estimated to be over US$2 million in the program area, about two-thirds
of which would accrue Erom the proposed phase II. The proposed project
would extend the KRDP agricultural services primarily into the sparsely
populated Chitipa District. An estimated 10,000 additional farmers whose
present per capita incomes are at the absolute poverty level of US$40 would,
as a result of the pro:ject investments, be able to increase their annual
earnings from crop production by an average of US$45 depending on the type and
size of their farms. A much larger number of farm families would benefit from
the project's investments on health and water facilities and the construction
of rural roads.   The project would also provide temporary additional employ-
ment for about 1,000 people. The construction of berthing facilities and
associated structures at Chipoka would increase the capacity of the port,
decrease ship turnaround time, increase the productivity of cargo handling and
reduce cargo damage.
40.       After completion of the project and excluding debt service, the
annual net cost to the Government to maintain the level of extension and other
services amounts to about US$0.6 million annually leading to a cumulative
total of about US$12 mi'llion by 1996.   Including debt service, the annual net
cost to the Government is slightly over US$1 million leading to a cumulative
total of about US$22 mi'llion by 1996. These annual costs are normally covered
from the Government's general budget allocations. In view of the Government's
narrow revenue base, it: is not clear whether the additional recurrent costs
could be absorbed without some changes in government policies such as those
governing the pricing of agricultural produce or the taxation system. There-
fore, the Government will undertake a study of the long-term budgetary impli-
cations of this and all, other projects in the agricultural sector and wil1
discuss the findings of' the study with the Bank by September 30, 1977 (see
Section 4.03 of the Loan Agreement).

C. Projects in Execution I/
Credit No. 102-MAI Education; US$6.3 million credit of May 4, 1967; Date of
Effectiveness: July 3, 1967; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project consists of the construction and equipping of one
national primary teacher training college and the provision of technical
instruction facilities in 12 secondary schools. The project has been imple-
mented satisfactorily and school premises have been in use for about two
years. A request from the Government to use savings under the credit, amount-
ing to about US$420,000, for the construction of a post and telecommunications
school to be jointly used by Malawi, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland was
agreed to by the Executive Directors on December 4, 1973. The Closing Date
has consequently been postponed to June 30, 1977. Implementation of the
telecommunications school is progressing satisfactorily.
Credit No. 282-MAI Agriculture - Karonga Development Project; US$6.6 million
credit of January 26, 1971; Date of Effectiveness:
August 14, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
The project is the first phase of an agricultural development program
for the Karonga area. It includes development of irrigated rice cultivation,
dry-land crop production, Livestock development, extension services, credit,
health services and the rehabilitation of freight service on Lake Malawi.
In spite of a slow start due to delays in recruiting senior staff and in the
construction program the project has made reasonable progress. Cost escala-
tions have compelled reductions in the scope of some components of the
project. The irrigated double cropped rice scheme will be reduced from 1,500
acres to 1,000 acres and part of the rehabilitation work for the freight ser-
vice on Lake Malawi will be completed under the proposed second Karonga Rural
Development Project. Because of the heavy cost overruns, especially in the
construction sector, it was further decided to reduce the project period from
five to four years.
Credit No. 363-MAI Agriculture - Shire Valley Development Project Phase II;
US$10.5 million credit of March 28, 1973; Date of Effective-
ness: April 27, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project is a continuation and an expansion of the program com-
pleted under Phase I and includes extension services, credit and marketing
facilities, a livestock component, health facilities, fisheries development,
feeder road construction, research on irrigated and rainfed crops, land
registration and wildlife protection. Due to a combination of technical
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered and the action taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

and social factors, crop output may be lower than envisaged at appraisal.
The Government is currentLy reviewing the cropping program in detail
and a revision of the pro,iuction targets may become necessary. The road
construction program is making satisfactory progress. A senior health
officer for the health component assumed duties recently and is now working
on the urgently needed operational health program.
Credit No. 426-MAI Second Power Project; US$7.5 million credit of
September 7, 1973; Date of Effectiveness: April 19, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The project provides part of Mtalawi's power generation develop-
ment program for the period 1973-1977 and consists of: (a) the construction
of a barrage and 20 MW hydroelectric power station at Tedzani, as an exten-
sion to the station financed under Credit 178-MtAI; (b) the installation of a
12 MW gas turbine, to be constructed at Blantyre; and (c) a tariff study.
The CDC is co-financing the project with a loan of US$6.1 million equivalent.
As a result of recent world-wide increases in prices, a cost overrun of
about US$4 million equivalent is expected. CDC has agreed to provide an
additional US$2 million ec[uivalent towards meeting this cost overrun, and
Escom is expected to finance the balance of the overrun from its own sources.
In spite of the cost overrun, the project remains the first choice among the
various alternatives for meeting Malawi's projected power demand.
Credit No. S-17-MAI   Transport Engineering and Services Project; US$2.0 million
credit of June 13, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: August 28,
1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project would determine the infrastructural requirements and
provide technical assistance for the exploitation of the Viphya forest re-
sources. Necessary transportation studies and the design of the required
transport facilities have been completed and work is nearly finished on the
preparation of bid documents. VIPCOR, the Malawi organization which is in
charge of the Viphya project, is in the process of selecting financing and
technical partners for the Viphya project.
Credit No. 523-MAI    Second Highway Project; US$10.0 million credit of
December 19, 1974; Date of Effectiveness: February 21,
1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The contract for the civil works under this project has been awarded
Construction works are, however, behind schedule because of unexpectedly bad
weather conditions and equipment problems. A supervision mission scheduled
for mid-June 1976 will review the situation. Implementation of the District
Roads Pilot Program is on schedule.

Credit No. 550-MAI Agriculture - Lilongwe Land Development Program Phase III;
US$8.5 million credit of May 27, 1975; Date of Effective-
ness: August 12, 1975; Closing Date: June 30, 1979
The project is a continuation and expansion of the program started
in 1968 and provides for strengthened agricultural extension services, credit
and marketing facilities, additional health facilities, livestock activiLies
(including a ranch, stall feeding, and dairy and poultry development), road
construction and soil conservation, land demarcation and registration and
village water supply. The project is progressing well and is generally on
target but has experienced difficulties during the 1974/75 season with obtain-
ing adequate and timely supplies of fertilizers and other inputs. The manage-
ment position of the project has improved with the appointment of three
Malawian management assistants for inpost training as future heads of depart-
ments and project managers.
Credit No. 590-MAI Second Education Project; US$11.6 million credit of
November 24, 1975; Date of Effectiveness: February 24,
1976; Closing Date: March 31, 1981
The project would provide prototype construction models of primary
schools, strengthen the program of rural education, establish a new primary
teacher training college, and add facilities for the teaching of practical
subjects in selected secondary schools with emphasis on facilities for girls.
Prior to becoming effective on February 24, 1976, the project had made a good
start by early appointment of consultant architects. Key personnel for the
Project Implementation Unit had been hired, including a Malawian Project
Director and a Project Architect.   The Government is currently seeking bi-
lateral aid from the United Kingdom to provide architects to assist the
Project Architect in designing primary schools and adult education centers.
Due to lack of skilled manpower, difficulties have arisen in finding Malawian
counterparts to Project Unit draftsmen.
