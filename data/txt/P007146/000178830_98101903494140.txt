A??Th2JSA'AL OF AN EDUCATICN PRWOECT IN E SALVADOR
SUI'TIARY
i.        The Government of El Salvador has made a reauest to the Bank for
financial assistance to expand and improve secondary education and agricul-
tural post-secondary education.
ii.       The project consists of the construction and equipment of 17 sec-
ondary schools and the addition of facilities to 10 existing secondary schools
and one agricultural institute as well as the provision of equipment to 2
technical institutes. The schools would offer, in addition to academic edu-
cation, industrial, agricultural or commercial options. The project would
increase enrollment in public general and technical secondary schools to
535000 by 1975 by adding 15;500 new places and provide 32% of the graduates
from public secondary schools.
iii,      The ratio of applicants for admission to secondary education to
the number of available seats would be sufficiently high to provide entrants
of adequate quality. Graduates of the schools should have good chance of
finding suitable employment,
iv.       The supply of secondary school teachers would be sufficient pro-
vided the proposed training program at the new teacher-training college in
San Andres is implemented and 75 scholarships are awarded as a part of the
project for the training of teachers in agriculture, industry and commerce -
partly on courses abroad. A number of project schools principals would also
be trained in modern school administration,
v.        The proposed project would permit the implementation of a new and
improved school curriculum with increased teaching of science and vocational
courses at secondary level and an improvement in post-secondary agricultural
education. The schools would be supplied with up-to-date and reasonably
priced equipment.
vi.       Competent architects, engineers and contracting firms are available
in El Salvador but technical assistance is needed for execution of the pro-
posed expansion of the agricultural institute.
vii.      All procurement for civil works, furniture and equipment would be
subject to international competitive bidding procedures.
viii.     The project would be administered by a special project unit.  The
Bank would approve the selection of the director of such unit.
ix.       The proposed project would cost about US$8.4 million equivalent
over an implementation period of five years, 1969-1973. The foreign exchange
-component of US$4.9 million equivalent, including interest during construction,
is 58% of total project cost. The estimated construction costs are reason-
able, The government's capital contribution to the project and the consequent
increase in recurrent expenditure would be within the capacity of the
government to provide out of its own resources.

x.        The project is suitable for a Bank loan in the amount of USt4.9
million equivalent, equal to the foreign exchange component of the project.

APPPA1SAL OF AN EDUCATION PROJECT IN EL SALVADOR
1. EITRODUCTION
1.01      In October 1966 the Bank group received a request from the Government
of El Salvador for financial assistance to expand and improve general,
industrial and agricultural secondary education and secondary teacher train-
ing and to construct an educational television institute. The project had
been identified by a Unesco mission, and was prepared with assistance from
the Bank and Unesco. It was appraised in November/December 1966 by a Bank
mission. However, in 1967, a new Salvadorian cabinet decided to revise the
request by transferring secondary teacher training and TV-education to a
USAID project and by including more industrial, agricultural and commercial
education in the proposed Bank project.
1.02      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission com-
posed of I4essrs. M. Hultin (general education), R. IvicMahon (technical edu-
cation), P. Oltmanns (architect), F. Lethem (economist) and A. G. Apodaca
(FAO, agricultural education) which was in El Salvador in IMarch 1968.
2. BACKGROUND
2M01      El Salvador is the smallest of the six Central American Republics.
It covers an area of 21,000 km2 and no place in the country is further away
than 180 km by road from the capital, San Salvador.  The population was es-
timated to be 3.15 million in 1967. The birthrate is high and an annual
population increase of 3.7% is expected.  There are indications, however,
that family planning is gaining wider acceptance. A birth control program
was recently started and population groweth rate is therefore, expected to
decline.  The country has, with 150 persons per km , one of the highest
population densities in the Americas. The area around the capital is par-
ticularly densely populated but elsewhere the population is fairly evenly
distributed. About 60% of the population is rural. The official language
is Spanish.
2.02      El Salvador's economy consists of a group of growing modern activ-
ities and a large subsistence agriculture, with a wide gap between the two.
The former includes manufacturing and commerce concentrated in three urban
centers and an export-oriented segment in the agricultural sector. The per-
formance of subsistence agriculture has not matched the demand for food irn
the country during the last decade.  The Gross Domestic Product remained
stagnant during the late 1950's but has showm an upward trend during thhe
last five years as shown in the following table:

1962        641           10.9         244              7.0
1963        671            4.7         247              1.2
1964        746           11.1         265              7.3
1965        797            6.8         272              2.6
1966        842            5.6         277              1.8
2.03      Agriculture is the largest single factor in the economy, accounting
for 26% of the GDP in 1967.  During the early 1950ts, rising coffee prices
sustained a growth of the GDP.  In the late 1950's a drop in coffee prices
led to a slovwdownl and a shift to cotton plantations. The increase in cotton
exports coupled with the recovery of coffee prices and the expansion in
Central American trade, has been the cause of the recent growth of GDP.
However, more modest prospects for exports over the next few years may lead
to a substantially slower rate of growth for the economy.
2.04      Manufacturing has grown at an annual average rate of 11% since
1960, and now accounts for 20% of the GDP.  This growth has been greatly
helped by the creation of the Central American Common Market.  Foreign in-
vestors have been attracted by good market conditions. The construction
sector is likely to show an increase due to the government housing program
now underway,
2.05      About 32% of El Salvador's population are economically active.
Of the estimated labor force of 807,000 in 1961, about 60% were agricultural
workers and 22% semi-skilled or skilled indusStrial workers. The wage level
has remained fairly stable as has the price level.  The industrial laborers
in the urban centers receive rates varying from the equivalent of US$0025
to US$0.33 per hour with US$1.30 per day as the legal minimum.
2,06      El Salvador prepared a F-ive-Year Econamic Development Plan for the
period 1965-1969, planning an increase in real GDP of 6.5% per year. Although
this rate was achieved in 1965 and 1966, there may be a deceleration during
the rest of the Plan period, due to the slaoer rate of foreign investments
in industry, and the likely decline of agricultural exports.
3. THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SYSTE14
The Structure of Education
3.01      Primary education requires six years (Annex 1).  An examination
qualifies for admission to secondary schools. General secondary education
is offered as a three-year junior secondary course (Plan 3asico) followed by
a two-year senior secondary course (Bachillerato). The latter is taken by
candidates for university admission.  It has now been decided to extend thi
Bachillerato course by one y*:r.



3' .CX2   iupils completing primary or junior secondary education are of-
fered vocational education at secondary level in schools of several types.
The government has recently decided to phase out industrial and agricul-
tural schools at the junior secondary level and raise the entrance level
of primary teacher training institutes to completion of senior secondary
education (Annex 1). Existing higher education institutions are also
show,n on the chart.
The Administration of Education
3.03      Administration is centralized under the Ninistry of Education
which has been reorganized with Unesco assistance to achieve higher effi-
ciency in planning, imhplementation of school reforms, school construction
and supervision (Annex 2).
3.04      The reorganized NLinistry of Education has a separate planning
unit which cooperates with the government's Planning Council.  The Council,
which includes educational experts, does the overall planning and coordi-
nates foreign aid while the Ministry?s planning unit is responsible for
detailed planning and project execution.
3.05      There are no regional or local school boards in El Salvador and
the authority of the school principals is very limited.  Many schools have
parents' associations which show much interest in education and contribute
financially to the schools, providing for additional school buildings, a
part of the teachers' salaries and school equipment.
Enrollment
3.06      Between 1960 and 1967 enrollment in primary education increased
from 300,000 to 412,000, a 37% increase and in secondary education from
33,000 to 60,400 about 83% (Annex 3). However, this expansion is moderate
if considered in relation to population increase; enrollments of appropriate
school-age groups increased frcm 55% to 63% in primary education and from
11% to 15% in secondary education during this 1960-67 period.  Secondary
school enrollment in El Salvador is compared with some other American
countries in the 1960ts in the following table:
Secondary School Enrollment as a
Percentage of Relevant Age Group
Country                         Percentage
Guatemala                            9%
El Salvador                         15%
Nlexico                             17%
Brazil                              22%
Argentina                           40%
U.S.A.                              93%
It is estimated that primary school enrollment by 1975 will have grown to
595,000, or 76% of the relevant age group, and secondary school enrollment
to 143,000 or 26% of the age group (Annex 4).  Pablic secondary schools
would enroll 53,000 students.



-4-
Primary Education
3.07      There are about 2,400 public and 100 private primary schools.
On average there are 160 students per school and 31 per class, figures
which compare favorably with many developing countries. Mhe numbers of
boys and girls are almost equal. Urban schools contain 70% of the total
enrollment although less than 40% of the population is classified as urban.
Rural schools often go no further than second grade which implies that a
considerable number of rural students leave school with no more than two
years of education.  The overall dropout rate is, therefore, high and only
20% of those entering Primary 1 graduate six years later (Annex 5). Twenty
percent of students are repeaters. Of the primary teachers, 45% have not
received an adequate professional training and many work only part-time
whereas others work extra hours to an extent incompatible wiith full effi-
ciency. Primary education is free, although parents' associations often
pay voluntary contributions (para. 3.05).
3.08      The standard of primary education is being raised, and dropout
reduced by the construction of schools offering a full six-years course,
by the adoption of a new curriculum to better satisfy the needs of the
country and by raising teacher quality. A large primary school building
program - 1,600 classrooms - financed by USAID has been completed.
General Secondary Education
3.09      In 1967 general secondary education was provided by 95 public
coeducational schools (Institutos Nacionales de Educaci6n)_>7  and more than
200 private unaided schools. The total enrollment was 42,700 (fairly
evenly divided between public schools and private schools), of which 55%
were boys and 45% were girls.  Five thousand of these were enrolled in
night schools   All townships of any importance have secondary schools and
these are accessible by bus or by other means of transportation from most
parts of the country.  Boarding is, therefore, not provided.  The capacity
of most rural schools is, however, limited and there is an unevenness of
opportunities between provinces. The secondary schools in the capital,
San Salvador, offer five times as many openings per primary pupil as the
schools in some eastern provinces. The overall index of opportunity for
those few who finish primary education has, however, been high.  Two primary
graduates out of three have found a place in grade 1 of secondary education.
Improved primary education with higher promotion rates will triple the
number of primary school graduates in 1966-1975, which will cause greater
pressure for secondary school admission and raise the standard of secondary
education.

- 5 -
3.10      Secondaiv- education has expanded rapidly since 1945 and has led
to the proliferation of many small and uneconomic units. The average pub-
lic school has 220 students and the average private school less than 100
students, enrollments which penrit only an academic program and make oper-
ation expensive. Government has now decided on a new curriculum with a
wider range of subjects and on larger school units.  Dropouts and repeaters
are common in secondary education; the problem is not as serious as in pri-
mary education (Annex 5) but it creates small and, therefore, uneconomic
classes in the upper grades. The output from general secondary education
is also hampered by a comparatively low rate of passes ((70-80%) in
the final examinations in the third and fifth grades. The introduction of
a new curriculum should, therefore, be combined with a revision of the
examination system.
3.11      The purpose of the schools has been almost solely preparation
for university with the curriculum based on the humanities.  The new
curriculum will provide for more science teaching and for vocational
options in industrial, agricultural and commercial subjects, to broaden
the concept of secondaryr education.  Instructional television will form
an integral part of the new teaching in Plan Basico schools.
3.12      Eighty-two pU'blic secondary schools in El SalvadorlX
occupy rented private buildings which were originally intended as pri-
vate houses and are adaptable to teaching of academic subjects only.
Most public schools lack equipment for the teaching of science and
practical subjects. The supply of textbooks is also insuffici.ent. A
few private schools are of high quality but the majority are inferior
to the public schools in all respects.  Oral teaching and learxing by
rote is characteristic of the whole secondary school system. The over-
all standard is very low but a general improvement in both public and
private schools should result from current Unesco and USAID assistance
in school supervision and teacher training and by the development of
new curricula.
3.13      Public secondary education is free but many parent associations
pay voluntary contributions of 5 to 10 colones a month per student to
improve education (para. 3.05). Tuition fees in private schools vary from
20 to 45 colones a month per student.
3.14      Data on the availability of secondary school teachers is very
limited.  Part-time teaching is frequent as well as teaching on overtime.
Of a total of 2,200 general secondary school teachers, about 1,100 are
teaching mainly in public schools. Xost teachers will need upgrading to
teach the new curriculum. Gradual abolition of the part-time teaching
system is necessary.
3.15      At present 80;Ž% of the graduates fram the two examination
levels in general secondary education proceed to further education. The
few who enter the labor market have until now had no serious difficulties
in findings jobs although employers criticize the graduates for unsuitable
education and lack of vocational orientation.

Industrial Secondary Education and Vocational Training
3.16      In 1967 enrollment in technical secondary education including
schools offering industrial training, fine arts and domestic science was
1,800. Industrial education and training is provided in one public and
two private institutions. The two private institutions are the Colegio
Salesiano "Santa Cecilia" at Santa Tecla and the Instituto Tecnico Rical-
done at San Salvador both operated by the Salesian Order; the standard
of these institutions is high. The one public institution, the San Sal-
vador National Technical Institute (Instituto Tecnico Industrial), suffers
acutely from poor management and neglect over a number of years. However,
a new Director has recently been appointed, Japanese technical assistance
obtained and recurrent finance for operating the Institute substantially
increased. To ensure satisfactory development of this Institute the main
outstanding requirements are that the technical teaching staff should be
improved both in numbers and quality, new equipment acquired, and certain
existing buildings remodelled. Two additional public industrial schools
have recently been constructed and will be brought into use when furnished
and equipped. There are no fees in public schools but students in private
schools pay about 45 colones a month.
3.17      The National Department of Apprenticeship in the Ninistry of
Labor has managed an apprentice program since 1962 which combines on-the-
job training in private enterprises with formal instruction during the
evenings. About 5,000 apprenticeship contracts have been made. The
liaison between the Department of Apprenticeship and private enterprises
is good.
Agricultural Secondary and Post-Secondary Education
3.18      Agricultural education is given at the National School of Agri-
culture at San Andres (Escuela Nacional de Agricultura) which accepts stu-
dents who have completed a full secondary education. Current enrollment
is 250. A small agricultural school at junior secondary level is being
d           phased out.
3.19      The San Andres School is fairly well-equipped and staffed
by qualified professors, some with university education and post-graduate
degrees. However, most of the professors would benefit from training in
course preparation and teaching methods. The existing buildings suffice
for current enrollment but do not permit further expansion. Graduates
from the Agricultural School have been in great demand and usually find
good employment.
Commercial Secondary Education
3.20      With the exception of the National Commercial School which
offers accountancy and secretarial courses, commercial secondary educa-
tion is given in private schools. Of the 60,400 students enrolled in
1967 in all types of secondary schools, 10,000 or 17% were fol-
lowing commercial courses. The quality of courses offered varies;
secretarial courses are satisfactory but employers have great difficulties
in finding staff qualified for modern business methods in accounting and



bL,:^ikeeping. The overall school output would seeml high ccmpa-red writh the
estimated nwumner or jobs, but unemployment among the graduates is not found
because almost all students are girls some of whom never enter the labor
market whereas others stay only a short time in their office jobs.
Primary Teacher Training
3.21      Primary teachers have until now been trained in seven national and
46 private training colleges of secondary level in poorly equipped buildings
originally intended for private houses. There has been an unplanned growth
in total enrollment which has resulted in over-production. The government
has, therefore, decided to close several national colleges and concentrate the
training in one new national college in San Andres at post-secondary level
with up-to-date facilities recently constructed with financial aid from UTSAID.
The annual output would be reduced from 2,2C0 to 1,000, which is considered
sufficient.
3.22      The new post-secondary course requires two years.  Shorter in-service
courses are available for untrained teachers.
Secondary Teacher Training
3.23      The teaching staff in public general secondary schools is approxi-
mately 1,100 of whom less than half should be regarded as fully qualified.
The projected rise in enrollment by 1975 of 27,000 in those schools over the
1967 figure of 19,000, would require an additional staff of 1,900 teachers for
replacement and new posts during the period 1968-1975. In addition, 100
teachers in practical subjects would be needed for expanded public technical
education.
3.24      Secondary teachers are trained in the department of education at the
National University but the annual supply is less than ten and will presumably
not exceed thirty in the projected period. The Catholic University intends to
start teacher training but it will take some time until the impact of such
training is noticeable. A more important source of secondary teachers is the
new teacher training college in San Andres (Ciudad Normal Alberto I4asferrer)
which has facilities for both primary and secondary teacher training. It has
a new plan of studies and technical assistance is being given by USAID for
curriculum revision and staff training. An annual intake of 200 primary
teachers on one or two year courses for training as Plan Basico teachers and
of 125 Bachilleres on three year courses for training as Bachillerato teachers
would be sufficient to cover the public schools' demand up to 1976 and would
require 775 of the collegets 1,200 places. Industrial teachers can be trained
in sufficient numbers in the Ricaldone Institute and commercial teachers at
the National University, but this training needs to be complemented by a
period of practical experience. There are few suitable facilities for such
experience in ml Salvador and teachers in industry and commerce should, there-
fore, receive a part of the practical training abroad. Agricultural teachers
should be trained partly at the Andres Agricultural School and partly abroad.
Higher Education
3.25      Apart from the secondary teacher training college, higher education
is offered at the National University (Universidad Nacional de E1 Salvador".
the private Catholic University (Universidad Catolica Jose S. Canas) ;v al;



- 8 -
a small school for social studies. The National University has an annual
intake of 1,550 students and an enrollment of 5,500. The projected enroll-
ment at the end of the decade is 6,000 with an annual intake of 2,000.  The
private university has just started its activities with an annual intake of
-400. The projected enrollment is 1,500. Annex 1 shows the university courses
offered. A higher technical institute (Instituto Tecnologico Centroamericano),
partly financed by the United Kingdom, is under construction and will give
two and three year courses at post-secondary level for approximately 300 stu-
dents starting in 1969. Higher education absorbs at present almost all grad-
uates from general senior secondary schools and the projected increased intake
will require expansion of senior secondary education.
Television Education
3.26      The government has decided to introduce television into its educa-
tional system simultaneously with the new curricula to improve the quality
of classroom instruction and to upgrade and train teachers through an inten-
sive program of in-service teacher education. After an experimental period,
the first application of instructional television is planned to train some
2,000 teachers for service in junior secondary schools. At the same time,
production of broadcast lessons in the general curriculum at the junior sec-
ondary level with special emphasis on science subjects, mathematics and
English will be started. In a later phase it will be extended to serve pri-
mary school teachers and to provide better learning opportunities for the
children at these grade levels. The final phase of instructional television
development would provide literacy education fcr out of school youths and
adults and continuing adult education.
3.27      A special department within the iMinistry of Education has been
created to develop instructional television, to acquire necessary facilities
and to administer the program. The many problems of television teacher and
technical staff training are recognized as well as the problem of coordinat-
ing television instruction with the general curriculum. A firm organiza-
tional base will, therefore, be developed and television instruction will
expand gradually through a five-year plan as its capabilities and resources
increase.
3.28      The T.V project forms part of a USAID education development program
and close cooperation will be established between TV instruction and teacher
training by locating the TV center at the teacher training college in San
Andres.
Education Research
3.29      A government laboratory to develop simple tools and equipment for
basic science teaching appears promising in its activities and should play
an important role in raising the quality of science teaching. No other ex-
perimental activities exist although the country will, in due course, benefit
from the development of textbooks and teaching aids now being assisted in
other Central American countries by international organizations.

Foreign Aid
3.30      Between 1960-1967, El Salvador has received foreign financial
assistance for the construction of primary schools and a teacher training
college (U.S.) for laboratory equipment (Unicef) and for the construction
and staffing of the State University (Inter-American Development Bank,
Central American Bank, Ford and Rockefeller Foundations). Technical as-
sistance has been given for television education, for teacher
training, agricultural education, curriculum improvement, textbook pro-
duction (U.S.) and for technical education (ILO and Japan). A Unesco team
is now helping in the field of educational planning, teacher training,
administration and finance. A post-secondary technical institute is being
built with U.K. assistance.
3.31      Additional aid is being considered for primary education, teacher
training, curriculum improvement and educational television (U.S.) and for
university education (Inter-American Development Bank and Central American
Bank).
4. EDUCATIONAL FINANCE
4.01      Betuween 1960 and 1966 total goverment expenditure on education
increased from ?33.3 million to /62.5 million, or from 2.3% to 3.0% of GDP.
Taking account of private expeniditures on education, amounting to an esti-
mated 09.5 million, total education expenditure was about US$9.60 per capita,
or 3.4% of GDP in 1966 (Annex 6). The share of GDP spent by the govern-
ment on education may seem small compared to the 3.9% spent by Colombia and
the 5.5% spent by Guyana - two other W.esteln Hemisplhere countries with a GDP
per capita in the $250 range.  It represents nevertheless a heavy burden on
the country's public resources, since tax revenues also constitute a low
proportion of GDP; in 1966, only 9.8%.
4.02      As a result of the accelerated growth in the number of school
age children, primary education expenditures grew at 9% per year and claimed
2/3 of the 1960-1966 increase in government recurrent expenditures on
education.  During the same period, expenditure on general and technical
secondary education decreased from 8.5% to 6.9% of the Ministry of Education
recurrent expenditure, the recurrent cost per student decreasing meanwhile
to 0160 by 1966. Total expenditure per secondary school student was ac-
tually higher - 0210 - as a result of parents' voluntary annual contriou-
tions.  This higher sum is, however, also insufficient and below the
minimum necessary for good quality teaching in terms of both staff and
material expenditure.
4.03      The Ministry of Education wvill have to invest about 085 million
in 1969-1974 or 014 million per year to achieve the projected expansion of
public education. This amount is above the financial capacity of the coun-
try and foreign assistance is needed.      If   projected    foreign



- 10 -
aid is taken into account, the government would have to finance about 010
million per year from its own resources - an increase of 40% above the
average in 1965-1967. It is only after 1975 that effects of the family
planning program would be felt in primary education enrollments and re-
sulting investments.
4.04      Enrollment and cost projections suggest that between 1966 and
1975 recurrent expenditure on secondary education caused by the planned
expansion will increase by 15io a year against 6% a year for primary educa-
tion and will result in a better balance between the financial allocations
to the different types of education (Annexes 7 and 8). Assuming full-time
secondary teachers, adequate maintenance and sufficient supply of teaching
material the recurrent costs per student in the new general secondary
schools may reach 0300 per year, which would be an appropriate figure
under present circumstances (para. 6.20).
4.05      The projected expansion in government schools will cause an in-
crease of total public educational expenditure from 062.5 million in 1966
to an estimated ll6 million by 1975 (Annex 9 and table below). The table
has been constructed for illustrative purposes only, on the assumption that
the government will adopt new revenue measures and follow a policy of
moderate growth in recurrent expenditures other than for education. Public
recurrent expenditures on education would thus increase from 27% to 32% of
tax revenues - and fron 2.6% to 3.6% of GDP - which seems to correspond to
the Governmentts allocation of priorities.

5. T`l NEED FOR EXPANSION ANTD IMPROVEMENT
OF SECONDA.Y EDUCATION
MIanpower Need
5.01      On the basis of alternative projections of GDP, occupation struc-
ture and educational requirements, and after evaluation of the manpower
projections made by the National Planning Council, and the CSUCA (Consejc
Superior Universitario Centroamericano), the following rates of growth in
the stocks of educated manpower appear justified on economic grounds
between 1967-76:
Primary education            5 -   6% per annum
Secondary education        5.5 - 6.5% per annum
Higher education           4.5 - 5.5% per annum
(with 25% as secondary teachers)
5.02      In terms of educational investment priorities, the major ga.ps
and resulting potential constraints to further economic development in
industry and agriculture are in secondary education. This is supported
by discussiorB with public authorities and private enterprises which con-
firm that current outputs of skilled workers and middle-level techmicians
from schools and training centers are too low.  In fact, the country has
to attract workers from abroad to fill the gap.
5.03      There is considerable scarcity of qualified secondary teachers
while qualified primary teachers are in oversupply.  Programs to correct
this situation have, however, started. (Paras. 3.21, 3.24).
5.04      The government has planned an expansion of public secondary
education with increased emphasis on industrial, agricultural and com-
mercial training to meet the manpower requirements, although limited
financial resolurces and a shortage of qualified teachers may prevent
full coverage.  The enrollment in all types of secondary education ex-
cluding primary teacher training is projected to increase from 47,000 in
1965 to 143,000 in 1975 (Annex 10-a) and the government would provide one-
third of the new places or 32,000 in public schools.  The total annual out-
put from the two exaination levels (Plan Basico and Bachillerato) would
increase by 22,400 from 10,400 in 1965 to 32,800 in 1975 (Annex 10-b).
Eight thousand of the graduates would come from upper secondary educaticn
with 3,900 having a prevocational or vocational education.
5.05      The supply of graduates to the labor market is considerably less
than school output because many secondary school graduates proceed to fur-
ther education, some girls do not enter the labor market and evening schcO'
students are already in the labor market.
5.06      Taking into account the reduction factors mentioned in para. 5.0>
the estimated aggregate supply at the current rate of secondary school grl2d-
uates entering the labor market in 1967-1976 is compared with the supply
from the proposed expanded school system in the table that follows.  It ,'E'
shows how the labor market demand. would be ret.

5.08      The annual demand for high level manpower (including primary and
secondary teachers) would require an annual intake of about 3,700 students
into post-secondary institutes and universities. Nine hundred of those stll-
dents would be provided through the planned expansion of public education
while the remainder would come from other public and private schools.
5.09      The table in para. 5.06 reveals that the planned school expansion
would considerably reduce the shortage of middle-level manpower in the period
1967-1976. Paras. 5.07 and 5.08 show that annual supply and demand at senior
secondary and university level would be reasonably balanced at the end of the
period considering the limited accuracy of manpower estimates. The govern-
ment's secondary school program is justified from a manpower point of view
and the increased emphasis it places on industrial and agricultural educa-
tion is particularly important.
The Educational Need
5.10      A qualitative improvement of the secondary system is urgently
needed to raise the general standard in academic, agricultural, commercial
and industrial schools. The number of repeaters, dropouts and failures in
final examinations must also be reduced. The new curriculum for secondarY
schools with emphasis on science and prevocational and vocational options
which is being developed within the Ministry of Education should provide the
improvement needed but also necessitates modern equipment and a well developed
training program for teachers.
5.11      Most existing secondary schools occupy rented private houses and
cannot be rebuilt or expanded to provide for adequate teaching of a new
curriculum with practical as well as academic subjects or permit an economi-
cal student:teacher ratio. A number of new schools of adequate sizes and
modern design must, therefore, be provided. Ten secondary schools have
suitable buildings and could be extended to accommodate larger enrollments.
However, their laboratories and workshops lack equipment and the expansion
must, therefore, be cambined with a complete provision of equipment. At thf
San Andres agricultural school, improvement in instruction will require new
buildings and modern equipment.
6. THE PROJECT
6.01      The project would comprises
(a)  The construction and equipment of 17 new secondary schools
(ten Plan Basico, six mixed Plan Basico and Bachillerato,
one Bachillerato);
(b)  The expansion of ten existing secondary schools (one Plan .asic
five   mixed Plan Basico and Bachillerato, four BachilleraLe6);
(c)  The provision of equipment to two existing technical (iiidiis-
trial) secondary institutes;



-14 -
(d) The expansion of the agricultural institute in San Andres.
The project would also include technical assistance to agricultural educatioo
as well as 90 fellowships for the training of Salvadorian teachers in agri-
culture, industry, commerce and of school administrators.(Annexes 10 and 11)

6.03      The proposed project would be implemented during 1969-1973.  It
would raise public secondary school enrollment to 53,000 in 1975 by addin-
15,500 new places and the annual output from the two examination levels tc
14,000 by adding 4,500 new graduates (32%). Two private technical schools
would increase their output by 100 and the agricultural institute by 55. her-
students in the project's senior secondary and post-secondary schools would
be distributed between options as shown as follows:



Humanities      1,860      18,r
Science         2,200      22%
Industry        3,40       3 4$
Commerce          880       9%
Agriculture     i,670      l7,'
Total     10,090    10O,-1
The annual output from vocational options would increase by 1,600 through
the project.
Secondary Schools
6.o0      The location of the proposed 17 new secondary schools together
with an expansion oflOexisting schools would reduce the unevenness of
opportunities for secondary education between provinces.   Ten of the 16
senior secondary schools would offer prevocational or vocational education
in addition to academic courses and constitute the first opportunity for
students in many places to receive such education. The average school
size of 700 students would permit economic operation of sufficiently di-
versified academic programs.
6.D5      A new curriculum with greater emphasis on science and the needs
in industry, agriculture and cormerce would be used in the project schools;l
The teaching in junior secondary schools will be supported by integrated
instructional television within a common program for all students.  In
seinor secondary schools the common core of subjects would be reduced and
the students would devote 50%         of their time to specializations such
as industry (mechanical, electrical and auto engineering), agriculture, conm
merce (accounting and secretarial courses), humanities and science. In
industry and commerce the training would be vocational and permit the stu-
dents to enter the labor market without additional formal training. In
agriculture the education would be prevocational and should be followed by
additional courses organized by agricultural organizations or by the San
Andres Agricultural School.      The four schools with agriculture would,
however, all have farmland (10 hectares) as well as cattle for animal hus-
bandry and the students would spend considerable time on the farm. The
curriculum revision has started iith assistance from Unesco and USAID and
its completion in 1969 would form a necessary condition for a successful
execution of the governmentIs school reform.
6.06      All sites but orne for the proposed secondary schools have been
acquired. They are adequate in size and suitably located within or on th-e
outskirts of townships.
6.07      Schools offering junior secondary education only, would be pro-
vided with classrooms for forty students, adidnistration office, staff-
room and necessary stores, but would have only one workshop and laboratory
each.  A box system for science kits wvould allow the use of classrooms for
a part of science teaching and reduce project costs considerably. The
senior secondary schools in the project would have a full complement of
classrooms, laboratories, workshops and libraries as well as necessary
rooms for administration, staff and storage.  The room utilization wolzi d



- 16 -
be high in all schools and the junior secondary schools would later on be
used on a double shift basis. All schools would be designed for televised
instruction in addition to conventional classroom teaching. Farniture and
equipment for classrooms, laboratories, workshops and farms would follow
standard lists. Dining and dormitory facilities are not needed. One care-
taker house would be constructed in each of 17 schools but no other staff
houses would be included in the project.
Technical Institutes
6.08      Accommodation at the National Technical Institute including recentlyr
completed construction is sufficient for 800 students, bUt mainly due to in-
sufficient teachers and equipment (para. 3.16) present enrollment is only 40C,
Supply of equipment and expansion of existing facilities included in the
proposed project would enable the workshops and laboratories to be brought t.i
a satisfactory standard sufficient for the use of 1,130 students, but a
special teacher training program must also be developed (para. 6.15).
6.09      The proposed project would enable the private Colegio Salesiano
Santa Cecilia to expand from its present enrollment of 450 students to 600
students by providing much needed equipment. Existing buildings are of good
quality and suitable for the proposed expansion.
6.10      The private Instituto Tecnico Ricaldone has an enrollment of 50
students but could hold 200 students if existing buildings were provided with
the equipment included in the proposed project. The development would includ-It
a small technical teacher training department for an annual output of 30
teachers.
6.11      The Salvador Government has given assurances that private techni-
cal schools receive annually more than 100 scholarships which would allow
needy students to attend the senior secondary or teacher training courses.
The National School of Agriculture
6.12      This will train middle-level technicians and a limited number of
teachers in agriculture and enrollment would be expanded from 250 to 450 and
output from 75 to 130. The project would provide additional classrooms,
laboratories, workshops and general sciences facilities. Two dormitories art
required to accammodate the additional students who are recruited from all
parts of the country.  The proposed facilities and equipment are acceptable
and economic.
Staff
6.13      The proposed expansion of industrial, agricultural and commercial
education requires a unit for technical education within the Ministry, with
responsibility for the broad plan of development of technical education, A
department of secondary school supervision has therefore been created in
the Ministry to be officially inaugurated in 1969 with sub-units for technii-c2
education.  Six inspectors have been appointed and they will assist iii th)e
implementation of proposed project.



- 17 -
6.1,4     In order to ensure sound development of the sixteen senior second-
ary schools in the proposed project each will need an experienced and well-
trained principal. In El Salvador ther-e are inadequate number of persons
of such experience and because of this the proposed project Itnciudes fellow^-
ships for principals designated to enable them to study modei n methods of
school organization and management in special courses and during visits
abroad.
6.15      Assurances have been given by the Government of El Salvador that
secondary teacher training will be carried on as described in paras. 3.24
and 3.26. Funds have been included in the project for fellowships which
would allow about 75 teachers in practical subjects to attend courses par-
tially abroad of an approximate length of one year and designed to upgrade
their practical skills.  The Salvadorian government has informed the Bank
that the project schools will all be coinpletely staffed with full-time
teachers no later than 1975 and budgetary provision will be made to commence
this process in 1969,
6.16      The project includes one expert in agriculture education for 3
years who would assist in planning of workshops and laboratories and procuie-
ment of equipment.
6.17      A close cooperation between industry, agriculture and commerce an.d
the project schools is necessary in order to keep the practical courses up tc,
date and integrate the schools with employers. The government has agreed
during negotiations to form a national council with representatives from
private and public agencies. The council will advise on curricula, teacher
training, equipment, etc. and regularly visit project schools.
Costs
6.18      Estimated construction costs, based on standard designs and unit
prices derived from recent building experience, have been prepared for the
buildings in the proposed project (Annex 11). Ten percent price increase
allowance has been provided in the cost estimates of the project. Similariy,
an allowance of 10% of the estimate has been made as a contingency to acccmr-
modate unanticipated construction and site planning problems.
6.19      The foreign exchange component is estimated at about US,$4.9 millicn
equivalent or 58% of total costs, including equipment, furniture and inteaiest
and other related charges during construction. Imported materials form
about 20% of the construction cost and 50% of furniture cost. Almost none
of the instruction equipment required can be obtained in El Salvador.
Educational equipment would be imported free of duty.
6.20      The project would represent 25% of the investment program and it
would generate a recurrent cost of %7 million per year by 1975, representinTg
14% of the total estimated increase in public recurrent expenditures on
education between 1966-1975. Of the total increase in public recurrent
expenditures for secondary education, including the television developmert.
about 70% would result from the project.



- 18 -
5.D21     Expenditures for the project would be made over a five-year period.
Before actual construction starts, an estimated expenditure of about US$0.5
million would be incurred (for site surveys, professional fees, etc.).  Tne
government intends to spend about US$2.5 million in each of the three con-
struction years. After completion, an amount of US$0.3 million would be
wqithheld for the defects and liability period of nine monthsz During the
construction period monthlypayments should be made to the contractors ac-
cording to their certified program and the rate of disbursement during the
three years would be fairly uniform (Annex 12).
Toan
6.22      A Bank loan of US$4.9 million equivalent would equal the estimated
foreign exchange component and represent 58% of the total cost at US$8.4 millio;n
equivalent. It is expected that the government would 'oe able to finance the
remaining 42% or US$,3.5 million equivalent of capital expenditure.  The
loan would be disbursed for education equipment and for interest and related
charges      at 100% of the governmentts payments.  The cost of technical
assistance and fellowships would be reimbursed at 85%. Civil works contain
a foreign exchange component of 20% and furniture of 50% which would be re-
inbursed by the Bank.  Any funds that are undisbursed at the completion of
the project would be available for cancellation.
Building Construction
6.23      The building industry has in the last six years met the demand
without any unusual increase in material and labor costs except for the last
year, when there was a 10% increase. The yearly value of building work
throughout the country has increased since 1963 from US$13 million to US$17
million in 1966.  There are about 40 contracting firms on the government's
approved list.
6.24      There is no shortage of general labor, but skilled craftsmen are
much needed. Local and imported material are in adequate supply. In generals
the industry should have no difficulty in meeting the requirements of the
proposed project.
6.25      Tendering for all government building is administered by a Tender
Board in the Ministry of Works, which also appraises the contractors' quality
and capacity to undertake the project. Insurance of construction work is tbe
responsibility of the contractor, who will also be required to post a bond
as a guarantee against his failure to complete the work. Building contracts
would be awarded and furniture and equipment would be purchased after inter-
national competitive bidding.
6.26      Architectural design and building construction vary widely in El
Salvador. Outstanding quality can be seen, particularly in private housing
and some public buildings in San 3alvador, but most other buildings leave
'llch to be desired.  The Spanish style of architecture with thick, plastered
walls and low-pitched tile roofing which is predaminant in most of the
e.xisting construction work is, however, being replaced by concrete arid 8t`al
construction.



- 19 -
6.27      The government has built 1,600 primary classrooms (para. 3.08) and
completed six secondary schools in the last three years.  The construction
standards of these schools are adeq~uate and the costs are very reasonable.
The experience thus obtained would be used for the project.  The buildings
proposed for the project schools would have concrete block walls, louvered
glass windows and steel roof trusses with asbestos roofing, For acoustic
reasons the classrooms and laboratories would have suspended ceilings.
Schedules for accommodations follow economic space standards and are con-
sistent with functional needs. Capital costs (excluding contingencies) woulii
be US$210 equivalent per student place in schools without industrial or
agricultural options and US$320 equivalent in schools with those options.
6.28      The government does not provide any funds for maintaining school
buildings.  For the proposed project, the government has agreed to establish
a maintenance uni-t within the Kinistry of Education and to include in its
annual budget 1% per year of the replacement value of the buildings, which
is adequate for the proposed simple structures.
6.29      In the past there have not been any by-laws or building codes.
Three years ago, however, after a severe earthquake, a group of foreign
specialists drew-up building regulations which went into effect recently.
6.30      There are four main sources of architectural services:
(a)  the National Planning Council, which is responsible for the
execution of building projects proposed by the Ministries,
has its own architectural section;
(b) the Ministry of Education also has its own architectural
department wihich in the past has been responsible for the
design and construction of primary schools;
(c)  the Ministry of Public Works is responsible for all public
building works and in the past has been engaged in some
educational projects;
(d)  there are 14 architectural firms in the country.  Although
they are mainly engaged in design work for the private sec-
tor, some of them have experience in school building design.
The Implementation of the Project
6.31      The Ministry of Education has established a special unit
to implement the project consisting of a director., two architects, accep'G
able to the Bank, twio engineers, an educator, an accountant and adequate
supporting clerical staff.  The inspectors mentioned in para. 6.13 will
participate in project implementation.  The unit will prepare educational
specifications for the schools and design standard school plans and workingS
drawings in cooperation wiith architectural firms which are to adapt the
standard drawiings to the individual school sites.  The unit will give pa-
ticular consideration to the use of integrated instructional televizion -tu'



- 20 -
specifications and school designs and closely cooperate with the Miinistry's
television department. The unit will coordinate the design and supervision
work of the M4inistry of Education and the Ministry of Works. The various
other government departments will be asked to appoint officers with whom the
project unit will maintain contact in order to ensure coordination and inter-
change of information. The existing office for construction inspection in
the Ministry of Education will be used for the project. It is staffed with
sufficient and experienced building inspectors,.
7. CCNCLUSIONS AND RECMIDEMIATIONS
7.01      During the period 1967-1975 El Salvador's estimated requirement
for middle-level manpower is 88,500 persons with secondary education (para.
5.o6). In order to meet this demand the existing school facilities need to
be expanded (para. 5.09),
7.02      The proposed project would provide 15,500 new school places and
increase the annual output from the levels of secondary and post-secondary
education by about 4,700 graduates.  Frcm the higher of those levels 1,600
graduates would have vocational training.  The project would provide 321 of
all graduates froa public secondary schools,(Para. 6.03)
7.03      The project would raise the general standard of secondary education
and broaden the curriculum by providing modern school buildings with facili-
tuies for efficient teaching of science and vocational courses (paras. 6.o5,
6.07).
7.o4      The number of primary school leavers would be sufficient to provide
secondary school entrants of adequate quality (para. 3.08).
7.05      The supply of administrative staff and secondary teachers would be
sufficient if proposed training programs are fully implemented (parasc 3.2h.
3.26, 6.i3, 6.15).
7.o6      The project schools would be distributed throughout the country to
match demographic needs and reduce disparities between opportunities for
promotion from primary to secondary education (para. 6.o4).
7.07      School building designs would conform to acceptable standards and
ensure economic utilization. Furniture and equipment lists are adequate anid
economical (paras. 6.07-6.10, 6.12).
7.08      There is a sufficient number of competent contractors in E Salvalo:
to carry out the project.  No shortage exists of competent architects and
engineers but technical assistance would be needed for the agricultural-
education items in the proposed project. The government agreed during Loan
negotiations that private architects would assist in school design. (Paras.
6.16, 6.23, 6.24, 6.31)



- 21 -
7.09      International competitive bidding would be used for all procurkiient
in the proposed project (para. 6.25).
7.10      Satisfactory assurances have been obtained during negotiations that
the following actions will be taken by the Government of El Salvador:
(a)  Implementation of a new curriculum in secondary schools of
the project and investigation of examination content and
procedures in secondary education in an effort to reduce the
number of failures (paras. 3.10, 6.o5).
(b) Introduction of full-time teachers in all project schools
no later than 1975 and regular review and revision of the
quality of the staff as well as full implementation of the
proposed secondary teacher training program including a
television scheme (para. 6.15).
(c) Formation of a national council for industria1 agricultural,
and commercial education (para. 6.17).
7.11      The govermment has set up in the Ministry of Education, a project
unit for the execution of the proposed project consisting of the following
full-time staff: a project director and two architects acceptable to the
Bank, two engineers, an educator, an accountant and adequate supporting stalf
(para. 6.31).
7.12      The project forms a suitable basis for the proposed Bank loan of
US$4.9 million equivalent or about 58% of the project cost of US$8.4 millic¶x
equivalent. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$4.9 million equiva-
lent (para. 6.19).

iMEORANDUM ON RCENT ECONOIIC DEVE-DPEIMT
AND PP£SPF1TS OF EL SALVADOR
I. Summary and Conclusions
1.        The Bankls latest economic report which dealt with El Salvador
(VII163a3 "Economic Situation and Prospects of Central America'", dated
June 5, 1967) observed that in view of the impending decline in exports,
due to unfavorable world market conditions for the country's primary
products (coffee and cotton), substantially increased public investment
channelled primarily into agriculture and education were needed to
diversify the economy, pomote import substitution and stimulate new
exports. To achieve these objectives public sector savings would have
to be raised, import demand restrained, and new external finance obtained.
El Salvador was judged creditworthy for the US$130 million of new loan
commitments estimated to be needed during the 1967-1970 period, much of
whaich wras expected to be provided by official external lending institu-
tions.
2.        Not much was done to accelerate the development effort during
the past two years, in which Government energies were absorbed with
political consolidation and the preservation of the democratic processes.
The Government is now increasingly aware of the long-term problems of
the Salvadorian economy and appears more ready than before to act on
them. It recognizes the need for structural diversification, -with in-
dustries oriented more towards world markets and taking better advantage
of domestic resources and skills. It also now recognizes more clearly
the role to be played by the public sector through appropriate investment,
fiscal and credit policies, and hence the need for increasing fiscal
revenues and containing non-developmental current expenditures, to sustain
an adequate level of investment: new revenue measures wiere taken in 1968,
effort is now being made to improve tax administration, and the possibili-
ties of new fiscal measures at a later date are being studied.  However,
the political consensus needed to realize larger investment programs is
still uncertain. Although it is clear that a substantially stepped-up
investment effort cannot be financed from domestic sources alone and will
require additional external borrowing, there is considerable political
opposition to further borrowing by the Government. It is also not clear
how fast the Government will be able to move ahead in raising the needed
domestic resources and improving its administrative and technical capacity
to identify, prepare and implement investment projects in high priority
sectors. In El Salvador, financial and "physical" capacity improvements
are not independent: to the extent that good projects are proposed and
carried out, it will be easier to mobilize domestic and external savings;
conversely, adequate financing will make it possible to undertake and
complete the studies necessary to increase the project content of the
public investment program.



5;        In th5e expectation th.t the covenr,-mrxnrt irL1l b3 successful in
its e.*.re-ts t-  sHiSe it'e absorptive capacity of the pubic sector and
4'ae puT.lic savings required to support a larger investment effort, El
Sa2ador would continue to be creditworthy for the additional external
bonrowing that would be required. The present debt service ratio is be-
low 3 percent and is expected to reach about 6 percent in the late 19701s,
on the basis of existing and prospective borrowing.  axternal capital re-
quirements of the public sector for the 1969-1972 period are estimated to
amount to $20 million per year, on a disburseraent basis, if the investment
plan is successfully implemented. A full scale program that would address
itself adequately to the peculiarly difficult long-term problem of diver-
sifying an economy which is already very densely populated, has a rapidly
growing population and inadequate cultivable land would merit some conces-
sional finance to moderate the very sharp increase in public savings that
will be required to finance the expanded program and service a rapidly
expanding external debt.
II.  Recent Economic Developments
Production
4.        During the five-year period of 1962-66 the Salvadorian economy
experienced rapid growth, thanks to the expansion of coffee and to an un-
precedented boom in commerce and manufacturing caused by the creation of
the Central American Common Market. The average annual growth in GDP
during this period was over 7 percent (about 6 percent in real terms),
considerably higher than the 3.7 percent per annum rate of population
growth. This growth rate was, however, lower in the last two years
(1967-68) when it averaged only about 5 percent per year, in real terms
barely at and perhaps below the population growth of some 3.8 percent per
year. This recent slowing down of growth was caused by production diffi-
culties in cotton and marketing difficulties in sugar coinciding with a
drop in public investment.  Contrary to plans, the level of public in-
vestment expenditures decreased by about one-third during the two years
as a result of inadequate domestic and external finance and limited
capacity to prepare and izzplement projects. Only the industrial sector
continued to expand rapidly during 1967-68; it contributed sufficiently to
exports to permit, in conjunction with the restrictive import policy dis-
cussed below, the maintenance of foreign exchange reserve levels.
5.        Services account for over 50 percent of GDP, with "commerce"
alone representing some 25 percent of GDP. Their share has increased
since the creation of the Central American Common Mlarket. Over half of
the labor force, however, is still engaged in agriculture, even if
agriculture has been declining in importance. Although the proportions
fluctuate considerably from year to year, agricultural production ac-
counted in 1968 for about 26 percent of El Salvadorls Gross Domestic
Product against 32 percent in 1961.  During 1962-65, agricultural prod-
uction increased by 5.5 percent per year on average overall, or by 2.5
percent if the main export crops--coffee, cotton and sugar--are excluded.
6.        In 1966, a small decline in coffee and a sharp drop in cotton
output--due to pests, exaggerated expansion of production into marginal
lands and inappropriate use of insecticides and fertilizers--caused an
absolute reduction in total agricultural production.  In l96768,
agricultural output reglstered a modcst increase, largaly due to goDod



- 3 -
coffee crops and, in a lesser measure, to the expansion in cereals (corn
and rice), beans, fruits and vegetables, livestock and fishing.  The
cotton crisis, though, continued through 1968, with acreage and production
again in sharp decline. Since coffee output was substantially in ex-
cess of the quota assigned to El Salvador by the International Coffee
Organization, the country had to sell some 15 percent of its coffee to
"new markets'), reducing the average price received and coffee tax reve-
nues. A grave surplus problem developed also for sugar, whose unsold
stocks in the country increased substantially. They were estimated at
the end of 1968 at about 900 thousand quintals, equivalent to over
one-third of the average annual production and more than El Salvador's
average annual exports of sugar.
7.        The three main export products, coffee, cotton and sugar,
continue to account for some 50 percent of total value added in agri-
culture, as they did five years ago. Coffeels share has actually in-
creased from one-third to almost 40 percent between 1962 and 1968. No
major coffee diversification program has thus far been undertaken,
mainly because under present credit, fiscal and price policies, the
profitability of coffee has not yet been successfully challenged by any
other agricultural product. One of the most promising "newt' products,
rice, is already facing surplus problems, due in large part to improper
selection of the type of rice to be produced for export and to inadequate
marketing arrangements, with the result that the potentiality of Asian
markets cannot yet be tapped.
8.        Manufacturing production accounted in 1968 for 20 percent of
GDP, against just over 15 percent in 1961. The average rate of growth
in 1962-66 was 12 percent per year. In 1967-68, manufacturing continued
to be the most dynamic sector of the economy, although its rate of
growth, about 9 percent per year, was lower than in the earlier formative
years of the Central American Common Market wlich has provided a sizeable
market for Salvadorian manufacturers (only a very small amount of food-
stuffs and textiles is exported outside the area).  The most recent decline
in the rate of growth reflects a slowing down in neighboring countries
and the restrictive credit policy adopted because of balance of payments
problems.
9.        During the 1962-68 period, the industrial structure changed
considerably.  "New" industries, chemical and mechanical industries, in
particular, expanded more than twice as fast as the overall industrial
average.
Population
10.       Rapid population growth within a limited land area continues
to underline the need for sustained diversification of the E1 Salvadorian
economy. El Salvador has a population of some 3.3 million (mid 1968),
growing at an estimated 3.8 percent per year, and a density of 400 people
per square mile, making it the most densely populated country in Latin
America after Haiti. Population growth has been accelerating during the



1950ts as fertility rates increased considerably in most age brackets.
It is estimated that the acceleration in growth has continued after 1960,
the year of the last census. As a result, the number of non-working
people per economically active person (the dependency ratio) has increased:
about 47 percent of the total population is now estimated to be less
than 14 years old.
11.       Although no population policy exists officially, a private
Demographic Society, legally recognized since 1963, carries on a prografa
of education in faxily planning with the tacit consent of the public au-
thorities. The Society, a member of tlhe International Planned Parenthood
Federation, makes use of Government clinics and provides services to
over 40 thousand families, reaching some one thousand new families every
month. The University of San Salvador offers training courses in demo-
*         graphy and family planning.
Finance
12.       During 1962-66 total public investment increased from 2.L per-
cent of GDP in 1962 to 4.6 percent of GDP in 1966, reflecting significant
investments in needed power and transportation facilities. However, El
Salvador's public sector has proved unable in the last two years to sus-
tain a substantial investment effort and thus support adequately needed
structural changes in the economy and continued private sector expansion.
13.       One of the principal reasons for the poor public investment
performance has been the inadequacy of Central Government revenues and,
hence, public sector savings for the needs of the public sector.  Since
196h, when a substantial improvement in Government revenues took place
following the introduction of an income and excise taxes reform, total tax
receipts have stagnated. Direct tax revenues increased slightly (they
accounted in 1965-68 for only 15 percent of total tax revenues) but im-
port duty revenues declined due to the increasing proportion of duty-free
imports under the Industrial Promotion Iawi and from the rest of the Com-
mon I4arket.  Coffee export tax revenues also declined, because of lower
prices in the traditional markets and the export tax exemption granted to
exports to "new" markets. Public sector savings available for investment
have thus been falling.
14.       In 1968, thanks to administrative improvements and the increase
in the net worth tax, Central Government current revenues are estimated
to have increased by some 2 percent over the previous year. However, an
increase in current expenditures by over 8 percent--mainly for health and
education and transfers to autonomous institutions to which the previous
government had committed itself--resulted in another (25 percent) reduc-
tion in Central Government savings. Despite increases in the savings of
autonomous institutions, overall public savings in 1967-68 were some 10
percent below the 1965-66 level.



15.       One effect of this poor fiscal psrforrmance was that public in-
vestment fell in 1967-63 by over one-fifth below the levels of the previous
two years. Only about half of the origineIl1y programmed expenditures were
actually made, with tlhe rate of program achievement falling as low as 25
percent in the high priority agricultural sector; significant cuts also
took place in transportation, health and housing. But shortages of public
savings were not the only cause of this poor investment- performance,
Other causes were inade',uate technical and administrative capacity (which
resu'.ted in the prepar.ation of a vei-y siall number of investment projects
and in severe difficulties atv the implementation stage) and an inadequate
institutional and legal frameiork, e.g. failure to app.rove a drainage law
essential for a comprehensive irrigation program and difficulties encountered
by the Government in Parliament obtaining approval or ratification of loans,
caused by both political opposition and cumbersome legal procedures.  Fore-,.gn
borrowing has bee-n correspondingly low in the most re-ent years.  The pro-
portion of public investment financed net from abroad was about 15 percent
in 1967-68 compared to 32 percent of a higlher investment level in l965-66.
16.       The "pipelinett of external finance to the country is also now
unusually dry.  Undisbursed loans from the Washington based agencies
amounted to US$19 million at the end of 1968 aga-nst over US$43 million
at the end of 1965.
17.       TIonetary policies have been prudent throughout most of the
1960Ts, reflecting preoccupation with maintaining price stability and
avoiding foreign exchange difficulties. -The money supply expanded on
average by just above 5 percent per year. In 1966 there was substantial
credit expansion to both public and private sectors, and a sharp loss in
international reserves. But in the following year the Central Bank re-
versed its liberal credit policy towards the Government and the private
sector; raised commercial bank reserves from 20 percent to 30 percent of
deposits; reduced the &mount of trade credit froma 40 percent to 30 per-
cent of commercial bank's portfolios; imposed 100 percent prior deposits
for certain imports (the prior deposit require-ment was dropped after
approval of the Protocol of San Jose, at the end of 1968) and accelerated
payments for imported merchandise by reducing the permitted maturity of
import financing from abroad. The EIF has supported this credit restraint
policy by means of stand-by arrangements in 1965 and 1967.
18.       Althoughl current price indexes are inaccurate, prices appear
to have remained relatively st3ble:  the annual rate of price increase is
estimated to have been of the order of 1 to 2 percent. Minimum wage regu-
lations introduced to cover, first, farm workers and laborers hired for
harvesting the principal export crops, then, industrial workers and,
finally, government employees, have apparently not been very effectively
implemented.
19.       Since 1962 the Salvadorian balance of payments has had substan-
tial current accolumt deficits, with a peak in 1966 when the excess of im-
ports over exports of goods and services reached US$44 million, equivalent



- 6 -
to over 20 percent of total exports. The reason for these deficits was
not an inadequate increase in exports (between 1962 and 1966 exports in-
creased at a respectable average of 9g8 percent per year) but the fast
growth of imports (15 percent per year during 1962-66), especially of
intermediate and capital goods.  Until 1965, large inflows of official and
private capital more than offset the current account deficits and there
was accumulation of international reserves.  In 1966, however, although
capital inflows expanded substantially, the excessive credit expansion
caused reserves to fall by 25 percent, equivalent to one and a half
month's imports. In the last two years, large coffee exports and rapidly
growing exports of industrial goods to the other Central American countries,
together with slowly rising imports--because of tight credit and the sharp
drop in public investment expenditures--combined to reduce markedly the
cuTrrent account deficits and to avoid any further decline in reserves so
that at the end of 1968, net international reserves stood at US$41e0 Mil-
lion equivalent to about twlo months' imports. Total external public debt
outstanding, mainly long term, amounted to US$90 million (including un-
disbursed) at the end of 1968. The IBRD holds about 45 percent of this
debt. The debt service ratio is low, 2.9 percent, and has declined
slightly in recent years.
III. The Development Plan, 1968-1972
20.       The GovernmentIs present objectives, embodied in a five-year
development plan recently completed, indicate that it is aware of El
Salvador's principal development problems and intends to deal with them
more effectively than in the past. The target is to achieve a GDP growth
of 6 percent per year in real terms, or slightly over 2 percent per capita
annually, somewhat higher than the 5.5 percent overall and the 1.7 per
capita growth rate in 1963-67. This more rapid growth is to be achieved
in the face of less buoyant markets in the rest of Central America for
Salvadorian exports. Consequently, the Plan outlines a pattern of develop-
ment for the next five years that is characterized by a relatively more
important role than in the past of the public sector, while thie private
sector experiences a pause in its growth as the most important import
substitution possibilities are being exhausted. This is reflected in the
projected drop in the rate of growth of private investment and consumption
(a policy of import restraint is to be followed), while public investment
would recover sharply from the 1967-68 lows and current public expenditurest
growth would pick up slightly, more markedly in health and education.
The financial and physical capacity of the public sector is to be strength-
ened in order to bring about important structural changes through a stepped-
up, well designed public investment effort.
21.       According to the Plan, agriculture is expected to grow only
moderately during the next few years. Cotton acreage and output appear
to have finally reversed their declining trend and a significant recovery
is expected for the next few; years, thanks in part to the work of an
Israeli mission in plague and insect control and training in insecticide
use. But coffee output is not expected to increase much above the record
level reached last year, while sugar output should decline somewhat.



-7-
Accelerated growth is expected in the rest of the sector, especially for
rice, fruits and vegetables, livestock and fishing, which have shown in-
teresting possibilities in the last two years. Major irrigation works as
well as credit, marketing and storage facilities are planned to support
this growth. As a result, agricultural output overall is projected to
grow at 2.8 percent per year during 1968-1972, above the 1.9 percent
average of 1963-67.
22.       The future growth of the industrial sector depends in the
short term on the continuing overall economic growth in El Salvador and
in the rest of the Common Market. These two markets have been and still
are the ones which absorb virtually all the Salvadorian industrial out-
put. Some manufactured goods (foodstuffs, textiles) are currently ex-
ported outside the area, and the possibility of expanding their exports
to world markets, as well as developing new export lines is being explored,
but no significant results are expected soon. The Plan projects industrial
growth during 1968-1972 at 9.8 percent per year (compared with 12.5 percent
in 1963-67), with most of the growth taking place in the new intermediate
and mechanical industries. In view of the dynamism shown in recent years
by the Salvadorian entrepreneurs behind the CACI common external tariff,
this expected growth does not appear implausible.
23.       The Salvadorian authorities recognize that the recent drop in
public investment has had the two-fold negative effect of postponing the
diversification of the economy and--in the short run--of reducing the
levels of activity and employment. The Government has thus set sharply
increased public investment targets for 1969-1972 (about 75 percent
higher on a yearly basis than in 1967-68). The achievement of these
levels will require that current efforts to improve financial and physical
capacities of the public sector (including project preparation capacity)
are successful.
24.       Nhile both sectoral and overall targets of the plan appear
realistic and the public investment prograra has a high project content,
ssuostantial work rermains to be done to put most of the projects in
"bankable" shape and measures have yet to be taken to ensure adequate
finance for the expanded program. The actual level of public invest-
ment and growth of GDP will thus most probably turn out to be below
targets, as they were in 1968.
25.       At the end of 1968 El Salvador approved the Prot=l of San Jose
which called for a 30 percent surcharge on most imports from outside
Central America. The yield is estimated at around uS$4.5 iYiLllion per year,
or 5 percent of 1968 Government current revenues. This measure, comple-
mented by the improvements being made in tax administration and by the
rising savings of the autonomous public agencies, is expected to result
in a substantial recovery in public savings in 1969 which should be
adequate to sustain the increased level of public investment programmed
for 1969. However, if investment targets for later years are to be met,
direct taxes will have to be made to play a more significant role than
at present so that tax revenues can become more responsive to income
growth than they are now.



- 8 -
26.       Other measures will also have to be taken if the planned program
is to be realized.  The Government intends to improve substantially the
administrative and technical capability of the individual Ministries and
of the various entities responsible for the implementation of the public
investment program, and good progress is being achieved in some sectors
(e.g. education).  But the job that the Government faces is a ver-y diffi-
cult one. Constitutional ways to speed up the process of legislative ap-
proval and ratification of development loans from abroad are also being
solght.  But the solution of this essentially political difficulty will
depend ultimately on the ability of the Government and the opposition
parties to agree that short-term political issues must not be permitted
to continue to frustrate Government development initiatives.
27.       To achieve its investment targets, the Government intends to
make greater use of external capital to finance its increased investment
0         expenditures, According to the Government program, El Salvadorts public
sector would require new development finance from abroad in the order of
US$20 million per year (on a disbursement basis), over the next four years.
Disbursement rates would thus be well above those of the recent past,
when disbursements averaged about US$13 million per year, in 1963-67. If
these were to materialize, the debt service ratio, calculated on reasonably
conservative assumptions about terms of the additional borrowing, would
double in the next decade and peak at about 6 percent in the late 1970 s,
on the basis of the existing outstanding debt plus the planned 1969-1972
borrowing.  By 1972 net foreign capital is planned to finance some 37
percent of public investment or 27 percent on average for the whole period
1968-1972.
28.       The plan projects steadily increasing external current account
deficits until 1972. Exports would increase at 7.5 percent per year (com-
pared with 8.5 percenat during 1963-67) with the highest rates for chemical
and miscellaneous manufactured products (to the rest of the Central
American Common IIarket) and cotton. An export prorotion center has been
recently established to try to open new lines of exports to world markets.
Import growth is expected to average around 6.5 percent per year during
the period (compared with 12 percent during 1963-67)o These trade projec-
tions, particularly the one concerning imports and the plan forecast of
large private and public capital inflows resulting in a steady build-up
of international reserves, to a 1972 level about 50 percent above 1968,
appear optimistic.
29.       Monetary policy is to continue to be prudent, with an increase
in money supply at or below the rate of increase in GDP. Bank credit
would be mainly for highi priority, directly productive sectors, with only
a limited amount of credit allowed for commerce and for financing of the
public investment programa Consideration is being given to a new banking
law and to the creation of an agricultural development bank which wo-uld
channel domestic and foreign capital towards agriculture. One important
issue is the revision of the interest rates level and structure that are,
at present, not conducive to adequate mobilization of private savings and
their allocation among the priority sectors of the economy.



- 9 -
30.       The plants declared aim of reducing the mortality rate would
result in increasing further thle rate of population growth.  Since popu-
lation density and growth are already very high, careful attention would
have to be given by the Salvadorian Authorities to formulating and im-
plementing a comprehensive program of education in family planning; thus
providing the prerequisites for some slowdown in population growth.
IV. Conclusions
31.       In its 1968-72 development plan the Salvadorian government has
defined its major development objectives and how it intends to achieve
them. It has also begun to talce steps to implement its intentions. How-
ever, the very substantial effort called for, which has controversial and
difficult domestic political implications, has yet to crystallize.
32.       With the overall policies that have been followed by the Salvadorian
authorities, El Salvador's creditworthiness has not been in question.  But
the country's recent development performance has been disappointing. There
are now prospects for a considerably improved public investment performance:
since increasing attention is being given to raising the absorptive capacity
of the public sector.  El Salvador should continue to be creditworthy for
the additional external borrowing that such an accelerated development
effort would require, if the savings ability of the public sector is sub-
stantially increased; even so, El Salvador wiould merit some concessional
finance to mitigate the very sharp increase in public savings that will
be required to finance the stepped-up public investment expenditures and
service the rapidly expanding external debt.
