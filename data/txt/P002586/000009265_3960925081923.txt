PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUDAN
SECOND PORT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1233-SU)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Second Port
Project in Sudan, for which Credit 1233-SU in the amount of SDR 21.5
million was approved on April 20, 1982. The Credit was closed on June
30, 1988, two years behind schedule. With the payment of the last
application dated October 25, 1988, the Credit was closed and the
undisbursed balance of SDR 1,033,520.08 was cancelled as of December 31,
1988.
2.    The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Division of the East
Africa Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). The
Borrower did not submit Part II.
3.    Preparation of this PCR was started at headquarters in February
1991, but had to be postponed until further essential information could
be gathered, particularly with regard to port traffic. The PCR is
based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan, Guarantee,
and Project Agreements; supervision reports; correspondence between the
Bank and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SUDAN
SECOND PORT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1233-SU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.    The project was designed to provide adequate capacity to handle
projected traffic until at least the late 1980's, with particular
emphasis on providing for facilities that would allow an adequate ro-ro
and container handling operation. Upgrading of the grain handling
facilities as well as edible oil lines were also included. Technical
assistance and training, which under the First Port Project was focused
on financial management and accountancy, store management and mechanical
equipment maintenance, was designed to continue efforts made during the
First Project and also to cover port administration and operations as
well as equipment maintenance and repairs of cargo handling equipment
required to cater for increased container traffic.
Implementation Experience
2.    Implementation of the project was expected to take three years and
be completed by the end of 1985. Due to initial delays in credit
effectiveness, foundation problems more serious than anticipated, delays
in decision on technical assistance program and procurement issues, the
closing date of the project was extended by two years.
Results
3.    The project was based on a conservative traffic forecast compared
to previous forecasts after the reopening of the Suez Canal, but still
envisioned a rapid development of container traffic. At the time it was
being decided whether to proceed with the Second Port Project, it was
uncertain if the development of Suakin about 60 km. south of Port Sudan
as a new container port would materialize soon after the proposed
completion of the second project. Seen from this perspective, the
project was necessary to provide adequate capacity to handle container
traffic, although the rapid development of containerization did not
materialize as predicted. The rate of containerization, 6.7% in 1982,
was estimated to increase to around 20% in 1988; the actual rate in 1988
was 13.8%.
Sustainability
4.    The recalculated ERR for the project is zero, even using
optimistic future traffic growth projections because of the decline in
Sudanese foreign trade. The project did, however, achieve its physical
objective of providing capacity to handle projected traffic,
particularly container and ro-ro traffic. The project was consistent
with priorities set for the sector and did increase the efficiency of
port operations.
Findings and Lessons Learned
5.    Due to the serious foundation problems encountered, the completion
of berths 16, 17 and 18 was delayed and caused a substantial cost



- iii -
increase. It also hampered the progress of the project as well as the
cargo handling activities, particularly container handling. This
occurred despite the additional borings made on the Bank's advice to
ensure reliable data for design purposes in advance of the construction
works. The lesson learned from this experience is that even when
adequate provision for engineering investigations has been made in
advance of project implementation, there is always a risk that the tests
will turn out to be inaccurate. This is particularly so in the redesign
of existing structures. This highlights the importance of making
adequate provision for physical contingencies in such circumstances.
Contingency funds would have fallen short if there had not been cost
underruns on other components.
6.    Lack of adherence to the Bank's procedures on the part of SPC
created delays in the processing of the project and also cancellation of
a few components. A procurement workshop in Sudan carried out by IDA
staff would have been useful. It would also have been better if
supervision missions could have been carried out on a more regular basis
in order to assist in procurement issues instead of relying on extensive
correspondence via telex.

Sector                : Transport
Sub-Sector            : Ports
2. Background
2.01     Port Sudan is Sudan's deep-water port, located on an inlet from
the Red Sea, and adjoins the City of Port Sudan. The main general cargo
handling berths are situated on the east side of the harbor comprising
11 berths (1-11). The South Quays comprise 4 berths (15-18) on the
southern side of the port near the harbor entrance (Map IBRD 13081R2).
2.02     In 1975, when the Suez Canal re-opened after 8 years closure,
and in anticipation of increased traffic development and growth of the
Sudanese economy, the Bank financed (under Credit 457-SU) consultant
services to determine investment requirements for Port Sudan. At about
the same time the Sudanese Government requested German assistance to
finance a feasibility study of new port development at Suakin, about 60
km south of Port Sudan. Both studies were completed in 1977. On the
basis of the traffic forecasts and the development of handling methods
envisaged, the Bank concluded that even with investments in Port Sudan,
Suakin construction would be justified, for operation by 1990.
2.03     The First Port Credit (Cr. 781-SU, effective February 2, 1979,
closing date June 30, 1983) financed a substantial investment program
consisting of the extensive paving of cargo handling areas, cargo
handling equipment, pallet making equipment and technical assistance.
Provision was also made for improving deep water berth 16 to facilitate
handling ro-ro vessels with stern ramps, and berths 17-18 to accommodate
container traffic. However, the costs of the civil works bids were much
higher than estimated and a few components had to be deferred, and were
subsequently included in the Second Port Project.
2.04     At appraisal of the Second Project in November 1980, 'it was the
view of the Bank that the justification for investment in Suakin was no
longer valid, since (i) traffic at Port Sudan had grown more slowly than
predicted; (ii) productivity at Port Sudan had improved as a result of
the First Project; and (iii) unitization of general cargo traffic had
increased.
3. Proiect Obiectives and Description
3.01     In the development of the strategy for the second port project
it was still uncertain whether the Government intended to construct the
new Port of Suakin. It was therefore agreed between the Bank and the
Government during negotiations for the Credit that, until completion of
the project, the Sea Ports Corporation (SPC) would not undertake any
other investment directly related to the expansion of Sudan's port
capacity, unless supported with evidence satisfactory to the Bank that
such investment was economically and financially justified.
3.02     Attention was consequently focused on designing a project to
cater for the rapidly increasing container traffic and still be
compatible with future needs whether the Port of Suakin was developed or
not. On this basis, the Second Port Project was to provide adequate
capacity to handle projected traffic until at least the late 1980's,



-2-
with particular emphasis on facilities that would allow adequate ro-ro
and container handling operation, as well as reinstating components
deferred from the first project, including: (i) grain silo upgrading;
(ii) the completion of the edible oil and molasses lines and portions of
the pavement wearing courses; and (iii) essential improvements to the
port internal communication system, including the ability to communicate
with the ships in the immediate vicinity of Port Sudan.
3.03     The Second Port Project consisted of:
(a)   improvements to berths 17/18 for container handling;
(b)   improvements to berth 16 for ro-ro and container handling;
(c)   improvements to the grain silo at berth 15;
(d)   improvements to existing paved storage areas;
(e)   improvements to the telephone and radio communication system
within the port and its approaches;
(f)   improvements to the electrical power system;
(g)   modifications to the edible oils and molasses pipelines;
(h)   provision of technical assistance in port operations, financial
management, accounting, equipment maintenance and training of
selected SPC staff;
(i)   consulting services for detailed engineering and supervision of
works (a-g);
(j)   consulting services for detailed engineering and supervision of
SPC Headquarters; and
(k)   construction of a Headquarters Building in Port Sudan.
4. Project Design and Organization
4.01     An increase in traffic and the growth of the Sudanese economy
was anticipated, partly due to the re-opening of the Suez Canal in 1975.
Therefore, the Bank and bilateral donors provided funding for
consultancy services to determine the need for additional investments at
Port Sudan as well as to carry out a feasibility study of new port
development at Suakin.
4.02     At the time of appraisal there was a clear conceptual
foundation for the Second Port Project, based on revised traffic
projections. Project designers were also aware of the severe
operational constraints at Port Sudan, particularly with regard to grain
handling and container operations, causes of the shortage of funds to
complete the first project.
4.03     The Project was well prepared and its timing appropriate,
mainly because studies and design for civil works had been carried out
under the first project and bids had been received for required civil
and electrical works.
4.04     SPC was responsible for the implementation of the project as it
was for the First Project. A Project Director was appointed to
supervise the overall project, while a consultant was appointed to
assist in the supervision of civil and electrical works as well as
detailed engineering and design of different components. The
appointment of the consultant was a condition for credit effectiveness.

5. Proiect ImDlementation
Civil Works
5.01     It was anticipated at appraisal that the civil works would have
commenced in June 1982. Due to delays in Board Presentation and credit
effectiveness, the main works did not commence until early 1983.
5.02     The contractor made excellent progress in mobilization and
setting up his plant and installations, although delay in the advance
payment caused cash flow problems. Because of more serious foundation
problems than anticipated, however, the completion of berth 16 was
seriously hampered and work on berths 17 and 18 was delayed. Soft
ground and/or soft coral instead of the hard coral anticipated from the
test borings resulted in extensive re-evaluation of the foundations for
berths 16, 17 and 18. At berth 16, the problem was further aggravated
by vibration during pile driving, which caused some damage to the
existing structure of berth 16. These unforeseen problems led to the
redesign of piles on berths 17 and 18 and completion of berth 16 was
suspended about 108 meters from the eastern end. Piledriving to
complete the whole berth to join up with the ro-ro ramp and adjoining
berths 17/18 would have entailed an unacceptable risk of damage to
existing structures. After further investigations and analysis it was
decided that completion of berth 16 could be undertaken by replacing the
part of berth 16 that had shifted with a deck of piles instead of the
existing columns and footings, and by the provision of two additional
lines of piles. The contractor carried out work on the redesigned berth
16 under a variation order to the main contract.
5.03     The problems caused by the soil conditions resulted in a
substantial cost increase for these components and serious delays in
completion of the works.  Furthermore, these delays resulted in hampered
container operations, although the flow of containers through the port
was not affected to any significant extent. Construction work on berths
16, 17 and 18 was satisfactorily completed in late 1985, eight months
behind schedule.
5.04     A short period after the three berths were put into operation
it was discovered that a large number of rubber fenders were damaged.
SPC requested the approval of the Bank to procure replacement fenders
directly from two different suppliers. This approval was eventually
granted and the damaged fenders were replaced.
5.05     Late delivery of asphalt caused some delays to surfacing of the
open area behind berth 18, which work was completed by March 1986.
5.06     Construction of the edible oil lines was completed at an early
stage of the contract without any major problem.
5.07     The construction of SPC headquarters building, carried out by a
local contractor, was also included in the project although this work
was financed by SPC. Detailed engineering and supervision, however, was
carried out by the consultant supervising the overall civil works, and
payments for these services were drawn from the credit. Progress on
this work was very slow, mainly because of scarcity of foreign exchange
to import required materials. The headquarters building was eventually
completed in 1989 and SPC moved in to the new offices in October, 1989.
Grain Silo Improvements and Electrical Power System
5.08     Orders for equipment and materials were placed in October 1982
and works started on site around June, 1983. In early 1984, after the
completion of approximately 95% of the works, the electrical contractor
for the grain silo improvements and the power supply system went into



-4-
receivership. The uncompleted work mainly involved the commissioning of
rectifiers and generators.
5.09     In 1985 the SPC entered into an agreement with a new contractor
to complete the works left unfinished by the defunct contractor. After
completion of the unfinished work by the new contractor, however, the
commissioning test revealed that the transformer of the ship unloader
was defective and needed replacement. After rectification of this
problem it was found that the elevator system was not able to achieve
the design capacity of 200 tons/hour, and a dispute arose between SPC
and the contractor over responsibility to rectify this shortcoming. In
an effort to help resolve the dispute, the Government of Lower Saxony
financed the services of an independent expert to render his opinion as
to the reason for the deficiency. The expert, however, was able to
correct the shortcoming, and eventually the system performed to its
design capacity.
5.10     The project included supply and installations of D.C. stand-by
generators for quay cranes and A.C. stand-by generators for the grain
silo, the main quays and the south quays, together with transformers and
other related equipment. The system was successfully installed during
1985.
5.11     The dispute with the second contractor, whose claim amounted to
97,000 Sterling Pounds, was eventually resolved in April 1989, when the
parties agreed to settle the claim at 55,000 Pounds Sterling. SPC had
obtained the understanding from the Bank to keep the credit open until
March 31, 1989 to settle this claim. Unfortunately it was unable to
meet this deadline and the credit was closed. SPC had to meet this
payment from its own resources.
Radio and Telecommunication
5.12     The first invitation for bids for the provision of telephone
and radio communications was sent in late 1984 to six short-listed
suppliers, but no proposals were submitted. A new invitation was
advertised for international competitive bidding in April 1985 and the
lowest bid exceeded the estimated cost by around US$ 0.7 million. A
request by SPC to reallocate funds from the credit to finance the
contract was considered by the Bank subject to SPC signing an agreement
with GTZ for the extension of training proposed and its financing by
other agencies. It was found, however, that the evaluation of the bids
for the telephone and radio exchange was not carried out in accordance
with bank guidelines, and SPC was requested to reevaluate the bids.
This reevaluation took such a long time that the validity of the bids
expired and the suppliers refused to extend their bids. The Bank agreed
to a new re-tendering in October 1986 and suggested that the documents
be updated by the consultant supervising the overall works within the
port project. The consultant, however, refused to review the documents
until SPC paid his outstanding invoices.
5.13     Finally, against the Bank's advice, SPC decided to proceed with
implementation of this component by separating the purchase of telephone
related hardware from the installation of the system, and it negotiated
with the Telecommunications Corporation of Sudan to undertake the
network distribution and cabling. Because these procurement
arrangements did not meet the Bank's requirements, the procurement of
this component could not be financed by the Credit and the corresponding
amount was eventually cancelled.



-5-
Technical Assistance and Training
5.14     Under the First Port Project, training was provided in Port
Sudan with respect to financial management and accountancy, stores
management and mechanical equipment maintenance. A ports training
center for theoretical and practical instruction was also established.
5.15     The aim of this project was to continue the training efforts
already commenced under the first project and to cover those areas not
included there.
5.16     In 1983, SPC had received a grant from the Government of Lower
Saxony of the Federal Republic of Germany of about USS 280,000 (DM
800,000)' to finance 30 man-months of technical assistance and the
provision of some equipment and learning aids. This grant supported
supervisory training in engineering disciplines and cargo handling, and
was administered by GTZ.
5.17     GTZ was also the executing agency for the operation of the
vocational school in the town of Port Sudan (which in large part is for
the benefit of the port), which was also financed under the Lower Saxony
program. It was therefore agreed that the Bank-funded prosram would be
coordinated with that of Lower Saxony to utilize GTZ facilities and
resources efficiently.
5.18     A contract was signed in January 1985 with GTZ for the
provision of experts for technical assistance and training financed from
the Credit and by Lower Saxony. The scope of the technical assistance
was 110 man-months in the areas of cargo handling, workshop planning and
organization and equipment operation and maintenance. The Credit
financed 75 man-months of the technical assistance and 35 man-months
were financed by Lower Saxony under an additional grant of DM 640,000
(about USS 215,000). The personnel to carry out the technical
assistance were seconded mainly from the Port of Bremen, and a team of
eight experts reported for duty in February 1985.
5.19     During the implementation of the technical assistance program,
and after a review of possible adjustments needed, it was concluded that
some additional positions were required and that an extension of the
program was desirable. This included some additional training materials
and equipment for both the training center and for the on the job
training. Although in full agreement with the need for this additional
technical assistance, SPC was reluctant to enter into an agreement with
GTZ in advance of full knowledge of the cost of the radio and
telecommunication system and the likely contribution of the Lower Saxony
Government to meeting the additional cost of an expanded program.
Eventually, in April 1986, SPC formalized the extension of 26 man-months
to be financed from the Credit, and in July 1986 an agreement was signed
with GTZ for the provision of 36 man-months to be financed by the
Government of Lower Saxony.
5.20     A study was financed from the Credit to analyze the SPC
proposed computerization program. Review of its recommendations showed
that the computerization program SPC wished to implement required costly
software development and technical assistance beyond the scope of the
project, and did not appear to be an operational means for computerizing
SPC's accounts. SPC subsequently revised its computerization program
and requested that a computer expert with experience in port operations
be provided under the technical assistance program to be funded either
from the Credit or by the Government of Lower Saxony. The Bank agreed
to finance the expert and approved Terms of Reference, but due to delays
in the recruitment process the Credit was closed before the expert was
appointed, and hence could not be financed from tthe Credit.



-6-
5.21     Total technical assistance to the project amounted to 172 man-
months over the period February 1985 to June 1987. 101 man-months were
financed from the Credit and 71 man-months by the Lower Saxony
Government, in addition to 30 man-months initially provided in 1983.
5.22     Overseas training of SPC staff in accounting, financial
forecasting and management, purchasing, port operations and general
management were financed under the Credit and organized by Crown Agents.
The package administered by Crown Agents included 15 staff members
attending courses in U.K., a five weeks Supply Management course in Port
Sudan, the administration of payments for SPC staff attending courses at
the Arab Maritime Academy as well as at training centers in West Germany
and Holland.
6. Project Results
6.01     During the period of project implementation FY1981-88, SPC
managed to produce net profits and generate positive cash flows from
operations, although they lagged somewhat behind appraisal estimates
2/. SPC's revenues remained between LSd3l million and LSd36 million
during FY1981-83, declined to LSdl6 million in FY1987 and increased to
LSd22 million in FY1988, compared with the steady increase in revenues
projected at appraisal, to LSd4O million in FY1987. Its net profits
increased from LSdl9 million in FY1981 to LSd22 million in FY1983,
compared with estimates of LSdl5 million and LSdlO million,
respectively, at appraisal. From FY1984 through FY1986, its net profits
declined to LSd6 million but thereafter increased to LSdl2 million in
FY1987 compared with LSdlO million estimated in the SAR. SPC's cashflow
from operations was positive during project implementation: however, it
was not sufficient to meet financial covenants which required SPC to
cover its operational expenses, part of capital investments and debt
services.
6.02     SPC's profits and positive cashflow were attributable to SPC's
ability to reduce its operational expenses and sustain its revenues in
the face of strong inflationary pressure. While inflation exceeded 30%
p.a. during the period of FY1980-88, SPC was able to increase its
revenues on average by 27% p.a. in nominal terms. SPC's operational
expenses decreased drastically from LSdl2 million in FY1981 to LSd7
million in FY1987, resulting in an operational margin of 66% in FY1987
compared with the appraisal estimate of 52 percent. This performance
saved the SPC from serious financial problems resulting from lack of
expected growth in throughput during the period.
6.03     Economic benefits which were assessed in the economic
evaluation of the SAR included: a) unitized traffic benefits which can
be calculated based on the reduction in surcharge and insurance costs;
b) grain silo benefits which can be accounted for by the savings in
export shipping time at berth; and c) power supply benefits which are
represented by savings in port operating time. Based on economic costs
of US$32 million, the economic rate of return was estimated to be 23% at
the time of Appraisal.
6.04     During the implementation period, unitized traffic benefits did
not materialize, since total waiting time was not reduced because of the
delay in construction and operational problems. Grain silo benefits did
not fully materialize because of the poor overall performance of dry

1980 constant Sudanese Pounds by using CPI (INTERNATIuNAL FINANCIAL
STATISTICS, IMF, 1992 APRIL), in order to compare actual results with
SAR estimates which were made in constant Sudanese Pounds.

bulk and general cargo, whose volumes were less than half of SAR
estimates in the FY1984-91 period. Only power supply benefits
materialized, albeit later than expected. Economic costs of project
were not significantly different from the SAR estimates.
6.05     Based on the delays in construction, poor performance of export
and un-materialized or partially realized economic benefits, the
economic rate of return was re-estimated to be about zero using
optimistic projections of import and export traffic. Unless country
economic performance improves, project economic benefits are not likely
to recover the economic costs of the project.
7. Proiect Sustainability
7.01     Notwithstanding the low recalculated ERR, the project did
provide capacity for SPC to handle increased container traffic as well
as improving the grain handling facilities. In retrospect, the timing
of the project was not appropriate given the unforeseen decline in
Sudanese foreign trade. Despite substantial operational difficulties
caused by the construction of the container facilities, the project did
significantly improve the handling of containers and grain.
8. Bank Performance
8.01     The Second Port Project was prepared in a rather short time by
SPC. Bank staff provided necessary assistance to ensure successful
implementation, particularly at critical stages, such as when problems
occurred on the foundation for the quay structures and in the design of
the Technical Assistance and Training components. Due to staff
constraints and transfers, however, supervision missions were not always
made on a regular basis by component specialists, although Bank staff
during different transport missions did make visits to SPC to maintain a
close and direct contact with the executing agency.
9. Borrower Performance
9.01     SPC was fully committed to successful implementation of the
project and adequate resources were assigned to the project for the
execution of all project components. With regard to procurement,
however, that lack of familiarity with or attention to Bank guidelines
caused significant delays in project implementation as well as
cancellation of the radio and telecommunication equipment component and
a delay in the settlement of the electrical contractors claim. SPC's
delay in processing with the Technical Assistance and Training component
delayed the project and caused some discontinuity in this important
component.
9.02     SPC breached a covenant in the Credit Agreement (and in the
Project Agreement as well) when it proceeded with the development of
passenger and livestock facilities at Old Suakin (not the proposed New
Suakin container facilities) without first providing the Bank with
satisfactory evidence showing that the investment was economically and
financially justified. The Bank was not aware that this project was
being undertaken until it was almost complete and threfore could not use
its remedies under the Credit Agreement to try to stop the investment.
The view of SPC was that this investment aimed at improving existing
installations and operations rather than expansion of capacity and so
did not violate the Credit covenant. SPC agreed to undertake a
cost/benefit analysis for review and comment by the Bank, which was
provided in September, 1987, but was not satisfactory. The total
investment in Old Suakin amounted to Sudanese Pounds 70 million (34% in
foreign currency) and the port started operations on April 22, 1991 but
it is unlikely to provide a return on the investment.

10.   Pro!iect relationshio
10.01    The productive and smooth collaboration which existed from the
beginning of the project gradually deteriorated after the completion of
the main civil and electrical works, and it became difficult and time-
consuming to reach agreement on the technical assistance and training
program as well as remaining procurement issues. SPC showed greater
interest in preparing a third project than in the timely completion of
the ongoing Second Port Project.
11.   Consulting Services
11.01    The original studies and engineering, final engineering and
supervision of the construction for the project (as for the first
project) was carried out by the same consultant. Its performance was
considered to be satisfactory until the problems with the soil
investigations and pile foundations arose. Although additional borings
were carried out, at the Bank's request, to ensure reliable data for
design purposes in advance of the construction works, and in spite of
conclusions of the consultant that the results were adequate for design,
serious problems did arise causing delays and increased costs. Although
this might be taken to indicate less than satisfactory performance,
there was no evidence of any negligence by the consultant. It must be
remembered that the consultant was not responsible for the additional
borings, as these were part of the contractor's scope of work, and even
these borings did not disclose the nature of the subsurface conditions.
Considering the difficulty involved in identifying the problem and the
totality of the services provided by the consultant and its very
cooperative assistance in the redesign of the structures, its overall
performance has to be rated satisfactory.
12.   Lessons Learned
12.01    Due to the serious foundation problems encountered, the
completion of berths 16, 17 and 18 was delayed and caused a substantial
cost increase. It also hampered the progress of the project as well as
the cargo handling activities, particularly container handling. This
occurred despite the additional borings made on the Bank's advice to
ensure reliable data for design purposes in advance of the construction
works. The lesson learned from this experience is that even when
adequate provision for engineering investigations has been made in
advance of project implementation, there is always a risk that the tests
will turn out to be inaccurate. This is particularly so in the redesign
of existing structures. This highlights the importance of making
adequate provision for physical contingencies in such circumstances.
Contingency funds would have fallen short if there had not been cost
underruns on other components.
12.02    Lack of adherence to the Bank's procedures on the part of SPC
created delays in the processing of the project and also cancellation of
a few components. A procurement workshop in Sudan carried out by IDA
staff would have been useful. It would also have been better if
supervision missions could have been carried out on a more regular basis
in order to assist in procurement issues instead of relying on extensive
correspondence via telex.
13.   Project Documentation and Data
13.01    The PCR was prepared from data contained in the project files,
information provided by SPC and MOT in general during IDA supervision
missions and from a follow-up mission in July 1991 to gather missing
information with regard to traffic data from port operations -
particularly container and ro/ro traffic - as well as final cost data
for the project components.
