KRISHNA-GODAVARI PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2205-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Krishna-Godavari
Petroleum Exploration Project for which Loan 2205-IN in the amount of US$165.5
million to India and onlent to the Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) was
approved on October 19, 1982. The original loan closing date of March 31,
1986 was extended three times to March 31, 1989. It was fully disbursed on
September 20, 1989.
The PCR was prepared by the Transport and Energy Operations Division
of Country Department IV of the Asia Regional Office (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Part I and Part III) and by ONGC (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final super-
vision mission of the project during March 1990 and is based, inter alia on
the President's Report, the Loan and Project Agreements, supervision reports
and internal Bank memoranda.

KRISHNA-GODAVARI PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2205-IN)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Objectives
The principal objectives of the project were to (i) focus and
accelerate ONGC's activities in those specific areas of the Krishna-Godavari
basin where past exploration had identified highly promising potential for
commercially exploitable oil and gas reserves; (ii) assist ONGC in verifying
this potential through further seismic surveys and exploratory drilling; and
(iii) enhance ONGC's exploration capabilities under the very difficult
geological and environmental conditions in the Krishna-Godavari project area.
Implementation ExReriences
Project implementation took three years longer than had been
planned. At least half of the delay was due to an increase in project scope
to utilize eligible Bank funds which otherwise would have had to be cancelled.
(The number of wells was increased from 28 to 50, and there was a correspond-
ing increase in the seismic work.) Ex:essive procurement difficulties, a
chronic ONGC problem, and the time required to resolve the eligibility of Bank
financing of certain drilling operations were other major delaying factors. A
serious implementation shortcoming was due to poor coordination between the
availability of seismic results and drilling equipment. To keep drilling
equipment engaged, it often became necessary to start drilling in locations
not fully covered by the latest seismic data (Part I, para. 5.1).
Two important decisions were made during implementation: (i) to add
to the number of exploration wells as indicated above and (ii) to decline to
add costly deepwater "outer continental shelf" wells, recognizing that the
initial appraisal drilling results did not indicate sufficient reserves for
economic development in this costly environment (Part I, para. 5.3).
Results
The project, with the help of che expanded project scope, achieved
its principal objectives. The pertinent results were:
(a) The exploration and appraisal drilling had a success rate of 32% and
68% respectively and exceeded industry worldwide experience (Part I,
para. 6.2 (a);
(b) The finding cost of new reserves is estimated to be US$2.50 per
equivalent barrel of oil which is slight ., bove the current average
in frontier areas, but significantly below the purchase price of in-
ground reserves in developed areas (Part I, para. 6.2 (b); and



iii
(c) The internal economic rate of return from the project is 10% based
on yearend 1989 recoverable zeserves estimates and production fore-
casts. Since then, recoverable reserves estimates have been
increased by 30% and production rates by 20-25%. These increases
along with the increased utilization of existing development and
infrastructure investments are expected to improve the economic rate
of return significantly.
Sustainabilitv
Prospects are good that the production of new petroleum resources
will be sustainable and profitable. The country will benefit from the foreign
exchange savings and ONGC should make an adequate rate of return on its
forward investments. To maximize these benefits i s important for ONGC to
temporarily curtail its exploration and appraisal invuotments until the
results of the project are fully assimilated and evaluated. A prudent and
cost effective plan should be adopted for the cc-itinued exploration and
development of the Krishna-Godavari ba-in (Part I, para. 7.1).
Lessons Learned
The main lessons learned from the project are:
(a) The heavy front end exploration and development investment cost
associated with the finding of new petroleum reserves makes it
essential to be highly selective in exploratory drilling, i.e. in
drilling only those wells which will contribute most to the program
and in appraising and developing commercial discoveries
expeditiously (Part I, para. 6.2 (c); and
(b) Project planning must include adequate lead time for the acquisition
ard processing of essential seismic data to avoid costly standby
charges for idle drilling equipment or drilling in locations
without adequate seismic support (Part I, para. 5.1).

2.   Background
2.1       Despite rapid development of its giant Bombay High oil field, India
was importing 56% of its petroleum requirements at the time of project
appraisal. The increasing demand for petrol?um products coupled with the high
international crude oil prices was imposing a heavy burden on India's 'oreign
exchange position and on its ability to fund internal development. Thus, it
was a matter of considerable urgency to accelerate the pace of exploration for
additional petroleum resources. From seismic surveys and preliminary
exploratory drilling at the time, the Krishna-Godavari basin appeared to be
the most prospective area with the best potential of becoming the next new
petroleum province in India.
2.2       The Krishna Godavari Petroleum Exploration Project covered an area
of some 17,000 km2 both onshore and offshore Southeast India in the State of
Andhra Pradesh. Prior to initiation of this project ONGC had drilled five
wells in the project area: one onshore deep high pressure well was lost to a
blowout, and four wells in the offshore outer continental shelf resulted in an
oil discovery with one well and the loss of the other three due to unstable
sea bottom conditions. Two onshore deep high pressure gas prospects were
being drilled at time of appraisal. The high cost and technical problems
associated with both the onshore high pressure gas and deep water drilling
offshore caused ONGC to request Bank assistance. Bank policy was to support
India's strategy of accelerating exploration of its petroleum prospects by
obtaining foreign oil company ir,vestments and by focussing and strengthening
the activities of the state-owned oil companies. Considering the sizeable
investment already made by ONGC and the encouraging results obtained, it could
not be expected that this area would be turned over to foreign oil companies.
The Bank agreed to participate in the project because of the potential for
finding significant petroleum reserves and because of the assistance it could
offer ONGC in dealing with the adverse geological and environmental conditions
encountered in the area. The project area was restricted to that part of the
onshore end and offshore areas (about half the basin area) where ONGC already
had made considerable investments. Nearby areas were subsequently included in
exploration acreage offered to the foreign oil companies.

2.3       The Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) was the loan beneficiary
and implementing agency for the project. The Commission is a government-owned
statutory body created in 1959 by an act of Parliament to plan, promote and
implement the development of petroleum resources and the production and sales
of the products it produces. Over time ONGC has evolved into a full-fledged
oil company with in-house capabilities which are kept current through a policy
of keeping abreast of technological developments in the international oil
industry. Operational staff are divided among four regior.al offices (Central,
Western, Southern and Eastern) for onshore operations and the Bombav Offshore
Project (BOP) group for offshore operations. The Southern Region and BOP were
initially responsible for implementation. Later the Southern Region in Madras
was ass gned full implementation responsibility, offshore and onshore.
3.   Project Obiectives and Description
3.1       The principal objectives of the project were (i) to focus and
accelerate ONGC's activities in those specific areas of the Krishna-Godavari
basin where past exploration has identified highly promising potential for
commercially exploitable oil and gas reserves; (ii) to assist ONGC in verify-
ing this potential throu   further seismic surveys and exploratory drilling;
and (iii) to enhance ONGC's exploration capabilities under the very difficult
geological and environmental conditions in the Krishna-Godavari project area.
The project would constitute about a quarter of ONGC's exploration activities
during the project period. During appraisal, the project atea was carefully
delineated, and limited to less than half of the Krishna-Godavari offshore
basin, comprising the areas where ONGC has already made substantial explora-
tion investments which have resulted in discoveries, and which ONGC could
explore further and develop efficiently in the future with available resources
and technology.
3.2       The project consisted of the 1982/83-1985/86 time slice of ONGC's
exploration prouram ill the project area. Its components were:
(a) Onshore
(i)   about 1,700 line-km of seismic surveys, of which about 1,000
line-km would be high-resolution seismic lines centered on tl.e
most prospective delta and marsh areas around the mouth of the
Godavari River;
(ii)   drilling of 12 exploratory wells, of which 5 would be in deep
high-pressure gas prospects; and
(b) Offshore
(i)   about 3,500 line-km of special shallow water seismic surveys
and up to 4,000 line-km of infill seismic surveys in the
remaining offshore area of the project;
(ii)   drilling of 16 exploratory wells, of which 5 would be on the
outer shelf; and
(c) Technical Assistance. External support to ONGC for the supervision
of drilling, testing and completing of wells in the onshore high
pressure gas areas and in the outer shelf areas; and, as required,



3
for the improvement of quality control of geophysical data acquisi-
tion, processing and integration.
4.   Proiect Design and Organization
4.1       The project was innovative from both a Bank and Borrower perspective
in that it was one of the first and to date the largest Bank project wholly
devoted to petroleum exploration. There was an initial concern that the Bank
loan might tend to keep out the entry of international oil companies
interested in exploring for petroleum prospects in India.  However, this was
not the case. India made petroleum exploration and devalopment licenses
available to the international industry on three occasions during the course
of the proiect with the encouragement and unofficial assistance of the Bank.
The Bank clearly recognized the investment required in petroleum exploration
in India was of such a magnitude which could accommodate foreign investment.
multi-lateral, bi-lateral, and indigenous funds alike. The first public
offering to the international industry occurred in 1982 when both onshore and
offshore areas were offered. One license was awarded in the first offering,
but it was subsequently relinquished following seismic surveys and three dry
exploratory tests. The second offering in 1984 included only selective
offshore areas and no contracts were consummated. The third offering took
place in 1986 when a larger part of the offshore area, excluding the
established Bombay productive area but including substanti&! portions of the
Krishna-Godavari area, was included. Seven licenses were awarded in this
round, four of which were within or adjacent to the Krislna-Godavari Project
Area. To date seismic surveys plus two exploratory holes and one --ploratory
well currently drilling have resulted from the 1986 license round. One cf the
dry holes was drilled on a block adjacent to the Krishna-Godavari project
area. However, the two licenses awarded within this area are yet to be
drilled and will benefit from prior ONGC exploration activities including
those financed by the Bank. A fourth round of bidding has been pending; it -s
currently postponed to end-1990 to give the inew government time to review
India's petroleum programs including results of the third round.
4.2       The project was designed to be highly flexible particularly with
regard to well locations since most of the potential drilling sites were not
identified at appraisal and most were dependent on results of seismic surveys
to be conducted as part of the project. This concept of flexibility in
components was shared by the Bank and ONGC alike.
4.3       The number of wells and geophysical work included in the project
were not sufficient for a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of the project
area's prospects. This is tnderstandable considering the uncertainties
associated with exploration and the tendency to be conservative and not over-
invest if initial expectations turn out to be too optirristic. Fortuitously,
however, the sharp drop in the price of oil field services and goods during
the early part of the project made it possible for the Bank to support an
additional 22, mostly appraisal, wells. Thus, the exploratory drilling could
be more effectively and accurately evaluated. It also can be seen in
retrospect that the geophysical content of the project made a major
contribution to the successful results.

5.   Project Implederitation
5.1       As is evident from the disbursement profile (Annex  .), project
implementation took three years longer than planned. At least half of this
completion delay can be attributed to the extra wells and seismic work added
to the scope of the project to enable the original project objectives to be
achieved. Excessive procurement difficulties and time needed to resolve the
eligibility for Bank financing of drilling operations were the other major
delaying factors. A serious implementation shortcoming was due to poor
coordinatiou between the avaiiability of saismic results and drilling
equipment. To keep drilling equipment engaged it was often necessary to start
drilli.ig in locations not fully covered by the latest seismic data. It can be
seen in retrosDact that the Bank should have insisted on a longer
implementation period with more emphasis on planning. It would also have been
helpful if the project could have provided a braking mechanism to slow down
ONGC's "rig driven" drilling program. The 50 wells drilled under the project
adequately defined the hydrocarbon potential of the project area. Additional
activities preferably should have awaited the assimilation and evaluation of
the results of this drilling. The thirty odd wells drilled by ONGC in the
project area in parallel with the project budget did not materially affect
project results. This tencency to overdr.ill is common oii exploration
projecus. It can be avoided by strict adherence to a priority system of
selective drilling and the timely availability of s-ismic results. In the
absence of adequate seismic support, a decision must be made between the
possible cost of driiling a dry hole versus the drilling equipment standby
cost while waiting for the seismic results.l/
5.2       It was recognized that implementation of the drilling program faced
serious technical risks due to difficult operating conditions and a complex
geological environment. These risks were mitigated through careful prepara-
tion and limitation of deep water drilling and through the employment of
consultants to advise on drilling and testing deep, high-pressure formation
and to assist in supervising outer shelf operations. These measures have been
successful. Although there were three blowouts (two on wells solely financed
by ONGC), there have been no serious personnel inJuries nor advecse effects on
the physical environment.
5.3       'wo important decisions were made during implementation:  (i) to add
to the original number of wells (particularly appraisal wells) when funds
become available, thus making .t possible to reach the project's exploration
objective; and (ii) to decline to add costly deep water "outer continenital
shelf" wells in the expanded drilling program, recognizing that the initial
results from appraisal drilling did not indicate sufficient reserves for
economic development in this costly environment.
6.   Proiect Results
6.1       Except for the three-year completion delay, the project can be
considered an overall success. It was completed at a cost only about 10%
higher than the amount budgeted for the original reduced project scope, and it
accomplished its principal objectives to (i) explore the project areas to a
1/   ONGC does not agree with this view which represents the considered
opinion of Bank St ff. (See Part II, page 8).



5
sufficient level to evaluate its hydrocarbon potential and provide focus for
follow-up exploration as and if required; (ii) appraise discoveries to a
degree which permits evaluation of their economic value; and (iii) enhance
ONGC's operational capabilities in seismic acquisitioii and processing and the
drilling and testing of wells under severe reservoir and surface conditions.
6.2       Hydrocarhons were found in ninr  distinct geological conditions i:.
cazbonate, volcanic and sandstone reservoirs in a variety of structural and
stratigraphic traps ranging from lower Cretoceous to Pliocene in geologic age.
Annex 2 tabulates the results from the 50 wells (25 exploration wells and 25
appraisal wells) drilled with Bank financing. The pertinent results are
summarized below:
(a)  The 25 e Dloration wells resulted in 8 discoveries (2 oil and 6 gas)
and the 25 appraisal wells resulted in 17 producers (9 gas and 8
oil). The respective 32% and 68% success ratio are acceptable and
exceed industry worldwide experience.
(h) Five of the discoveries were determined to be commercially
exploitable, containing an estimated 105 million Bbi¢ of recoverable
oil and 1,170 billion cu. ft. of recoverable gas. based on an
estimated US$700 million exploration and appraisal cost the
commercial finding cost is about US$2.50 per equivalent batrel of
oil. By industry standards this is an acceptable finding cost; it
is slightly above the current average in frontier areas and
significantly below the purchase price of in-ground reserves in
developed areas.
(c)  The internal economic rate of rLturn (IERR) from the project is 10%
based on yearend 1989 recoverable reserve estimates and production
forcasts.
6.3       The 10% rate of return is somewhat disapnointing, but it can be
explained by two major adversities. First of all, the rate of return
calculation is based on an esnd-1939 international crude oil price of US$18 per
Bbl compared to US$30 per Bbl in 1982 when the project was appraised.            II,
addition, the lower than expected rate of return reflects the lengthy and
sizeable front-end exploration investments with respect to the reserves proven
to be commercial so far. A more selective exploration approach and a more
concentrated effort to expedite developmert and marketing could have improved
the rate of return. For example three years elapsed between the first
indication of the discovery (through a well blowout) of Ravva, the most
important field, and the follow-up confirmation well.
6.4       Nevertheless prospects are good that the IERR will improve over time
with increased utilization of existing exploration and infrastructure
investments in combination with results of ongoing appraisal and developmen:
in the project area which have increased estimated recoverable reserves by 30%
and production forecasts by 20-25% since the IERR was calculated.
7.   Project Sustainability
7.1       Tne Krishna-Godavari exploration aid appraisal effort supported by
the project and also by ONGC with its own funding have verified a new oil and
gas province. Although reservoir behavior cannot be predicted with certainty,



6
prospects are good that the production of these new petroleum resources will
be profitable and sustainable. The .,ountry will benefit from the resulting
foreign exchange savings and ONGC should make a satisfactory return on its
forward development investments. To maximize these benefits, it is important
for ONGC to temporaril.y reduce its explorat-ion and appraisal investments until
the results of the project are assimilated and evaluated. A prudent and cost
effective plan should be adopted for the continued exploration and development
of the Krishna-Godavari basin.
8.   Bank Performance
8.1       The Bank helped in the successful outcome of the project, mainly in
early recognition of problems stemming from changes affecting the initial
appraisal. Timely reaction to and flexible solution of these problems along
with diligent efforts to provide advice and assistance during implementation
were significant contributions. However, on occasion, this assistance was
perhaps too forceful since it appeared to create some negative reaction on the
part of ONGC and at least partially reduced its desired impact.
8.2       Except for an overly conservative estimate of the number of wells
required, the Bank's contribution to the project's design was constructive and
in India's best interest. The Bank's basic aim to evaluate the project area's
petroleum potential at minimum cost was only partly realized because ONGC
conducted parallel drilling in the area before the project results could be
thoroughly evaluatec.
9.   Borrower's Performance
9.1       The Borrower's impiamenting agency, ONGC. committed substantial and
sufficient human and financial resources to the project and made diligent
efforts toward its success. During project implementation there were frequent
changes in ONGC managemen
t and other key personnel which reduced the impact of Bank mission suggestions
and advice. However, as the result of this advice, and building on its own
experience, ONGC improved its performance steadily throughout project
implementation. ONGC is now capable of both exploring and developing a basin
of the Krishna-Godavari type, i.e. deltaic deposition with its typically
unique style of structure.
10. Project Relationship
1i.1      In spite of some differences in approach to the project, the Bank-
ONGC relationship was quite good, due largely to the goodwill of both parties.
Each benefitted from the association.
10.2      The Government, including both the Ministry of Petroleum and the
Department of External Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, did not become
involved in what were largely regarded as technical project issues, and were
content to intervene only to expedite the disbursement of the loan. The
Government may have missed cn opportunity to gain better understanding of the
important upstream petroleum sector since the capital and operating expendi-
tures of ONGC are significant in the overall economv of the nation. Achieving
greater efficiencies in ONGC operations are important and warrant the atten-
tion of the Government.

11. Consultancy Services
11.1      Conitractors, suppliers, and to a much lesser degree consultants
performance played a large role in the successful outcome of the project.
However, since their work was primarily under ONGC supervision, it is
difficult to ascribe particular positive or negative impacts. In general, the
relationship of ONGC and its contractors appeared to be good.
12. Project Documentation and Data
12.1      Both the Staff Appraisal Report and the Loan and Project Agreements
provided a gvod framework for the project. In particular, they provided the
flexibility to make changes in project scope without undue procedural
problems.
12.2      ONGC provided the Bank with data from its exploration activities.
However, due to the sensitivity of the data much that was relevant could not
be provided under normal modes of transportation. Thus, at times frequent
supervision missions were required to keep abreast of operations and to assist
in decision making.
12.3      Most of the data required for this PCR was readily available in the
Bank, both in MIS and project files. However, a short PCR mission was
necessary for finalization of this report.

PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM ONGC'S PERSPECTIVE
BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT
Confirmation of Statistical Data of Part III of PCR
Technical data incorporated in respect of seismic and drilling operations
are correct.
COMMENTS ON PART-II ANALYSIS OF PCR
In retrospect, it can be surmised that the objective spelt out have been
fulfilled to a lintited extent. It is a fact that the quantum of seismic work
and drilling activity envisaged were not sufficient enough to evaluate the
significant exploratory leads obtained during the initial phases of
exploration, even the extended phase of activity did not cover one of the
important spheres viz. deep water exploration, for which even now ambitious
plan exists with ONGC.
Reference has also been made of ONGC's "Rig Driven" drilling programme
(para 5.1 of page 4). This is not correct. ONGC has followed the standard
procedure of seismic coverage, following it up with drilling wherever
necessary. Hcwever, in areas with significant exploration leads, the
geological data obtained from wells by itself provides enough incentive to
spread out the activity even against a scanty seismic coverage. Execution of
the project has established significant exploration leads in Tatipaka,
Pasaralapudi, Chintalapalli and Mandapeta areas on east Godavari basin, as
also in Kaza-Kaikalur areas in west Godavari basin.
Under project implementation in para 5.1 of page 4. the report says "at
least half of this completion delay can be attributed to the extra wells and
seismic work added to the scope of the project to enable original work
programme objectives to be achieved. The above can be read as follows:" At
least half of this completion delay can be attributed to non-anticipation at
appraisal stage of the sharp drop in the costs of all oil field related
activities precipitated by the reduction of petroleum exploration and
development following the unforeseen collapse of international crude oil
prices resulting in a large cost underrun (page 12 comment of World Bank in
Part III of PCR) which necessitated to take two important decisions: (para 53
of page 4 of Part III of PCR) firstly, to add to the original number of wells,
22 additional wells (mostly appraisal wells) (para. 4.3 of page 4), secondly,
to decline to add costly deep water "outer continental shelf" wells in the
expanded drilling programme as envisaged in the original programme at
appraisal report.

BANK'S PERFORMANCE
Close monitoring and inter-action at different phases of execution of the
project, towards evaluation of geoscientific data obtained through drilling
and prioritization of locations, contributed effectively in achieving high
success ratios in exploration.
BORROWER'S OWN PERFORMANCE
Presence of oil and gas in both offshsore and onland areas of KG basin in
commercial quantities was already known before the Bank agreed to provide loan
for executing the project. Dicoveries in G-1, G-2 Razole and Napsapur areas
which are significant even today were made before the Bank stepped in. The
area of exploration for the ONGC covered the entire KG basin whereas the Bank
agreed to support the programmes only in parts of the area which appeared most
promising. Such selective exploration gave an impression that their success
ratio was very high. The Bank did not even support drilling of a parametric
well like Kommagudem-I because it fell outside the area of World Bank
supported project. Although the Bank did not support all the exploratory
wells drilled in the basin, they insisted on examination of the derived data
by their experts even outside the World Bank supported area because they
happened to be located in the KG basin.
ONGC has been following an independent policy of exploration despite the
fact that the Bank has agreed to support part of the programme. Our
priorities were mainly dependent upon our commitments for supply of gas.
Preparation of feasibility reports necessitated sufficient reserves base build
i.:p for the offshore areas. The Bank mission who visited Madras from time to
time were not fully appreciative of our priorities and therefore did not
approve of our plans to drill wells like Mandapetta-2. We have realized that
the extent of the gas bearing area in Mandapetta was similar than envisaged
earlier. If we had followed the advice of World Bank missio.. and drilled
down-deep wells in the block of Mandapetta-I, we should have been in the dark
for a long time about the limitation of the results. Therefore, even negative
results have a value and helped us for planning our own production strat.gies
in a better way. However, this is not meant to belittle the valuable
contributions made by the Bank's mission during the course of irnplementation
of the project. On the basis of the seismic and drilling data, ONGC had
firmed up locations on lucrative prospects following a national strategy of
exploration whereas World Bank mission had selected from amongst these with a
limited objective of proving immediate success.
The borrower (ONGC) should hav.* a firm drillirg plan in terms of
deploying owned vs. hired rigs. This will enable to estimate the project cost
more accurately in terms of charter hire rates, material cost, etc. which will
in turn help to have control over actuals as against estimate.
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BANK AND THE BORROWER
The relationship between the Bank and the ONGC during the implementation
of the project was certainly quite effective since we had frequent exchange of
ideas during the visit of Bank's mission and therefore we could review and
reprioritize the items of work as and when necessary. With these mid-courses
corrections, the implementation of the project was carried out with the best
possible results. We had a very free and frank exchange of ideas, concepts



10
and strategi,s to be followed and in most of the cases, ye have followed the
best course available to uu. It was because of this that it vas possible to
include additional seismic surveys and number of additional wells in the
programms to fully utilize the loan even though the project implementation
over-shot the initially estimated time limit.
PERFORMANCE OF CO-FINANCI5S
There is no co-financier to ONCC for the above loan.

4. Prolect Implementation
The following table compares the actual completion dates of the
major project components with the target dates set at appraisal. The
comparison is not very relevant because of the substantial increase in the
number of wells and the increased seismic work added to the project scope as a
result of the project cost underrun. Without the project scope increase the
project would have been completed during mid-1986, about 18 months behind
schedule. The increase in the number of wells (from 28 to 50) and an
equivalent increase in the seismic program added about 18 months to the
completion date. As discussed in Part I of this report the major other causes
of the project delay were prolonged procurement difficulties and the time
required to resolve which particular drilling operations were eligible for
Bank financing.

Comment:  The 10% increase in the final project cost was caused by the increased cost of
the expanded project scope approved by the Bank.  Without the increase in the well
drilling program (from 28 to 50 wells) and a corresponding increase in seismic work, the
project would have experienced a large cost underrun. The Bank did not anticipate at
appraisal the sharp drop in the cost of all oil field related activities precipitated by
the reduction of petroleum exploration and development following the unforeseen collapse

B. Drilling Results
6.2       The results of the 50 Bank financed wells are Tabulated in Annex 2,
and the 39 wells, which ONGC financed from its own resources, are tabulated in
Annex 3.
C. Direct Benefits
6.3       The direct benefits which India can expect to realize from the
project will depend on the production of the recoverable petroleum reserves
which have been discovered. The crude oil thus produced will displace an
equivalent quantity which otherwise would have to be imported since India is
not self-sufficient in this energy source. Annex 4 tabulates the estimated
commercial oil and gas reserves attributable to the project. The prospective
benefits are is follows:
(a) The estimated crude oil recovery is 13.8 million tons or 104.9
million barrels which at US$18 per BBL (Based on the US$16.5 current
fob price of Saudi Arabian light) would have an import substitution
value of US$1,890 million.
(b) The estimated 33.1 billion cubic meter (1,170 billion cu. ft.) of
recoverable gas is equivalent to 198 millior, barrels of oil which,
to the extent that it could displace imported liquid hydrocarbons,
would have a value of US$3,564 million.
D. Economic Impact
6.4       The estimated internal ec(-lomic rate of return (IERR) is 10%.  For
calculation see Annex 5. There was no appraisal evaluation of the project's
IERR.
6.5       The underlying assurnptions in calculating the IERR were:
(a) Future investment and production are based on current plans;
(b) Oil price forecast: Bank basket forecast of 01/22/90 discounted for
transportation and depletion premium based on US$2.5/bbl finding
cost;
(c) Gas price forecast: Proportional to Bank basket forecast reduced by
20% fuel oil equivalent) to calorific gas equivalent price dis-
counted for transportation and depletion premium based on US$0.3/Mcf
finding cost;
(d) Current costs were converted to constant dollars using 6% deflator
(inflator) throughout; and
(e) Local cost components were shadow priced for foreign exchange
scarcity at 80%.

B. Drilling Results
6.2       The results of the 50 Bank financed wells are Tabulated in Annex 2,
and the 39 wells, which ONGC financed from its own resources, are tabulated in
Annex 3.
C. Direct Benefits
6.3       The direct benefits which India can expect to realize from the
project will depend on the production of the recoverable petroleum reserves
which have been discovered. The crude oil thus produced will displace an
equivalent quantity which otherwise would have to be imported since India is
not self-sufficient in this energy source. Annex 4 tabulates the estimated
commercial oil and gas reserves attributable to the project. The prospective
benefits are as follows:
(a) The estimated crude oil recovery is 13.8 million tons or 104.9
million barrels which at US$18 per BBL (Based on the US$16.5 current
fob price of Saudi Arabian light) would have an import substitution
value of US$1,890 million.
(b) The estimated 33.1 billion cubic meter (1,170 billion cu. ft.) of
recoverable gas is equivalent to 198 million barrels of oil which,
to the extent that it could displace imported liquid hydrocarbons,
would have a value of US$3,564 million.
D. Economic Impact
6.4       The estimated internal economic rate of return (IERR) is 10%.  For
calculation see Annex 5. There was no appraisal evaluation of the project's
IERR.
6.5       The underlying assumptions in calculating the IERR were:
(a) Future investment and production are based on current plans;
(b) Oil price forecast: Bank basket forecast of 01/22/90 discounted for
transportation and depletion premium based on US$2.5/bbl finding
cost;
(c) Gas price forecast: Proportional to Bank basket forecast reduced by
20% fuel oil equivalent) to calorific gas equivalent price dis-
counted for transportation and depletion premium based on US$0.3/Mcf
finding cost;
(d) Current costs were converted to constant dollars using 6% deflator
(inflator) throughout; and
(e) Local cost components were shadow priced for foreign exchange
scarcity at 80%.
