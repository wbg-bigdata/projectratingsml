I. THE ENERGY SECTOR
Background
1.01     Commercial primary energy (coal, oil, gas, h Yro and nuclear)
accounts for about 46% of total primary energy supply- in India, with the
balance (54%) coming from noncommercial energy (mainly firewood, agricultural
and animal wastes). Coal, hydro and nuclear power have important roles in
meeting commercial primary energy requirements and in 1981/82 accounted for
approximately 67% of total supply; the share of petroleum is relatively
moderate in comparison with other developing countries and accounts for about
33% of total commercial primary energy supply. The supply of commercial
energy has been growing faster (about 5.3% per year), than that of
noncommercial energy (between 1.7% and 2.5% per year), thus resulting in a
steady decline in the share of noncommercial energy in total energy supply.
1.02     India has consistently followed energy policies that limit the use of
petroleum to sectors where economic substitution by other energy resources,
particularly coal, is not possible. Despite the recent development of
offshore petroleum resources, the country remains dependent on imported oil to
meet part of its primary energy requirements, particularly the growing demand
in transport, fertilizers and petrochemicals, as well as in the modern
agriculture sector where substitution by electricity continues to be limited
by insufficient power generation and distribution. The impact of the increase
in world oil prices after 1973 on India's balance of payments is evident from
the following: while the volume of petroleum imports grew by 30%, from 16 to
21 million tons of oil equivalent (toe) between 1972/73 and 1981/82, the cost
of imports over the same period grew about 23 times from $269 million to US$6
billion, equivalent to about 70% of India's estimated merchandise export
earnings. Well identified domestic energy resources such as coal and
hydroelectricity are large enough to supply most of India's future commercial
energy requirements for industry and power generation. However, proven oil
and gas reserves are not sufficient to meet the demand for oil in sectors
where further substitution by other fuels is limited.
1.03     In 1981/82, out of a total oil supply of 36.8 million toe, 16.2
million (or 44%) came from local production while the remainder (20.6 million
toe) had to be imported. Current projections based on production from known
petroleum reservoirs indicate a potential petroleum deficit of up to 34
million toe by the end of the 1980s. The high cost of petroleum imports will
remain a serious constraint to economic development unless new reserves are
discovered in the near future to compensate for the depletion of existing
reserves as well as to meet anticipated growth in demand. India's potential
oil and gas resources are significant, but many of the prospective areas are
1/ Supply is defined as production plus imports less exports. When changes
in stock levels are not taken into account, then supply equals apparent
consumption.

largely unexplored. Therefore, the exploration for new, and development of
existing, petroleum reserves is one of India's most pressing priorities.
1.04     It is against this background that India is making a concerted effort
to accelerate hydrocarbon exploration and development by the national oil
companies (i.e. ONGC and OIL) and also by foreign oil companies which were
invited in late 1980 and again in August 1982 to submit bids for exploration
and production sharing on many blocks offshore and onshore. The success of
these efforts, together with an active public sector program in developing
natural gas resources over the next three to four years, will be a key factor
in determining whether indigenous hydrocarbon supplies can be increased
sufficiently above current forecasts to meet a major portion of the
anticipated growth in demand during the present decade.
Energy Supply and Consumption
1. 5     In 1975/76 (the last year for which overall figures are available),
prirmary energy supply in India was 182 million tons of oil equivalent. The
breakdown by primary energy source is shown in Annex 1.1 and is summarized as
follows:

a/ Coal, lignite and oil used for power generation are excluded from these
consumption trends; however, all electricity (i.e. primary and
conventional thermal) consumption is included but on a delivered basis to
consumers (i.e. gross generation less internal power plant uses, as well
as transmission and distribution losses). Furthermore, oil consumption
excludes non-fuel uses (i.e. petrochemical feedstocks).
b/ Provisional.

Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertilizers; and Department of Coal.
The household sector accounts for a relatively small share of commercial
energy consumption (7% of coal, 19% of petroleum and 10% of electricity).
However, consumption of noncommercial energy in this sector is high,
particularly in the rural areas where electricity and kerosene are mostly used
for lighting. Although the substitution of commercial energy for non-
commercial energy will continue, noncommercial energy will remain a
significant source of supply for rural households. Measures are however
needed to maintain and even increase production from noncommercial sources
(particularly firewood) as well as improve the efficiency of cooking stoves in
order to conserve commercial energy for applications where non-commercial
energy is not possible or practicable.
1.07     Energy needs in agriculture are mainly for land preparation, water
lifting, threshing and transportation. They are met mostly by animal power or

by the use of liquid fuels (mainly diesel oil) and electricity. Commercial
energy consumption in agriculture accounts for only about 6.3% of commercial
energy use but has been growing rapidly between 1960/61 and 1980/81 (about
7.8% p.a. for oil products and 16.2% p.a. for electricity), reflecting the
efforts made to modernize the sector. This trend towards increased use of
commercial energy in agriculture will continue with the efforts to further
modernize the sector and increase the standard of living of the rural
population.
1.08     The industrial sector is by far the largest user of coal and
electricity. In 1980/81, it accounted for 75% of coal consumption (excluding
power generation), about 63% of electricity consumption and 19% of oil
consumption. In contrast to other developing countries the share of indus'ry
in total oil consumption is still relatively modest but has gradually
increased (it was only 11% in 1970/71). Over the past twenty years the energy
intensity of the industrial sector has increased from 0.12 to 0.17 tons of oil
equivalent per thousand rupees of gross domestic product originating from
industry (at factor costs in 1980/81 rupees) due primarily to the increased
use of electricity. In the future, the growth in the energy intensity of
industry is expected to slow down as a result of better capacity utilization
and use of appropriate technologies. The future industrial demand for energy
is difficult to predict since the sector has been affected by recurrent
shortages of power and raw materials as well as transport bottlenecks, so that
recent trends may not be representative. In addition, part of the industrial
capacity was built when energy was relatively cheap, and less attention was
paid to energy efficiency. It is believed that there is considerable
potential for energy savings in the industrial sector by improving the
efficiency of existing plant and equipment, improving the design of future
plants, and introducing energy efficiency standards, but this will require a
large investment effort.
1.09     The transport sector 11 is the largest user of petroleum products and
the second largest user of coal. Over the past twenty years the structure of
demand has changed considerably as a result of the rapid growth of road
transport and the substitution of diesel-electric for steam locomotives. In
1980/81 oil products accounted for 66% of the commercial energy consumed in
the sector compared to 47% in 1970/71 while the share of electricity remained
small at about 3% in 1980/81. Current projections in the transport sector
indicate continuing decline in coal consumption as road transport increases in
importance and as railways continue to shift to more efficent diesel electric
locomotives, thereby contributing to a growing demand for petroleum
products. The transport sector is an area where significant energy savings,
especially in petroleum products, could be achieved over time if measures were
taken to increase the capacity of the railways and to electrify main lines,
improve their operating efficiency, encourage the use of railways for long- -
distance freight and passenger hauls, improve the efficiency of road vehicles
(mainly trucks), and optimize the location of industrial plants. The
1/ The railways, power and coal subsectors are the critical infrastructure
bottlenecks in India and are reviewed in Economic Situation and Prospects in
India, April 1982 (Report No. 3872-IN).



performance of the railways improved substantially during 1981/82 as a result
of several innovations introduced in 1980/81. The Sixth Plan provides for
many investments for the railways that are expected to ease some of the
equipment problems in the medium term although the Plan allocation for this
sector appears to be inadequate to make up for the under-investment during the
two previous plan periods.
1.10     In 1980/81 the power sector used about 38 million tons of coal (about
33% of coal production). Of the power generated (including self-generation by
industry), about 42% came from hydroelectric and nuclear plants, 46% from coal
and 12% from oil. Over the past ten years the share of coal in conventional
thermal generation by utilities has fluctuated between 85% and 90% and this is
expected to continue in the future. The share of hydro and nuclear energy has
varied between 40% and 50% of total power generation. It is expected that by
1987/88 the consumption of oil in the power utilities will be limited to what
is required to ensure the efficient operation of coal-fired plants. Total
electricity consumption has been growing at an average of 6.5% p.a. between
1970/71 and 1980/81, a rate significantly lower than previously. However, as
the power shortages which developed during the 1970s demonstrated, the growth
of demand for electricity has been and will continue to be supply-constrained.
Energy Resources
1.11     Coal l/ is the main domestic source of commercial primary energy in
India with reserves (in seams greater than 1.2 meters thick and at depths less
than 600 meters) estimated at about 85 billion tons, of which about 25 billion
tons are proven reserves. Most of the coal is of low to medium quality (3,500
to 5,500 kcal/kg). The 1981/82 coal production is estimated at 124.7 million
tons, making India the sixth largest coal producer in the world, with an
output three times that of any other developing country. Between 1975/76 and
1979/80, coal production stagnated at about 100 million tons per year because
of extensive flooding in 1978, serious power shortages, delays in
commissioning new mines, lack of explosives, labor unrest, and transportation
bottlenecks. During both 1980/81 and 1981/82, coal production increased by 10
million tons per year, a remarkable achievement, although, at present, coal
production is still about 10 million tons per year less than demand. Most of
the production and transport problems are being addressed. For example, the
Sixth Plan embodies further measures to overcome the infrastructure-related
constraints, and labor relations have improved in the past year. The Plan
also includes significant investments to bring new mines into operation. In
order to increase productivity, a high proportion of these new investments
will be in open-pit mining. Since in the past most of the delays in bringing
new mines into operation were experienced in underground projects, the shift
to open-pit mining is expected to help in reducing delays in project execution
and commissioning. About two-thirds of the planned increase in production (40
to 45 million tpy) between 1980/81 and 1984/85 is to come from open pit
mines. However, about 47% of this increase is to come from projects still to
be approved. Various demand projections for coal by 1984/85 range between 165

to 185 million tons while production is expected to range between 155 and 165
million tons. Of the expected 1984/85 coal demand, power generation would
account for about 42%, steel would utilize about 23%, the railways 6% and
cement about 4% of the total. In order to achieve the production targets, the
coal industry has to overcome the problems referred to above, and will need to
avoid delays in project preparation and implementation. Improvements in the
ability of local equipment manufacturers to provide new equipment and spare
parts in a timely manner will also be needed.
1.12     India's hydroelectric potential is estimated at about 400,000 GWh of
annual energy generation which might sustain an installed hydro power capacity
of 100,000 MW at a 45% load factor. But almost 70% of this potential is in
remote areas in the north and northeast and difficult to access. About 12,600
MW (13% of potential) is already developed and represents 36% of the total
installed generating capacity of approximately 35,000 MW (including 2,736 MW
of non-utility capacity). An additional 4,700 MW of hydro power capacity is
scheduled for commissioning by 1984/85, and a further 23,000 MW is under study
for development. India also has sufficient reserves of uranium (34,000 tons
equivalent of U308, of which 15,000 tons is considered economically
exploitable at current international prices) and thorium to meet the
foreseeable requirements of its nuclear power program. The existing nuclear
power plants have a capacity of 860 MW. In addition, four units with a
combined capacity of 940 MW are under construction.
1.13     Demand for power has consistently exceeded supply in the last
decade.  The gap has widened in recent years and the shortage in 1980/81 is
estimated to have reached about 13%. The basic reasons for the gap between
demand and supply are the strong growth in demand, delays in completing
planned thermal generation capacity and low capacity utilization. Capacity
utilization of thermal power plants declined from about 55% in 1976/77 to 45%
in 1980/81 but increased to 47% in 1981/82. The low capacity utilization is
partly due to difficulties in plant commissioning, delayed maintenance of
boilers and turbogenerators, lack of spare parts, shortages of appropriately
trained manpower, problems relating to design and fabrication of domestically
produced equipment and continuing difficulties in the supply and quality of
coal. A high-level commission has recently carried out a comprehensive
analysis of the situation and has submitted its findings to the Government.
Several measures are being introduced to improve the efficiency of thermal
plants, including: (a) improved preventive and planned maintenance; (b) better
availability of spare parts; (c) improved training; (d) adequate coal supplies
of acceptable quality; and (e) more effective management. The results of
these measures are already having an impact in the sector. In 1980/81 and
1981/82, power generation increased by 9% and 10% respectively. With the
implementation of the above measures more progress is projected for the medium
term. Power generation capacity is planned to reach 50,900 MW by 1984/85,
(including about 2,750 MW of non-utility capacity). The increase will come
from thermal power plants (70%), hydroelectric units (25%) and nuclear plants
(5%). The country-s overall average electrical energy requirements are
expected to be met by 1988/89 onwards, although a peak capacity deficit would
most likely continue until the mid-1990s and regional capacity differences
will continue to impose shortages in some areas.
1.14     India-s remaining proven and probable recoverable reserves of
petroleum are currently estimated at 800 million tons of oil equivalent, of



- 8 -
which 470 million tons is oil and the remainder natural gas. Domestic oil
production has increased from 0.5 million tons in 1961 to 16.2 million tons in
1981/82 and currently meets about 44% of India's domestic oil requirements.
Gas production is currently estimated at about 3.1 million tons of oil
equivalent, of which about 60% is used as fuel or feedstock, and the balance
is flared (mostly in Assam), mainly because there is no market within
reasonable distance. The petroleum sub-sector is discussed in more detail in
Chapter II.
1.15     Renewable energy represented 59% of total primary energy supply in
1975/76 but this share has been declining. Wood, charcoal, dung and vegetable
wastes made up an estimated 92% of the total with the remainder provided by
hydroelectric power. Renewable energy (especially traditional fuels) will
continue to play an important though decreasing role in rural energy supplies
as the agriculture sector is further modernized and the living standards of
the rural population improve with a corresponding increase in the use of
commercial energy.
Energy Prospects
1.16     Several studies of India's future energy demand and supply
alternatives have been carried out. The most comprehensive is the Report of
the Working Group on Energy Policy (WGEP), published in 1979, which
assesses: (i) whether the availability of energy may become a serious
constraint to India-s economic development; and (ii) what would be the likely
impact of an active energy conservation program on India-s future energy
balances. Although WGEP recognizes the limitations of such an exercise, given
that historical data may not be indicative of future developments, it
concludes that:
(i)  commercial energy availability may become a serious constraint
to economic development, either because domestic resources would
be insufficient to meet the anticipated demand or because the
effort required to develop domestic resources would imply human
and financial inputs which are not likely to be available;
(ii)  a coordinated and all-encompassing energy conservation/demand
management program would have a significant impact beyond the
late 1980s and could possibly reduce commercial energy demand'by
as much as 20% (the main reduction being in the demand for power
and in the demand for petroleum and petroleum products across
the entire economy, but especially in the transport sector); and
(iii)  the most critical aspect of India's future energy policy will be
to contain (within economic limits) the demand for oil at as low
a level as possible.
1.17     The policy measures it recommends are:  (i) improvement in the
efficiency of energy utilization; (ii) introduction of fuel-efficient
technologies; (iii) reduction of transportation demand through improved
planning of production and consumption locations; (iv) reduction of the energy
intensity of industries; and (v) inter-fuel substitution from commercial
energy to noncommercial and renewable energy. The Working Group considers



- 9 -
that such measures, supplemented by appropriate pricing policies, would permit
India to reduce commercial energy consumption without affecting economic
growth. It is hoped that the ratio of energy use to GDP would decline by 50%
between the late 1970s and the early 1990s. The energy saving measures
outlined above supported by detailed implementation plans and an appropriate
pricing policy, could substantially reduce waste and improve energy
availability in the future.
II. THE PETROLEUM SUBSECTOR
Introduction
2.01     Despite rapid development of its largest oil field (Bombay High),
India currently imports about 56% of its petroleum requirements. By 1984/85,
the year of expected peak production from Bombay High, imports will still
account for about 33% of domestic supply as production reaches 30 million tons
compared with anticipated consumption of 45 million tons.
2.02     Much of India's potential petroleum-bearing areas are still
relatively unexplored and production is concentrated only in a few regions.
Historically, the pace and scope of exploration activity has been uneven and
scarce resources have had to be concentrated on a few promising areas. Since
the discovery and development of the giant Bombay High Field off the West
Coast of India in the mid-1970s, India has not established any new major
commercial discovery. Ongoing exploration efforts of ONGC, however, have been
encouraging and have identified several petroleum-bearing areas which need
further exploratory drilling to determine their commercial potential. With
production from presently known oil reservoirs able to meet just under one-
half of the expected demand by the end of the decade, the Government of India
has recognized the urgency of accelerating the pace of petroleum exploration
and has adopted new policies to bring this about.
Petroleum Consumption, Production and Prices
a. Consumption and Production Trends
2.03     Crude oil consumption grew steadily from about 8.0 million tons in
1960/61, to 22.4 million tons in 1972/73. Following the first oil crisis in
1973, oil consumption was held between 23 and 24 million tons per year from
1973/74 through 1975/76. Consumption again started to gradually increase in
1976/77 reaching an estimated 32.3 million tons by 1981/82. While domestic
production accounted for only 6% of consumption in 1960/61, this proportion
had reached 36% in 1970/71 before falling to between 30% to 33% through
1974/75. As production from Bombay High started in 1976/77 and continued to
increase, domestic crude oil accounted for 36% to 41% of consumption during
1977/78 through 1979/80 and 44% in 1981/82.
2.04     The accelerated development (para 2.19) of the presently known
petroleum reservoirs is expected to increase domestic crude oil production
substantially, from about 16.2 million tons in 1981/82 to a projected 30



- 10 -
million tons in 1984/85. Thus, domestic oil can be expected to provide at
least 60% of total oil consumption by the mid-1980s (Annex 2.1) but less than
50% by the end of the decade. In addition, the development of the offshore
South Bassein gas field will provide the equivalent of about 0.6 million toe
of gas by 1984/85, rising to 6 million toe by 1989/90, making gas a
significant energy resource in the late 1980s. This is summarized below:

a/ Production forecasts are based on development of presently known petroleum reservoirs and do
not assume new discoveries from the accelerated exploration program.
b/ Domestic crude oil production in 1980/81 was adversely affected by political unrest in Assam
c/ Crude oil equivalent of petroleum products converted at 1.0638 tons of crude per ton of
products.
2.05      These forecasts are realistic provided the accelerated development
program of ONGC and OIL, as well as the transport and downstream facilities
for the use of the projected gas production, are implemented in a timely
manner. However, it is also clear that a substantial exploration program
should be maintained if domestic oil production in the late 1980s is to be
maintained or increased. Petroleum imports could reach about 33.7 million
tons in 1989/90, compared to 20.6 million tons actually imported (net) in
1981/82, unless additional petroleum discoveries are made.
2.06     Almost all natural gas produced in India at present is associated
gas. The quantities produced are relatively small, however, and about 40% is
flared, particularly in Assam where the fields are small and dispersed,
consumers are far away, making it uneconomic to utilize the small quantities



- 11 -
produced. The role of gas as an energy resource is therefore minor so far,
with consumption in 1981/82 at only about 2.3 billion Nm3 (1.9 million toe),
equivalent to 1% of commercial primary energy consumption and 5% of crude oil
consumption. With the development of the South Bassein gas field just about
to begin (1982/83-1984/85), and prospects for commercial quantities of either
free or associated gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin, the role of gas in the
commercial energy sector is expected to increase rapidly and become
significant in the late 1980s.
b. Pricing Policies
2.07     India, in recent years,  has consistently followed a policy of
maintaining composite retail prices of oil products at international levels,
with a cross-subsidy from gasoline towards kerosene (on social and
environmental grounds) and naphtha (for fertilizers). The price of a
reconstituted barrel of petroleum products is $46.721/ at the retail level
based on prices in effect since July 11, 1981. In spite of the cross-subsidy
from gasoline to kerosene, the latter's consumption growth has been relatively
slow at 2.5% per year during 1970/71-1980/81 compared to 5% per year for all
light distillates and 6.5% per year for all middle distillates. Most of the
growth in consumption has been for naphtha, diesel oil, LPG and fuel oil.
Prices are as follows for the main products:
Prices as of July 1981
Rs per Liter                   US$ per US Gallon

a/ Prices in New Delhi, about average for India.
Taxes and royalties on crude oil and its products constitute substantial
sources of revenues for the Government of India and State Governments. In
1979/80, GOI received through excise duties, customs duties, corporate income
taxes, dividends, cess and royalties on offshore oil altogether Rs 20 billion
(US$2.2 billion). In addition State Governments receive a royalty and a sales
tax on onshore oil, but overall proceeds are not known.
2.08     Natural gas, unlike crude oil, is sold directly by the producers (OIL

per barrel of each product by its proportion in consumption, using 1980/81
weights.



- 12 -
and ONGC) to the consumer, on the basis of long-term contracts (which require
government approval). Offshore gas is priced on the basis of the end-use;
onshore gas prices can vary considerably from one consumer to the next as they
are affected, for instance, by the year in which the contract was entered
into, local surpluses of gas being flared, etc. ONGC's gas prices are
discussed further in paras. 6.06 and 6.07. Domestic crude oil is sold to the
refineries at Government-regulated prices which were raised substantially in
July 1981. Although below international levels, the current domestic crude
oil prices (para 6.05) ensure a satisfactory financial performance for the
producers as well as allow them to finance from internally generated funds a
major portion of their investment programs. Finally, exploration and
development decisions are based on international oil prices, rather than the
relatively lower domestic price, and the latter price does not act as a
disincentive to invest in oil exploration or development. The average level
and structure of petroleum prices in India are considered satisfactory at
present.
Petroleum Resources, Past and Future Development
a. Petroleum Resources
2.09     Petroleum reservoirs are found in sedimentary basins.  In India,
there are 27 sedimentary basins with a total area of approximately 1.72
million km2 of which aboumillion         km2 (81%) is onshore with the
remainder, offshore (to a water depth of 200 meters). Commercial petroleum
production has been established in only two sedimentary basins. The first is
the Assam-Arakan basin in parts of Assam and extending to Nagaland, Meghalaya,
Tripura, Manipur and Mizoram in the eastern part of the country. The second
is the Cambay basin comprising an area in Gujarat and also including the
Bombay High offshore fields. However, indications of petroleum have been
found in six other basins: Konkan, Krishna-Godavari, Cauvery, Rajasthan,
Andaman Islands and the Tripura fold belt. The Ratnagari oil field in the
Konkan basin is being developed and is expected to start production in late
1982. The Krishna-Godavari and Cauvery basins are by far the most promising
new areas today with the Krishna-Godavari particularly standing out as the
next likely major discovery after Bombay High. Magnetic and gravimetric
surveys have been undertaken for most of the potential petroleum bearing
areas. However, the more critical modern geophysical surveys have covered
less than 50% of the prospective areas; and no exploratory drilling has been
carried out in more than 65% of the areas.
2.10     As of March 1981 cumulative oil production in India totalled 141.8
million tons of oil; and from 1970/71 to 1980/81 some 19.3 million toe of gas
were produced. The Government's estimate of remaining recoverable proven and

probable reservesi/ from existing fields is as follows:

2.11     The long-term view of the total geological petroleum resources (i.e.
initial oil or gas in-place), and the recoverable resources of a country are
based on prognostic studies, using geological extrapolations and
interpolations, as well as many technical and economic assumptions. The
results of such studies are highly speculative and subject to wide divergence
of opinion. Nonetheless, they provide a broad indication of potential
petroleum resources and a framework for developing long-term energy sector
policies and petroleum subsector exploration and development strategies. A
recent study has estimated the total potential Indian geological resources of
petroleum at about 15 billion tons of oil equivalent, of which about 30% is
considered recoverable. About two-thirds of the potential recoverable
petroleum resources are estimated to be located offshore, and about three-
quarters of the potential reserves are gas. While these estimates may be
considered very optimistic, they are indicative of the substantial
undiscovered potential.
b. The Role of the Private and Public Sectors in the Development of
India-s Petroleum Potential
2.12     Commercial quantities of petroleum were first discovered in India in
1889 at Digboi, Assam, by the Assam Oil Company, a private firm. In 1915 the
1/ The estimates of recoverable petroleum reserves from fields already
producing or just recently discovered are generally classified into: proven
reserves, probable reserves and possible reserves. Proven reserves have the
highest degree of certainty and are based only on areas delineated by actual
drilling and successful testing. Probable reserves are those inferred from
the full lateral extent of the reservoir structure, that is, beyond the limits
defined by existing wells. Possible reserves include the additional recovery
that could reasonably be expected from the known reservoirs if enhanced oil
recovery schemes are implemented.

Burmah Oil Company (UK) also began exploration in Assam and in 1921 acquired
full control of the Assam Oil Company. Until the 1950s, petroleum exploration
was concentrated in the northeastern part of the country, namely in Assam,
Tripura and Nagaland. In 1954, ONGC1/ began as a department of the Geological
Survey of India, and it was established in its present form by an Act of
Parliament in 1959. Oil India Limited (OIL) was established in 1959 following
an oil discovery in Assam by Burmah Oil Company (UK). The Government of India
initially took a one-third equity interest in OIL, then increased its equity
interest to 50% in 1961, and in October 1981, purchased the entire Indian
assets of the Burmah Oil Company, covering its interest in OIL and in the
Assam Oil Company. Starting in 1959, ONGC discovered petroleum reserves in
Cambay (1959), Ankleshwar (1960), Kalol (1961), and Sanand (1962), all in
Gujarat. Later, ONGC discovered oil in Lakwa (1964) and Galeki (1968) in
Assam.
2.13     Following the oil crisis of 1973, exploration activities accelerated
particularly offshore, resulting in the discovery by ONGC in 1974 of the giant
offshore field of Bombay High and a number of significant but smaller fields
in its vicinity. Assam was the major petroleum producing area (4.2 million
tpy) in the country until the early 1970s when production from Gujarat also
reached just over 4 million tpy. By 1979/80, production from Bombay High had
also exceeded 4 million tpy and by 1981/82 reached 8 million tpy.
2.14     International oil companies have been involved in petroleum
exploration in India intermittently. Prior to 1950, the Assam Oil Company and
the Burmah Oil Company were the only firms active in petroleum exploration.
In 1954, the Indo-Stanvac (Standard Oil and Socony Vacuum, now Exxon and
Mobil, U.S.A.) agreement with 2a 25% GOI interest, was signed, providing for an
exploration area of 10,000 km in West Bengal. The venture was abandoned in
1959, after drilling 10 (dry) wells. From 1974 to 1977, three joint-venture
agreements each covering 25,000 km2 of offshore area, were also concluded with
Asamera (Canada), Natomas (USA), and Reading and Bates (USA) but the companies
withdrew following completion of the minimum work requirements because the
results were discouraging. In the following years, the Government did not
encourage participation of foreign oil companies in petroleum exploration.
2.15     In late 1980, recognizing the urgent need to accelerate the pace of
exploration but aware of the technical and financial constraints on ONGC's own
exploration activities, the Government decided to actively promote open areas
for exploration by forei n firms. Thirty-two blocks, each ranging in size
from 10,000 to 30,000 km offshore and onshore, were offered to international
bidders.  The total area offered, almost 0.9 million km2, represented about
50% of the country s sedimentary basin area. Although 34 foreign oil
companies were invited, only seven submitted bids and offers were concentrated
on just two offshore blocks in the vicinity of oil producing areas. This
response was somewhat disappointing but can be partly explained by the
probable concern of some companies that India would want and would likely
exercise its option to buy back their oil share. Undoubtedly, the companies
have so far adopted a "wait and see" attitude and still view India's new
exploration strategy with caution after a substantial period in which private
1/ ONGC-s organization is reviewed in Chapter V.

industry involvement has been minimal. Thus, it is not surprising that the
initial round of bidding involving relatively unknown areas with what can be
regarded as modest geological potential, as well as untested government
policies, attracted only a few bids which concentrated on the most promising
blocks offered (i.e. contiguous to producing areas). One production-sharing
agreement2has so far been signed with a consortium led by Chevron (USA) for an
18,500 km block offshore Gujarat, north of the Bombay High field. The terms
of the production sharing agreement provide for Chevron to drill at least
three wells, spending a minimum of US$29 million over a three-year period, at
its own risk. Upon commercial discovery, ONGC may assume up to 50% joint
venture in future development (without payment of exploration costs) and
production will be split according to a scale which escalates with field
profitability. Until India achieves self-sufficiency in oil, GOI has the
option to purchase Chevron's share of the oil produced at international
prices. Chevron started its seismic survey after contract signing and it was
completed in July 1982; drilling is expected to start late 1982 after the
monsoon season. Meanwhile, invitations to bid on a second round of offerings
were issued end-August 1982 to 37 foreign oil companies. The second offering
includes 50 blocks both onshore and offshore, including new areas such as west
of the Bombay High field (in 200 m of water), and the outer-shelves of the
Krishna-Godavari and Mahanadi deltas. In view of that fact that: (i) ONGC
has recently made a discovery in one of the blocks previously offered (Palk
Straits) but not bid upon by companies; and (ii) the contractual framework has
enabled one major oil company to enter into an exploration contract, the
response to the offering in this second round is expected to be much better.
Therefore, one may conclude that a process has been initiated which, if
supported by further discoveries, will, over time, lead to a substantial
increase in private sector activities and an acceleration of exploration work
to levels commensurate with India's prospective acreage.
2.16      In the public sector two companies, ONGC and OIL, have traditionally
undertaken exploration activities. ONGC has had, and will continue to have,
by far the largest involvement in the petroleum sector as the principal entity
in charge of petroleum exploration and development. OIL is much smaller than
ONGC and produces about 3 million tpy of oil, all from Assam.  Until recently,
it had a licence covering only about 2,500 km2 in Assam and Arunchal
Pradesh. The company has explored its licensed area extensively and has
replenished its reserves through steady but small discoveries. Since late
1981, OIL obtained exploration rights in Orissa (the Mahanadi basin), both
onshore and offshore, and in areas in Rajasthan.
2.17     The Ministry of Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertilizers is in charge of
policy making in the petroleum sector. It monitors activities in the sector
closely and, inter alia, has to vet all the programs and budgets proposed by
public sector enterprises. The Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB), a
public body created in 1974, provides financing to public sector enterprises
in the petroleum production and refining sectors. Its only source of revenues
is a cess levied on domestic oil production. The attached map (IBRD Map No.
16185) describes the main features of India's petroleum subsector.
c. Development Prospects and Investment Strategy
2.18      The petroleum subsector program of the Government has four principal
components: to increase production from existing fields, primarily by
accelerating development programs by ONGC and OIL in areas where petroleum has



- 16 -
already been discovered; to accelerate exploration for yet undiscovered
resources both by the national and foreign oil companies; to modernize the
existing refineries and construct new ones; and to develop the gas pipeline
system and construct additional gas-using plants (e.g. fertilizer and
petrochemical plants) to use more effectively the significant gas reserves
currently untapped.
2.19     Following the successful implementation of the initial four phases of
development of the Bombay High field as well as the encouraging results of
recent exploration activities, GOI has authorized both ONGC and OIL to
accelerate their petroleum exploration and development programs. Thus, while
the current Plan (1980/81-1984/85) originally earmarked about Rs 33.3 billion
in 1980/81 prices for petroleum exploration and development, representing a
47% real increase above the actual expenditures during the previous five-year
period (1975/76-1979/80), ONGC and OIL have responded with a much higher
revised budget proposal of about Rs 53.8 billion in 1980/81 prices for
exploration and development, most of which has already been approved. The
focus of this revised program is the accelerated implementation of the fifth
and sixth phases of the development of Bombay High, the development of the
offshore South Bassein gas field and further exploratory drilling in the
Krishna-Godavari basin. As mentioned earlier, several other areas are
expected to be explored by foreign firms on a production-sharing basis during
the current Plan period.
2.20     The accelerated petroleum exploration and development program would
also mean larger investments in petroleum refining and d:^bu., 2;clities
as well as investments for downstream processing plants (e.g. fertilizer ind
petrochemical plants). In particular, the development of the South Bassein
gas field will require the rapid implementation of six new gas-based
fertilizer plants and related gas pipelines. A comparison of the actual
expenditures for the petroleum sector during 1975/76-1979/80 as well as the

The Bank-s Role and Lending Strategy in the Petroleum Subsector
2.21     Most of the Bank's lending operations to India in energy have been in
the power subsector (27 Bank/IDA operations for a total of US$3,059.0 million)
and spans a period of 32 years. However, the Bank-s involvement in the
petroleum subsector has grown substantially. Two loans have been made to ONGC
(US$550 million total) for the development of the Bombay High field, 1/, and a
US$200 million loan was made in April 1982 for the modernization of several
refineries2/.
2.22     The Bank-s role in the Indian petroleum sub-sector continues to
address several inter-related aspects with varying degrees of emphasis
depending on the specific projects. These aspects are; (i) providing policy
advice on hydrocarbon exploration, development, processing and utilization
strategy through Bank involvement in key projects; (ii) assisting the domestic
petroleum companies develop their technical expertise and capability in each
major phase of hydrocarbon exploration, development and processing; (iii)
contributing to improve the technical design and implementation arrangements
of major projects; and (iv) strengthening the profitability and financial
structure of project entities so that they can self-finance a substantial
portion of their investments and attract more commercial financing for such
investments.
2.23     The Bank has been associated with Bombay High development since the
early stages, and was instrumental in ensuring that all the required reservoir
and field development studies have been carried out in accordance with
industry practice before the huge development program was launched.
Subsequently GOI requested Bank financing for the Bombay High development.
The development of that field has proceeded largely according to plans, with
ONGC implementing more complex and larger phases, after reservoir studies and
actual production performance have confirmed the initial expectations. In
line with modern oil industry practices, ONGC has planned early for the
introduction of reservoir pressure maintenance through water injection, which
should constitute the bulk of the next development phase. Throughout the
development of Bombay High, ONGC has used experienced foreign consultants and
contractors, to optimize the oil recovery and the technical design, as well as
to supplement ONGC-s own capabilities. A Project Performance Audit Report for
the first Bombay High Project is currently being reviewed by GOI and will be
submitted to the Board during the last quarter of 1982.
2.24     ONGC's efforts in the Bombay High development were supported by the
Bank through the two loans mentioned earlier which included undertakings by
GOI regarding the formulation and adoption of oil and gas pricing policies
which would enable ONGC to earn satisfactory profits, thereby improving its
creditworthiness, and increasing its commercial borrowing capability to help
finance its large investment program. In this regard, the Bank encouraged GOI
1/ Loan No. 1473-IN approved in June 1977, and Loan No. 1925-IN approved in
December 1980.
2/ Loan No. 2123-IN approved in April 1982.



- 18 -
and ONGC to seek external commercial financing for the Bombay High
development. The first Eurodollar borrowing (US$50 million) was obtained in
1977 with highly favorable terms in connection with the first Bombay High
Project, which paved the way for subsequent larger recourse to private
external sources in support of the Bombay High program. From 1977/78 through
1981/82, ONGC obtained commitments for approximately US$409 million from
commercial sources, compared to nil prior to that period. Though most of
these borrowings cannot be categorized as cofinancing, they can be credited,
to some extent, to the Bank's advise and catalytic role in securing commercial
financing. More recently, GOI adopted a policy of using ONGC as a privileged
vehicle for commercial financing; under a new policy, all eligible items put
to competitive bidding are offered with a request for commercial financing
proposals (para. 3.18). Under this new policy, ONGC has obtained, so far
during 1982/83, about US$245 million of commercial loans/credits. Thus ONGC
is currently one of the largest Indian borrowers on the international capital
markets.
2.25     While ONGC has acquired considerable expertise in offshore
development during the past seven years, it still faces substantial technical
and financial challenges during the next decade in undertaking a large and
ambitious investment program on its own as well as in any joint-venture
development efforts that would hopefully materialize with international oil
companies. Technically, ONGC will need to concentrate its capabilities
primarily on those areas were discoveries have already been made.
Financially, ONGC will need to continue mobilizing large amounts of foreign
exchange. So far, ONGC has successfully borrowed increasingly larger amounts
to help to finance its investment requirements from foreign commercial
loans/credits, as discussed in paras 3.18 and 6.11; the Bank will continue to
encourage GOI and ONGC to increase recourse to foreign commercial borrowing.
2.26     During the 1980's, the complexity and scope of ONGC's operations will
continue to increase as more efforts will have to be devoted to exploration,
while the pressure for accelerated development of known fields is unlikely to
diminish. ONGC is about to embark on the first large-scale gas development
project in India involving the South Bassein offshore gas field. This project
presents new challenges concerning the project design and the development of a
market for natural gas, whose use at present is very small. Since 1980, the
Bank has been discussing with the Government the potential supply and
alternative uses for gas.
2.27     With regard to oil exploration, India's policy of having parallel
efforts by national and international oil companies is fully justified and is
well focused. During the preparation of the proposed Project, the Bank had
two primary objectives. The first is to support India's accelerated
exploration strategy. As part of this, the Bank is helping to implement the
"open door" policy which India has recently adopted and also to promote and
undertake exploration efforts. Through the Bank's involvement (since 1980) in
the conceptual design and preparation of the proposed Krishna-Godavari
Project, it has helped the Government undertake the initial steps towards a
larger and more immediate role for the private sector in petroleum
exploration. In the case of the previous international offering of
exploration acreage (para 2.15), the Government, after discussions with the
Bank, increased the average block size, and furthermore, added blocks to the
offering. Two of these blocks attracted all the bids received. The Bank also



- 19 -
provided advice to ONGC and GOI regarding    (i) approach to negotiations with
foreign oil companies; (ii) contractual matters (e.g., fiscal terms, minimum
work program, form of GOI/ONGC participation); and (iii) monitoring of the
foreign oil companies exploration and development activities after contracts
have been signed. More specifically, Bank staff provided information and
comments about standard international practices related to production-sharing
agreements and minimum work commitments which helped the Government formulate
contract terms in line with industry trends. The Bank intends to continue
providing such informal technical assistance in the future, as requested by
the Government.
2.28     The second Bank objective concerning exploration is to improve the
quality, in terms of both design and implementation arrangements, of large
exploration projects in the country through Bank support or advice. The
Krishna-Godavari Project is important in this regard since it constitutes
approximately one-quarter of ONGC-s exploration efforts over the next three
years. Following discussions with the Bank, ONGC agreed to: (i) concentrate
the exploration efforts on a smaller area and scale down the project size
reflecting both ONGC's technical capabilities and economic considerations;
(ii) reduce the considerable risks in the drilling program by introducing
technical assistance, experienced foreign contractors and technical
precautions; and (iii) improve the cost effectiveness of the project by
maximizing the use of information through an integrated onshore, inner-shelf,
outer-shelfl/ geological evaluation and by introducing a balanced drilling
program in these three environments in terms of potentially large discoveries
with high cost and technical risks on one hand, and potentially modest
discoveries with lower cost and technical risks on the other hand
(para 4.05).
III. THE PROJECT
Introduction
3.01     The Krishna-Godavari basin, located on the east coast of India about
375 km north of Madras, has the potential to become a major new oil province.
The principal geologic feature of the basin is a very thick deltaic sequence
resulting from the seaward progradation (outbuilding) of the ancestral Krishna
and Godavari river systems. On the basis of present information the basin is
known to contain good source rocks and reservoirs and numerous well defined
structures. The stratigraphy and structure of the basin resemble those of a
1/ The offshore margin of a continent is subdivided into the Continental
Shelf (coastline to approximately 200 m isobath) and the Continental Slope and
Rise (from edge of shelf to deep ocean abyssal plan, at depths usually of,
3000 m or more). In this report the term outer shelf refers to the offshore
area from about 165 m water depth to the very upper part of the slope at 300 m
water depth. The term inner shelf refers to the offshore area in less than
165 m water depth. This subdivision is convenient since it indicates
different offshore drilling conditions and equipment required, as well as
somewhat different types of petroleum prospects.

number of highly productive basins worldwide, particularly the Niger Delta in
Nigeria. The oil and gas discoveries already made in Krishna-Godavari confirm
that hydrocarbons have been generated and hence confirm the prospectivity of
the area as a possible future major source of oil and gas. By analogy with
comparable deltaic areas it can be expected that the structure and
stratigraphy will be complex, and while petroleum reserves may be large,
individual oil and gas fields may be small. Reservoirs in this type of basin
tend to be discontinuous, and large structures are often located in the deep
water, high cost outer shelf areas. Inner shelf prospects, although smaller,
are lower-cost and also present interesting possibilities. Furthermore, in
the Krishna-Godavari basin, the onshore prospects, in block faulted
structures, are also very interesting even though of an entirely different
nature. Bank staff in discussions with ONGC have stressed the importance, in
this complex geologic environment, of obtaining an integrated interpretation
of the entire onshore-inner shelf-outer shelf area through continuous and
comprehensive seismic coverage and the selection of well locations on the
basis of an economic appraisal of each prospect. While more intensive
exploration of the area presents significant challenges, the Krishna-Godavari
basin is the only basin in India where exploration efforts to date provide
sufficient evidence that an accelerated exploration effort could be successful
and result in major additions to national petroleum reserves.
Exploration Activity in the Krishna-Godavari Basin
3.02     ONGC's onshore exploration activities in the Krishna Godavari basin
routinely began in 1959 with surface geologic surveys, reconnaissance
geophysical surveys, and shallow core drilling; these activities continued
into the early 1970s. With the availability of modern seismic surveys, a more
rigorous exploration effort began in 1974 onshore and in 1978 offshore. These
surveys indicated a highly prospective sedimentary section, much more so than
originally thought.
3.03     The initial drilling began in 1978 onshore at the Narasapur-l
location (see map IBRD 16186R). The Narasapur-1 well suffered a blowout at a
depth of 4,043 m in the Mesozoic (Cretaceous) section so it was not tested at
that level, but the well did test several gas shows at shallower depths which
did not prove productive and the well was abandoned. Subsequently the Razole-
1 and Narasapur-2 wells were spudded 13 km and 1.5 km northeast of Narasapur-l
respectively. The Razole-1 reached its objective at 4,501 m and is being
prepared for testing. Gas zones were encountered in Lower Cretaceous
sandstones between 4,269 and 4,386 m (11 m net) and in fractured and weathered
basalt between 3,365 and 3,620 m (230 m gross). The Narasapur-2 also suffered
a blowout at about 3,401 m but ONGC will continue drilling down to 4,100
meters by side-tracking. The thicknesses and characteristics of the several
reservoirs encountered are not yet known, thus firm estimates of the size of
these finds cannot be given. However, if the present geological
interpretation is confirmed, a very significant discovery could result.
3.04     Offshore, drilling commenced in 1979.  The first offshore well, the
G-l-l well, tested oil and gas in Miocene sandstone reservoirs, at a gross
interval of 60 m combined. The oil producing interval tested 580 Bbl/d, and
the gas interval tested at 0.4 MMCMD of gas together with 210 Bbl/d of
condensate. Following completion of G-1-1, five wells have been drilled. Two
of them were prematurely abandoned at shallow depths due to wave height,



- 21 -
strong currents and possibly sea bottom slumpage; the other two, one of which
was located 3.5 km northwest of the C-1 discovery, were dry holes. The fifth
well was drilled in early 1982 in the G-3 structure on the inner shelf and was
also completed as a dry hole at a depth of 4,010 m. With present information,
the recoverable reserves from the G-1 prospect are estimated at about 60
million Bbl. This accumulation does not appear commercial in view of the
water depth at which it was encountered (263 m), unless additional productive
area or reservoir thickness can be demonstrated. One and perhaps two more
wells need be drilled to make this determination.
3.05     The results of seismic surveys and drilling to date are encouraging
because they confirm that hydrocarbons in significant quantities have been
generated in both onshore and offshore sequences, that good reservoirs are
present in the basin, and that there are numerous large structures. As
expected, the offshore structure and stratigraphy is complex and an adequate
test of the petroleum potential will require an extensive exploration
program. In addition to the structures tested so far, there are nine
prospects onshore and five on the outer shelf which remain to be drilled. On
the inner shelf, a recently completed seismic survey identified many
prospects. Therefore, a sufficient inventory of prospects is virtually
certain to exist to support a substantial drilling program in the basin,
particularly if it is recognized that some of the prospects will require more
than one exploratory well for proper evaluation (Annex 3.1 provides a detailed
description of past exploration activity and geology of the basin).
The Project
a. Objectives
3.06     The Project consists of the 1982/83 - 1985/86 slice of ONGC-s
exploration program in the Project area (para 3.07). The principal objective
of the Project is to establish the commercial potential of this area, lbth
onshore and offshore, and to test the most promising oil and gas plays- -
Specifically the onshore component aims at: (i) improving the definition of
known deep prospects and identifying and detailing new prospects by seismic
methods; and (ii) accelerating the drilling program to evaluate the prospects
currently identified. The offshore component aims at: (i) integrating the
geology of the onshore and offshore and identifying prospects in the inner
shelf by means of a seismic survey in the previously unexplored shallow water
area; (ii) accelerating the drilling program on the many prospects (yet to be
precisely defined) on the inner shelf and on the identified prospects on the
outer shelf; and (iii) improving on the definition of offshore prospects
through an additional conventional infill seismic survey. Another objective
of the Project is to strengthen ONGC-s capability in the design of exploration
programs, the drilling of deep high-pressure gas zones, and drilling in the
deep water, outer shelf environment. Properly implemented, this Project
should enable ONGC to substantially evaluate the petroleum prospects of the
Krishna-Godavari basin.

b. Description
3.07      The Project has been defined following extensive discussions between
Bank staff, GOI and ONGC officials.  The scope and area of the Project reflect
the encouraging results of past exploration efforts, ONGC's implementWion
capability, the state of the art in offshore drilling and development- and
the importance of maximizing the cost effectiveness of the exploration
investments. The geographic area to be explored has been limited to ibout
half of the Krishna-Godavari basin and covers approximately 17,000 km (see
Map IBRD 16186R) thereby restricting the Project area to include only that
part where ONGC has already made significant exploration investments (in
excess of US$70 million to date) resulting in discoveries. Nearby areas (
offshore and onshore) have been subsequently included in the second offering
of exploration acreage (para. 2.15) to foreign oil companies.
3.08      The Project will comprise the following items:
a. Onshore
Seismic Surveys: Approximately 1,000 line-km of high resolution seismic
lines with the objective of improving the quality of data acquisition,
recording and processing and thus obtain a better definition of deep
structures; if successful, the shooting and processing parameters derived
in this work will be used to improve results of future surveys.
Completion of the remaining 727 line-km out of a total of 2,400 line-km of
conventional seismic surveys designed to identify other prospects.
Drilling: Twelve wells will be drilled of which five wells will be
targeted on the deep, high gas pressure prospects to an average depth of
4,500 m; four wells are planned to explore the Upper Cretaceous section
with an average depth of 4,000 m; and three wells will be drilled to
shallower objectives at an average depth of 3,250 m.
b. Offshore
Seismic Surveys: Approximately 3,500 line-km of seismic coverage of the
very shallow water area, and up to 4,000 line-km of conventional infill
seismic in the remaining offshore area of the Project;
Drilling: Eleven exploratory wells on anticipated inner shelf prospects
to an average depth of 4,000 m and five exploratory wells on outer shelf
prospects to an average depth of 3,500 m.
c. Technical Assistance
External technical assistance to ONGC for supervision of drilling, testing
and completion of wells in the harsh outer shelf environment, as well as
1/  Although the technology now exists to drill structures at water depths
beyond 200 m, the technology to develop fields at such water depths is still
in its infancy. Therefore, despite the fact that many structures have been
located at water depths exceeding 200 m, the exploratory drilling effort in
these areas has been sharply reduced.



- 23 -
in the deep, high-pressure, onshore area. Additional technical
assistance, which is desirable but not essential is also being
considered. This will be further discussed with ONGC during project
implementation. Such assistance may cover: (i) quality control of
geophysical data acquisition and processing; and (ii) additional insights
into the geology and controls on the accumulation of oil and gas in the
Krishna-Godavari basin from a senior geologist experienced in deltaic
basins elsewhere.
3.09     Petroleum exploration programs, by their nature, are subject to
modifications as new information becomes available. Therefore, the components
of the Project could, with justification, be significantly altered during the
implementation period, particularly the detailed scope and location of seismic
surveys, as well as well locations and drilling programs. Furthermore, as
explained above, some of the prospects have not yet been sufficiently defined
to permit a judicious choice of drilling locations. Therefore, the initial
program in the Project area agreed upon between ONGC and the Bank during
negotiations will need to be continuously adjusted as the Project proceeds,
and therefore, will be revised from time to time. It will be submitted for
review and comments by the Bank on an annual basis starting in April 1983, and
whenever it is significantly revised; this will include a detailed review of
drilling locations and their justification as well as drilling/testing
programs. During negotiations, assurances were received that ONGC will not
proceed with implementation of the program, or any of its revisions, without
giving the Bank a reasonable opportunity to comment on it. The above
arrangements are considered satisfactory, and have evolved out of the
extensive dialogue the Bank has already had with ONGC on the definition of the
Project.
Execution
3.10     Until recently, the Krishna-Godavari exploration program was carried
out by two distinct units of ONGC, one in charge of the offshore, and the
other of the onshore activities.  This situation was unsatisfactory, as both
the onshore and the offshore portions are part of the same basin, and results
in one area can have an impact on the program in the other.  Furthermore, both
units had offices in Madras, which functioned independently. Following
discussions with Bank staff, ONGC reorganized the operations into a single
Madras Division headed by a General Manager to oversee both the onshore and
offshore activities in the southeast part of India, including the Krishna-
Godavari basin. The Bombay Offshore Project (BOP), which is in charge of all
offshore activities in India, will oversee the Madras Division. As a result,
all the activities in the Krishna-Godavari basin will be under the
responsibility of one unit of ONGC.
3.11     The Madras Division of BOP will be in charge of the execution of the
Project, with the support, as required, of ONGC central services based at
headquarters (Dehra Dun) and of BOP based in Bombay. With regard to specific
arrangements for the execution of the Project, these can be summarized as
follows:



- 24 -
Onshore
Seismic:  The high resolution seismic will be carried out by a
foreign contractor, while the conventional seismic by two
ONGC crews.
Drilling: The five deep, high gas pressure wells will be drilled by
foreign contractors. The two ONGC rigs will be redeployed
to drill the four deep wells with the Upper Cretaceous as
objective and the three wells on shallower prospects. ONGC
will obtain technical assistance to help supervise the
drilling of the initial five deep wells. During
negotiations, ONGC confirmed that it will conclude this
technical assistance agreement before the first of such
wells penetrate a high gas pressure zone.
Offshore
Seismic:  The shallow water survey, and the infill seismic, will be
carried out by foreign contractors.
Drilling: Eight of the inner shelf wells are planned to be drilled by
an anchored drillship owned and operated by a foreign
contractor. Three are planned to be drilled by a
dynamically positioned (D-P) drillship, during bad weather
windows when drilling in the outer shelf will be
suspended. The outer shelf wells will be drilled by the
dynamically positioned drillship owned and operated by a
foreign contractor. ONGC has already contracted Cor'pagnie
Francaise des Petroles (CFP, France), a maior oil company,
to assist in the supervision of the drilling in the outer
shelf; in order to further reduce the risks associated with
drilling in this environment: (i) a detailed bottom survey
including bathymetry and sea-bed sampling will be carried
out prior to drilling each location; and (ii) to the extent
possible, wells will be located 250 m shoreward of the
shelf slope break.
The above arrangements are satisfactory. During negotiations, assurances were
also obtained that ONGC will continue to employ consultants whose
qualifications, experience and terms of reference are satisfactory to the Bank
for the initial wells to be drilled on the outer shelf. The onshore drilling
technical assistance, which would normally involve a six-day work week but on
occasion require a seven-day work week, is estimated to cost about US$20,000
per man-month inclusive of fees, overhead, travel and subsistence expenses
(but excluding Indian income taxes). Other specialized technical consultancy
(e.g., geophysical analyses, reservoir evaluation, geochemical studies, etc.),
that ONGC may decide to call upon if needed, would cost from US$15,000 to
US$20,000 per man-month. The technical assistance and consultancy (excluding
offshore outer-shelf drilling) may involve about 150 man-months. The offshore
drilling technical assistance with CFP initially covers eighteen months for
three wells (one inner-shelf and two outer shelf including the well currently
drilling) drilled by the D-P vessel. The assistance involves two teams, each



- 25 -
with five experts (four on board the drillship and one onshore) rotating every
four weeks. The CFP personnel are on call twenty-four hours each day every
day of the week. The estimated average cost (including overheads, travel and
subsistence) of the CFP technical assistance is about US$23,500 per man-
month.1/
Implementation Schedule
3.12     Onshore, the two ONGC seismic crews are expected to complete their
activities by April 1983 and data processing and interpretation should be
completed by the end of 1983. The special seismic onshore program, to be
carried out by a foreign contractor is expected to begin in October 1982 and
be completed, including processing and interpretation, in January 1984.
Onshore drilling by the two ONGC rigs will continue throughout the Project
period, while the foreign contractors are expected to commence drilling in
early 1983 and complete their activities approximately two years later.
3.13     Offshore, the shallow water seismic program, is expected to be
carried out in the favorable weather seasons in 1982-1984. The dynamically
positioned drillship started drilling in July 1982 on the G-13-1 location,
while the anchored drillship is expected to begin drilling in November 1982.
Both drillships will remain in the Project area until at least late 1985. The
implementation schedule appears in Annex 3.2.
Estimated Cost
3.14     The cost of the Project is estimated at US$633.8 million, including
contingencies and custom duties. The foreign exchange component is estimated
at US$398.9 million, or about 63% of total cost. The detailed cost estimate
appears in Annex 3.3; supporting assumptions appear in Annex 3.4. The cost
estimate can be summarized as follows:

Items Proposed for Bank Financing
3.16     The specific items selected for Bank financing were agreed between
ONGC as well as the Bank with the view of ensuring both a high technical
quality for the most critical items of the Project and the most effective
implementation arrangement. The items include: (i) the specialized onshore
high-resolution seismic and shallow water seismic surveys as well as the
conventional infill seismic survey to be carried out by foreign contractors;
(ii) those highly specialized technical well services, drilling materials and
supplies, and equipment and materials for completion of successful onshore
wells (deep and high pressure), which ONGC will import, after ICB or after
soliciting bids from the few qualified suppliers; and (iii) the foreign
drilling contracts (i.e., rig-hire charges) covering the most difficult
drilling conditions, such as the deep, high-pressure onshore wells and the
outer shelf wells. The aggregate foreign exchange requirements of all these
items, including the front-end fee which the Government requested the Bank to
finance, amounts to US$165.5 million. A Bank loan for this amount is proposed
and the allocation of the Bank funds is shown below:

Financing Plan
3.17     The proposed Bank loan of US$165.5 million would represent about 26%
of the total Project cost, and about 41% of the foreign exchange cost of the

Proiect, including contingencies.   The balance (US$468.3 million) of "he
capital cost not covered by the Bank leoar_ which would use up only about 570 o f
ONGCCs Internal cashl generation during 1982/83-1985/86, can be assu.me            '

(T oan 1925-IN), the proposed loan for the Krishna-Godavari Exploration
Project, and a loanr for Lhe South Bassein Gas Development (para. 2.25)
presently under consideration.
The aggregpte Bank disbursements for the 1989f83 - 1985/86 investment program
is projected tG be abGut US$454 million, or approximately 4% of ONGCs overall
investment program and about 6% of ONGC's total foreign exchange requirements.
3.18      In recent years, the strategy of GOT and ONGC has increasingly been
to diversify the sources of financing to ONGC, essentially by securing
supplier's credits when advantageous, and by Eurodoll-ar borrowirgs otherwise.
The policy, adopted in late 1981 by the Go-vernment, is to utilize as much
external financing as feasible to meet th.e foreign excnange requirements of
ONGCs investment program; as a regular practice, ONGC now requests financing
proposals as __ issues bids for major. procurem-ent items.  Once ONGC has
evaluated the bids, a decision cn final award, taking into account the most
suitable financing arrangement (e.g., supplier's credits, ccmmercial loans,
bilateral loans), is taken by the Government.  During 1980/81 and 1981/82,
against a total foreign exchange requirement of about US$1.1 billion, ONGC
drew dow,n about UJS$230 million (21%) conmercial loans/credits, and about
US$385 million (3-5%) from official development assistance loans, with the
balance (44%) ccvered by foreign exchange purchased with internally-generated



- 30 -
funds. Following the recently adopted procedure described above, it is
expected that a substantial proportion (40-60%) of ONGC's foreign exchange
requirements for investments during the period 1982/83 - 1985/86 could be met
with foreign commercial loans/credits. And as mentioned earlier (para. 2.24)
ONGC has already obtained about US$245 million of commercial loans/credits
during the first five months of 1982/83, in addition to about US$57 million in
bilateral loans. With several major bid packages requesting for financing
proposals just recently tendered, and more being,prepared for tendering
shortly, roughly US$200 million more of commercial financing can be expected
for the rest of 1982/83. Given that the worldwide demand for petroleum
equipment is slackening and interest rates are expected to ease somewhat, it
is reasonable to expect that ONGC can mobilize substantial commercial loans
towards its investment program during 1982/83 - 1885/86. As the financial
requirements are mobilized to support an ongoing investment program, and are
not ascribed to particular projects, (for instance a drilling rig can be
util'zed in various parts of India, both for exploration and development), the
financing plan is presented for ONGC as a whole and not for the Project only.
3.19     The estimated schedule of disbursements of the Bank loan appears in
Annex 3.6. The loan would be made to GOI at an interest rate of 11.6% per
year for 20 years including a five-year grace period with a front-end fee of
1.5%. GOI would onlend the proceeds of the Bank loan to ONGC at an interest
rate of 12%, over 20 years including a five-year grace period. The foreign
exchange risk would be borne by GOI. The 12% onlending rate is expected to
exceed domestic inflation rates which are not anticipated to be over 8%
annually in the next five years. Execution of the subsidiary Loan Agreement
on ter- and conditions satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of
effectiveness of the proposed loan.
Procurement and Disbursements
3.20     The exploration program in the Krishna-Godavari basin is an ongoing
Program with which the Bank has been associated since 1980. The availability
of equipment has been critical to an efficient execution of the program,
particularly in 1980 and 1981, when drilling rigs were in extremely short
supply. ONGC secured the two drilling rigs required for the offshore
exploration program and the anchored drillship started drilling in 1979 while
the D-P vessel started operations in late 1981. Although the shortage of
offshore drilling rigs has now eased, it was sound from ONGC's standpoint to
secure the rigs at that time. The contract for the shallow water seismic
survey was signed in June 1982 (Western Geophysics, USA) and the high-
resolution onshore seismic contract is expected to be signed by August/
September 1982. As a result, the items for Bank financing contain a
considerable level of advance contracting, both for offshore rig-hire charges
(US$34 million including contingencies), and for seismic surveys (US$24
million including contingencies).
3.21     Bank agreement for advance contracting was only given after:  (i) it
was ensured that ONGC followed procurement practices consistent with IBRD
guidelines; (ii) ONGC and GOI were advised that the seismic contracts would be
awarded at their own risk, and did not commit the Bank in any way to make a
loan for this Project; and (iii) the Executive Directors were advised of this
possibility through the Monthly Operational Summary. Retroactive financing



- 31 -
for expenditures (on downpayments and progress payments for the seismic
surveys and offshore rig-hire charges) made after May 1, 1982 of up to
US$6 million is provided under the proposed Bank loan.
3.22     With respect to both the high-resolution onshore and shallow water
offshore seismic surveys, ONGC has followed international tendering procedures
consistent with Bank guidelines by solicitina bids from almost all the known
qualified suppliers for these highly specialized seismic surveys and by having
the Bank review the bidding documents, bid evaluation and contract terms
before these were finalized. Eleven and eight firms were requested to submit
offers for the high-resolution onshore and the shallow water seismic surveys
respectively.
3.23     With regard to the outer shelf drilling, ONGC initially advertised
for a regular drillship (not dynamically positioned), because no D-P vessel
was available at that time, although a D-P vessel was technically superior and
was preferred for drilling the outer shelf wells. But in the process of
evaluating and negotiating the bids, ONGC was offered by Sedco (USA), a D-P
vessel which had just become available. At that time (1981), offshore rigs
were in short supply and ONGC was fortunate to obtain the D-P vessel. The
Bank therefore agreed to accept advance contracting for the D-P vessel and
finance 25% of the rig-hire charges on the grounds that: (i) new rigs will
require a long time to mobilize; (ii) the rates are reasonable; (iii) the
experience and capability of the contractor is as good as those of any
potential competitor; and (iv) the contractor has performed satisfactorily and
also provided ONGC with valuable advice on outer shelf drilling. Any
extensions or renewals of the existing contract needed to complete the Project
will be on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
3.24     For the deep onshore drilling rigs, the infill offshore seismic
survey, most drilling materials and supplies, and all equipment and materials
for completions of successful onshore wells (US$75 million), international
competitive bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines will
be followed. The: (i) specialized well services (US$24 million for logging,
mud engineering/logging, cementing, testing, completion) which have only a few
qualified suppliers; (ii) minor items whose CIF value are less than US$200,000
each; and (iii) items in short supply and needed for the timely completion of
the Project, will be procured by soliciting bids from a list of qualified
suppliers agreed with the Bank. The aggregate amount of such procurement
under items (ii) and (iii), will not exceed US$6 million. For the purposes of
bid evaluation, a preference of 15% or the custom duty, whichever is less,
will be provided to qualified local manufacturers of goods procured through
ICB. Bid invitation and evaluation will be the responsibility of ONGC.
3.25     Disbursements would cover 100% of foreign expenditures or 100% of ex-
factory prices for locally manufactured goods under Bank-financed contracts,
except those for the offshore rig-hire charges, where disbsursements would
cover 25% of foreign expenditures. Activities financed by the Bank are
expected to be completed by August 1985 while the entire Project is expected
to be completed by December 1985.
Ecology and Safety
3.26     During Project implementation, measures will be taken to protect the



- 32 -
safety of individuals and protect the environment from any damage. Seismic
operations of the type visualized are conducted continuously worldwide without
particular concern. Drilling contractors are experienced at maintaining safe
operations and ONGC follows standards developed for North Sea operations with
regard to inspections, safety drill, waste handling and other concern for the
marine environment. However, drilling operations can pose problems of blow
out and/or oil spill. It has been agreed that the offshore wells will not be
drilled below the top of the abnormal pressure zone without special safety
precautions, and other steps (para. 4.03) have also been taken to minimize
this risk. The sea-bottom in the Project area does not have reefs or mollusc
beds, but rather silt and mud, and is therefore not a delicate ecological
environment. The onshore deep, high pressure gas wells do pose a hazard and
for this reason a foreign contractor experienced in this type of operation
will be used. No back-up provisions are provided for blow outs except the
drilling of a relief well. In the unlikely event of a serious offshore oil
spill, clean-up equipment would have to be mobilized from outside India
(Singapore), for which adequate insurance coverage will be provided
(para. 5.09).
IV. PROJECT RISKS AND JUSTIFICATION
4.01     There is no doubt that the Krishna Godavari basin is highly
prospective and that the likelihood of establishing commercial reserves in
this area in the future is high. As is the case with most exploration
projects, however, not enough is known at this stage about the physical
properties of potential future discoveries to permit calculation of a
meaningful economic rate of return. The justification for this project rests
on a qualitative assessment of three types of risks: geological, technical
and economic. The conclusions are that the geological risk is fairly low and
that, after careful evaluation by ONGC and the Bank, the technical and
economic risks have been minimized through an appropriate and flexible design
of the project.
4.02     The geological risk is that insufficient volumes of hydrocarbons will
be found to justify the project. As discussed above (paras. 3.01 - 3.05), the
drilling results in the area to date confirm that hydrocarbons have been
generated in both onshore and offshore sequences and that there are numerous
large structures yet to be explored. The fact that three wells over a
distance of 13 km have now penetrated the Mesozoic (Cretaceous) deep high-
pressure gas reservoir suggests that a commercial gas discovery may already
have been made onshore. The thickness and character of the reservoir, the
composition of the gas and the amount of associated liquids will be largely
resolved by late-1982 when the Razole-l well is tested and the Narasapur-2
well reaches total depth. In addition to these indicated discoveries,T a
large number and variety of additional prospects have been and will continue
to be identified since oil and/or gas shows have been noted throughout the
stratigraphic column. The geological risk of the project as a whole,
1/ An indicated discovery, in oil industry terminology, is a discovery where
oil or gas have been produced, but the well has not been completed.



- 33 -
therefore, appears to be low considering the large number and variety of
prospects identified and the proven existence of hydrocarbon generation.
4.03     The technical risk is that the Project may not be completed
efficiently due to difficulty in drilling and testing the exploratory wells.
The principal causes of this risk are the presence of abnormally high
formation pressures in the deeper part of the onshore wells and the drilling
difficulties on the outer shelf related to the ability of drilling rigs to
maintain position due to waves, currents, and/or sediment slumpage. To reduce
these risks it has been decided to discontinue drilling all wells, except
those with a planned casing program for high pressure objectives, as soon as
abnormal formation pressures have been penetrated and mud weights in excess of
1.55 specific gravity (13 lbs/gallon) are required to continue drilling.
Furthermore, it has been decided to engage a foreign contractor experienced in
drilling and testing high pressure formations. The risks associated with
maintaining rig position on the deeper water outer shelf wells have been
reduced by: (i) the introduction of detailed bathymetry and bottom condition
surveys at all proposed locations, in advance of drilling; (ii) avoidance of
drilling, to the extent possible, during the worst weather periods; (iii) the
understanding that ONGC will locate the initial outer shelf wells at least 250
m shoreward of the shelf slope boundary unless otherwise agreed with the Bank;
(iv) the provision for competent drilling supervisors from a major oil company
(CFP - France) to provide technical assistance for at least the initial outer
shelf operations; and (v) the use of a dynamically positioned drilling ship.
4.04     The economic risks are perhaps the most important.  Even if oil
and/or gas is found and the drilling program proceeds without serious
problems, the recoverable quantities discovered may not be sufficient to yield
an acceptable return on the investment capital required. This risk is
considerably greater in the outer shelf portion of the project where large
discoveries with substantial producing rates per well would be needed to
justify the large investment required to develop those deep offshore fields.
However, the outer shelf area also holds the greatest promise for large
accumulations of oil and gas. To illustrate the differential economics of the
various drilling environments, calculations have been made to show the minimum
field size (i.e., recoverable quantities) that would be required to yield a
20% real rate of return in each environment. As shown in Annex 4.1, the range
is from less than 10 million barrels of oil or 3.5 billion Nm3 of gas onshore
to 150 million barrels of oil in the deep offshore. Based on existing
geological knowledge, the potential accumulation in each environment is at
least as large as these figures. However, since it is impossible to predict
where discoveries will be made, the economic risk of the overall Project will
be minimized by: (i) beginning with a balanced program of exploration across
all economically feasible areas; and (ii) maintaining the flexibility to alter
the scope of the Project based on economic comparisons between areas as more
information becomes available.
4.05     With respect to the scope, considerable modification were made to the
original proposal of ONGC, to reach the design agreed during negotiations
(Annex 4.2); as a result more emphasis is now being given to the onshore and
inner shelf components. The program now reflects a balance of: (i) different
prospective areas onshore, on the inner shelf and on the outer shelf; (ii) age
of targets and type of trap; and (iii) the coverage of the project area. As
the project is implemented, the technical assistance referred to above will



- 34 -
provide for maximum evaluation of the data provided by every well. The scope
of the Project will be continously adjusted in light of this information and
the Bank will undertake a detailed review annually of the revised program
(para. 3.09). A major focus of this review will be the comparative economics
of the various exploration prospects. Through these means, and on the basis
of the agreed initial program, the economic risk of the Project will be
minimized and is acceptable.
4.06     In summary, the Project risks have been recognized in advance, and
the Project design as now agreed between the Bank and ONGC has been developed
to minimize them. Considering: (i) the magnitude of the potential petroleum
resources of the Krishna-Godavari basin; (ii) the implications of this
potential for India's future development prospects; and (iii) that the risks
appear to be manageable, the Project is justified, and constitutes a priority
component of India's energy program.
V. THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMMISSION (ONGC)
General
5.01     The Oil and Natural Gas Commission is a Government-owned statutory
body created in 1959 by an act of Parliament to "plan, promote and implement
the development of petroleum resources and the production and sale of
petroleum products produced by it". ONGC's statutes provide that it is a
corporate body with power to acquire, hold and dispose of property. ONGC also
has authority to contract and borrow. The Commission consists of a Chairman
and not less than two, but not more than eight, Members appointed by the
Government for a period of five years.
5.02     At present, the Commission consists of the Chairman, six full-time
Members (Finance, Materials, Personnel, Exploration, Offshore and Onshore) and
two part-time Members (representing the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry
of Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertilizers). All decisions of the Commission
must be approved by a majority of the Members. ONGC owns Hydrocarbons India
Ltd, a subsidiary which is responsible for the Commission's ventures abroad
(Iran).
Organization and Management
5.03     The Commission acts very much as an operating board of directors and
is responsible for setting ONGC-s policies. Its plans and budgets have to be
approved by the Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry
of Petroleum, Chemicals and Fertilizers, before they are sanctioned by
Parliament. Over time, the Commission has evolved into a full-fledged oil
company. In many areas, ONGC has developed an adequate in-house capability.
However, aware of the rapid technological progress in oil exploration and
petroleum engineering, ONGC continues to use foreign consultants when the in-
house capability is insufficient or to verify critical results obtained in-
house. ONGC has followed a consistent policy of ensuring that techniques
developed in India reflect the latest technology available worldwide and are
properly applied.



- 35 -
5.04     The main administrative and financial functions (planning,
procurement and stores, accounting, personnel, computer activities, etc.) are
centralized in the corporate headquarters at Dehra Dun, along with the main
research and development, and training facilities.  Operational staff are
divided among three regional offices (Central, lestern and Eastern Regions)
for onshore operations and the Bombay Offshore Project (BOP) for offshore
operations. Prior to 1974 most of the operational decisions were taken
centrally from Dehra Dun and the Regional Managers had little, if any,
operational authority. In recent years, the decision-making process has been
decentralized to the regions, which now have operational responsibility and
the authority to commit funds within their approved budget. ONGC-s
Organization Chart appears at Annex 5.1.
5.05     The Bombay Offshore Project (BOP) is in chnarge of offshore
exploration and of the development of the offshore fields. Hleaded by the
Member (Offshore), BOP has been the focus of intense activity over the past
seven years with the implementation of the successive phases of the Bombay
High development, and the substantial increase 4n offshore exploration
activity. The increase in its staff has been particularly rapid: from 20 in
1974 to 600 in 1977 to 2,800 at present. The staff is highly motivated by the
importance of the offshore projects to the Indian economy. Six General
Managers report to the Member (Offshore): Engineering and Planning;
Construction; Operations; Production; Exploration; and Materials. Also three
Directors report to him (two for Finance, and one for Personnel and
Administration). In addition, a Management Services Group assists the Member
in Project Planning and Monitoring as well as in special duties (i.e. safety
and environment).  This recent organization structure reflects the increasing
scope and complexity of assignments given to BOP; it also aims for greater
delegation of authority, as well as a more equitable distribution of work
loads, hence for instance the appointment of two General Managers in charge of
offshore development activities and two Finance Directors to assist
respectively in Operations and Construction. The Madras Division, whose
Organization Chart appears at Annex 5.2, is part of BOP (para. 3.10). While
major policy decisions are still being taken at Dehra Dun and New Delhi, BOP
has in recent years been delegated sufficient powers to be able to run the
offshore program effectively and efficiently.
Staffing and Training
5.06     As of April 1, 1982, ONGC had an oveirall staff of approximately
29,500, including 5,500 technical officers (engineers, geologists,
geophysicists, etc.). ONGC gives strong emphasis to the training of
personnel, particularly in its offshore operations. Personnel are given
training by various institutions operating in India (management, finance, data
processing, geology) and abroad (oil companies, laboratories, contractors
facilities), in addition to a wide array of courses and seminars given in-
house (ranging from highly technical subjects to "organizational
effectiveness" for senior staff). Particularly inr the oil industry, where
techniques are evolving rapidly, courses and seminars are important to keep
the staff abreast of the latest developments.
Management Information Systems
5.07     ONGC has developed in recent years adequate management information



- 16 -
systems; particularly in the case of BOP, a comprehensive monthly report is
prepared, which highlights to management the status of the different
activities and enables the Commission to take corrective actions whenever the
need arises. During the implementation of the first two Bombay High projects,
ONGC has provided the Bank, on a timely basis, quarterly technical progress
reports and, on a semi-annual basis, financial and statistical reports.
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that ONGC will continue to
provide the Bank with periodic progress and semi-annual unaudited financial
reports during project implementation, and a Project Completion Report when
the Project is completed. These periodic reports are to be submitted within
45 days after the end of the period covered.
Accounts and Audit
5.08     Each project unit has a Finance and Accounts Section reporting to the
Project Manager and to the Member (Finance) at ONGC's headquarters. The
Internal Audit Section is under the Member, Finance, in Dehra Dun, and
performs satisfactorily. ONGC's accounts are audited by the Comptroller and
Auditor General, which is acceptable to the Bank. While ONGC's accounts are
generally available four months after the end of the fiscal year at the
latest, GOI rules and regulations provide that ONGC's audited accounts cannot
be made public before they have been approved by Parliament. During
negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Commission's audited accounts
will be submitted to the Bank not later than twelve months after the end of
the fiscal year.
insurance
5.09     ONGC has adequate insurance coverage for its existing offshore
installation, equipment, vessels, etc., with several insurance companies in
India which are reinsured in the international market. Insuring follows the
international practice, whereby designs are certified by independent
agencies. ONGC self-insures onshore facilities which is reasonable given the
scope and extent of its onshore activites. ONGC's insurance coverage for its
existing facilities is satisfactory. Under the proposed Project, agreement
was reached during negotiations that insurance coverage satisfactory to the
Bank will be obtained by either or both ONGC and the drilling contractors for
the five deep onshore wells and all the offshore wells included in the
Project. Such insurance coverage will at least include: physical damage to
property and removal of wreck, and foreign contractor's personnel. For the
offshore wells, the insurance will also cover costs for the control of the
well and redrilling in case of blow-outs, fire or cratering; and clean-up
costs and pollution liability.
ONGC's Investment Program (1982/1983 - 1987/88)
5.10     ONGC is now in the third year of the 1980/81 - 1984/85 Plan.  The
Plan which was revised in August 1981, now provides for expenditures of
approximately Rs 97 billion (US$10.8 billion), in current prices against the
initial estimate of Rs 40 billion (US$4.4 billion) for the same period. This
more than doubling of expenditure reflects the introduction, over the past two
years, of the accelerated program for development of the Bombay High field and
its neighboring structures as well as the accelerated exploration program.

5.11     The 1982/83 - 1987/88 investment program is based on ONGC-s revised
five-year Plan, that was submitted in August 1981, and a ten year exploraCion
and development program, submitned in March 1982, and currently under
consideratiron by the Governmert; it is reviewed in detail in Annex 5.3.
Proposed investments over 1982/83 - 1985/86 arnount to Rs 111.5 billIon
(US$12.8 bill'Ion) averaging nearly Rs 29 billion (US$3.1 billion) per year.
The proposed 19892'83 - 1985/86 inAvestment planr can be sumarized as followrs-

5.12     The objactive of the current investment program is to increase ONGC's
production of oil from 13.1  million tons in 1981/82 to 46.5 million tons in
1989/90.-!/ Meeting this objecti.e requires a considerable exploration effort as
well as maximum developmdent and optimum operating efficiency of all known field
reserves. Bombay High currently contributes over 609 of oil and gas production in
India and most of the planned production in.creases wiill result from further
development of this province.  By 1984,'85, Bombay High will have reached maximum
production, and by about 1989/90 production will start declining as the reservoir
is depleted.  In the absence of new major discoveries, the reserves/production
ratio will decline from about 24 years at present to only 15 years in 1987.  This
emphasizes the importance of making large new discoveries in the coming years and
this is the iustification for the ambitious exploration program representing about
20% of total investment over the period.
5.13     Tne ONGC exploration strategy is to balance the program between areas of
lower risk and low potential with areas of higher risk but with greater potential
for discovering large new reserves.  During the 1982/83 - 1985/86 period, about
half of the exploration investment will be in producing areas in Assam, Gujarat
1/ The Plan therefore assumes a certain rate of discovery as ONGC-s current
commercial reserves can only sustain a production rate of 30 million tpy of
crude oil. The investment figures above, however, do not include provisions
for the development of future discoveries.

and Bombay High which in the near term hold promise of modest but more certain
additions to reserves. In addition, ONGC will continue the ongoing evaluation of
the Krishna-Godavari delta which is the most promising frontier area in India
today and which in the medium term could contribute major additions to petroleum
reserves. The Krishna-Godavari program, as planned, accounts for about 25% of the
total exploration program and about half of the program in non-producing areas
over 1982/83 - 1985/86. Additional wildcat exploration onshore and offshore is
planned in the Ganga basin, West Bengal, Rajasthan and the Himalayan foothills.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Introduction
6.01     ONGC-s financial and accounting systems, while governed by GOI
regulations, are gradually becoming similar to those of a commercial oil
company. While key financial parameters (selling prices, investment programs)
are decided upon by GOI, which also arranges all the external financing
requirements, ONGC has been able to operate in a financially responsible
fashion. Past policies have enabled ONGC to perform satisfactorily so far,
and it is expected that this will continue in the future.
Past Performance
6.02     ONGC's audited Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Sources and
Applications of Funds Statements over 1978/79 - 1981/82 appear at Annex 6.1.
ONGC's Income Statements over the past four years can be summarized as
follows:

a/ Unaudited results.
bi/ At 6% of Government Equity.
As the above table indicates, ONGC has experienced a steady growth in its
activities, primarily because of the expanding offshore production. The
results for 1980/81 are disappointing, due to the lengthy stoppage of
production in Assam (equivalent to 1.3 million tons of crude oil or about
Rs400 million of foregone revenues) on account of political disturbances.
Production in Assam has now returned to normal. The 1981/82 results reflect
both increases in oil production and selling prices (para 6.05).
6.03     Over the 1978/79 - 1981/82 period, ONGC's investments amounted to Rs
17.6 billion (US$2.0 billion) of which Rs 9.7 billion (US$1.1 billion) or 55%
was financed from internal cash generation.
6.04     The Balance Sheet, as of March 31, 1982, can be summarized as
follows:

Total                      18,397             2,044          100
As the above table indicates, ONGC is in a sound financial position with a
Debt/Equity ratio of 50:50, and a current ratio of 1.4. Over the past three
years, ONGC has obtained Rs 105 million (US$11.7 million) in equity contri-
butions from GOI. Most of the balance of its external financing requirements
was obtained from GOI in the form of long-term loans (including the IBRD Loan
1473-IN and Loan 1925-IN onlent by GOI to ONGC), and from the Oil Industry
Development Board (OIDB).  Its debt coverage ratio is high (7.9 in 1982).
6.05      The prices at which ONGC sells crude oil and natural gas to refining
companies and gas consuming industries are regulated by GOI. Prices to ONGC
were raised significantly in July 1981, and are currently as follows:
Oil and Gas Prices (Inclusive of Taxes)
Rs/ton                US$/Bbl
Crude Oil                          1,182                 17.28
Rs/1000 Nm3           US$/thousand SCF
Natural Gas
Offshore                       500-2,500               1.57-7.87
Onshore                         150-300                0.47-0.94
The price of crude oil of Rs 1,182/ton includes Rs 161/ton (US$2.35/Bbl) of
cess and royalties. Pipeline tolling fees are additional. While the crude
oil price is low when compared to international prices, ONGC-s financial
performance is expected to be satisfactory. Ultimate selling prices of
petroleum products in India (para. 2.07) are above import-parity so that the
price obtained by ONGC should be considered as a transfer price within the
public sector, with the difference accruing to GOI as current revenues.
6.06      The price of offshore gas is based on its intended use, whether as
feedstock or as fuel, and on the domestic price of the alternative feedstock



- il -
or fuel the gas is replacing. In general, the price of gas is lower when it
is used as feedstock than as fuel reflecting GOI's policy of pricing oil
products at a lower price when they are used as fertilizer feedstocks. It is
also priced lower when substituting for cheaper fuels (e.g. coal) compared to
the price when gas substitutes for more expensive fuels (e.g. fuel oil). On
average, ONGC receives about Rs 1,380/1000 Nm (US$4.58/b000 SCF) for offshore
gas, which is well above the cost of production and in line with the economic
value of the gas (fuel oil equivalent). Thus, the average level of gas prices
is currently satisfactory, but the price structure may need revisions as the
number and type of consumers change with expanding gas supplies.
6.07     In the case of t e onshore gas in Assam, the price is low, on average
only about Rs 150/1000 Nm , reflecting the surplus of associated gas which is
being flared in view of the small size of the market. In the case of the
onshore gas in Gujarat, where the demand for gas has alreaqy exceeded the
supply, the average price of the gas (about Rs 300/1000 Nm ) is heavily
influenced by the low price contained in old long-term contracts. As these
contracts are renewed or renegotiated (which ONGC is trying to do), prices are
being increased with the ultimate objective of applying the same principles as
those for offshore gas. Taking into account the overall quantities of onshore
gas involved, these revisions are expected to have a minimum impact on ONGC's
overall finances.
Financial Prospects
6.08     Financial projections over 1982/83-1987/88 appear at Annex 6.1;
supporting assumptions are at Annex 6.2. Important assumptions made in the
forecast are as follows: (i) prices of crude oil and natural gas to ONGC will
remain constant; (ii) the bulk of external financing requirements would be met
by borrowings so that GOI will no longer provide equity financing; and (iii)
no discovery of additional crude oil or gas would be made during the period
under review. Salient features of the forecast are as follows:
Financial Prospects
1982/83     1983/84    1984/85    1985/86
Total Sales (Billion Rs)                  24.8         32.7        39.9        43.3
Crude Oil Sales (Mill ion tons)            17.9        23.3        27.0        27.9
Gas Sales (Million Nm )                2,538        2,852       4,598       5,866
Net Profit (Million Rs)                7,854       10,306      10,426      17,313

Debt Service Coverage (Times)               9.9          6.8        5.7         5.5
As the above table indicates, ONGC's performance should remain satisfactory
during the period under review. There is always a risk, however, that in the
event of large discoveries, ONGC would have to borrow significant amounts
towards their development cost.  Therefore during negotiations, an assurance
was obtained that GOI will, from time to time, carry out a review of the
prices of crude oil and natural gas to ONGC, and set such prices at a level
which will enable ONGC to earn a return on capital employed, meet its debt

service requirements, maintain adequate working capital, and finance a
substantial portion of its proposed capital expansion. A similar covenant was
provided for under the first two loans, was observed and ONGC's performance
remained satisfactory over 1978/79 - 1981/82.
6.09     ONGC's financing plan over 1982/83 - 1985/86 can be summarized as
follows:

As the above table indicates, ONGC will be able to finance from internal
sources about 72% of its investment program. Such levels of internal
financing are not unusual for oil companies but unusually high- for public
sector enterprises.
6.10     Included in the long-term borrowings are disbursements under the
Second Bombay High Bank loan, the proposed loan for the Krishna Godavari
Project and another loan currently under consideration for the South Bassein
Offshore Gas Development Project. Thus, Bank lending would represent about
13% of ONGC's total borrowings and about 6% of the foreign exchange needs of
its investment program, during the 1982/83-85/86 period.
6.11     In addition, as it has done in the past, ONGC will seek financing
from foreign commercial sources. Such financing is expected to cover about
40% to 60% of future foreign exchange requirements (paras. 2.24 and 3.18).

Details of all loans incurred by ONGC up to early 1982/83, including the
associated debt service schedule, is shown in Annex 6.2.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01     During negotiations, assurances were obtained from GOI that:
(a) it will provide ONGC or cause ONGC to be provided with
sufficient funds to meet ONGC's financial requirements for the
Project, and onlend the Bank funds to ONGC on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank (paras. 3.17 and 3.19); and
(b) it will, from time to time, carry out a review of the prices of
crude oil and natural gas to ONGC and set such prices at a level
which will enable ONGC to earn a return on capital employed,
meet its debt service requirements, maintain adequate working
capital, and finance a substantial portion of its proposed
capital expansion (para. 6.08).
7.02     During negotiations, the following confirmations and agreements were
obtained from ONGC:
(a) the exploration program, including the drilling locations and
programs, will be submitted to the Bank for review on an annual
basis and whenever substantially revised (para. 3.09);
(b) it will employ consultants for the initial deep, high-pressure
onshore drilling and the outer-shelf drilling whose
qualification, experience and terms of reference are
satisfactory to the Bank. The technical assistance agreement
for deep onshore drilling will be concluded before drilling of
any deep, high-pressure onshore well reaches the high-pressure
zones (para. 3.11);
(c) periodic progress and financial reports will be submitted to the
Bank during Project implementation, and a Project Completion
Report when the Project is completed (para. 5.07);
(d) ONGC's audited accounts will be submitted to the Bank not later
than twelve months after the end of the fiscal year (para.
5.08); and
(e) ONGC and/or the drilling contractors will arrange appropriate
insurance coverage for the deep onshore and the offshore wells
to be drilled under the Project (para. 5.09).



- 44 -
7.03     Execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOI and ONGC under
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank would be a condition of
effectiveness (para. 3.19).
7.04     On the basis of the above assurances, the Project would be suitable
for a US$165.5 million loan to GOI for a term of twenty years, including a
five-year grace period.

KRISHNA-GODAVARI PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROJECT
GEOLOGY OF THE KRISHNA-GODAVARI BASIN
Location
1.       The Krishna-Godavari basin is located on the eastern side of the
Indian peninsula about 375 km north of Madras. The more prospective area for
petroleum covers some 30,000 km2, of which about 60% is onshore, 30% on the
Continental Shelf, and 10% in deeper water exceeding 200 m.
Geology
2.       The basin is a coastal margin type superimposed by a wedge of deltaic
sediments associated with the Krishna and Godavari rivers. Sediment
deposition began during the Lower Cretaceous period with a wedge of clastics
(sands and shales) being laid down parallel to the coast (NE/SW) grading from
non-marine landward to a marine environment seaward. This depositional cycle
apparently continued throughout the Cretaceous. These sediments rest on pre-
Cambrian basement or older sediments of Permo-Triassic age (the Gondwanda
Series analagous in part to the Karroo beds of Africa) deposited in narrow
grabens crossing the basement rocks normal to the present coastline. The
Cretaceous sediments are structured by a series of fault blocks parallel to
the coastline (Eastern Ghat trend) forming a series of horsts (ridges) and
grabens (sub-basins). The fault block structures are tilted (dip) seaward
with each successive ridge being encountered deeper in a southeast
direction. It is not clear whether the faulting was active during deposition
since the top of the sequence is either exposed at the surface or is truncated
by an unconformity when drilled in the subsurface. The block faulting drops
the Cretaceous below a level detected by seismic along a line coincident with
the present landward edge of the Krishna delta and some 15 km inland of the
landward edge of the Godavari delta. A sequence of basaltic flows are found
at the Cretaceous/Paleocene unconformity which conclude the block faulted
sequence.
3.       The deltaic wedge of Tertiary and Quaternary sediments (Paleocene to
Recent) unconformably overlie the Cretaceous. The deltaic wedge consists of a
series of prograding (outbuilding) sandstone and shale with sediments
deposited in deeper water being overlain with shallower water deposits. Down-
to-basin (gravity slide) faults occur at the position of the shelf-slope break
during each sedimentary cycle. Three of these fault zones have been
identified to date. They have an arcuate shape in plan view and anticlinal
"rollover" structures are formed on the down-thrown side of the faults.
Structuring is also affected by the plastic nature of the underlying deep
water shales which are abnormally pressured due to the rapid deposition of
more easily compacted overlying shallower water formations containing sand
beds (through which water of compaction can be expelled). The deltaic cycle
of deposition appears to have been temporarily interrupted during the Eocene
(middle Tertiary) when a period of slow sedimentation permitted the formation
of limestones and probably reefs at the edge of the shelf at that time. (See
Cross Section at appendix 1 of this Annex.)

Potential Hydrocarbons
4.       Potential accumulations of hydrocarbons may occur 4n the (rishna-
Godavari basin in the following situations:
(a) Cretaceous sandstone reservoirs in structural closures
(associated with fault blocks) beneath the Cretaceous/Paleocene
unconformity; -
(b) Cretaceous sandstone reservoirs trapped against down-thrown side
of fault blocks;
(c) Cretaceous sandstones reservoirs in lenticular bodies or other
up-dip barriers to permeability;
(d) Eocene limestone reef reservoirs or other up-dip barriers to
permeability;
(e) Paleocene to Plio-Miocene sandstone reservoirs associated with
rcllover closures on down-thrown side of gravi^ty faults; 1/
(f) Paleocene to Plio-Miocene sandstone reservoirs trapped against
up-thrown side of gravity faults;
(g) Paleocene to Plio-Miocene sandstone reservoirs associated with
closures induced by flowage of underlying undercompacted clays;
and
(h) Paleocene to Plio-Miocene sandstone reservoirs in lenticular
bodies or other up-dip barrier to permeability.
Past Exploration Effort
5.       ONGC's exploration in the Krishna-Godavari basin to date consists
of: (a) basin wide aeromagnetic surveyi; (b) 19,200 km of gravity surveys;
(c) Landsat photo coverage of 45,000 km ; (d) onshore seismic survey of about
8,100 line-km including 4,320 line-km of reflection data using common depth
methods (digital recording since 1974); (e) offshore seismic of about
10,500 line-km all but 500 line-km using common depth point methods with
digital recording; (f) detail surface geological studies covering 4,400 km2 of
outcrop area in the western edges of the basin; (g) 39 shallow bores holes to
complement the surface geological studies (average depth about 200 m);
(h) drilling of three onshore exploratory wells - Narasapur--i blew out at
4,043 m depth and two currently active, Razole-I and Narasapur-2; and
(i) drilling of five offshore wiidcats including two in which hole was lost at
shallow depths. This work provides substantial information on the general
structural and stratigraphic setting of the Krishna-Godavari basin. A large
number of prospects and leads (indications of prospect not yet detailed) have
been identified and two discoveries are indicated. Both are potentially
important.
1/ Indicated discovery to date in this situation.

Indicated Discoveries
6.       The deep high pressure gas pay in Cretaceous sandstones was indicated
by the blow out in Narasapur-I at 4,043 m. The reservoir was neither
identified nor tested in this well but it was believed that the well had
penetrated about 0.75 m of sandstone. This discovery is being confirmed by
the Razole-1, currently at a depth of 4,500 m preparing to test. The Razole-1
is located 13 km northeast of Narasapur-1 and encountered the high pressure
gas zone 640 m structurally high to the Narasapur-I well although at the
Cretaceous-Paleocene unconformity, the two wells are at essentially the same
structural position. Gas zones were encountered in Lower Cretaceous
sandstones between 4,269 and 4,386 m (11 m net) and in fractured and weathered
basalt between 3,365 and 3,620 m (230 m gross). The Narasapur-2 also suffered
a blowout at about 3,401 m but ONGC will continue drilling down to 4,100 m by
side-tracking. The thicknesses and characteristics of the several reservoirs
encountered are not yet known, thus firm estimates of the sizes of these finds
cannot be given. However, if the present geological interpretation is
confirmed, a very significant discovery could result.
7.       The offshore discovery G-1-1 encountered about 60 m of gross gas and
oil reservoir in probable Upper Miocene sandstone between 2,110 and 2,170 m
depth. A test at the top of this interval flowed gas at the rate of 14 MMCFD
(396,000 N mi3/d) plus 210 Bbl/d and a test in the lower Sart of the interval
flowed at the rate of 580 Bbl/d of 330 API gravity (92 m /d) plus 70 MMCFD
(2,000 N m3/d) of gas through a 1/2-inch choke. The oil flow rate is somewhat
disappointing. It could be due to relative poor reservoir characteristics or
possible formation damage caused by high mud weight required to penetrate the
abnormally pressured shale encountered before reaching the total depth
(3,213 m). Subsequently the G-1-2 was drilled 3.5 km to the northwest on the
flank of the structure. This well was terminated prematurely because of
problems maintaining position of the drillship at a depth of 2,420 m. It is
likely, although not certain, that this well penetrated the G-1-1
reservoirs. If so, the edge of the accumulation is somewhere between the
two. If it is assumed that the reservoir extends half the distance between
G-1-1 and G-1-2, then an area within a productive radius of 1.75 km, or
9.6 km2, can be assigned to the discovery. The oil portion of the reservoir
has a minimum net thickness of about 13.5 m with 20% average porosity and 60%
oil saturation (even though permeability may be low). Based on these
assumptions, the G-1 discovery can be assigned about 90 million Bbl of oil in-
place, and perhaps 20 million Bbl recoverable. If the entire structural
closure is assumed to be productive, and pressures indicate a significant oil
column below the top of the reservoir, the area of closure would approximate
24 km2 and the recoverable reserve would approach 60 million Bbi. Obviously
this accumulation will not be commercial in the water depths in which it was
encountered (263 m at the G-1-1 location) unless additional productive area or
reservoir thickness can be demonstrated. One and perhaps two more wells need
to be drilled before this decision can be made. The G-3 structure on the
inner shelf was completed recently as a dry hole at a depth of 4,010 m.
Several gas shows were encountered but produced water on test.

KRISHNA-GODAVARI PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROJECT
PROJECT COST ESTIMATE
1.       The cost estimate of the project was prepared by ONGC during
appraisal in November 1981 and updated last June 1982. The costs are
expressed in mid-1982 prices. They are based on: (i) recent bids received by
ONGC on similar works; (ii) ONGC's internal costing system; and (iii) in
certain cases (i.e. offshore drilling), contract concluded recently over a
two-three year period with contractors. Contingencies are provided as
explained below.

ONGC'S Investment Program
Background
1.       ONGC is now in the third year of the five-year plan period 1980/81-
84/85. The initial plan document (June 1980), provided for expenditures of Rs
40 billion (at 1980 prices) approximately; it was revised in August 1981 in
order to incorporate the accelerated program, and outlays were increased to Rs
47.9 billion (at 1981 prices). The production target over the plan period was
increased from 51.3 million tons of crude oil to 62.8 million tons.
2.       In March 1982, ONGC completed a 10-year conceptual planning exercise
over the period 1980/81-89/90 where two scenarios are presented: Variant I
has an annual production objective of 46.5 million tons of crude oil by
1989/90, while Variant II has an objective of 60.5 million tons in the same
year. Taking into account that ONGC's existing reserves cannot sustain a
production rate above 30 million tons per annum, both scenarios assume that
increased exploration expenditures would yield commercial discoveries which
will start producing in the second half of the 1980's.
3.       ONGC recognizes that in order to accelerate its exploration program
during the seventh plan period (1985/86-89/90), additional exploration and
development expenditures will have to be incurred already during 1983/84
through 1984/85 so that when the seventh plan begins, it will have adequate
materials and equipment, trained personnel and resources to achieve its
objectives. One should note, however, that the Government has not yet
approved ONGCs recommendations. In consultation with ONGC, it was decided
that for the purposes of the financial projections over the period 1982/83-
1987/88: (i) Variant I of ONGC's expenditures program would be adopted (with
all capital costs expressed in current prices); (ii) no new discovery would
come under production during the forecast period (a conservative assumption
since recent oil discoveries could come under production during the forecast
period); and (iii) no expenditure for the development of such discoveries
would be provided for. The investment program appears at the Appendix of this
Annex, which has also been used as an input for the financial projections
(Annex 6.1), should therefore be considered as the broad outline of an
expenditure program which could be, at relatively short notice, significantly
altered, for instance on account of reservoir studies (which would lead to
additional investments in producing areas), or commercial discoveries.
Exploration
a. Onshore
4.       The Western Region, which includes the onshore part of the Gulf of
Cambay and adjacent areas in Saurashtra and Kutch, has been fairly well
explored and recoverable oil reserves are estimated at 113.6 million tons as
of 1/1/82 (51.5 million tons as of 1/1/81). The exploration strategy adopted
here is to: (i) locate extensions of prospects already delineated; (ii)
identify subtle traps in different basement blocks on the basis of
sophisticated seismic work and geological modelling; and (iii) explore new
areas such as shoal projects in the Cambay Gulf, Kutch, Saurashtra and



_68 _                         ANNEX 5.3
Page L of 3
neighboring areas. Deeper prospects in the existing known areas are also to
be drilled. During the forecast period 1982/83-1987/88, ONGC plans to carry
out about 22,230 line-km of seismic surveys and drill 200 wells (about 490,000
meters).
5.        The Eastern Region (Assam, Nagaland, Meghalaya, etc.) is considered
very prospective. Recoverable oil reserves were estimated at 61.4 million
tons as of 1/1/82 (50.0 million tons as of 1/1/81). More than 40 prospects
identified from seismic and geological surveys are yet to be drilled. Virgin
areas such as Dansiri Valley, Naga Hills, and north bank of Brahmaputra are
planned for drilling.  14,600 line-km of seismic surveys are planned during
the forecast period, together with 156 exploratory wells (altogether
580,000 m).
6.        In the Central Region, which comprises the balance of the onshore
area, no commercial discoveries have been mades so far, but a number of
attractive prospects have been identified, including the basins of Bengal, the
Krishna-Godavari basin and Cauvery. ONGC also plans to initiate exploration
efforts in new areas (Rajasthan, Himalayan foothills, Ganga Valley) and is in
the process of acquiring modern equipment for that purpose (digital seismic
units, equipment designed for desert conditions, etc.). 47,900 line-km of
seismic surveys are now proposed in the forecast period, together with 186
exploratory wells (744,000 m).
b. Offshore
7.        Offshore exploration activities have given very encouraging results
in recent years. In 1981, a new structure known as B-57 has been discovered
south-east of the Bassein field. On the east coast, oil has been discovered
for the first time in a new structure in the Palk Straits known as PH-9.
Offshore recoverable oil reserves are estimated at 345.8 million tons as of
1/1/82 (328.3 million tons as of 1/1/81).  The objective of the exploration
program here is to complete the seismic recorLnaissance and semi-detailed
surveys of most of the promising areas, and extend the same to the continental
slope and deeper areas offshore. For this purpose, about 165,000 line-km of
seismic surveys and 219 exploratory wells (719,000 m) are proposed in the
forecast period.
Development
a. Onshore
8.   Primary production for many of the fields in the Western Region is
declining, and sophisticated secondary and tertiary recovery techniques (water
flooding, polymer injection, thermal in-situ combustion, gas injection) will
be needed to maintain production. Contracts have been signed with the USSR to
assist in work-over operations, and with Nowasco of Canada to provide advanced
technology for well stimulation, acidization and fracturing. 226 development
wells are proposed during the plan period (3 26,000 m).
9. In .the eastern Region, an accelerated production program aiming to
produce 4.1 million tons by 1985/86 is underway. 273 wells (815,000 m) are
proposed for the forecast period.

Page 3 of 3
b. Offshore
10       The accelerated offshore production program includes the further
development of Bombay High and the development of new structures such as Ratna
(R-12), Heera (B-37/38), Bombay High East and Panna (North Bassein). In
addition, the South Bassein offshore gas field will be developed. CFP
(France) has been retained for the reservoirs studies and development of
Bombay High and neighboring fields. 341 development wells (789,000 m) are
proposed during the forecast period.
Research and Development
11.      Three institutes for research and development function within ONGC;
the Institute of Petroleum Exploration (IPE) and the Institute of Drilling
Technology (IDT), both at Dehra Dun, ONGC's headquarters, and the Institute of
Reservoir Studies (IRS) at Ahmedabad. These institutes support ONGC's
activities both onshore and offshore. IPE primarily frames the exploration
strategy, reviews exploration programs, and prepares reserves estimates. IDT
aims at improving the drilling technology, and to that effect develops tools,
carries out research in indigenous development of mud chemicals and cement
additives, as well as supervising and monitoring key exploratory wells
projected for deeper targets. IRS establishes drilling plans for various
discovered fields, monitors the behavior of producing reservoirs, carries out
economic studies and investigates enhanced recovery methods.
12.      ONGC now is considering establishment of an Offshore Technology
Research Institute in Bombay, which will be active in offshore oil
exploration, development, production and transportation, as well as updating
the know-how on offshore technology, deep water techniques, etc.

INDIA
OIL AND NATURAL GAS COMMISSION
Assumptions Underlying the Financial Projections
I. Background
1.01     The financial projections are based on:  (i) ONGC's revised five-year
plan 1980-85 submitted to the Government in August 1981; (ii) the revised
budget for 1982; (iii) the budget for 1983; (iv) the accelerated program for
Bombay High Offshore development submitted to the Government in January 1981;
(v) the accelerated development program for the Eastern Region; and (vi) the
accelerated exploration program of October 1981. Appropriate physical
contingencies have been incorporated in the investment program, and investment
and operating costs include price contingencies (at an average rate of 7.5%
per annum). The forecast for 1986 is tentative, and is essentially based on
the continuation of past trends.
II. Income Statements
a. Operating Revenues
2.01     Operating Revenues are calculated on the basis of the prices
currently obtained by ONGC for crude oil, natural gas and LPG. The price of
both onshore and offshore crude oil was set at Rs 138.535 per Bbl, for 340 API
crude, on July 11, 1981, with an escalation formula for lighter crudes. The
cost of offshore crude on that basis turns out to be Rs 1,188/ton, including a
cess of Rs 100/ton and a royalty of Rs 61/ton. If the crude oil is piped to
shore, a pipeline tolling fee of Rs 50-75/ton is added to the crude oil price
(the tolling fee is based on a complex formula, taking into account the
investment cost, operating cost, the annual quantities of crude oil piped, and
a weighted rate of return to ONGC). If the crude is sent to shore by tankers,
the users pay directly the transport cost. The price of onshore crude varies
between Rs 1,181/ton and Rs 1,204/ton, depending on the quality of the crude.
2.02     The price of gas is, in the case of offshore production based on the
replacement value of naphtha, and the end-use. In the case of onshore
production, it is based on the consumer's ability to pay, and the end-use.
2.03     The price of LPG is based on the current one, i.e. Rs 1,830/ton,
although ONGC has requested an increase in this price.
2.04     Detailed calculations of revenues appear at Appendix 1 to this Annex.
Operating Expenses
2.05     Operating Costs for both the onshore and offshore operations include
salaries and wages, stores and spares, operating costs of various capital
items under leasing arrangements (supply vessels, helicopters, rigs), selling
expenses and overheads.



ANNEX 6.2
Page 2 of 3
2.06     Sales tax, Royalty and Cess are based on actual qualities of oil and
gas produced. Sales tax is only applicable for onshore production. Rates are
as follows: 4/104 for onshore crude, 11/111 for Western Region gas, and 7/107
for Eastern Region gas. Royalty is Rs 61/ton for crude oil (bucLi oiishore -lid
offshore), and 10% of the well head value for gas. Cess is equivalent to Rs
100/ton, both onshore and offshore. Detailed computations appear at
Appendix 2.
2.07     The depreciation of the tangible assets is calculated on the basis of
Income Tax regulations. However, depending on the actual use of equipment,
the depreciation is allocated to the production, development or exploration
activities.
2.08     The expenditure incurred on exploration, including the depreciation
allocated as stated above, is charged uniformly at 1/15 th of the gross
expenditure incurred year after year until the area is declared abandoned or
productive. If the area is abandoned, the balance of the amount not yet
written off is depreciation over three years beginning in the yer in which the
decision is made.  If the area is declared productive, the balance of
exploration expenditures is written off over a ten-year period beginning in
the year in which the decision is made; subsequent exploration expenditures
are written off in equal installment, during the ten-year period.  Any
subsequent exploration expenditures (i.e. beyond the ten-year period) is
charged immediately to revenues.
2.09     The cost of surveys is not capitalized and charged immediately to
revenues.
2.10     For production assets, typical depreciation rates either by reducing
balance or straight line methods, are as follows:
Pipelines and Machinery - 10%;
Platforms - 30%;
Development Wells - 10 years;
Stabilization and Processing Plants - 15%.
The depreciation schedule appears at Appendix 3 to this Annex.
2.11     The schedule of interest payments appears at Appendix 4 to this
Annex.
2.12     Income tax rate is 56.375% and is based on the following
principles:   i  until a decision is made to abandon or develop, exploration
expenditures are not deductible - following that decision, exploration
expenditures are written off over a three-year period and subsequent
expenditures are deductible immediately; and (ii) an amount equivalent to 25%
of the value of an asset being commissioned is deductible for tax purposes on
that year (investment allowance).
III. Balance Sheets
3.01     Gross Assets build-up and the corresponding depreciation schedule
appear at Appendix 3.

3.02     Long-term investments refers to ONGC's subsidiary, Hydrocarbon India
Ltd, which undertakes ventures abroad; no further investments are
contemplated.
3.03     Debtors were forecast on the basis of ONGC's current arrangements,
i.e. 21 days of sales for offshore crude, 15 days for onshore crude and 30
days for gas (both onshore and offshore).
3.04     The debt schedule appears at Appendix 4.  New borrowings were assumed
to be at 11% over five years, a reasonable assumption. The proposed IBRD Loan
is assumed to be over twenty years, including a five-year grace period, and at
an effective rate to ONGC of 10.75%.
3.05     Grants in small amounts are anticipated from the Oil Industry
Development Board (OIDB) to cover primarily research projects. No provisions
are being made to cover an increase in the amount of government equity.
IV. Sources and Applications of Funds Statement
4.01     The investment program is examined in detail in Annex 5.4.
4.02     Dividends would continue to be paid to the Government at a rate of 6%
of government equity.
