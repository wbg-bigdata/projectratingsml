MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
FOR A VOCATIONAL EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Korea for US$30.0 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be repayable in 15 years including 5 years
of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance
a vocational education project.
2.        Background.  Investment in education and training at all levels has
played a prominent part in Korea's remarkable growth over the past three
decades. Vocational education and training have contributed to this effort by
providing the skilled craftsmen which constitute the foundation of the skill
pyramid. In Korea, a distinction is made between vocational education and
vocational training although both systems produce skilled craftsmen.
Vocational training, which is carried out in 74 public and 187 private
vocational training institutes, focuses on providing craftsman training for
schocl leavers. Vocational education is undertaken in 315 public and 273
private vocational high schools (VHSs) which are part of the secondary
education system (along with general high schools) under the control of the
Ministry of Education (MOE).  VHS students continue their general education
while pursuing vocational specializations. Selected VHSs will be assisted
under the proposed project.
3.        Overall management of the VHS system is vested in MOE with local
administration being the responsibility of nine provincial and six city boards
of education (BEs). MOE allocates budgetary resources through the BEs and,
through them, also exercises control over standards in both the public and
private schools relating to equipment, teacher qualifications, curricula,
student/teacher ratios, etc. Well-established mechanisms exist within the VHS
system for the periodic review and revision of curricula and associated
changes in textbooks and equipment lists. These reviews are carried out by a
broad spectrum of experts and include inputs from industry to ensure that
curricula remain relevant to employers' needs. The fifth such review has
recently been completed and revisions are currently being implemented. These
focus on placing some additional emphasis on science and English and the
introduction of a data processing course. The overall staffing of the schools
is generally satisfactory and teachers are for the most part well-qualified
and experienced.
4.        Employment rates for VHS graduates are high--82 percent of the 1989
graduates were employed, 7 percent unemployed with the remainder entering
higher education or military service. Nevertheless, in spite of the high
level of external efficiency in the VHSs and the satisfactory situation
regarding curricula and staffing, weaknesses exist in equipment provision in
the schools. Standard equipment lists exist for each specialization taught in
the VHSs but no school has been able to achieve full equipment status; most



-     - 2-
schools average in the 40-60? range.  The range of equipment in the schools is
reasonably consistent with the curricula. The problem lies in shortages in
the numbers of equipment items. The schools have responded by tightly
scheduling the use of equipment and while this leads to efficient utilization
rates, it has also led to some loss in the quality of learning because of
crowding in the use of equipment by students. Furthermore, the recent review
of equipment which followed the curricular review, indicated that teaching
equipment in school workshops is not being modernized at a sufficient rate to
keep up with changing technology in the workplace. At earlier stages of
Korea's development, the pace of technology development was quite slow,
relying mainly on mastering relatively unsophisticated imported technology.
This allowed sufficient time for the vocation'l training system to adapt to
changes in the skill structure and training needs of the labor market.
However, as the rate of technology development has accelerated, the
sophistication of industrial equipment ha outpaced the acquisition of
comparable equipment for training purposes in the vocational high schools.
Consequently there is a need to update equipment in the schools to ensure that
they can continue to train skilled workers to the level required by industry.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The proposed project continues Bank
assistance in the field of technical and scientific training which has
encompassed six operations over the past two decades. Early lending focussed
on craftsman and technician training and then shifted its emphasis to higher
level training of engineers and scientists in line with the demands of Korea's
rapid technological development. Appropriate emphasis was also placed on
improving the policy framework for technical and scientific training.  The
Bank's operations have been consistent with the Government's priorities and
evaluation reports indicate that projects were implemented efficiently and
successfully contributed to improving the quality of technical and scientific
training and strengthening the policy framework in this field. The proposed
project is reverting to assistance to vocational training in recognition of
the need for the training system to keep pace with the demand for increasingly
complex craftsman-level skills in the labor market. Bank assistance is still
required to fill gaps in investment programs of educational institutions which
traditionally have relied on external financing to meet equipment upgrading
needs. Furthermore, the Bank's involvement in project design and appraisal
brings value-added to the Ministry of Education through helping to strengthen
its capabilities in these areas.  .he Bank brings continuity to the project
development process and has developed criteria-based procedures and
documentation which not only allow projects to be designed more efficiently,
which benefits MOE, but which may also have wider application in the future as
Korea becomes a donor supporting educational development elsewhere.
6.        Project Objectives.  The overall objective of the project is to
assist in upgrading the skill training provided in selected vocational high
schools to ensure that their graduates continue to meet the increasingly
complex skill requirements in industry, commerce, agriculture and fisheries.
The project would assist in making VHS graduates more productive upon entering
employment and better able to adjust to rapidly changing technological
processes.
7.        Project Description.  The proposed project, to be carried out over a
period of five years, would finance specialized equipment for four types of



3-       
VHS--technical, commercial, agricultural and fisheries/marine. The Government
would finance complementary inputs related to making the equipment operational
and maintaining it thereafter, namely transportation and installation costs,
O&M and consumables. The ecluipment needs of all VHSs have been surveyed.
Schools would be selected for participation in the project by the local boards
of education (BEs) according to specific criteria. Each BE would be
responsible for recommending to MOE the amount and type of equipment for each
participating school. Equipment for each school would be procured partly to
meet some of the shortfall in standard equipment items and partly for updated
equipment needed to teach more advanced technologies. The proportions would
vary according to the needs of each school. Both public and private schools
would have equal opportunities for participating in the project. Private
schools would not be required to repay loan funds but would receive such funds
as budget transfers from MOE through the BEs. The proposed loan would finance
about 955 of the estimated foreign exchange cost of the project or about 69Z
of total project cost net of duties and taxes. Overall responsibility for
project implementation would lie with the Ministry of Education with its
Education Facilities Bureau handling the detailed activities. Equipment
procurement would be undertaken by the Office of Supply, Republic of Korea in
conjunction with MOE and the BEs. It is estimated that about 852 of equipment
to be financed under the project would be procured under ICB. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Korea are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8966-KO, dated
February 15, 1991, is being distributed separately.
8.        Agreed Action.  The Government has agreed that skhools would be
selected for participation in the project according to criteria acceptable to
the Bank.
9.        Benefits.  The project would upgrade the quality of skill training
provided in the vocational high schools, enhancing the value of their
graduates to prospective employers by increasing their usefulness immediately
upon graduation and by improving their ability to adjust to technological
change in the workplace. Thus, the continued employability of vocational high
school graduates would be enhanced, and the productivity of the sectors in
which the graduates were employed would be improved.
10.       Risks.  There are no major risks associated with the project.
11.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
