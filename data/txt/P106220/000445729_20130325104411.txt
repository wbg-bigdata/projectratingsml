  F. Results Framework Analysis

  Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

         The overall objective of the Youth Development Project (YDP) was to promote youth
  empowerment and inclusion in development by expanding the capacities of, and opportunities for, youth
  groups to initiate and participate in community and local development initiatives.

  Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

         There were no changes made to the original PDO, however, the following key indicators, were
  modified at Mid-Term (October 2010): (i) percentage of targeted communities where youth feel that
  there are more opportunities for youth participation in community and local development; and (ii)
  percentage of targeted communities that report increased youth participation in local and community
  development activities. The last key indicator: "Improved Secretariat of State for Youth and Sports
  performance ratings" remained the same throughout the project life-time.

1.      Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1        Context at Appraisal

Country Context

        In 1999, the citizens of Timor-Leste voted overwhelmingly for the restoration of independence
from Indonesia. After the referendum, exiting forces inflicted a campaign of violence across the country
that resulted in widespread destruction and massive displacements of civilians. In the aftermath of this
post-independence violence, the Timorese Government made significant steps to foster reconciliation
and showed a commitment to promoting growth and reducing poverty with a focus on basic economic
and social services. Security was assured through the deployment of a UN peacekeeping mission that
focused on peace-keeping, training, and support to the Timorese police force.

        In 2006, however, Dili was again plunged into violence after a disaffected group of soldiers of
the national army (the F-FDTL) went on strike and were subsequently dismissed. In the ensuing
violence over 160,000 people were displaced and at least 2,000 houses were torched. The unrest had a
devastating impact on the economy: coffee production fell by about 20 percent and real non-oil GDP
declined by 5.8 percent in 2006.1 The deployment of a new United Nations peacekeeping mission was
necessary to assist with the restoration of security. Insecurity and periodic episodes of violence
continued well into early 2008. Improved security following the 2006 civil unrest, higher oil-financed
public spending, and a rebound in agriculture from the 2007 drought contributed to non-oil GDP growth
averaging 11 percent during 2007/09. In 2010, however, about 40 percent of the population was
estimated to still live in poverty with the 2010 Human Development Report ranking Timor-Leste at 120
out of a total of 169 countries.


Greater visibility of youth exclusion issues in Timor-Leste

        With 34 percent of the population aged between 12 and 29 years of age, and a high fertility rate
of 7.8 births per woman, meeting the needs and aspirations of young people is a medium to long term
development challenge in Timor-Leste. At the time of project preparation the potential risks of growing
youth marginalization had been brought to the forefront of policy discussions. Persistent fighting among
youth groups, gang and martial arts group violence were key manifestations of the crisis and instability
and ongoing problems at appraisal. While youth were not the instigators of the violence, they were used
as agitators and also exploited the breakdown in law and order to loot businesses and exact revenge for
past grievances.

       Analytical work supported by the World Bank on Youth at Risk in Timor-Leste (2007)2
highlighted some of the critical, underlying, issues putting young people at risk of continuing violent
behavior. The analysis stressed that youth engagement in violence was not new with both the Resistance
leadership and Indonesian authorities having encouraged or condoned violence by youth, respectively as
a form of resistance or as a means to intimidate the electorate. A complex mix of economic, social and

political factors in a context where state institutions, formal sector employment and supra-local identities
were all relatively new, meant that this risk was maintained if not exacerbated in the post-independence
period. Key risk factors were as follows: (i) high youth unemployment rates of 43 percent nationally and
up to 59 percent in the capital Dili; (ii) low educational attainment with only 1.7 percent of males and
3.4 percent of females (15 to 29 years old) having completed primary school3; (iii) low literacy rates in
the official language at Independence (Portuguese)4; and (iv) weakened social ties with communities and
traditional social control mechanisms, particularly in urban areas. This latter factor was linked to
growing membership in youth gangs often active in criminal activities, extortion and vigilantism.5

       The World Bank supported analysis looked at issues of youth exclusion holistically and
recommended a focus on bringing youth into decision-making processes at community level to foster a
closer and constructive engagement with traditional authorities and local government. It also
recommended strengthening government’s own capacity to reach out to young people and youth
organizations at the central level in order to include these groups in the overall nation-building process.


        Supporting the Government of Timor-Leste’s Stabilization Strategy

        The Youth Development Project (YDP) sought, therefore, to address key issues of youth social
exclusion and perceived alienation from the nation-building process, working simultaneously at the
community and local government levels. The project was processed under OP/BP 8.00 6 and responded
to a direct government request to operationalize its strategies for addressing the role of youth in the
2006/07 crisis.

        A new government, formed in 2007, prioritized a number of measures to stabilize Timorese
society through the National Priority Program. A National Youth Policy (NYP) was also promulgated in
2007 as part of this overall effort. It addressed a wide range of social, economic and political issues
affecting youth. The YDP constituted an important element of a more comprehensive governmental
stabilization strategy that also included support for the return and reintegration of displaced populations,
generous benefits for veterans, food price stabilization, expansion of public sector employment, and a
significant fiscal stimulus. The project was designed to include, on the one hand, activities with short-
term impacts and immediate gains for disenfranchised young people. On the other, it aimed, in the
medium term, to strengthen government capacity to work more effectively with youth and youth
organizations in order to engage them in community life and nation-building.

       The approach followed by YDP was in line with the World Development Report of 2007:
Development and the Next Generation, which highlighted the importance of broadening the
opportunities for youth and developing their capacities as decision-makers. It was also consistent with
the Country Assistance Strategy 2006/08 (CAS) which stressed the importance of addressing youth

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators


        The PDO for YDP was to promote youth empowerment and inclusion in development by
expanding the capacities and opportunities for youth groups to initiate and participate in community and
local development initiatives.

        The original key indicators were as follows7: (i) percentage change in female and male youth
from targeted communities who feel that there are more opportunities for youth participation in
community and local development; (ii) percentage change in female and male youth from targeted
communities who participate in planning and managing community development activities in urban and
rural areas; and (iii) Improved Secretariat of State for Youth and Sports (SSYS) performance ratings.8


1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification

        There were no changes to the original PDO, however, key indicators, were modified at Mid-
Term (October 2010) through the inclusion of two new indicators: (i) percentage of targeted
communities where youth feel that there are more opportunities for youth participation in community
and local development; (ii) percentage of targeted communities that report increased youth participation
in local and community development activities. The last key indicator - Improved Secretariat of State for
Youth and Sports performance ratings - was not changed. The corresponding end of project target was,
however, revised down from “Satisfactory? to “Moderately Satisfactory.? In addition, the Intermediate
Outcome Indicators were significantly modified to reflect project re-structuring. These changes are
outlined in Section F of the data-sheet (Results Framework Analysis) and in Annex 2.

        The modifications mentioned above were introduced for three key reasons. Firstly, to address the
fact that it was not possible to establish a baseline for the original indicators. The focus on “percentage
change? of respondents reporting increased opportunities for and participation in project activities was
therefore dropped. Secondly, to reflect the changes in the data collection approach adopted by the team
as additional trust fund resources expected to support quantitative data collection were not secured. The
team shifted its approach to use less costly qualitative methodologies providing an overview of youth
and community perspectives on participation. Compiling data at community level, also required that
gender disaggregated information be dropped at the Key Performance Indicator level. Gender
disaggregated information was, however, collected on participation rates in consultations for the design
of sub-projects as well as in actual sub-project implementation through the project’s Management
Information System (MIS). In addition, the Beneficiary Assessment (BA) collected qualitative
information on the perceptions of male and female youth of the opportunities for participation created at

  As outlined above there was agreement with the implementing agency to begin monitoring the revised/new indicators after
the Mid-Term Review in October 2010, although project re-structuring was completed in December 2011 (additional details
are provided in Section 3).

community level by YDP. Finally to take into account the scaling back of the project’s Component 1,
with several activities originally envisaged being dropped.


1.4 Main Beneficiaries

        At appraisal, the primary target group for YDP were young people (those between 16 to 30 years
of age in line with the NYP) in both urban and rural areas. Following project re-structuring in 2011,
YDP focused to a larger extent on rural youth though the project’s Component 2. Activities under
Component 1 (including the provision of grants to youth groups in urban areas through the planned NYF
and the provision of youth center based services) were considerably scaled back. Following project
restructuring, this latter component focused on a more modest set of capacity building targets.
(Additional analysis will be provided in sections 1.6 and 3).

         Under the revised Component 2, small grants were provided to youth groups for the
implementation of sub-projects that addressed the needs of young people in targeted villages. These sub-
projects covered a wide range of activities with a strong focus on sports and livelihoods. The project
benefitted approximately: (i) 20,000 young people (37% female, and 63% male) through participation
in decision-making meetings to determine sub-project activities and design. Of these, 13,000 young
people (38% female and 62% male) were also actively involved in the implementation of sub-project
activities. In line with YDP’s Management and Information System (MIS) approximately 17% of all
young people in targeted communities participated in sub-project implementation (against a target of
20%). The Emergency Project Paper (EPP) did not set specific targets for numbers of beneficiaries to be
reached. It instead set a target of 30% change in (male and female) youth participation in community-
level organizations. This was revised at project Mid-Term with the updated indicator setting an end of
project of 20% of youth participating in the implementation of youth development projects in targeted
communities (Please see Annex 2 for additional details).

         Activities at the village (suco) and hamlet (aldeia) level targeted the following five of Timor-
Leste’s 13 districts9: Aileu, Bobonaro, Ermera, Lautem and Manufahi. Given the challenging
institutional context in which the project was implemented, one of the team’s design choices was to
build to some extent on existing Ministry of State Administration and Territorial Management
(MSTAM) programs. YDP used the platform/structure (including staff at district level) of the existing
GoTL Local Development Project (LDP) to channel small grants for youth and community activities.
The initial selection of target districts was therefore based on the presence of LDP10. A second factor,
which was critical in the selection of target areas, was the extent to which GoTL had identified the risk
of continued violent behavior on the part of young people in certain of these LDP districts.
Consultations with MSATM, SSYS and civil society organizations on youth at risk, therefore, also
informed the final selection of target areas. While the team attempted to collect additional data on youth
violence for targeting purposes limited information was available at district level making these
consultations a critical part of the selection of target areas.

9
  The project’s initial intention was to scale-up the innovative approach piloted by YDP to all 13 districts should
implementation be successful. This will be discussed further under Section 3.1.

   The LDP had been established with the support of UNCDF and UNDP in 2004. It was active in eight districts at the time of
appraisal with a budget of US$3,000,000 planned for execution in 2008. Under LDP, local assemblies were established at the
district and sub-district level to foster community involvement in local development planning and oversight.

                                                            10
        The first districts selected for project implementation were, Bobonaro and Lautem (the most
experienced in LDP implementation), followed by Lautem, Manufahi and Ermera.11 In addition, the
project also targeted youth organizations through the support it provided to youth centers in the district
capitals of Aileu, Ermera, Oecussi and Manufahi. 12

                Finally, it is important to highlight that institutional support was extended to both SSYS
(albeit scaled back after re-structuring) and MSATM to improve: (i) their capacity to address the needs
of young people and; (ii) their ability to reach out to youth groups at central and community level.


1.5 Original Components

The project consisted of the following two Components:

Component 1: Operationalizing the National Youth Policy (US$520,000). This component was
designed to support the SSYS to operationalize the National Youth Policy by: (i) strengthening its
institutional capacity to develop, implement and coordinate policy and programs relating to its mandate,
including a unit to administer the National Youth Fund (NYF) within SSYS; and, (ii) enhancing its
ability to work with youth groups, organizations and youth centers and support youth initiatives. It
included two sub-components.

    Sub-Component A – Institutional Strengthening: to strengthen the capacity of SSYS to develop,
     implement and coordinate policy and programing relating to its mandate as identified in the NYP.
     Specifically, this component aimed to assist SSYS to implement a series of capacity building
     workshops, conduct annual progress reports of its capacity and undertake an annual expenditure
     review of the government budget allocation for youth programming (Youth Public Expenditure
     Review). In addition, it aimed to support the establishment of a unit to manage and administer the
     NYF, including: (i) technical assistance; (ii) funding for office refurbishment and equipment, and
     (iii) support for outreach and capacity building.

    Sub-Component B - Strengthening Youth Centers: providing funding to strengthen the capacity
     of SSYS to work with and coordinate the activities of youth centers. The sub-component covered
     capacity building for staff and funding for management of selected youth centers.

Component 2: Youth For Local Development (US$1.6 million). This component supported MSTAM
to establish a mechanism to distribute small grants to youth in rural villages and hamlets through the
existing LDP. The component targeted five districts with each expected to be provided with a minimum
of two cycles of funding13. The three sub-components include:



11
   Consideration was also given to achieving some degree of geographical balance between East and West regions of Timor-
Leste primarily through the inclusion of Lautem district.
12
   These were intended to demonstrate a potential Youth Center model that could be replicated by SSYS.
13
   This happened in all districts with the exception of Ermera, where sub-projects ran for one cycle only as the district was
added to the project after re-structuring in 2011.

                                                             11
   Sub-Component A – Youth Grants: providing funds earmarked for youth groups at the village
    level to identify, prioritize and implement sub-projects – such as livelihood activities, rehabilitation
    of youth centers, social events, construction of small infrastructure and life skills training. Grant
    allocations were calculated on a per-capita basis (U$1.8/person) and resulted in allocations of
    approximately US$2,200 to US$5,000 per village depending on the population. These allocations
    were based on the Local Development Program (LDP) formula and were initially adopted by the
    team for purposes of consistency.

   Sub-Component B – Youth Facilitators and Capacity Building: providing support to train and
    staff a corps of youth facilitators to guide implementation of activities at village level. The assistance
    provided included information dissemination on the project to young people, youth consultation
    meetings, and capacity building of a Youth Implementation Team (YIT) to oversee and manage sub-
    project implementation at hamlet/village level.

   Sub- Component C – Program Implementation and Technical Support: augmenting project
    implementation capacity of the Project Management Unit within MSTAM. This included outreach,
    training, administrative support staff, equipment as well as technical assistance with documentation,
    training development and Monitoring & Evaluation. The component included communication
    activities associated with project implementation and technical assistance to ensure that the use of
    the youth grants was gender inclusive.

1.6   Revised Components

      There were no changes to overall project components, although the scope of activities under
Components 1 and 2 were revised as outlined below. In particular, activities relating to the
implementation of the NYF were dropped at project re-structuring.

1.7 Other significant changes (in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements, schedule,
    and funding allocation)

        Adjustments were made to project design following the Mid-Term Review (October 2010) in
order to address: (i) delays in overall project implementation; and (ii) technical and capacity challenges
with the execution of activities under Component 1. These changes also sought to leverage the good
foundation established by MSTAM for the implementation of Component 2.

        Under Component 1, changes at SSYS senior staff level (discussed further under Section 2.2)
caused significant implementation delays and changes in ownership of key elements of this project
component. Activities relating to the operationalization of the NYF were dropped due to insufficient
capacity by SSYS to carry out the original approach during the project implementation period.
Specifically, a draft policy and outline of the corresponding operations manual for the NYF were
developed but were found to be of inadequate quality. With one year to expected project closure
(original date of December 2011), SSYS continued to experience difficulties in identifying and retaining
qualified staff that could provide adequate Technical Assistance to NYF design. In addition, the
implementation of the planned Youth Public Expenditure Review (YPER) had not yet been initiated at
Mid-Term. In light of the limited time remaining for Project implementation both activities were
dropped in the project restructuring.14 This had implications on the extent to which the project was able
to reach out to youth in urban areas and in terms of the overall sustainability of the approach.
(Additional details will be provided in Section 3).

         In parallel, activities under Component 2 were scaled-up with Youth Grants provided to an
additional district (Ermera). Changes in the operationalization of the sub-grant component were also
introduced at mid-term to address bottle-necks in implementation and ensure that grants were more
responsive to the needs of youth groups: (i) village block allocations were modified to reflect 2010
national census data; (ii) village block grant allocations were increased from $1.80 to $2.50 per person;
(iii) the maximum size of sub-projects was increased to US$5,000 and the minimum set at $800: (iv) the
minimum overall village allocation was increased from $1,000 to $2,000 and the maximum from $10,000 to
$15,000; and (v) sub-projects that only involved the purchase of goods (e.g., sport uniforms, sports
equipment) and were less than $1,500 could be disbursed in one tranche.

        In line with the changes highlighted above on the scope of Components 1 and 2, funding
allocations were also modified (Table 2) and the project closing date extended from December 31 2011
to September 30 2012.


14
  Project re-structuring was recommended by the task team following the Mid-Term Review (MTR) in October 2010 but
required lengthy discussions/negotiation with SSYS. Final re-structuring was finally processed in December 2011.

2.      Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1        Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

        Three important factors affected YPD preparation, design and quality at entry: first, YDP was an
emergency response project whose preparation took place over a short period of time with the task team
therefore focusing on essential analytical work only; second, the team sought to follow best practice
approaches in post-conflict reconstruction by addressing both short-term risks and longer capacity
challenges. Both of these factors contributed to a somewhat ambitious design subsequently simplified
during implementation. The third factor was reliance on Trust Fund (TF) resources to be mobilized for
the implementation of the project’s monitoring and evaluation strategy.

       The background analysis carried out by the team was sound and focused on the essential
elements required for project design. Project design followed best fit for operations in fragile contexts.
However, the team made some design choices for monitoring and evaluation based on anticipated TF
resources which were not secured, and this required subsequent adjustments during implementation.

       a. Short preparation time-frame

    The preparation time-frame for YDP was compressed. The fragile security situation required a rapid
intervention on the part of GoTL and therefore an equally rapid World Bank response in support of
GoTLs stabilization plan. Preparation began in March 2008 and appraisal was conducted two months
later (May 2008). While this enabled the task team to be responsive to counterpart needs it limited the
extent to which additional analysis could be carried out. In terms of quality at entry, the team made the
most of the available information and preparation time to secure critical data. The team drew on existing
analytical work carried by the World Bank on youth at risk 15and carried out short pieces of targeted
analysis. Critical pieces were initiated during preparation and the majority completed before project
effectiveness as follows:

      A capacity assessment of SSYS to inform the implementation of the NYP and related capacity
       building activities.
      A review of lessons-learned from the implementation of Youth Center (YC) programs, as well as a
       separate mapping of existing YC in Timor-Leste and the services they offered at the time of
       appraisal.

     World Bank (2007) Timor Leste’s Youth in Crisis: Situational Analysis and Policy Options

                                                              14
   A detailed fiduciary capacity assessment of the implementing agencies (MSTAM and SSYS). Based
    on the findings the team concluded that overall management of fiduciary matters should remain with
    MSTAM. This fiduciary arrangement created a requirement for operational cooperation between
    MSTAM and SSYS which added to project complexity. It was, however, the only viable operational
    alternative at the time based on the available information on implementing agency capacity.

    b. Weak institutional context and lessons-learned from other operations

         One the main challenges faced at entry by YDP was the need to factor into its design the weak
institutional context in which the project was being implemented. The initial design choices by the task
team dealt with this by following best fit/best practice approaches for post-conflict operations and
introducing a capacity building element in project design (while building on on-going programs to
generate quick wins for youth). Some of the capacity building elements of YDP were relatively
ambitious and brought a greater degree of complexity to the project.

        The situation analysis of 2007 stressed the importance of a dual strategy to address youth issues
in Timor-Leste: (i) obtaining short term gains for youth; and (ii) supporting improvements in
government’s capacity to reach out and include young people in the development process. This approach
is in line with the World Development Report on Conflict Security and Development (2011), which
highlights the role that weak institutions play in perpetuating the risk of conflict and violence in post-
conflict settings.

    The design of Component 1 required SSYS to make rapid/critical changes in a short period of time
(from 2009-2011). In particular, it required a shift from having no clear definition of functions or Terms
of Reference for core staff or key Director-level staff appointed (given the transition period for the
establishment of the new government in 2007) to developing and fully operationalizing a new grant
making mechanism (NYF). Component 1 also included the establishment of a set of effectively
managed Youth Centers, in practice creating a model that could subsequently be replicated as well as the
implementation of the Public Expenditure review of programs aimed at young people. This element of
the design required substantial efforts as outlined in the team’s initial assessment. Inherent risks in
following this approach were thoroughly discussed both within the task team, with the broader Country
Management Unit and most importantly with GoTL. The option of working solely on the outreach to
youth at community level (Component 2) was discussed and ultimately discarded primarily given strong
GoTL request for capacity building support.

        The preparation of the project’s Component 2, providing small grants to young people at suco
level, drew extensively from the existing LDP implemented by MTSAM. The task team’s analysis
focused on how community representation could be further improved in LDP and on the operational
adjustments (including additional technical assistance on the part of SSYS) required to adapt the
platform to channel grants to youth groups. This included developing a separate process for youth
socialization and project identification activities. In addition, the team reviewed options for the
coordination of technical support to sub-project preparation between YDP and LDP teams drawing on
available district level staff for technical assistance. Importantly, the initial analysis carried out also
stressed the importance of training a core of youth facilitators to oversee youth participation and monitor
project implementation at community level. Finally, the task team was also able to review an earlier
experience of using a Community Driven Development (CDD) approach in a post-conflict setting in

                                                    15
Timor-Leste. The Community Empowerment Project (CEP) supported by the World Bank from 2000 to
2003 faced significant implementation challenges in terms of quality of infrastructure and sustainability
of investments. Lessons learned from this earlier intervention reiterated the importance of using existing
systems with an established outreach structure and mechanisms for technical assistance.

      c. Basing some elements of design on Trust Fund Resources to be mobilized

    While the issue of Monitoring & Evaluation will be addressed below (Section 2.2) it is important to
mention that the initial design of the M&E strategy relied on additional Trust Fund (TF) resources to be
mobilized by the task team.16 It therefore included a strong focus on survey work (including the
collection on baseline data), which is relatively costly. Given the level of TF resources available for
GoTL through AusAID at the time of appraisal it was not unreasonable for the team to expect that
funding would be available for the proposed analysis. However, changes in the way in which AusAID
TF resources were allocated at regional level from 2010 onwards meant that WB supported interventions
in Timor-Leste were no longer eligible for support. The team subsequently adapted and simplified M&E
design, using primarily qualitative methodologies. This was a short-coming at entry which subsequently
affected implementation (Additional details are provided in Section 5).



2.2      Implementation

     YDP faced three main implementation challenges: (i) changes in SSYS staffing and further
institutional instability impacted government commitment to the implementation of Component 1; (ii) in
2010 substantial additional resources were channeled through MTSAM for a new local development
initiative straining its capacity further; and (iii) challenges in staffing key positions given high levels of
competition for human resources both in Dili and at district level.

      a. Institutional instability at SSYS level

    Changes in senior level staff at SSYS meant that the World Bank team lost its main counterpart in
the institution, which had participated actively in the preparation process. A number of key senior
positions remained vacant or in flux (with Director-level positions pending confirmation) during the first
two years of project implementation (2008 and 2009). This impacted SSYS ownership of and
commitment to the implementation of capacity building activities under Component 1, while more
fundamental managerial staffing issues were being resolved. Therefore, if core capacity building
activities with SSYS were implemented, the overall scope of Component 1 activities was significantly
reduced as the task team took stock of challenges and pace of implementation at Mid-Term. Definition
of core functions for senior staff and training programs were implemented as planned and critical
support was extended to youth centers as intended albeit at a slower pace. The more ambitious elements
of this Component: (i) the proposed YPER and; (ii) the operationalization of the NYF did not, however,
take place as initially planned, and associated resources were re-allocated to the project’s Component 2.


16
  The WB task team and GoTL agreed on a division on M&E responsibilities to take into account capacity constraints of the
implementing agencies. SSYS and MSTAM were responsible for the project’s monitoring function while the WB took
responsibility for implementing the project’s Impact Evaluation.

                                                           16
     b. Launching of a new program by MSTAM (Programa de Desenvolvimento Descentralizado)

    The weak institutional capacity identified during preparation resulted in difficulties in the
management of staff, identification, retention and effective supervision of key consultants. This can be
well exemplified by the delays in project effectiveness (declared eight months following Board
approval). The situation was, however, aggravated by the introduction of a new program at MSTAM
level.

    From 2009, GoTL efforts to accelerate the delivery of basic services and its outreach to under-served
communities generated a dramatic increase in the amounts programed in the State Budget for key
Ministries and State Secretariats (MTSAM and SSYS). A new local development program (Programa
Descentralizado de Desenvolvimento or PDD) was launched in 2010 to accelerate service provision. The
program implemented by MSATM had a budget of US$30 million in 2010 and US$44 million in 2011.
The amount of resources invested through PDD dwarfed those of YDP. Given the fragile institutional
framework and existing challenges in identifying skilled staff for program management, the
establishment of this new program resulted in changes in the overall management team at MSATM. In
particular, senior staff left YDP to lead the management and roll-out of PPD. Secondly, key financial
management and procurement staff at MSTAM responsible for fiduciary matters under YDP were also
made responsible for overseeing PDD implementation and were overwhelmed by the demands of the
new program. Thirdly, district level personnel, already thinly stretched to provide technical support to
LDP/YDP implementation were also made responsible for a growing level of technical assistance
activities at field level under PDD (including the supervision of the technical quality of sub-projects).

     The additional burden of technical supervision placed on district staff had a negative impact on the
quality of the sub-projects developed as more limited support was available to help YDP with: (i)
preparing budgets and designs; (ii) monitoring construction in the case of small infrastructure work; and
(iii) providing specialized advice and technical assistance for the implementation of livelihood activities.
A technical review of the sub-projects carried out under sub-component 2 was completed in January
2012.17 The final report, based on a review of 25 sub-projects in Aileu, Bobonaro and Lautem districts,
indicated significant challenges with the quality of the infrastructure put in place with only 20% of the
sub-projects reviewed considered to be of adequate quality. The task team systematically followed up on
the technical recommendations of the review in subsequent Implementation Support (IS) missions and
through additional technical missions providing candid feedback on the shortcomings of the technical
support provided at district level. There were, however, limitations in terms of the additional support
that could be provided for quality control in MSATM. Issues with the quality of sub-projects continued
therefore to be raised in ISR throughout the remainder of project implementation (additional details are
provided in Section 2.5).




17
  While the task team and implementing agency had intended to finalize this review earlier, the assessment was postponed
due to delays in procurement

                                                            17
   c. Limited availability of qualified human resources

   Increased public sector spending and GoTL’s focus on accelerating service delivery also resulted in
a drive to recruit an additional number of civil servants during the YDP implementation period.
Reflecting a boarder issue of limited availability of qualified human resources in Dili, positions were,
hard to fill and staff, once brought on board, was difficult to retain (please see Table 3 below). Similar
challenges affected the recruitment of staff to support the establishment and maintenance of the project’s
Management and Information System (MIS). While the project had initially planned to hire a dedicated
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Specialist it proved difficult to identify a suitable candidate and a
more junior MIS consultant was ultimately recruited. In addition, further technical support on M&E
was, therefore, provided directly by the task team.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

       Design

         YDP’s initial M&E design included the implementation of a quantitative Impact Evaluation (IE)
and of a series of thematic studies including: (i) review of infrastructure, (ii) economic cost/benefit
analysis, (iii) socialization review, (iv) gender review, and (v) review of program training and/or
facilitation. Finally, M&E design also included the introduction of qualitative methods for the study of
youth issues, such as the Participatory Ethnographic Evaluation and Research (PEER) methodology
drawing on lessons-learned from youth violence interventions supported by the WB. With the exception
of the gender and capacity building reviews, the task team expected to seek external funding for both the
thematic studies and impact evaluation.




                                                         18
        Regular monitoring of project activities was to be carried out through period capacity assessment
reports implemented by an independent consultant for capacity building of SSYS and through the
establishment of an M&E system at SSYS level for activities related to youth center usage and NYF
implementation for Component 1. A simple MIS to: (i) track progress with sub-project implementation,
(ii) participation rates by youth in sub-project design and (iii) implementation was planned for
Component 2. In addition, the M&E strategy at design included the development of a Grievance Redress
System (GRS), the implementation of community score cards to provide beneficiary perspectives on
project implementation and the establishment of partnerships with NGOs to independently monitor
project progress. The original M&E design covered all aspects of project implementation for both
project components and the development of the MIS factored in capacity limitations by MSTAM. Some
elements of this original design were ambitious, in particular the large number of thematic reviews to be
implemented for a small-scale grant with a short implementation time frame and in a weak institutional
context.

       YDP opted for a split M&E strategy based on the initial assessment of SSYS and MSTAM M&E
capacity which was considered low. Government took responsibility for the implementation of
monitoring and process evaluation and WB (in close collaboration with GoTL) for the impact evaluation
design and implementation.

           Implementation

       The scope of the IE strategy planned by the team was significantly reduced to address the lack of
complementary TF resources as outlined above. The team shifted to the use qualitative methodologies
with a detailed Beneficiary Assessment (BA) carried out in late 2012 to assess the achievement of the
PDO. The need to change IE approaches meant that baseline information could not be collected which
was factored into BA design (Please see additional details in Annex 5).

        Similarly, the lack of additional TF resulted in a reduction in the number and topics covered
through thematic studies. In order to address these shortcomings, a partnership with the Justice for the
Poor program was put in place and a youth lens included in key pieces of analysis: (i) a review of Local
Government and Community Development Initiatives in 2011; (ii) Youth Perspectives on Community
Trust and Conflict in 2010; and (iii) Trust, Authority and Decision Making also in 2010 (drawing on the
Timor-Leste Survey of Living Standards). Of the planned studies, MTSAM carried out a review of the
quality of sub-projects and, while a gender review was not carried out, gender disaggregated data was
collected on youth participation. Finally, the capacity assessment of SSYS was the third study to be
implemented as planned (implemented at project completion).18 Capacity constraints during
implementation required MTSAM and SSYS to focus on collecting essential information on project
progress in line with the Results Framework. The task team assessed the feasibility of developing a GRS
and participatory monitoring and concluded that this would not be feasible given other implementation
challenges.




18
     Both a baseline assessment (2008) and final report (2012) were produced to generate lessons-learned.

                                                               19
        A Management Information System was put in place to monitor the progress with sub-project
implementation under Component 2, which was operational at project closure. There were initial
challenges with the establishment of the system primarily due to difficulties in the recruitment of M&E
staff as outlined above but the system generated the key data to monitor project progress and take
corrective action. Given project re-structuring and the reduction of activities under Component 1, the
accompanying M&E activities (including support to the SSYS M&E unit) were also dropped.

         Utilization

        The BA provided key information to understand improvements in youth participation rates at
community level (in line with the Results Framework) and generated lessons-learned on the quality of
participation, facilitation and community mobilization processes. In spite of its limitations in terms of
sample size,19 the qualitative methodology used to collect information yielded rich and detailed
information on participation processes. When assessing project results it is important to consider this
data together with the information on participation generated by the project’s MIS for a fuller picture of
the project’s impact on youth participation.

         Overall, the evaluation strategy followed generated information at the end of project
implementation so that lessons-learned were made available for subsequent interventions by GoTL. The
results, shared with GoTL, will be particularly useful given GoTL’s focus on preparing a national
community development program in the coming years, and they highlight areas where additional
attention may be needed to facilitate youth and community participation. Given the innovative nature of
the grant, implementing a process assessment or conducting shorter reviews of implementation quality
might have been helpful to complement Implementation Support (IS) and inform corrective action by
SSYS and MSATM as needed on the different project components.

        MIS for Component 2: While capacity to create new data queries was not established at MSTAM
level, database maintenance and the production of progress reports was regularly carried out. Data was
collected on the number and types of sub-projects and the profile of young people participating in
community meetings and sub-project implementation. Candid and timely feedback was provided to the
implementing agencies on the basis of the data collected particularly: (i) regarding the need to accelerate
progress in selected sub-districts; (ii) the timely identification of potential problem sub-projects. The
transfer of the M&E specialist to MSTAM as a civil servant at project closure is likely to result in
greater sustainability of the current system.


2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

       Project compliance with safeguards requirements was overall satisfactory. YDP triggered OP
4.01 and an Environmental and Social Management Framework was developed to guide project
implementation. While sub-projects were overall constructed in public land, minor issues were noted
with the documentation at district level of Voluntary Land Donations (VLD). These were found not to


19
   Data was collected from six treatment and four control villages for the Beneficiary Assessment (i.e ten of 192 project
sites).

                                                              20
be significant and were satisfactorily addressed through: (i) sharing of templates for VLD with district
staff; and (ii) additional training of MSATM to improve recording.

        Financial Management: The recipient complied with the financial management (FM) conditions
outlined in all of the financing agreements and satisfied the Bank's requirements under OP/BP 10.02.
Following the initial FM assessment, the FM risk was rated as “Substantial? even after mitigating
strategies to address these risks. The project only adopted the use of country systems in two FM areas:
project planning/budgeting and external auditing. The full use of country systems for accounting,
internal controls, internal audit, treasury, and reporting were not adopted due to a combination of
deficiencies identified in the FM assessment as well as the recipient’s preferences.

         There were significant shortcomings with financial management observed from the onset during
project implementation and financial management performance was frequently rated as “Unsatisfactory"
throughout the life of the project. Implementation Support Missions reported systematically on delays
with audit reports and Interim Unaudited Financial Reports (IFRs), not in compliance with the Financing
Agreement. Critical issues recurrently outlined in FM reviews were: (i) inadequate cash book format;
(ii) issues of internal controls at the national and district level; (iii) reconciliation of expenditures; and
(iv) unreliable accounting with no assurance that all the transferred funds reported as expenditures were
documented. Implementation support and technical assistance provided by the team consisted of
additional training and temporary mobilization of short-term consultants to address FM issues. In
addition, disbursements under Component 2 were temporarily suspended in 2009 based on FM review
findings. Implementation support provided follow-up on problem sub-projects. In the exceptional cases
where a satisfactory resolution was not reached by MSATM, these were cancelled/ and expenditures
considered ineligible.

        As at December 2012, all required audits of the project’s financial statements were received,
although none of them were received by the due date. All audit opinions were unqualified and all audits
were accepted by the World Bank. However, the implementing agency (MTSAM) did not address most
of the findings and recommendations of the auditors in the management letters, with the same issues
therefore being raised each year. In addition, with the exception of the first year audit, there was no
implementing agency response to these audit recommendations. This lack of action resulted in continued
shortcomings with FM and contributed to the frequent “Unsatisfactory? ratings. The final audit of the
projects’ financial statements for the year 2012 will be on June 30 2013. The client has been reminded
of their obligation to submit this final audit.20

        Procurement: Delays with procurement occurred systematically during project implementation
and had a negative impact on overall project performance. Implementation support reviews indicated
that procurement procedures were not well understood. To a large extent these difficulties can be
attributed to the lack of dedicated project staff for procurement during significant periods of time (as
outlined in Section 2.2 above). The Project Coordinator (PC) for Component 2 temporarily took over the
task of preparing and processing procurement documentation. In view of his overall role, it was not
possible for the PC to effectively attend to procurement activities. Lack of dedicated staff/staff turn-over
also limited the usefulness of the training and technical advice provided by the WB team. Recruitment

20
  As at December 2012, all required quarterly interim unaudited financial reports (IFRs) were received, only two IFRs
having been received by the due date. An IFR for period ended 31 December 2012 was due by 15 February 2013 (and had
not yet been received at the time of writing). The client has been reminded of their obligation to submit this final IFR.

                                                            21
of temporary staff to support the coordination team, additional training provided by WB team resulted in
improved procurement performance. The importance of dedicated staff for procurement functions and of
intensive and regular training is a key lesson-learned in YDP. Weak institutional capacity and in
particular difficulties on the part of the project coordination team to reach out and communicate with
staff at district level required an adaptation of the usual WB model for FM and procurement supervision
with more regular “hands-on?/on-the job follow up and training needed by counterparts.


2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

   The ICR mission reviewed transition and follow-up arrangements for capacity building activities
implemented with SSYS and for sub-project investments implemented with MSATM as follows:

a. Capacity building activities with SSYS have been effective in establishing standard roles and
   functions for senior staff. This improvement in basic management systems has helped to build a
   foundation for follow-up activities between SSYS and other development partners. While the
   operationalization of NYF was dropped from YDP following project re-structuring, SSYS is
   currently in discussions with UNICEF and GIZ to revive the fund. A draft Youth Policy is currently
   under development and is expected to be finalized in the coming year with UNICEF support. In
   addition, support for the development of the NYF operational framework and additional capacity
   building activities is being discussed as part of a partnership with GIZ. SSYS intends to further
   improve the coordination of the external support received from bi-lateral and multi-lateral partners
   and seek/develop additional partnerships.

b. Sustainability of Youth Center21 Activities supported by SSYS: Capacity building activities for
   Youth Center Management Committees (YCMC) were highly valued by participants 22 and had a
   positive impact in supporting the development of follow-up activities. Regular funding by SSYS
   continues to be provided to cover the centers’ administrative costs (US$500/month). The amount is
   often received with significant delays and is considered insufficient to cover all basic expenses.
   Costs associated with the purchase of fuel for generators and maintenance of equipment (both
   computers and generators provided through YDP) are supported by external partnerships where they
   exist. Where these are not in place or have a limited scope (Ermera and Aileu) there are no
   alternative maintenance arrangements, which significantly limits the centers’ activities. Difficulties
   with the repair of IT equipment were highlighted by YCMC in all sites due to lack of qualified
   personnel/firms that can do these repairs at district level.




21
   The initial mapping of Youth Centers carried out by the Task Team in 2008 indicated that there were approximately 50
youth centers nationwide.
22
   Focus Group Discussions carried out with YCMC members during the ICR Mission in Aileu, Ermera, Same and phone
interview with YCMC Manager for Oecussi.

                                                            22
     There is a wide variation in the types of programs implemented by the Youth Centers 23. All organize
     small-scale language and computer training courses for youth in the district capitals. In addition, the
     centers are used as a resource to identify beneficiaries of life-skills (UNICEF) or health programs
     (Mary Stopes International). More ambitious follow-up activities were implemented in Same where
     the youth center has established strong partnerships with a range of organizations present at district
     level. Outreach activities by youth centers at district level tend, therefore, to depend on the
     resourcefulness of specific YCMC and follow the particular needs assessments carried by different
     donors (and address specific sectors/issues/concerns). A comprehensive plan of activities that
     addresses the overall needs of young people (covering a broader set of issues, or issues that are not
     necessarily dealt with by development partners) is not currently in place given the limited core
     funding provided by SSYS.

c. Proposed expansion of the CDD platform with AusAID support: While no further youth-oriented
   WB operations are planned in Timor-Leste after YDP, MSATM is currently designing a national
   CDD program with AusAID support (Programa Nacional de Desenvolvimento do Suco). The YDP
   has helped to reopen the dialogue with GoTL on the potential use of CDD approaches to accelerate
   service provision in underserved areas, and to demonstrate associated opportunities and challenges.
   Specifically, YDP demonstrated the usefulness and feasibility of such as an approach following the
   challenges with the implementation of CDD programs in the early 2000’s (in particular, with CEP).
   The WB will continue to engage in these policy discussions and may provide analytical and advisory
   support to the new program. On an operational level, a better understanding of institutional capacity
   challenges and important lessons learned on community participation are now available through
   YDP to inform the design of the new operation. As MSATM moves forward with the establishment
   of the CDD platform and the basic implementation structure is established the World Bank team
   may wish to engage with MSATM and AusAID on the potential inclusion of a youth focus (or a
   possible dedicated program window for youth) once the program is more mature. The estimated
   value of the Programa Nacional de Desenvolvimento do Suco (PNDS) is US$230 million, of which
   AusAID may contribute up to US$30 million. This reflects a progressive shift away from individual
   donor funded/externally supported projects and towards support by development partners to
   establishing GoTL funded programs (drawing on existing resources from the national budget).

d. Operation/Maintenance and Sustainability of YDP sub-projects: Implementation Support Missions
   (ISMs) provided systematic advice on the technical assistance support required to improve the
   quality of sub-project construction and livelihood activities. Based on supervision findings, certain
   types of activities and purchase of equipment were excluded because they risked duplicating
   programs being rolled out by SSYS (such as the purchase of musical instruments for youth groups)
   or were considered unsustainable (such as the purchase of computer equipment in areas with no
   reliable access to the electricity network). The sustainability of livelihood sub-projects was the focus
   of particular attention during ISMs as these interventions required specialized technical support on
   market and value chain analysis not available at MSATM level. The ISR, BA assessment and the
   ICR mission all highlighted challenges with: (i) quality of construction with isolated cases on
   incomplete projects due to difficulties on the part of youth groups to effectively budget sub-project
   proposals; (ii) issues with maintenance of equipment and lack of viable business plans for

23
  It is also important to note that YCMC members are volunteers which limits to some extent the type of activities they can
engage in and results in a high degree of turn-over in some of the centers (Aileu in particular).

                                                             23
       livelihoods projects; (iii) use of sporting grounds where volley balls and nets were no longer
       available or were built in inadequate locations; (iv) or of youth centers which were found to be too
       small for the needs of youth groups for example.

       In spite of these issues with sub-project sustainability, which reflect the challenging implementation
       context of YDP, ISMs and ICR missions as well as the BA conducted at project closure highlighted
       the significant gains achieved by YDP in terms of youth participation in community life.
       Importantly, data collected during the BA indicated that participating youth considered that the skills
       gained through YDP can be employed in future development projects in their villages.


3.      Assessment of Outcomes


3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

           Objectives

        As outlined in Section 1.1 YDP was developed in the aftermath of violent clashes in 2006, which
brought to the fore key issues of youth marginalization and social exclusion. The key themes raised by
the 2007 Youth in Crisis Situation Analysis extensively used for YDP design and the operation’s overall
objective remained relevant throughout project implementation as well as in the current context. It is
important to note violence on a scale comparable to that of the 2006/7 crisis did not recur.

        Nevertheless, analytical work 24 on violence in Timor-Leste documented instances of communal
conflict in rural areas as well as episodic violence in a number of Dili neighborhoods and persistent
community concerns regarding security during project implementation. Youth continue to play a
significant role in these violent incidents. A range of factors contributed to persistent insecurity
throughout the project implementation period among which: (i) tensions between host and internally
displaced communities; and (ii) competition over resources in the context of decentralization.
Importantly, the analysis also pointed to the influx into Dili of rural youth looking for employment as an
important destabilizing factor. Expectations of finding employment in the city are primarily motivated
by a construction boom and commercial development. This latter finding supports earlier analysis on
youth and employment25 carried out by the World Bank team and highlighted medium to long term
challenges in this area. In particular, concerns raised regarding the aspirations of new job seekers who
aim to move away from traditional occupations such as agriculture are particular pertinent. Young
people face substantial challenges with large number of youth still reaching adulthood with no education
(estimated to be 20% in 2007). This is compounded by the limited absorptive capacity of a slow growing
private sector.

Design


        YDP design remained relevant throughout the project life-span with solid GoTL ownership of
the project’s approach to reaching young people through community-based interventions. However,
government’s initial focus on addressing issues of youth at risk (as part of its stabilization strategy),
gave progressively way to an increased emphasis in GoTL policy on youth employment and on overall
basic service delivery to under-served areas. The 2006-2008 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was
built around the Government’s first National Development Plan. Youth considerations were
mainstreamed across its three strategic pillars: (i) Delivering Sustainable Services; (ii) Creating
Productive Employment, and (iii) Strengthening Governance. Lessons learned from CAS
implementation indicated that this mainstreaming approach may have contributed to less focused
attention to youth priorities. A shift in strategy to address youth concerns was therefore adopted in the
new Interim Strategy Note (2010-2011), with dedicated activities, including a growing focus on youth
employment planned under Strategic Area 3: “Support for Short-Term Stabilization.?26 This followed
GoTL’s own shift in emphasis in its approach to youth with a stronger focus towards youth employment
once the initial stabilization phase following the 2007 violence was over. YDP focused primarily on
bridging the gap between government authorities and traditional leadership on the one hand, and young
people on the other. The new ISN acknowledged YDP’s contribution to youth inclusion through
participation in local development activities. Its strategy for engagement with youth, however, placed
greater emphasis on addressing issues of youth employment.

         Implementation

        The project remained relevant to country priorities throughout its implementation period and in
line with GoTL stabilization plan and subsequent government program. YDP outcomes in terms of
youth participation and youth inclusion in the nation-building process continue to be relevant in a
context where the new Government Program (GP) (2012-2017) places renewed importance on: (i)
accelerating service provision to under-served areas using the decentralization platform with strong
participation by youth; and on (ii) employment generation and skills training for youth. In particular, the
GP reintroduces the focus on the operationalization of the National Youth Fund and of Government
outreach to Youth Association as a means to complement the focus on employment and education. It
explicitly highlights the risk of perceived exclusion on the part of youth: “[…] our young people are
aware of the opportunities in the world and many feel they are missing out on these opportunities.?27

       However, going forward, and following the initial stabilization phase as outlined above, GoTL’s
approach progressively shifted away from dedicated community-based interventions aimed at youth and
towards the development of a broader National CDD platform targeting communities overall. It is not
expected that operations similar to YDP will be implemented in the near future by GoTL. Lessons-
learned from its implementation are none the less important for the development of the proposed PNDS.
YDP results and challenges in implementation have highlighted key capacity constraints that have to be

   The strategic areas of the 2010-2011 ISN are: (i) Strategic Area 1: Support for the Formulation of a National Development
Strategy; (ii) Strategic Area 2: The Development of Capacity to Implement the National Economic Strategy; (iii) Strategic
Area 3: Support for Short-Term Social Stabilization; and (iv) Strategic Area 4: Towards the Next CAS: Deepening the
Foundations for Non-Oil Growth.

taken into account when establishing such community-driven programs and the importance of
developing a solid implementation structure (staffing, M&E, FM and procurement management). It also
highlights the on-going importance of reaching out to young people and addressing youth exclusion
issues. A dedicated youth intervention in rural areas, however, is not likely to be the preferred approach
of GoTL going forward. Government focus is expected to be on a CDD operation with overall outreach
to communities.


3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

        The overall objective of YDP was to promote youth empowerment and inclusion in development
by expanding the capacities of and opportunities for youth groups to initiate and participate in
community and local development initiatives. The project partly achieved its PDO with some
shortcomings for the promotion of youth empowerment and inclusion at community level and limited
progress made in empowerment and inclusion through the outreach of central government institutions.
(Please see Annex 2 for an overview of key indicators). Given the PDO formulation, which focuses on
issues of empowerment and inclusion in general terms, the assessment of project achievements
presented below is based on an analysis of its two components, also relying on the available data for the
project’s Key Performance Indicators and Intermediate Result Indicators.

               Mixed results towards the achievement of the PDO

         When considering the extent to which YDP’s PDO was achieved it is important to assess two
complementary elements of the project’s objective to promote youth empowerment and inclusion. On
the one hand, the project aimed to generate improvements in GoTL’s ability to reach out to youth and
youth associations and thus address issues of youth exclusion in the overall nation-building process
(Component 1). This was intended to be achieved through the establishment of a more effective central
institution (SSYS), and a network of functioning youth centers based on the model developed under
YDP. The other element of the project’s objective was to empower young people to participate in
community level activities (Component 2). In this regard, the project aimed to create opportunities for
youth inclusion and empowerment at the community level. By providing grants to youth groups at
village level, the project aimed to enable youth to discuss their own priorities with community leaders,
decide on the key activities they would like to see implemented and manage their execution (Component
2). Through this process, the project sought to bridge the gap between traditional leaders/authorities and
young people. Both elements aimed to reduce the risk of further violent behavior by young people and
contribute to the Government’s overall stabilization program. Reviewing available MIS data, key issues
raised during supervision and the main findings of the ICR mission, available information has shown
mixed results towards the achievement of the PDO with Component 2 being the more successful
element of the project.

        The scope of Component 1 was significantly reduced at MTR with: (i) the operationalization of
the NYF being dropped; and (ii) the scope of SSYS capacity building and technical assistance being
reduced. The NYF was intended by GoTL to build the capacity of a broad set of youth groups through
the provision of small grants. In that regard, it constituted an important element of YDP’s sustainability
strategy and addressed the “supply-side? of the youth inclusion objective by creating a mechanism for
central government outreach. As outlined above, weak capacity and institutional instability at SSYS

                                                   26
level meant that institutional strengthening could not be carried out as planned. In addition, with
improvements in the overall security situation in 2008 and 2009, GoTL’s focus shifted to issues of youth
employment and service delivery.28 This may have contributed to less attention/priority being given by
SSYS to NYF key tasks under YDP.

        Therefore, while core capacity building activities were undertaken under Component 1 there
were some significant limitations to their overall impact. In summary, the findings of the final Capacity
Building Progress Review report29 indicated good progress in establishing key job descriptions and
terms of reference for SSYS staff and in the implementation of leadership and management training
(albeit through a limited number of sessions). The assessment, however, indicated the following
important shortcomings in institutional capacity development: (i) the lack of systematic support for
youth centers; and (ii) limited progress on improving data collection and overall management practices.
These issues are reiterated in the ISR ratings and periodic assessments of institutional capacity
development carried out during ISMs.

        Regarding Component 2, notwithstanding limitations with the sample size of the independent
BA already highlighted, data collected indicates that YDP has had a positive impact on both: (i)
generating increased opportunities for youth participation at community level; and (ii) ensuring that
young people can effectively take advantage of these opportunities. Importantly, the data indicates that:
(i) YDP had a positive impact in reducing the risk of violence in target areas; and (ii) that it resulted in a
productive dialogue being established between young people and traditional authorities. As YDP was
embedded within MSATM and used LDP as the vehicle for project implementation, it contributed to
setting the village leadership in a position to initiate and mediate project activities. The youth
interviewed also acknowledged this and explicitly stated that they would participate if called upon by
the village leadership. BA findings highlight that YDP reduced the distance between the state and local
youth, particularly those in rural areas for whom the state is generally very distant. Additionally, while
most assessment participants across treatment and control groups placed a high priority on youth
development, participants in YDP locations were more aware of national development agenda.

         Feedback provided by YDP participants through the BA highlighted some difficulties on the part
of youth groups to effectively manage sub-project implementation. For the vast majority this was the
first time they were given this opportunity and responsibility, which was very valued. Training was in
some instances considered insufficient to manage the more complex aspects of project implementation
(in particular financial management).30 Finally, there were important challenges with the implementation
of capacity building activities planned for MSTAM. As highlighted in Section 2.2 above, the
introduction of the PDD shifted MSTAM management attention away from YDP. Significant staff turn-
over and difficulties in retaining staff in key positions, including that of PC, are likely to limit the extent
to which lessons-learned from YDP may be introduced and followed-up in other MSTAM programs.

implementation period.

   While important support was sought and provided by village leadership, young people interviewed through the BA
describe this support as occasionally “over-bearing.?

                                                            27
        Overall, targets for intermediate project outcomes under Component 2, regarding youth
participation during the design and implementation of sub-projects, were met (with achievements being
only marginally less than end of project target in terms of youth participation). Additional analysis on
each of the project components is provided under Annex 2.


3.3 Efficiency

         The nature of this project, which focused primarily on promoting youth empowerment through
participation in community level activities, (as well as the compressed preparation time-frame), meant
that no economic analysis was initially conducted. The team intended to collect information on the
project’s economic impact using TF resources to be mobilized. These were, however, not secured and
remaining supervision funding was required for other priority activities. Specifically The team chose to
use its limited resources to collect data on youth participation as the key measure of the project’s impact
given its focus on youth inclusion.

        In addition, YDP was a very innovative intervention in the context of Timor-Leste, with its focus
on promoting youth participation through a CDD approach and using community sub-projects to: (i)
build the capacity of young people; and (ii) improve linkages between youth and traditional authorities.
While there are other interventions in Timor-Leste that focus on youth employment at the village level
there are no other comparable programs that would allow an appropriate comparative cost-effectiveness
analysis.

         Finally, the team considered comparing the cost of reaching out to youth using a community-
based approach with that of conducting similar types of interventions through Youth Center-based
activities. However, given the currently limited SSYS capacity to collect and process data on youth
center usage, such analysis (that might provide insights/information on whether using existing MTSAM
structures and a network of community facilitators might prove more/less cost-effective than building a
network of youth centers to conduct outreach activities at district level) was not possible.

      Based on the currently available information it is, therefore, not possible to assess the efficiency
of YDP.


3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

        Project objectives remained relevant throughout implementation and in the current context in
Timor-Leste. The project was aligned with the earlier GoTL stabilization plan and continues to be in line
with the new Government Program (2012-2017) and the World Bank’s new ISN, which focuses
specifically on the importance of addressing youth expectations for social stability. However, GoTL’s
increasing focus on youth employment and basic service delivery, following the improvement in the
overall security situation meant that the YDP experience is unlikely to be scaled-up by MSATM as

                                                    28
envisaged at appraisal. Lessons learned from project implementation have played a critical role in
informing planned PNDS. At the time of writing it is, however, still unclear whether the new program
will include a dedicated youth window once basic systems are well established.

        In terms of Component 1, the project put in place basic systems and functions at SSYS level and
contributed to a greater management capacity on the part of YCMCs. Nevertheless the ability on the part
of SSYS to extend the reach of collaboration with youth for development interventions was significantly
limited: (i) in terms of the level and quality of the support provided to YCMCs; and (ii) the development
of a functioning performance management system. In addition, as outlined above, the NYF support was
dropped after the MTR to take into account changing SSYS priorities and capacity constraints. The
absence of a GoTL mechanism for the continued delivery of small grants to youth significantly reduces
the sustainability of YDP gains.

        The project’s Component 2 focused primarily on creating opportunities for youth participation in
local development. When assessing the outcomes achieved by the project under this Component it is
important to take into account that the M&E strategy adopted by the team allowed information to be
collected only from a small fraction of the villages targeted by the project (six of 192 project villages).
While this makes it difficult to determine whether the results observed in terms of improved
participation in these sites are representative of overall project gains, MIS data on youth participation
strongly supports the positive findings of the BA (Additional details are provided in Annexes 2 and 5).

         There were some important shortcomings in the achievement of project objectives under
Component 2. While the project generated strong levels of youth participation there were challenges
observed in terms of sub-project quality. Livelihood sub-projects, IT training activities and sporting
activities (making up 61% of overall sub-projects) were found to be of uneven quality. This is likely to
have an impact on future opportunities for youth participation. For example, where suco youth centers
built were of poor construction quality, or too small for the needs of youth in the village, a negative
impact is likely to also be felt in terms of youth participation in further activities that might have been
carried out at these centers. Similarly, the lack of business plans for livelihood activities is likely to limit
their “viability? and therefore the sustainability of youth participation. Secondly, as outlined by the BA,
youth groups were established at community level for the purposes of the project implementation. These
groups have only a temporary character linked to the project cycle and are unlikely to pursue further
activities without additional external support. In addition, all Y-CIC members interviewed through the
BA found that they would have benefitted from additional training throughout project implementation.
Most youth were not skilled enough to undertake the actual construction of the projects they had
proposed (typically sports fields) by themselves and were restricted to the role of unskilled labor on the
projects. Finally, staff turn-over at MSTAM level and the shift in management attention to PDD
implementation is likely to limit the extent to which lessons-learned on youth inclusion and
empowerment may be taken forward as part of future CDD or local development interventions.

       Based on the analysis above, the project’s overall objective was met with some significant
shortcomings, particularly in terms of sustainability of outcomes.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a)     Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

            The BA yielded important insights on how the benefits from YDP were “distributed? among
young people in the community. First, regarding the gender dimension of participation, in the absence of
specific targets for female participation in YDP activities the majority of young people engaged in Y-
CIC in treatment areas were men. Where women were involved they tended to work as treasurers for the
group. The BA analysis highlighted that the project, overall, worked with established gender roles.
Secondly, and as noted in CDD interventions globally, the benefits of participation (in terms of
awareness raising, training, “empowerment’) were primarily gained by the group of volunteers directly
engaged in sub-project management (Y-CIC). The BA further noted a common trend across treatment
sites with more educated youth selected for Y-CIC positions. However, the assessment found no
instances where specific groups were explicitly prevented from participation. Rather, the Y-CICs tended
to comprise members from different previous youth groups, including the Martial Arts Gangs (MAG),
but were not exclusive along those lines. No cases where encountered where the YDP had led to
increased levels of conflicts or violence among youth.

(b)     Institutional Change/Strengthening

       As outlined above, the project explicitly sought to build institutional capacity for the
implementation of the NYP, with modest results. Details on key achievements and shortcoming are
provided in Section 3.2 above.


(c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts

N/A


3.6    Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey (please see Annex 6 for additional details)

        A Beneficiary Assessment was implemented under the guidance of the World Bank team at
project closure between September and October 2012. The BA focused on the following four themes: (i)
Participation and Development Priorities; (ii) Empowerment and State-Society Relations; (iii) Youth
Group Formation and Dynamics; and (iv) Youth Employment. It used qualitative research
methodologies (in particular Focus Group Discussions31 and Key Informant Interviews). Information
was used to collect information from six treatment32 and four control communities.



31
   Focus Group Discussions were held with eight young people in each site (a mix of youth/participants/non-participants and
other community members)
32
   Treatment areas were Tohumeta, Fahiria, Fatubosa in Aileu and Holsa, Sanirin, Rairobo in Bobonaro while control
communities were Maubisse and Liurai in Ainaro and Sau and Lakumesak in Manatutu.

                                                            30
        Participating youth in the YDP villages showed a stronger understanding of the state, and of the
way the state implements local development interventions, than youth from non-YDP villages. Youth
(and others) in YDP villages were overall satisfied with YDP sub-projects, though some criticisms did
arise, such as the perceived low budget allocation leading to uncompleted projects. The impact of YDP
was particularly noticeable in more remote areas. YDP opened up opportunities for youth to genuinely
participate in local development (i.e not offered by other government or non-government programs) in
spite of the strong influence of traditional leaders. This was recognized and appreciated by both youth
and the broader community during the BA.


4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome


Rating: Substantial

        Regarding Component 1, gains in terms of SSYS capacity building were considered fairly new
and easily reversible in the final capacity assessment conducted. With growing development partner
interest in institutional capacity building activities with SSYS (particularly on the operationalization the
National Youth Policy and the National Youth Fund where both UNICEF and GIZ are currently active)
some of the YDP gains may be consolidated. This will require that SSYS play a stronger coordination
role to avoid duplication of efforts.

        Regarding Component 2, there are significant issues with uneven quality and sustainability of
sub-project investments, which are likely to have an impact on future opportunities for youth
participation as outlined in section 3.3 above. In addition, there are no other interventions currently
ongoing or planned that focus on youth empowerment at community level. There is a significant risk
that training and structures put in place by YDP do not lead youth to a sustained engagement in
community life and/or with local government. This risk may be to some extent off-set by the future
development of the PNDS. , which could potentially integrate a specific youth inclusion dimension.
Maintaining dialogue on youth concerns at the level of the Timor-Leste WB country office and in the
dialogue with key development partners with a strong in-country presence will be key.

5.    Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

    In spite of a very compressed preparation time-frame, the task team was able to draw on in depth
analysis of the key issues affecting youth in Timor-Leste, carry out consultations with key stakeholders
and ensure that targeted pieces of analysis (in particular a capacity assessment of SSYS) were completed
before project effectiveness. In addition to this analytical base, the WB was also able to incorporate in
YDP design key lessons learned from earlier CDD and community-based program implementation. The
design choice of using the existing LDP platform for the implementation of community/youth sub-
project was particularly successful. However, as outlined above, the team may have somewhat

                                                    31
overestimated SSYS institutional capacity for the implementation of Component 1 resulting in an
ambitious design. In addition, the Monitoring and Evaluation plan put in place did not fully take into
account capacity constraints and relied on TF resources to be for its implementation.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

    Given the challenging implementation context and the high risk rating at appraisal the WB rightly
identified the need for substantial resources to be allocated to project supervision. Periodic technical
missions were carried out to complement semi-annual supervision missions. Key issues and
implementation bottlenecks were systematically highlighted and clearly communicated to the
implementing agency and to WB management via ISRs. There was thorough follow-up on agreements
made, WB team recommendations and proposed next steps.

    Importantly, the composition of the technical staff (core team members) remained the same
throughout project implementation thus ensuring a high degree of continuity and consistency in follow-
up. Issues with the quality of investments, challenges with participation and training of field level staff
were systematically discussed with the implementing agencies using available MIS data, ISM findings
and the findings of short pieces of analysis (including a quality review of sub-project investments).
Some of the key concerns raised by the team were: (i) low capacity of the technical officers, and the
quality basic designs produced by the Verification and Appraisal Teams; and (ii) highly variable
capacity of youth groups to implement infrastructure sub-projects; (iii) need for greater number of
technical staff and improved advice on construction techniques to be provided to the Y-CICs. The World
Bank team also dealt with M&E challenges by finding alternative solutions to the impact evaluation
strategy initially proposed by: (i) adopting a lighter touch qualitative approach; and (ii) conducting
targeted analysis on youth participation and local governance through a partnership with the Justice for
the Poor Program, and (iii) strengthening the Project’s MIS. While these may not have generated
statistically representative data on participation rates in project sites they generated extremely
useful/insightful information for project implementation.

        There were, however, some limitations to the overall supervision model adopted largely due to
changes in the availability of TF resources for Timor-Leste and staff-turn over at WB Country Office
level. The plans made for implementation support at design took into account existing staff at Country
Office level. In-country-staff33 was expected to play an important role in overall supervision on the
technical elements of project implementation. Subsequent staff turn-over, the non-replacement of these
positions posed some challenges for supervision. Reduction in TF availability had an impact in the
World Bank Timor-Leste program more broadly. In the specific case of YDP, limited TF resources and
the small size of the grant (and associated supervision budget) limited the options available to the team
to provided technical assistance. Resources were not sufficient to mobilize qualified short-term
consultants to provide in-country follow-up.
   In particular, the lack of experienced in-country FM staff that could provide ‘just-in-time? support
was a shortcoming of World Bank supervision. Importantly, there was no Timor-Leste based

33
  In particular, a Trust Funded Youth Officer Extended Term Consultant expected to provide daily support to project
operations.

                                                            32
procurement staff that could support YDP before January 2012. In addition, with FM and procurement
support provided through the Sydney office and FM staff turn-over at the Timor-Leste Country Office
level there were some delays experienced in responding to the implementing agencies’ requests for FM
advice as well as in providing NoL to procurement packages. During the project life-time the task team
worked with three different procurement specialists and three different FM specialists. This affected the
continuity of support provided to the implementing agency. In the Timor-Leste context where
institutional capacity is limited this significantly constrained the team’s ability to identify potential
challenges early on and work more directly with counterparts on identifying solutions.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

       The Bank's performance was moderately satisfactory overall, during project identification,
preparation and implementation stages. Information gathered during preparation was effectively
incorporated into project design. Initial design choices, however, resulted in a relatively complex design
and M&E strategy that posed some difficulties for project implementation. While solid technical
supervision was provided there were shortcomings with the support provided, particularly on FM and
procurement.

5.2 Borrower Performance

   (a) Government performance

   Moderately Satisfactory

    While dialogue with Government remained extremely productive throughout project implementation
significant changes in the ownership of the YDP approach throughout the project life-span. With the loss
of key staff at SSYS and MTSAM (in the latter case diverted to other GoTL priorities) there were no
alternative arrangements made to address important capacity gaps. Importantly, while challenges with
the implementation of Component 1 were highlighted at project Mid-Term in October 2010, there was
some reluctance on the part of GoTL to proceed with the proposed changes. This resulted in a delay in
project re-structuring which was finally completed only in December 2011.

   (b) Implementing agency performance

   Moderately Unsatisfactory

    In spite of fragile institutional context and capacity challenges at both SSYS and MSATM level,
implementing agencies were able to overcome significant operational constraints to implement and
monitor YDP. Significant management shortcomings were, however, noted throughout the project’s life-
span. Implementation Support Reports (ISRs) systematically highlighted delays in decision-making
regarding the hiring and selection of staff and in taking corrective action to the FM and procurement
issues emphasized by the WB team. As noted in the fiduciary compliance section both audits and IFR
were frequently late.


                                                   33
    High levels of staff turn-over posed considerable obstacles to project coordination with the Project
Coordinator (PC) temporarily taking over FM and procurement functions (please see section 2.2 above).
In spite of these operational challenges and persistent delays, SSYS was able to successfully complete
essential capacity building activities planned under Component 1 and 289 sub- projects were developed
and implemented by young people under Component 2. In addition, in spite of a slow start, functioning
systems for project monitoring (MIS) were also established at MSATM level to collect information on
sub-project completion and youth participation rates.


Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance:

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

       Taking into account: (i) changes in overall government ownership of the YDP approach; (ii) the
systematic delays in project implementation and: (iii) limited responsiveness in addressing recurrent
procurement and FM issues overall Borrower Performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.


6.     Lessons Learned (both project-specific and of wide general application)


a. Lessons-learned with general applications

       There are four key lessons learned from YDP implementation that have wider implications for
other operations in Timor-Leste and other operations in post-conflict contexts.

        The first has to do with the relevance of continuing to work with youth as decision-makers in
fragile contexts (i.e. going beyond service provision and a focus on employment and education). As the
data from the BA highlights, young people valued YDP in particular because of the leadership roles they
were able to play in their communities. The feasibility of using CDD approaches to bridge the gap
between local government and disenfranchised youth, and the positive impacts this has in reducing
tensions at community level is a particularly important lesson. The BA was able to contrast YDP
achievements in terms of empowerment and youth participation with the results obtained by the ILO
support youth employment intervention and highlighted YDP’s unique role in promoting the
empowerment of young people at community level. The assessment indicated that while the ILO support
workfare program was likely to be more inclusive (offering more men and women from villages equal
work for equal pay), participants had no decision-making power over project design and
implementation. In this case youth were positioned as laborers, in contrast with YDP where they truly
considered themselves to be decision-makers (and valued their role as such).

        The second is the importance of conducting targeted analytical work (possible even in a
relatively short period of time) to inform design. The initial analytical work conducted by the team was
instrumental in highlighting a broad range of issues putting youth at risk and identifying key capacity
constrained. Where data collection took longer, the analysis was initiated and aimed to be completed
before project effectiveness.



                                                  34
        The third, point relates to the importance of a simple design. While the team acknowledged that a
number of complementary operations would potentially need to be put in place to address different
aspects of youth vulnerability, an effort was made to ensure that YDP itself addressed both short term
and medium/longer term needs of young people in rural and urban areas through community level
interventions and improvements in center-based services. Similarly, the range of sub-project activities at
community level brought another layer of complexity to the project by allowing both small-scale
infrastructure and livelihood sub-projects to be implemented. These two types of activities required very
different types of technical assistance, placing an increased burden on limited numbers of district level
staff. The amount of effort on the part of the implementing agencies and the WB team (in terms of
supervision) required to make progress on any of these fronts was significant. While this was
highlighted at the time of preparation, discussions with the broader CMU and the counterpart ultimately
resulted in this “dual approach? being pursued. In this regard, the WB may have underestimated existing
capacity challenges. While project activities were completed and set targets mostly met working of these
very different fronts with small-scale funds is likely to have contributed to issues with sub-project
quality and sustainability, limitations in the support provided to youth center activities and in the
changes brought about in SSYS capacity and improvement in management systems. Concentrating
efforts of both the borrower and the WB team on a smaller set of issues/front may have yielded better
results by “going deeper? and helped develop a replicable/better documented model either in terms of
outreach through Youth Centers or youth engagement in community development.

        A fourth related point has to do with the supervision model available for small grants of the size
of YDP. The weakness in the institutional context in Timor-Leste helps to explain a great deal of the
operational challenges during YDP implementation. Challenges in communication with district level
staff, language barriers (which played a role in the transmission of recommendations from Aide-
Memoires and Mission reports),34difficulties in selection and retention of qualified staff for key
positions (FM, Procurement and M&E) required a re-doubling of supervision efforts. While at the time
of design, the task team could count on a stronger in-country presence for follow-up (including a
dedicated Extended Term Consultant) changes in staffing at CO level and in the availability of TFs
meant that the team had to rely on more remote support and communications with the counterpart. The
supervision model adopted and considered more successful (based on lessons learned from other WB
operations) does rely strongly on additional TF resources, which help to ensure: (i) supervision by a
larger CO based team with technical inputs sought from DC staff as needed; (ii) Technical Assistance
provided directly to implementing agencies (by local or international consultants supervised by the WB
team and often working directly in counterpart agencies).

       The feasibility of putting in place this type of supervision mechanism will be important to
consider during the design phase of future operations. Building partnerships with donors with greater
country presence for project supervision may also be a complementary strategy to consider. In the case
of YDP closer partnerships with UNICEF and GIZ were pursued. However, given different areas of
focus of the different institutions during the project implementation period it was not possible to
advance this significantly. For future interventions, where such “overlap? of objectives exists,
leveraging in-country resources would be advisable.




34
     Where possible the task team worked with Bahasa speaking consultants, which helped to partly address language issues.

                                                              35
b. Project specific lessons-learned: capacity building and youth sub-projects

    The implementation of capacity building activities with SSYS indicated the importance of
complementing training events with more regular on the job coaching. YDP’s final capacity assessment
report highlighted the importance of a “continued? learning program to ensure greater impact of capacity
building activities in SSYS performance. This approach is expected to create a strong connection
between skills learned/additional skills needed and the roles/job of key staff members. A parallel can be
drawn with the type of training provided to Youth Center Management Committees. While all
considered the training provided to have increased their skills level, the extent to which they were able
to use this new knowledge was often constrained by the limited set of activities YC run in the absence of
additional donor funding. In one case, YC members trained had left to pursue other opportunities. As the
YCMC are volunteers this is likely to be a recurring situation, which could be partly addressed by
placing greater emphasis on “on the job training.?


  A number of lessons-learned have been generated through regular implementation support and the
BA findings on the design and implementation of Youth Sub-Projects as follows:

   1. Engaging youth in the implementation in community level activities brought about a sense of
      connection with local government and traditional authorities and of responsibility for seeing sub-
      project implementation through. The youth groups established for sub-project management were
      temporary but while in place included representation from a broad section of the community,
      which is likely to have had a positive impact on reducing tension among youth groups. The
      participatory elements YDP (including the direct management of financial resources) set it apart
      from other interventions as clearly outlined in the BA.

   2. Revising/further increasing the funding allocation formula for future interventions (based on the
      YDP experience) would be important to improve the quality of future CDD interventions. The
      initial level of funding was found to be insufficient to implement sub-projects that addressed the
      expressed needs of youth. Funding levels were therefore revised up from US$1.84 to US$2.5 per
      capita. Supervision noted, however, some persistent issues with the budgeting of proposals with
      some instances of unfinished sub-projects observed (due to lack of funding). In addition,
      implementation experience also highlighted the importance of strengthening technical capacity at
      district level both for the development of sub-project proposals and the supervision/quality
      control of implementation.

   3. Further strengthening the training of youth facilitators and deepening the initial situation
      analysis, would be important to address issues of possible elite capture identified through the
      BA. While youth obtained a significant degree of independence vis-à-vis traditional authorities at
      village level, the latter’s influence was still strongly felt (particular in steering the
      implementation of livelihood activities). Ensuring that youth groups are able to benefit from up
      to three project implementation cycles may also help build capacity and more independent
      decision-making power.

   4. Specialized technical assistance for livelihood activities is particularly relevant in contexts such
      as Timor-Leste where district level staff may have limited technical expertise. While
                                                   36
        employment is a key concern of young people the introduction of income generation activities
        introduced additional complexity in project design. Advice to youth groups on how to conduct
        market analysis, assess the potential profitability/sustainability of proposed activities and on how
        to develop a business plan would be particularly important. Additional social accountability
        measures may also be required to ensure adequate controls are maintained as the use of project
        funds for private goods generates additional challenges.

    Finally, YDP generated important lessons learned on Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E). Adopting a
more modest, basic M&E strategy using available resources may be more prudent. Small scale
interventions of this nature are likely to benefit greatly from targeted studies and process evaluations
that can generate results early on and can be very useful to inform timely corrective action.


7.    Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a)     Borrower/implementing agencies

        The completion report prepared by MSATM and SSYS (please see additional details in annex 7)
is very appreciative of the overall technical support provided by the task team. It highlights some of the
challenges with the support provided by the World Bank team on financial management and
procurement issues as well as in meeting WB FM, disbursement and procurement requirements. The
World Bank team is in agreement with the assessment made by the implementing agencies in this
regard. The report further highlights that while YDP provided important support to some of the
challenges faced by youth, a number of outstanding issues and challenges remain, most notably high
levels of youth unemployment. The report also stresses the renewed focus by SSYS in the
operationalization of the National Youth Policy and National Youth Fund with the support of additional
development partners.

     Annex 2. Outputs by Component


             a. Operationalizing the National Youth Policy

        The scope of this component was pro-actively reduced following the MTR. As outlined in
Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above, the initial design was somewhat ambitious particularly regarding longer
term capacity building objectives. While the challenges with institutional capacity likely to emerge
during implementation may have been under-estimated (particularly with regards to the implementation
of the planned Public Expenditure Review) the corrective re-structuring undertaken after the Mid-Year
Review allowed the team to focus on essential capacity building activities, taking into account the new
reality on the ground. The NYF related activities were dropped taking into account SSYS capacity
constraints. YDP, therefore, focused on two key interventions: (i) capacity building for its staff to
improve overall management capacity; and (ii) increased management capacity of the Youth Centers
Management Committees (YCMC).

        First, the final capacity assessment report issued in April 201235 highlighted some significant
limitations in the establishment of the SSYS performance monitoring system. Importantly, for purposes
of assessing overall project performance, the report highlighted the limited impact that capacity building
programs had on SSYS performance due to a strong reliance on one-off training events versus the use of
a more “hands-on?/on the job training approach. The assessment considered that the latter may have
been more effective in ensuring that learning be more directly relevant to SSYS operations.
Significantly, additional capacity building work was considered necessary to effectively operationalize
SSYS performance monitoring system in particular to produce Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that
effectively measure the institution’s performance.

         Secondly, all Youth Center Management Committees (interviewed during the ICR mission)
reported that the training provided as part of YDP had increased their management and leadership skills.
Improvements in Youth Center management at field level were, however, primarily a function of
individual YCMC resourcefulness, external partnerships and donor funding with the range of basic
activities implemented varying significantly. Basic operational funding provided by SSYS (US$500
monthly) was frequently received with delays and was insufficient to cover basic equipment
maintenance or fuel cost (all centers visited during the ICR mission relied to some extent on generators
for power supply). Lack of regular contact with SSYS and of a clear understanding of overall priorities
and criteria used for the allocation of funding (including that provided by external partners) remained
important concerns of all YCMC visited.

             b. Youth for Local Development

        Overall targets for community-level youth empowerment activities were met with strong youth
participation and high levels of satisfaction regarding the infrastructure put in place. In spite of the
limitations of the methodology used to assess overall opportunities for participation by young people

35
  Data used here is drawn from the capacity assessment implemented at project closure 2012. The analysis was carried out
by an independent consultant who assessed achievements in relation to the original capacity building interventions planned
with SSYS. It was based on a review of the implementation of training plans and a series of interviews with key SSYS staff.

                                                            39
and actual increases in participation rates in community development the Beneficiary Assessment (BA)
provided significant insights into the empowerment process established at the local level.

        The BA analysis highlighted the specific role of YDP in creating opportunities for genuine youth
participation notwithstanding the strong influence of traditional leaders at community level. YDP
extended established governmental structures down to aldeia level. While village leadership was found
to have strong influence in the overall process and youth were still able to express their will and
preferences through the YDP process. Interestingly, while some aspects in project selection and
implementation (like the choice of use of paid or voluntary labor, or the choice of location for small
scale infrastructure) were influenced by village leaders, other aspects involved a high degree of
autonomy, such as procurement and management of projects’ on-going uses.

        The assessment was also able to contrast YDP achievements in terms of empowerment and youth
participation with the results obtained by the ILO support youth employment intervention and
highlighted YDP’s unique role in promoting the empowerment of young people at community level. The
assessment indicated that while the ILO support workfare program was likely to be more inclusive
(offering more men and women from villages equal work for equal pay), participants had no decision-
making power over project design and implementation. In this case youth were positioned as laborers, in
contrast with YDP where they truly considered themselves to be decision-makers.

                             Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


         The nature of this intervention, focused primarily on promoting youth empowerment through
participation in community level activities, (as well as the compressed preparation time-frame), meant
that no economic analysis was initially conducted. The team intended to collect information on the
project’s economic impact using TF resources to be mobilized. These were, however, not secured and
remaining supervision funding was required for other priority activities. Specifically, the team chose to
use its limited resources to collect data on youth participation as the key measure of the project’s impact
given its focus on youth inclusion. While data from CDD operations both in the Region and in Timor-
Leste can provide proxy data on cost-benefit of YDP sub-project investments, the nature of these sub-
projects (primarily sporting facilities, recreational activities and small-scale livelihood investments) do
not lend themselves to an easy comparison with other interventions focused on productive investments.

        Secondly, YDP is a very innovative intervention in the East Timor context, with its focus on
promoting youth participation through a CDD approach and using community sub-project to: (i) build
the capacity of young people; and (ii) improve linkages between youth and traditional authorities. While
there are other interventions in Timor-Leste that focus on youth employment at the village level there
are no other comparable programs that would allow an appropriate cost-effectiveness analysis.

         Thirdly, the team considered comparing the cost of reaching out to youth using a community-
based approach with that of conducting similar types of interventions through Youth Center-based
activities. However, given the currently limited SSYS capacity to collect and process data on youth
center usage such analysis (that might provide insights/information on whether using existing MTSAM
structures and a network of community facilitators might prove more/less cost-effective than building a
network of youth centers to conduct outreach activities at district level) was not possible.

      Based on the currently available information it is, therefore, not possible to assess the efficiency
of YDP.

Annex 5.         Beneficiary Survey Results


      A Beneficiary Assessment (BA) was implemented under the guidance of the World Bank team
at project closure between September and October 2012. The BA focused on the following four
themes: (i) Participation and Development Priorities; (ii) Empowerment and State-Society Relations;
(iii) Youth Group Formation and Dynamics; and (iv) Youth Employment. It used qualitative research
methodologies in particular Focus Group Discussions36; and Key Informant Interviews. Information was
used to collect information from six treatment and four control communities. Treatment areas were
Tohumeta, Fahiria, Fatubosa (in Aileu) and Holsa, Sanirin, Rairobo (in Bobonaro) while control
communities were Maubisse and Liurai (in Ainaro) and Sau and Lakumesak (in Manatutu).

        Selection of sites took into account high and low participation rate, location (including at least
one remote village) and was also aimed at covering a variety of project types (physical construction
projects, productive livelihood projects, and projects which involved purchase of ready-made equipment
such as sewing machines and computers). Finally, pairing of treatment and control areas was done
taking into account underlying levels of tension using information on crime and violence. 37 A total of 39
respondents provided information on the key themes above. In treatment areas the following categories
of informants were systematically consulted: (i) village chief (chefe suco); (ii)Y-CIC member; (iii) non-
Y-CIC youth; (iv) and non-youth community member.

Key findings39

         Participating youth in the YDP villages showed a stronger understanding of the state, and
of the way the state implements local development interventions, than did youth from non-YDP
villages. This greater level of awareness may lead to greater independence in decision-making in the
future (although his hypothesis would need to be verified through further analysis). Youth (and others)
in YDP villages were overall satisfied with YDP, though some criticisms did arise, such as the perceived
low budget allocation leading to uncompleted projects. The impact of YDP was particularly noticeable
in more remote areas. In more accessible communities, there was a wider range of development
activities and educational opportunities which contribute to an overall higher level of understanding of
development projects among the youth.

        YDP opened up opportunities for youth to genuinely participate in local development (i.e
not offered by other government or non-government programs) in spite of the strong influence of
traditional leaders. This was recognized and appreciated by both youth and the broader community
during the BA. YDP extended established governmental structures down to aldeia level. While village
leadership was found to have strong influence in the overall process and youth were still able to express
their will and preferences through the YDP process. Many previous studies highlight that village
leadership is crucial to the way that local development is carried out in Timor-Leste. In all the six YDP
villages visited, the chefe suco and/or chefe aldeia influenced the selection and implementation of
projects to some extent. In control villages, other types of local development projects were invariably
led or influenced by village leadership. The extent of the influence on the part of village leadership
ranged from providing advice and support to the Y-CIC to meet administrative requirements to a


39
  The overall positive rating of the YDP should be understood in a context where there are few initiatives for youth in the
villages, and no other where the youth were the main implementers.

                                                              46
“capture? of the process to meet village leadership priorities (this was observed in Holsa where the focus
of the sub-project was the implementation of sporting activities where other higher priorities were
expressed by young people). 40 Interestingly, while some aspects in project selection and implementation
(like the choice of use of paid or voluntary labor, or the choice of location for small scale infrastructure)
were influenced by village leaders, other aspects involved a high degree of autonomy, such as
procurement and management of projects’ on-going uses. Finally, “members of Y-CIC, without
exception, felt a strong sense of responsibility about their projects. That is, Y-CIC members thought of
themselves as decision-makers. And moreover, they thought of themselves as decision-makers in a
government program, a program that linked their priorities with the priorities of the state.?41

           The beneficiary assessment also yielded important insights on how the benefits from
YDP were “distributed? among young people in the community. First, regarding the gender
dimension of participation, in the absence of specific targets for female participation in YDP activities
the majority of young people engaged in Y-CIC in treatment areas were men. Where women were
involved they tended to work as treasurers for the group. Secondly, and as noted in CDD interventions
globally, the benefits of participation (in terms of awareness raising, training, “empowerment’) are
primarily felt by the group of volunteers directly engaged in sub-project management (Y-CIC). The BA
further noted a common trend across treatment sites with more educated youth selected for Y-CIC
positions.

            There were significant variations in how benefits were distributed in small-scale
infrastructure sub-projects versus livelihood interventions. Most of the projects which focused on
public facilities (volley ball courts for example) facilitated inclusion as they are accessible for all youth
in the village. In most of the construction projects, youth beyond the Y-CIC were involved in providing
volunteer work, which further facilitated the integration of youth across the village. Livelihood projects
reached a smaller number of youth, and tended to be primarily driven by the Y-CIC members. The BA
noted a tendency for a certain degree of elite capture of these projects. Typically as the village head
placed a close family member in key roles in the Y-CIC. Given the potential to increase personal
income, there is a higher premium on being member of a successful Y-CIC of a livelihood project.

            The assessment found no incident where specific groups were explicitly prevented from
participation. Rather, the Y-CICs tended to comprise members from different previous youth groups,
including the Martial Arts Gangs (MAG), and were not exclusive along those lines. No cases where
encountered where the YDP had led to increased levels of conflicts or violence among youth. In all
villages, treatment as well as control sites, village leadership, district authorities and the youth
themselves reported on lower level of conflict compared to before the YDP, although this progress was
not ascribed primarily to the YDP but rather to a combination of factors as discussed below. YDP was
found to have occasionally contributed to reducing tensions at community level.

        Skills training and capacity building interventions at the local level. Skills were imparted to
participating youth in YDP through two main avenues: (i) training on sub-project development and
implementation; and (ii) livelihood activities/sub-projects that focused on income generation.

Skills gained through sub-project development: Importantly, the BA highlighted some difficulties on the
part of Y-CIC youth in meeting YDP requirements particularly in terms of financial management. One
village leader commented that it took the youth more than one project cycle to understand the
requirements of the project proposals. Due to the high mobility of youth and the transitional nature of
the Y-CIC, there might have limits to the extent to which youth were able to truly become familiar with
YDP requirements for sub-project management. Some Y-CIC members in the second cycle of project
implementation explicitly mentioned that they had approached former Y-CIC members from the first
cycle to assist in making the proposals and the reports. The process of making a proposal, managing a
project and implementing did provide new skills to some the involved youth. The information collected
through the BA does not allow the team to make an assessment as to whether young people are able to
apply these project management skills in other development activities. Nevertheless, youth who had
participated in the Y-CIC groups felt more comfortable in engaging in discussions on the general
development of their villages and had a better understanding of development priorities.

Skills and employment through livelihood sub-projects: While YDP was not conceptualized as a youth
employment project, the BA focused on understanding preoccupation with employment issues at
community level. These were found to be central among young people, particularly in communities
closer to urban areas where education levels tend to be higher and so do youth expectations. Overall the
YDP projects were found in the BA to have been too small to have an employment (sustainable self-
employment) effect. Nevertheless, several village leaders though that the YDP had contributed to
changing the mindset of the participating youth and matured their involvement in the overall
development of the village.

           The draft ICR report was shared with GoTL counterparts with a two week period allowed for
comments. The implementing agencies provided no detailed comments to the report but expressed their
no-objection to its content. A short Borrower Report was equally shared with the World Bank team
highlighting the following:

  i.   GoTL’s appreciation for the WB team’s responsiveness to youth at risk issues through YDP and
       the project’s role in reaching out to youth organizations at grass-roots level and involving young
       people as decision-makers in community level and youth center interventions;

 ii.   The implementing agencies positive feedback regarding the technical support provided
       throughout project implementation (including quality of supervision and the sharing of good
       practices and international experiences that were considered particularly helpful);

iii.   Limitations in the guidance received from the World Bank team in terms of procurement and
       financial management which, together with difficulties in the processing of withdrawal
       applications, were considered to have contributed to significant delays in project implementation;
       and;

 iv.   The remaining gap in Timor-Leste in terms of interventions that focus directly on youth
       employment issues. The implementing agencies also highlight the priority to be given to
       vocational training and employment policy going forward.
